Bromley]]{{sfn|Bromley|2012|p=14}} }}

The '''academic study of new religious movements''' is known as '''new religions studies'''' ('''NRS''').{{sfnm|1a1=Bromley|1y=2004|1p=83|2a1=Bromley|2y=2012|2p=13}}
The study draws from the disciplines of [[anthropology]], [[psychiatry]], [[history]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[religious studies]], and [[theology]].&lt;ref name="Teaching bromley"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2007|title=Disciplinary Perspectives on New Religious Movements: Views of from the Humanities and Social Sciences|encyclopedia=Teaching New Religious Movements|url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195177299.001.0001/acprof-9780195177299-chapter-3|accessdate=2014-03-17|date=|author=Sablia, John A.|edition=|pages=41–63|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195177299.001.0001|editor=David G. Brohmley}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eileen Barker]] noted that there five sources of information on [[new religious movements]] (NRMs): the information provided by such groups themselves, that provided by ex-members as well as the friends and relatives of members, organisations that collect information on NRMs, the mainstream media, and academics studying such phenomena.{{sfn|Barker|1989|pp=vii-ix}}

The study of new religions is unified by its topic of interest, rather than by its [[methodology]], and is therefore [[interdisciplinary]] in nature.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2004|1p=8|2a1=Melton|2y=2004b|2p=16}} A sizeable body of scholarly literature on new religions has been published, most of it produced by [[social science|social scientists]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bromley|1y=2012|1p=13|2a1=Hammer|2a2=Rothstein|2y=2012|2p=2}} Among the disciplines that NRS uses are anthropology, history, psychology, religious studies, and sociology.{{sfn|Bromley|2012|p=13}} Of these approaches, sociology played a particularly prominent role in the development of the field,{{sfn|Bromley|2012|p=13}} resulting in it being initially confined largely to a narrow array of sociological questions.{{sfn|Hammer|Rothstein|2012|p=5}} This came to change in later scholarship, which began to apply theories and methods initially developed for examining more mainstream religions to the study of new ones.{{sfn|Hammer|Rothstein|2012|p=5}}

The majority of research has been directed toward those new religions which have attracted a greater deal of public controversy; less controversial NRMs have tended to be the subject of less scholarly research.{{sfn|Melton|2004b|p=20}} It has also been noted that scholars of new religions have often avoided researching certain movements which tend instead to be studied by scholars from other backgrounds; the [[feminist spirituality]] movement is usually examined by scholars of [[women's studies]], African-American new religions by scholars of [[Africana studies]], and Native American new religions by scholars of [[Native American studies]].{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=8}}

==Historical development==
{{double image|right|Massimo Introvigne.jpg|208|Eileen Barker.jpg|140|Scholarly organisations devoted to the study of NRMs have been formed by academics like Massimo Introvigne (left) and Eileen Barker (right)}}

In Japan, the academic study of new religions appeared in the years following the Second World War.{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=3}}&lt;ref name="Gallagher, Eugene V 2007"&gt;Gallagher, Eugene V. 2007. "Compared to What? 'Cults' and 'New Religious Movements.'" History of Religions 47(2/3): 212.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s American sociologist [[John Lofland (sociologist)|John Lofland]] lived with Unification Church [[missionary]] [[Young Oon Kim]] and a small group of American church members in California and studied their activities in trying to promote their beliefs and win new members. Lofland noted that most of their efforts were ineffective and that most of the people who joined did so because of personal relationships with other members, often family relationships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/conversion.htm Conversion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121122133/http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/conversion.htm |date=2012-01-21 }}, [http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/Unification.htm Unification Church] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113080905/http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/Unification.htm |date=2012-01-13 }}, ''Encyclopedia of Religion and Society'', Hartford Institute for Religion Research, [[Hartford Seminary]]&lt;/ref&gt; Lofland published his findings in 1964 as a doctoral thesis entitled: 'The World Savers: A Field Study of Cult Processes', and in 1966 in book form by [[Prentice-Hall]] as ''[[Doomsday Cult: A Study of Conversion, Proselytization, and Maintenance of Faith]]''. It is considered to be one of the most important and widely cited studies of the process of [[religious conversion]], as well as one of the first sociological studies of a new religious movement.&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America: African diaspora traditions and other American innovations'', Volume 5 of Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America, W.

In Western nations the study of new religions became a distinct field in the 1970s;{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=4}} prior to this, new religions had been examined from varying perspectives, with [[Pentecostalism]] for instance being studied by [[church history|church historians]] and [[cargo cults]] by anthropologists.{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=4}} This Western  academic study of new religions emerged in response to growing public concerns regarding the emergence of various NRMs during the 1970s.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2004|1p=3|2a1=Melton|2y=2004b|2p=17}} By the latter part of that decade, increasing numbers of papers on new religions were being presented at the annual conferences of the [[American Academy of Religion]], [[Society for the Scientific Study of Religion]], and the [[Association for the Sociology of Religion]].{{sfn|Melton|2004b|p=20}} The manner in which the scholarly study of new religions rose to prominence due to the public perception that these movements were social threats bore similarities with the manner in which [[Islamic studies]] grew in Western nations following the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001.{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=8}} The study of new religions would only be fully embraced by the Western [[religious studies]] establishment in the 1990s.{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=4}}

In 1988, the charity [[INFORM]] (Information Network Focus on Religious Movements) was established by Barker, who was then a professor of sociology at the [[London School of Economics]]. The organisation was supported by the UK Home Office and the British established churches and was designed to conduct research and disseminate accurate information about new religions.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|pp=105–106}}
Barker established INFORM due to her "conviction that a great deal of unnecessary suffering has resulted from ignorance of the nature and characteristics of the current wave of [NRMs] in the West."{{sfn|Barker|1989|p=vii}}
Also in 1988, the Italian scholar [[Massimo Introvigne]] established [[CESNUR]] (Centre for Studies on New Religions) in [[Turin]]; it brought together academics studying NRMs in both Europe and North America.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|pp=106–107}} In the United States, CESNUR gained representation through the [[Institute for the Study of American Religion]] in [[Santa Barbara, California]], which was directed by [[J. Gordon Melton]].{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=107}}

Scholars of new religion often operate in a politicised environment given that their research can be cited in legal briefs and judicial decisions regarding NRMs.{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=6}} In Barker's view, academic research into NRMs had practical applications in dealing with the problems that people experience with regard to NRMs.{{sfn|Barker|1989|pp=x–xi}} It can, for example, provide accurate information about a particular religious movement that can help guide an individual's reactions to the group; "an awareness of the complexity of a situation might help people to avoid precipitous actions that would later have been regretted."{{sfn|Barker|1989|p=xi}} However, given that scholars of new religions often reject the stereotypes about "cults" promoted by the anti-cultist movements, they have often been criticised by proponents of the latter.{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=6}} Anti-cult groups have sometimes criticised scholarly groups such as these, claiming that they uncritically believe what NRMs tell them, that they are pro-NRM, or that they ignore the issues raised by ex-members.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=109}} They sometimes have accused academic researchers of being "[[cult apologists]]".{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2004|1p=7|2a1=Melton|2y=2004b|2p=21}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="55383">{{short description|General review of religious attitudes towards scientific descriptions of evolution, and where relevant, their counterclaims}}
Although biological [[evolution]] has been vocally opposed by some religious groups, many other groups accept the scientific position, sometimes with additions to allow for theological considerations.  The positions of such groups are described by terms including "[[theistic evolution]]", "theistic evolutionism" or "evolutionary creation".  Theistic evolutionists believe that [[existence of God|there is a God]], that God is [[Creator deity|the creator]] of the [[matter|material]] universe and (by consequence) all life within, and that biological evolution is a [[nature|natural process]] within that creation. Evolution, according to this view, is simply a tool that God employed to develop [[human being|human life]]. According to the [[American Scientific Affiliation]], a [[Christian]] organization of scientists:

{{quotation|A theory of theistic evolution (TE) — also called evolutionary creation — proposes that God's method of creation was to cleverly design a universe in which everything would naturally evolve. Usually the "evolution" in "theistic evolution" means Total Evolution — astronomical evolution (to form galaxies, solar systems,...) and geological evolution (to form the earth's geology) plus chemical evolution (to form the first life) and biological evolution (for the development of life) — but it can refer only to biological evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Craig Rusbult, Ph.D.|title=Evolutionary Creation|url=http://www.asa3.org/ASA/education/origins/te2-cr.htm|year=1998|publisher=American Scientific Affiliation|quote=A theory of theistic evolution (TE) — also called evolutionary creation * — proposes that God's method of creation was to cleverly design a universe in which everything would naturally evolve.

According to [[Eugenie Scott]], Director of the US [[National Center for Science Education]], "In one form or another, Theistic Evolutionism is the view of creation taught at the majority of mainline Protestant [[seminaries]], and it is the official position of the Catholic church".&lt;ref name="Scott, 271"&gt;* [[Eugenie C. Scott|Scott, Eugenie C.]], "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2952523 Antievolution and Creationism in the United States]", ''[[Annual Review of Anthropology]]'', Vol. 26, (1997), pp.&amp;nbsp;263–289.&lt;/ref&gt;

Theistic evolution is not a [[scientific theory]], but a particular view about how the science of evolution relates to religious belief and interpretation. Theistic evolution supporters can be seen as one of the groups who reject the [[conflict thesis]] regarding the [[relationship between religion and science]]{{spaced ndash}}that is, they hold that religious teachings about creation and scientific theories of evolution need not contradict. Proponents of this view are sometimes described as Christian [[Darwinism|Darwinists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Acceptance ==
This view is generally accepted by major [[Christian]] churches, including the [[Catholic Church]], [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]], [[Episcopal Church USA]], and some other [[Mainline (Protestant)|mainline Protestant]] denominations;&lt;ref name="Scott, 271"/&gt; virtually all [[Judaism|Jewish]] denominations; and other religious groups that lack a [[Biblical literalism|literalist]] stance concerning some holy [[scripture]]s. Various biblical literalists have accepted or noted openness to this stance, including theologian [[Benjamin Breckinridge Warfield|B.B. Warfield]] and evangelist [[Billy Graham]]. A 2007 poll showed that acceptance among American Buddhists, Hindus and Jews was higher than among any Christian groups (graph below). One recent survey, conducted by physicist [[Max Tegmark]], on "of how different US faith communities view origins science, particularly evolution and Big Bang cosmology." Although "[[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] reports that 46% of Americans believe that God created humans in their present form less than 10,000 years ago", it found "only 11% belong to religions openly rejecting evolution."&lt;ref&gt;[Max Tegmark, Eugena Lee, and Meia Chita-Tegmark, "The MIT Survey on Science, Religion and Origins: the Belief Gap", Feb. 11, 2013,http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/survey/survey.pdf, p. 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

With this approach toward evolution, scriptural creation stories are typically interpreted as being [[allegory|allegorical]] in nature.
Both Jews and Christians have considered the idea of the [[Allegorical interpretations of Genesis|creation history as an allegory]] (instead of a historical description) long before the development of Darwin's theory. An example in Christianity would be the earlier writings by [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] (4th century), though he later rejected allegory in favor of  literal interpretation.  By this Augustine meant that in Genesis 1 the terms "light", "day", and "morning" hold a spiritual, rather than physical, meaning, and that this spiritual morning is just as literal as physical morning.  Augustine recognizes that the creation of a spiritual morning is as much a historical event as the creation of physical light.&lt;ref name="PSCF3-88Young.html"&gt;[http://www.asa3.org/aSA/PSCF/1988/PSCF3-88Young.html Davis A. Young, "The Contemporary Relevance of Augustine's View of Creation" from ''Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith'' 40.1]&lt;/ref&gt; [In later work, Augustine said that "there are some who think that only the world was made by God and that everything else is made by the world according to his ordination and command, but that God Himself makes nothing".&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, JH (trans) (1982) "St. Augustine. The Literal Meaning of Genesis", Paulist Press, New York, p171&lt;/ref&gt;]  Three noted Jewish examples are that of the writings of [[Philo of Alexandria]] (1st century),&lt;ref name="book2.html"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/yonge/book2.html |title="Allegorical Interpretation, I" from ''The Works of Philo Judaeus'', translated by C.D. Yonge |accessdate=2013-06-18 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515164341/http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/yonge/book2.html |archivedate=2013-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maimonides]] (12th century) and [[Gersonides]] (13th century).&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Guide for the Perplexed]]'' 2:17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Jewish philosophy#Jewish Philosophy after Maimonides|Milchamot Hashem]]'' 6:8&lt;/ref&gt;

Theistic evolutionists argue that it is inappropriate to use [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] as a scientific text, since it was written in a pre-scientific age and originally intended for religious instruction; as such, seemingly chronological aspects of the creation accounts should be thought of in terms of a [[Framework interpretation (Genesis)|literary framework]].  Theistic evolutionists may believe that creation is not literally a week-long process but a process beginning in the time of Genesis and continuing through all of time, including today.  This view affirms that God created the world and was the primary causation of our being, while scientific changes such as evolution are part of "creatio continua" or continuing creation which is still occurring in the never ending process of creation.  This is one possible way of interpreting biblical scriptures, such as Genesis, that seem otherwise to be in opposition to scientific theories, such as evolution.&lt;ref name=Peters&gt;''Can You Believe in God and Evolution'', Ted Peters and Matrinez Hewlett&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spectrum of viewpoints ==
Many religious organizations accept evolutionary theory, though their related theological interpretations vary. Additionally, individuals or movements within such organizations may not accept evolution, and stances on evolution may have adapted (or evolved) throughout history.  There is considerable variance in overall acceptance of evolution between different countries, with studies showing that acceptance of evolution is lower in the United States than in Europe or Japan (only [[Turkey]] had a lower rate in the 34 countries sampled),&lt;ref name=miller-et-al&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1126746|title=SCIENCE COMMUNICATION: Public Acceptance of Evolution|year=2006|last1=Miller|first1=J.D.|journal=Science|volume=313|issue=5788|pages=765–6|pmid=16902112|last2=Scott|first2=EC|last3=Okamoto|first3=S}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attitudes within religious groups may differ somewhat between counties.

=== Bahá'í ===
In the [[Bahá'í Faith]], [[`Abdul-Bahá]], the son of the founder of the religion, wrote about the origin of life. A fundamental part of `Abdul-Bahá's teachings on evolution is the belief that all life came from the [[Common descent|same origin]]: "the origin of all material life is one..."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Effendi|1912|p=350}}&lt;/ref&gt; He states that from this sole origin, the complete diversity of life was generated: "Consider the world of created beings, how varied and diverse they are in species, yet with one sole origin"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|`Abdu'l-Bahá|1912|pp= 51–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; He explains that a slow, gradual process led to the development of complex entities:

:"[T]he growth and development of all beings is gradual; this is the universal divine organization and the natural system. The seed does not at once become a tree; the embryo does not at once become a man; the mineral does not suddenly become a stone. No, they grow and develop gradually and attain the limit of perfection"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|`Abdu'l-Bahá|1908|pp=198–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Christianity ===
{{See also|Allegorical interpretations of Genesis|Framework interpretation (Genesis)}}

Evolution contradicts a literalistic interpretation of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]; however, according to [[Catholicism]] and most contemporary [[Protestant]] denominations, [[biblical literalism]] in the creation account is not mandatory. Christians have considered allegorical interpretations of Genesis since long before the development of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s theory of evolution, or [[James Hutton|Hutton]]'s principle of [[Uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]]. A notable example is [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] (4th century), who, on [[theology|theological]] grounds, argued that everything in the universe was created by God in the same instant, and not in six days as a plain reading of Genesis would require.&lt;ref name="PSCF3-88Young.html"/&gt; Modern theologians such as [[Meredith G. Kline]] and [[Henri Blocher]] have advocated what has become known as the [[literary framework interpretation]] of the days of Genesis.

==== Contemporary Christian denominations ====
All of the traditional [[mainline Protestant]] [[Christian denomination|denomination]]s support or accept theistic evolution. For example, on 12 February 2006, the 197th anniversary of [[Charles Darwin]]'s birth was commemorated by "[[Evolution Sunday]]" where the message that followers of Christ do not have to choose between biblical stories of creation and evolution was taught in classes and sermons at many [[Methodism|Methodist]], [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]], [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalian]], [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]], [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]], [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]], [[United Church of Christ]], [[Baptist]] and community churches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/content/news_syndication/article_060220creationism.shtml Churches urged to challenge Intelligent Design  -20/02/06]&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the [[National Council of Churches]] United States has issued a teaching resource to "assist people of faith who experience no conflict between science and their faith and who embrace science as one way of appreciating the beauty and complexity of
God's creation." This resource cites the Episcopal Church, according to whom the stories of creation in Genesis "should not be understood as historical and scientific accounts of origins but as proclamations of basic theological truths about creation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncccusa.org/pdfs/evolutionbrochurefinal.html Science, Religion, and the Teaching of Evolution in Public School Science Classes] (pdf), The [[National Council of Churches]] Committee on Public Education and Literacy, [http://www.ncccusa.org/news/060330evolution.html Teaching Evolution], March 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The positions of particular denominations are discussed below.

===== Anglicanism =====
[[Anglicanism|Anglicans]] (including the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America]], the [[Church of England]] and others) believe that the Bible "contains all things necessary to salvation," while believing that "science and Christian theology can complement one another in the quest for truth and understanding." Specifically on the subject of creation/evolution, some Anglicans view "Big Bang cosmology" as being "in tune with both the concepts of creation out of nothing and continuous creation." Their position is clearly set out in the ''Catechism of Creation Part II: Creation and Science''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://episcopalscience.org/creation-science/ Catechism of Creation Part II: Creation and Science]&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview, the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] Dr [[Rowan Williams]] expressed his thought that "creationism is, in a sense, a kind of [[category mistake]], as if the Bible were a theory like other theories. Whatever the biblical account of creation is, it's not a theory alongside theories... My worry is creationism can end up reducing the doctrine of creation rather than enhancing it."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/religion/Story/0,,1735404,00.html ''The Guardian'', March 21, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; His view is that creationism should not be taught in schools.

===== United Methodist Church =====
The [[United Methodist Church]] affirms a Creator God and supports the scientific study of evolution.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"We recognize science as a legitimate interpretation of God's natural world. We affirm the validity of the claims of science in describing the natural world and in determining what is scientific. We preclude science from making authoritative claims about theological issues and theology from making authoritative claims about scientific issues. We find that science's descriptions of cosmological, geological, and biological evolution are not in conflict with theology." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umc.org/site/apps/nlnet/content3.aspx?c=lwL4KnN1LtH&amp;b=3082929&amp;ct=6715227] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607070533/http://www.umc.org/site/apps/nlnet/content3.aspx?c=lwL4KnN1LtH&amp;b=3082929&amp;ct=6715227 |date=2011-06-07 }}  The Book of Discipline of The United Methodist Church – 2008,  The United Methodist Publishing House.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===== Church of the Nazarene =====
The [[Church of the Nazarene]], an [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] Christian denomination, sees "knowledge acquired by science and human inquiry equal to that acquired by divine revelation," and, while the church "'believes in the Biblical account of creation' and holds that God is the sole creator, it allows latitude 'regarding the "how" of creation.'"&lt;ref name="msnbc.msn.com"&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20657204/site/newsweek/ "Can God Love Darwin, Too?" by Sharon Begley, ''Newsweek'', Sept. 17, 2007 issue]&lt;/ref&gt;

Powell]] (''[[Participating in God]]'').  These theologians see no major problem reconciling theology with the general theory of evolution.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

The Nazarene ''Manual'', a document crafted to provide Biblical guidance and denominational expression for Church members, states: "The Church of the Nazarene believes in the biblical account of creation ("In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth . . ."—Genesis 1:1). We oppose any godless interpretation of the origin of the universe and of humankind. However, the church accepts as valid all scientifically verifiable discoveries in geology and other natural phenomena, for we firmly believe that God is the Creator. (Articles I.1., V. 5.1, VII.)

===== Eastern Orthodox Church =====
The Eastern Orthodox Church is divided in two large categories, which might be labeled as compatibilism and dualism.

On the one hand, compatibilists hold that evolutionary science and theology are compatible and view them as complementary revelations of God. As God is the source of both his specific revelation of himself in the Christian faith and the source of the general revelation of himself in nature, the findings of science and theology cannot really contradict; the contradictions must be merely apparent and a resolution possible which is faithful to the truth of God's revelation.
Nicozisin (Father George) is a compatibilist.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.orthodoxresearchinstitute.org/articles/dogmatics/nicozisin_creationism.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, dualists hold that evolution can be incompatible with faith. They usually argue either that evolutionary science is philosophically based on a kind of naturalism or that God's specific revelation is infallible and therefore trumps the findings of human reason in the case of any conflict between them. This is often based on a suspicion of human reason to arrive at reliable conclusions in the first place. Their stance is somewhat similar to [[Averroism]], in that there is one truth, but it can be arrived at through (at least) two different paths, namely Philosophy and Religion.
Bufeev, S. V, is a dualist, preferring to see the spiritual level above the mechanical, physico-chemical, or biological levels; he attributes discrepancies between spiritual matters and scientific matters to be because of the purely naturalistic views of evolutionists.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.creatio.orthodoxy.ru/sbornik/sbufeev_whynot_english.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Roman Catholic Church =====
{{Main article|Evolution and the Roman Catholic Church}}
The position of the Roman Catholic Church on the theory of evolution has changed over the last two centuries from a large period of no official mention, to a statement of neutrality in the early-1950s, to limited guarded acceptance in recent years, rejecting the materialistic and reductionist philosophies behind it, and insisting that the human soul was immediately infused by God, and the reality of a single human ancestor (commonly called [[Monogenesis (disambiguation)|monogenism]]) for all of mankind. The Church does not argue with scientists on matters such as the [[age of the earth]] and the authenticity of the [[fossil record]], seeing such matters as outside its area of expertise. Papal pronouncements, along with commentaries by cardinals, indicate that the Church is aware of the general findings of scientists on the gradual appearance of life.  Indeed, Belgian priest [[Georges Lemaître]], astronomer and physics professor at the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|Catholic University of Louvain]], was the first to propose the theory of [[expansion of the universe]], often incorrectly credited to [[Edwin Hubble]]. In the 1950 [[encyclical]] ''[[Humani generis]]'', [[Pope Pius XII]] confirmed that there is no intrinsic conflict between Christianity and the theory of evolution, provided that Christians believe that the individual [[soul]] is a direct creation by [[God in Christianity|God]] and not the product of purely material forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Catholics and the Evolving Cosmos |first=John |last=Farrell |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703846604575447493644515142 |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=August 27, 2010 |accessdate=September 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2013|alt=Today}}, many members of the Church supports [[theistic evolution]](ism), also known as ''evolutionary creation'',&lt;ref name="Alberta"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.lastseminary.com/genesis-modern-science/Evolutionary%20Creation.pdf|title =Evolutionary Creation|quote=Evolutionary creation best describes the official position of the Roman Catholic Church, though it is often referred to in this tradition as 'theistic evolution.'|publisher = [[University of Alberta]]|accessdate = 2007-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Cardinal [[Joseph Ratzinger]], the International Theological Commission published a paper accepting the [[Big Bang|big bang]] of 15 billion years ago and the evolution of all life including humans from the microorganisms that formed approximately 4 billion years ago.&lt;ref&gt;"Communion and Stewardship: Human Persons Created in the Image of God."

=== Deism ===
{{See also|Deism}}
[[Deism]] is belief in a [[God]] or [[first cause]] based on [[reason]], rather than on [[faith]] or [[revelation]]. Most deists{{Who|date=June 2012}} believe that God does not interfere with the world or create [[miracle]]s. Some deists{{Who|date=June 2012}} believe that a [[Divine Creator]] initiated a universe in which evolution occurred, by designing the system and the natural laws, although many deists believe that God also created life itself, before allowing it to be subject to evolution. They find it to be undignified and unwieldy for a deity to make constant adjustments rather than letting evolution elegantly adapt organisms to changing environments.

One recent convert to deism was philosopher and professor [[Antony Flew]], who became a deist in December 2004. Professor Flew, a former [[atheist]], later argued that recent research into the origins of life supports the theory that some form of intelligence was involved. Whilst accepting subsequent Darwinian evolution, Flew argued that this cannot explain the complexities of the origins of life. He also stated that the investigation of [[DNA]] "has shown, by the almost unbelievable complexity of the arrangements which are needed to produce [life], that intelligence must have been involved."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/strangenews/atheist_philosopher_041210.html Atheist Philosopher, 81, Now Believes in God | LiveScience&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently clarified this statement in an interview with Joan Bakewell for BBC Radio 4 in March 2005: "What I was converted to was the existence of an [[Aristotelian view of God|Aristotelian God]], and Aristotle's God had no interest in human affairs at all."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/programmes/belief/scripts/antony_flew.html BBC interview, Professor Antony Flew] March 22, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Relevance inline|date=March 2012}}&lt;!-- No evidence that Flew is a TE, so how is this paragraph relevant? --&gt;&lt;!-- He accepts evolution, but believes in a deity. --&gt;

=== Hinduism ===
{{See also|Hindu views on evolution}}
Hindu views on evolution include a range of viewpoints with regard to [[evolution]], [[creationism]], and the [[origin of life]] within the traditions of [[Hinduism]]. The accounts of the emergence of life within the universe vary, but classically tell of the [[deity]] called [[Brahma]], from a [[Trimurti]] of three deities also including [[Vishnu]] and [[Shiva]], performing the act of "creation", or more specifically of "propagating life within the universe". with the other two deities responsible for "preservation" and "destruction" (of the universe) respectively.&lt;ref&gt;

Some Hindus{{Who|date=June 2012}} find support for, or foreshadowing of evolutionary ideas in [[Hindu scriptures|scriptures]], namely the [[Vedas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.well.com/user/jct/science.html | title=Science and spirituality: Any Points of Contact?

==== Day and night of Brahma ====
Science writers [[Carl Sagan]] and [[Fritjof Capra]] have pointed out similarities between the latest scientific understanding of the age of the universe, and the Hindu concept of a "day and night of Brahma", which is much closer to the current known age of the universe than other creation myths. The days and nights of Brahma posit a view of the universe that is divinely created, and is not strictly evolutionary, but an ongoing cycle of birth, death, and rebirth of the universe. According to Sagan:
{{quotation|The Hindu religion is the only one of the world's great faiths dedicated to the idea that the Cosmos itself undergoes an immense, indeed an infinite, number of deaths and rebirths. It is the only religion in which time scales correspond to those of modern scientific cosmology. Its cycles run from our ordinary day and night to a day and night of Brahma, 8.64 billion years long, longer than the age of the Earth or the Sun and about half the time since the Big Bang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Sagan | first =Carl | authorlink =Carl Sagan | title =[[Cosmos (book)|Cosmos]] | publisher =Ballantine Books | year =1985 | isbn =978-0-345-33135-9 }} p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Capra, in his popular book ''[[The Tao of Physics]]'', wrote that:
{{quotation|This idea of a periodically expanding and contracting universe, which involves a scale of time and space of vast proportions, has arisen not only in modern cosmology, but also in ancient Indian mythology. Experiencing the universe as an organic and rhythmically moving cosmos, the Hindus were able to develop evolutionary cosmologies which come very close to our modern scientific models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Capra | first =Fritjof | authorlink =Fritjof Capra | title =[[Tao of Physics]] | publisher =Shambhala | year =1991 | isbn =978-0-87773-594-6 }} p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==== Daśāvatāras and evolution ====
The British geneticist and evolutionary biologist [[J B S Haldane]] observed that the Dasavataras (ten principal avatars of Lord [[Vishnu]]) provide a true sequential depiction of the great unfolding of [[evolution]]. The avatars of [[Vishnu]] show an uncanny similarity to the biological theory of evolution of life on earth.&lt;ref&gt;

Lord Rama, Lord Krishna and Lord Buddha were the seventh, eighth and ninth other avatars of Lord Vishnu. It indicates the physical and mental changes and evolution in the man from its time of appearance.

=== Islam ===
{{See also|Islamic creationism}}
Some literalist Muslims{{Who|date=June 2012}} reject origin of species from a common ancestor by evolution as incompatible with the [[Qur'an]]. However, even amongst Muslims who accept evolution, many believe that humanity was a special creation by God. For example, Shaikh Nuh Ha Mim Keller, an American Muslim and specialist in Islamic law has argued in ''Islam and Evolution''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masud.co.uk/ISLAM/nuh/evolve.htm Evolution and Islam&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; that a belief in [[macroevolution]] is not incompatible with Islam, as long as it is accepted that "Allah is the Creator of everything" (Qur'an 13:16) and that Allah specifically created humanity (in the person of Adam; Qur'an 38:71-76). Shaikh Keller states in his conclusion however:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"As for claim that man has evolved from a non-human species, this is unbelief (kufr) no matter if we ascribe the process to Allah or to "nature," because it negates the truth of Adam's special creation that Allah has revealed in the Qur'an. Man is of special origin, attested to not only by revelation, but also by the divine secret within him, the capacity for ma'rifa or knowledge of the Divine that he alone of all things possesses. By his God-given nature, man stands before a door opening onto infinitude that no other creature in the universe can aspire to. Man is something else."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Ahmadiyya ====
{{See also|Ahmadiyya views on evolution}}
The [[Ahmadiyya]] movement also [[Ahmadiyya views on evolution|universally accepts]] the principle of the process of evolution with divine guidance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://itl-usa.org/ahmadi/ahmadi13.html  Jesus and the Indian Messiah – 13.

=== Judaism ===
{{See also|Judaism and evolution}}
In general, three of the four major [[Jewish denominations|denominations]] of American [[Judaism]] ([[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]], [[Reform Judaism|Reform]], and [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]]) accept theistic evolution. Within [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodoxy]], there is much debate about the issue.  Most [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] groups accept theistic evolution and most [[Haredi Judaism|Ultra-Orthodox]] groups do not.  This disagreement was most vociferous in the [[Natan Slifkin#Controversy|Natan Slifkin controversy]] which arose when a number of prominent Ultra-Orthodox Rabbis banned books written by Rabbi Natan Slifkin which explored the idea of theistic evolution within Jewish tradition.  These Rabbis forming part of [[Jewish opposition to evolution]] considered that his books were [[heresy]] as they indicated that the [[Talmud]] is not necessarily correct about scientific matters such as the [[age of the Earth]].

Advocates of theistic evolution within Judaism follow two general approaches. Either the [[Genesis creation myth|creation account]] in the [[Torah]] is not to be taken as a literal text, but rather as a [[symbol]]ic work, or, alternatively, that the 'days' do not refer to 24-hour periods. The latter view, called [[day-age creationism]], is justified by how the first day in the biblical account actually precedes the creation of the sun and earth by which 24 hour days are reckoned and by how the seventh day of rest has no evening and morning. In the day-age view, Jewish [[scholars]] point out how the order of creation in Genesis corresponds to the scientific description of the development of life on Earth—the sun, then earth, then oceans, then oceanic plant life, fish preceding land-based life, with mammals and finally humans last—and in no way specifies the method of creation in a manner prohibitive of evolution.

[[Karaite Judaism]] is a Jewish a movement which is distinct in that they do not accept the [[Talmud]] (a series of Rabbinic commentaries) as law and follow the Hebrew scriptures as they are written. Karaites are currently divided on the question of evolution with many or most Karaite Jews leaning in favor of Theistic Evolution.

=== Samaritanism ===
The [[Samaritans]], a divergent branch of the Israelites (the other being the Jews), generally accept Theistic Evolution. Samaritans do not consider themselves to be Jewish, but hold similar beliefs. The Jews, however, hold the [[Tanakh]] (consisting of the [[Torah]] or [[Pentateuch]], plus [[Nevi'im]], and [[Ketuvim]]) as canonical scripture in conjunction with the Oral Law as compiled in the Talmud, while the Samaritan's canonical scriptures consists only of the Torah (a slightly differing Pentateuch, i.e. the Five Books of Moses), but exclude both Nevi'im and Ketuvim, as well as excluding the Talmud.

=== Pantheism ===
[[Pantheism|Pantheists]] (for instance in [[Naturalistic Pantheism]]) may view natural processes, including evolution, as work or emanations from the impersonal, non-anthropomorphic deity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | title = The New Oxford Dictionary Of English  | publisher = Clarendon Press|year = 1998 | location = Oxford  | pages =  1341|isbn = 0-19-861263-X  | mr =   | zbl =  | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Deity"&gt;Owen, H.

== Proponents ==

=== Evolutionary biologists who were also theists ===
Although [[evolutionary biologists]] have often been [[agnostics]] (most notably [[Thomas Huxley]] and [[Charles Darwin]]) or [[Atheism|atheists]] (most notably [[Richard Dawkins]]), from the outset many have had a belief in some form of theism. These have included [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] (1823&amp;ndash;1913), who in a joint paper with [[Charles Darwin]] in 1858, proposed the theory of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]]. Wallace, in his later years, was effectively a [[deist]] who believed that "the unseen universe of Spirit" had interceded to create life as well as consciousness in animals and (separately) in humans.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Fichman, (2004). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=j2E293wQ63AC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false An elusive Victorian: the evolution of Alfred Russel Wallace]''. p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin had a longstanding close friendship with the American botanist [[Asa Gray]] who was a leading supporter of Darwin's theory, and a devout Presbyterian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/religion-historical-resources |title=Historical Resources |year=2009 |publisher=Darwin Correspondence Project |accessdate=2009-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gray wrote a series of essays on the relationship of natural selection to religious belief and [[natural theology]], and supported the views of theologians who said that design through evolution was inherent in all forms of life.&lt;ref name=Grayreviews&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/essays-reviews-by-asa-gray |title=Essays &amp; reviews by Asa Gray |publisher=Darwin Correspondence Project |accessdate=2009-12-14}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/gray-essay-evolution-theology |title=Essay: Evolution &amp; theology |author=Asa Gray |authorlink=Asa Gray |date=January 15, 1874 |work= Darwin Correspondence Project |publisher=The Nation |pages= |accessdate=2009-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin had Gray and [[Charles Kingsley]] in mind when he wrote that "It seems to me absurd to doubt that a man may be an ardent theist &amp; an evolutionist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-12041 |title=Letter 12041 — Darwin, C. R. to Fordyce, John, 7 May 1879 |publisher=Darwin Correspondence Project |accessdate=2009-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QhA2bpBR?url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-12041 |archivedate=2014-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early example of this kind of approach came from computing pioneer [[Charles Babbage]] who published his unofficial ''Ninth [[Bridgewater Treatise]]'' in 1837, putting forward the thesis that God had the omnipotence and foresight to create as a divine legislator, making laws (or programs) which then produced species at the appropriate times, rather than continually interfering with ''ad hoc'' miracles each time a new species was required.

[[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] (1881&amp;ndash;1955) was a noted geologist and paleontologist as well as a [[Jesuit]] Priest who wrote extensively on the subject of incorporating evolution into a new understanding of Christianity. Initially suppressed by the [[Roman Catholic Church]], his theological work has had considerable influence and is widely taught in Catholic and most [[mainline (Protestant)|mainline Protestant]] seminaries.

Both [[Ronald Fisher]] (1890&amp;ndash;1962) and [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]] (1900&amp;ndash;1975), were Christians and architects of the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]]. Dobzhansky, a Russian Orthodox, wrote a famous 1973 essay entitled ''[[Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution]]'' espousing evolutionary creationism:

:"I am a creationist and an evolutionist. Evolution is God's, or Nature's, method of creation. Creation is not an event that happened in 4004 BC; it is a process that began some 10 billion years ago and is still under way... Does the evolutionary doctrine clash with religious faith? It does not. It is a blunder to mistake the Holy Scriptures for elementary textbooks of astronomy, geology, biology, and anthropology. Only if symbols are construed to mean what they are not intended to mean can there arise imaginary, insoluble conflicts... the blunder leads to blasphemy: the Creator is accused of systematic deceitfulness."

In the realm of biology and theology, the saying coined by [[Thomas Jay Oord]] is perhaps appropriate: "The Bible tells us how to find abundant life, not the details of how life became abundant."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4730">'''Aclla''' ([[Quechuan languages|Quechua]]: '''aklla''' or '''aqlla,''' pl. '''aqllakuna'''), also called '''Chosen Women''', '''Virgins of the Sun''', and '''Wives of the Inca,''' were sequestered women in the  [[Inca Empire]].  They were [[virgins]], chosen at about age 10.  They performed several services. They were given in marriage to men who had distinguished themselves in service to the empire; they produced luxury items, weaving fine cloth, preparing ritual food, and brewing the [[chicha]] (beer) drunk at religious festivals; and some, the most "perfect", were selected as [[human sacrifices]] for religious rites.  Others lived out their lives in a [[monastery|monastic]] environment.&lt;ref&gt;Costin, Cathy Lynne (1998), "Housewives, Chosen Women, Skilled Men: Cloth Production and Social Identity in the Late Prehistoric Andes," ''Archeological Papers of the American Anthropological Association,'' vol. 8, No. 1, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selection and training==
The Inca Empire (1438-1533) created, or adopted from earlier cultures, several institutions to manage the labor of the people in the territory it ruled. Among the institutions were the [[mit'a]], the [[yanakuna]], and the aclla.

Each year the Inca government sent out representatives, called apupanaca, to collect girls eight to ten years old from the provinces as tribute for the state.  The girls selected were mostly from the higher social classes, frequently coming from the families of non-Inca provincial leaders. The girls were sent for training in provincial centers to live together in complexes of buildings called acllawasi (house of the chosen women) which might have up to 200 women in residence.&lt;ref&gt;D'Altroy, Terence N. (2003), ''The Incas'', Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt;

The girls were trained for about 4 years in religion, spinning and weaving, preparation of food, and brewing chicha.  They then became mamakuna (priestesses) and were married to prominent men or assigned to religious duties.  The most skilled and physically perfect were sent to [[Cuzco]], the capital of the empire, and might become secondary wives or concubines of the Inca emperor and other noblemen.  A few were destined to be sacrificed in a religious ceremony called [[capacocha]].&lt;ref name="INCA IMPERIAL DILEMMAS, KINSHIP, AND HISTORY"&gt;{{cite book |author=Irene Silverblatt |title=Inca Imperial Dilemmas, Kinship, and History |publisher=Comparative Studies in Society and History Vol. 30. No. 1: Cambridge University Press |date=January 1988 |location=83-102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently discovered archaeological evidence contained the remains of a male ''aclla''.&lt;ref name="Nova - Ice Mummies"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/peru/worlds/sacrifice1.html |title=The Sacrificial Ceremony |author=Liesl Clark |accessdate=2011-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social significance== 
The use of ''acllas'' was tied to [[kinship]] and the maintenance of [[hegemony]] within the empire. The family of a chosen ''aclla'' would be raised in social status. The ''acllas'' themselves would honour the main Inca [[god]]s and be honoured in return. Those not sacrificed at Cuzco might be returned to their own communities and be sacrificed there. This would create a ritual bond between Cuzco and the local region; Cuzco had taken a member of the local community and made them a representative of the central state. The ''aclla'' had been blessed by the Emperor and became the guardian of the local [[huacas]]. This signaled the entrance of the empire into local [[tradition]] and religion. This tying of the centre to the periphery was one of the most important aspects of the sacrifice of ''acllas''. The story of Tanta Carhua is one such account of the process of binding the centre and the periphery together.&lt;ref name="Nova - Ice Mummies" /&gt;

Colonial documents contain record of Tanta Carhua, who was sacrificed as a ''capacocha'' in her home [[ayllu]] of Urcon. After visiting Cuzco and being honoured by the emperor, Tanta Carhua was credited with saying “You can finish with me now because I could not be more honoured than by the feasts which they celebrated for me in Cuzco."&lt;ref name="Nova - Ice Mummies" /&gt; Upon her return home, Tanta’s father became the [[curaca]] of his [[ayllu]]. Tanta was deified and her “sacrifice... ritually asserted her father’s, and father’s descendants’, new role as a nexus between Urcon and Cuzco while dramatizing the community’s subordination to Cuzco.”&lt;ref name="INCA IMPERIAL DILEMMAS, KINSHIP, AND HISTORY" /&gt;

[[File:Uppercase Alpha and Omega in Times New Roman.svg|thumb|The Greek letters ''alpha'' and ''omega'']]
'''[[Alpha (letter)|Alpha]]''' ('''Α''' or '''α''') and '''[[omega (letter)|omega]]''' ('''Ω''' or '''ω''') are the first and last letters of the [[Greek alphabet]], and  a title of [[Christ (title)|Christ]] and [[God]] in the [[Book of Revelation]]. This pair of letters are used as [[Christian symbolism|Christian symbols]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gauding | first = Madonna | title = The signs and symbols bible : the definitive guide to mysterious markings | publisher = Sterling Pub. Co | location = New York, NY | year = 2009 | isbn = 9781402770043 |page=84 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and are often combined with the [[Cross (Christianity)|Cross]], [[Chi-rho]], or other Christian symbols.

==Origin==
The term ''Alpha and Omega'' comes from the phrase "I am Alpha and Omega" ([[Koiné Greek]]: "ἐγὼ τὸ Α καὶ τὸ Ω"), an appellation of [[Jesus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/bible/phillips/CP27RevelationRed.htm |title=The Book of Revelation|website=CCEL.org}}. The words are used by Jesus according to the translation of J. B. Philipps, in which he places these words in red to indicate that it is Jesus speaking.&lt;/ref&gt; in the Book of Revelation (verses 1:8, 21:6, and 22:13). The first part of this phrase ("I am the Alpha and Omega") is first found in Chapter 1 verse 8 ("1v8"), and is found in every [[manuscript]] of Revelation that has 1v8. Several later manuscripts repeat "I am the Alpha and Omega" in 1v11 too, but do not receive support here from most of the oldest manuscripts, including the Alexandrine, [[Sinaitic Palimpsest|Sinaitic]], and [[Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus]]. It is, therefore, omitted in some modern translations. Scholar Robert Young stated, with regard to "I am the Alpha and Omega" in 1v11, the "oldest [manuscripts] omit" it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Young, Robert|title=Young's Concise Commentary on the Holy Bible|page=180|date= 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity==
[[Alpha (letter)|Alpha]] (Α) and [[omega (letter)|omega]] (Ω) are the first and last letters, respectively, of the classical (Ionic) [[Greek alphabet]]. Thus, twice when the phrase "I am the alpha and the omega"  appears it is further clarified with the additional phrase, "the beginning and the end" (Revelation 21:6, 22:13). The first and last letters of the Greek alphabet were used because the book of Revelation is in the New Testament, which was originally written in Greek.

This phrase is interpreted by many Christians{{according to whom|date=January 2016}} to mean that [[Jesus]] has existed for all eternity or that God is eternal.  Though many commentators and dictionaries ascribe the title "the alpha and the omega"  to both God and to [[Christ (title)|Christ]],&lt;ref&gt;''The New Bible Dictionary'', edited by Alton Bryant; ''Bible Dictionary'' by Wm. Smith; and the ''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt; some secular sources argue otherwise. ''Barnes' Notes on the New Testament'' (1974) claims: "It cannot be absolutely certain that the writer meant to refer to the Lord Jesus specifically here ... There is no real incongruity in supposing, also, that the writer here meant to refer to God as such."&lt;ref&gt;''Notes on the New Testament, Explanatory and Practical'' by Albert Barnes. 1956, 1962, 1974. {{ISBN|978-0825422003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Christian denominations also teach that the title applies to both Jesus and his Father.

The letters Alpha and Omega in juxtaposition are often used as a Christian visual symbol (see examples). The symbols were used in [[early Christianity]] and appear in the Roman [[catacombs]]. The letters were shown hanging from the arms of the cross in [[Early Christian art]], and some [[crux gemmata]], jeweled crosses in precious metal, have formed letters hanging in this way, called [[pendilia]]; for example, in the [[:File:Escudo de Asturias.svg|Asturian coat of arms]], which is based upon the Asturian [[Victory Cross]]. In fact, despite always being in Greek, the letters became more common in Western than [[Eastern Orthodox]] Christian art.  They are often shown to the left and right of Christ's head, sometimes within his [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]], where they take the place of the [[Christogram]] used in Orthodox art.

==Judaism==
In [[Rabbinic literature]], the word ''emet''  (אמת meaning "truth"), one of the [[names of God in Judaism]], has been interpreted as consisting of the first, middle, and final letters of the [[Hebrew alphabet]].

==Islam==
The [[Qur'an]] gives ''al'Awwal'' (الأول), meaning "The First" and ''al'Akhir'' (الآخر), meaning "The Last" as two of the [[Names of God in the Qur'an|names]] of [[God in Islam|God]]: {{cite quran|57|3|style=nosup|expand=no}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34647">'''Aniconism''' is the absence of material representations of the natural and [[supernatural]] world in various [[culture]]s, particularly in the [[monotheistic]] [[Abrahamic religions]]. This ban may extend from only [[God]] and deities to [[saint]] characters, all living beings, and everything that exists. The phenomenon is generally codified by the religious traditions and as such becomes a [[taboo]]. When enforced by the physical destruction of images, aniconism becomes [[iconoclasm]]. The word itself derives from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] εικων 'image' with the negative prefix ''an-'' (Greek [[privative alpha]]) and the suffix ''-[[-ism|ism]]'' (Greek -ισμος).

==General aspects==
'''Monotheist religions''' – Aniconism was shaped in monotheist religions by theological considerations and historical contexts. It emerged as a corollary of seeing God's position as the ultimate power holder, and the need to defend this unique status against competing external and internal forces, such as pagan idols and critical humans. Idolatry was seen as a threat to uniqueness, and one way that prophets and missionaries chose to fight it was through the prohibition of physical representations.  The same solution worked against the pretension of humans to have the same power of creation as God (hence their banishment from the Heavens, the destruction of [[Tower of Babel|Babel]], and the Second Commandment in the biblical texts).

'''Aniconism as a construction''' – Some modern scholars, working on various cultures, have gathered material showing that the idea of aniconism is in many cases an intellectual construction, suiting specific intents and historical contexts, rather than a fact of the tangible reality (Huntington for Buddhism, Clément for Islam and Bland for Judaism – see below in notes and references).

==In Buddhism==
{{Main article|Aniconism in Buddhism}}
[[File:MaraAssault.jpg|thumb|An aniconic representation of [[Mara (demon)|Mara]]'s assault on the [[Buddha]], 2nd century CE, [[Amravati|Amaravati]],  [[India]].]]
[[Buddhist art]] used to be aniconic: the [[Buddha]] was represented only through his symbols (an empty [[throne]], the [[Bodhi]] tree, the [[Buddha footprint|Buddha's footprints]], the [[prayer wheel]]). This reluctance toward anthropomorphic representations of the Buddha, and the sophisticated development of aniconic symbols to avoid it (even in narrative scenes where other human figures would appear), seem to be connected to one of the Buddha's sayings, reported in the [[Dighanikaya|Digha Nikaya]], that discouraged representations of himself after the extinction of his body.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Although there is still some debate, the first [[anthropomorphic]] representations of the [[Buddha]] himself are often considered a result of the [[Greco-Buddhist]] interaction. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In the late 20th century, the well-established theory of aniconism in Buddhist art had been criticized by one art historian,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-ADM/huntin.htm|title=Early Buddhist art and the theory of aniconism|publisher=|accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the question has been the subject of continuing debate.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/4629413 "Aniconism and the Multivalence of Emblems"], Vidya Dehejia, ''Ars Orientalis'', Vol. 21 (1991), pp. 45-66 (Dehejia 1991); [https://www.academia.edu/4194715/In_the_Absence_of_the_Buddha_Aniconism_and_the_Contentions_of_Buddhist_Art_History(Thompson 2011)]; DeCaroli, Robert 2014: Image Problems: Art, Text, and the Development of the Buddha Image in Early South Asia.(DeCaroli 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Hinduism==
[[Image:Aikya Linga in Varanasi.jpg|thumb|Traditional flower offering to the aniconic [[Shiva linga]] in [[Varanasi]]]]
Although aniconism is better known in connection to [[Abrahamic religions]], basic patterns are shared between various religious beliefs including Hinduism, which also has aniconistic beliefs. For example, although Hinduism is commonly represented by such [[anthropomorphic]] religious [[murti]]s, aniconism is equally represented with such abstract symbols of God such as the [[Shiva linga]] and the [[saligrama]].&lt;ref&gt;Hinduism: Beliefs and Practices, by Jeanne Fowler, pgs. 42-43, at [https://books.google.com/books?id=RmGKHu20hA0C&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=Hinduism+murtis+shiva+linga&amp;lr=&amp;cd=18#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Books.Google.com] and Flipside of Hindu symbolism, by M.

===Byzantine iconoclasm===
{{main article|Byzantine iconoclasm}}
There were two periods of iconoclasm, or icon-destruction, in the [[Byzantine Empire]], in the mid eighth and early ninth centuries. The political aspects of the conflicts are complex, dealing with the relationship between the Byzantine Emperors, the [[Catholic Church]] and [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox Church]] councils, and the [[Pope]]. Theologically, the debate, as with most in Orthodox theology at the time, revolved around the two natures of [[Jesus]]. Iconoclasts believed that icons could not represent both the divine and the human natures of the Messiah at the same time, but separately. Because an icon which depicted Jesus as purely physical would be [[Nestorianism]], and one which showed Him as both human and divine would not be able to do so without confusing the two natures into one mixed nature, which was [[Monophysitism]], all icons were thus heretical. Reference was also made to the prohibitions on the worship of graven images in the [[Mosaic Law]].

===During the Protestant Reformation===
{{main article|The Reformation and art}}
Aniconism was also prevalent during the [[Protestant Reformation]], when some Protestants began to preach rejection of what they perceived as idolatrous Catholic practices which filled its churches with pictures, statues, or relics of saints. The Reformed (Calvinist) churches and certain sects (most notably the Puritans and some of the Baptist churches) began to prohibit the display of religious images.  A famous example of this comes from [[Oliver Cromwell]], who expelled [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]], and who once destroyed a golden relic placed in his church.

===Among Christians today===
In the [[Church of the East]], also known as the Nestorian church, opposition to religious images eventually became the norm due to the [[rise of Islam]] in the region, where it forbade any type of depictions of Saints and [[biblical prophets]]. As such, the Church was forced to get rid of their icons. This tradition is still in practice today, with many [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] churches lacking artistic depictions of biblical figures, including those of Jesus and Mary.&lt;ref name="Nestorian"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.touchstonemag.com/archives/article.php?id=21-05-027-f|title=The Shadow of Nestorius}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Amish]] continue to avoid photographs or any depictions of people; their children's dolls usually have blank faces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amishnews.com/amisharticles/amishand%20photos.htm "The Amish &amp; Photographs" ''Amish Country'' News Article by Brad Igou, (1991, 2001)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Among [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], followers are prohibited from wearing religious themed jewelry displaying icons such as the cross, as idol worship is prohibited. Having images or sculptures of Jesus, Jehovah (God), and angels are also considered a taboo according to their interpretation of Exodus 20:4,5 and 1 Corinthians 10:14.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2009094|title=Why Do Jehovah's Witnesses Not Use Images in Their Worship? — Watchtower ONLINE LIBRARY|website=wol.jw.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Followers are also admonished to avoid any objects portraying depictions of the supernatural. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/101974120?q=images+of+supernatural&amp;p=par#h=20|title=You, Too, Can Become Free — Watchtower ONLINE LIBRARY|website=wol.jw.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Islam==
{{main article|Aniconism in Islam}}

===Theological views===
The [[Qur'an]], the Islamic holy book, does not explicitly prohibit the depiction of human figures; it merely condemns idolatry (ex.: [[wikisource:Quran 5:87|5:92]], [[wikisource:Quran 21:51|21:52]]). Interdictions of figurative representation are present in the [[Hadith]], among a dozen of the hadith recorded during  the latter part of the period when they were being written down.  Because these hadith are tied to particular events in the life of the Prophet [[Muhammad]], they need to be interpreted in order to be applied in any general manner. [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] exegetes, from the 9th century onward, increasingly saw in them categorical prohibitions against producing and using any representation of living beings. There are variations between religious [[Madhhab|schools]] and marked differences between different [[Divisions of Islam|branches]] of Islam. Aniconism is common among [[Islamic fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] Sunni sects such as [[Salafis]] and [[Wahhabis]] (which are also often [[iconoclastic]]), and less prevalent among [[liberal movements in Islam]]. [[Shia|Shi'a]] and [[Sufi|mystical orders]] also have less stringent views on aniconism.  On the individual level, whether or not specific Muslims believe in aniconism may depend on how much credence is given to hadith (e.g. [[Submitters]] do not believe in any hadith), and how liberal or strict they are in personal practice.

Aniconism in Islam not only deals with the material image, but touches upon mental representations as well. It is a thorny question, discussed by early theologians, as to how to describe God, Muhammad and other prophets, and, indeed, if it is permissible at all to do so. [[Allah|God]] is usually represented by immaterial attributes, such as "holy" or "merciful", commonly known from His "[[99 Names of God|Ninety-nine beautiful names]]". Muhammad's physical appearance, however, is amply described, particularly in the traditions on his life and deeds ''[[Sira al-Nabi]]''. Of no less interest is the validity of sightings of holy personages made during dreams.

===Aniconism in practice===
[[File:Miraj by Sultan Muhammad.jpg|thumb|[[Persian miniature]] painting from the 16th century CE, depicting Muhammad, his face veiled, ascending on the [[Buraq]] into the Heavens, a journey known as the [[Isra and Mi'raj|Mi'raj]].]]
'''Religious core''' – In practice, the core of normative religion in [[Islam]] is consistently aniconic. Its embodiment are spaces such as the [[mosque]] and objects like the [[Qur'an]] or the white dress of pilgrims entering [[Mecca]], deprived of figurative images. Other spheres of religion – schisms, mysticism, popular piety, private level – exhibit in this regard significant variability. Profane aniconism is even more fluctuating. Generally speaking aniconsim in Islamic societies is restricted in modern times to specific religious contexts, while its prevalence in the past wasn't enforced in numerous areas and during extended periods.

'''Present''' – Depending on which segment of Islamic societies are referred to, the application of aniconism is characterized with noteworthy differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brill.nl/m_catalogue_sub6_id7561.htm |title=See 'Sura' and 'Taswir' in ''Encyclopaedia of Islam''|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929230552/http://www.brill.nl/m_catalogue_sub6_id7561.htm |archive-date=2007-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Factors are the epoch considered, the country, the religious orientation, the political intent, the popular beliefs, the private benefit or the dichotomy between reality and discourse.  Today, the concept of an aniconic Islam coexists with a daily life for Muslims awash with images.  TV stations and newspapers (which do present still and moving representations of living beings) have an exceptional impact on public opinion, sometimes, as in the case of [[Al Jazeera|Al-Jazira]], with a global reach, beyond the Arabic speaking and Muslim audience. Portraits of secular and religious leaders are omnipresent on banknotes &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geoinfo.nmt.edu/staff/scholle/graphics/banknotes/SaudiNote22a.html |title=Petroleum-related banknotes: Saudi Arabia: Oil Refinery|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720014731/http://geoinfo.nmt.edu/staff/scholle/graphics/banknotes/SaudiNote22a.html |archive-date=July 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geoinfo.nmt.edu/staff/scholle/graphics/banknotes/IranNote91c.html |title=Petroleum-related banknotes: Iran: Abadan Refinery, Iahanshahi-Amouzegar|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720015444/http://geoinfo.nmt.edu/staff/scholle/graphics/banknotes/IranNote91c.html |archive-date=July 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and coins,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://njmark0.tripod.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/.pond/bahrain500fills00000.jpg.w300h295.jpg}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; in streets and offices (e.g.: presidents like [[Nasser]] and [[Mubarak]], [[Yasser Arafat|Arafat]], [[Hafiz Al-Asad|Al-Asad]] or [[Hezbollah]]'s [[Hasan Nasrallah|Nasrallah]] and ayatollah [[Khomeini]]). Anthropomorphic statues in public places are to be found in most Muslim countries  ([[Saddam|Saddam Hussain]]'s are infamous &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2004/Jul/05/mn/mn03a.html |author=David Zucchino |title=U.S. military, not Iraqis, behind toppling of statue|newspaper=Honolulu Advertiser|date=July 5, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;), as well as Arts schools training sculptors and painters.  In the Egyptian countryside, it is fashionable to celebrate and advertise the returning of pilgrims from Mekka on the walls of their houses. Sometimes those who profess aniconism will practice figurative representation (cf. portraits of [[Taliban]]s from the [[Kandahar]] photographic studios during their imposed ban on photography&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Anderson, Thomas Dworzak, ''Taliban'', London (UK), Trolley, 2003, {{ISBN|0954264851}}.&lt;/ref&gt;). For [[Shia|Shi'a]] communities, portraits of the major figures of Shi'ite history are important elements of religious devotion.

Extreme rarities are an illustrated Qur'an depicting Muhammad and, in a Spanish-Muslim manuscript datable from the 16th century, five Ummayad and Abbasid caliphs. [[Iblis]] too is present in various illustrated manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antiqillum.com/slideshows/Nativities/|title=antiqillum.com|publisher=|accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There aren't, however, known figurative depictions of God.

'''Circumvention methods''' – Medieval Muslim artists found various ways not to infringe any prohibition of the image, while still representing living beings. It can be argued that since God is absolute, the act of depiction  is his own and not that of a human; and miniatures are obviously very crude representations of the reality, so the two can't be mistaken.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/livres/article/2011/07/07/les-choses-comme-elles-sont-une-initiation-au-bouddhisme-ordinaire-d-herve-clerc-et-bouddha-mode-d-emploi-de-jack-kornfield_1545789_3260.html|title=Hervé Clerc et Jack Kornfield : championnats de Bouddha libre|first=Roger-Pol|last=Droit|date=7 July 2011|publisher=|accessdate=24 December 2016|via=Le Monde|newspaper=Le Monde.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the material level, prophets in manuscripts can have their face covered by a veil&lt;ref name="expositions1"/&gt; or all humans have a stroke drawn over their neck, a symbolical cut defending them to be alive. [[Islamic calligraphy|Calligraphy]], the most Islamic of arts in the Muslim world, has also its figurative side due to anthropo- and zoomorphic [[Islamic calligraphy#Calligrams|calligrams]].

==In Judaism==
{{main article|Aniconism in Judaism}}

===The Tanakh===
A number of verses in the [[Hebrew Bible]] ([[Tanakh]]) refer to prohibitions against the creation of various forms of images, invariably linked directly with [[idolatry]]. The strongest over-all source is based on what [[Judaism]] counts as the second of the [[Ten Commandments]]:

:Do not have any other gods before Me. ''Do not represent [such] gods by any carved statue or picture of anything in the heaven above, on the earth below, or in the water below the land''. Do not bow down to [such gods] or worship them. I am God your Lord, a God who demands exclusive worship.  Where My enemies are concerned, I keep in mind the sin of the fathers for [their] descendants, to the third and fourth [generation]. But for those who love Me and keep My commandments, I show love for thousands [of generations]. ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 20:3-6)

This prohibition is widespread. For instance, [[Leviticus]] 26:1 reads:

:[Therefore,] do not make yourselves false gods. ''Do not raise up a stone idol or a sacred pillar for yourselves.'' Do not place a kneeling stone in your land so that you can prostrate yourselves on it. I am God your Lord.

Similar injunctions appear in [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 33:52, [[Deuteronomy]] 4:16, and 27:15; in all cases, the creation of the image is associated with idolatry, and indeed, the words commonly translated as "image" or some variant thereof (פסל ''pesel'', שקוץ ''shikuts'') are generally used interchangeably with words typically translated as "idol" (e.g., אליל ''elil'').&lt;ref&gt;See http://search.  freefind.com/find.html?id=6433772&amp;pageid=r&amp;mode=ALL&amp;query=image&amp;n=0&amp;s=et for a list of all verses containing the word ''image'' as translated by the [[Jewish Publication Society of America Version|JPS edition]].&lt;/ref&gt; (An important exception is צלם ''tselem'', used in such verses as Genesis 1:26: "let us make man in our image". This word was not associated with idols.)

Based on these prohibitions, the Hebrew prophets, such as [[Isaiah]], [[Jeremiah]], [[Amos (prophet)|Amos]] and others, preached very strongly against idolatry.  In many of their sermons, as recorded in the biblical books bearing their names, the prophets regarded the use of religious images as a negative sign of assimilation into the surrounding [[pagan]] cultures of the time.

===The Halakha===
Despite the semantic association with idols, [[Halakha]] ("Jewish law") as taught by the [[Shulkhan Arukh]] ("Code of Jewish Law") and still practiced and applied by [[Orthodox Judaism]] today, interprets the verses as prohibiting the creation of certain types of graven images of people, angels, or astronomical bodies, whether or not they are actually used as idols. The Shulkhan Arukh states: "It is forbidden to make complete solid or raised images of people or angels, or any images of heavenly bodies except for purposes of study".&lt;ref name="Torah.org 2016"&gt;{{cite web|title=Shulchan-Aruch - Chapter 11 |website=Torah.org |url=http://torah.org/advanced/shulchan-aruch/classes/chapter11.html# |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401043629/http://torah.org/advanced/shulchan-aruch/classes/chapter11.html%23 |archive-date=2016-04-01 |dead-url=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; ("Heavenly bodies" are included here because the stars and planets were worshipped by some religions in human forms.  Astronomical models for scientific purposes are permitted under the category of "study.") 
[[File:BH Exodus.jpg|thumb|450px|An illustration from the ''Birds' Head Haggadah'', c. 1300, illustration of the [[Book of Exodus]]. The fleeing Jews are depicted with birds' heads, while Pharaoh and most of the pursuing Egyptians have blank circles with or without eyes as heads; two of them, however, have bird's heads.  The [[Judenhut]] hats are typical of 14th-century Germany.]]

===Differences across media===
Although the prohibition applies mainly to sculpture, there are some authorities who prohibit two-dimensional full-face depictions.  Some base this upon their understanding of the [[Talmud]], and others based it upon [[Kabbalah]].  Of note is the portrait of Rabbi Tzvi Ashkenazi (known as "the Hakham Tzvi"),  which is housed in the  [http://www.jewishmuseum.org.uk/ Jewish Museum in London].  Based on his interpretation of this prohibition, the Hakham Tzvi refused to sit for his portrait.  However, the London Jewish Community wanted a portrait, so they commissioned the portrait to be done without the Hakham Tzvi's knowledge.  The Hakham Tzvi's son, Rabbi [[Jacob Emden]], says it was a perfect likeness.

Additionally, there is one type of representation, namely, [[bas-relief]] or raised representation on a flat surface, that is particularly problematic.  Rabbi [[Jacob Emden]] discusses a medal struck in honor of Rabbi [[Eliezer Horowitz]] that features Horowitz's portrait.  Emden ruled this violated the injunction against depictions.  Furthermore, many hold that such representations in the synagogue either violate this injunction or are not permitted, as they give the appearance of violating this injunction.  Most notably, Rabbi David ibn Zimra and Rabbi [[Joseph Karo]] hold that carvings of lions (e.g., representing the [[Lion of Judah]]) are inappropriate in synagogues.
[[File:Dura Europos fresco Jews cross Red Sea.jpg|thumb|''Crossing the Red Sea'', from [[Dura Europos synagogue]], with two [[Hand of God (art)|Hands of God]], 3rd century]]

On the other hand, some authorities hold that Judaism has no objection to photography or other forms of two-dimensional art, and depictions of humans can be seen in religious books such as the [[Passover]] [[Haggadah]], as well as children's books about biblical and historical personages.  Although most [[Hasidic]] Jews object to having televisions in their homes, this is not related to prohibitions against idolatry, but, rather, to the content of network and cable programming.  Hasidim of all groups regularly display portraits of their [[Rebbe]]s, and, in some communities, the children trade "rabbi cards" that are similar to [[baseball cards]].  In both [[Hasidic]] and [[Orthodox Judaism]], taking photographs or filming are forbidden on the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] and [[Jewish holiday|Jewish holy days]], but this prohibition has nothing to do with idolatry.  Rather, it is related to the prohibition against [[39 categories of activity prohibited on Shabbat|working or creating]] on these days.

===In modern times===
Although, in biblical times, Jews were actively [[iconoclasm|iconoclasts]], physically tearing down and destroying idols of other religions located within their political jurisdiction, today there is more tolerance for other cultures.  In the state of [[Israel]], all religious sites, Jewish and non-Jewish alike, are protected by law.  Even though Jewish Law teaches that idolatry is forbidden to all of humanity as one of the seven [[Noahide Laws]], Jews today combat it through discussion, debate, and education, rather than the physical destruction of statues and shrines.  However, many traditional Jews still follow the prohibitions against entering places of idolatry, and will not attend functions held in buildings where there are religious statues.

In a refutation of the belief in an aniconic Judaism, and more generally in an underestimation of Jewish visual arts, the historian of ideas Kalman Bland recently proposed that the phenomenon is a modern construction, and that "Jewish aniconism crystallized simultaneously with the construction of modern Jewish identities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pupress.princeton.edu/chapters/i6833.pdf|title=(Bland 2001:8)|website=princeton.edu|accessdate=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the Bahá'í Faith==
{{Main article|Aniconism in the Bahá'í Faith}}
For the followers of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], the photographs and depictions of the [[Báb]] and [[Bahá'u'lláh]], who are considered [[Manifestation of God|Manifestations of God]], are considered very precious.  They are viewed and handled with reverence and respect, and their existence itself is not considered offensive.  However, [[Shoghi Effendi]], the Guardian of the Bahá'í Faith, stated that believers should only view the images when they can be treated with the utmost respect, and not let them be exposed to the public or displayed in their private homes:
:"There is no objection that the believers look at the picture of Bahá'u'lláh, but they should do so with the utmost reverence, and should also not allow that it be exposed openly to the public, even in their private homes."
::(From a letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer, December 6, 1939, republished in ''Lights of Guidance'', p. 540)

Shoghi Effendi has also written in the ''Directives from the Guardian'' regarding the portrait of the [[Báb]]:
:"The portrait of the Báb should be regarded as an inestimable privilege and blessing to behold, as past generations were denied a glimpse of the Face of the Manifestation, once He had passed on."&lt;ref&gt;Shoghi Effendi: ''Directives from the Guardian'' Published in 1973.  Accessed on February 2, 2006 from http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/DG/dg-115.html.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;De Vries, Jelle:  ''The Babi Question You Mentioned?The Origins of the Bahá'í Community of the Netherlands'', pg. 243.  Peeters Publishers, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
::(Shoghi Effendi, Directives from the Guardian, p. 43)

Two pictures of Bahá'u'lláh and a portrait of the Báb are on display at the [[Bahá'í World Centre]] in the [[International Archives]] building, where the Bahá'ís view it as part of an organized [[Bahá'í pilgrimage|pilgrimage]].

==Other religions==
In [[African art|Africa]] aniconism varies from culture to culture from elaborate masks and statues of humans and animals to their total absence. A common feature, however, across the continent is that the "High God" is not given material shape. On the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]], the Roman historian [[Tacitus]] writes the following: "They don't consider it mighty enough for the Heavens to depict Gods on walls or to display them in some human shape."&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}}/{{la icon}} [[Publius Cornelius Tacitus]], "9. Götterverehrung", ''Germania (De origine et situ Germanorum liber)'', Reclam, Stuttgart, 2000, {{ISBN|3-15-009391-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His observation is not general to all German people as documentary evidence suggests (see [[Ardre image stone]]s).

In [[Australian Aboriginal culture]] there is a prohibition and tribal lore and custom contravening the depiction of the newly or recently dead, including photographs, because it is believed that depicting them will inhibit their passage to the [[Dreamtime|Great Dreaming]] of the Ancestors. This has led some Australian newspapers to publish apologies alongside [[obituaries]].

'''Animatism''' is a term coined by British [[anthropologist]] Robert Marett to refer to "a belief in a generalized, impersonal power over which people have some measure of control".&lt;ref name="Ferraro, Gary 2008. p. 340"&gt;Ferraro, Gary. 2008. ''Cultural Anthropology: An Applied Perspective, 7th ed.'' Belmont, CA: Thompson Wadsworth. p. 340&lt;/ref&gt; Marett argues that certain cultures believe "people, animals, plants, and inanimate objects were endowed with certain powers, which were both impersonal and supernatural."&lt;ref name="Ferraro, Gary 2008. p. 340" /&gt; ''[[Mana]]'', Marett states, is a concentrated form of animatistic force found within any of these objects that confer power, strength, and success.&lt;ref&gt;Ferraro, Gary. 2008. ''Cultural Anthropology: An Applied Perspective, 7th ed.'' Belmont, CA: Thompson Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aumism''' is a minor religious sect founded in 1969 by Gilbert Bourdin (1924-1998). Centered on the "holy city" of Mandarom, near [[Castellane]] in the French Alps, it has approximately 400 members, down from 1200 at its peak. It is a synthesis of a number of religions, notably [[buddhism]]. Its name derives from the mystical "[[Om|aum]]" sound used in Hindu meditation.

==Bourdin==
Gilbert Bourdin (1924-1998), also known as Hamsah Manarah self-proclaimed "Cosmoplanetary Messiah of Synthesis" founded the movement in 1969 after immersing himself in many oriental religions.

==Mandarom==
The holy city of Mandarom Shambhasalem was founded in 1969, about 50 kilometres northwest of [[Cannes]]. Bourdin progressively built a number of temples and statues. Amongst these is a 22-metre statue of Buddha Maitreya, constructed in 1981, and a 21-metre statue of "Cosmic Christ" wielding a sword and shield, constructed in 1987. In 1990, a 33-metre statue of Bourdin was constructed at Mandarom. The legitimacy of the building permit was later challenged, and eventually, in June 2000, the statue was deemed illegal after a long legal dispute.&lt;ref name=Earth&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1528231.stm "French guru crashes to earth"], BBC News, 6 September 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, it was demolished by the authorities on 6 September 2001.&lt;ref name=Earth/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thierry Boinet, [http://www.wwrn.org/article.php?idd=14070&amp;sec=55&amp;con=2 "Statue of Cult Leader Destroyed"]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Associated Press (WorldWide Religious News), 6 September 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cosmo&gt;Pierre Thebault, [http://www.wwrn.org/article.php?idd=14041&amp;sec=55&amp;con=2 "'Cosmoplanetary' French statue plunges to earth"]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Reuters (WorldWide Religious News), 6 September 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The sect denounced the demolition of Bourdin's statue, saying that it was comparable to the destruction of the [[Buddhas of Bamyan]] by the [[Taliban]] in [[Afghanistan]] earlier in the year.&lt;ref name=Earth/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cosmo/&gt;

'''The Center for Jewish–Christian Understanding and Cooperation''' or '''CJCUC''' is an educational institution at which Christians who tour Israel can study the [[Hebrew Bible]] with [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] rabbis and learn about the Hebraic roots of Christianity. The center was established in [[Efrat]] in 2008 by Rabbi Dr. [[Shlomo Riskin]], who has been described as "the most prominent rabbinic spokesperson to Christian Zionists".&lt;ref name=jesus&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14755610.2011.633537|title=The Messiah and Rabbi Jesus: Policing the Jewish–Christian border in Christian Zionism|journal=Culture and Religion: An Interdisciplinary Journal|first=Faydra L.|last=Shapiro|year=2012|volume=12|issue=4|pages=463–477|doi=10.1080/14755610.2011.633537}}&lt;/ref&gt; CJCUC partners with major Christian interfaith organizations such as [[Christians United for Israel]] and the [[International Christian Embassy Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name=jesus/&gt;

== History ==
The ideological groundwork, which led to the eventual establishment of CJCUC in 2008, began to take shape almost 50 years beforehand. In 1964, Rabbi [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik]], the teacher and mentor of CJCUC's Chancellor and Founder, [[Shlomo Riskin]], published an essay entitled "Confrontation"&lt;ref&gt;''Confrontation'', Tradition 6:2 p5-9, 1964. Reprinted in "A Treasury of Tradition", Hebrew Publishing Co, NY, 1967. – {{OCLC|1974913}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he expounded his views on interfaith dialogue and carefully drew out guidelines which permitted such a dialogue and, in the view of Riskin, not only permitted it but rendered it necessary.

At around the same time, fundamental ideological shifts were forming within the ranks of the Catholic Church, and a year after Soloveitchik's essay was published, [[The Holy See]] issued ''[[Nostra aetate]]'', the Declaration on the Relation of the Church with Non-Christian Religions. ''Nostra aetate'' absolved the Jews from the [[crucifixion of Jesus]], and admitted that religious antisemitism had a significant role in laying the foundation for the atrocities perpetrated against the Jewish people.

Riskin's academic plunge into Jewish–Christian relations began in the early 1960s when he attended seminars, held by Professor [[David Flusser]], about the Christian Gospels at The [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. As an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jew]], he could pinpoint the parallels for Jesus' teachings within the Hebrew scripture.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.scribd.com/doc/93213735/gadol-2 Shabat HaGadol]'' – translated from Hebrew – page 15&lt;/ref&gt;

After settling in Efrat, Riskin began to engage with the Christian world. Most of the Christian visitors to Efrat, those who came to hear and learn, were [[Evangelicalism|Evangelicals]]. He formed relations with Rev. Robert Stearns of Eagles' Wings and with Pastor [[John Hagee]].&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.scribd.com/doc/93213735/gadol-2 Shabat HaGadol]'' – translated from Hebrew – page 18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="shabbat-gadol"&gt;{{cite web|language=he|url=https://musaf-shabbat.com/2012/05/17/%D7%93%D7%99%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%92-%D7%99%D7%94%D7%95%D7%93%D7%99-%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%A6%D7%A8%D7%99-%D7%97%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%91%D7%94-%D7%9E%D7%97%D7%95%D7%93%D7%A9%D7%AA-%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%9E%D7%94/|title=Jewish–Christian Dialogue: Rethinking|first=Zur|last=Erlich|publisher=[[Makor Rishon]]|date=17 May 2012|access-date=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

of biblical sites such as nearby [[Jerusalem]], the Path of the Patriarchs and the Herodian wells.
Among the subjects that the seminar series includes are Jewish–Christian Relations; the Theology
of Biblical Holidays; Covenant and Mission; [[The Ten Commandments]]; Satan, Evil and Free Will;
[[Judaism]] and the Ministry of Jesus; and Human Life Created in the Image of God.

The center runs educational seminars for students and faculty of Catholic and Protestant seminaries in the United States, Canada, and Europe. It has appointed North American and European directors to coordinate relations with religious leaders on these continents.

CJCUC has established a Theological Think Tank, the Institute for Theological Inquiry (ITI),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.standardnewswire.com/news/890647512.html "CJCUC Announces the Publication of Covenant &amp; Hope"] – standardnewswire.com – 10 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; headed by Rabbi [[Eugene Korn]] and Dr. [[Robert Jenson]] of the [[Witherspoon Institute]], which consists of international scholars and theologians whose tasks are to clarify areas of Jewish and Christian theological agreement and disagreement,&lt;ref&gt;''Covenant and Hope – Christian and Jewish Reflections'' – Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co. – July 2012 – {{ISBN|978-0802867049}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as identify areas of fruitful cooperation.

The "'''conflict thesis'''" is a [[historiography|historiographical]] approach in the [[history of science]] which maintains that there is an intrinsic intellectual conflict between [[religion]] and [[science]] and that the [[relationship between religion and science]] inevitably leads to hostility; examples to support this thesis have commonly been drawn from the relations between science and religion in Western Europe. The thesis retains support among some scientists and in the public,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[File:John William Draper.jpg|right|thumb|John William Draper]]
[[File:Andrew Dickson White 1885.jpg|right|thumb|Andrew Dickson White]]
In the 1800s the relationship between science and religion became an actual formal topic of discourse, while before this no one had pitted science against religion or vice versa, though occasional interactions were expressed in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Galileo Goes To Jail and Other Myths About Science and Religion|year=2009|isbn=9780674057418|page=3|editor=Ronald Numbers}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, it was around the mid-1800s that discussion of "science and religion" first emerged because before this time, "science" still included moral and metaphysical dimensions, was not inherently linked to the [[scientific method]], and the term "scientist" did not emerge until 1834.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harrison|first1=Peter|title=The Territories of Science and Religion|date=2015|isbn=022618448X|chapter=6. Professing Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scientist [[John William Draper]] and the writer [[Andrew Dickson White]] were the most influential exponents of the conflict thesis between religion and science. Draper had been the speaker in the [[British Association]] [[1860 Oxford evolution debate|meeting of 1860]] which led to the famous confrontation between Bishop [[Samuel Wilberforce|Wilberforce]] and [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Huxley]] over [[Darwinism]], and in America "the religious controversy over biological evolution reached its most critical stages in the late 1870s".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|title= The Post-Darwinian Controversies|first= James R. |last= Moore|page= 10|publisher=|url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ppXB4mBY05AC}} quoting Schlesinger. But see also James C. Ungureanu, "A Yankee at Oxford: John William Draper at the British Association for the Advancement of Science at Oxford, 30 June 1860," ''Notes and Records: The Royal Society Journal of the History of Science '' (Dec 2015).
&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1870s Draper was invited by American science popularizer Edward Livingston Youmans to write a ''History of the Conflict between Religion and Science'' (1874), a book replying to contemporary issues in Roman Catholicism, such as the [[papal infallibility|doctrine of papal infallibility]], and mostly criticizing what he claimed to be [[anti-intellectualism]] in [[Roman Catholicism|the Catholic tradition]],&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, D (2001), ''Rebuilding the Matrix'', Lion Publishing, {{ISBN|0-7459-5116-3}} (pg. 217)&lt;/ref&gt; but also making criticisms of [[Islam]] and of [[Protestantism]].&lt;ref&gt;
"Averroes, in his old age - he died A. D. 1193 - was expelled from Spain; the religious party had triumphed over the philosophical. He was denounced as a traitor to religion.  An opposition to philosophy had been organized all over the Mussulman world. There was hardly a philosopher who was not punished." (p142) "The two rival divisions of the Christian Church - Protestant and Catholic - were thus in accord on one point: to tolerate no science except such as they considered to be agreeable to the Scriptures." (p218)
&lt;/ref&gt; Draper's preface summarises the conflict thesis:

{{quotation|The history of Science is not a mere record of  isolated discoveries; it is a narrative of the conflict of two contending powers, the expansive force of the human intellect on one side, and the compression arising from traditionary faith and human interests on the other.&lt;ref&gt;John William Draper, ''History of the Conflict Religion'', D. Appleton and Co. (1881)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1874 White published his thesis in [[s:Popular Science Monthly/Volume 8/February 1876/The Warfare of Science I|Popular Science Monthly]] and in book form as ''The Warfare of Science'':

{{quotation|In all modern history, interference with science in the supposed interest of religion, no matter how conscientious such interference may have been, has resulted in the direst evils both to religion and to science—and invariably. And, on the other hand, all untrammeled scientific investigation, no matter how dangerous to religion some of its stages may have seemed, for the time, to be, has invariably resulted in the highest good of religion and of science.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|title= The Warfare of Science|first= Andrew Dickson|last= White|year= 1876|page= 8|url= https://archive.org/details/warfareofscience00whituoft}}
&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1896, White published ''[[A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom]]'', the culmination of over thirty years of research and publication on the subject, criticizing what he saw as restrictive, dogmatic forms of [[Christianity]]. In the introduction, White emphasized that he arrived at his position after the difficulties of assisting [[Ezra Cornell]] in establishing a university without any official religious affiliation.

[[James Joseph Walsh]], M.D., the historian of medicine, criticized White's perspective as anti-historical in [https://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC22760194&amp;id=B-cQAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage&amp;dq=%22popes+and+science%22 ''The Popes and Science; the History of the Papal Relations to Science During the Middle Ages and Down to Our Own Time''] (1908),&lt;ref&gt;Fordam University Press, 1908, Kessinger Publishing, reprinted 2003. {{ISBN|0-7661-3646-9}}  Reviews: [https://books.google.com/books?vid=02tZKPD5CJrIa31EgK&amp;id=G57Y1rlQVP0C&amp;pg=PT2&amp;lpg=PT2&amp;dq=%22the+popes+and+science%22] [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1407075]&lt;/ref&gt; a book dedicated to [[Pope Pius X]]:

{{quotation|the story of the supposed opposition of the Church and the Popes and the ecclesiastical authorities to science in any of its branches, is founded entirely on mistaken notions. Most of it is quite imaginary. Much of it is due to the exaggeration of the significance of the [[Galileo affair|Galileo incident]]. Only those who know nothing  about the history of medicine and of science continue to harbor it. That Dr. White's book, contradicted as it is so directly by all serious histories of medicine and of science, should have been read by so many thousands in this country, and should have been taken seriously by educated men, physicians, teachers, and even professors of science who want to know the history of their own sciences, only shows how easily even supposedly educated men may be led to follow their prejudices rather than their mental faculties, and emphasizes the fact that the tradition that there is no good that can possibly come out of the Nazareth of the times before the reformation, still dominates the intellects of many educated people who think that they are far from prejudice and have minds perfectly open to conviction.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, James Joseph, ''The Popes and Science; the History of the Papal Relations to Science During the Middle Ages and Down to Our Own Time'', Fordam University Press, New York 1908, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''God and Nature'' (1986), [[David C. Lindberg|David Lindberg]] and [[Ronald Numbers]] report that "White's ''Warfare'' apparently did not sell as briskly as Draper's ''Conflict'', but in the end it proved more influential, partly, it seems, because Draper's strident anti-Catholicism soon dated his work and because White's impressive documentation gave the appearance of sound scholarship".&lt;ref&gt;David C. Lindberg, Ronald L. Numbers, ''God &amp; Nature: Historical Essays on the Encounter Between Christianity and Science'', University of California Press (April 29, 1986)&lt;/ref&gt; During the 20th century, historians' acceptance of the conflict thesis declined until rejected in the 1970s. David B. Wilson notes:

{{quotation|Despite the growing number of scholarly modifications and rejections of the conflict model from the 1950's ... in the 1970s leading historians of the nineteenth century still felt required to attack it. ... Whatever the reason for the continued survival of the conflict thesis, two other books on the nineteenth century that were published in the 1970s hastened its final demise among historians of science ... 1974 ...

In his course on science and religion, historian Lawrence Principe summarizes Draper's and White's works by saying, "While we can look today with astonishment upon the shoddy character of Draper and White’s writings, their books have had enormous impact, and we can’t deny that.  Much of this is due to their great success in their creating a myth for science as a religion.  Their myth of science as a religion is replete with battles, and martyrdoms, and saints, and creeds.  And as we know, or should know, myths are often much more powerful than historical realities."
&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|author=Principe, Lawrence M.|title=Science and Religion|year=2006|publisher=The Teaching Company|page=Lecture 2}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the coursebook, Principe writes, "No serious historians of science or of the science-religion issue today maintain the warfare thesis...The origins of the warfare thesis lie in the late 19th century, specifically in the work of two men - John William Draper and Andrew Dickson White.  These men had specific political purposes in mind when arguing their case, and the historical foundations of their work are unreliable."
{{cite book|author=Principe, Lawrence M.|title=Science and Religion|year=2006|publisher=The Teaching Company|page=7}}


Regarding the scholarship of Draper's work, Principe says
{{quotation|How does he [John William Draper] support his contention of conflict?  Well, unfortunately, with some of the worst historical writing you are ever likely to come across.  Historical facts are confected, causes and chronologies twisted to the author’s purpose.  We find interpretations made merely by declaration.  We find quotations violently taken out of context.  And instances, quite a few of them where Draper claims a historical writer said something in fact 180 degrees away from what he actually claimed...Much of Draper’s book is so ridiculous, so malodramatic, so rabid, it’s hard for a knowledgeable person actually to read it without a wry smirk...Let’s start with a simple and a notorious example: the idea that before Columbus people thought that the world was flat.  Well, in fact, it is Draper and White, specifically, both of them, who bear most of the blame for popularizing this baseless view to the extent that nowadays, 80 percent of school teachers still foist this upon poor innocent school children.  The fact is that of course the sphericity of the Earth was well established by the fifth century BC by the Greeks, and a good measure of its circumference made by the third century BC.  And these facts were never forgotten in learned Western Culture.
&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|author=Principe, Lawrence M.|title=Science and Religion|year=2006|publisher=The Teaching Company|page=Lecture 2}}
&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Principe's summary comment on Draper's work at the end of his coursebook reads: "The book that started the conflict myth.  Take a sense of humor and/or a stiff drink with this dated bit of melodrama."&lt;ref&gt;

==Modern views==

===Academic===

Historians of science today have moved away from a conflict model, which is based mainly on two historical episodes (those involving Galileo and Darwin) in favor of a "complexity" model, because religious figures took positions on both sides of each dispute and there was no overall aim by any party involved in discrediting religion.&lt;ref name="glory rich jones"&gt;{{cite book|last= Jones|first= Richard H.|title= For the Glory of God : The Role of Christianity in the Rise and Development of Modern Science|year= 2011|publisher= University Press of America|isbn= 9780761855668|pages= 139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biologist [[Stephen Jay Gould]] said: "White's and Draper's accounts of the actual interaction between science and religion in Western history do not differ greatly. Both tell a tale of bright progress continually sparked by science. And both develop and use the same myths to support their narrative, the [[Myth of the Flat Earth|flat-earth legend]] prominently among them".&lt;ref name=Gould1996&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a summary of the [[historiography]] of the conflict thesis, [[Colin A. Russell]], the former President of [[Christians in Science]], said that "Draper takes such liberty with history, perpetuating legends as fact that he is rightly avoided today in serious historical study. The same is nearly as true of White, though his prominent apparatus of prolific footnotes may create a misleading impression of meticulous scholarship".&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Colin A., "The Conflict of Science and Religion", ''Encyclopedia of the History of Science and Religion'', p. 15, New York 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Science &amp; Religion'', Gary Ferngren proposes a complex relationship between religion and science:

{{quotation|While some historians had always regarded the Draper-White thesis as oversimplifying and distorting a complex relationship, in the late twentieth century it underwent a more systematic reevaluation.  The result is the growing recognition among historians of science that the relationship of religion and science has been much more positive than is sometimes thought.  Although popular images of controversy continue to exemplify the supposed hostility of Christianity to new scientific theories, studies have shown that Christianity has often nurtured and encouraged scientific endeavour, while at other times the two have co-existed without either tension or attempts at harmonization.  If [[Galileo affair|Galileo]] and the [[Scopes trial]] come to mind as examples of conflict, they were the exceptions rather than the rule.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Ferngren (editor).  ''Science &amp; Religion: A Historical Introduction''.  Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2002.  {{ISBN|0-8018-7038-0}}. (Introduction, p. ix)&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Some modern historians of science (such as Peter Barker, [[Bernard R. Goldstein]], and Crosbie Smith) propose that scientific discoveries - such as [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]] in the 17th century, and the reformulation of physics in terms of [[energy]], in the 19th century - were driven by religion.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, Peter, and Goldstein, Bernard R. "Theological Foundations of Kepler's Astronomy". ''Osiris'', Volume 16: ''Science in Theistic Contexts'',  University of Chicago Press, 2001, pp. 88–113; Smith, Crosbie.  ''The Science of Energy: A Cultural History of Energy Physics in Victorian Britain''.  London: The Athlone PRess, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Religious organizations and clerics figure prominently in the broad histories of science, until the [[profession]]alization of the scientific enterprise, in the 19th century, led to tensions between scholars taking religious and secular approaches to nature.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the chapters on "Geology and Paleontology" (by Nicolaas A. Rupke), "Natural History" (by Peter M. Hess), and "Charles Darwin" (by James Moore) in Gary Ferngren (ed.), ''Science and Religion: A Historical Introduction''.&lt;/ref&gt; Even the prominent examples of religion's apparent conflict with science, the [[Galileo affair]] (1614) and the [[Scopes trial]] (1925), were not pure instances of conflict between science and religion, but included personal and political facts in the development of each conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell, Richard J., "Galileo Galilei", ''Science and Religion: A Historical Introduction''; Larson, Edward J.

{{main|Galileo affair}}
The Galileo affair is one of the few examples commonly used by advocates of the conflict thesis. Maurice Finocchiaro writes that the Galileo affair epitomizes the common view of "the conflict between enlightened science and obscurantist religion," and that this view promotes "the myth that alleges the incompatibility between science and religion." Finocchiaro writes, "I believe that such a thesis is erroneous, misleading, and simplistic," and refers to John Draper, Andrew White, Voltaire, Einstein, Bertrand Russell, and Karl Popper as writers or icons who have promoted it.&lt;ref name="Trial Galileo Essential" /&gt; Finocchiaro also describes as mythical the notion that Galileo "saw" the earth's motion, since this direct observation was only possible in the 21st century, and the idea that Galileo was "imprisoned," since he was "actually held under house arrest."&lt;ref name="Trial Galileo Essential" /&gt; He notes that the situation was complex and objections to the Copernican system included scientific, philosophical, and theological arguments.&lt;ref name="Trial Galileo Essential" /&gt;

The Galileo affair was a sequence of events, beginning around 1610,&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell ([[#Reference-Blackwell-1991|1991]], p.2). Blackwell ([[#Reference-Blackwell-1991|1991]], p.50) dates the start of the Galileo affair to 1610. Finocchiaro ([[#Reference-Finocchiaro-1989|1989]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=wKCZFJuMCaQC&amp;pg=PA1 p.1]) puts it a few years later, in 1613.&lt;/ref&gt; culminating with the trial and condemnation of [[Galileo Galilei]] by the [[Roman Inquisition|Roman Catholic Inquisition]] in 1633 for his support of [[heliocentrism]].&lt;ref&gt;Finocchiaro ([[#Reference-Finocchiaro-1989|1989]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=wKCZFJuMCaQC&amp;pg=PA1 p.1]): "By the 'Galileo affair' is meant the sequence of developments which began in 1613 and culminated with the trial and condemnation of Galileo Galilei by the Roman Catholic Inquisition in 1633."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1610, Galileo published his ''[[Sidereus Nuncius]] (Starry Messenger)'', describing the surprising observations that he had made with the new [[telescope]], namely the phases of [[Venus]] and the [[Galilean moons]] of Jupiter. With these observations he promoted the [[heliocentrism|heliocentric]] theory of [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] (published in ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' in 1543). Galileo's initial discoveries were met with opposition within the Catholic Church, and in 1616 the Inquisition declared heliocentrism to be formally heretical. Heliocentric books were banned and Galileo was ordered to refrain from holding, teaching or defending heliocentric ideas.&lt;ref name=h218&gt;Heilbron (2010), p.218&lt;/ref&gt;

Pope Urban VIII had been an admirer and supporter of Galileo, and there is evidence he did not believe the inquisition's declaration rendered heliocentrism a heresy. Urban may have rather viewed Heliocentrism as a potentially dangerous or rash doctrine that nevertheless had utility in astronomical calculations.&lt;ref name="Trial Galileo Essential"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Finocchiaro|first1=Maurice A.|title=The Trial of Galileo : Essential Documents|date=2014|isbn=1624661327|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1632 Galileo, now an old man, published his  ''[[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems]]'', which implicitly defended heliocentrism, and was popular. Pope Urban VIII had asked that his own views on the matter be included in Galileo's book, and were voiced by a character named ''Simplicio'' who was a simpleton.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Finocchiaro-1997|Finocchiaro (1997)]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Li4eh7JIMtIC&amp;pg=PA82 p. 82]; [[#Reference-Moss&amp;Wallace-2003|Moss &amp; Wallace (2003)]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Lw50esHmgacC&amp;pg=PA11 p. 11]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Langford [[#Reference-Langford-1998|(1966, pp. 133–134)]], and Seeger [[#Reference-Seeger-1966|(1966, p. 30)]], for example. Drake [[#Reference-Drake-1978|(1978, p. 355)]] asserts that Simplicio's character is modelled on the Aristotelian philosophers, Lodovico delle Colombe and [[Cesare Cremonini (philosopher)|Cesare Cremonini]], rather than on Pope Urban. He also considers that the demand for Galileo to include the Pope's argument in the ''Dialogue'' left him with no option but to put it in the mouth of Simplicio [[#Reference-Drake-1953|(Drake, 1953, p. 491)]]. Even [[Arthur Koestler]], who is generally quite harsh on Galileo in [[The Sleepwalkers (Koestler non-fiction book)|''The Sleepwalkers'']] [[#Reference-Koestler-1990|(1959)]], after noting that Urban suspected Galileo of having intended Simplicio to be a caricature of him, says "this of course is untrue" [[#Reference-Koestler-1990|(1959, p. 483)]].&lt;/ref&gt; This angered the Pope and weakened Galileo's position politically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Lindberg|first = David|title = Beyond War and Peace:  A Reappraisal of the Encounter between Christianity and Science|url = http://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/1987/PSCF9-87Lindberg.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Responding to mounting controversy over [[theology]], [[astronomy]] and [[philosophy]], the [[Roman Inquisition]] tried Galileo in 1633 and found him "vehemently suspect of [[heresy]]", sentencing him to [[indefinite imprisonment]].

===Scientist and public perceptions===

This thesis is still held to be true in whole or in part by some prominent contemporary scientists such as [[Stephen Hawking]] who has said "There is a fundamental difference between religion, which is based on authority, [and] science, which is based on observation and reason. Science will win because it works."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=HEUSSNER|first1=KI MAE|title=Stephen Hawking on Religion: 'Science Will Win'|website=ABC News|date=June 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as [[Steven Weinberg]], grant that it is possible for science and religion to be compatible since some prominent scientists are also religious, but he sees some significant tensions that potentially weaken religious beliefs overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weinberg|first1=Steven|title=Lake Views: This World and the Universe|date=2011|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|isbn=0674062302|pages=231–237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study done on scientists from 21 American universities showed that most did not perceive conflict between science and religion. In the study, the strength of religiosity in the home in which a scientist was raised, current religious attendance, peers' attitudes toward religion, all had an impact on whether or not scientists saw religion and science as in conflict. Scientists who had grown up with a religion and retained that identity or had identified as spiritual or had religious attendance tended to perceive less or no conflict. However, those not attending religious services were more likely to adopt a conflict paradigm. Additionally, scientists were more likely to reject conflict thesis if their peers held positive views of religion.&lt;ref name="scientists religion"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ecklund|first=Elaine Howard|author2=Park, Jerry Z. |title=Conflict Between Religion and Science Among Academic Scientists?|year=2009|journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|volume=48|issue=2|pages=276–292|doi=10.1111/j.1468-5906.2009.01447.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Science historian [[Ronald Numbers]] suggests the conflict theory lingers in a popular belief, inclusive of scientists and clerics alike, and that while history reflects an intrinsic and inevitable intellectual conflict between (Judeo-Christian) religion and science, it is perpetuated by the [[polemic]]s surrounding controversies involving [[creation–evolution controversy|creation–evolution]], [[stem cell controversy|stem cells]], and [[birth control]].&lt;ref name="numbers"&gt;{{cite video | people=[[Ronald Numbers]] (Lecturer) | date=May 11, 2006 | url=http://www.st-edmunds.cam.ac.uk/faraday/Lectures.php | title=Myths and Truths in Science and Religion: A historical perspective | medium=Video Lecture | location=University of Cambridge (Howard Building, Downing College) | publisher=The Faraday Institute for Science and Religion}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many religious groups have made statements regarding the compatibility of religion and science,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ncse.com/media/voices/religion|title=Statements from Religious Organizations|date=2008-09-08|work=NCSE|access-date=2018-05-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; urging, for example, "school board members to preserve the integrity of the science curriculum by affirming the teaching of the theory of evolution as a core component of human knowledge.

Research on perceptions of science among the American public concludes that most religious groups see no general epistemological conflict with science, and that they have no differences with nonreligious groups in propensity to seek out scientific knowledge, although there may be epistemic or moral conflicts when scientists make counterclaims to religious tenets.&lt;ref name="epistemic moral conflict"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Evans|first=John|title=Epistemological and Moral Conflict Between Religion and Science|journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|year=2011|volume=50|issue=4|pages=707–727|doi=10.1111/j.1468-5906.2011.01603.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baker|first=Joseph O.|journal=Public Understanding of Science|title=Public Perceptions of Incompatibility Between "Science and Religion"|year=2012|volume=21|issue=3|pages=340–353|doi=10.1177/0963662511434908}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pew Center]] made similar findings and also noted that the majority of Americans (80–90%) strongly support scientific research, agree that science makes society and individual's lives better, and 8 in 10 Americans would be happy if their children were to become scientists.&lt;ref name="Pew Public Understanding"&gt;{{cite web|title=Religious Belief and Public Attitudes About Science in the US|url=http://pewresearch.org/assets/pdf/667.pdf|publisher=Pew Research Center|author1=Scott Keeter |author2=Gregory Smith |author3=David Masci |pages=1–2, 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even strict creationists tend to express very favorable views towards science.&lt;ref name="global public science"&gt;{{cite book|last=Keeter|first=Scott|title=The Culture of science: How the Public Relates to Science Across the Globe|year=2011|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0415873697|author2=Smith, Gregory |author3=Masci, David |page=336,345–346|chapter=Religious Belief and Attitudes about Science in the United States|quote=The United States is perhaps the most religious out of the advanced industrial democracies." ; "In fact, large majorities of the traditionally religious American nevertheless hold very positive views of science and scientists.

Another finding in the study was that it is more likely for students to move from a conflict perspective to an independence or collaboration perspective than vice versa.&lt;ref name=scheitle11&gt;{{cite journal |author=Christopher P.

'''Criticism of the Seventh-day Adventist Church''' includes observations made about its teachings, structure, and practices or theological disagreements from various individuals and groups. 

==Major critics==
One of the most prominent early critics of the church was [[D. M. Canright]], an early leader in the movement in the late 19th century who apostatized and recanted but later left and became a Baptist pastor.

In the middle of the 20th century, evangelical [[Walter Ralston Martin|Walter Martin]] and the [[Christian Research Institute]] concluded that the Seventh-day Adventist church is a legitimate Christian body with some [[heterodox]] doctrines and stated, "They are sound on the great New Testament doctrines including grace and redemption through the vicarious offering of Jesus Christ 'once for all'.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ministrymagazine.org/archive/1993/June/adventists-and-evangelicals-another-viewpoint  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101008062819/http://www.ministrymagazine.org/archive/1993/June/adventists-and-evangelicals-another-viewpoint |date=October 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Walter Ralston Martin|Walter Martin]]|title=The Truth About Seventh-Day Adventism|publisher=Zondervan|year=1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other scholars such as Calvinist [[Anthony A. Hoekema]], who did not agree with the Adventist views from Arminius's as Adventism holds a Wesleyan/Arminian stream of theology, grouped Seventh-day Adventism with [[Mormonism]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and [[Christian Science]] in his book ''The Four Major Cults''.&lt;ref name="Hoekema"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Four Major Cults: Christian Science, Jehovah's Witnesses, Mormonism, Seventh-day Adventism|author=[[Anthony A. Hoekema]]|publisher=Eerdmans|year=1963|isbn=0-85364-094-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary critics include former Adventist pastor and academy teacher Dale Ratzlaff, who left the church in the 1980s and later founded Life Assurance Ministries.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.lifeassuranceministries.com/ LAM Publications, LLC].&lt;/ref&gt;

In debates regarding the [[inspiration of Ellen White]] during the 1970s, Adventists Walter T. Rea{{sfn|Rea|1983}} and [[Ronald Numbers]]{{sfn|Numbers|1976}} wrote material that some felt was critical of Ellen White.

==Church doctrine==

===Trinitarian views===
Some Christian critics of Adventism contend that the current Adventist view of the [[Trinity]] is not orthodox and/or constitutes [[Tritheism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Colleen|last1=Tinker|first2=Richard|last2=Tinker|editor=Paul Carden|title=10 Questions &amp; Answers on Seventh-day Adventism|publisher=Rose Publishing|year=2010|isbn=978-1-59636-422-6|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ratzlaff|first=Dale|title=Truth about Adventist "Truth"|publisher=LAM Publications, LLC|year=2007|isbn=0-9747679-4-8|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wiebe|first=Elmer|title=Who Is the Adventist Jesus?|publisher=Xulon Press|year=2006|isbn=1-59781-328-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Several Seventh-day Adventist scholars have acknowledged that the Adventist view of the Trinity tends to differ in some aspects from the inherited traditional Christian view of the doctrine. According to Dr. Jerry Moon{{Who|date=October 2012}}, Ellen White, the co-founder of the church, taught that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are three distinct individuals yet are united as one in the Godhead.&lt;ref&gt;From SDA Seminary professor Dr. Jerry Moon's presentation at the Adventist Theological Society’s 2006 "Trinity Symposium." http://atsjats.org/site/1/podcast/06_Trinity_Moon_Quest_Biblical_Trinity.mp3&lt;/ref&gt;

Moon asserts that Ellen White was raised trinitarian but adopted a different view from the traditional one and contends that White's later writings on the Trinity is not the same as the view rejected by the early Adventists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Critic A. Leroy Moore contends Adventists reject the orthodox view, and contends that the view probably would have been branded as Arian by the orthodox.&lt;ref&gt;SDA scholar and author A. LeRoy Moore, at the panel Q&amp;A Session at the ATS 2006 "Trinity Symposium." http://atsjats.org/site/1/podcast/06_Trinity_Participants_Panel_Discussion.mp3&lt;/ref&gt;

:"What James [SDA co-founder James White, husband of Ellen White] and the other men were opposed to, we are just as opposed to as they were. Now, their solution to that, at that time, they didn't see any solution by retaining the Trinity concept, and getting rid of its distortions. But, in reality, we have been faithful to their commitment, and I know of nothing that they were objecting to, in objecting to Trinitarianism, that we have not also objected to."&lt;ref&gt;From a Q&amp;A session at the ATS 2006 "Trinity Symposium." http://atsjats.org/site/1/podcast/06_Trinity_Burt_Historical_Adventist_Views.mp3&lt;/ref&gt; In 1876, James White discussed the differences between Seventh Day Baptists and Seventh-day Adventists, he observed, "The S. D. Adventists hold the divinity of Christ so nearly with the trinitarian, that we apprehend no trial here." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = White  | first = James  | title = The Two Bodies: the relation which the S.

:"A major development [in Adventism] since 1972 has been the quest to articulate biblical presuppositions grounding a biblical doctrine of the Trinity, clearly differentiated from the dualistic presuppositions that undergird the traditional creedal statements."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Woodrow|last1=Whidden|first2=Jerry|last2=Moon|first3=John W.|last3=Reeve|title=The Trinity: Understanding God's Love, His Plan of Salvation, and Christian Relationships|publisher=Review and Herald Publishing Association|year=2002|isbn=0-8280-1684-4|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"In many ways the philosophical assumptions and presuppositions of our worldview are different from traditional Christianity and bring different perspectives on some of these old issues. We do not accept the traditional Platonic dualistic worldview and metaphysics that were foundational to the church fathers' theology of the Trinity, one of these being the concept of the immortality of the soul."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Christology===
It has been alleged by the [[Christian Research Institute]] that Adventism teaches that Christ ''had'' a sinful nature.&lt;ref&gt;(''Christian Research Journal'', Summer 1988, p.&amp;nbsp;13)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://greatcontroversy.org/gco/ser/kirl-halfadam.php Half Adam?] a sermon by [[Larry Kirkpatrick]]&lt;/ref&gt; Adventists hold that Christ came as fully man and yet still fully divine, and covering the nature of Christ  state that Jesus Christ inherited Adam's fallen nature that has been passed on to all of humanity but did not sin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amazingfacts.org/FreeStuff/OnlineLibrary/tabid/106/ctl/ViewMedia/mid/447/IID/87/LNG/en/SC/R/Default.aspx?7=Christ%27s-Human-Nature Christ's Human Nature] by Joe Crews&lt;/ref&gt; Such a belief is based on the following texts:

:"For what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh, God did by sending His own Son '''in the likeness of sinful flesh''', on account of sin: He condemned sin in the flesh" (Romans 8:3 NKJV)

:"For we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but was '''in all points tempted as we are''', yet without sin." (Hebrews 4:15 NKJV)

:"...concerning his Son (Jesus), who was descended from David ''according to the flesh''..." (Romans 1:3 ESV)

:"Therefore, ''in all things'' He had to be made like His brethren, that He might be a merciful and faithful High Priest in things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people." (Hebrews 2:17 NKJV)

Adventist doctrine is that God took "man's nature in its fallen condition," but yet "Christ did not in the least participate in its sin", which shows Christ with post fall humanity but a sinlessness of Adam before the fall&lt;ref name="The"&gt;The SDA Bible Commentary, vol.5, p.1131.&lt;/ref&gt; Mainstream Adventists believe that Jesus was beset with all of the moral weaknesses and frailties that ordinary humans experience. However, he did not have the propensity to sin. Christ could be tested by temptation, but like Adam before the fall, did not have the ungodly desires or sinful inclinations of humanity.&lt;ref name="The" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sdanet.org/atissue/books/wwhc/&lt;/ref&gt; Ellen White states "The Lord Jesus came to our world, not to reveal what a God could do, but what a man could do, through faith in God’s power to help in every emergency. Man is, through faith, to be a partaker in the divine nature, and to overcome every temptation wherewith he is beset."&lt;ref name="Ellen G. White p. 929"&gt;[Ellen G. White, 7BC p. 929 par. 6]&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this, he managed to resist temptation both from within and without, and lived a perfectly obedient life. Jesus is therefore set forth as the supreme Example in whose footsteps Christians must follow. The fact that he overcame sin completely, despite having no advantage over other human beings, demonstrates that we too can live a life of complete obedience by trusting in him.  [[Ellen White]] states "The Lord Jesus came to our world, not to reveal what a God could do, but what a man could do, through faith in God’s power to help in every emergency. Man is, through faith, to be a partaker in the divine nature, and to overcome every temptation wherewith he is beset."&lt;ref name="Ellen G. White p. 929"/&gt;

Adventists are firm believers that people are [[Sola fide|saved by faith and not through works]], however works are the necessary fruits that are proof of God truly being given a place in our lives.

And:
{{Quotation|"Notwithstanding that the sins of a guilty world were laid upon Christ, notwithstanding the humiliation of taking upon Himself '''our fallen nature''', the voice from heaven declared Him to be the Son of the Eternal" | [[Ellen White]], ''The Desire of Ages'', p. 112.}}

===Investigative judgment and salvation===
The ''[[Investigative Judgment]]'' doctrine is defined in the Church's list of fundamental beliefs.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.adventist.org/beliefs/fundamental/
| title = Fundamental Beliefs
| publisher = General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists
| accessdate = 2006-06-06
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reviewing this uniquely Seventh-day Adventist doctrine, non-Adventist critics contend that it is not Biblical teaching.

Adventists answer that the ''Investigative Judgment'' doctrine is not about celestial geography, that a judgment of works is compatible with the gospel, and that Scriptures like {{Bibleverse|1|Peter|4:17}} and {{Bibleverse||Matthew|25}} teach an end-time judgment of the Church. They believe that the "end time gospel" of {{Bibleverse||Revelation|14:6-12}} did not sound in the first century but applies to our time. Also, many Adventist scholars interpret the references in Hebrews as to do with inauguration of the heavenly sanctuary, taking {{Bibleverse||Hebrews|6:19-20|HCSB}} as parallel to {{Bibleverse||Hebrews|10:19-20|HCSB}}, a view shared with certain biblical scholars of other faiths,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| author = Paul Ellingworth
| year = 1993
| title = The Epistle to the Hebrews ([[New International Greek Testament Commentary|NIGTC]])
| page= 518}}
&lt;/ref&gt; instead of the Day of Atonement event as interpreted by critics.

The essence of Old Testament sanctuary typology that Adventists rely on for their eschatology may be summarized as follows:

: The sanctuary services emphasized three aspects of Christ’s work for us: sacrifice, mediation, and judgment.

As to the 1844 date, Walter Martin wrote:

: Lest anyone reading the various accounts of the rise of "Millerism" in the United States come to the conclusion that Miller and his followers were "crackpots" or "uneducated tools of Satan," the following facts should be known: The Great Advent Awakening movement that spanned the Atlantic from Europe was bolstered by a tremendous wave of contemporary biblical scholarship. Although Miller himself lacked academic theological training, actually scores of prophetic scholars in Europe and the United States had espoused Miller's views before he himself announced them. In reality, his was only one more voice proclaiming the 1843/1844 fulfilment of {{Bibleverse||Daniel|8:14}}, or the 2300-year period allegedly dating from 457 B.C. and ending in A.D. 1843-1844.&lt;ref name="Martin2"&gt;{{cite book

===Catholicism In Eschatology===
{{See also|Antichrist (historicism)|Seventh-day Adventist eschatology}}
Like the Protestant Reformers, some writings of Ellen White speak against the [[Catholic Church]] in preparation for a nefarious eschatological role as the antagonist against God's remnant church (the Seventh-day Adventist Church) and that the papacy is the beast that emerges from the sea (Ap 13).  Many Protestant reformers such as [[Martin Luther]], [[John Knox]], [[William Tyndale]] and others held similar beliefs about the Catholic Church and the papacy when they broke away from the Catholic Church during the reformation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehorsemedia.com/articles/?d=44 The Antichrist and the Protestant Reformation]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''definition of religion''' is a controversial subject in [[religious studies]] with scholars failing to agree on any one definition. [[Oxford Dictionary]] defines [[religion]] as the belief in and worship of a superhuman controlling power, especially a [[personal God]] or gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/religion|title=religion (English Oxford living Dictionaries)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others such as [[Wilfred Cantwell Smith]], have tried to correct a perceived Judeo-Christian and Western bias in the definition and study of religion. Thinkers such as Daniel Dubuisson{{sfn|Dubuisson|2007}} have doubted that the term religion has any meaning outside of western cultures, while others, such as Ernst Feil{{sfn|Feil|2000}} even doubt that it has any specific, universal meaning even there.

==Competing definitions==

Scholars have failed to agree on a definition of religion. There are however two general definition systems: the sociological/functional and the phenomenological/philosophical.&lt;ref&gt;Vgl. Johann Figl: ''Handbuch Religionswissenschaft: Religionen und ihre zentralen Themen.'' Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 2003, {{ISBN|3-7022-2508-0}}, S. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Julia Haslinger: ''Die Evolution der Religionen und der Religiosität,'' s.

* [[Emile Durkheim]] defined religion as "a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things, that is to say things set apart and forbidden - beliefs and practises which unite into one single moral community called a church, all those who adhere to them."{{sfn|Taves|2009|page=176}}
* [[Max Lynn Stackhouse]], defined religion as "a comprehensive worldview or 'metaphysical moral vision' that is accepted as binding because it is held to be in itself basically true and just even if all dimensions of it cannot be either fully confirmed or refuted".{{sfn|Nelson|2010|page=xi}}

Some jurisdictions refuse to classify specific religions as religions, arguing that they are instead heresies, even if they are widely viewed as a religion in the academic world.{{sfn|Minahan|2002|page=234}}

===Modern western===
Religion is  a [[modern era|modern]] [[Western culture|Western]] concept.&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald"&gt;{{Cite book|ref=harv|first=Timothy|last=Fitzgerald|title=Discourse on Civility and Barbarity|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2007|pages=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parallel concepts are not found in many current and past cultures; there is no equivalent term for religion in many languages.&lt;ref name="50 great"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morreall|first1=John|last2=Sonn|first2=Tamara|title=50 Great Myths about Religions|date=2013|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=9780470673508|pages=12–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nongbri&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nongbri |first1=Brent |title=Before Religion: A History of a Modern Concept |date=2013 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=030015416X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have found it difficult to develop a consistent definition, with some giving up on the possibility of a definition.&lt;ref&gt;McKinnon, AM.  2002).  [http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/3073/1/McKinnon_Definition_of_Religion_author_version_no_format.pdf "Sociological Definitions, Language Games and the 'Essence' of Religion"]. ''Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion'', vol 14, no. 1, pp. 61–83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Josephson, Jason Ānanda. (2012) ''The Invention of Religion in Japan.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that regardless of its definition, it is not appropriate to apply it to non-Western cultures.&lt;ref name=dubuisson&gt;{{cite book|first1=Daniel|last1=Dubuisson|title=The Western Construction of Religion : Myths, Knowledge, and Ideology|date=2007|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore, Md.|isbn=0801887569}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald"/&gt;

An increasing number of scholars have expressed reservations about ever defining the essence of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=McKinnon | first=A. M. |date=2002 |title=Sociological definitions, language games, and the 'essence' of religion | journal=Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion | publisher=Brill Academic Publishers | volume=14 | issue=1 | issn=0943-3058 | doi=10.1163/157006802760198776 | pages=61–83 |url=http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/3073/1/McKinnon_Definition_of_Religion_author_version_no_format.pdf |access-date=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They observe that the way we use the concept today is a particularly modern construct that would not have been understood through much of history and in many cultures outside the West (or even in the West until after the [[Peace of Westphalia]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Wilfred Cantwell |date=1978 |title=The Meaning and End of Religion |location=New York |publisher=Harper and Row}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MacMillan Encyclopedia of Religions states:
{{quote|The very attempt to define religion, to find some distinctive or possibly unique essence or set of qualities that distinguish the religious from the remainder of human life, is primarily a Western concern. The attempt is a natural consequence of the Western speculative, intellectualistic, and scientific disposition. It is also the product of the dominant Western religious mode, what is called the Judeo-Christian climate or, more accurately, the theistic inheritance from Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The theistic form of belief in this tradition, even when downgraded culturally, is formative of the dichotomous Western view of religion. That is, the basic structure of theism is essentially a distinction between a transcendent deity and all else, between the creator and his creation, between God and man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=King |first=W.L. |date=2005 |article=Religion (First Edition) |editor-link=Mircea Eliade |editor-first=Mircea |editor-last=Eliade |title=The Encyclopedia of Religion |publisher=[[Gale (publisher)|MacMillan Reference USA]] |edition=2nd |p=7692}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The anthropologist [[Clifford Geertz]] defined religion as a
{{quote|[…] system of symbols which acts to establish powerful, pervasive, and long-lasting moods and motivations in men by formulating conceptions of a general order of existence and clothing these conceptions with such an aura of factuality that the moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic."{{sfn|Geertz|1993|pp=87–125}}}}

Alluding perhaps to Tylor's "deeper motive", Geertz remarked that
{{quote|[…] we have very little idea of how, in empirical terms, this particular miracle is accomplished. We just know that it is done, annually, weekly, daily, for some people almost hourly; and we have an enormous ethnographic literature to demonstrate it.{{sfn|Geertz|1993|p=90}}}}

The theologian [[Antoine Vergote]] took the term supernatural simply to mean whatever transcends the powers of nature or human agency. He also emphasized the cultural reality of religion, which he defined as
{{quote|[…] the entirety of the linguistic expressions, emotions and, actions and signs that refer to a supernatural being or supernatural beings.&lt;ref name="vergote"&gt;Vergote, A. (1996) ''Religion, Belief and Unbelief. A Psychological Study'', Leuven University Press. (p. 16)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Peter Mandaville]] and [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] intended to get away from the modernist dualisms or dichotomous understandings of immanence/transcendence, spirituality/materialism, and sacredness/secularity. They define religion as
{{quote|[…] a relatively-bounded system of beliefs, symbols and practices that addresses the nature of existence, and in which communion with others and Otherness is ''lived'' as if it both takes in and spiritually transcends socially-grounded ontologies of time, space, embodiment and knowing.&lt;ref name="Paul James and Peter Mandaville 2010"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=James |first1=Paul |last2=Mandaville |first2=Peter |year=2010 |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Globalization and Culture, Vol. 2: Globalizing Religions |url=https://www.academia.edu/4416072/Globalization_and_Culture_Vol._2_Globalizing_Religions_editor_with_Peter_Mandaville_Sage_Publications_London_2010 |publisher=Sage Publications |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to the MacMillan Encyclopedia of Religions, there is an experiential aspect to religion which can be found in almost every culture:
{{quote|[…] almost every known culture [has] a depth dimension in cultural experiences […] toward some sort of ultimacy and transcendence that will provide norms and power for the rest of life. When more or less distinct patterns of behavior are built around this depth dimension in a culture, this structure constitutes religion in its historically recognizable form. Religion is the organization of life around the depth dimensions of experience—varied in form, completeness, and clarity in accordance with the environing culture.&lt;ref&gt;MacMillan Encyclopedia of religions, ''Religion'', p. 7695&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Classical===
[[File:Будажап Цыреторов.JPG|thumb|Budazhap Shiretorov (Будажап Цыреторов), the head shaman of the religious community Altan Serge (Алтан Сэргэ) in [[Buryatia]].]]
[[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] in the late 18th century defined religion as ''das schlechthinnige Abhängigkeitsgefühl'', commonly translated as "the feeling of absolute dependence".&lt;ref&gt;Hueston A. Finlay. "'Feeling of absolute dependence' or 'absolute feeling of dependence'? A question revisited". ''Religious Studies'' 41.1 (2005), pp. 81–94. {{doi|10.1017/S0034412504007462}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His contemporary [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] disagreed thoroughly, defining religion as "the Divine Spirit becoming conscious of Himself through the finite spirit."&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Müller]]. "Lectures on the origin and growth of religion."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Burnett Tylor]] defined religion in 1871 as "the belief in spiritual beings".&lt;ref name="archive.org"&gt;Tylor, E.B. (1871) ''[https://archive.org/stream/primitiveculture1tylouoft#page/424/mode/2up Primitive Culture: Researches Into the Development of Mythology, Philosophy, Religion, Art, and Custom. Vol. 1]''. London: John Murray; (p. 424).&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that narrowing the definition to mean the belief in a supreme deity or judgment after death or [[idolatry]] and so on, would exclude many peoples from the category of religious, and thus "has the fault of identifying religion rather with particular developments than with the deeper motive which underlies them". He also argued that the belief in spiritual beings exists in all known societies.

In his book ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]'', the psychologist [[William James]] defined religion as "the feelings, acts, and experiences of individual men in their solitude, so far as they apprehend themselves to stand in relation to whatever they may consider the divine".{{sfn|James|1902|p=31}} By the term divine James meant "any object that is god''like'', whether it be a concrete deity or not"{{sfn|James|1902|p=34}} to which the individual feels impelled to respond with solemnity and gravity.{{sfn|James|1902|p=38}}

The sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]], in his seminal book ''[[The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life]]'', defined religion as a "unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things".{{sfn|Durkheim|1915|p=}} By sacred things he meant things "set apart and forbidden—beliefs and practices which unite into one single moral community called a Church, all those who adhere to them". Sacred things are not, however, limited to gods or spirits.&lt;ref group=note&gt;That is how, according to Durkheim, Buddhism is a religion. "In default of gods, Buddhism admits the existence of sacred things, namely, the [[Four Noble Truths|four noble truths]] and the practices derived from them"{{harvnb|Durkheim|1915|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the contrary, a sacred thing can be "a rock, a tree, a spring, a pebble, a piece of wood, a house, in a word, anything can be sacred".{{sfn|Durkheim|1915|p=37}} Religious beliefs, myths, dogmas and legends are the representations that express the nature of these sacred things, and the virtues and powers which are attributed to them.{{sfn|Durkheim|1915|pp=40–41}}

Echoes of James' and Durkheim's definitions are to be found in the writings of, for example, [[Frederick Ferré]] who defined religion as "one's way of valuing most comprehensively and intensively".&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Ferré, F. (1967) ''Basic modern philosophy of religion''. Scribner, (p. 82).&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, for the theologian [[Paul Tillich]], faith is "the state of being ultimately concerned",&lt;ref name="Tillich, P. 1957 p.1"&gt;Tillich, P. (1957) ''Dynamics of faith''. Harper Perennial; (p. 1).&lt;/ref&gt; which "is itself religion. Religion is the substance, the ground, and the depth of man's spiritual life."&lt;ref&gt;Tillich, P. (1959) ''Theology of Culture''. Oxford University Press; (p. 8).&lt;/ref&gt;

When religion is seen in terms of sacred, divine, intensive valuing, or ultimate concern, then it is possible to understand why scientific findings and philosophical criticisms (e.g., those made by [[Richard Dawkins]]) do not necessarily disturb its adherents.&lt;ref&gt;Pecorino, P.A. (2001) [http://www2.sunysuffolk.edu/pecorip/scccweb/etexts/phil_of_religion_text/CHAPTER_10_DEFINITION/The-Definition-of-Religion.htm ''Philosophy of Religion.

==Religion as modern western construct==
[[File:Huxisanxiaotu.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]], and [[Buddhism]] are one'', a painting in the ''litang style'' portraying three men laughing by a river stream, 12th century, [[Song dynasty]]]]

A number of scholars have pointed out that the terminology used in the study of religion in the west derives from [[Judeo-Christian tradition]], and that the basic assumptions of religion as an analytical category are all Western in origin. This idea was first raised by Wilfred Cantwell Smith in his 1962 book, ''The Meaning and End of Religion''.{{sfn|Smith|1991}} Among the main proponents of this theory of religion are Daniel Dubuisson, Timothy Fitzgerald, [[Talal Asad]], and Jason Ānanda Josephson. These [[social constructionist]]s argue that religion is a modern concept that developed from Christianity and was then applied inappropriately to non-Western cultures.

While few would dispute that the concept of religion does have a historical genealogy, there is some disagreement about what the Western origin of the term has meant historically. Some such as [[Tomoko Masuzawa]] have felt that the equation of religion with Christianity had the effect of diminishing other traditions, especially in the study of comparative religions as it developed during the high point of Western imperialism.{{sfn|Masuzawa|2005}} Others{{who|date=November 2017}} have felt that this sort of criticism overestimates the influence that Western academic thought had on the rest of the world.

Daniel Dubuisson, a French anthropologist, argues that the idea of religion has changed a lot over time and that one cannot fully understand its development by relying on consistent use of the term, which "tends to minimize or cancel out the role of history".{{sfn|Dubuisson|2003}} "What the West and the history of religions in its wake have objectified under the name 'religion' is ... something quite unique, which could be appropriate only to itself and its own history."{{sfn|Dubuisson|2003}} He notes that [[St. Augustine]]'s definition of ''religio'' differed from the way we used the modern word religion.{{sfn|Dubuisson|2003}}

Dubuisson prefers the term "cosmographic formation" to religion. Dubuisson says that, with the emergence of religion as a category separate from culture and society, there arose [[religious studies]]. The initial purpose of religious studies was to demonstrate the superiority of the living or universal European world view to the dead or ethnic religions scattered throughout the rest of the world, expanding the teleological project of [[Schleiermacher]] and [[Cornelis Petrus Tiele|Tiele]] to a worldwide ideal religiousness.{{sfn|Dubuisson|2007|p=792}} Due to shifting theological currents, this was eventually supplanted by a liberal-ecumenical interest in searching for Western-style universal truths in every cultural tradition.{{sfn|Masuzawa|2005}}

According to Fitzgerald, religion is not a universal feature of all cultures, but rather a particular idea that first developed in Europe under the influence of [[Christianity]].{{sfn|Fitzgerald|2007|p=45–46}} Fitzgerald argues that from about the 4th century CE Western Europe and the rest of the world diverged. As Christianity became commonplace, the [[charismatic authority]] identified by Augustine, a quality we might today call religiousness, exerted a commanding influence at the local level. As the Catholic Church lost its dominance during the [[Protestant Reformation]] and Christianity became closely tied to political structures, religion was recast as the basis of national [[sovereignty]], and religious identity gradually became a less universal sense of spirituality and more divisive, locally defined, and tied to nationality.{{sfn|Fitzgerald|2007|page=194}} It was at this point that religion was dissociated from universal beliefs and moved closer to [[dogma]] in both meaning and practice. However, there was not yet the idea of dogma as a personal choice, only of [[established church]]es. With the Enlightenment religion lost its attachment to nationality, says Fitzgerald, but rather than becoming a universal social attitude, it now became a personal feeling or emotion.{{sfn|Fitzgerald|2007|page=268}}

[[Talal Asad]] later refined this notion by showing that many assumptions about religion derive specifically from post-Enlightenment Christianity.{{sfn|Asad|2003}}
Asad argues that before the word religion came into common usage, Christianity was a ''disciplina'', a rule just like that of the Roman Empire. This idea can be found in the writings of [[St. Augustine]] (354–430). Christianity was then a power structure opposing and superseding human institutions, a literal Kingdom of Heaven. It was the discipline taught by one's family, school, church, and city authorities, rather than something calling one to self-discipline through symbols.{{sfn|Asad|1993|p=34-35}}

These ideas are developed by [[S. N. Balagangadhara]]. In the [[Age of Enlightenment]], Balagangadhara argues that the idea of Christianity as the purest expression of spirituality was supplanted by the concept of religion as a worldwide practice.{{sfn|Balagangadhara|1994|p=159}} This caused such ideas as [[religious freedom]], a reexamination of classical [[philosophy]] as an alternative to Christian thought, and more radically [[Deism]] among intellectuals such as [[Voltaire]]. Much like Christianity, the idea of religious freedom was exported around the world as a civilizing technique, even to regions such as [[India]] that had never treated spirituality as a matter of political identity.{{sfn|Pennington|2005}}

More recently, in ''The Invention of Religion in Japan'', Josephson has argued that while the concept of religion was Christian in its early formulation, non-Europeans (such as the Japanese) did not just acquiesce and passively accept the term's meaning. Instead they worked to interpret religion (and its boundaries) strategically to meet their own agendas and staged these new meanings for a global audience.{{sfn|Josephson|2012}} In nineteenth century [[Japan]], [[Buddhism in Japan|Buddhism]] was radically transformed from a pre-modern philosophy of [[natural law]] into a religion, as Japanese leaders worked to address domestic and international political concerns. In summary, Josephson argues that the European encounter with other cultures has led to a partial de-Christianization of the category religion. Hence religion has come to refer to a confused collection of traditions with no possible coherent definition.{{sfn|Josephson|2012|p=257}}

[[George Lindbeck]], a [[Lutheran]] and a [[Postliberal theology|postliberal theologian]] (but not a social constructionist), says that religion does not refer to belief in [[God]] or a transcendent Absolute, but rather to "a kind of cultural and/or linguistic framework or medium that shapes the entirety of life and thought ... it is similar to an idiom that makes possible the description of realities, the formulation of beliefs, and the experiencing of inner attitudes, feelings, and sentiments."{{sfn|Lindbeck|1984|p=33}}

{{Other uses|Dualism (disambiguation)}}
{{God}}
'''Dualism in cosmology''' is the moral or spiritual belief that two fundamental concepts exist, which often oppose each other. It is an umbrella term that covers a diversity of views from various religions, including both traditional religions and scriptural religions.

Moral dualism is the belief of the great complement of, or conflict between, the benevolent and the malevolent. It simply implies that there are two moral opposites at work, independent of any interpretation of what might be "moral" and independent of how these may be represented. Moral opposites might, for example, exist in a worldview which has one god, more than one god, or none. By contrast, duotheism, bitheism or ditheism implies (at least) two gods. While bitheism implies harmony, ditheism implies rivalry and opposition, such as between good and evil, or light and dark, or summer and winter. For example, a ditheistic system could be one in which one god is a creator, and the other a destroyer. In [[theology]], dualism can also refer to the relationship between God and creation or God and the universe (see theistic dualism). This form of dualism is a belief shared in certain traditions of [[Christianity]] and [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref name="Rouner"/&gt; Alternatively, in ontological dualism, the world is divided into two overarching categories. The opposition and combination of the universe's two basic principles of [[yin and yang]] is a large part of Chinese philosophy, and is an important feature of [[Taoism]]. It is also discussed in [[Confucianism]].

Many [[Mythology|myths]] and creation [[Motif (narrative)|motifs]] with dualistic cosmologies have been described in [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] and [[Cultural anthropology|anthropological]] literature. These motifs conceive the world as being created, organized, or influenced by two [[demiurge]]s, [[culture hero]]es, or other mythological beings, who either compete with each other or have a complementary function in creating, arranging or influencing the world. There is a huge diversity of such cosmologies. In some cases, such as among the [[Chukchi people|Chukchi]], the beings collaborate rather than competing, and contribute to the creation in a coequal way. In many other instances the two beings are not of the same importance or power (sometimes, one of them is even characterized as gullible). Sometimes they can be contrasted as good versus evil.&lt;ref&gt;Zolotarjov 1980: 42&lt;/ref&gt; They may be often [[Twin (mythology)|believed to be twins]] or at least brothers.&lt;ref&gt;Zolotarjov 1980: 43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gusinde 1966: 71, 181&lt;/ref&gt; Dualistic motifs in mythologies can be observed in all inhabited continents. Zolotaryov concludes that they cannot be explained by [[Diffusion (anthropology)|diffusion]] or borrowing, but are rather of convergent origin: they are related to a dualistic organization of society ([[Kinship#Lineages, clans, phratries, moieties, and matrimonial sides|moieties]]); in some cultures, this social organization may have ceased to exist, but mythology preserves the memory in more and more disguised ways.&lt;ref&gt;Zolotarjov 1980: 54&lt;/ref&gt;

==Moral dualism==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
Moral dualism is the belief of the great complement or conflict between the benevolent and the malevolent. Like ditheism/bitheism (see below), moral dualism does not imply the absence of [[Monism|monist]] or [[Monotheism|monotheistic]] principles. Moral dualism simply implies that there are two moral opposites at work, independent of any interpretation of what might be "moral" and—unlike ditheism/bitheism—independent of how these may be represented.

For example, Mazdaism (Mazdean [[Zoroastrianism]]) is both dualistic and monotheistic (but not monist by definition) since in that philosophy God—the Creator—is purely good, and the [[antithesis]]&lt;!-- Mazdaism's core tenet is truth/[[asha]] vs falsehood. --&gt;—which is also uncreated–is an absolute one. [[Zurvanism]] (Zurvanite Zoroastrianism), [[Manichaeism]], and [[Mandaeism]] are representative of dualistic ''and'' [[monism|monist]] philosophies since each has a supreme and transcendental First Principle from which the two equal-but-opposite entities then emanate. This is also true for the lesser-known Christian [[Gnosticism|gnostic]] religions, such as [[Bogomilism|Bogomils]], [[Catharism]], and so on. More complex forms of monist dualism also exist, for instance in [[Hermeticism]], where ''[[Nous]]'' "thought"—that is described to have created man—brings forth both good and evil, dependent on interpretation, whether it receives prompting from the God or from the Demon. Duality with [[Pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]] is considered a logical fallacy.

===History===
Moral dualism began as a theological belief. Dualism was first seen implicitly in Egyptian religious beliefs by the contrast of the gods [[Set (deity)|Set]] (disorder, death) and [[Osiris]] (order, life).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/172631/dualism/38186/Egypt-and-Mesopotamia "Egypt and Mesopotamia"]&lt;/ref&gt; The first explicit conception of dualism came from the Ancient Persian religion of [[Zoroastrianism]] around the mid-fifth century BC. Zoroastrianism is a monotheistic religion that believes that [[Ahura Mazda]] is the eternal creator of all good things. Any violations of Ahura Mazda's order arise from ''[[druj]]'', which is everything uncreated. From this comes a significant choice for humans to make. Either they fully participate in human life for Ahura Mazda or they do not and give ''druj'' power. Personal dualism is even more distinct in the [[good and evil|beliefs]] of later religions.

The religious dualism of [[Christianity]] between good and evil is not a perfect dualism as God (good) will inevitably destroy [[Satan]] (evil). Early Christian dualism is largely based on Platonic Dualism (See: [[Neoplatonism and Christianity]]). There is also a personal dualism in Christianity with a soul-body distinction based on the idea of an immaterial Christian [[soul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Knight | first = Kevin | title = Soul | encyclopedia = Catholic Encyclopedia | edition = Online | url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm | accessdate = 13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Duotheism, bitheism, ditheism==
When used with regards to multiple gods, ''dualism'' may refer to duotheism, bitheism, or ditheism. Although ditheism/bitheism imply moral dualism, they are not equivalent: ditheism/bitheism implies (at least) two gods, while moral dualism does not necessarily imply ''[[theism]]'' ([[god (word)|theos = god]]) at all.

Both bitheism and ditheism imply a belief in two equally powerful gods with complementary or antonymous properties; however, while bitheism implies harmony, ditheism implies rivalry and opposition, such as between good and evil, bright and dark, or summer and winter. For example, a ditheistic system would be one in which one god is creative, the other is destructive (cf. [[theodicy]]). In the original conception of [[Zoroastrianism]], for example, [[Ahura Mazda]] was the spirit of ultimate good, while Ahriman ([[Angra Mainyu]]) was the spirit of ultimate evil.

In a bitheistic system, by contrast, where the two deities are not in conflict or opposition, one could be male and the other female (cf. duotheism{{clarify|reason=where would one go to [[Cf.|confer]]?|date=December 2016}}). One well-known example of a bitheistic or duotheistic theology based on gender polarity is found in the [[Neopaganism|neopagan]] religion of [[Wicca]]. In Wicca, dualism is represented in the belief of a god and a goddess as a dual partnership in ruling the universe. This is centered on the worship of a [[Wiccan views of divinity|divine couple]], the [[Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)|Moon Goddess]] and the [[Horned God]], who are regarded as lovers. However, there is also a ditheistic theme within traditional Wicca, as the Horned God has dual aspects of bright and dark - relating to day/night, summer/winter - expressed as the Oak King and the Holly King, who in Wiccan myth and ritual are said to engage in battle twice a year for the hand of the Goddess, resulting in the changing seasons. (Within Wicca, bright and dark do not correspond to notions of "good" and "evil" but are aspects of the natural world, much like [[yin and yang]] in [[Taoism]].)

===Radical and mitigated dualism===
* '''Radical Dualism''' – or absolute Dualism which posits two co-equal divine forces. [[Manichaeism]] conceives of two previously coexistent realms of light and darkness which become embroiled in conflict, owing to the chaotic actions of the latter. Subsequently, certain elements of the light became entrapped within darkness; the purpose of material creation is to enact the slow process of extraction of these individual elements, at the end of which the kingdom of light will prevail over darkness. Manicheanism likely inherits this dualistic mythology from [[Zoroastrianism]], in which the eternal spirit [[Ahura Mazda]] is opposed by his antithesis, [[Angra Mainyu]]; the two are engaged in a cosmic struggle, the conclusion of which will likewise see Ahura Mazda triumphant. '[[The Hymn of the Pearl]]' included the belief that the material world corresponds to some sort of malevolent intoxication brought about by the powers of darkness to keep elements of the light trapped inside it in a state of drunken distraction.
* '''Mitigated Dualism''' – is where one of the two principles is in some way inferior to the other. Such classical Gnostic movements as the Sethians conceived of the material world as being created by a lesser divinity than the true God that was the object of their devotion. The spiritual world is conceived of as being radically different from the material world, co-extensive with the true God, and the true home of certain enlightened members of humanity; thus, these systems were expressive of a feeling of acute alienation within the world, and their resultant aim was to allow the soul to escape the constraints presented by the physical realm.

However, bitheistic and ditheistic principles are not always so easily contrastable, for instance in a system where one god is the representative of summer and drought and the other of winter and rain/fertility (cf. the mythology of [[Persephone]]). [[Marcionism]], an early Christian sect, held that the Old and New Testaments were the work of two opposing gods: both were First Principles, but of different religions.&lt;ref&gt;Enrico Riparelli, ''Il volto del Cristo dualista. Da Marcione ai catari'', Peter Lang, Bern - Berlin - Bruxelles - Frankfurt am Main - New York - Oxford - Wien 2008, 368 pp.  {{ISBN|978-3-03911-490-0}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theistic dualism ==
In theology, dualism can refer to the relationship between God and creation or God and the universe. This form of dualism is a belief shared in certain traditions of Christianity and Hinduism.&lt;ref name="Rouner"/&gt;

===In Christianity===
[[Image:Cathars expelled.JPG|thumb|right|The Cathars being expelled from [[Carcassonne]] in 1209. The Cathars were denounced as heretics by the Roman Catholic Church for their dualist beliefs.]]
The dualism between God and Creation has existed as a central belief in multiple historical sects and traditions of Christianity, including [[Marcionism]], [[Catharism]], [[Paulicianism]], and [[Gnosticism|Gnostic Christianity]]. Christian dualism refers to the belief that God and creation are distinct, but interrelated through an indivisible bond.&lt;ref name="Rouner"/&gt; In sects like the Cathars and the Paulicians, this is a dualism between the material world, created by an evil god, and a moral god. Historians divide Christian dualism into absolute dualism, which held that the good and evil gods were equally powerful, and mitigated dualism, which held that material evil was subordinate to the spiritual good.&lt;ref name="Peters"&gt;{{cite book|last=Peters|first=Edward|title=Heresy and Authority in Medieval Europe|year=2011|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=978-0-8122-0680-7|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; The belief, by Christian theologians who adhere to a libertarian or compatibilist view of free will, that [[Free will in theology|free will]] separates humankind from God has also been characterized as a form of dualism.&lt;ref name="Rouner"/&gt; The theologian Leroy Stephens Rouner compares the dualism of Christianity with the dualism that exists in Zoroastrianism and the [[Samkhya]] tradition of Hinduism. The theological use of the word dualism dates back to 1700, in a book that describes the dualism between good and evil.&lt;ref name="Rouner"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rouner|first=Leroy|title=The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Theology|year=1983|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-0-664-22748-7|page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tolerance of dualism ranges widely among the different Christian traditions. As a monotheistic religion, the conflict between dualism and monism has existed in Christianity since its inception.&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Jeffrey|title=A History of Heaven: The Singing Silence|year=1998|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-00684-0|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1912 ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' describes that, in the Catholic Church, "the dualistic hypothesis of an eternal world existing side by side with God was of course rejected" by the thirteenth century, but [[mind–body dualism]] was not.&lt;ref name="Catholic Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Catholic Encyclopedia: An International Work of Reference on the Constitution, Doctrine, Discipline, and History of the Catholic Church|year=1912|publisher=Robert Appleton Company|page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[problem of evil]] is difficult to reconcile with absolute monism, and has prompted some Christian sects to veer towards dualism. Gnostic forms of Christianity were more dualistic, and some Gnostic traditions posited that the Devil was separate from God as an independent deity.&lt;ref name="Russell"/&gt; The Christian dualists of the Byzantine Empire, the [[Paulicianism|Paulicians]], were seen as Manichean heretics by Byzantine theologians. This tradition of Christian dualism, founded by [[Constantine-Silvanus]], argued that the universe was created through evil and separate from a moral God.&lt;ref name="Hamilton"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hamilton|first1=Janet |last2=Hamilton|first2=Bernard |last3=Stoyanov|first3=Yuri |title=Christian Dualist Heresies in the Byzantine World, C. 650-c. 1450: Selected Sources|year=1998|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-4765-7|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Catharism|Cathars]], a Christian sect in southern France, believed that there was a dualism between two gods, one representing good and the other representing evil. The Roman Catholic Church denounced the Cathars as heretics, and sought to crush the movement in the 13th century. The [[Albigensian Crusade]] was initiated by [[Pope Innocent III]] in 1208 to remove the Cathars from [[Languedoc]] in France, where they were known as Albigesians. The [[Medieval Inquisition|Inquisition]], which began in 1233 under [[Pope Gregory IX]], also targeted the Cathars.&lt;ref name="Chidester"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chidester|first=David|title=Christianity: A Global History|year=2001|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-251770-8|pages=266–268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gnosticism====
[[Gnosticism]] is a diverse, [[syncretistic]] [[religious movement]] consisting of various [[belief systems]] generally united in the teaching that humans are divine [[soul]]s trapped in a [[Nature|material world]] created by an imperfect god, the [[demiurge]], who is frequently identified with the [[Abrahamic]] [[God]]. The demiurge may be depicted as an embodiment of evil, or in other instances as merely imperfect and as benevolent as its inadequacy permits. This demiurge exists alongside another remote and unknowable [[God|supreme being]] that embodies good.

[[Bogomils]], [[Paulicianism|Paulicans]] and [[Cathar]]s are typically seen as being imitative of Gnosticism. Whether or not the Cathari possessed direct historical influence from ancient Gnosticism is a matter of dispute. The basic conceptions of Gnostic cosmology are, however, to be found in Cathar beliefs (most distinctly in their notion of a lesser creator god). Unlike the second century Gnostics, they did not apparently place any special relevance upon knowledge (''gnosis'') as an effective [[Salvation|salvific]] force.

===In Hinduism===
The [[Dvaita Vedanta]] school of [[Indian philosophy]] espouses a dualism between God and the universe by theorizing the existence of two separate [[realities]]. The first and the more important reality is that of [[Shiva]] or [[Shakti]] or [[Vishnu]] or [[Brahman]]. Shiva or Shakti or Vishnu is the supreme [[Self]], God, the absolute truth of the universe, the independent reality. The second reality is that of dependent but equally real universe that exists with its own separate essence. Everything that is composed of the second reality, such as individual soul ([[Jiva]]), matter, etc. exist with their own separate reality. The distinguishing factor of this philosophy as opposed to [[Advaita Vedanta]] ([[monistic]] conclusion of Vedas) is that God takes on a personal role and is seen as a real eternal entity that governs and controls the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Etter, Christopher. [https://books.google.com/books?id=jW2pcWpXY8wC&amp;pg=PA59 A Study of Qualitative Non-Pluralism]. iUniverse Inc. P. 59-60. {{ISBN|0-595-39312-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=March 2018}} Because the existence of individuals is grounded in the divine, they are depicted as reflections, images or even shadows of the divine, but never in any way identical with the divine. [[Moksha|Salvation]] therefore is described as the realization that all finite reality is essentially dependent on the Supreme.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, Jeaneane D. [https://books.google.com/books?id=8dRZ4E-qgz8C&amp;pg=PA340&amp;dq=dualism+dvaita+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VoXnT_6RH8qtrAeO3qmJCQ&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=dualism%20dvaita%20vedanta&amp;f=false Perspectives of Reality: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Hinduism]. Sussex Academic Press. P. 340-344. {{ISBN|1-898723-93-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ontological dualism==
[[Image:Yin yang.svg|right|100px|thumb|The yin and yang symbolizes the duality in nature and all things in the Taoist religion.]]

Alternatively, ''dualism'' can mean the tendency of humans to perceive and understand the world as being divided into two overarching [[categorization|categories]]. In this sense, it is dualistic when one perceives a tree as a thing separate from everything surrounding it. This form of ontological dualism exists in Taoism and Confucianism, beliefs that divide the universe into the complementary oppositions of [[yin and yang]].&lt;ref name="Girardot"&gt;{{cite book|last=Girardot|first=N.J.|title=Myth and Meaning in Early Taoism: The Theme of Chaos (hun-tun)|year=1988|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-06460-7|page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt; In traditions such as classical Hinduism, [[Zen]] Buddhism or [[Islam]]ic [[Sufi]]sm, a key to enlightenment is "transcending" this sort of dualistic thinking, without merely substituting dualism with [[monism]] or [[Pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]].

===In Chinese philosophy===

The opposition and combination of the universe's two basic principles of [[yin and yang]] is a large part of [[Chinese philosophy]], and is an important feature of [[Taoism]], both as a philosophy and as a religion, although the concept developed much earlier. Some argue that yin and yang were originally an earth and sky god, respectively.&lt;ref name="Yin and Yang"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roberts|first1=Jeremy|title=Yin and Yang|url=http://online.infobase.com/HRC/Search/Details/239492?q=yin%20and%20yang|website=Ancient and Medieval History|publisher=Facts on File|accessdate=19 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As one of the oldest principles in Chinese philosophy, yin and yang are also discussed in [[Confucianism]], but to a lesser extent.

Some of the common associations with yang and yin, respectively, are: male and female, [[light]] and [[darkness|dark]], active and passive, motion and stillness. Some scholars believe that the two ideas may have originally referred to two opposite sides of a mountain, facing towards and away from the sun.&lt;ref name="Yin and Yang"/&gt; The yin and yang symbol in actuality has very little to do with Western dualism; instead it represents the philosophy of balance, where two opposites co-exist in harmony and are able to transmute into each other. In the yin-yang symbol there is a dot of yin in yang and a dot of yang in yin. In Taoism, this symbolizes the inter-connectedness of the opposite forces as different aspects of Tao, the First Principle. Contrast is needed to create a distinguishable reality, without which we would experience nothingness. Therefore, the independent principles of yin and yang are actually dependent on one another for each other's distinguishable existence.

The complementary dualistic concept seen in yin and yang represent the reciprocal interaction throughout nature, related to a [[feedback loop]], where opposing forces do not exchange in opposition but instead exchange reciprocally to promote stabilization similar to [[homeostasis]]. An underlying principle in Taoism states that within every independent entity lies a part of its opposite. Within sickness lies health and vice versa. This is because all opposites are manifestations of the single Tao, and are therefore not independent from one another, but rather a variation of the same unifying force throughout all of nature.

== In traditional religions ==

=== Uralic peoples ===
In a [[Nenets people|Nenets]] myth, Num and [[Nga (god)|Nga]] collaborate and compete with each other, creating land,&lt;ref name=land&gt;Vértes 1990: 104, 105&lt;/ref&gt; there are also other myths about competing-collaborating demiurges.&lt;ref&gt;Zolotarjov 1980: 47–48&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comparative studies of Uralic peoples and Kets ===
Among others, also dualistic myths were investigated in researches which tried to compare the mythologies of Siberian peoples and settle the problem of their origins. [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (philologist)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]] and [[Vladimir Toporov]] compared the [[mythology]] of [[Ket people]] with those of [[Uralic peoples]], assuming in the studies, that there are modelling [[Semiotics|semiotic]] systems in the compared mythologies; and they have also made typological comparisons.&lt;ref&gt;Ivanov &amp; Toporov 1973&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ivanov 1984:390, in editorial afterword by Hoppál&lt;/ref&gt; Among others, from possibly Uralic mythological analogies, those of [[Ob-Ugric languages|Ob-Ugric]] peoples&lt;ref&gt;Ivanov 1984: 225, 227, 229&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Samoyedic peoples]]&lt;ref&gt;Ivanov 1984: 229, 230&lt;/ref&gt; are mentioned. Some other discussed analogies (similar folklore [[Motif (narrative)|motifs]], and purely typological considerations, certain binary pairs in symbolics) may be related to dualistic organization of society—some of such dualistic features can be found at these compared peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Ivanov 1984: 229–231&lt;/ref&gt; It must be admitted that, for Kets, neither dualistic organization of society&lt;ref name=noket2org&gt;Zolotaryov 1980: 39&lt;/ref&gt; nor cosmological dualism&lt;ref name=ket2cosm&gt;Zolotaryov 1980: 48&lt;/ref&gt; has been researched thoroughly: if such features existed at all, they have either weakened or remained largely undiscovered;&lt;ref name=noket2org/&gt; although there are some reports on division into two exogamous patrilinear moieties,&lt;ref&gt;Zolotaryov 1980: 37&lt;/ref&gt; folklore on conflicts of mythological figures, and also on cooperation of two beings in creating the land:&lt;ref name=ket2cosm/&gt; the diving of the water fowl.&lt;ref&gt;Ivanov 1984: 229&lt;/ref&gt; If we include dualistic cosmologies meant in broad sense, not restricted to certain concrete motifs, then we find that they are much more widespread, they exist not only among some Uralic peoples, but there are examples in each inhabited continent.&lt;ref name="Zolotarjov"&gt;Zolotarjov 1980: 56&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chukchi ===
A [[Chukchi people|Chukchi]] myth and its variations report the creation of the world; in some variations, it is achieved by the collaboration of several beings ([[bird]]s, collaborating in a coequal way; or the creator and the [[raven]], collaborating in a coequal way; or the creator alone, using the birds only as assistants).&lt;ref&gt;"Zolotarjov 1980: 40–41"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anyiszimov 1981: 92 – 98&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fuegians ===
{{see also|Fuegians#Spiritual culture}}
All three [[Fuegians|Fuegian]] tribes had dualistic myths about [[culture hero]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Gusinde 1966:71&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Yámana]] have dualistic myths about the two {{IPA-xx|joalox|}} brothers. They act as culture heroes, and sometimes stand in an antagonistic relation with each other, introducing opposite laws. Their figures can be compared to the Kwanyip-brothers of the [[Selk'nam]].&lt;ref&gt;Gusinde 1966:181&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the presence of dualistic myths in two compared cultures does not imply relatedness or [[Diffusion (anthropology)|diffusion]] necessarily.&lt;ref name="Zolotarjov" /&gt;

'''Entering Heaven alive''' (called by various [[religion]]s "ascension", "assumption", or "[[Translation (Mormonism)|translation]]") is a belief held in various religions. Since [[death]] is the normal end to an individual's life on [[Earth]] and the beginning of [[afterlife]], entering [[Heaven]] without dying first is considered exceptional and usually a sign of a [[deity]]'s special recognition of the individual's [[piety]].

==Christianity==
[[File:5029-20080122-jerusalem-mt-olives-ascension-rock.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Ascension Rock, inside the [[Chapel of the Ascension (Jerusalem)]], is said to bear the imprint of Jesus' right foot as he left earth and ascended into heaven.&lt;/center&gt;]]
{{See also|Ascension of Jesus|Rapture|Biblical cosmology}}

Unlike the other entries in this article, this paragraph does not, in the view of most Christians, relate to "entering Heaven alive". Jesus is considered by the vast majority of Christians to have died before being resurrected and ascending to heaven. In regard to his mother [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] considers her to have died prior to being assumed (translated) into heaven. In like manner, [[Roman Catholicism]] affirms that Mary, the mother of Jesus, suffered death prior to her assumption which has been "expressly affirmed in the Liturgy of the Church" and is expressly seen in paragraph 20 of the proclamation of this teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Fundamentals of Catholic Dogma, Ludwig Ott, Book III, Pt. 3, Ch. 2, §6, {{ISBN|0-89555-009-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_p-xii_apc_19501101_munificentissimus-deus_en.html |title=Apostolic Constitution of Pope Pius XII / Munificentissimus Deus / Defining the Dogma of the Assumption |publisher=Vatican.va |accessdate=March 30, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904181017/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_p-xii_apc_19501101_munificentissimus-deus_en.html |archivedate=September 4, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Protestantism]] generally believes that [[Protestant views on Mary|Mary]] died a natural death like any other human being and was not subsequently assumed into heaven, although the [[Anglo-Catholic]] tradition of [[Anglicanism]] often affirms the assumption.

Most Christians believe [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Jesus did initially die]], but was then [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrected from the dead by God]], before being [[Ascension of Jesus|raised bodily to heaven]] to [[Session of Christ|sit]] at the [[Right Hand of God]] with a promise to someday [[Second Coming|return to earth]]. The minority views that Jesus didn't die are known as the [[Swoon hypothesis]] and [[Docetism]]. 

Since the adoption of the [[Nicene Creed]] in 325, the [[Ascension of Jesus]] into heaven, as related in the [[New Testament]], has been officially taught by all orthodox [[Christianity|Christian]] churches and is celebrated on [[Ascension Thursday]]. In the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the Ascension of the Lord is a [[Holy Day of Obligation]]. In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] the Ascension is one of twelve [[Great Feasts]].

In the Reformed churches' tradition of [[Calvinism]], belief in the ascension of Christ is included in the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]], the [[Heidelberg Catechism]] and the [[Second Helvetic Confession]]."&lt;ref name=gr&gt;Quotations as cited by Redman, Gary, article/Web page titled [http://debate.org.uk/topics/theo/states_christ_03.html "A Comparison of the Biblical and Islamic Views of the States of Christ]/ Part 2: The State of Exaltation", at "The Muslim-Christian Debate Website". Retrieved March 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Rapture" is a reference to "being caught up" as found in [[First Epistle to the Thessalonians|1 Thessalonians]] 4:17, when the "dead in Christ" and "we who are alive and remain" will be caught up in the clouds to meet the [[The Lord|Lord]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|1|Thess|4:16–17|NKJV}} "For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall always be with the Lord."&lt;/ref&gt;

Another kind of entering Heaven alive is mentioned in the Old Testament: the prophet [[Elijah]] and the patriarch [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]], son of Jared and ancestor of Noah.

===Catholicism===
{{Main|Assumption of Mary}}
The Roman Catholic Church distinguishes between "The Ascension", in which Christ rose to heaven by his own power, and "The Assumption" in which [[Mary, mother of Jesus]], was raised to heaven by God's power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic.net/RCC/Periodicals/Dossier/0506-96/Article6.html |last=Brumley |first=Mark, |title=Mary's Assumption: Irrelevant or Irreverent? |publisher=Catholic.net |accessdate=March 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]] and [[Elijah]] are said in scripture to have been "assumed" [experienced assumption]{{clarification needed|date=April 2017}} into heaven.)

On November 1, 1950, [[Pope Pius XII]], acting ''[[ex cathedra]]'', issued ''[[Munificentissimus Deus]]'', an authoritative statement of official doctrine of [[Roman Catholicism]]. In Section 44 the pope stated:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_p-xii_apc_19501101_munificentissimus-deus_en.html |title=Apostolic Constitution of Pope Pius XII / Munificentissimus Deus / Defining the Dogma of the Assumption |publisher=Vatican.va |accessdate=March 30, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904181017/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_p-xii_apc_19501101_munificentissimus-deus_en.html |archivedate=September 4, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|By the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ, of the Blessed Apostles Peter and Paul, and by our own authority, we pronounce, declare, and define it to be a divinely revealed dogma: that the Immaculate Mother of God, the ever Virgin Mary, having completed the course of her earthly life, was assumed body and soul into heavenly glory.}}

The doctrine is based on [[Sacred Tradition]] that [[Mary, mother of Jesus]], was bodily assumed into heaven. For centuries before that, [[Assumption of the Virgin Mary in art|the assumption was celebrated in art]]. The proclamation states that Mary suffered bodily death before being assumed into Heaven. Some theologians{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} have argued that Mary didn't die, but this is contrary to the text of the dogma's proclamation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic.net/RCC/Periodicals/Dossier/0506-96/Article6.html |last=Brumley |first=Mark |title=Mary's Assumption: Irrelevant or Irreverent?|publisher=Catholic.net |accessdate= March 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern Christianity===
[[File:Theofanus uspenie.jpg|thumb|Orthodox [[icon]] of the [[Dormition of the Theotokos]] (1392, [[Theophan the Greek]]).]]
{{Main|Dormition of the Mother of God}}
The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] teaches that three other persons were taken bodily into heaven: [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]], [[Elijah]] (Elias) and the [[Theotokos]] (Virgin Mary). Similar to the Western "Assumption" of Mary, the Orthodox celebrate the [[Dormition of the Theotokos]] on August 15. Unlike Western uncertainty about Mary's physical death, the Orthodox teach that Mary died a natural death like any other human being, that she was buried by the [[Apostles]] (except for [[Thomas the Apostle|Thomas]], who was late), and three days later (after Thomas had arrived) was found to be missing from her tomb. The church teaches that the Apostles received a revelation during which the Theotokos appeared to them and told them she had been resurrected by Jesus and taken body and soul into heaven. The Orthodox teach that Mary already enjoys the fullness of heavenly bliss that the other saints will experience only after the [[Last Judgment]].

There is a teaching among the Orthodox that the "[[Two Witnesses]]" referred to in the [[Book of Revelation]] {{Bibleverse-nb||Revelation|11:3–13}} are Enoch and Elijah,{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} who will be sent back to earth to preach the Gospel in the time of [[apostasy]], and will be the last Christian [[martyr]]s before the [[Second Coming]]. According to Revelation, they will be resurrected and ascend again to heaven.

She believed that she could create for herself a new kind of “light body”. However, she died and was cremated.

==Islam==
[[File:Jerusalem Dome of the rock BW 3.JPG|thumb|right|The Dome of the Rock]]
{{See also|Kitab al-Miraj}}
Islamic teaching states that [[Muhammad]] ascended into heaven alive at the site of the [[Dome of the Rock]]. However, this ascent was temporary and he came back to Earth. It is ascribed to the exact descriptions presented in both the Quran and the [[Hadith]].

Islamic texts deny the idea of crucifixion or death attributed to [[Islamic view of Jesus|Jesus]] by the New Testament.&lt;ref&gt;Shafaat, Dr. Ahmad, [http://www.islamicperspectives.com/ReturnOfJesus.htm Islamic View of the Coming/Return of Jesus"] article dated May 2003, at the ''Islamic Perspectives'' Web site: "In 4:159, after denying that the Jews killed or crucified Jesus and after stating that God raised him to Himself, the Qur`an says ...". Retrieved March 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Quran]] states that people (i.e., the Jews and Romans) sought to kill Jesus, but they could not crucify or kill him, although "this was made to appear to them". Muslims believe that Jesus was not crucified but instead he was raised by God unto the heavens. This "raising" is often understood to mean through bodily ascension.

Some Islamic scholars have identified the prophet [[Idris (prophet)|Idris]] to be the same person as [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]] from the Bible. This is because the Qu'ran states that God "raised him to a lofty station", and that has been taken to be a term for ascending, upon which it is concluded that "Idris" was "Enoch".

==Judaism==
In the Hebrew bible the word for "heavens" is ''[[Heaven in Judaism|shamayim]]''. This is plural - it means "heavens", not "heaven" - but seems nevertheless to have a singular meaning: i.e., the older parts of the bible speak of "heavens" in the plural but evidence for a belief in more than one heaven from the bible is lacking. Shamayim also meant "sky", the atmosphere, as it does in modern English. The blue dome of the sky was called the ''[[Firmament|raqia]]'', and was believed to be a solid shield between the atmosphere and the true heaven where God lived.{{dubious|date=December 2016}} Heaven was the realm of God, earth of mankind, and the [[underworld]] was for the dead, and travel between them was generally impossible, although God and his messengers frequently appear on earth and the dead can be summoned up from the underworld as the [[Witch of Endor]] summons the shade of Samuel.

There are two possible exceptions to this general rule that humans could not go to heaven, Enoch and Elijah, but neither is clear. The [[Book of Genesis]] mentions [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]] as one who "was no more" because "God took him", but it does not explicitly say whether he was alive or dead, and it does not say where God took him. The [[Books of Kings]] describes the prophet [[Elijah]] being taken towards "shamayim" in a whirlwind, but the word can mean both heaven as the abode of God, or the sky (as the word "heavens" does in modern English), and so again the text is ambiguous.

According to the post-biblical [[Jewish]] [[Midrash]], eight people went to heaven (also referred to as the [[Garden of Eden]] and [[Paradise]]) alive:&lt;ref&gt;''Derekh Erez Zuta'' (post-Talmudic tractate) cited in ''Encyclopedia Judaica'' New York 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ascended Master Teachings==
Members of various [[Ascended Master Teachings]], a group of [[New Age]] religions based on [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], believe that [[Francis Bacon]] underwent a physical Ascension without experiencing death (he then became the deity [[St. Germain (Theosophy)|St. Germain]]). They also believe numerous others have undergone Ascension; they are called the [[Ascended master|Ascended Masters]] and are worshipped in this group of religions.

==Fictional portrayals==
* In [[C. S. Lewis]]'s ''[[That Hideous Strength]]'', those who ascended to heaven alive included [[Melchizedek]], [[Frederick Barbarossa]], [[King Arthur]] and [[Elwin Ransom]].
* In C. S. Lewis's ''[[The Voyage of the Dawn Treader]]'', [[Reepicheep]] the Mouse is permitted to travel into [[Aslan's Country]] while alive. He is next seen in ''[[The Last Battle]]'' where he is the first to greet the protagonists when they arrive at Aslan's Country.
* In [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[Middle-earth legendarium]], Elves who grow weary of life in [[Middle-earth]] may sail west to the [[Undying Lands]]. A few mortals also follow this route, including [[Eärendil]], the [[Ring-bearers]] [[Bilbo Baggins]], [[Frodo Baggins]], and [[Sam Gamgee]], and the Dwarf [[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli]].
* In the [[fictional universe]] of the ''[[Stargate]]'' franchise, the [[Ancient (Stargate)|Ancients]], have learned how to "ascend" from the physical plane and have [[Ascension (Stargate)|moved on to a higher plane of existence]].
* In [[Gabriel García Márquez]]'s ''[[One Hundred Years of Solitude]]'', Remedios the Beauty, is said to be the most beautiful woman ever seen in Macondo, who unintentionally causes the deaths of several men who love or lust over her. She appears to most of the town as naively innocent, and some come to think that she is mentally handicapped. However, Colonel Aureliano Buendía believes she has inherited great lucidity: "It is as if she's come back from twenty years of war", he said. She rejects clothing and beauty. Too beautiful and, arguably, too wise for the world, Remedios ascends into the sky one afternoon in the 4pm sun, while folding Fernanda's white sheet.

The '''Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church''' is an offshoot of the [[Rastafari]] movement that flourished in the 1970s in Jamaica and was incorporated in [[Florida]] in 1975. Members of the movement say it is based on the teachings of [[Marcus Garvey]] and that they use  [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] as the Rastafari [[sacrament]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/hemp/potbible.htm Marijuana and the Bible]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979 the group was accused, tried, and convicted of smuggling massive amounts of potent cannabis from [[Jamaica]] to [[Miami]] in actions that kept the Jamaican economy afloat that decade. The then-Jamaican Prime Minister [[Edward Seaga]] told a U.S. interview "It's just a little ''[[:wikt:sinsemilla|sinsemilla]]'' that it keep the country going right now". The Coptics published a free newspaper promoting Garveyism and the decriminalization of marijuana. They were also featured on a sensational episode of ''[[60 Minutes]]'' on October 28, 1979. The group's leader was Thomas Reilly, also known as [[Brother Louv]]. During the same year, The Supreme Court of Florida found: "(1) the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church represents a religion within the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and (2) the “use of cannabis is an essential portion of the religious practice."&lt;ref name="Court"/&gt; "Further, the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church is not a new church or religion but the record reflects it is centuries old and has regularly used cannabis as its sacrament”.&lt;ref name="Court"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ethiopianzioncopticchurch.org/Legal/Town_1979|title=Town v. State, 377 So.2d 648 (Fla. 1979)|date=November 1, 1979|accessdate=March 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986 the organization participated in the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]]'s hearings on [[cannabis rescheduling in the United States]].

On August 8, 1994 [[Jim Tranmer]], a former member of the group, wrote a letter to Carl Olsen while meditating on his 35-year prison sentence and his departure from the EZCC's "malicious hierarchy".  Olsen ran for governor in Iowa, as a Libertarian, in 1994 and for the U.S. House of Representatives, again as a Libertarian, in 1996.  He is currently a priest in the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church, and resides in Iowa.

The EZCC is not associated with the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]] or the [[Coptic Catholic Church]], both based in [[Egypt]]. The Coptic Orthodox Church has an Ethiopian sister church, which is also unrelated.

The Zion Coptic Church was featured in the 2011 [[Billy Corben]] documentary ''[[Square Grouper: The Godfathers of Ganja]]'', whose first section concerns the group and features interviews with former members.

[[File:伏見稲荷５.JPG|thumb|250px|Altar to [[Inari Ōkami]] at the [[Fushimi Inari-taisha|Fushimi Inari Shrine]] in [[Kyoto]]. [[Shinto]] is the ethnic religion of the [[Japanese people]].]]

In [[religious studies]], an '''ethnic religion''' (or '''indigenous religion''') is a [[religion]] associated with a particular [[ethnic group]]. Ethnic religions are often distinguished from [[universalizing religion|universal religions]] which claim to not be limited in ethnic or national scope, such as [[Christianity]] or [[Islam]] or [[Buddhism]] or [[Jainism]].&lt;ref name="Hinnells"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Routledge companion to the study of religion |last=Hinnells |first=John R. |year=2005 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-33311-3 |pages=439–440 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IGspjXKxIf8C |accessdate=2009-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnic religions are not only independent religions. Some localised denominations of global religions are practised solely by certain ethnic groups. For example, the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] have a unique denominational structure of Christianity known as the [[Assyrian Church of the East]].

== Terminology ==
A number of alternative terms have been used instead of "ethnic" or "indigenous" religions.

The term "primal religion" was coined by [[Andrew Walls]] in the University of Aberdeen in the 1970s to provide a focus on non-Western forms of religion as found in Africa, Asia, and Oceania.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cox|first=James L.|last2=Sutcliffe|first2=Steven J.|date=1 March 2006|title=Religious studies in Scotland: A persistent tension with divinity|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.religion.2005.12.001|journal=Religion|volume=36|issue=1|pages=1–28|doi=10.1016/j.religion.2005.12.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terms such as "primal religion," "primitive religion," and "tribal religion" have been contested by Walls' student, Jim Cox, who argues that such terms suggest an undeveloped religion which can be seen as a preparation for conversion to Christianity. Cox prefers to use the term "indigenous religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=From Primitive to Indigenous: The Academic Study of Indigenous Religions|last=Cox|first=James L.|publisher=Ashgate|year=2007|isbn=978-0-754-65569-5|location=Aldershot|pages=9–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another term that is often used is "[[folk religion]]." While "ethnic religion" and "folk religion" have overlapping uses, the latter term implies "the appropriation of religious beliefs and practices at a popular level."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions|last=Bowker|first=John|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0-191-72722-1|location=New York|pages=|chapter=Folk Religion}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "folk religion" can therefore be used to speak of [[Chinese folk religion|Chinese]] and [[Traditional African religion|African]] indigenous religions, but can also refer to popular expressions of more multi-national and institutionalized religions such as [[Folk Christianity]] or [[Folk Islam]].

== Usage ==
Ethnic religions are distinctive in their relationship with a particular [[ethnic group]] and often in the shaping of one's solidarity with an ethnic identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ethnicity and Religion: Intersections and Comparisons|last=|first=|publisher=Routledge|year=2011|isbn=978-1-138-88037-5|editor-last=Ruane|editor-first=Joseph B.|location=London|pages=|editor-last2=Todd|editor-first2=Jennifer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some ethnic religions include [[Hinduism]] of the [[Indian people|Indians]], [[Judaism]] of the [[Jews]], [[Chinese folk religion]] of the [[Han Chinese]], [[Shinto]] of the [[Japanese people|Japanese]], and [[Serer religion|A ƭat Roog]] of the [[Serer people|Serer]] of [[Senegal]], [[The Gambia]], and [[Mauritania]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Diedrich Hermann Westermann|Westermann, Diedrich]]; Smith, Edwin William; Forde, Cyril Daryll; [[International African Institute]]; [[International Institute of African Languages and Cultures]]; [[Project Muse]]; [[JSTOR]] (Organization), ''Africa: journal of the International African Institute, Volume 63'', pp 86-96, 270-1, [[Edinburgh University Press]] for the International African Institute (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diaspora|Diasporic]] groups often maintain ethnic religions as a means of maintaining a distinct ethnic identity, such as [[Hinduism]] among [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|diasporic Indians]] in the [[Caribbean]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Netherlands]], [[Southern Africa|southern]] and [[East Africa|eastern Africa]], [[Mauritius]], [[Fiji]], and the [[Malay Peninsula]],&lt;ref name="van der Veer"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/3773407 |last=van der Veer |first=Peter |author2=Steven Vertovec |date=April 1991 |title=Brahmanism Abroad: On Caribbean Hinduism as an Ethnic Religion |journal=Ethnology |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=149–166|jstor=3773407 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or the role of [[Traditional African religion|African traditional religion]] and [[Afro-American religions]] among the [[African diaspora in the Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thegrio.com/2011/10/19/african-religions-gain-following-among-black-christians/|title=Are blacks abandoning Christianity for African faiths?|last=Oduah|first=Chika|date=19 October 2011|website=theGrio|access-date=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some ancient ethnic religions, such as those historically found in pre-modern Europe, have found new vitality in [[Modern Paganism|neopaganism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Handbook of New Religious Movements|last=Lewis|first=James R.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|isbn=978-0-195-36964-9|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, non-ethnic religions such as Christianity have been known to assume ethnic traits to an extent that they serve a role as an important ethnic identity marker,&lt;ref name="Chong"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/3711911 |last=Chong |first=Kelly H. |year=1997 |title=What It Means to Be Christian: The Role of Religion in the Construction of Ethnic Identity and Boundary Among Second- Generation Korean Americans |journal=Sociology of Religion |volume=59 |issue=3 |pages=259–286|jstor=3711911 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a notable example of this is the Serbian "Saint-Savianism" of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=UxDRgBAOKLAC&amp;pg=PA158&amp;dq=serbian+nationalism+st+sava&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjrjovEvM7TAhUJ2mMKHeixDgIQ6AEILDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=serbian%20nationalism%20st%20sava&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2235">'''Gnostic saints''' are a series of historical figures revered in [[Gnosticism|Gnostic Christianity]] as celebrated in several Gnostic Christian churches. One such list of saints appears in the Collect of the Day of All Gnostic Saints of [[Ecclesia Gnostica]], which reads as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Praise be to Thee, O Father of all Fatherhood, Thou, the unknown God, who was before the fall of the sparks into the darkness of this aeon, for the glorious messengers of the light of Thy everlasting and redeeming Gnosis. Especially do we praise and thank Thee today for the following holy and enlightened teachers and knowers of truth: Valentinus of Rome; Basilides of Antioch; Carpocrates of Alexandria; Bardesanes of Syria; Mani of Babylonia, Martyr; Priscillian of Avila, Bishop and Martyr; Paul of Samosata, Bishop; Peter of Bruys, Martyr; Amalric of Bena; David of Dinan and William of Paris; Bogomil of Dragowitza, Bishop; Peter Waldo of Lyons; Joachim of Flora; Esclaremonde de Foix and the Cathar martyrs; and all the holy souls and wise sages who have in any way or form, under whatsoever guise and appearance attained to and taught the true and ancient Gnosis of God. Grant, O Boundless One, that inspired by and following their most noble example we also may see the light of Thy Gnosis and assist in liberating Thy sparks of light from the chains of darkness, ignorance and malice which afflict them in this aeon. 
Amen."&lt;ref&gt;Ecclesia Gnostica. [http://www.gnosis.org/ecclesia/lect162.htm Meditations: Day of All Gnostic Saints]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3675">The '''Institute on Religion in an Age of Science''' (IRAS) is a [[non-denominational]] society that promotes and facilitates the ongoing dialectic between religion and science. The Institute has held annual week-long conferences at [[Star Island (New Hampshire)|Star Island]] in [[New Hampshire]] since 1954. The conference attracts about 250 members and non-members each year.

==Mission==
In its Constitution, the IRAS purpose is stated as follows: "The Institute on Religion in an Age of Science is established
* to promote creative efforts leading to the formulation, in the light of contemporary knowledge, of effective doctrines and practice for human welfare;
* to formulate dynamic and positive relationships between the concepts developed by science and the goals and hopes of humanity expressed through religion; and
* to state human values in such universal and valid terms that they be understood by all peoples, whatever their cultural background or experience, in such a way as to provide a basis for world-wide cooperation.

The IRAS Council adopted the following statement in 2003:
“We at IRAS take the natural world seriously as a primary source of meaning. Our quest is informed and guided by the deepening and evolving understandings fostered by scientific inquiry.

“From here, our quests for meaning take us in divergent directions. For some, the natural world and its emergent manifestations in human experience and creativity are the focus of exploration. Some go on to encounter and celebrate the sacred in such explorations. For some, understandings of the natural world are interwoven with understandings inherent in various religious traditions, generating additional paths of exploration and encounter. As a result, we articulate our emerging orientations with many voices that are harmonious in that we share a common sense of place and gratitude.

“We acknowledge as well a shared set of values and concerns pertaining to peace, justice, dignity, cultural and ecological diversity and planetary sustainability. Although we may differ and hence debate as to how these concerns are here addressed, we are committed to participating in their resolution.”

==History==
IRAS evolved from the ideas of two pioneer groups. The first was a group of scientists from the Committee on Science and Values of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]. The second group was an interfaith, religious coalition which hoped to revitalize religion for today's needs. Members of both groups saw what some perceived as a battlefield of conflicting ideologies to be a place of opportunity for a constructive relationship to emerge.

In 1954 the scientists accepted an invitation to present their views to the religious group at a seven-day conference on Religion in an Age of Science on Star Island. On November 9, 1954, members of the two groups established the Institute on Religion in an Age of Science to work toward these goals.

Presidents of the Institute have included [[Harlow Shapley]], [[Philip Hefner]], [[Ursula Goodenough]], and [[Varadaraja V. Raman]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14230">[[File:Jerusalem Syndrome.jpg|thumb]]
'''Jerusalem syndrome''' is a group of mental phenomena involving the presence of either religiously-themed [[Fixation (psychology)|obsessive]] ideas, [[delusion]]s or other [[psychosis]]-like experiences that are triggered by a visit to the city of [[Jerusalem]]. It is not endemic to one single religion or denomination but has affected [[Judaism|Jews]], [[Christianity|Christians]], and [[Islam|Muslims]] of many different backgrounds. It is not listed as a recognised condition in the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]''.

The best known, although not the most prevalent, manifestation of Jerusalem syndrome is the phenomenon whereby a person who seems previously balanced and devoid of any signs of [[psychopathology]] becomes [[psychosis|psychotic]] after arriving in Jerusalem.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} The psychosis is characterised by an intense religious theme and typically resolves to full recovery after a few weeks or after being removed from the area. The religious focus of Jerusalem syndrome distinguishes it from other phenomena, such as [[Stendhal syndrome]] in [[Florence]] or [[Paris syndrome]] for [[Japanese people|Japanese]] tourists.

In a 2000 article in the ''British Journal of Psychiatry'', Bar-El et al. claim to have identified and described a specific syndrome which emerges in tourists with no previous [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] history.&lt;ref name="Bar-El"&gt;Bar-el Y, Durst R, Katz G, Zislin J, Strauss Z, Knobler HY. (2000) Jerusalem syndrome. ''[[British Journal of Psychiatry]]'', 176, 86-90. [http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/full/176/1/86 Full text]&lt;/ref&gt; However, this claim has been disputed by M. Kalian and E. Witztum.&lt;ref name="Kalian2000"&gt;Kalian M, Witztum E. (2000) "Comments on Jerusalem syndrome". ''[[British Journal of Psychiatry]]'', 176, 492. [http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/full/176/5/492-a Full text]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kalian1999"&gt;Kalian M, Witztum E. (1999) "The Jerusalem syndrome&amp;mdash;fantasy and reality a survey of accounts from the 19th and 20th centuries." ''Isr. J. Psychiatry Relat Sci.'', 36(4):260-71. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10687302?dopt=Abstract Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;  Kalian and Witztum stressed that nearly all of the tourists who demonstrated the described behaviours were mentally ill prior to their arrival in Jerusalem. They further noted that, of the small proportion of tourists alleged to have exhibited spontaneous [[psychosis]] after arrival in Jerusalem, Bar-El et al. had presented no evidence that the tourists had been well prior to their arrival in the city. Jerusalem syndrome is not listed or mentioned in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]] nor in the [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems|ICD]].

Jerusalem syndrome has previously been regarded as a form of hysteria, referred to as "Jerusalem squabble poison", or "''fièvre Jérusalemienne''".&lt;ref&gt;Elon, Amos.''Jerusalem, City of Mirrors''. Little, Brown, 1989, p. 147. {{ISBN|978-0-316-23388-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first clinically described in the 1930s by Jerusalem [[psychiatrist]] Heinz Herman, one of the founders of modern psychiatric research in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbl-site.org/publications/article.aspx?articleId=374 The Jerusalem Syndrome in Biblical Archaeology].&lt;/ref&gt;  Whether or not these behaviors specifically arise from visiting Jerusalem is debated, as similar behaviors have been noted at other places of religious and historical importance such as [[Mecca]] and [[Rome]] (see [[Stendhal syndrome]]). It is known that cases of the syndrome had already been observed during the [[Middle Ages]], since it was described in the itinerary of [[Felix Fabri]] and the biography of [[Margery Kempe]]. Other cases were described in the vast literature of visitors to Jerusalem during the 19th century.

Bar-El et al. suggested that at the approach of the year 2000, large numbers of otherwise normal visitors might be affected by a combination of their presence in Jerusalem and the religious significance of the millennium, causing a massive increase in the numbers of Jerusalem syndrome admissions to hospital. Despite a slight increase in tourist hospitalisations with the rise in total tourism to Jerusalem during the year 2000, the feared epidemic of Jerusalem syndrome never materialised &lt;ref name="Bar-El" /&gt;.

==Types==
The classic Jerusalem syndrome, where a visit to Jerusalem seems to trigger an intense [[Religious delusion|religious psychosis]] that resolves quickly after or on departure, has been a subject of debate in the medical literature.&lt;ref name="Kalian2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kalian1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fastovsky"&gt;Fastovsky N, Teitelbaum A, Zislin J, Katz G, Durst R. (2000) Jerusalem syndrome or paranoid schizophrenia? ''Psychiatric Services'', 51 (11), 1454. [https://ps.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ps.51.11.1454 Full text]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the discussion has centered on whether this definition of the Jerusalem syndrome is a distinct form of psychosis, or simply a re-expression of a previously existing psychotic illness that was not picked up by the medical authorities in Israel.

In response to this, Bar-El et al. classified the syndrome&lt;ref name="Bar-El"/&gt; into three major types to reflect the different types of interactions between a visit to Jerusalem and unusual or psychosis-related thought processes. However Kalian and Witztum have objected, saying that Bar-El et al. presented no evidence to justify the detailed typology and [[prognosis]] presented and that the types in fact seem to be unrelated rather than different aspects of a [[syndrome]].

===Type I===
''Jerusalem syndrome imposed on a previous psychotic illness.'' This refers to individuals already diagnosed as having a [[psychosis|psychotic]] illness before their visit to Jerusalem. They have typically gone to the city because of the influence of religious ideas, often with a goal or mission in mind that they believe needs to be completed on arrival or during their stay. For example, an affected person may believe himself to be an important historical religious figure or may be influenced by important religious ideas or concepts (such as causing the coming of the [[Jewish Messiah|Messiah]] or the [[Second Coming|second coming of Christ]]).

===Type II===
''Jerusalem syndrome superimposed on and complicated by [[Idiosyncrasy|idiosyncratic]] ideas.'' This does not necessarily take the form of mental illness and may simply be a culturally anomalous obsession with the significance of Jerusalem, either as an individual, or as part of a small religious group with idiosyncratic spiritual beliefs.

===Type III===
''Jerusalem syndrome as a discrete form, uncompounded by previous mental illness.'' This describes the best-known type, whereby a previously mentally balanced person becomes psychotic after arriving in Jerusalem. The psychosis is characterised by an intense religious character and typically resolves to full recovery after a few weeks or after being removed from the locality. It shares some features with the diagnostic category of a "brief psychotic episode", although a distinct pattern of behaviors has been noted:{{By whom|date=January 2013}}

# Anxiety, agitation, nervousness and tension, plus other unspecified reactions.
# Declaration of the desire to split away from the group or the family and to tour Jerusalem alone. Tour guides aware of the Jerusalem syndrome and of the significance of such declarations may at this point refer the tourist to an institution for psychiatric evaluation in an attempt to preempt the subsequent stages of the syndrome. If unattended, these stages are usually unavoidable.
# A need to be clean and pure: obsession with taking baths and showers; compulsive fingernail and toenail cutting.
# Preparation, often with the aid of hotel bed-linen, of a long, ankle-length, toga-like gown, which is always white.
# The need to shout psalms or verses from the Bible, or to sing hymns or spirituals loudly. Manifestations of this type serve as a warning to hotel personnel and tourist guides, who should then attempt to have the tourist taken for professional treatment. Failing this, the two last stages will develop.
# A procession or march to one of Jerusalem's holy places, ex:The Western Wall.
# Delivery of a sermon in a holy place. The sermon is typically based on a plea to humankind to adopt a more wholesome, moral, simple way of life. Such sermons are typically ill-prepared and disjointed.
# Paranoid belief that a Jerusalem syndrome agency is after the individual, causing their symptoms of psychosis through poisoning and medicating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fastovsky|first1=Natasha|last2=Teitelbaum|first2=Alexander|last3=Zislin|first3=Josef|last4=Katz|first4=Gregory|last5=Durst|first5=Rimona|title=The Jerusalem Syndrome|journal=Psychiatric Services|date=August 2000|volume=51|issue=8|pages=1052-a–1052|doi=10.1176/appi.ps.51.8.1052-a|url=https://ps.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ps.51.8.1052-a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bar-El et al. reported 42 such cases over a period of 13 years, but in no case were they able to actually confirm that the condition was temporary.

==Prevalence==
During a period of 13 years (1980–1993) for which admissions to the [[Kfar Shaul mental health center|Kfar Shaul Mental Health Centre]] in Jerusalem were analysed, it was reported&lt;ref name="Bar-El"/&gt; that 1,200 tourists with severe, Jerusalem-themed mental problems were referred to this clinic. Of these, 470 were admitted to hospital. On average, 100 such tourists have been seen annually, 40 of them requiring admission to hospital. About three and a half million tourists visit Jerusalem each year. Kalian and Witztum note that as a proportion of the total numbers of tourists visiting the city, this is not significantly different from any other city.&lt;ref name="Kalian2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tannock"&gt;Tannock C, Turner T.

'''John Courtney Murray''', [[Society of Jesus|SJ]], (September 12, 1904&amp;nbsp;– August 16, 1967), was an American [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]] and [[Theology|theologian]], who was especially known for his efforts to reconcile [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]] and [[religious pluralism]], particularly focusing on the relationship between [[Freedom of religion|religious freedom]] and the institutions of a democratically structured modern state.

During the [[Second Vatican Council]], he played a key role in persuading the assembly of the Catholic bishops to adopt the Council's ground-breaking Declaration on Religious Liberty, ''[[Dignitatis humanae]]''.

==Early life and education==
John Courtney Murray was born in [[New York City]] on September 12, 1904. In 1920 he entered the New York province of the [[Society of Jesus]]. He studied [[Classics]] and [[Philosophy]] at [[Boston College]], receiving [[bachelor's]] and [[master's]] degrees in 1926 and 1927 respectively. Following his graduation, he travelled to the [[Philippines]], where he taught [[Latin]] and [[English literature]] at the [[Ateneo de Manila University|Ateneo de Manila]].&lt;ref name=ignsp&gt;[http://www.ignatianspirituality.com/ignatian-voices/20th-century-ignatian-voices/john-courtney-murray-sj "John Courtney Murray, SJ (1904-1967)"], Ignatian Spirituality&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1930, Murray returned to the [[United States]]. He was ordained a [[Roman Catholic]] [[priest]] in 1933. 
He pursued further studies at the [[Gregorian University]] in [[Rome]] and in 1937, he completed a [[doctorate]] in [[sacred theology]].&lt;ref name=ignsp/&gt;

After his return from Rome to the United States, just before the beginning of World War II, he joined the Jesuit theologate in [[Woodstock, Maryland]] and taught Catholic [[Trinitarianism|trinitarian]] theology. In 1940, Murray still fully supported the [[Catholic doctrine]] that there was no salvation outside the Church.&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;

In 1941, he was named editor of the Jesuit journal ''[[Theological Studies (journal)|Theological Studies]]''. He held both positions until his death.&lt;ref name=ignsp/&gt;

As representative of the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]] and consultant to the religious affairs section of the [[Allied High Commission]], he helped draft and promote the 1943 ''Declaration on World Peace'', an [[interfaith]] statement of principles for [[postwar]] reconstruction, and successfully promoted a close [[constitutional]] arrangement between the restored [[Germany|German state]] and the [[Christian Church|Church]], which included sharing of tax revenue with the churches.

By 1944, Murray's endorsement of full co-operation with other [[theists]] led many Catholics to complain that he endangered American Catholic faith, who at the time, recommended minimal cooperation with non-Catholics for fear that lay Catholic faith would be weakened.&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;

Similarly, Murray advocated religious freedom as defined and protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] of the [[U.S. Constitution]] which contradicted  Catholic [[doctrine]]s of church/state relations before Vatican II.&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Courtney-Murray|title=Murray, John Courtney, American theologian|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=2017-04-18| language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postwar reconstruction===
{{Ecumenical councils of the Catholic Church}}
While his background and training suggest a heavily [[theoretical]] bent, Murray became a leading public figure, and his work dealt primarily with the tensions between [[religion]] and public life. His best-known book, ''We Hold These Truths: Catholic Reflections on the American Proposition'' (1960), collects a number of his essays on such topics&lt;ref&gt;[http://woodstock.georgetown.edu/library/Murray/whtt_index.htm Murray SJ, John Courtney. ''We Hold These Truths: Catholic Reflections on the American Proposition''], (Sheed &amp; Ward, 1960)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951 to 1952, following a lectureship at [[Yale University]], he collaborated on a project with [[Robert Morrison MacIver]] of [[Columbia University]] to assess [[academic freedom]] and [[religious education]] in American [[public universities]]. Ultimately, the proposal argued for tax aid to [[private schools]] and for sympathetic exposure of religious faiths in [[public school (government funded)|public schools]]. The project was both nationally influential and personally formative, as it deepened Murray's understanding of and esteem for American [[constitutional law]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

In his increasingly public role, several American [[bishop]]s consulted Murray on legal issues such as [[censorship]] and [[birth control]]. He argued against what he saw as the reactionary and coercive practices of some Catholic bishops and instead advocated participation in substantive public debate, which he suggested offered a better appeal to public virtue. Instead of civic coercion, he argued, presenting moral opinions in the context of public discourse enabled Americans to both deepen their moral commitments and safeguard the 'genius' of American freedoms.

From 1958 to 1962, he served at the [[Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions]], applying [[just war]] criteria to [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-American relations.

===Tensions with the Vatican, 1954===
By the late 1940s, Murray argued, that Catholic teaching on [[separation of church and state#Catholic views|church/state relations]] was inadequate to the "moral functioning" of contemporary peoples. The [[Anglo-America]]n West, he claimed, had developed a fuller truth about [[human dignity]], which was the responsibility of all citizens to assume "moral control" over their own religious beliefs and to wrest control from [[paternalistic]] states. That truth was an "intention of nature" or a new dictate of [[natural law]] philosophy.&lt;ref name=ignsp/&gt;

Murray’s claim that a "new moral truth" had emerged outside the church led to conflict with Cardinal [[Alfredo Ottaviani]], Pro-Secretary of the Vatican [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith|Holy Office]]. In 1954, the Vatican demanded for Murray to end both writing on religious freedom and publishing his two latest articles on the issue.&lt;ref name=ignsp/&gt;

===Second Vatican Council, 1963===
In spite of his silencing, Murray continued to write privately on religious liberties and submitted his works to Rome, all of which were rejected.

In 1963, he was invited to the second (but not the first) session of the [[Second Vatican Council]] in which he drafted the third and fourth versions&lt;ref&gt;"Religious freedom-- Vatican II modernizes church-state ties", Agostino Bono, Catholic News Service, 12 Oct 2005, retrieved 15 May 2007.[http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20051103202303/http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0505798.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, it eventually became the council's endorsement of religious freedom ''[[Dignitatis humanae|Dignitatis humanae personae]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Dignitatis humanae personae", Second Vatican Council, 1965, retrieved 15 May 2007 [http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decl_19651207_dignitatis-humanae_en.html]&lt;/ref&gt; After the council, he continued writing on the issue by claiming that the arguments offered by the final [[decree]] were inadequate even if the affirmation of religious freedom was unequivocal.

In 1966, prompted by the [[Vietnam War]], he was appointed to serve on [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s presidential commission, which reviewed [[Selective Service]] classifications. He supported the allowance of a classification for those opposed on moral grounds to some (though not all) wars, but the recommendation was not accepted by the [[Selective Service Administration]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;S.J. Leon Hooper,[http://www.library.georgetown.edu/woodstock/Murray/bio Murray Biography] from ''American National Biography'' Edited by John A Garraty and Mark C. Carnes. New York: Oxford University Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Murray then turned to questions of how the Church might arrive at new theological doctrines. He argued that Catholics who arrived at new truths about God would have to do so in conversation "on a footing of equality" with non-Catholics and [[atheists]]. He suggested greater reforms, including a restructuring of the Church, which he saw as having overdeveloped its notion of authority and hierarchy at the expense of the bonds of love that had, from the start, defined the authentically Christian life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Death==
In August 1967, Murray died of a [[heart attack]] in [[Queens, New York]], one month before his 63rd birthday.&lt;ref name="ignsp"/&gt;

''Karakia'' are generally used to increase the spiritual goodwill of a gathering, so as to increase the likelihood of a favourable outcome. They are also considered a formal greeting when beginning a [[ceremony]]. According to legend, there was a curse on the [[Waiapu River]] which was lifted when [[George Gage (Ringatū minister)|George Gage]] (Hori Keeti) performed ''karakia''. In the [[Māori religion]], ''karakia'' are used to [[ritual|ritually cleanse]] the homes of the deceased after a burial. 

The missionary [[Richard Taylor (missionary) | Richard Taylor]] gives a 19th-century view of the traditional role and scope of ''karakia'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The word ''karakia'', which we use for prayer, formerly meant a spell, charm, or incantation [...] [Maori] have spells suited for all circumstances - to conquer enemies, catch fish, trap rats, and snare birds, to make their kumara grow, and even to bind the obstinate will of woman; to find anything lost; to discover a stray dog; a concealed enemy; in fact, for all their wants. These karakias are extremely numerous [...]&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With the nineteenth-century introduction of Christianity to New Zealand, Māori adopted (or wrote new)  karakia to acknowledge the new faith. Modern karakia tend to contain a blend of Christian and traditional influence, and their poetic language may make literal translations into English not always possible.&lt;ref name="Otago"&gt;"[http://maori.otago.ac.nz/reo-tikanga-treaty/te-reo/karakia Karakia]", Otago University website. Retrieved 23 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern Māori society, performances of ''karakia'' frequently open important meetings and ceremonies, both within a Māori context (such as tribal [[Hui (Māori assembly)|hui]], [[tangihanga|tangi]], or the inauguration of new [[marae]]), and in a wider New Zealand setting in which both Māori and [[Pākehā]] participate (such as the beginning of public meetings or at the departure of official delegations for overseas).

The '''''Kitáb-i-Aqdas''''' or '''''Aqdas''''' is the central book of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] written by [[Bahá'u'lláh]], the founder of the religion, in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;Saiedi, 2000, pp. 224-235.&lt;/ref&gt; The work was written in Arabic under the Arabic title '''''{{transl|ar|ALA|al-Kitābu l-Aqdas}}''''' ({{lang-ar|الكتاب الأقدس}}  / ''al-Kitāb al-ʾaqdās''), but it is commonly referred to by its Persian title, ''Kitáb-i-Aqdas'' ({{lang-fa|كتاب اقدس}}  / ''Ketâb Âqdas''), which was given to the work by Bahá'u'lláh himself. It is sometimes also referred to as  "the Most Holy Book", "the Book of Laws" or the '''Book of Aqdas'''. The word Aqdas has a significance in many languages as the superlative form of a word with its primary letters [[Q-D-Š]].

Bahá'u'lláh had manuscript copies sent to Bahá'ís in Iran some years after the revelation of the ''Kitáb-i-Aqdas'' in 1873, and in 1890–91 (1308 [[Islamic calendar|AH]], 47 [[Baha'i calendar|BE]]) he arranged for the publication of the original Arabic text of the book in Bombay, India.

The ''Aqdas'' is referred to as "the Mother-Book" of the Bahá'í teachings, and the "Charter of the future world civilization".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Effendi|1944|pp=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not, however, only a 'book of laws': much of the content deals with other matters, notably ethical exhortations and addresses to various individuals, groups, and places. The ''Aqdas'' also discusses the establishment of Bahá'í administrative institutions, Bahá'í religious practices, mysticism, laws of personal status, criminal law, spiritual and ethical exhortations, social principles, miscellaneous laws and abrogations, and prophecies.

{{main|Bahá'í laws}}

Bahá'u'lláh stated that the observance of the laws that he prescribed should be subject to "tact and wisdom", and that they do not cause "disturbance and dissension."&lt;ref name="PSmith-law"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Smith |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Smith (historian) |encyclopedia=A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title=law |year=2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location=Oxford |isbn=1-85168-184-1 |pages=223–225}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aqdas6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bahá'u'lláh|1873|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahá'u'lláh thus provided for the progressive application of his laws; for example certain Bahá'í laws are only applicable to [[Middle East]]ern Bahá'ís such as the limit to the period of engagement, while any Bahá'í may practice the laws if they so decide.&lt;ref name="PSmith-law"/&gt; [[Shoghi Effendi]] also stated that certain other laws, such as criminal laws, that are dependent upon the existence of a predominantly Bahá'í society would only be applicable in a possible future Bahá'í society.&lt;ref name="PSmith-law"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PSmith160"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated that if the laws were in conflict with the civil law of the country where a Bahá'í  lives the laws could not be practiced.&lt;ref name="PSmith-law"/&gt; Furthermore, some laws and teachings are, according to Bahá'í teaching, not meant to be applied at the present time and their application depends on decisions by the [[Universal House of Justice]]. Baha'is believe the Aqdas supersedes and succeeds previous revelations such as the [[Quran]] and the [[Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/bhi/aqdas.htm The Aqdas; Universal House of Justice] A DESCRIPTION OF THE AQDAS BY SHOGHI EFFENDI&lt;/ref&gt;

== Form and style ==

The text of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas consists of several hundred verses, which have been grouped in 189 numbered paragraphs in the English translation most of which are just a few sentences.&lt;ref name="JLR19-2"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Danesh |first=Roshan |title=Internationalism and Divine Law: A Bahá'í Perspective |journal=Journal of Law and Religion |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=209–242 |year=2003–2004 |jstor=3649175}}&lt;/ref&gt; The style combines elements of both [[Arabic poetry|poetry]] (''shi'r'') and [[rhymed prose]] (''saj{{'}}'') and the text contains instances of [[literary devices]] like [[alliteration]], [[assonance]], [[Repetition (rhetorical device)|repetition]], [[onomatopoeia]], [[Contrast (linguistics)|juxtaposition]] and [[antithesis]], [[metaphor]]s, [[Narration#Narrative point of view#Alternating person|alternation of person]] and [[personification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bushrui|1994|pp=39–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rules and principles are interspersed and guide interpretation, and authority and limits for authorized interpretation are also specified. It defines a [[Bahá'í Administration]] as part of the [[Covenant of Bahá'u'lláh]], and also speaks to the individual reader, as there are no [[clergy]] in the religion to rely on for guidance. The text also moves between statements said to be plain and statements suggesting the key to understanding the book is to look at the text for clues to itself.&lt;ref name="JLR19-2"/&gt; Some statements reflect on the [[Bahá'í teachings|teachings]] in the religion on various themes and underscore a relationship of the Aqdas as a 'motherhood' in relation to all the other scriptural works and they to it. It also relates to scriptures of other religions by abrogation, explanation, affirmation or reformation &amp;mdash; an example of [[Progressive revelation (Bahá'í)|progressive revelation]] as a principle of the religion. While it is the core text on laws of the religion, it is not the exclusive source of laws in the religion, nor of Bahá'u'lláh's own writings, and complementarily the reader is told explicitly to not view the text as a "mere code of laws".&lt;ref name="JLR18-3"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schaefer |first=Udo |title=An Introduction to Baha'i Law: Doctrinal Foundations, Principles and Structures |journal=Journal of Law and Religion |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=307–372 |year=2002–2003 |jstor=1602268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kitáb-i-Aqdas was completed by Bahá'u'lláh in 1873. It was published in the Arabic for circulation among Bahá'ís speaking the language circa 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Christopher Buck |title=Symbol &amp; Secret |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xbVTViPK8JsC&amp;pg=PA19 |date=1 January 1995 |publisher=Kalimat Press |isbn=978-0-933770-80-5 |pages=19, 26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Russian translation was undertaken by [[Alexander Tumansky]] in 1899 and was his most important contribution to Bahá'í studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=TUMANSKIǏ, Aleksandr Grigor'evich |author=Jahangir Dorri |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Iranica |volume=online |date=15 August 2009 |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/tumanski-aleksandr-grigorevich |accessdate=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1900 an informal English translation was made by Bahá'í Anton Haddad, which circulated among the early American Bahá'í community in a typewritten form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Moojan Momen |title=Studies in the Bábí &amp; Bahá'í Religions |author=Loni Bramson-Lerche |chapter=Establishment of the Guardianship |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=cQK-kIlq2yYC&amp;pg=PA282 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cQK-kIlq2yYC |year=1988 |publisher=Kalimat Press |isbn=978-0-933770-72-0 |page=282}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, an English scholar of Arabic, Dr. Earl E.

== Content ==

The ''Kitáb-i-Aqdas'' is supplemented by the 
*"Questions and Answers"', which consists of 107 questions submitted to Bahá'u'lláh by [[Zaynu'l-Muqarrabin]] concerning the application of the laws and Bahá'u'lláh's replies to those questions
*"Some Texts Revealed by Bahá'u'lláh"
*''Synopsis and Codification of the Laws and Ordinances'', prepared by [[Shoghi Effendi]]
*explanatory notes prepared by the [[Universal House of Justice]]

The book was divided into six main themes in the ''Synopsis and Codification'' by Shoghi Effendi:
#The appointment of [['Abdu'l-Bahá]] as the successor of Bahá'u'lláh
#Anticipation of the Institution of the [[Guardian (Bahá'í Faith)|Guardianship]]
#The Institution of the Universal House of Justice
#Laws, Ordinances and exhortations
#Specific admonitions, reproofs and warnings
#Miscellaneous subjects

Further, the laws were divided into four categories:
:A. Prayer
:B. Fasting
:C. Laws of personal status
:D. Miscellaneous laws, ordinances and exhortations

===Themes===
Scholarly review finds the Aqdas has themes of laws of worship, societal relations and administrative organization, or governance, of the religion.&lt;ref name="JLR19-2"/&gt; Through the authority vested in [['Abdu'l-Bahá]] in the Aqdas there is an expanse of [[Cosmopolitanism|internationalism]] related to the law in works like ''[[The Secret of Divine Civilization]]'' and through his extended authority to [[Shoghi Effendi]] works like his ''[[World Order of Bahá'u'lláh]]'' further elaborates on the internationalism theme. This stands in some distinction from other scriptures by not using triumphal tones as the voice of God is given to be viewed but rather one of progressive development, social context, and outright delay in application until another day. Indeed, it insists that divine law is applicable only in situations with requisite conditions, where it is likely to have certain social effects. The goal of application of the law and its methods are not to cause disturbance and dissension and requires an appreciation for context and intention. Additionally one is to eschew emphasis in the development of [[textualist]] and [[intentionalist]] arguments about the law though some of this is visible in scholarship on the Aqdas. Such methods of application of law in a religious context are, in the opinion of Roshan Danish, common in Islam and Judaism.&lt;ref name="JLR19-2"/&gt;

The Aqdas is understood by Bahá'ís to be a factor in the process of ongoing developments in world order. This can be seen comparing the Bahá'í approach to history and the future to that of the theory of [[The Clash of Civilizations]] on the one hand and the development of a [[posthegemony]] system on the other (compared with work of Robert Cox, for example, in ''Approaches to World Order'', (Robert Cox &amp; Timonthy Sinclair eds, Cambridge University Press, 1996).)&lt;ref name="JLR19-2"/&gt;

Certain possible sources of law are specifically abrogated: laws of the Bábí religion, notably in the ''[[Persian Bayán]]'', oral traditions (linked with [[Bahá'í literature#Authenticity and authority|pilgrim notes]], and natural law, (that is to say God's sovereign will through revelation is the independent authority.)&lt;ref name="JLR18-3"/&gt; Divine revelation's law-making is both unconditioned in terms of the divine right to choose, and conditioned in the sense of the progress of history from one revelation to the next.&lt;ref name="JLR19-2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JLR18-3"/&gt;

====Laws of personal status====

=====Marriage and divorce=====
{{main|Bahá'í marriage}}
Baha'u'llah's statements about marriage in the ''Kitáb-i-Aqdas'' are brief. Marriage is highly recommended but is stated to not be obligatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Smith |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Smith (historian) |encyclopedia=A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title=marriage |year=2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location=Oxford |isbn=1-85168-184-1 |pages=232–234}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahá'u'lláh states that the maximum number of wives is two, but also states that having only one wife would add more tranquility to both partners.&lt;ref name="polygamy"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Smith |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Smith (historian) |encyclopedia=A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title=Polygamy |year=2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location=Oxford |isbn=1-85168-184-1 |pages=273}}&lt;/ref&gt; These statements were later interpreted by [['Abdu'l-Bahá]] that having a second wife is conditional upon treating both wives with justice and equality and was not possible in practice, thus establishing monogamy.&lt;ref name="polygamy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cambridge205"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Smith |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Smith (historian) |year=2008 |title=An Introduction to the Baha'i Faith |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-86251-5 |location=Cambridge |page=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JLR18-m"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schaefer |first=Udo |title=An Introduction to Baha'i Law: Doctrinal Foundations, Principles and Structures |journal=Journal of Law and Religion |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=321, 333 |year=2002–2003 |jstor=1602268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That [[Bahá'u'lláh]] had three wives,&lt;ref name="polygamy"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; while his religion teaches monogamy, which has been the subject of criticism. The writing of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas and Bahá'í teachings on gender equality and monogamy post-date Bahá'u'lláh's marriages and are understood to be evolutionary in nature, slowly leading Bahá'ís away from what had been a deeply rooted cultural practice.&lt;ref name="polygamy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JLR18-m"/&gt;

====Administration====
{{main|Bahá'í administration}}
The institutional status of the authority of 'Abdu'l-Bahá and a House of Justice are specifically delineated.&lt;ref name="JLR19-2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JLR18-3"/&gt; On the basis of the authority granted 'Abdu'l-Bahá he extended forms of the authority vested in him to the Guardianship, whose sole member was Shoghi Effendi, and the Universal, or International, House of Justice through his [[Will and Testament of `Abdu'l-Bahá|Will and Testament]]. This was confirmed and amplified in other texts, notably the [[Covenant of Bahá'u'lláh#Kit.C3.A1b-i-.60Ahd|Kitáb-i-'Ahd]]. The Universal House of Justice is specifically empowered to write and rescind any laws it is felt necessary aside from those of the text of scripture and actual application of the laws of the Aqdas among Bahá'ís are dependent on the choice of the Universal House of Justice.&lt;ref name="JLR18-3"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6648">'''Magis Institute''' is a non-profit educational organization founded by Jesuit priest and former [[Gonzaga University]] president [[Robert Spitzer, SJ|Robert J. Spitzer, SJ]].  The institute's primary outreaches are the [[Magis]] Center of Reason and Faith and the Magis Center for Catholic Spirituality.

== Founder ==
{{main|Robert Spitzer, SJ}}

'''Robert J. Spitzer''' [[Society of Jesus|S.J.]] (b. May 16, 1952) is a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[priest]], philosopher, educator, author, speaker, and retired President of [[Gonzaga University]] in [[Spokane, Washington]].   Father Spitzer is founder and currently active as President of Magis Institute, a non-profit organization dedicated to public education concerning the complementary relationship among the varied disciplines of physics, philosophy, reason, and faith.  He is also the Chief Education Officer of the Ethics and Performance Institute which delivers web-based ethics education to corporations and individuals. He is also President of the Spitzer Center of Ethical Leadership, which delivers similar curricula to non-profit organizations.

== The Magis Center for Reason and Faith ==
Magis Institute originally was created to be only a center for Catholic spirituality.  In 2008, Father Spitzer and his associates at Magis considered how they might offer a reasoned, scientific alternative viewpoint to those publicly expressed by "[[new atheism]]" writers such as [[Christopher Hitchins]] and [[Richard Dawkins]].  As a result of these conversations, Father Spitzer began the [http://magiscenter.com/ Magis Center for Reason and Faith] to provide a framework for the creation and distribution of materials expressing this alternative viewpoint.

On 3 September 2010, the Catholic News Agency featured Magis founder Father Spitzer in their response to the announcement of Stephen Hawking's new book touching on the subject of the origins of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;''Hawking's new book does not dismiss the real God from creation, Jesuit scholars say'' CNA, retrieved 8 Sept 2010 from http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/hawkings-new-book-does-not-dismiss-the-real-god-from-creation-jesuit-scholars-say/&lt;/ref&gt;  Online magazine "The Blaze" also featured a response to Hawking from Father Spitzer:  "There are already numerous video responses to Hawking popping up on YouTube. Let’s pick one.  Here is former Gonzaga University President Father Robert Spitzer who now heads the Magis Center of Reason and Faith"&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Scott.  ''Religious Leaders Respond to Hawking's 'No Need for God' ''The Blaze, 5 September 2010 retrieved on 8 September 2010 from http://www.theblaze.com/stories/religious-leaders-respond-to-hawkings-no-need-for-god-argument/&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 September 2010, the institute was prominently mentioned on the CNN program ''[[Larry King Live]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Transcript link: http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1009/10/lkl.01.html&lt;/ref&gt; Father Spitzer appeared as a panelist on the program which featured Dr. [[Stephen Hawking]], Hawking's literary collaborator, [[Leonard Mlodinow]], and author [[Deepak Chopra]] in a one-hour prime-time discussion on the need for a transcendent creator of the universe.

== Methods ==
The institute, through Magis Center for Reason and Faith, is using five methods to leverage media to publicize their view of the compatibility of faith and reason:

=== Books ===
Father Spitzer has published ''New Proofs for the Existence of God''&lt;ref&gt;Spitzer, Robert J, SJ. ''New Proofs for the Existence of God'' (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  The books authored by members of the institute will be "affordable (under $30.00 US for the most part) and tailored for the average reader within the planned demographic. The institute also helps to promote the books of other writers who share a similar viewpoint, e.g. William Lane Craig, working with a physicist named Simpson, published the ''Blackwell Commentary on Natural Theology''.&lt;ref&gt;Eds. Craig and Moreland.  ''The Blackwell Companion to Natural Theology'' (John Wiley and Sons, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Documentary films ===
The institute hired Martha Cotton, former producer of NBC News and the ''Today Show'', who has written a script that made these complex issues more intelligible, with the goal of bringing the discussion to the level of a high school student. Planned for a 2011 release, the first documentary features Nobel Laureate Arno Penzias, who discovered background radiation from the Big Bang. A Templeton Prize winner, John Polkinghorne, who is also an Anglican priest, is featured as well.  The feature is completed and distribution is being negotiated (as of March 2011).

=== New media ===
The institute is reaching out via the World Wide Web, and to the blogosphere; it has a popular Facebook page, and also releases frequent videos via YouTube.  The institute provides information concerning the long history of scientific research done by members of the clergy over the centuries with a special focus on those who are currently active in their respective fields both on Facebook and its website.

=== High school curriculum ===
The institute has planned the release in September 2011 of a curriculum aimed at the high school student, and designed for use in parochial schools and church youth groups..

=== Adult education and college curricula ===
Catalogued for the Fall (September) of 2011, there is a college course in conjunction with [[Benedictine College]] in Atchison, Kansas numbered GS298 and titled "Physics and Metaphysics in Dialogue". The course will carry 3 semester credits and will be transferable as elective credit to any regionally accredited institution of higher education.

Adult Curricula for group settings or individual study, with less scope and depth than the college course, are also to be released in September 2011.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8091">The '''marketplace of ideas''' is a rationale for [[freedom of expression]] based on an [[analogy]] to the [[economics|economic]] concept of a [[free market]]. The marketplace of ideas holds that the [[truth]] will emerge from the competition of ideas in free, transparent public discourse, and concludes that ideas and ideologies will be culled according to their superiority or inferiority and widespread acceptance among the population. The concept is often applied to discussions of [[patent law]] as well as [[freedom of the press]] and the responsibilities of the media in a [[liberal democracy]].

The marketplace of ideas [[metaphor]] is founded in the philosophy of [[John Milton]] in his work "[[Areopagitica]]" in 1644 and also [[John Stuart Mill]]  in his book, ''[[On Liberty]]'' in 1859.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ingber |first1=Stanley |title=The Marketplace of Ideas: A Legitimizing Myth |journal=Duke Law Journal |date=February 1984 |issue=1 |page=3 |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/fa1b/c9ef33f67d03637b24dad1b305a6a7b937b9.pdf |accessdate=27 November 2018 |format=PDF |quote=... this classic image of competing ideas and robust debate dates back to English philosophers John Milton and John Stuart Mill ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later used in opinions by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. The first reference to the "free trade in ideas" within "the competition of the market" appears in Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]]'s dissent in ''[[Abrams v. United States]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Abrams v. United States]]'', 250 U.S. 616, 630 (1919)&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase "marketplace of ideas" first appears in a concurring opinion by Justice [[William O. Douglas]] in the Supreme Court decision ''[[United States v. Rumely]]'' in 1953: "Like the publishers of newspapers, magazines, or books, this publisher bids for the minds of men in the market place of ideas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=First Amendment Fellow |url=http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/holmes%E2%80%99-idea-marketplace-%E2%80%93-its-origins-legacy |title=Holmes’ idea marketplace – its origins &amp; legacy &amp;#124; First Amendment Center – news, commentary, analysis on free speech, press, religion, assembly, petition |publisher=Firstamendmentcenter.org |date=2010-05-13 |accessdate=2014-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court's 1969 decision in ''[[Brandenburg v. Ohio]]'' enshrined the marketplace of ideas as the dominant public policy in [[Freedom of speech in the United States|American free speech law]] (that is, against which narrow exceptions to freedom of speech must be justified by specific countervailing public policies). While the previous cases dealt with natural persons,{{fact|date=September 2018}} the 1976 decision ''[[Virginia State Pharmacy Board v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council]]'' expanded it to corporations by creating a curtailed corporate commercial speech right, striking down a government regulation of advertising in the process.&lt;ref name="WeTheCorporations"&gt;{{Cite book |title=We the Corporations: How American Businesses Won Their Civil Rights |last=Winkler |first=Adam |publisher=Liveright |year=2018 |isbn=978-0871407122}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has not been seriously questioned since in United States jurisprudence,{{fact|date=September 2018}} but the legacy of those decisions have lead to subsequent decisions like ''[[Citizens United v. FEC]]'' that curtailed the government's ability to regulate corporate speech&lt;ref name="WeTheCorporations"/&gt; and much more expansive advertising campaigns, commercial and political, than Americans had experienced previously.&lt;ref name="Adcreep"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Adcreep: The Case Against Modern Marketing |last=Bartholomew |first=Mark |publisher=Stanford Law Books |year=2017 |isbn=978-0804795814}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The general idea that free speech should be tolerated because it will lead toward the truth has a long history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1691952 "How Much Does a Belief Cost? Revisiting the Marketplace of Ideas"], Gregory Brazeal, ''Southern California Interdisciplinary Law Journal'', vol. 21 no. 1, pp. 2–10 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; The English poet [[John Milton]] suggested that restricting speech was not necessary because "in a free and open encounter", truth would prevail.&lt;ref&gt;John Milton, ''Areopagitica'', in ''Areopagitica and Of Education'' 1, 50 (Harlan Davidson, Inc. 1951) [1644].&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. President [[Thomas Jefferson]] argued that it is safe to tolerate "error of opinion ... where reason is left free to combat it".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Jefferson, ''First Inaugural Address'' (Mar. 4, 1801), in ''Writings'' 492, 493 (Merrill D. Peterson ed. 1984).&lt;/ref&gt; Fredrick Siebert echoed the idea that free expression is self-correcting in ''Four Theories of the Press'': "Let all with something to say be free to express themselves. The true and sound will survive. The false and unsound will be vanquished. Government should keep out of the battle and not weigh the odds in favor of one side or the other."&lt;ref&gt;Siebert, Fred S. [https://books.google.com/books?id=4Q-oePDdcC8C&amp;pg=PA45&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;dq=siebert+%22true+and+sound%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=F20MjjnSpZ&amp;sig=7yvt6AILK4WtDh9aSTKF8iMjaLw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=UShsTJKDMoP7lwedorDyAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=true%20and%20sound&amp;f=false "The Libertarian Theory"] in Fred S. Siebert, Theodore Peterson, and Wilbur Schramm's ''Four Theories of the Press: The Authoritarian, Libertarian, Social Responsibility, and Soviet Communist Concepts of What the Press Should Be and Do'', p. 45. Chicago: University of Illinois Press. (1963).&lt;/ref&gt; These writers did not rely on the economic analogy to a market.

If beliefs such as [[religion]]s are considered as ideas, the marketplace of ideas concept favors a marketplace of religions rather than forcing a state religion or forbidding incompatible beliefs. In this sense, it provides a rationale for [[freedom of religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ullman Chiswick|first=Carmel|title=Competition vs. Monopoly in the Religious Marketplace: Judaism in the United States and Israel|url=http://ftp.iza.org/dp7188.pdf|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years questions have arisen regarding the existence of markets in ideas. Several scholars have noted differences between the way ideas are produced and consumed and the way more traditional goods are produced and consumed.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1691952 ''How Much Does a Belief Cost? Revisiting the Marketplace of Ideas''], Gregory Brazeal, ''Southern California Interdisciplinary Law Journal'', vol. 21 no. 1, p. 1 (2011); ''The Competition of Ideas: Market or Garden?'', Robert Sparrow &amp; Robert Goodin, Critical Review of International Social and Political Philosophy, vol. 4 no. 2, p. 45 (2001); ''Speech, Truth, and the Free Market for Ideas'', Alvin I. Goldman &amp; James C. Cox, Legal Theory, vol. 2, p. 1 (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been argued that the idea of the marketplace of ideas as applied to religion "incorrectly assumes a level playing field" among religions.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', Makau Mutua, [http://www.manushi-india.org/pdfs_issues/PDF%20Files%20150/Sankrant%20Sanu.%204-12.pdf ''Facilitating Freedom of Religion or Belief, A Deskbook.'']&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the idea of a marketplace of ideas has been applied to the study of scientific research as a social institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uned.es/dpto_log/jpzb/abstracts.html#The_economics_of_scientific_knowledge |title=Jesús Zamora Bonilla &amp;#124; Dpto.

[[File:Catherine Ann Drinker (Janvier), Blessed are the Meek, 1871, three-color lithograph, Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.jpg|thumb|[[Catherine Ann Drinker]] (Janvier), ''Blessed are the Meek'', 1871[[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]]]]
'''Meekness''' is an attribute of human nature and behavior. It has been defined several ways: [[Righteousness|righteous]], [[Humility|humble]], teachable, and [[Patience|patient under suffering]], long suffering&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/meekness The Free Dictionary, ''Meekness'']&lt;/ref&gt; willing to follow gospel teachings; an attribute of a true disciple.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/gs/meek-meekness?lang=eng&amp;letter=m LDS.org Guide to the Scriptures, ''meekness'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/ensign/1983/03/meekness-a-dimension-of-true-discipleship?lang=eng Neal A. Maxwell, Meekness -- A Dimension of True Discipleship, 1982]&lt;/ref&gt;

Meekness has been contrasted with humility as referring to behavior towards others, whereas humility refers to an attitude towards oneself&lt;ref&gt;E. A. Cochran, ''Receptive Human Virtues'' (2011) p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; – meekness meaning restraining one's own power,&lt;ref name="Henry"&gt;Matthew (1806). ''A Discourse Concerning Meekness.'' Hilliard&lt;/ref&gt; so as to allow room for others.&lt;ref&gt;K. D. Bassett, ''Doctrinal Insight to the Book of Mormon'' (2008) p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity==
*The Israelite Apostle Paul gave an example of meek behavior when writing to Timothy: "The servant of the Lord must be gentle, apt to teach, patient, in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves." ([[Second Epistle to Timothy|2 Tim.]] 2:24–25)
*[[Thomas Browne|Sir Thomas Browne]] explained: "Meekness takes injuries like pills, not chewing, but swallowing them down." This indicates that meekness allows a person to overlook or forgive perceived insults or offenses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/meekness The Free Dictionary, ''Usages of meekness'']&lt;/ref&gt;
*The meek feature in the [[Beatitudes]], and were linked thereby to the classical virtue of [[magnanimity]] by [[Aquinas]].&lt;ref&gt;C. S. Titus, ''Resilience and the Virtue of Fortitude'' (2006) p. 320&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===
*A meek behavior is presented as being opposite to "the natural man" (i.e. one who acts strictly according to desires of the body): 'Put off the natural man and become meek.' ([[Book of Mormon]], Mosiah 3:19), and in 3 Nephi 12:5 when Jesus Christ appears to the people of ancient America after his Ascension to Heaven and teaches them the beatitudes.

*LDS Apostle Elder David A. Bednar said in April 2018, "Meekness is a defining attribute of the Redeemer and is distinguished by righteous responsiveness, willing submissiveness, and strong self-restraint." He further said, "Whereas humility generally denotes dependence upon God and the constant need for His guidance and support, a distinguishing characteristic of meekness is a particular spiritual receptivity to learning both from the Holy Ghost and from people who may seem less capable, experienced, or educated, who may not hold important positions, or who otherwise may not appear to have much to contribute."&lt;ref&gt;David A. Bednar (April 2018). [https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2018/04/meek-and-lowly-of-heart?lang=eng "Meek and Lowly of Heart"]. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
*[[Beethoven]] rejected meekness and equality in favor of cultural [[elitism]]: “''Power'' is the moral principle of those who excel others”.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Maynard Solomon, ''Beethoven Essays'' (1988) p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Nietzsche]] rejected Christian meekness as part of a parasitic revolt by the low against the lofty, the manly, and the high.&lt;ref&gt;W. Kaufman ed., ''The Portable Nietzsche'' (1987) p. 626-30&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other traditions==
*[[Buddhism]], like Christianity, strongly values meekness&lt;ref&gt;J. B. Carman, ''Majesty and Meekness'' (1994) p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; – the Buddha himself (in an earlier life) featuring as the 'Preacher of Meekness' who patiently had his limbs lopped off by a jealous king without complaining.&lt;ref&gt;D. Schlinghoff, ''Studies in the Ajanta Paintings'' (1987) p. 219&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Taoism]] valorized the qualities of submission and non-contention.&lt;ref&gt;D. C. Lau ed., ''Lao Tzu'' (1963) p. 25-9&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Book of Numbers]] chapter 12 verse 3: Now the man [[Moses]] was very meek, above all the men which were upon the face of the earth.
* In [[Islam]], faqr, sometimes translated as "''poverty''", is one of the central attitudes in a  [[Faqeer]]. It was also one of the attributes of the Prophet. He said "faqr is my pride". In a spiritual sense, faqr is defined as the absence of desire for wealth, recognition or for the blessings of the otherworld. One of the aspects of one who has embodied the true essence of faqr, is that the mystic will never ask anything of anyone else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mystical Dimensions of Islam |author=Annemarie Schimmel |page=121 |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |orig-year=1975 |format=reprint |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-8078-9976-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this is for one to ask someone else for anything they would be relying on a created being. To receive something from that same being would produce gratitude in the heart which would be geared toward the giver, not towards God.&lt;ref name= Faqr&gt;Khadim Sultan-ul-Faqr, Mohammad Najib-ur-Rehman (2015). [https://books.google.com/books?id=hlyMAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA145&amp;dq=what+is+faqr&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=what%20is%20faqr&amp;f=false ''Sultan Bahoo: The Life and Teachings''], page 145. Sultan-ul-Faqr Publications, Lahore. {{isbn|978-969-9795-18-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animal analogues==
*The classical Greek word used to translate meekness was that for a horse that had been tamed and bridled.&lt;ref&gt;J. K. Bergland, ''The Journeys of Robert Williams'' ( 2010) p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;
*The buffalo was to the Buddhists a lesson in meekness.&lt;ref&gt;D. Schlinghoff, ''Studies in the Ajanta Paintings'' (1987) p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary examples==
*Meekness is used to characterise the nature of Tess in [[Tess of the D'Urbervilles]].&lt;ref&gt;H. Bloom, ''Thomas Hardy'' (2010) p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Heroine of ''[[Possession (novel)|Possession: A Romance]]'' judges the hero as "a gentle and unthreatening being. Meek, she thought drowsily, turning out the light. Meek."&lt;ref&gt;A. S. Byatt, ''Possession: A Romance'' (1991) p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mirari vos''''' - Latin: I was surprised - (On Liberalism and Religious Indifferentism), sometimes referred to as '''''Mirari vos arbitramur''''', is the first [[Papal Encyclical|encyclical]] of [[Pope Gregory XVI]] and was issued in August 1832.  Addressed "To All Patriarchs, Primates, Archbishops, and Bishops of the Catholic World", it is general in scope.

==Background==
[[Hugues Felicité Robert de Lamennais|Felicité Robert de Lamennais]], [[Charles Forbes René de Montalembert]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Henri Lacordaire]] started a newspaper, ''L'Avenir'' ("The Future"). While the paper was a strong proponent of [[Ultramontanism]], supporting the authority of the papacy in opposition to nationalist and secularist ideas, it also advocated an enlarged suffrage, separation of church and state, and universal freedom of conscience, instruction, assembly, and the press. They saw no conflict between Catholicism and liberal reform. The conservative French hierarchy regarded such views as dangerous nonsense. In November 1831, Lammennais and Montalembert traveled to [[Rome]], seeking confirmation from Pope Gregory that views expressed in their newspaper were orthodox.

Although pressured by the French government and the French hierarchy, [[Pope Gregory XVI]] would have preferred not to make an official issue of the matter.&lt;ref name=cook&gt;[https://www.ohio.edu/chastain/ip/lamann.htm Bernard, Cook. "Lamennais, Hugues-Felicité Robert de (1782-1854)", ''Encyclopedia of 1848 Revolutions'', (James Chastain, ed.), Ohio University, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; After much opposition, they gained an audience on March 15, 1832, only on condition that their political views should not be mentioned. The meeting was apparently cordial and uneventful. [[Klemens von Metternich]], whose Austrian troops ensured the stability of the Papal States, pressed for a condemnation.&lt;ref name=owen&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xtbLJZOKxx8C&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;dq=Singulari+Nos&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-NiMTwLNwx&amp;sig=LFTMJ0M5z-1cTIdbK7NME2T7whg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwihvtST-aHJAhXL1B4KHe4BBxQ4ChDoAQhLMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=Singulari%20Nos&amp;f=false Chadwick, Owen. "Gregory XVI", ''A History of the Popes, 1830-1914'', Oxford University Press, 2003] {{ISBN|9780199262861}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pope's advisors were convinced that if he said nothing, it would viewed that he did not disapprove of Lamennais's opinions. ''Mirari vos'' was issued the following August, criticizing Lamennais's views without mentioning him by name.&lt;ref name=owen/&gt;

==Content== 
He voiced support for Christian freedom, upheld the ecclesiastical supremacy of the papacy and raised concerns over alliances that were too close between the clergy and government. It denounced those who advocated a married clergy: "We ask that you strive with all your might to justify and to defend the law of clerical celibacy as prescribed by the sacred canons, against which the arrows of the lascivious are directed from every side."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.papalencyclicals.net/greg16/g16mirar.htm Pope Gregory XVI, ''Mirari vos'', §11, Rome, August 15, 1832]&lt;/ref&gt; He also denounced those who advocated divorce{{sfn|Mirari vos, §12}} and secret societies that sought overturn the legitimate governments of the Italian states.&lt;ref name=owen/&gt;

He attacked religious [[indifferentism]], which was defined as the opinion that one religion is as good as another, which he saw as the basis for the argument for liberty of conscience. He saw it as the state's duty to restrain the promotion of false truth, which leads to immorality and so denounced freedom to publish or distribute any writings indiscriminately. Owen Chadwick explains Gregory's perspective: "To provide legally that writers or speakers shall be free to promote what is not true or to utter words that declare that racial prejudice, or paederasty, or pornography, or adultery, or murder not to be sins, cannot be what God demands of any State.{{sfn|Chadwick, p. 25}}

He stated, &lt;blockquote&gt;"Some are so carried away that they contentiously assert that the flock of errors arising from them is sufficiently compensated by the publication of some book which defends religion and truth. Every law condemns deliberately doing evil simply because there is some hope that good may result. Is there any sane man who would say poison ought to be distributed, sold publicly, stored, and even drunk because some antidote is available and those who use it may be snatched from death again and again?{{sfn|Morari vos, §15}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The encyclical satisfied neither Lamennais's supporters nor his detractors.&lt;ref name=owen/&gt;

To be '''multifaith''' is to feel an affinity with aspects of more than one [[religion]], [[philosophy]] or [[world-view]], and perhaps to [[belief|believe]] that no one is superior to the others. This term should not be confused with [[interfaith]], which concerns the communication between different religions.

This is inherent to [[Relativism]] but exists among followers of other religions such as [[Confucianism]] and the [[Bahá'í Faith]], as well as followers of the more liberal currents within [[Christianity]], [[Islam]] and [[Judaism]].

== Relativism ==

Relativism centers on the belief that the best way to honour a divine creator is through the accomplishment of good actions, defined as those motivated by respect and empathy, and that no bad actions can ever be justified in the name of religion. Other religions are considered equally capable of providing a motivation to do good for those who understand them, or to do evil while claiming to do good for those who misinterpret them. 

The term "Relativism" in a religious sense derives from the belief that each individual brings their own wisdom, personality, cultural background and experience to bear on their interpretation of a religion. 

Relativism is open to criticism by the more [[orthodoxy|orthodox]] followers of other religions. In April 2005, in his [[homily]] during [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] prior to the conclave which would elect him as Pope, the then [[Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger]] talked about the world "moving towards a dictatorship of Relativism".

{{nihongo|'''Noro'''|祝女, sometimes 神女 or 巫女}} ([[Okinawan language|Okinawan]]: Nuuru) are [[priest]]esses of the [[Ryukyuan religion]] at [[Utaki]]. They have existed since at least the beginning of the [[History of the Ryukyu Islands#Gusuku Period|Gusuku Period]] (late 12th century) and continue to perform rituals even today. They are distinct from ''{{ill|yuta (priestess)|lt=yuta|ja|ユタ}}'' (psychics), but are classified as ''kaminchu'' ("godly people").

==History==
According to ''[[Chūzan Seikan]]'' and ''[[Chūzan Seifu]]'', the first priestesses were the daughters of Tentei-shi, who was a descendant of the creation goddess, [[Amamikyu]]. The first daughter became the first royal priestess, [[kikoe-ōgimi]] ({{lang|ja|聞得大君}}), and the second daughter became the first village priestess, noro.&lt;ref&gt;George H. Kerr, ''Okinawa: History of an Island People'' (Tokyo: Charles E. Tuttle Company, 1958), 36.&lt;/ref&gt; The god of fire gave a piece of fire from [[Ryūgū-jō]] to each noro to create a village hearth, from which each family in the village would take fire to maintain their own family hearths.&lt;ref&gt;George H. Kerr, ''Okinawa: History of an Island People'' (Tokyo: Charles E. Tuttle Company, 1958), 36.&lt;/ref&gt; The kikoe-ōgimi maintained the royal hearth. The noro were charged with conducting official rituals and ceremonies for their respective village. The kikoe-ōgimi was charged with conducting rituals and ceremonies on behalf of the entire kingdom, and traveled with the king to [[Sefa-utaki]] to worship Amamikyu.

Upon taking the throne in 1469, King [[Shō En]] made his sister the Chief Noro of his home of [[Izena, Okinawa|Izena]], and his daughter kikoe-ōgimi.&lt;ref&gt;George H. Kerr, ''Okinawa: History of an Island People'' (Tokyo: Charles E. Tuttle Company, 1958), 103-104.&lt;/ref&gt; During the reign of [[Shō Shin]] (r. 1477–1526), the priestess system was centralized under the kikoe-ōgimi's authority and a noro was assigned to every village in the kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;George H. Kerr, ''Okinawa: History of an Island People'' (Tokyo: Charles E. Tuttle Company, 1958), 110.&lt;/ref&gt; The kikoe-ōgimi also had a new residence built near [[Shuri Castle]] so she could maintain [[Sonohyan-utaki]].&lt;ref&gt;George H. Kerr, ''Okinawa: History of an Island People'' (Tokyo: Charles E. Tuttle Company, 1958), 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1609 [[Invasion of Ryukyu|invasion by Satsuma]], Confucian thought entered the Ryukyuan government and began eroding the authority of the priestesses. Satsuma placed a demand on the Ryukyuan government that women were forbidden to own land, however the government ignored this demand in respect to the noro. [[Shō Shōken]], acting as Prime Minister of Ryukyu, convinced the king to stop or scale down a number of religious rituals and ceremonies in the name of saving money and minimizing aspects of Ryukyuan culture that might seem "backwards" to Satsuma, such as the king and kikoe-ōgimi's pilgrimage to Sefa-utaki. However, local village priestesses still retained influence and power until the end of the 19th century.

After Japan annexed the Ryukyu Kingdom in 1879, the Meiji government began attempts at absorbing the Ryukyuan religion into [[State Shinto]]. The priestesses and their shrines were co-opted by the government and registered. The noro were prohibited from being recognized as part of the Shinto priesthood and, unlike their Shinto counterparts, were not guaranteed protection by the state. Furthermore, the government abolished their salaries. While the government was unable to confiscate noro land, in 1910 their land were commuted to monetary stipends which were then limited in use to exclude personal expense, leaving the noro with no government income. Then-Governor of Okinawa Prefecture [[Hibi Shigeaki]] stated that this limitation on the use of noro land stipends was "for the maintenance of noro lands... for their eventual reclassification into [Shinto] shrines."&lt;ref&gt;Tze May Loo, ''Heritage Politics: Shuri Castle and Okinawa's Incorporation into Modern Japan'' (New York: Lexington Books, 2014), 102.&lt;/ref&gt; As the influence of noro declined, the popularity of yuta increased.

The chaos of the [[Battle of Okinawa]] severely reduced and scattered Okinawa's population, which further minimized the function of the noro. Noro today only exist in rural villages and at [[utaki]] sites.

==Kikoe-ōgimi==

The kikoe-ōgimi served as the priestess for the Ryukyu Kingdom and the royal family. She conducted national ceremonies, oversaw all other noro priestesses, and maintained the royal hearth and the most sacred utaki.&lt;ref&gt;George H. Kerr, ''Okinawa: History of an Island People'' (Tokyo: Charles E. Tuttle Company, 1958), 110-111.&lt;/ref&gt; The inauguration ceremony, ''uarauri'' ({{lang|ja|御新下り}}), of a new kikoe-ōgimi was held at Seifa-utaki. The ceremony represented the holy marriage between Amamikyu and Shinerikyu. Religiously, the holy marriage gave the kikoe-ōgimi spiritual power supported by ''[[kimitezuri]]'' ({{lang|ja|君手摩}}). After she was inaugurated, she stayed in the position until her death. The position was abolished along with the kingdom in 1879, however the last kikoe-ōgimi continued her role until her death in 1944.

==Noro duties and responsibilities==

As mentioned above, noro were responsible for maintaining the village hearth and helping to establish new households.&lt;ref&gt;George H. Kerr, ''Okinawa: History of an Island People'' (Tokyo: Charles E. Tuttle Company, 1958), 32.&lt;/ref&gt; They primarily conducted rituals and ceremonies for their respective village at a local utaki. Girls from each family in a village are assigned to be the noro's assistant, although men can also be assistants for public ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Sered, ''Women of the Sacred Grove: Divine Priestesses of Okinawa'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999), 3-4, 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Noro also communicate with and channel ancestors and deities.

==Symbols==

Noro are most recognizable by their white robes and headdress, which symbolize spiritual purity.&lt;ref&gt;George H. Kerr, ''Okinawa: History of an Island People'' (Tokyo: Charles E. Tuttle Company, 1958), 33.&lt;/ref&gt; They also wear or carry beads and a [[magatama]] stone. The noro's hearth includes three stones teepee-ed together; the stones always come from the shore.&lt;ref&gt;George H. Kerr, ''Okinawa: History of an Island People'' (Tokyo: Charles E. Tuttle Company, 1958), 32-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Zusters in Sevilla.JPG|thumb|A novice is at left. The habit of a novice often differs from that of the full professed monks.]]
The '''novitiate''', also called the '''noviciate''', is the period of training and preparation that a Christian ''[[novice]]'' (or ''prospective'') [[monk|monastic]], apostolic, or member of a [[religious order]] undergoes prior to taking [[Religious vows|vows]] in order to [[Discernment|discern]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; whether he or she is [[Religious calling|called]] to vowed religious life. It often includes times of intense study, [[Christian prayer|prayer]], living in community, studying the vowed life, deepening one's relationship with God, and deepening one's self-awareness. It is a time of creating a new way of being in the world. The novitiate stage in most communities is a two-year period of formation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Canon Law]] 653.1&lt;/ref&gt; These years are "Sabbath time" to deepen one's relationship with God, to intensify the living out of the community's mission and charism, and to foster human growth. The novitiate experience for many communities includes a concentrated program of prayer, study, reflection and limited ministerial engagement.

Novices are not admitted to [[monastic vows|vows]] until they have successfully completed the prescribed period of training and proving, called the novitiate. In the [[Middle Ages]] novices typically would have dormitories in separate areas within a [[monastery]]; an early [[Cistercian]] monastery, [[Royal Monastery of Our Lady of the Wheel]], founded in 1202, has this chamber clearly visible today.

Earlier, different orders followed their own rules governing the length and conditions of the novitiate. At the time of the [[Reformation]], the [[Council of Trent]] legislated the length and conditions by which anyone aspiring to become a [[monk]] is obliged to be a novice; the usual period is at least one year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11144a.htm|title=Novice|work=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; depending on the [[aptitude]] of the [[candidate]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;The novitiate, through which life in an institute is begun, is arranged so that the novices better understand their divine vocation, and indeed one which is proper to the institute, experience the manner of living of the institute, and form their mind and heart in its spirit, and so that their intention and suitability are tested.
:—Canon Law 646&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Conscious of their own responsibility, the Novices are to collaborate actively with their Director in such a way that they faithfully respond to the grace of a divine vocation.
:—Canon Law 652.3&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Members of the institute are to take care that they cooperate for their part in the work of formation of the Novices through example of life and prayer
:—Canon Law 652.3&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Novices are to be led to cultivate human and Christian virtues; through prayer and self denial they are to be introduced to a fuller way of perfection; they are to be taught to contemplate the mystery of salvation and to read and meditate on the sacred scriptures; they are to be prepared to cultivate the worship of God in the sacred liturgy; they are to learn a manner of leading a life consecrated to God and humanity in Christ through the evangelical counsels; they are to be instructed regarding the character and spirit, the purpose and discipline, the history and life of the institute; and they are to be imbued with love for the Church.
:—Canon Law 652&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A novice is free to quit the novitiate at any time, and the Novice Director, Formation Director, or [[superior (hierarchy)|Superior]] is free to dismiss him or her with or without cause in most communities.

Often, in novicating, the vows are continuous through training.

In some novitiate communities, mostly monastic, the novice often wears clothing that is distinct from secular dress but is not the full [[Religious habit|habit]] worn by [[Profession (religious)|professed]] members of the community. The novice's day normally encompasses participation in the full [[canonical hours]], manual labor, and classes designed to instruct novices in the religious life he is preparing to embrace. Spiritual exercises and tests of humility are common features of a novitiate. Some [[Roman Catholic]] communities encourage frequent [[Confession (religion)|confession]] and reception of [[Holy Communion]] by their novices.

A Superior will often appoint an experienced member of the community to oversee the training of novices. This may be a Finally Professed Member, [[novice master]] or mistress who is responsible for the training of all novices.

Different religious communities will have varying requirements for the duration of the novitiate. Often one must complete a [[postulant|postulancy]] before officially entering the novitiate. In many apostolic religious communities in the United States, postulancy or candidacy is one to three years. In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the novitiate is officially set at three years before one may be [[tonsure]]d a monk or nun, though this requirement may be [[Economy (Eastern Orthodox Church)|waived]].

The term "novitiate" also refers to the building, house, or complex within a [[monastery]] or [[convent]] that is devoted exclusively to the needs of novices (sleeping, training, etc.).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="955">The '''Orebites''' ({{lang-cz|Orebité}}) were followers of the [[Hussites]] in Eastern Bohemia.  The founders took part in the procession on Mount [[Oreb (hill)|Oreb]] near  [[Třebechovice pod Orebem]].  Later most of the noble supporters belonged to the East Bohemian church known as the ''[[Bohemian Brethren]]''.  The ideological founder of the Orebites was a priest named [[Ambrož Hradecký]].  Leaders included [[Hynek Krušina of Lichtenburg]] and [[Diviš Bořek of Miletínek]], captain of the Hussites in Eastern and Central Bohemia.  The Orebites were instrumental in the burning of the Benedictine monastery in [[Mnichovo Hradiště]] in the early summer of 1420, and in the autumn of that year they supported the rest of the Hussites at the [[Battle of Vyšehrad]].  In 1423 they merged with the ''[[Sirotci]]'' of [[Jan Žižka]].

A part of the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]], '''''prorrhesis''''' was the official announcement of the start of the rites.  This announcement occurred on the 15th day of [[Boedromion]] (September), and was given by the [[hierophant]]es.

'''Rangfarah''' is the name chosen for a revivalist movement of [[Tangsa]] traditional spirituality. The intention is "to give an alternative form of religious belief to those who were neither following the Christian beliefs nor the traditional ways". "Rangfrah" meaning "God" in the [[Longchang]] dialect was given a form very similar to that of the "[[Shiva]]" of the Hindu religion and a worshiping house called "Rangshom Him" was built to place the Rangfrah idol and make arrangement for the followers to gather and offer their prayers.

In the dialects of other [[Tangsa]] communities, the term for "God" takes variants such as Rangwa, Rangkhothak, etc. Traditionally, the Tangsas rarely practiced any kind of religious rituals dedicated to the God. However, they generally used various ways to invoke spirits to either receive their benevolent influences or to protect themselves from their malevolent activities. The rituals were mostly invocations, which predominantly involved offerings of animals, rice, rice-beer, eggs, etc. wrapped in leaves of a particular plant and then placing them at a sacred location specific to that particular ritual.

The relationship between '''religion and divorce''' is complicated and varied. This article attempts to summarize the dominant views in a number of major world faiths.

Boni de Castellane then sought an annulment from the [[Holy See|Vatican]] so that he could be free to remarry in the Church. The annulment case was not finally settled until 1924, when the highest Vatican tribunal upheld the validity of the marriage and denied the annulment.

The great majority of [[Christian denominations]] affirm that marriage is intended as a lifelong covenant, but vary in their response to its dissolubility through divorce. The [[Roman Catholic Church]] treats all [[consummate]]d [[Sacraments|sacramental]] marriages as permanent during the life of the spouses, and therefore does not allow remarriage after a divorce if the other spouse still lives and the marriage has not been [[Annulment (Catholic Church)|annulled]]. However, divorced Catholics are still welcome to participate fully in the life of the church so long as they have not remarried against church law, and the Catholic Church generally requires civil divorce or annulment procedures to have been completed before it will consider annulment cases. Annulment is not the same as divorce - it is a declaration that the marriage was never valid to begin with.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;''Divorce in Christianity'' at [http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/ritesrituals/divorce_1.shtml www.bbc.co.uk] retrieved 17 Aug 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Other Christian denominations, including the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and many [[Protestant]] churches, will allow both divorce and remarriage even with a surviving former spouse, at least under certain conditions. For example, the [[Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection]], in its 2014 Discipline, teaches:&lt;ref name="AWMC2014"/&gt;
{{quotation|We believe that the only legitimate marriage is the joining of one man and one woman (Gen. 2:24; Rom. 7:2; 1 Cor. 7:10; Eph. 5:22, 23). We deplore the evils of divorce and remarriage. We regard adultery as the only scripturally justifiable grounds for divorce; and the party guilty of adultery has by his or her act forfeited membership in the church. In the case of divorce for other cause, neither party shall be permitted to marry again during the lifetime of the other; and violation of this law shall be punished by expulsion from the church (Matt. 5:32; Mark 10:11, 12). In the carrying out of these principles, guilt shall be established in accordance with judicial procedures set forth in ''The Discipline''.&lt;ref name="AWMC2014"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Discipline of the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection (Original Allegheny Conference)|year=2014|publisher=[[Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection]]|location=[[Salem, Ohio|Salem]]|language=English|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In societies that practised [[Puritan]]ism, divorce was allowed if one partner in the marriage was not completely satisfied with the other, and remarriage was also allowed. The [[Church of England]] also took an indissolublist line until 2002, when it agreed to allow a divorced person to remarry in church under exceptional circumstances.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

Bible commentary on divorce comes primarily from the gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and the epistles of Paul. [[Expounding of the Law#Divorce|Jesus taught on the subject of divorce]] in three of the [[Gospels]], and Paul gives a rather extensive treatment of the subject in his [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]] chapter 7: "Let not the wife depart from her husband...let not the husband put away his wife" (1 Corinthians 7:10-11), but he also includes the [[Pauline privilege]].  He again alludes to his position on divorce in his [[Epistle to the Romans]], albeit an allegory, when he states "For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth. . . . So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress" (Romans 7:2-3).

In {{bibleverse||Matthew|5:31-32|KJV}}, {{bibleverse||Matthew|19:1-10|KJV}} and {{bibleverse||Mark|10:1-5|KJV}}, Jesus came into conflict with the [[Pharisees]] over divorce concerning their well-known controversy between [[Hillel the Elder|Hillel]] and [[Shammai]] about {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|24:1-4|KJV}}—as evidenced in [[Nashim]] Gittin 9:10 of the [[Mishnah]]. Do Jesus’ answers to the Pharisees also pertain to Christians? Are Christians who adopt these teachings [[Judaizers]]? The differences in opinions about these questions usually arise over whether Jesus [[Antinomianism|opposed the Law of Moses]] or just some of the viewpoints of the Pharisees, and whether Jesus just addressed a [[Jewish Christians|Jewish audience]] or expanded his audience to include Christians, for example "all nations" as in the [[Great Commission]].    
Since Deuteronomy 24:1-4 did not give Jewish women the right to directly initiate a divorce (See ''[[Agunah]]''), did Jesus' answers "in the house" to his disciples expand the rights of women or did they merely acknowledge that some Jewish women, such as [[Herodias]] who divorced Herod Boethus, were wrongfully taking rights because Jewish women were being assimilated by other cultures? (See {{bibleverse||Matthew|14:3-4|KJV}}, {{bibleverse||Mark|10:10-12|KJV}}.) In other words, did Jesus confine his remarks to the Pharisaical questions, and did he appeal to his own authority by refuting the oral authority of the Pharisees with the formula [[Expounding of the Law|"You have heard...But I say to you"]] in {{bibleverse||Matthew|5:20-48|KJV}}? Expressions used by Jesus such as "you have heard", "it hath been said", "it is written", "have you never read", "keep the commandments", "why do you break the commandments with your traditions?" and "what did Moses Command you?" seem to indicate that Jesus generally respected the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]] and sometimes opposed [[Oral law|Pharisaical Opinions]]. He was [[Woes of the Pharisees|critical of the Pharisees]].

==Buddhism==
Buddhism has no religious concept of marriage (see [[Buddhist view of marriage]]). In Buddhism, marriage is a secular affair, subject to local customs.

==Islam==
{{main|Divorce in Islam}}
{{See also|Sharia}}

According to the Quran, marriage is intended to be unbounded in time, but when marital harmony cannot be attained, the Quran allows the spouses to bring the marriage to an end (2:231).&lt;ref name=EoQ-279&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|author=Harald Motzki | year= 2006 | title=Marriage and divorce|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of the Qurʾān|editor=Jane Dammen McAuliffe|volume=3|page=279|publisher=Brill}}&lt;/ref&gt; Divorce in Islam can take a variety of forms, some initiated by the husband and some initiated by the wife. The main traditional legal categories are ''talaq'' (repudiation), ''khulʿ'' (mutual divorce), judicial divorce and oaths. The theory and practice of divorce in the Islamic world have varied according to time and place.&lt;ref name=OEIW-modern&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|authors=Maaike Voorhoeve|title=Divorce. Modern Practice|encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Islam and Women|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2013|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref:oiso/9780199764464.001.0001/acref-9780199764464-e-0108|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the rules of divorce were governed by [[sharia]], as interpreted by [[Fiqh|traditional Islamic jurisprudence]], and they differed depending on the [[Madhhab|legal school]].&lt;ref name=OEIW-hist&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|authors=Maaike Voorhoeve|title=Divorce. Historical Practice|encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Islam and Women|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2013|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref:oiso/9780199764464.001.0001/acref-9780199764464-e-0108|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historical practice sometimes diverged from legal theory.&lt;ref name=OEIW-hist/&gt; In modern times, as personal status (family) laws were codified, they generally remained "within the orbit of Islamic law", but control over the norms of divorce shifted from traditional jurists to the state.&lt;ref name=OEIW-modern/&gt;

==Judaism==
[[Judaism]] has always accepted divorce as a fact of life, though an unfortunate one: e.g., see [[Deuteronomy]] chapters 22 and 24.  Judaism generally maintains that it is better for a couple to divorce than to remain together in a state of bitterness and strife. It is said that ''[[shalom bayit]]'' (domestic harmony) is a desirable state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewfaq.org/divorce.htm Judaism 101/divorce]&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, it is accepted that for a Jewish divorce to be effective the husband must hand to the wife, and not vice versa, a bill of divorcement, called a [[get (divorce document)|get]], which also acts as proof of the divorce. From ancient times, the get was considered to be very important to show all those who needed to have proof that the woman was in fact free from the previous marriage and free to remarry. In Jewish law, besides other things, the consequences of a woman remarrying and having a child while still legally married to another is profound: the child would be a [[mamzer]], to be avoided at any cost. Also, the woman would be committing [[adultery]] should she remarry while still legally married to another. An enactment called '''Herem de-Rabbenu Gershom''' (literally, the proscription of [[Gershom ben Judah#Synod and bans|Rabbenu Gershom]])--accepted universally throughout European Jewish communities—prohibited a husband from divorcing his wife against her will.&lt;ref&gt;Malinowitz, Chaim; [http://www.jlaw.com/Articles/getart3.html "The New York State Get Bill and its Halachic Ramifications"], ''Jewish Law Articles''&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jewish law divorce is an act of the parties to the marriage, which is different from the approach adopted by many other legal systems. That is, a Jewish divorce does not require a decree from a court. The function of the court, in the absence of agreement between the parties, is to decide whether the husband should be compelled to give the ''get'' or for the wife to accept the ''get''. But, notwithstanding any such ruling, the parties remain married until such time as the husband actually delivers the ''get''.

Jewish law, in effect, does not require proof or even an allegation of moral or other fault by either party. In the first place, as noted above, if both parties agree to a divorce and follow the prescribed procedure, then the court would not need to establish responsibility for the marriage break-down. In the second place, if either party does not wish to continue co-habiting with the other is sufficient [[grounds for divorce]]. (Anything else, it is said, would amount to rape of the woman.) In this sense it is a "no-fault" approach to divorce. This approach has been accepted for thousands of years {{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}. It was the approach advocated by followers of [[Hillel the Elder|Hillel]], a very influential school of thought in ancient [[Judea]], which predated the current era. This is the approach which is now generally accepted in most, if not all, Jewish communities around the world.

On the other hand, the refusal of a husband to give his wife a [[get (divorce document)|get]] (the document) can be for purely vindictive or even extortion motives. This situation has resulted in numerous social problems in modern times. For example, where pre-nuptial agreements are enforceable in civil courts, appropriate provisions may be made to compel the giving of the get by the husband in the event of a civil divorce being obtained. A woman who has been refused a get is typically referred to as an "[[agunah]]".

A wife can initiate a divorce process on several grounds (including lack of satisfaction in her sexual life).  However, this right extends only so far as petitioning a court to force her husband to divorce her. Also see ''Jewish Attitude Toward Divorce''.&lt;ref&gt;

and [[Get (conflict)|Get in the Conflict of Laws]].

Furthermore, from the philosophical and mystical point of view, divorce is a unique procedure of tremendous importance and complexity, because it nullifies the holiest of connections that can exist in the Universe (similar to a connection between a person and God).  Because of the danger of the birth of illegitimate children ([[mamzer]]im) if the process is not performed properly, and because divorce law is extraordinarily complex, the process is generally supervised by experts.

In some Jewish mythologies, Adam had a wife before Eve named [[Lilith]] who left him. The earliest historically documentation of this legend appears in the  8th-10th centuries ''[[Alphabet of Ben Sira]]''. Whether this particular tradition is older is not known.

===Greek mythology===

After finding he intended to marry [[Glauce]]; for what Jason said was political ties; [[Medea]] murdered Glauce and her father with a burning dress; than proceeded to kill her own children Tisander and Alcimenes fearing they would be imprisoned. Afterwords she left to [[Athens]] on a chariot of dragons given to her by her grandfather Helios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/livesnecromance04godwgoog|title=Lives of the Necromancers|author=William Godwin|year=1876|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wicca===
The [[Wicca]]n equivalent of a divorce is described as a ''handparting''. Wiccans traditionally see either a high priest or high priestess to discuss things out before a divorce.&lt;ref&gt;A Handbook for Wiccan Clergy - Page 60, Kevin M. Gardner - 2007&lt;/ref&gt; However a handfasting (marriage) that falls apart peacefully does not necessarily need a handparting.&lt;ref&gt;All One Wicca: A Study in the Universal Eclectic Tradition of Wicca - Page 110, Kaatryn MacMorgan - 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unitarian Universalism===
In [[Unitarian Universalism]], divorce is allowed and should be a decision by the individual person and is seen as ending a rite of passage. Such divorces have sometimes taken the form of divorce rituals as far back as the 1960s. Divorces are largely seen as a life choice.&lt;ref&gt;Searching for Spiritual Unity...Can There Be Common Ground? Robyn E Lebron - 2012 Page 571&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient Greece==

{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}
Some scholars have suggested that Ancient Greek [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery religion]]s employed [[entheogens|entheogen]], such as the [[Kykeon]] central to the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]], to induce a trance or dream state. Research conducted by John R. Hale, Jelle Zeilinga de Boer, Jeffrey P. Chanton and Henry A. Spiller suggests that the prophecies of the [[Delphic Oracle]] were uttered by Priestesses under the influence of gaseous vapors exuded from the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/19/science/for-delphic-oracle-fumes-and-visions.html|title=For Delphic Oracle, Fumes and Visions|last=Broad|first=William J.|date=2002-03-19|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their findings are published in ''Questioning the Delphic Oracle: Overview / An Intoxicating Tale''.

== Buddhism ==
{{see also|Five Precepts|Buddhist ethics|ethic of reciprocity|karma|two truths doctrine}}
In Buddhism the Right [[view (Buddhism)|View]] (''{{IAST|samyag-dṛṣṭi}}'' / ''{{IAST|sammā-diṭṭhi}}'') can also be translated as "right perspective", "right outlook" or "right understanding", is the right way of looking at life, nature, and the world as they really are for us. It is to understand how our reality works. It acts as the reasoning with which someone starts practicing the path. It explains [[five aggregates|the reasons]] for our human existence, suffering, sickness, aging, death, the existence of greed, hatred, and delusion. Right view gives direction and efficacy to the other seven path factors. It begins with concepts and propositional knowledge, but through the practice of right concentration, it gradually becomes transmuted into wisdom, which can eradicate the [[fetter (Buddhism)|fetters of the mind]]. An understanding of right view will inspire the person to lead a virtuous life in line with right view. In the [[Pāli Canon|Pāli]] and [[Chinese Buddhist Canon|Chinese canons]], it is explained thus:&lt;ref name="BSac"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.141.than.html |title=Saccavibhanga Sutta |accessdate=6 May 2008|publisher=Access to Insight |last=Thanissaro Bhikkhu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TSac"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.141.piya.html |title=Saccavibhanga Sutta |accessdate=6 May 2008|publisher=Access to Insight |last=Piyadassi Thera}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thanissaro Bhikkhu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn45/sn45.008.than.html |title=Magga-vibhanga Sutta |accessdate=6 May 2008|publisher=Access to Insight |last=Thanissaro Bhikkhu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/T01/0026_007.htm |title=Madhyama Agama, Taisho Tripitaka Vol. 1, No. 26, sutra 31 (分別聖諦經第十一) |accessdate=27 October 2008 |publisher=Cbeta |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122103247/http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/T01/0026_007.htm |archivedate=22 November 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/T01/0032_001.htm|title=Taisho Tripitaka Vol. 1, No. 32, Page 814|accessdate=27 October 2008|publisher=Cbeta|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122092756/http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/T01/0032_001.htm|archivedate=22 November 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Right livelihood===
Right livelihood (''samyag-ājīva'' / ''sammā-ājīva''). This means that practitioners ought not to engage in trades or occupations which, either directly or indirectly, result in harm for other living beings.

=== The fifth precept ===
According to the fifth precept of the [[The Five Precepts|Pancasila]], [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] are meant to refrain from any quantity of "fermented or distilled beverages" which would prevent mindfulness or cause heedlessness.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |last1=Dahlke |first1=Paul |last2=Sīlācāra |first2=Bhikkhu |last3=Oates |first3=L.R. |last4=Lounsbery |first4=G. Constant |title=The Five Precepts |journal=The Wheel Publication |year=1963 |publisher=Buddhist Publication Society |location=Sri Lanka |volume= |issue=55 |pages= |url=http://www.bps.lk/olib/wh/wh055.pdf |issn=0068-3345 |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Pali]] [[Tipitaka]] the precept is explicitly concerned with [[alcoholic beverage]]s:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I undertake the training rule to abstain from fermented drink that causes heedlessness."
&lt;br /&gt;
''Surāmerayamajjapamādaṭṭhānā veramaṇī sikkhāpadaṃ samādiyāmi.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, [[caffeine]] and [[tea]] are permitted, even encouraged for monks of most traditions, as it is believed to promote wakefulness.

Generally speaking, the vast majority of Buddhists and Buddhist sects denounce and have historically frowned upon the use of any intoxicants by an individual who has taken the five precepts. Most Buddhists view the use and abuse of intoxicants to be a hindrance in the development of an [[Bodhicitta|enlightened mind]]. However, there are a few historical and doctrinal exceptions.

=== Vajrayana ===

{{see also|Skillful means|ganachakra|amrita}}

Many modern Buddhist schools have strongly discouraged the use of psychoactive drugs of any kind; however, they may not be prohibited in all circumstances in all traditions. Some denominations of [[Tantric Buddhism|tantric]] or esoteric Buddhism especially exemplify the latter, often with the principle [[skillful means]]:

==== Alcohol ====

For example, as part of the  [[ganachakra]] ''tsok'' ritual (as well as [[Homa (ritual)|Homa]], [[abhisheka]] and sometimes [[drubchen]]) some [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhists]] and [[Bön]]pos have been known to ingest small amounts of [[grain alcohol|grain]] [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] (called ''amrit'' or ''[[amrita#Buddhism|amrita]]'') as an offering. If a member is an alcoholic, or for some other reason does not wish to partake in the drinking of the alcoholic offering, then he or she may dip a finger in the alcohol and then flick it three times as [[Tsok#Alcohol in Vajrayana|part of the ceremony]].

Amrita is also possibly the same as, or at least in some sense a conceptual derivative of the ancient Hindu ''[[soma (drink)|soma]]''. (The latter which historians often equate with ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'' or other ''[[Amanita]]'' [[psychoactive drug|psychoactive]] [[fungi]].) Crowley (1996) states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Undoubtedly, the striking parallels between "The legend about Chakdor" and the Hindu legend of the origin of soma show that the Buddhist amrita and the Hindu soma were at one time understood to be identical. Moreover, the principal property of amrita is, to this day, perceived by Buddhists as being a species of inebriation, however symbolically this inebriation may be interpreted. Why else would beer (Tibetan ''chhang'', "barley beer") be used by yogins as a symbolic substitute for amrita [Ardussi]? Conversely, why else would the term bDud.rTsi be used as a poetic synonym for [[beer]]?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Conversely, in [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] and [[Sherpa people|Sherpa]] lore there is a story about a monk who came across a woman who told him that he must either:
* '''a.''' kill her goat,
* '''b.''' sleep with her, or
* '''c.''' drink a mug of [[beer]].
* '''d.''' All of the above.

The monk thought to himself, "''well, surely if I kill the goat then I will be causing great suffering since a living being will die. If I sleep with the woman then I will have broken another great vow of a monk and will surely be lost to the ways of the world. Lastly, if I drink the beer then perhaps no great harm will come and I will only be intoxicated for a while, and most importantly I will only be hurting myself.''" (In the context of the story this instance is of particular importance to him because monks in the Mahayana and Vajrayana [[bodhicitta|try to bring all sentient beings to enlightenment]] as part of their goal.)

So the monk drank the mug of beer and then he became very drunk. In his drunkenness he proceeded to kill the woman and sleep with the goat, breaking all three vows and, at least in his eyes, doing much harm in the world. The lesson of this story is meant to be that, at least according to the cultures from which it delineates, alcohol causes one to break all of one's vows, in a sense that one could say it is the cause of all other harmful deeds.&lt;ref&gt;one place this story is referenced is in the more Western article 'Sherpa Purity' by Sherry B. Ortner, published in the magazine American Anthropologist. The beginning of that article is available online, here: https://www.jstor.org/pss/672339 but the story is not available unless you login etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vajrayana]] teacher Drupon Thinley Ningpo [[Rinpoche]] has said that as part of the five precepts which a layperson takes upon [[Refuge (Buddhism)|taking refuge]], that although they must refrain from taking intoxicants, they may drink enough so as they do not become drunk. [[Bhikku]]s and [[Bhikkuni]]s (monks and nuns, respectively), on the other hand, who have taken the [[Five Precepts#Ten Precepts|ten vows]] as part of taking refuge and becoming ordained, cannot imbibe any amount of alcohol or other drugs, other than [[pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceutical]]s taken as medicine.

[[14th Dalai Lama|Tenzin Gyatso]], the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet, is known as teetotaler and non-smoker.

==== Hallucinogens ====
{{see also|Dzogchen|Rahu|tantrism}}

There is some evidence regarding the use of [[deliriant]] ''[[Datura]]'' seeds (known as ''candabija'') in Dharmic rituals associated with many [[tantras]] – namely the  ''Vajramahabhairava'', ''Samputa'', ''Mahakala'', ''Guhyasamaja'', ''Tara'' and ''Krsnayamari'' tantras – as well as [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and other [[entheogens]] in minority Vajrayana [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sanghas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vajrayana.faithweb.com/rich_text_5.html|title=Entheogens in the Vajrayana Tradition|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ronald M Davidson says that in Indian Vajrayana, [[Datura]] was:

&lt;blockquote&gt;“employed as a narcotic paste or as wood in a fire ceremony and could be easily absorbed through the skin or the lungs. The seeds of this powerful narcotic, termed "passion seeds"  (candabija), are the strongest elements and contain the alkaloids hyoscine, hyoscyamine, and atropine in forms that survive burning or boiling. In even moderate doses, datura can render a person virtually immobile with severe belladonna-like [[hallucinations]].”&lt;ref&gt;Ronald M Davidson 2002, Indian Esoteric Buddhism: a social history of the Tantric movement (datura and betel)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the ''Profound Summarizing Notes on the Path Presented as the Three Continua'' a [[Sakya]] [[Lamdre]] text, by [[Jamyang Khyentse Wangchuk]] (1524-1568), the use of [[Datura]] in combination with other substances, is prescribed as part of a meditation practice meant to establish that "All the phenomena included in apparent existence, samsara and nirvana, are not established outside of one's mind."&lt;ref&gt;Stearns, Cyrus; Taking the Result as the Path: Core Teachings of the Sakya Lamdre Tradition (Library of Tibetan Classics), 2006, page 421, 432.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ian Baker writes that Tibetan terma literature such as the [[Vima Nyingtik]] describes "various concoctions of mind altering substances, including datura and oleander, which can be formed into pills or placed directly in the eyes to induce visions and illuminate hidden contents of the psyche."&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Ian; The Heart of the World: A Journey to Tibet's Lost Paradise, Part Three, Hell night&lt;/ref&gt;

A book titled ''Zig Zag Zen: Buddhism and Psychedelics'' (2002), details the history of Buddhism and the use of psychedelic drugs, and includes essays by modern Buddhist teachers on the topic.

=== Zen ===

[[Zen Buddhism]] is known for stressing the precepts. [[Buddhism in Japan|In Japan]], however, where Zen flourished historically, there are a number of examples of misconduct on the part of monks and [[Laity|laypeople]] alike. This often involved the use of alcohol, as [[sake]] drinking has and continues to be a well known aspect of [[Japanese culture]].

The Japanese Zen monk and abbot, [[shakuhachi]] player and poet [[Ikkyu]] was known for his unconventional take on [[Zen Buddhism]]: His style of expressing [[dharma]] is sometimes deemed "Red Thread Zen" or "Crazy Cloud Zen" for its unorthodox characteristics. Ikkyu is considered both a heretic and saint in the [[Rinzai]] Zen tradition, and was known for his derogatory poetry, open [[alcoholism]] and for frequenting the services of [[prostitutes]] in [[brothels]]. He personally found no conflict between his lifestyle and Buddhism.

There are several [[koans]] (Zen riddles) referencing the drinking of sake ([[rice wine]]); for instance [[Mumonkan]]'s tenth koan titled ''Seizei Is Utterly Destitute'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'Seizei said to Sozan, "Seizei is utterly destitute. Will you give him support?" Sozan called out: "Seizei!" Seizei responded, "Yes sir?!" Sozan said, "You have finished three cups of the finest wine in China, and still you say you have not yet moistened your lips!"'
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another monk, Gudo, is mentioned in a koan called ''Finding a Diamond on a Muddy Road'' buying a gallon of sake.

==Judaism==
Judaism maintains that people do not own their bodies – they belong to God. As a result, Jews are not permitted to harm, mutilate, destroy or take risks with their bodies, life or health with activities such as taking life-threatening drugs. However, there is no general prohibition against drugs in Judaism, as long as they don't interfere with one's ritual duties and don't cause definite harm, though most Rabbis generally prohibit drugs, in order to avoid social, legal and medical problems in their community.

Spiritual use of various alcoholic beverages, sometimes in very large quantities, is common and well known. In some Jewish communities there is a tradition to get drunk on [[Purim]] until they forget the difference between the Hebrew phrases "Cursed is Haman" and "Blessed is Mordechai", which signified reaching the spiritual world [[Atzilut]] where all opposites unite. In many Jewish communities it is customary to drink on [[Simchat Torah]] as well. Drinking in small quantities as a mind-altering practice is commonly used during the [[Chabad|Farbrengens]] of the [[Chabad]] [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidim]]. A large body of Chabad literature refers to the spiritual dangers of drinking, but a few anecdotal references refer to the spirutal power of alcohol, when used for the sake of connecting to God and achieving brotherly love among fellows Jews.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} The Lubavitcher Rebbe forbade his Chassidim under the age of 40 to consume more than 4 small shots of hard liqueurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oztorah.com/2007/08/drugs-judaism/|title=Drugs &amp; Judaism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Wine]] plays a prominent role in many Jewish rituals, most notably the [[kiddush]].
Hasidic Jews often engage in a free ceremony called "Tisch" in which drinks such as Vodka are drunk in a group. Drinking is accompanied by singing and the study of the Torah.

Some Hasidic Rabbis, e.g. the [[Chaim Zanvl Abramowitz|Ribnitzer Rebbe]] used to drink large amounts of [[Vodka]] on some special occasions, apparently as a powerful mind-altering method. The [[Chaim Zanvl Abramowitz|Ribnitzer Rebbe]] also practiced severe [[sleep deprivation]], extremely long meditative prayers and a number of ascetic purification rituals. During his life in the [[USSR]] he used to immerse himself every day in ice water.

The spiritual use of [[caffeine]] and [[nicotine]] as stimulants is well known in the Hasidic communities. Many stories are told about miracles and spiritual journeys performed by the [[Baal Shem Tov]] and other famous [[Tzaddik]]im with the help of their smoking pipe. Some people suggest that, judging by the nature of these stories, the tobacco was sometimes mixed with strong mind-altering drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/practices/Ethics/Our_Bodies/Health_and_Healing/Smoking_Alcohol_and_Drugs/Tobacco.shtml|title=Tobacco|work=My Jewish Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cannabischassidis.blogspot.com/2005_02_01_archive.html|title=Cannabis Chassidis|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A popular Hasidic saying relates coffee to the Psalmic verse "Hope in God". The Hebrew word for "hope" ("Kave") sounds identical to the Yiddish word for coffee. Coffee is believed to have power to awaken the soul to the worship of God.

Some [[Kabbalists]], including [[Isaac ben Samuel of Acre|Isaac of Acco]] and [[Abraham Abulafia]], mention a method of "philosophical meditation", which involves drinking a cup of "strong wine of [[Avicenna]]", which would induce a [[trance]] and would help the adept to ponder over difficult philosophical questions.&lt;ref&gt;Aryeh Kaplan, Meditation and Kabbalah, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; The exact recipe of this wine remains unknown; Avicenna refers in his works to the effects of [[opium]] and [[datura]] extracts.

Rabbi [[Aryeh Kaplan]], a prominent researcher of Jewish meditations, suggested that some medieval Kabbalists may have used some psychedelic drugs&lt;ref&gt;Aryeh Kaplan, Meditation and Kabbalah, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, one can find in Kabbalistic medical manuals cryptic references to the hidden powers of [[Mandragora officinarum|mandrake]], [[harmal]] and other psychoactive plants, though the exact usage of these powers is hard to decipher.

According to [[Aryeh Kaplan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaplan|first=Aryeh|title=[[The Living Torah]]|location=New York|year=1981|page=442|isbn=0-940118-35-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; cannabis was an ingredient in the [[Holy anointing oil]] mentioned in various sacred [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] texts.  The herb of interest is most commonly known as ''kaneh-bosem'' (קְנֵה-בֹשֶׂם&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cannabisculture.com/backissues/cc11/christ.html |title=Cannabis and the Christ: Jesus used Marijuana |work=[[Cannabis Culture (magazine)|Cannabis Culture]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822175502/http://www.cannabisculture.com/backissues/cc11/christ.html |archivedate=2009-08-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) which is mentioned several times in the [[Old Testament]] as a bartering material, incense, and an ingredient in Holy anointing oil used by the high priest of the temple. Many [[Rastafarians]], who use cannabis as a sacrament, identify as Jewish.

According to [[Josephus]], the head-dress of the Jewish High Priests' was modeled upon the capsule of the [[Hyoscyamus niger|Hyoscyamus]] flower, which he calls "Saccharus". This Greek word for sugar stems from the Hebrew root that means "intoxicating".&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, Antiquities, Book III, 7:6&lt;/ref&gt;

Benny Shanon, a psychology professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, proposed that Moses may have been high on hallucinogenic mushrooms at the time he received the Ten Commandments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-525993/Moses-high-hallucinogenic-drug-received-Ten-Commandments-claims-academic.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title='Moses was high on hallucinogenic drug when he received Ten Commandments,' claims top academic | date=2008-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity==
{{see also|Christian views on alcohol|}}

Many [[Christian]] denominations disapprove of the use of most illicit drugs. Many denominations permit the moderate use of socially and legally acceptable drugs like [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[caffeine]] and [[tobacco]]. Some [[Christian]] denominations permit smoking [[tobacco]], while others disapprove of it. Many denominations do not have any official stance on drug use, some more-recent Christian denominations (e.g. [[Mormons]], [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]] and [[Jehovah’s Witnesses]]) discourage or prohibit the use of any of these substances.

Because [[Jesus]] and many Biblical figures drank [[wine]], most [[Christian]] denominations do not require [[teetotalism]]. In the Eucharist, wine represents (or among [[Christian]]s who believe in some form of [[Real Presence]], like the Catholic, Lutheran and Orthodox churches, actually ''is'') the blood of Christ. Lutherans believe in the real presence of the body and blood of Christ in the Eucharist,&lt;ref name=WELSparticipation&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&amp;cuTopic_topicID=814&amp;cuItem_itemID=1045 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080102081951/https://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&amp;cuTopic_topicID=814&amp;cuItem_itemID=1045 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2 January 2008 |work=WELS Topical Q&amp;A |title=1 Corinthians 10:16 - Meaning of "Participation |publisher=[[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] |accessdate=4 Feb 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WELSQA&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&amp;cuTopic_topicID=258&amp;cuItem_itemID=8633 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080102005853/https://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&amp;cuTopic_topicID=258&amp;cuItem_itemID=8633 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2 January 2008 |work=WELS Topical Q&amp;A |title=Beliefs of other Church |publisher=[[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] |quote=As [[Confessional Lutheran]]s we believe in baptismal regeneration, the real presence of Christ's body and blood in the Lord's Supper, and infant baptism. |accessdate=4 Feb 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; that the body and blood of Christ are "truly and substantially present in, with and under the forms."&lt;ref name=WLS-Real&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wlsessays.net/files/BrugReal.pdf |title=The Real Presence of Christ’s Body and Blood in The Lord's Supper: Contemporary Issues Concerning the Sacramental Union |last=Brug |first=John F. |publisher=[[Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary]] |quote=Lutherans have always emphasized that Christ's true body and blood are really present "in, with, and under" the bread and wine and that Christ's true body and blood are received by all who receive the elements, either to their blessing or to their condemnation...Lutherans emphasize that although the presence of Christ in the Sacrament is a supernatural presence, which is beyond our understanding and explanations, it is a real, substantial presence.

On the other hand, some [[Protestant]] Christian denominations, such as [[Baptist]]s and [[Methodist]]s associated with the [[temperance movement]], encourage or require teetotalism. In some Protestant denomination, grape juice or non-alcoholic wine is used in place of wine to represent the blood of Christ.
 
The best known Western prohibition against alcohol happened in the United States in the 1920s, where concerned prohibitionists were worried about its dangerous side effects. However, the demand for alcohol remained and criminals stepped in and created the supply. The consequences of organized crime and the popular demand for alcohol, led to alcohol being legalized again.

==Islam==

Islam prohibits all drugs that are not medically prescribed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Islam: Drugs|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/rs/sanctity/isdrugsrev2.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islam's prohibition of drugs&lt;ref name=IslamO1&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Yusuf Al-Qaradawi]]|title=Islam Prohibits Alcohol and Drugs|url=http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&amp;cid=1119503545310}}&lt;/ref&gt; stems from two concerns:
*their intoxication effects
*their harm to the human body

There are numerous verses in the Qur'an and hadith that ban ''[[khamr]]'' (intoxicants, including [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]]). [[Muhammad]] said:&lt;ref name=IslamO1/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Every intoxicant is like alcohol, and every (type of) alcohol is prohibited. ([[Sahih Muslim|Muslim]])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The second reason for banning drugs is that they are believed to have a harmful effect on the body. The Qur'an says,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"And make not your own hands contribute to your destruction." Surah, Al-Baqara, 2: 195&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Muslim nations of Turkey and Egypt were instrumental in banning [[opium]], [[cocaine]], and [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] when the [[League of Nations]] committed to the 1925 International Convention relating to opium and other drugs (later the 1934 Dangerous Drugs Act). The primary goal was to ban opium and cocaine, but cannabis was added to the list, and it remained there largely unnoticed due to the much more heated debate over opium and coca. The 1925 Act has been the foundation upon which every subsequent policy in the [[United Nations]] has been founded. Cannabis use and abuse as an intoxicant was largely unknown in the West at that point, but Islamic leaders have been critical of it since the 13th century.

O You who believe! Intoxicants and gambling, (dedication of) stones and (divination by) arrows are an abomination of Satan’s handiwork. Avoid (such abominations) that you may prosper. (5:90)

Satan’s plan is to sow hatred and enmity amongst you with intoxicants and gambling, and to hamper you from the remembrance of Allah and from prayer. Will you not give up? (5:91)

There are no prohibitions in Islam on alcohol for scientific, industrial or automotive use.

In spite of these restrictions on substance use, tobacco and caffeine are still widely used throughout many Muslim nations.

==Bahá'í Faith==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}
[[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]] are forbidden to drink [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] or to take drugs, unless prescribed by doctors.  Accordingly, the sale and trafficking of such substances is also forbidden.  Smoking is discouraged but not prohibited.

==Rastafari movement==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}
Many [[Rastafari movement|Rastafari]] believe [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], which they call "ganja," "the herb," or "Kaya," is a sacred gift of [[Jah]]. It may be used for spiritual purposes to commune with God, but should not be used profanely. The use of other drugs, however, including alcohol, is frowned upon. Many believe that the wine Jesus/Iyesus drank was not an alcoholic beverage, but simply the juice of grapes or other fruits.

While some Rastafari suggest that the Bible may refer to marijuana, it is generally held by academics specializing in the archaeology and paleobotany of [[Ancient Israel]], and those specializing in the lexicography of the [[Hebrew Bible]], that cannabis is not documented or mentioned in early Judaism. Against this some popular writers&lt;ref&gt;Dan Merkur ''The Mystery of Manna: The Psychedelic Sacrament of the Bible'' (2001); James D. Dure, ''Manna Magic Mushroom of Moses : Manna Botanical I.D. of a Biblical Sacrament'' (self published, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that there is evidence for religious use of cannabis in the Hebrew Bible, although this hypothesis and some of the specific case studies (e.g., [[John Allegro]] in relation to [[Qumran]], 1970) have been "widely dismissed as erroneous" (Merlin, 2003).&lt;ref&gt;[[Economic Botany]] [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1663/0013-0001(2003)057%5B0295:AEFTTO%5D2.0.CO%3B2#page-1  M. D. Merlin  Archaeological Evidence for the Tradition of Psychoactive Plant Use in the Old World - University of Hawaii] "23 May 2011 - ".. Judaism (Dure 2001; Merkur 2000), and Christianity (Allegro 1970; Ruck et al. 2001). Although this hypothesis and some of the specific case studies (e.g., Allegro 1970) have been widely dismissed as erroneous, others continue"&lt;/ref&gt; The primary advocate of a religious use of cannabis plant in early Judaism was [[Sula Benet]] (1967), who claimed that the plant ''kaneh bosm קְנֵה-בֹשֶׂם'' mentioned five times in the Hebrew Bible, and used in the [[holy anointing oil]] of the Book of Exodus, was in fact cannabis,&lt;ref&gt;Rowan Robinson, The Great Book of Hemp, Health &amp; Fitness, 1995, pag. 89&lt;/ref&gt; although lexicons of Hebrew and dictionaries of plants of the Bible such as by [[Michael Zohary]] (1985), [[Hans Arne Jensen]] (2004) and [[James A. Duke]] (2010) and others identify the plant in question as either ''[[Acorus calamus]]'' or ''[[Cymbopogon citratus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Lytton J. Musselman ''Figs, dates, laurel, and myrrh: plants of the Bible and the Quran'' 2007 p73&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reasoning ===
A "reasoning" is a simple event where the Rastas gather, smoke cannabis ("ganja"), and discuss. The person honored by being allowed to light the herb says a short sentence beforehand. The ganja is passed in a clockwise fashion (passing 'pon the lef' han' side) except in times of war, when it is passed counterclockwise. It is used to reason with Jah.

=== Groundation ===
A "groundation" (also spelled "grounation") or "binghi" is a holy day; the name "binghi" is derived from "Nyabinghi" (literally "Nya" meaning "black" and "Binghi" meaning "victory"). Binghis are marked by much dancing, singing, feasting, and the smoking of "ganja", and can last for several days.

=== Bible verses which Rastas believe justify cannabis use ===
...thou shalt eat the herb of the field.

Genesis 3.18

...eat every herb of the land.

Exodus 10:12

Better is a dinner of herb where love is, than a stalled ox and hatred therewith.

Proverbs 15:17

=== Beliefs about other drugs ===
According to many Rastas, the illegality of cannabis in many nations is evidence of persecution of Rastafari. They are not surprised that it is illegal, viewing Cannabis as a powerful substance that opens people's minds to the truth – something the Babylon system, they reason, clearly does not want. Cannabis use is contrasted with the use of alcohol and other drugs, which they feel destroy the mind.

==Asatru==
Alcoholic drinks are commonly used during Asatru blots but non-alcoholic drinks can be substituted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ravenkindred.com/RBRituals.html|title=The Rituals of Asatru|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.tripod.com/heathen_home/faq.html#11]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Culture of Korea}}

'''Religion in Korea''' refers the various religious traditions practiced on the [[Korean Peninsula|Korean peninsula]]. The oldest indigenous religion of [[Korea]] is [[Korean shamanism]], which has been passed down from prehistory to the present.{{sfnp|Yu|2012|p=41}} [[Buddhism]] was introduced to Korea from China during the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Three Kingdoms]] era in the 4th century, and the religion flourished until the [[Joseon]] Dynasty, when [[Korean Confucianism]] became the state religion.{{sfnp|Encyclopaedia Britannica|2008|p=162}} During the Late Joseon Dynasty, in the 19th century, [[Christianity]] began to gain a foothold in Korea.{{sfnp|Kim|2012}} While both Christianity and Buddhism would play important roles in the resistance to the [[Japanese occupation of Korea]] in the first half of the 20th century,{{sfnp|Yu|2012|p=xv}} only about 4% of Koreans were members of a religious organization in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Making Sense of the Secular: Critical Perspectives from Europe to Asia|last=Baker|first=Don|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=978-1136277214|editor-last=Ghosh|editor-first=Ranjan|location=|pages=182–193|chapter=Korea's Path of Secularisation|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0v7ipRmW6M0C&amp;pg=PA184&amp;dq=page182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[division of Korea]] into two sovereign states in 1945—[[North Korea]] and [[South Korea]]—religious life in the two countries has diverged, shaped by different political structures.

{{Inca civilization}}
In the heterogeneous [[Inca Empire]], [[polytheistic]] religions were practiced. Some deities, such as [[Pachamama]] and [[Viracocha]], were known throughout the empire, while others were localised.

==Deities==
[[Image:Sol de Mayo-Bandera de Argentina.svg|'''Inti''' or [[Sun of May]] of the [[flag of Argentina]], 1818|right|thumb|x216px]]
Inca deities occupied the three realms:
*''[[Hanan Pacha|hanan pacha]]'', the celestial realm in the sky.
*''[[Ukhu Pacha|ukhu pacha]]'', the inner earth realm.
*''[[Kay Pacha|kay pacha]]'', the outer earth realm, where humans live.

=== Deities of the Official Pantheon ===
*[[File:Viracocha (porta do sol - detalhe).jpg|thumb|Viracocha depicted in the wall as a man]]'''[[Viracocha]]''':&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/156911932|title=The history of the Incas|last=1532-1592.|first=Sarmiento de Gamboa, Pedro,|date=2007|publisher=University of Texas Press|others=Bauer, Brian S., Smith-Oka, Vania, 1975-|isbn=9780292714137|edition=1st|location=Austin|oclc=156911932}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was typically seen as a white male human and known as the creator of humanity and everything else in the world.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/708564500|title=Gods, goddesses, and mythology|date=2005|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|others=Littleton, C. Scott.|isbn=0761475656|location=New York|oclc=708564500}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Inca Water Worship and Religion, it states, "He created humanity on an island in Lake Titicaca on the border between modern Peru and Bolivia and taught people how to live, assigning them tribal dress and customs and determining where they should live."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Inca Water Worship and Religion|last=Gibaja Oviedo|first=Arminda M., et al.|publisher=American Society of Civil Engineers|year=2016|isbn=9780784414163|location=Reston, VA|pages=11–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this occurred, Viracocha gave control over humanity to lower gods then disappeared. When the Spaniards came to the Inca territory, the Inca thought they were god like because of their similarities in appearance with Viracocha.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''[[Inti]]:'''  Inti was one of the most important gods to the Inca people and known as the sun god. He is typically viewed as a boy from the Inca society and was also known as a golden disk with fire like rays coming and a face in the middle.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/62805010|title=Incan mythology and other myths of the Andes|last=Greg.|first=Roza,|date=2008|publisher=Rosen Central|isbn=1404207392|edition=1st|location=New York|oclc=62805010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Inca believed the sun was a key element for agriculture by protecting and helping with the growth of their crops.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The temple dedicated to Inti was the [[Coricancha]]&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; (a.k.a. The Golden Enclosure), which was one of the most important temples for the Inca people.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Inside Coricancha was a miniature field of corn and the corn was made out of gold. Annually, the emperor would "farm" this as a tradition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Viracocha did not start out as the top deity in Inca religion, Inti was the first original and most powerful god. The transition from Inti to Virachocha has a couple of theories including: 1. The [[Inca society]] and people developed intellectually and started to question Inti's power. They questioned why an all powerful god did the same thing everyday.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 2. The society moved forward and they started going more towards monotheism (one god ruled over everything else, not that there was only one god). Since Viracocha was seen as a human, they saw this as being more powerful.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Illapa (Inti-Illapa):''' The name of this god means thunder and controls things like weather, rain, and lightning.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/46449340|title=The Incas|last=N.,|first=D'Altroy, Terence|date=2002|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=1405116765|location=Malden, Mass.|oclc=46449340}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Inca valued this god because Illapa was in control of the weather and the growth of their crops.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many of the Inca society saw the image of this deity as a man wearing a sling.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Every time that Illapa would use the sling it would create the thunder heard by the Inca people.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
* '''[[Mama Killa|Mamaquilla]] (Kilyamama'''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;'''):''' The name of this god in the Inca language can be translated into Mother Moon.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; All of the Inca society recognized this deity as female and was also seen as a silver disk with a face in the middle.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She was the wife of the deity Inti and was also in control of calendars.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This god was in charge of calendars because of the moons cycle which the Inca could track.  All the temples that worshiped Mamaquilla were worked on by priestesses.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* '''[[Pachamama]]:''' The name of this god translates to Earth Mother and is known as a female among the Inca society.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The Inca saw her as a protector of their crops/fields and a god of fertility to help their crops grow.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* '''Mamacocha:''' The meaning of this gods name from the Inca language is Mother of Lakes and is widely known as a female.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The job of this deity is to keep the world strong and provide sources of water.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* '''Stella Deities:''' These are deities formed using constellations or other cosmology features and are mostly believed to be of animals or activities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the book ''Inca Water Worship and Religion'', an example would be "Urcuchillay, which is known to western astronomers as Lira, [who] was thought to protect llamas and alpacas."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* '''Huacas'''&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;''':'''  Anything, including people, places, and objects, in the world that the Inca believed had a supernatural spirit, were called Huacas.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The size of the Huaca determined how much power it had. For example, mountains were considered some of the more powerful Huacas. The Inca worshiped and cared for them similar to the other deities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Household gods=== 
[[File:Camelid Conopa, 1470-1532, 36.683.jpg|thumb|Caullama conopa, 1470-1532]]
In addition to the communally worshiped deities, Incan families sometimes worshiped household gods via their representation as miniature figurines most commonly referred to as ''chancas'' or ''conopas''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kenneth Mills |authorlink= |title=Idolatry and Its Enemies: Colonial Andean Religion and Extirpation, 1640-1750 |year=2012 |publisher=Princeton University Press |chapter=Chancas and Conopas |pages=75–100 |quote= | chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rOo9DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA75 |isbn=9780691155487 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conopa were often natural or carved stone objects that resembled crops or livestock, such as ''zarap conopa'' for [[maize]], ''papap conopa'' for potatoes and caullama for [[llamas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Andrew James Hamilton |authorlink= |title=Scale and the Incas |year=2018 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location= |pages=60–63 |quote= | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sC1KDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA60 |isbn=9781400890194 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Pablo Joseph de Arriaga |translator=L. Clark Keating | authorlink=Pablo José Arriaga |title=Extirpacion de l'Idolatría en el Perú |trans-title=The Extirpation of Idolatry in Peru |year=2015 |orig-year=1621 |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |pages=28–30 |quote= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kt4eBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA28 |isbn=9780813163338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2014}}
Many ancient Andean peoples traced their origins to ancestral deities. Multiple clans could share similar ancestral origins. The Inca claimed descent from the Sun and the Moon, their Father and Mother. Many clans claimed descent from early proto-humans that emerged from local sites in nature called pacarinas.

The earliest ancestors of the Inca were known as Ayar, the first of which was [[Manco Cápac|Manco Capac]] or Ayar Manco. Inca mythology tells of his travels, in which he and the Ayar shaped and marked the land and introduced the cultivation of [[maize]].

==Religious expansion==
Religious traditions in the Andes tended to vary among different ayllus. While the Inca generally allowed or even incorporated local deities and heroes of the ayllus they conquered, they did bring their gods to those peoples by incorporating them in law such as required sacrifice. The Inca attempted to combine their deities with conquered ones in ways that raised the status of their own. One example of this is Pachamama, the goddess of Earth, who was worshiped long before the rise of the Inca. In the Inca mythology Pachamama having been integrated was placed below the Moon who the Inca believed ruled over all female gods.&lt;ref name=Steele2004&gt;{{cite book |last=Steele |first=Paul Richar d|title=Handbook of World Mythology |year=2004 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1576073544}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Duality==
A theme in Inca mythology is the duality of the Cosmos. The realms were separated into the upper and lower realms, the ''hanan pacha'' and the ''ukhu pacha'' and ''urin pacha''. ''Hanan pacha'', the upper world, consisted of the deities of the sun, moon, stars, rainbow, and lightning while ''ukhu pacha'' and ''urin pacha'' were the realms of Pachamama, the earth mother, and the ancestors and heroes of the Inca or other ayllus. ''Kay pacha'', the realm of the outer earth, where humans resided was viewed as an intermediary realm between ''hanan pacha'' and ''ukhu pacha''. The realms were represented by the [[condor]] (upper world), [[Cougar|puma]] (outer earth) and [[snake]] (inner earth).

Sacred sites or things named ''[[Huaca|wak'a]]'' were spread around the Inca Empire. In Andean mythology a ''wak'a'' was a deific entity which resided in natural objects such as mountains, boulders, streams, battle fields, other meeting places, and any type of place that was connected with past Incan rulers. A ''wak'a'' could also be an inanimate object such as pottery which was believed to be a deity-carrying vessel. Spiritual leaders in a community would use [[prayer]] and offerings to communicate with a ''wak'a'' for advice or assistance. Human sacrifice was part of Incan rituals in which they usually [[Child sacrifice in pre-Columbian cultures|sacrificed a child]] (''[[qhapaq hucha]]'') or a slave. The Incan people thought it was an honor to die as an offering.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Archaeological remains confirm such human sacrificial practices, according to Reinhard and Ceruti: "Archaeological evidence found on distant mountain summits has established that the burial of offerings was a common practice among the Incas and that human sacrifice took place at several of the sites. The excellent preservation of the bodies and other material in the cold and dry environment of the high Andes provides revealing details about the rituals that were performed at these ceremonial complexes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reinhard |first1=Johan |first2=Constanza |last2=Ceruti |title=Sacred Mountains, Ceremonial Sites, and Human Sacrifice Among the Incas |journal=Archaeoastronomy: The Journal of Astronomy in Culture |year=2005 |volume=19 |pages=2 |issn=0190-9940}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divination==
The Incas also used [[divination]]. Divination was used to inform people in the city of social events, predict battle outcomes, and ask for metaphysical intervention.

Divination was essential before taking any action.  Nearly every religious rite was accompanied by sacrifices.  These were usually maize beer, food or llamas, but were occasionally of virgins or children. &lt;ref&gt;Eerdman's Handbook to the World's Religions, 1982, Lion Publishing, Herts, England, page 55&lt;/ref&gt; 

Divination was an important part of Inca religion, as reflected in the following quote:
{{quote|The native elements are more obvious in the case of the sunrise divination. Apachetas, [[coca]] and the sun were major elements in pre-Conquest religion, and divination, the worship of sacred mountains and the bringing retribution against enemies were important ritual practices.&lt;ref name=Rowe1946&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of South American Indians Vol. 2 The Andean Civilizations |year=1946 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |location=Washington |pages=183–330 |last=Rowe |first=John H. |editor=Julian H. Steward |url=http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/ANTH/emeritus/rowe/pub/rowe.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|292–314}}}}

== Mummification ==
The rulers of the Inca empire, such as the last united Inca ruler [[Huayna Capac]], were often mummified upon the time of their death, allowing for their bodies to be worshipped within the palaces.These worshipping events were intercepted by the Spaniards under Juan Polo de Ondegardo y Zárate, who was newly appointed as the Chief Magistrate of [[Cuzco]] in 1559, when it was under Spanish control. Ondegardo conducted a massive effort to prevent the [[Inca]] from committing their  “idolatrous sins”, mainly by locating the mummified bodies of late Inca kings and sending them to the viceroy in [[Lima]].&lt;ref name="Hospital"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bauer|first1=Brian S.|last2=Rodriguez|first2=Antonio C.|date=2007|title=The Hospital of San Andrés (Lima, Peru) and the Search for the Royal Mummies of the Incas|journal=Fieldiana Anthropology|volume=39|pages=1–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; They remained in a hospital for around 80 years before their whereabouts became unknown.The Inca used to mummify their kings and several times a year they would be aligned in accordance to when they chronologically ruled in Cuzco’s plaza for the public to pay their respects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Peruvian Traditions|last1=Palma|first1=Ricardo|date=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the other parts of the year, the mummies were returned to the Cuzco palaces and were worshipped privately by groups of visitors. [[Francisco Pizarro]] stated that “It was customary for the dead to visit one another, and they held great dances and debaucheries, and sometimes the dead went to the house of the living, and sometimes the living came to the house of the dead”.&lt;ref name="Hospital" /&gt; The kings were thought to have been able to speak back to the worshippers through the use of oracles, and even gave advice to the protection and ruling of the land. The ruling Inca was expected to seek advice from the mummies of his ancestors for important issues. Not all Inca mummies were glorified, however, as in one case Topa Inca Yupanqui’s mummified body was torched and his bloodline all killed as they sided with [[Huascar]] in the civil war.&lt;ref name="Hospital" /&gt;

Upon the arrival of the Spanish, the [[Inca]] started to hide the bodies of the kings and become more secretive with their worship, as stated by [[Juan de Betanzos]]. After being appointed, Polo do Ondegardo and his men found most of the mummified kings and took their bodies along with other ritualistic items such as their huaques, or their statues. A popular thought is that Ondegardo had the bodies buried in or around [[Cuzco]] in secret so that they would not be uncovered and worshipped again. Garcilaso de la Vega visited Ondegardo’s house and was shown an assembly of embalmed kings and attested to the degree of their preservation: “The bodies were perfectly preserved without the loss of hair of the head or brow or an eyelash. They were dressed as if they had been in life, with Ilautus (royal headbands) on their heads… their hands were crossed across their breast.”. The mummies were afterwards sent to the viceroy for him to see them and then afterwards they were brought back to Cuzco and thought to be secretly buried.The viceroy stored the mummies in the Hospital of San Andres in [[Lima]] because he was “a major benefactor of it”. Since the hospital was solely for the Spanish residents, they were likely on display for the citizens to view, away from the natives.&lt;ref name="Hospital" /&gt;

The Inca calendar had 12 months of 30 days, with each month having its own festival, and a five-day feast at the end, before the new year began. The Incan year started in December, and began with Qhapaq Raymi, the magnificent festival.&lt;ref name=Kendall1989&gt;{{cite book |last=Kendall |first=Ann |title=Everyday life of the Incas |year=1989 |publisher=Dorset Press |location=New York |isbn=9780880293501}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14069">'''Religiosity''' is difficult to define, but different scholars have seen this concept as broadly about religious orientations and involvement. It includes experiential, ritualistic, ideological, intellectual, consequential, creedal, communal, doctrinal, moral, and cultural dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Holdcroft|first1=Barbara|title=What is Religiosity?|journal=Catholic Education: A Journal of Inquiry and Practice|date=September 2006|volume=10|issue=1|pages=89–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologists of religion have observed that the people's beliefs, sense of belonging, and behavior often are not congruent with an individual's actual religious beliefs since there is much diversity in how one can be religious or not.&lt;ref name="chaves" /&gt; Multiple problems exist in measuring religiosity. For instance, variables such as church attendance produce different results when different methods are used such as traditional surveys vs time use surveys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rossi |first1=Maurizio |last2=Scappini |first2=Ettore |title=Church Attendance, Problems of Measurement, and Interpreting Indicators: A Study of Religious Practice in the United States, 1975-2010 |journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion |date=June 2014 |volume=53 |issue=2 |page=249–267 |doi=10.1111/jssr.12115 |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jssr.12115 |publisher=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion |issn=0021-8294}}&lt;/ref&gt;    

==Diversity in an individuals' beliefs, affiliations, and behaviors==

Decades of anthropological, sociological, and psychological research have established that "religious congruence" (the assumption that religious beliefs and values are tightly integrated in an individual's mind or that religious practices and behaviors follow directly from religious beliefs or that religious beliefs are chronologically linear and stable across different contexts) is actually rare. People’s religious ideas are fragmented, loosely connected, and context-dependent; like in all other domains of culture and in life. The beliefs, affiliations, and behaviors of any individual are complex activities that have many sources including culture. As examples of religious incongruence he notes, "Observant Jews may not believe what they say in their Sabbath prayers. Christian ministers may not believe in God. And people who regularly dance for rain don’t do it in the dry season."&lt;ref name="chaves"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chaves|first1=Mark|title=SSSR Presidential Address Rain Dances in the Dry Season: Overcoming the Religious Congruence Fallacy|journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|date=March 2010|volume=49|issue=1|pages=1–14|doi=10.1111/j.1468-5906.2009.01489.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Demographic studies often show wide diversity of religious beliefs, belonging, and practices in both religious and non-religious populations. For instance, out of Americans who are not religious and not seeking religion: 68% believe in God, 12% are atheists, 17% are agnostics; also, in terms of self-identification of religiosity 18% consider themselves religious, 37% consider themselves as spiritual but not religious, and 42% considers themselves as neither spiritual nor religious; and 21% pray every day and 24% pray once a month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commons.trincoll.edu/aris/files/2011/08/NONES_08.pdf|title=American Nones: The Profile of the No Religion Population|year=2008|publisher=American Religious Identification Survey|accessdate=2014-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pew 2012 breakdown"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/10/09/nones-on-the-rise-religion/ |title=Religion and the Unaffiliated |work="Nones" on the Rise |date=October 9, 2012 |publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]: Religion &amp; Public Life |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Most Nones Believe God"&gt;{{cite web|title=Most of the Religiously Unaffiliated Still Keep Belief in God|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/daily-number/most-of-the-religiously-unaffiliated-still-keep-belief-in-god/|website=Pew Research Center|date=November 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Global studies on religion also show diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Global Religious Landscape|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/12/18/global-religious-landscape-exec/|website=Pew Research Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components==
Numerous studies have explored the different components of human religiosity (Brink, 1993; Hill &amp; Hood 1999). What most have found is that there are multiple dimensions (they often employ [[factor analysis]]). For instance, Cornwall, Albrecht, Cunningham and Pitcher (1986) identify six dimensions of religiosity based on the understanding that there are at least three components to religious behavior: knowing (cognition in the mind), feeling (effect to the spirit), and doing (behavior of the body). For each of these components of religiosity, there were two cross classifications resulting in the six dimensions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cornwall |author2=Albrecht |author3=Cunningham |author4=Pitcher |title=The Dimensions of Religiosity: A Conceptual Model with an Empirical Test|journal=Review of Religious Research|year=1986|volume=27|issue=3|pages=226–244|doi=10.2307/3511418}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Cognition
**traditional [[orthodoxy]]
**particularistic orthodoxy
*Effect
**Palpable
**Tangible
*Behavior
**religious behavior
**religious participation

Other researchers have found different dimensions, ranging generally from four to twelve components. What most measures of religiosity find is that there is at least some distinction between religious doctrine, religious practice, and [[spirituality]].

For example{{original research inline|date=February 2011}}, one can accept the truthfulness of the [[Bible]] (belief dimension), but never attend a church or even belong to an organized religion (practice dimension).  Another example is an individual who does not hold orthodox [[Christian]] doctrines (belief dimension), but does attend a [[Charismatic Movement|charismatic]] [[worship]] service (practice dimension) in order to develop his/her sense of oneness with the [[divinity|divine]] (spirituality dimension).

An individual could disavow all doctrines associated with organized religions (belief dimension), not affiliate with an organized religion or attend religious services (practice dimension), and at the same time be strongly committed to a higher power and feel that the connection with that higher power is ultimately relevant (spirituality dimension). These are explanatory examples of the broadest dimensions of religiosity and may not be reflected in specific religiosity measures.

Most dimensions of religiosity are correlated, meaning people who often attend church services (practice dimension) are also likely to score highly on the belief and spirituality dimensions. But individuals do not have to score high on all dimensions or low on all dimensions; their scores can vary by dimension.

[[Sociologists]] have differed over the exact number of components of religiosity. [[Charles Y. Glock|Charles Glock]]'s five-dimensional approach (Glock, 1972: 39) was among the first of its kind in the field of [[sociology of religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Glock, C. Y. (1972) ‘On the Study of Religious Commitment’ in J. E. Faulkner (ed.) Religion’s Influence in Contemporary Society, Readings 
in the Sociology of Religion, Ohio: Charles E. Merril: 38-56.&lt;/ref&gt; Other sociologists adapted Glock's list to include additional components (see for example, a  [[Mervin F. Verbit#The Twenty Four-Dimensional Religiosity Measure|six component measure]] by [[Mervin F. Verbit]]).&lt;ref&gt;Verbit, M. F. (1970). The components and dimensions of religious behavior: Toward a reconceptualization of religiosity. American mosaic, 24, 39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Küçükcan, T. (2010). Multidimensional Approach to Religion: a way of looking at religious phenomena. Journal for the Study of Religions and Ideologies, 4(10), 60-70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eskieserler.com/dosyalar/mpdf%20(1135).pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contributions ==

===Genes and environment===

[[File:Church Attendance and Welfare Spending Graph.png|thumb|350px|National welfare spending vs church attendance in Christian societies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = State Welfare Spending and Religiosity | journal = Comparative Political Studies | first = Anthony | last = Gill |author2=Erik Lundsgaarde  | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 399–436 | year = 2004| doi = 10.1177/1043463104046694 }}  [http://faculty.washington.edu/tgill/Gill%20Lundsgaarde%20Welfare%20Religion.pdf Free PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The contributions of [[genes]] and [[Natural environment|environment]] to religiosity have been quantified in [[twin study|studies of twins]] (Bouchard ''et al.'', 1999; Kirk ''et al.'', 1999) and sociological studies of welfare, availability, and legal regulations &lt;ref&gt;Nolan, P., &amp; Lenski, G. E. (2010). Human societies: Introduction to macrosociology. Boulder, CO: Paradigm Publisher.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[state religions]], etc.).

Koenig ''et al.'' (2005) report that the contribution of genes to variation in religiosity (called [[heritability]]) increases from 12% to 44% and the contribution of shared (family) effects decreases from 56% to 18% between [[adolescence]] and [[adulthood]].&lt;ref&gt;L. B. Koenig, M. McGue, R. F. Krueger and T. J. Bouchard, Jr. (2005). Genetic and environmental influences on religiousness: findings for retrospective and current religiousness ratings. ''Journal of Personality'', '''73''', [https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-6494.2005.00316.x 471-88]&lt;/ref&gt;

A market-based theory of religious choice and governmental regulation of religion have been the dominant theories used to explain variations of religiosity between societies{{Clarify|date=January 2017}}.  However, Gill and Lundsgaarde (2004) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = State Welfare Spending and Religiosity | journal = Comparative Political Studies | first = Anthony | last = Gill |author2=Erik Lundsgaarde  | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 399–436 | year = 2004| doi = 10.1177/1043463104046694 }}  [http://faculty.washington.edu/tgill/Gill%20Lundsgaarde%20Welfare%20Religion.pdf Free PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; documented a much stronger correlation between welfare state spending and religiosity.  See "Welfare spending vs Church attendance" diagram on the right.

===Just-world hypothesis===
Studies have found [[Just-world hypothesis|belief in a just world]] to be correlated with aspects of religiousness.&lt;ref&gt;Begue, L. (2002). Beliefs in justice and faith in people: just world, religiosity and interpersonal trust. ''Personality and Individual Differences'', 32(3), 375-382.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kurst, J., Bjorck, J., &amp; Tan, S. (2000). Causal attributions for uncontrollable negative events. ''Journal of Psychology and Christianity'', 19, 47–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Risk-aversion===
Several studies have discovered a positive correlation between the degree of religiousness and [[Risk aversion]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Risk aversion and religion | journal = Journal of Risk and Uncertainty | first = Charles | last = Noussair |author2=Stefan T.

'''Religious satire''' is a form of [[satire]] targeted at [[religious]] [[belief]]s.&lt;ref name="Hodgart2009npn"/&gt; From the earliest times, at least since the plays of [[Aristophanes]], religion has been one of the three primary topics of literary satire, along with [[politics]] and [[sex]].&lt;ref name="Clark91p116"&gt;Clark (1991) [https://books.google.com/books?id=LOeLRDzui_wC&amp;pg=PA116 pp.116-8] quotation: {{quotation|...religion, politics, and sexuality are the primary stuff of literary satire. Among these sacret targets, matters costive and defecatory play an important part. ... from the earliest times, satirists have utilized scatological and bathroom humor. Aristophanes, always livid and nearly scandalous in his religious, political, and sexual references...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark73p20"&gt;Clark, John R. and Motto, Anna Lydia (1973) [https://books.google.com/books?id=A5NZAAAAMAAJ ''Satire--that blasted art''] p.20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark80p45"&gt;Clark, John R. and Motto, Anna Lydia (1980) [https://books.google.com/books?id=SnwhAQAAIAAJ ''Menippeans &amp; Their Satire: Concerning Monstrous Leamed Old Dogs and Hippocentaurs''], in Scholia satyrica, Volume 6, 3/4, 1980 p.45 quotation: {{quotation|[Chapple's book ''Soviet satire of the twenties'']...classifying the very ''topics'' his satirists satirized: housing, food, and fuel supplies, poverty, inflation, "hooliganism", public services, religion, stereotypes of nationals (the Englishman, German, &amp;c), &amp;c. Yet the truth of the matter is that no satirist worth his salt (Petronius, Chaucer, Rabelais, Swift, Leskov, Grass) ever avoids man's habits and living standards, or scants those delicate desiderata: religion, politics, and sex.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Satire which targets the [[clergy]] is a type of [[political satire]], while religious satire is that which targets religious beliefs.&lt;ref name="Hodgart2009npn"&gt;Hodgart (2009) [https://books.google.com/books?id=dGrCooK63TsC&amp;pg=PA39 p.39]&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious satire is also sometimes called philosophical satire. Religious satire can be the result of [[agnosticism]] or [[atheism]]. Religious satire surfaced during the [[Renaissance]], with works by Chaucer, Erasmus and Durer.

==Reactions, criticism and censorship==

Religious satire has been criticised by those who feel that sincerely held religious views should not 
be subject to ridicule.  In some cases religious satire has been censored - for example, Molière's play ''[[Tartuffe]]'' was banned in 1664.

The film ''[[Life of Brian]]'' was initially banned in Ireland, Norway, some states of the US, and some towns and councils of the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/mid/7530542.stm Vicar supports Life of Brian ban]&lt;/ref&gt;  In an interesting case of life mirroring art, activist groups who protested the film during its release bore striking similarities to some bands of religious zealots within the film itself.&lt;ref&gt;Dyke, C: ''Screening Scripture'', pp. 238-240. Trinity Press International, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  Like much religious satire, the intent of the film has been misinterpreted and distorted by protesters.  According to the [[Monty Python|Pythons]], ''Life of Brian'' is not a critique of religion so much as an indictment of the hysteria and bureaucratic excess that often surrounds it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The Secret Life of Brian |year= 2007 |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDCAJTrF1gg }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of [[freedom of speech]] was hotly debated by the UK Parliament during the passing of the [[Religious Hatred Bill]] in January 2006. Critics of the original version of the Bill (such as comedian [[Rowan Atkinson]]) feared that satirists could be prosecuted, but an amendment by the [[House of Lords]] making it clear that this was not the case was passed - by just one vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Votes on the Racial and Religious Hatred Bill | year = 2006 | url = http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/search.php?query=racial+and+religious+hatred+bill }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, [[Church of the SubGenius#Legal matters|Rachel Bevilacqua]], a member of the [[Church of the SubGenius]], known as Rev. Magdalen in the SubGenius hierarchy, lost custody and contact with her son after a district court judge took offense at her participation in the Church's [[X-Day (Church of the SubGenius)|X-Day]] festival.

[[Richard Dawkins]] frequently points out that there is no reason to exclude religion from objective studying like any other social phenomena.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2048">'''Sacralism''' is the confluence of [[separation of church and state|church and state]] wherein one is called upon to change the other.

'''Christian sacralism''' is, according to Verduin,&lt;ref&gt;Verduin, Leonard ''The anatomy of a hybrid : a study in church-state relationships'', Grand Rapids, Mich. : Eerdmans, (1976) {{ISBN|0-8028-1615-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[multicultural|hybrid]] product that resulted from the colossal change known as the [[Constantinian shift]] that began early in the fourth century AD, when Christianity was granted official tolerance in the [[Roman Empire]] by the [[Emperor Constantine]], and was completed by the [[Emperor Theodosius]]'s declaration in 392 outlawing paganism and making Christianity the official religion of the Empire.

A [[Latin]] saying that has often been used to describe the principle of sacralism is '''''cuius regio, eius religio''''', or "who has region, decides religion." The idea was that the ruler of each individual area would decide the religion of those under his control based upon his own faith.

Some scholars prefer the terms "'''sacred sex'''" or "'''sacred sexual rites'''" to "sacred prostitution" in cases where payment for services was not involved. 

==Ancient Near East==
[[File:Ishtar vase Louvre AO17000-detail.jpg|100px|thumb|[[Inanna]]/[[Ishtar]] depicted wearing the ceremonial [[headdress]] of the [[high priestess]]]]
[[Ancient Near East]]ern societies along the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] rivers featured many shrines and temples or ''houses of heaven'' dedicated to various [[deities]]. The 5th-century BC historian Herodotus's account and some other testimony from the [[Hellenistic Period]] and [[Late Antiquity]] suggest that ancient societies encouraged the practice of sacred sexual rites not only in [[Babylonia]] and [[Cyprus]], but throughout the [[Near East]].

According to [[Herodotus]], the rites performed at these temples included sexual intercourse, or what scholars later called sacred sexual rites:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The foulest Babylonian custom is that which compels every woman of the land to sit in the temple of [[Aphrodite]] and have intercourse with some stranger at least once in her life. Many women who are rich and proud and disdain to mingle with the rest, drive to the temple in covered carriages drawn by teams, and stand there with a great retinue of attendants.  But most sit down in the sacred plot of Aphrodite, with crowns of cord on their heads; there is a great multitude of women coming and going; passages marked by line run every way through the crowd, by which the men pass and make their choice.  Once a woman has taken her place there, she does not go away to her home before some stranger has cast money into her lap, and had intercourse with her outside the temple; but while he casts the money, he must say, "I invite you in the name of [[Mylitta]]".  It does not matter what sum the money is; the woman will never refuse, for that would be a sin, the money being by this act made sacred. So she follows the first man who casts it and rejects no one. After their intercourse, having discharged her sacred duty to the goddess, she goes away to her home; and thereafter there is no bribe however great that will get her. So then the women that are fair and tall are soon free to depart, but the uncomely have long to wait because they cannot fulfil the law; for some of them remain for three years, or four. There is a custom like this in some parts of Cyprus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]], ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+1.199 1.199], tr A.D. Godley (1920)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The British anthropologist [[James Frazer]] accumulated citations to prove this in a chapter of his magnum opus ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' (1890–1915),&lt;ref&gt;J.G. Frazer, ''The Golden Bough'', abridged edition (1922), [[s:The Golden Bough/Adonis in Cyprus|Chapter 31: Adonis in Cyprus]]; see also the more extensive treatment in the 3rd edition of ''The Golden Bough'', volumes 5 and 6 (published 1914). Frazer's argument and citations are reproduced in slightly clearer fashion by Fernando Henriques, ''Prostitution and Society: a study'' (3 vols., London : MacGibbon &amp; Kee, 1962–1968), vol. I, ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; and this has served as a starting point for several generations of scholars. Frazer and Henriques distinguished two major forms of sacred sexual rites: temporary rite of unwed girls (with variants such as dowry-sexual rite, or as public [[defloration]] of a bride), and lifelong sexual rite.&lt;ref&gt;Fernando Henriques, ''Prostitution and Society: a study'' (3 vols., London : MacGibbon &amp; Kee, 1962–1968), vol. I, ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Frazer took his sources mostly from authors of [[Late Antiquity]] (i.e. 150–500 AD), not from the Classical or [[Hellenistic period]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]] and [[Strabo]] are the only sources mentioned by Frazer that were active prior to the 2nd century AD; his other sources include [[Deipnosophistae|Athenaeus]], [[De Dea Syria|pseudo-Lucian]], [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]], and the Christian church historians [[Sozomen]] and [[Socrates of Constantinople]].&lt;/ref&gt; This raises questions as to whether the phenomenon of temple sexual rites can be generalized to the whole of the ancient world, as earlier scholars typically did. 

The research of Daniel Arnaud, Vinciane Pirenne-Delforge, Julia Assante, Stephanie Budin&lt;ref name = "Budin"/&gt; and others has cast the whole tradition of scholarship that defined the concept of sacred prostitution into doubt. Budin regards the concept of sacred prostitution as a myth—arguing that the practices described in the sources simply never existed. A more nuanced view, espoused by Pirenne-Delforge, suggests that ritual sex did exist in the Near East, but not in the Greek or Roman worlds in classical or Hellenistic times.&lt;ref name = "Budin"/&gt;

===Sacred marriage===

The practice of sacred prostitution has not been substantiated in any [[Ancient Near East]]ern cultures, despite many popular descriptions of the habit.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Frazer]] (1922), ''[[The Golden Bough]]'', 3e, [[s:The Golden Bough/Adonis in Cyprus|Chapter 31: Adonis in Cyprus]]&lt;/ref&gt; Through the twentieth century, scholars generally believed that a form of ''sacred marriage'' rite or ''[[hieros gamos]]'' was staged between the king of a [[Sumer]]ian city-state and the High Priestess of [[Inanna]], the [[Mesopotamian mythology|Sumerian goddess]] of sexual love, fertility, and warfare, but no certain evidence has survived to prove that sexual intercourse was included. Along the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] rivers there was a temple of Eanna, meaning ''house of heaven''&lt;ref&gt;é-an-na = sanctuary ('house' + 'Heaven'[='An'] + genitive) [John Halloran's Sumerian Lexicon v. 3.0 – see link below]&lt;/ref&gt; dedicated to [[Inanna]] in the Eanna District of [[Uruk]].&lt;ref&gt;Modern-day [[Warka (Iraq)|Warka]], Biblical [[Erech]].&lt;/ref&gt;

While there may well have been some religious prostitution in the temples of [[Inanna]]/[[Ishtar]], Assante suggests the concept of the 'sacred marriage' (''[[hieros gamos]]'') has been misunderstood. It was previously believed to have been a custom whereby the king coupled with the high priestess to represent the union of [[Dumuzid, the Shepherd|Dumuzid]] with [[Inanna]] (later called [[Ishtar]]).&lt;ref name=Day_2004&gt;John Day, "Does the Old Testament Refer to Sacred Prostitution and Did it Actually Exist in Ancient Israel?", in ''Biblical and Near Eastern Essays: Studies in Honour of Kevin J. Cathcart'', eds. Carmel McCarthy &amp; John F Healey (Continuum International Publishing, 2004), 2–21.&lt;/ref&gt; It is much more likely that these unions never occurred but were embellishments to the image of the king; hymns which praise Middle Eastern kings for coupling with the goddess [[Ishtar]] often speak of him as running 320 kilometres, offering sacrifices, feasting with the sun-god [[Utu]], and receiving a royal crown from [[Anu|An]], all in a single day. One scholar comments: "No one, to the best of my knowledge, has been so wooden-minded to propose that human actors played the role of Utu and An at the banquet."&lt;ref&gt;Sweet, R. "A New Look at the 'Sacred Marriage' in Ancient Mesopotamia", in E. Robbins and S. Sandahl, eds., Corolla Torontonensis. Studies in Honour of Ronald Morton Smith (Toronto, 1994) 85–104.&lt;/ref&gt; Not all authors are convinced, however.&lt;ref name=Day_2004 /&gt;

Other modern historians argue that the temple did house priestesses of the goddess, but there is no evidence that they performed any kind of sexual services in any [[Cult (religious practice)|cult]].&lt;ref&gt;Budin, Stephanie Lynn, ''The Myth of Sacred Prostitution in Antiquity''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Assante, Julia 1998. "The kar.kid/[kh]arimtu, Prostitute or Single Woman? A Reconsideration of the Evidence", ''Ugarit-Forschungen''; 30:5–96&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Assante, Julia 2003. "From Whores to Hierodules: the Historiographic Invention of Mesopotamian Female Sex Professionals", pp. 13–47 in ''Ancient Art and Its Historiography'', edited A. A. Donahue and Mark D. Fullerton.

Neukirchen-Vluyn, Germany: Kevelaer&lt;/ref&gt;

===Code of Hammurabi===
In [[code of Hammurabi|Hammurabi's code of laws]], the rights and good name of female sacred sexual priestesses were protected.  The same legislation that protected married women from slander applied to them and their children. They could inherit property from their fathers, collect income from land worked by their brothers, and dispose of property. These rights have been described as extraordinary, taking into account the role of women at the time.&lt;ref&gt;The Sacred Prostitute: Eternal Aspect of the Feminine By Nancy Qualls-Corbett&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hebrew Bible===
The [[Hebrew Bible]] uses two different words for prostitute, ''zonah'' (זונה)&amp;lrm;&lt;ref name="zanah"&gt;Associated with the corresponding verb ''zanah''.{{cite web|title=Genesis 1:1 (KJV)|url=https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?t=kjv&amp;strongs=h2181|website=[[Blue Letter Bible]]|accessdate=5 April 2018|language=en}} incorporating [[Strong's concordance]] (1890) and [[Gesenius]]'s Lexicon (1857). Also transliterated ''qĕdeshah'', ''q&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;deshah'', ''qědēšā'' ,''qedashah'', ''kadeshah'', ''kadesha'', ''qedesha'', ''kdesha''. A modern liturgical pronunciation would be ''k'deysha''.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''kedeshah'' (or ''qedesha'') (קדשה)&amp;lrm;.&lt;ref name="zanah" /&gt; The word ''zonah'' simply meant an ordinary prostitute or ''loose woman''.&lt;ref name="zanah" /&gt; But the word ''kedeshah'' literally means ''consecrated'' (feminine form), from the Semitic root ''[[Q-D-Sh|q-d-sh]]'' (קדש)&amp;lrm; meaning ''holy'' or ''set apart''.&lt;ref name="zanah" /&gt; In spite of the cultic significance of a ''kedeshah'' to a follower of the [[Canaanite religion]], two verses makes it clear that cultic prostitution had no place within Yahweh's worship. {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|23:17-18|NIV}}:

{{quote|None of the daughters of Israel shall be a ''kedeshah'', nor shall any of the sons of Israel be a ''kadesh''.

You shall not bring the hire of a prostitute (''zonah'') or the wages of a dog (''kelev'') into the house of the Lord your God to pay a vow, for both of these are an abomination to the Lord your God.}}

[[Stephen O.

Some scholars see the injunctions against foreign worship, including male sacred prostitution, as possibly the original cause of what would later become Judaism's condemnation of sexual contact between men.&lt;ref name="rictornorton.co.uk"/&gt;{{Unreliable source|sure=y|reason=topic is out of author's scope and area of expertise, essay is unsourced and does not represent scholarly consensus re: ancient history and Biblical studies|date=August 2017}}

The Law of Moses (Deuteronomy) was not universally observed in Hebrew culture under the rule of King David's dynasty, as recorded in Kings.  In fact Judah had lost "the Book of the Law".  During the reign of King Josiah, The high priest Hilkiah discovers it in "the House of the Lord" and realizes that the people have disobeyed, particularly regarding Sacred Prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;2 Kings 22:8&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Sweeney, Marvin A. King Josiah of Judah, Oxford University Press, 2001, p.137. {{ISBN|978-0-19-513324-0}}]&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples of male temple prostitution ("sodomites" [KJV, GNV]) being banned under King Josiah are recorded to have been commonplace since the reign of King Rehoboam of Judah (King Solomon's son). &lt;ref&gt;1 Kings 14:24, 1 Kings 15:12 and 2 Kings 23:7 &lt;/ref&gt;.  Modern bible translations refer to King Josiah's bans on "male temple prostitutes" [NRSV] or similarly "male shrine prostitutes" [NIV], where as older translations refer to the ban of "Sodomites" and "the Houses of the Sodomites" [KJV, GNV].  Under the polytheistic religious practices that were commonplace, homosexuality experienced a degree of cultural acceptance along with heterosexuality among the Hebrew tribes, but sacred prostitution was not allowed in conjunction with the worship of Yahweh, where these had been expressly forbidden in Deuteronomy, their sacred Book of Law under King Josiah.

In the [[Book of Ezekiel]], [[Oholah and Oholibah]] appear as the allegorical brides of God who represent [[Samaria (ancient city)|Samaria]] and Jerusalem. They became prostitutes in Egypt, engaging in prostitution from their youth. The prophet Ezekiel condemns both as guilty of religious and political alliance with heathen nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classic.net.bible.org/dictionary.php?word=OHOLIBAH|title=NETBible: Oholibah|publisher=|accessdate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

So within Hebrew cultures involving pagan religions, both homosexual and heterosexual pagan temple prostitution experienced periods of acceptance, and periods of banishment, as under King Josiah.

===Sumer===
According to the noted Assyriologist [[Samuel Noah Kramer]], kings in the ancient Near Eastern region of [[Sumer]] established their legitimacy by taking part in a ritual sexual act in the temple of the fertility goddess Ishtar every year on the tenth day of the New Year festival [[Akitu]].&lt;ref&gt;S. N. Kramer, ''The Sacred Marriage Rite: Aspects of Faith, Myth and Ritual in Ancient Sumer''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hittites===
The [[Hittites]] practiced sacred prostitution as part of a cult of deities, including the worship of a mated pair of deities, a bull god and a lion goddess, while in later days it was the mother-goddess who became prominent, representing fertility, and (in Phoenicia) the goddess who presided over human birth.&lt;ref&gt;Nagendra Kr Singh, ''Divine Prostitution'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=nYEdPoGAaz0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false page 6], (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ancient Greece and Hellenistic World ==

===Ancient Greece===
{{Main|Prostitution in ancient Greece#Temple prostitution in Corinth}}
In [[ancient Greece]], sacred prostitution was known in the city of [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]] where the [[Temple of Aphrodite (Corinth)|Temple of Aphrodite]] employed a significant number of female servants, ''hetairai'', during [[classical antiquity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Strabo|title=Geographica|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/8F*.html|location=VIII.6.20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek term ''hierodoulos'' or ''hierodule'' has sometimes been taken to mean ''sacred holy woman'', but it is more likely to refer to a former slave freed from slavery in order to be ''dedicated'' to a god.&lt;ref name = "Budin"&gt;Stephanie Budin, ''The Myth of Sacred Prostitution in Antiquity'' (Cambridge University Press, 2009); more briefly the case that there was no sacred prostitution in Greco-Roman Ephesus by S.M. Baugh (1999) http://www.etsjets.org/files/JETS-PDFs/42/42-3/42-3-pp443-460_JETS.pdf; see also the book review by Vinciane Pirenne-Delforge, [http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2009/2009-04-28.html Bryn Mawr Classical Review, April 28, 2009].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hellenistic world===
In the Greek-influenced and colonized world, "sacred prostitution" was known in [[Cyprus]] (Greek-settled since 1100 BC), [[Sicily]] (Hellenized since 750 BC), in the [[Kingdom of Pontus]] (8th century BC) and in [[Cappadocia]] (c. 330 BC hellenized).{{cn|date=April 2017}}

==Ancient Rome and late antiquity==

===Ancient Rome===
{{Main|Prostitution in ancient Rome#Prostitution and religion}}

===Late antiquity===
The Roman emperor [[Constantine I|Constantine]] closed down a number of temples to [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] or similar deities in the 4th century AD, as the Christian church historian [[Eusebius]] proudly noted.&lt;ref name="3.55" /&gt; [[Eusebius]] also claimed that the [[Phoenicia]]n cities of [[Afqa|Aphaca]] and [[Baalbek|Heliopolis]] ([[Baalbek]]) continued to practise temple prostitution until the emperor [[Constantine I|Constantine]] put an end to the rite in the 4th century AD.&lt;ref name="3.55"&gt;[[Eusebius]], ''Life of Constantine'', [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf201.iv.vi.iii.lv.html 3.55] and [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf201.iv.vi.iii.lviii.html 3.58]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asia==

===India===
In Southern [[India]] and the eastern Indian state of [[Odisha]], [[devadasi]] is the practice of hierodulic prostitution, with similar customary forms such as basavi,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is child hierodulic servitude?|url=http://anti-slaverysociety.addr.com/hieroras.htm|website=[[Anti-Slavery Society]]|accessdate=5 April 2018|date= |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160102084104/http://anti-slaverysociety.addr.com/hieroras.htm |archive-date=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and involves dedicating pre-pubescent and young adolescent girls from villages in a ritual marriage to a deity or a temple, who then work in the temple and function as spiritual guides, dancers, and prostitutes servicing male devotees in the temple. [[Human Rights Watch]] reports claim that devadasis are forced into this service and, at least in some cases, to practice prostitution for upper-caste members.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch. [http://hrw.org/campaigns/caste/presskit.htm Caste: Asia's Hidden Apartheid]&lt;/ref&gt; The devadasis were originally seen as interluders who allowed upper-caste men to have contact with the gods. Though they did develop sexual relations with other men, they were not looked upon with lust. The system was criticised by British rulers, leading to decline in support for the system and the devadasis were forced into entering prostitution for survival.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.in/books?id=Fq5rDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT143&amp;dq=devadasi+sexual+relations&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiBsOfhq5HdAhWBeisKHbRCDSMQ6AEIPzAE#v=onepage&amp;q=devadasi%20sexual%20relations&amp;f=false Women, Music, Culture: An Introduction] by Julie C.

Various state governments in [[India]] enacted laws to ban this practice both prior to India's independence and more recently. They include Bombay Devdasi Act, 1934, Devdasi (Prevention of dedication) Madras Act, 1947, Karnataka Devdasi (Prohibition of dedication) Act, 1982, and Andhra Pradesh Devdasi (Prohibition of dedication) Act, 1988.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women.

===Japan===
Sacred prostitution was once practised by the [[Miko]] within traditional [[Shinto]] in [[Japan]]. There were once Shinto beliefs that prostitution was sacred, and there used to be lodgings for the temple prostitutes on the shrine grounds. This traditional practise came to an end during the beginning of the [[Meiji era]], due to the encroachment of Western Christian morality, and the government implementing the ''[[Shinbutsu bunri]]''; which, among other things, drastically decreased the roles of the Miko, and modified Shinto beliefs until it became what is now colloquially referred to as [[State Shinto]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fuzoku-style-jp.com/history/shinto.html Ways of thinking that connect religion and prostitution]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kuly |first1=Lisa |title=Locating Transcendence in Japanese Minzoku Geinô : Yamabushi and Miko Kagura |journal=Ethnologies |date=2003 |volume=25 |issue=1 |page=198 |doi=10.7202/007130ar |url=http://www.erudit.org/revue/ethno/2003/v25/n1/007130ar.html |language=en |issn=1481-5974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s and early 1980s, some religious cults practiced sacred prostitution as an instrument to recruit new converts.

They later abolished the practice due to the growing [[AIDS]] epidemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In [[Ventura County]], California, Wilbur and [[Mary Ellen Tracy]] established their own temple, the ''Church Of The Most High Goddess'', in the wake of what they described as a divine revelation.

&lt;!-- [[Image:BogdanKacmajor.jpg|thumb|Bogdan Kacmajor]] --&gt; 
The '''Sekta Niebo''' (Heaven Sect) ([[Polish language|Polish]] ''Zbór Chrześcijański Leczenia Duchem Bożym''; "Christian Church of Healing by Spirit of God") was a small religious movement founded in 1990 by [[faith healer]] [[Bogdan Kacmajor]], who believed he was a prophet chosen by God and a reincarnation of the prophet [[Elijah]].

==Beliefs and practices==
Members of the sect believed that by the year 2000 the world would come to an end. Their goal was to establish a commune of chosen people. As a symbol of their new life they took new names and destroyed their identity documents. Total submission to Kacmajor was required. Members married each other, refused to send children to public school (as Kacmajor stated, "in chemistry class they teach that you can't turn water into wine, in physics class they teach that you can't walk on water") and refused to take any medical treatment (Kacmajor was convinced that he can heal even AIDS). Niebo gathered approximately 50 members.

==Decline==
Because of their total social alienation the group soon started to have troubles with the law. Reports of kidnapping and children being kept prisoner started circulating. The Catholic Church and several church-related movements started a campaign against the community which resulted in bad fame and financial problems. As of 2008 the community does not exist and there are several court cases against Kacmajor.

{{No footnotes|date=July 2009}}
[[Image:Soulcatchertlingit.jpg|thumb|400px| A [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]] soulcatcher, made by Heendei, of the Raven moiety and the Deisheetaan clan.]]

A '''Soulcatcher''' (''Haboolm  Ksinaalgat'', 'keeper of breath') is an [[amulet]] ''(Aatxasxw)'' used by the [[shaman]] (Halayt) of the Pacific Northwest Coast of [[British Columbia]] and [[Alaska]]. It is believed that all soulcatchers were constructed by the [[Tsimshian]] tribe, and traded to the other tribes.

==Construction==
Soulcatchers were constructed of a tube of bear [[femur]], incised on one or both sides, and often ornamented with [[abalone]] shell.  Bears had powerful [[shaman]]ic connotations among the people of the Northwest Coast.
  
Soulcatchers were decorated with a [[sisiutl]]-like animal: a land-otter or bear head at both ends of the tube, and an [[anthropomorph]]ic face in the middle.  This form may have represented the ability to shift shapes, or the mythological land-otter [[canoe]], implying the ability to travel between the three realms: air/god realm ''(kijek)'', earth/human/animal realm ''(takijek)'', and water/spirit realm ''(tekijek)''. The land-otter was the source of all shamanic power.

A [[shaman]]'s helper spirit may have resided in the central head.

The soulcatcher was plugged at both ends with shredded [[Cedar wood|cedar]] bark, to contain the lost soul, or to hold a malevolent spirit "sucked out" of a patient.  The amulet was usually worn as a [[necklace]]. Soulcatchers ranged in length from 16&amp;nbsp;cm to 21.6&amp;nbsp;cm (6{{frac|5|8}}" to 8{{frac|1|2}}").  

There are a few examples of wood soulcatchers, and a Haida example covered with [[copper]] sheeting.

==Use==
Sickness incurable by secular (herbal) means was believed to be caused by "soul loss" through:
*Dreaming, which was thought to be the soul leaving the body and traveling to the spirit world. If the soul was unable to return to the body by morning (due to disorientation or supernatural interference), chronic illness would follow.
*Being frightened out of the body
*Being enticed out by [[witchcraft]]

To cure the patient, the [[shaman]] would wear the soulcatcher as a necklace.  He would then travel to the spirit world by calling helper spirits using [[trance]] music, employing helper-spirit masks, and magical implements such as staffs.  Shaman might also work in groups, constructing a representation of a shaman's Land-Otter canoe and "[[dantsikw]]" spirit boards (see [[sisiutl]]) as a vehicle to travel to the spirit world.  Once the errant soul was located, the shaman would "suck" the soul into the soulcatcher, and return to the patient.  The soul would then be "blown" back into the patient.  

Another use of the soulcatcher was to suck malevolent spirits out of a patient.

The '''United Religions Initiative''' ('''URI''') is a global grassroots [[interfaith dialogue|interfaith]] network that cultivates peace and justice by engaging people to bridge religious and cultural differences and work together for the good of their communities and the world. The purpose of the United Religions Initiative is to promote enduring, daily interfaith cooperation, to end religiously motivated violence and to create cultures of peace, justice and healing for the Earth and all living beings.

This mission is carried out through local and global initiatives that build the capacity of more than 800 member groups and organizations, called Cooperation Circles,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uri.org/Cooperation_Circles.html Cooperation Circles], United Religions Initiative&lt;/ref&gt; to engage in community action such as conflict resolution and reconciliation, environmental sustainability, education, women’s and youth programs, and advocacy for human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.uri.org/about_uri/charter| title=United Religions Initiative Charter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guided by the vision of founder [[William E. Swing]], the URI Charter was developed through a series of international conferences and consultation with transformative organizational design practitioners [[David Cooperrider]] and Diana Whitney.&lt;ref&gt;Cooperrider, David L. and Diana Kaplin Whitney, ''Appreciative inquiry: a positive revolution in change'', page 31, Berret-Koehler Publishers Inc., 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The URI Charter was signed by more than two-hundred people present, and hundreds more joining over the Internet, at a ceremony in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA on June 26, 2000.&lt;ref&gt;''Pittsburgh Post Gazette'', June 28, 2000, Ervin Dyer, Charter Signed for Religious Coalitions {{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1129&amp;dat=20000627&amp;id=nVYNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=MG8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4478,4862332|title=Google archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizational structure==

The URI is composed of 800+ Cooperation Circles (CCs) in 100+ countries worldwide, as of October 2017. CCs are groups of seven or more individuals representing three or more different faiths or spiritual expressions (including atheists and agnostics). CC members are located in one of eight regions; some span across multiple regions:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uri.org/Cooperation_Circles.html Cooperation Circles], United Religions Initiative&lt;/ref&gt;

* Africa
* Asia
* Europe
* Latin America &amp; the Caribbean
* Middle East &amp; North Africa
* Multiregion
* North America
* Southeast Asia &amp; the Pacific

==Activities==

Before the formal charter signing in 2000, URI supporters around the world participated together in a project called "72 Hours for Peace", in which more than 250 local organizations united in projects promoting peace and justice during the turn of the millennium.&lt;ref&gt;Talcott, Sarah, ''Building the Interfaith Youth Movement: Beyond Dialogue to Action'', p78, ed. by Eboo Patel and Patrice Brodeur, Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc., 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Baldung Hexen 1508 kol.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|''Witches'' by [[Hans Baldung]]. Woodcut, 1508]]
'''Witchcraft''' or '''witchery''' broadly means the practice of and belief in [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] skills and abilities exercised by solitary practitioners and groups. ''Witchcraft'' is a broad term that varies culturally and societally, and thus can be difficult to define with precision,&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=LsjagvvkveEC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=witchcraft+definition&amp;ots=aw4oz13kOS&amp;sig=2CWBjLB2TIsUt1aNz_nyUPxOf5E&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=witchcraft%20definition&amp;f=false Witchcraft in the Middle Ages], Jeffrey Russell, p.4-10.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[cross-cultural]] assumptions about the meaning or significance of the term should be applied with caution. Witchcraft often occupies a religious [[divination|divinatory]] or medicinal role,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and is often present within societies and groups whose [[cultural framework]] includes a magical [[world view]].&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt;

==Concept==
[[File:John William Waterhouse - Magic Circle.JPG|thumb|upright|''[[The Magic Circle (Waterhouse painting)|The Magic Circle]]'' by [[John William Waterhouse]], 1886]]

The concept of witchcraft and the belief in its existence have persisted throughout recorded history. They have been present or central at various times and in many diverse forms among cultures and religions worldwide, including both "primitive" and "highly advanced" cultures,&lt;ref&gt;Bengt Ankarloo &amp; Stuart Clark, Witchcraft and Magic in Europe: Biblical and Pagan Societies", University of Philadelphia Press, 2001, p xiii: ''"Magic is central not only in 'primitive' societies but in 'high cultural' societies as well"''&lt;/ref&gt; and continue to have an important role in many cultures today.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Bengt Ankarloo &amp; Stuart Clark, Witchcraft and Magic in Europe: Biblical and Pagan Societies", University of Philadelphia Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Scientifically, the existence of magical powers and witchcraft are generally believed to [[pseudoscience|lack credence]] and to be unsupported by high-quality [[scientific method|experimental testing]], although individual witchcraft practices [[Medical explanations of bewitchment|and effects]] may be open to [[scientific knowledge|scientific explanation]] or explained via [[mentalism]] and [[Psychological theories of magic|psychology]].

Historically, the [[Christian views on magic|predominant concept of witchcraft in the Western world]] derives from [[Old Testament]] [[biblical law|laws]] against witchcraft, and entered the mainstream when belief in witchcraft gained Church approval in the [[Early Modern Period]]. It posits a [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|theosophical]] [[conflict between good and evil]], where witchcraft was generally [[evil]] and often associated with [[Devil in Christianity|the Devil]] and [[Devil worship]]. This culminated in deaths, [[torture]] and [[scapegoating]] (casting blame for human misfortune),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeffrey Burton Russell |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/646051/witchcraft |title=Witchcraft – Encyclopædia Britannica |website=Britannica.com |accessdate=2013-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pócs 1999, pp. 9–12.&lt;/ref&gt; and many years of large scale [[Witch trials in the early modern period|witch-trials]] and [[witch-hunting|witch hunts]], especially in [[Protestant]] Europe, before largely ceasing during the European [[Age of Enlightenment]]. Christian views in the modern day are diverse and cover the gamut of views from intense belief and opposition (especially from Christian [[fundamentalist]]s) to non-belief, and in some churches even approval. From the mid-20th century, witchcraft – sometimes called contemporary witchcraft to clearly distinguish it from older beliefs – became the name of a branch of [[modern paganism]].  It is most notably practiced in the [[Wiccan]] and modern witchcraft traditions, and no longer practices in secrecy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Margot Adler|Adler, Margot]] (1979) ''Drawing Down the Moon: Witches, Druids, Goddess-Worshippers, and Other Pagans in America Today''. Boston: Beacon Press. pp. 45–47, 84–5, 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Western mainstream Christian view is far from the only societal perspective about witchcraft. Many cultures worldwide continue to have widespread practices and cultural beliefs that are loosely translated into English as "witchcraft", although the English translation masks a very great diversity in their forms, magical beliefs, practices, and place in their societies. During the [[History of colonialism|Age of Colonialism]], many cultures across the globe were exposed to the modern Western world via [[colonialism]], usually accompanied and often preceded by intensive [[Christianity and colonialism|Christian missionary activity]] ''(see "[[Christianization#Colonial era (16th−19th centuries)|Christianization]]")''. Beliefs related to witchcraft and magic in these cultures were at times influenced by the prevailing Western concepts. Witch hunts, scapegoating, and killing or shunning of suspected witches still occurs in the modern era,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Pearlman |first=Jonathan |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/australiaandthepacific/papuanewguinea/9987294/Papua-New-Guinea-urged-to-halt-witchcraft-violence-after-latest-sorcery-case.html |title=Papua New Guinea urged to halt witchcraft violence after latest 'sorcery' case |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2013-04-11 |accessdate=2013-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; with killings both of victims [[Murder for body parts#Medicine murder|for their supposedly magical body parts]], and of suspected witchcraft practitioners.

Suspicion of modern medicine due to beliefs about illness being due to witchcraft also continues in many countries to this day, with tragic [[healthcare]] consequences.

== Etymology and definitions ==
{{Further information|Witch (word)}}
The word ''witch'' is of uncertain origin. There are numerous etymologies that it could be derived from. One popular belief is that it is "related to the English words wit, wise, wisdom [Germanic root *weit-, *wait-, *wit-; Indo-European root *weid-, *woid-, *wid-]," so "craft of the wise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/12416396|title=Power in the Name: The Origin and Meaning of the Word &amp;quot;Witch&amp;quot;|first=Michael|last=Dilts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another is from the [[Old English]] wiccecræft, a compound of "wicce" ("witch") and "cræft" ("craft").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harper |first=Douglas|title=witchcraft (n.)|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=witchcraft&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|work=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[anthropology|anthropological]] terminology, witches differ from sorcerers in that they don't use physical tools or actions to curse; their [[maleficium (sorcery)|maleficium]] is perceived as extending from some intangible inner quality, and one may be unaware of  being a witch, or may have been convinced of his/her nature by the suggestion of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cohn |first=Norman |authorlink=Norman Cohn |title=Europe's Inner Demons |pages=176–9 |date=1975 |isbn=978-0-465-02131-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition was pioneered in a study of central African magical beliefs by [[E. E. Evans-Pritchard]], who cautioned that it might not correspond with normal English usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Evans-Pritchard |first=Edward Evan |title=Witchcraft, Oracles and Magic Among the Azande |date=1937 |pages=8–9 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-874029-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians of European witchcraft have found the anthropological definition difficult to apply to European witchcraft, where witches could equally use (or be accused of using) physical techniques, as well as some who really had attempted to cause harm by thought alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thomas |first=Keith |authorlink=Keith Thomas (historian) |date=1997 |title=Religion and the Decline of Magic |pages=464–5 |location=Oxford |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-297-00220-8}}; Ankarloo, Bengt and Henningsen, Gustav (1990) ''Early Modern European Witchcraft: Centres and Peripheries''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. pp. 1, 14.&lt;/ref&gt; European witchcraft is seen by historians and anthropologists as an [[ideology]] for explaining misfortune; however, this ideology has manifested in diverse ways, as described below.&lt;ref name="Pocs"&gt;Pócs 1999 pp. 9–10. The first three categories were proposed by [[Richard Kieckhefer]], the fourth added by Christina Larner.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

=== Alleged practices ===
[[File:A Witch.jpg|thumb|''A Witch'', 1902, by [[Edward Robert Hughes]]]]
Historically the witchcraft label has been applied to practices people believe influence the mind, body, or property of others against their will—or practices that the person doing the labeling believes undermine social or religious order. Some modern commentators{{who|date=April 2011}} believe the malefic nature of witchcraft is a Christian projection. The concept of a magic-worker influencing another person's body or property against their will was clearly present in many cultures, as traditions in both folk magic and religious magic have the purpose of countering malicious magic or identifying malicious magic users. Many examples appear in early texts, such as those from [[ancient Egypt]] and [[Babylonia]]. Malicious magic users can become a credible cause for disease, sickness in animals, bad luck, sudden death, impotence and other such misfortunes. Witchcraft of a more benign and socially acceptable sort may then be employed to turn the malevolence aside, or identify the supposed evil-doer so that punishment may be carried out. The folk magic used to identify or protect against malicious magic users is often indistinguishable from that used by the witches themselves.

{{quote|It is argued here that the medical arts played a significant and sometimes pivotal role in the witchcraft controversies of seventeenth century New England. Not only were physicians and surgeons the principal professional arbiters for determining natural versus preternatural signs and symptoms of disease, they occupied key legislative, judicial, and ministerial roles relating to witchcraft proceedings. Forty six male physicians, surgeons, and apothecaries are named in court transcripts or other contemporary source materials relating to New England witchcraft. These practitioners served on coroners' inquests, performed autopsies, took testimony, issued writs, wrote letters, or committed people to prison, in addition to diagnosing and treating patients. Some practitioners are simply mentioned in passing.&lt;ref&gt;Gevitz, N. ""The Devil Hath Laughed at the Physicians": Witchcraft and Medical Practice in Seventeenth-Century New England." Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences, vol. 55 no. 1, 2000, pp. 5–36. Project MUSE, muse.jhu.edu/article/15172.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There has also existed in popular belief the concept of [[white witch]]es and white witchcraft, which is strictly benevolent. Many neopagan witches strongly identify with this concept, and profess [[ethical code]]s that prevent them from performing magic on a person without their request.

Where belief in malicious magic practices exists, such practitioners are typically forbidden by law as well as hated and feared by the general populace, while beneficial magic is tolerated or even accepted wholesale by the people&amp;nbsp;– even if the orthodox establishment opposes it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QqPbJQkSo8EC&amp;pg=PA203&amp;lpg=PA203&amp;dq=alleged+practices+witchcraft#v=onepage&amp;q=alleged%20practices%20witchcraft&amp;f=false|title=Witches, Druids and King Arthur|last=Hutton|first=Ronald|date=2006-09-15|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9781852855550|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Spell casting ====
{{See also|Magic (paranormal)}}

Probably the most widely known characteristic of a witch was the ability to cast a [[spell (paranormal)|spell]], "spell" being the word used to signify the means employed to carry out a magical action. A spell could consist of a set of words, a formula or verse, or a ritual action, or any combination of these.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary, the Compact Edition'', Oxford University Press, p. 2955, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; Spells traditionally were cast by many methods, such as by the inscription of [[runes]] or [[sigil (magic)|sigils]] on an object to give it magical powers; by the immolation or binding of a wax or clay image ([[poppet]]) of a person to affect him or her magically; by the recitation of [[incantation]]s; by the performance of physical [[ritual]]s; by the employment of magical [[herb]]s as amulets or [[potion]]s; by gazing at mirrors, swords or other specula ([[scrying]]) for purposes of divination; and by many other means.&lt;ref&gt;for instance, see [[Georg Luck|Luck, Georg]], ''Arcana Mundi: Magic and the Occult in the Greek and Roman Worlds; a Collection of Ancient Texts'', Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985, 2006; also Kittredge, G. L., ''Witchcraft in Old and New England'', New York: Russell &amp; Russell, 1929, 1957, 1958; and Davies, Owen, ''Witchcraft, Magic and Culture, 1736–1951'', Manchester University Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Necromancy (conjuring the dead) ====
Strictly speaking, "[[necromancy]]" is the practice of conjuring the spirits of the dead for [[divination]] or [[prophecy]]&amp;nbsp;– although the term has also been applied to raising the dead for other purposes. The biblical [[Witch of Endor]] performed it (1 Sam. 28), and it is among the witchcraft practices condemned by [[Ælfric of Eynsham]]:&lt;ref&gt;

==== Demonology ====
{{main article|Demonology}}
In [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]], sorcery came to be associated with [[heresy]] and [[apostasy]] and to be viewed as evil. Among the [[Catholics]], Protestants, and [[secular]] leadership of the [[Europe]]an Late [[Medieval]]/[[Early Modern]] period, fears about witchcraft rose to fever pitch and sometimes led to large-scale [[witch-hunt]]s. The key century was the fifteenth, which saw a dramatic rise in awareness and terror of witchcraft, culminating in the publication of the ''Malleus Maleficarum'' but prepared by such fanatical popular preachers as Bernardino of Siena.&lt;ref&gt;For this dramatic rise in witchcraft consciousness during the fifteenth century and Bernardino's critical role in it, see Chapter 2 (pp. 52–108) Franco Mormando, ''The Preacher's Demons: Bernardino of Siena and the Social Underworld of Early Renaissance Italy''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1999. {{ISBN|0-226-53854-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout this time, it was increasingly believed that Christianity was engaged in an apocalyptic battle against the Devil and his secret army of witches, who had entered into a [[Deal with the Devil|diabolical pact]]. In total, tens or hundreds of thousands of people were executed, and others were imprisoned, tortured, banished, and had lands and possessions confiscated. The majority of those accused were women, though in some regions the majority were men.&lt;ref name="gibbons"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barstow, Anne Llewellyn (1994) ''Witchcraze: A New History of the European Witch Hunts'' San Francisco:Pandora. p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; In early modern [[Scots_language|Scots]], the word [[Warlock]] came to be used as the male equivalent of [[witch (word)|witch]] (which can be male or female, but is used predominantly for females).&lt;ref&gt;McNeill, F. Marian, ''The Silver Bough: A Four Volume Study of the National and Local Festivals of Scotland'', Glasgow: William Maclellan,1957, vol 1; also Chambers, Robert, ''Domestic Annals of Scotland'', Edinburgh: 1861, and Sinclair, George, ''Satan's Invisible World Discovered'', Edinburgh, 1871&lt;/ref&gt; From this use, the word passed into [[Romanticism|Romantic]] literature and ultimately 20th-century [[Warlock (disambiguation)|popular culture]]. Accusations of witchcraft were often combined with other charges of heresy against such groups as the [[Cathars]] and [[Waldensians]].

The ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]],'' (Latin for "Hammer of The Witches") was a witch-hunting manual written in 1486 by two German monks, Heinrich Kramer and Jacob Sprenger. It was used by both Catholics and Protestants&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H0IAjBexFTgC&amp;lpg=PA27&amp;dq=malleus%20maleficarum%20protestant&amp;pg=PA27#v=onepage&amp;q=malleus%20maleficarum%20protestant&amp;f=false |title=The Emergence of Modern Europe: C. 1500 to 1788|publisher= Britannica Educational Publishing |page=27 |accessdate=2013-06-29|isbn=9781615303434 |date=2011-01-15 |editor-last1= Campbell|editor-first1=Heather M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; for several hundred years, outlining how to identify a witch, what makes a woman more likely than a man to be a witch, how to put a witch on trial, and how to punish a witch. The book defines a witch as evil and typically female. The book became the handbook for secular courts throughout Renaissance Europe, but was not used by the Inquisition, which even cautioned against relying on the work,&lt;ref&gt;'In 1538 the Spanish Inquisition cautioned its members not to believe everything the Malleus said, even when it presented apparently firm evidence.', Jolly, Raudvere, &amp; Peters(eds.), 'Witchcraft and magic in Europe: the Middle Ages', page 241 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; and was later officially condemned by the Catholic Church in 1490.

In the modern Western world, witchcraft accusations have often accompanied the [[satanic ritual abuse]] [[moral panic]]. Such accusations are a counterpart to [[blood libel]] of various kinds, which may be found throughout history across the globe.

[[File:Rila Monastery wall painting.jpg|thumb|A painting in the [[Rila Monastery]] in [[Bulgaria]], condemning witchcraft and traditional [[folk magic]]]]
Throughout the [[early modern period]], the [[Early Modern English|English]] term "witch" was not exclusively negative in meaning, and could also indicate [[cunning folk]]. As Alan McFarlane noted, "There were a number of interchangeable terms for these practitioners, 'white', 'good', or 'unbinding' witches, blessers, wizards, sorcerers, however 'cunning-man' and 'wise-man' were the most frequent."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lmfuwq0mQMUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA130#v=onepage&amp;q=+interchangeable+terms+for+these+practitioners,+&amp;f=false|title=Witchcraft in Tudor and Stuart England: A Regional and Comparative Study|first=Alan|last=Macfarlane|date=31 October 1999|publisher=Psychology Press|accessdate=31 October 2017|via=Google Books|isbn=9780415196123}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contemporary [[Reginald Scot]] explained, "At this day it is indifferent to say in the English tongue, 'she is a witch' or 'she is a wise woman'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Scot |first=Reginald |authorlink=Reginald Scot |date=1584 |title=The Discoverie of Witchcraft |volume=Booke V |chapter=Chapter 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Folk magicians throughout Europe were often viewed ambivalently by communities, and were considered as capable of harming as of healing,&lt;ref&gt;Wilby, Emma (2006) ''Cunning Folk and Familiar Spirits''. pp. 51–4.&lt;/ref&gt; which could lead to their being accused as "witches" in the negative sense. Many English "witches" convicted of consorting with demons seem to have been cunning folk whose [[fairy]] [[familiar spirit|familiar]]s had been demonised;&lt;ref&gt;Emma Wilby 2005 p. 123; See also [https://books.google.com/books?id=lmfuwq0mQMUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA127#v=onepage&amp;q=white%20witches%20black%20witches&amp;f=false Alan Macfarlane p. 127 who notes how "white witches" could later be accused as "black witches".]&lt;/ref&gt; many French ''devins-guerisseurs'' ("diviner-healers") were accused of witchcraft,&lt;ref&gt;Monter () ''Witchcraft in France and Switzerland''. Ch. 7: "White versus Black Witchcraft".&lt;/ref&gt; and over one half the accused witches in Hungary seem to have been healers.&lt;ref&gt;Pócs 1999, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the healers and diviners historically accused of witchcraft have considered themselves mediators between the mundane and spiritual worlds, roughly equivalent to [[shamanism|shamans]].&lt;ref&gt;As defined by [[Mircea Eliade]] in ''Shamanism, Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy'', Bollingen Series LXXVI, Pantheon Books, NY NY 1964, pp. 3–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Such people described their contacts with fairies, spirits often involving out-of-body experiences and travelling through the realms of an "other-world".&lt;ref name="Ginzburg 1990 Part 2, Ch. 1"&gt;Ginzburg (1990) Part 2, Ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;
Beliefs of this nature are implied in the folklore of much of Europe, and were explicitly described by accused witches in central and southern Europe. Repeated themes include participation in processions of the dead or large feasts, often presided over by a horned male deity or a female divinity who teaches magic and gives prophecies; and participation in battles against evil spirits, "vampires", or "witches" to win fertility and prosperity for the community.

=== Accusations of witchcraft ===
[[Éva Pócs]] states that reasons for accusations of witchcraft fall into four general categories:&lt;ref name="Pocs" /&gt;
# A person was caught in the act of positive or negative [[Maleficium (sorcery)|sorcery]]
# A well-meaning sorcerer or healer lost their clients' or the authorities' trust
# A person did nothing more than gain the enmity of their neighbours
# A person was reputed to be a witch and surrounded with an aura of witch-beliefs or [[Occultism]]

She identifies three varieties of witch in popular belief:&lt;ref name="Pocs" /&gt;
* The "neighbourhood witch" or "social witch": a witch who curses a neighbour following some conflict.
* The "magical" or "sorcerer" witch: either a professional healer, sorcerer, seer or midwife, or a person who has through magic increased her fortune to the perceived detriment of a neighbouring household; due to neighbourly or community rivalries and the ambiguity between positive and negative magic, such individuals can become labelled as witches.
* The "supernatural" or "night" witch: portrayed in court narratives as a demon appearing in visions and dreams.&lt;ref&gt;Pócs 1999 pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;
"Neighbourhood witches" are the product of neighbourhood tensions, and are found only in self-sufficient serf village communities where the inhabitants largely rely on each other. Such accusations follow the breaking of some social norm, such as the failure to return a borrowed item, and any person part of the normal social exchange could potentially fall under suspicion. Claims of "sorcerer" witches and "supernatural" witches could arise out of social tensions, but not exclusively; the supernatural witch in particular often had nothing to do with communal conflict, but expressed tensions between the human and supernatural worlds; and in Eastern and Southeastern Europe such supernatural witches became an ideology explaining calamities that befell entire communities.&lt;ref&gt;Pócs 1999 pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Violence related to accusations====
Belief in witchcraft continues to be present today in some societies and accusations of witchcraft are the trigger of serious forms of violence, including murder. Such incidents are common in places such as [[Burkina Faso]], [[Ghana]], [[India]], [[Kenya]], [[Malawi]], [[Nepal]] and [[Tanzania]]. Accusations of witchcraft are sometimes linked to personal disputes, jealousy, and conflicts between neighbors or family over land or inheritance. Witchcraft-related violence is often discussed as a serious issue in the broader context of [[violence against women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genevadeclaration.org/fileadmin/docs/Co-publications/Femicide_A%20Gobal%20Issue%20that%20demands%20Action.pdf |title=A Global Issue that Demands Action |publisher=the Academic Council on the United Nations System (ACUNS) Vienna Liaison Office |date=2013 |accessdate=2014-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1129&amp;context=djcil#H2N1 |title=CONFLICT BETWEEN STATE LEGAL NORMS AND NORMS UNDERLYING POPULAR BELIEFS: WITCHCRAFT IN AFRICA AS A CASE STUDY |publisher=DUKE JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE &amp; INTERNATIONAL LAW, Vol 14:351 |date=2005 |accessdate=2014-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mrc.ac.za/crime/witchhunts.pdf |title=WITCH HUNTS IN MODERN SOUTH AFRICA: AN UNDER-REPRESENTED FACET OF GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE |publisher=MRC-UNISA Crime, Violence and Injury Lead Programm |date=June 2009 |accessdate=2014-06-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425074549/http://www.mrc.ac.za/crime/witchhunts.pdf |archive-date=2012-04-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanrights.asia/opinions/columns/AHRC-ETC-056-2011 |title=NEPAL: Witchcraft as a Superstition and a form of violence against women in Nepal — Asian Human Rights Commission |publisher=Humanrights.asia |accessdate=2014-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Mensah Adinkrah |url=http://vaw.sagepub.com/content/10/4/325.abstract |title=Witchcraft Accusations and Female Homicide Victimization in Contemporary Ghana |journal=Violence Against Women |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=325–356 |date=2004-04-01 |accessdate=2014-06-07|doi=10.1177/1077801204263419 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Tanzania, about 500 older women are murdered each year following accusations against them of witchcraft or of being a witch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/global_campaign/en/chap5.pdf |title=World Report on Violence and Health |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |accessdate=2014-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from extrajudicial violence, there is also state-sanctioned violence in some jurisdictions.

=== Contemporary witchcraft ===
{{Further information|Neoshamanism|Modern paganism}}
Modern practices identified by their practitioners as "witchcraft" have grown dramatically since the early 20th century. Generally portrayed as revivals of pre-Christian European [[ritual]] and [[spirituality]], they are understood to involve varying degrees of [[Magic (paranormal)#Varieties of magical practice|magic]], [[shamanism]], [[folk medicine]], [[spiritual healing]], calling on [[elemental]]s and [[spirit]]s, veneration of ancient [[Pantheon (religion)|deities]] and [[archetype]]s, and attunement with the forces of nature.

The first [[Neopagan]] groups to publicly appear, during the 1950s and 60s, were [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]]'s [[Bricket Wood coven]] and [[Robert Cochrane (witch)|Roy Bowers]]' [[Clan of Tubal Cain]]. They operated as [[initiation|initiatory]] [[secret society|secret societies]]. Other individual practitioners and writers such as [[Paul Huson]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Huson|Huson, Paul]] ''[[Mastering Witchcraft]]: a Practical Guide for Witches, Warlocks, and Covens'', New York: G.P. Putnams Sons, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; also claimed inheritance to surviving traditions of witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, Chas S., ''Her Hidden Children: The Rise of Wicca and Paganism in America'', Lanham, MD: Altamira, 2006, {{ISBN|0-7591-0202-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Wicca ====
{{Main article|Wicca}}
During the 20th century, interest in witchcraft in [[English language|English-speaking]] and European countries began to increase, inspired particularly by [[Margaret Murray]]'s theory of a [[Witch-cult hypothesis|pan-European witch-cult]] originally published in 1921, since discredited by further careful historical research.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Elliot, ''A Razor for a Goat'', [[University of Toronto Press]], 1962. Hutton, Ronald, ''The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles'', [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge, Mass.]]: [[Blackwell Publishers]], 1993. Hutton, Ronald, ''The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft'', [[Oxford University Press]], 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Interest was intensified, however, by [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner's]] claim in 1954 in ''[[Witchcraft Today]]'' that a form of witchcraft still existed in [[England]]. The truth of Gardner's claim is now disputed too, with different historians offering evidence for&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Heselton |first=Philip |authorlink=Philip Heselton |title=Wiccan Roots |isbn=978-1-86163-110-7|year=2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Heselton |first=Philip |authorlink=Philip Heselton |title=Gerald Gardner and the Cauldron of Inspiration |isbn=978-1-86163-164-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; or against&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Aidan, ''Crafting the Art of Magic'', [[Llewellyn Worldwide|Llewellyn Publications]], 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, Ronald, ''Triumph of the Moon'', Oxford University Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ruickbie |first=Leo |authorlink=Leo Ruickbie |title=Witchcraft Out of the Shadows |isbn=978-0-7090-7567-7|year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the religion's existence prior to Gardner.

The Wicca that Gardner initially taught was a witchcraft religion having a lot in common with Margaret Murray's hypothetically posited cult of the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Margaret A., ''The Witch-Cult in Western Europe'', Oxford University Press, 1921.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Murray wrote an introduction to Gardner's ''Witchcraft Today'', in effect putting her stamp of approval on it. Wicca is now practised as a religion of an [[Initiation|initiatory]] [[secret society]] nature with positive ethical principles, organised into autonomous [[coven]]s and led by a High Priesthood. There is also a large "Eclectic Wiccan" movement of individuals and groups who share key Wiccan beliefs but have no initiatory connection or affiliation with traditional Wicca. Wiccan writings and ritual show borrowings from a number of sources including 19th and 20th-century [[ceremonial magic]], the medieval grimoire known as the [[Key of Solomon]], [[Aleister Crowley]]'s [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] and pre-Christian religions.&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, R.,''The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft'', Oxford University Press, pp. 205–252, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, A.A., ''Crafting the Art of Magic, Book I: a History of Modern Witchcraft, 1939–1964'', Minnesota: [[Llewellyn Publications]], 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Valiente, D., ''The Rebirth of Witchcraft'', London: Robert Hale, pp. 35–62, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Both men and women are equally termed "witches." They practice a form of [[Duotheism|duotheistic]] [[universalism]].

Since Gardner's death in 1964, the Wicca that he claimed he was initiated into has attracted many initiates, becoming the largest of the various witchcraft traditions in the Western world, and has influenced other Neopagan and occult movements.

=====Witchcraft, feminism, and media=====
Wiccan literature has been described as aiding the empowerment of young women through its lively portrayal of female protagonists. Part of the recent growth in Neo-Pagan religions has been attributed to the strong media presence of fictional works such as the [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]] and [[Harry Potter]] series with their depictions of witchcraft.&lt;ref name=tosenberger&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tosenberger|first=Catherine|title=Neo-Paganism for teens|url=http://jeunessejournal.ca/index.php/yptc/article/view/81/63|journal=Jeunesse: Young People, Texts, Cultures|volume=2.2|year=2010|pages=172–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Widespread accessibility to related material through internet media such as chat rooms and forums is also thought to be driving this development. Wiccan beliefs are currently often found to be compatible with liberal ideals such as the [[Green movement]], and particularly with [[feminism]] by providing young women with means for empowerment and for control of their own lives.&lt;ref name=jarvis&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jarvis|first=Christine|title=Becoming a woman through Wicca: Witches and wiccans in contemporary teen fiction|journal=Children's Literature in Education|volume=39|issue=1|year=2008|pages= 43–52|doi=10.1007/s10583-007-9058-0|url=http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/id/eprint/4140/2/CLE_Jarvis_Wicca_article_2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=merskin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Merskin|first=Debra|title=Joining Forces: Teen Girl Witches and Internet Chat Groups|url=http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/1/7/1/3/0/p171306_index.html |journal=Proceedings of the International Communication Association|date=2007-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the case particularly in North America due to the strong presence of feminist ideals.&lt;ref name=tosenberger/&gt; The 2002 study [[Enchanted Feminism|Enchanted Feminism: The Reclaiming Witches of San Francisco]] suggests that Wiccan religion represents the second wave of feminism that has also been redefined as a religious movement.&lt;ref name=jarvis/&gt;

==== Stregheria ====
{{Main article|Stregheria}}
Stregheria is an [[Italy|Italian]] witchcraft religion popularised in the 1980s by [[Raven Grimassi]], who claims that it evolved within the ancient [[Etruscan mythology|Etruscan religion]] of Italian peasants who worked under the [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] upper classes.

Modern Stregheria closely resembles [[Charles Leland]]'s controversial late-19th-century account of a surviving Italian religion of witchcraft, worshipping the Goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], her brother [[Dianus]]/[[Lucifer]], and their daughter [[Aradia]]. Leland's witches do not see Lucifer as the evil [[Satan]] that Christians see, but a benevolent god of the Sun and Moon).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Encyclopedia of Modern Witchcraft and Neo-Paganism|first1=Shelley|last1=Rabinovitch|first2=James|last2=Lewis|year=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ritual format of contemporary Stregheria is roughly similar to that of other Neopagan witchcraft religions such as [[Wicca]]. The [[pentagram]] is the most common symbol of religious identity. Most followers celebrate a series of eight festivals equivalent to the Wiccan [[Wheel of the Year]], though others follow the ancient Roman festivals. An emphasis is placed on [[ancestor worship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stregheria.com/FAQ.html|website=Stregheria.com|title=Stregheria.com FAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Traditional witchcraft ====
{{Main article|Traditional witchcraft}}
Traditional witchcraft is a term used to refer to a variety of contemporary forms of witchcraft. Pagan studies scholar Ethan Doyle White described it as "a broad movement of aligned magico-religious groups who reject any relation to Gardnerianism and the wider Wiccan movement, claiming older, more "traditional" roots. Although typically united by a shared aesthetic rooted in European folklore, the Traditional Craft contains within its ranks a rich and varied array of occult groups, from those who follow a contemporary Pagan path that is suspiciously similar to Wicca to those who adhere to [[Luciferianism]]".{{sfn|Doyle White|2011|pp=205–206}} According to British Traditional Witch Michael Howard, the term refers to "any non-Gardnerian, non-Alexandrian, non-Wiccan or pre-modern form of the Craft, especially if it has been inspired by historical forms of witchcraft and folk magic".&lt;ref&gt;[[#How11|Howard 2011]]. p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Another definition was offered by Daniel A. Schulke, the current Magister of the Cultus Sabbati, when he proclaimed that ''traditional witchcraft'' "refers to a coterie of initiatory lineages of ritual magic, spellcraft and devotional mysticism".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch06|Schulke 2006]].&lt;/ref&gt; Some forms of traditional witchcraft are the [[Feri Tradition]], [[Cochrane's Craft]] and the Sabbatic craft.&lt;ref&gt;[[#How11|Howard 2011]]. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contemporary witchcraft, Satanism and Luciferianism ===
{{main article|Satanism|Satanism and Witchcraft}}
[[File:Baphomet.png|thumb|[[Eliphas Levi|Eliphas Lévi's]] Sabbatic goat (known as The Goat of Mendes or [[Baphomet]]) is one of Satanism's most common symbols.]]

[[Satanism]] is a broad term referring to diverse beliefs that share a symbolic association with, or admiration for, [[Satan]], who is seen as a liberating figure. While it is heir to the same historical period and pre-Enlightenment beliefs that gave rise to modern witchcraft, it is generally seen as completely separate from modern witchcraft and Wicca, and has little or no connection to them.

Modern witchcraft considers Satanism to be the "dark side of Christianity" rather than a branch of Wicca: – the character of Satan referenced in Satanism exists only in the theology of the three Abrahamic religions, and Satanism arose as, and occupies the role of, a rebellious counterpart to Christianity, in which all is permitted and the self is central. (Christianity can be characterized as having the diametrically opposite views to these.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smokyhole.org/wicca/satvnp.htm|title=Satanism vs. Neo-Pagan Witchcraft|work=holysmoke.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such beliefs become more visibly expressed in Europe after the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], when works such as [[John Milton|Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' were described anew by [[Romanticism|romantics]] who suggested that they presented the biblical Satan as an [[allegory]] representing crisis of faith, [[individualism]], [[free will]], [[wisdom]] and [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]]; a few works from that time also begin to directly present Satan in a less negative light, such as ''[[Letters from the Earth]]''. The two major trends are [[theistic Satanism]] and [[Satanism#Atheistic Satanism|atheistic Satanism]]; the former venerates Satan as a supernatural [[patriarchal]] [[deity]], while the latter views Satan as merely a symbolic embodiment of certain human traits.&lt;ref name="Point of Inquiry Interview"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gilmore|first=Peter|title=Science and Satanism|url=http://www.pointofinquiry.org/peter_h_gilmore_science_and_satanism/|work=Point of Inquiry Interview|accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organized groups began to emerge in the mid 20th century, including the [[Ophite Cultus Satanas]] (1948)&lt;ref name=JamesRLewis&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=James R.|title=The Encyclopedia of Cults, Sects, and New Religions|date=2002|publisher=Prometheus Books|isbn=978-1573922227|page=553|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lk8_ARNz-dYC&amp;pg=PA553&amp;lpg=PA553&amp;dq=Ophite+Cultus+Satanas+arthur+sloane#v=onepage&amp;q=Ophite%20Cultus%20Satanas%20arthur%20sloane&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Church of Satan]] (1966).  After seeing [[Margaret Murray]]'s book ''The God of the Witches'' the leader of Ophite Cultus Satanas, Herbert Arthur Sloane, said he realized that the horned god was Satan (''Sathanas''). Sloane also corresponded with his contemporary [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], founder of the Wicca religion, and implied that his views of Satan and the horned god were not necessarily in conflict with Gardner's approach. However, he did believe that, while "gnosis" referred to knowledge, and "[[Wicca]]" referred to wisdom, modern witches had fallen away from the true knowledge, and instead had begun worshipping a [[fertility god]], a reflection of the creator god. He wrote that "the largest existing body of witches who are true Satanists would be the [[Yezedees]]". Sloane highly recommended the book ''The Gnostic Religion'', and sections of it were sometimes read at ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;''Black Magic, Satanism, Voodoo'', by Dr. Leo L. Martello, 1972 (Interview with Sloane on pp. 31–34, ''Our Lord Sathanas'')&lt;/ref&gt; It was estimated that there were up to 100,000 Satanists worldwide by 2006, twice the number estimated in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/satanism.htm|accessdate=March 24, 2013|date=March 2006|title=Religious Satanism, 16th century Satanism, Satanic Dabbling, etc|publisher=Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance|author=B.A. Robinson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Satanistic beliefs have been largely permitted as a valid expression of religious belief in the West.

== Historical and religious perspectives ==
===Near East beliefs===
The belief in sorcery and its practice seem to have been widespread in the [[Ancient Near East]] and [[Nile Valley]]. It played a conspicuous role in the cultures of [[ancient Egypt]] and in [[Babylonia]]. The latter tradition included an [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]] anti-witchcraft ritual, the [[Maqlû]]. A section from the [[Code of Hammurabi]] (about 2000 B.C.) prescribes:

{{quote|If a man has put a spell upon another man and it is not justified, he upon whom the spell is laid shall go to the holy river; into the holy river shall he plunge. If the holy river overcome him and he is drowned, the man who put the spell upon him shall take possession of his house. If the holy river declares him innocent and he remains unharmed the man who laid the spell shall be put to death. He that plunged into the river shall take possession of the house of him who laid the spell upon him.&lt;ref&gt;''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia'' [http://www.bible-history.com/isbe/W/WITCH%3B+WITCHCRAFT/ article on Witchcraft], last accessed 31 March 2006. There is some discrepancy between translations; compare with that given in the ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15674a.htm article on Witchcraft] (accessed 31 March 2006), and the [http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/medieval/hamframe.htm L.

===Abrahamic religions===
==== Hebrew Bible ====
{{Main article|Witchcraft and divination in the Hebrew Bible}}
According to the New Advent Catholic Encyclopedia: {{quote|In the Holy Scripture references to sorcery are frequent, and the strong condemnations of such practices found there do not seem to be based so much upon the supposition of [[fraud]] as upon the abomination of the magic in itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15674a.htm |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Witchcraft |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1912-10-01 |accessdate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:Wickiana3.jpg|thumb|left|Execution of alleged witches in Central Europe, 1587]]
The [[King James Version]] uses the words "witch", "witchcraft", and "witchcrafts" to translate the [[Masoretic Text|Masoretic]] {{hebrew|כָּשַׁף}} ''kāsháf'' ({{IPA-he|kɔˈʃaf}}) and {{hebrew|קֶסֶם}} (''qésem'');&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Nahum|3:4|}}; {{bibleverse|1|Samuel|15:23|}}; {{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|33:6|}}; {{bibleverse|2|Kings|9:22|}}; {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|18:10|}}; {{bibleverse||Exodus|22:18|}}&lt;/ref&gt; these same English terms are used to translate {{lang|grc|φαρμακεία}} ''pharmakeia'' in the [[Greek New Testament]]. Verses such as {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|18:11–12|}} and {{bibleverse||Exodus|22:18|}} ("Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live") thus provided scriptural justification for Christian [[witch-hunt|witch hunters]] in the [[early modern period]] (see [[Christian views on magic]]).

The precise meaning of the Hebrew {{hebrew|כָּשַׁף}}, usually translated as "witch" or "sorceress", is uncertain. In the [[Septuagint]], it was translated as ''pharmakeía'' or ''pharmakous''. In the 16th century, [[Reginald Scot]], a prominent critic of the witch trials, translated {{Hebrew|כָּשַׁף}}, φαρμακεία, and the [[Vulgate]]'s [[Latin]] equivalent ''veneficos'' as all meaning "poisoner", and on this basis, claimed that "witch" was an incorrect translation and poisoners were intended.&lt;ref&gt;Scot, Reginald (c. 1580) ''The Discoverie of Witchcraft'' Booke VI Ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; His theory still holds some currency, but is not widely accepted, and in {{bibleverse||Daniel|2:2|}} {{hebrew|כָּשַׁף}} is listed alongside other magic practitioners who could interpret dreams: magicians, astrologers, and Chaldeans. Suggested derivations of {{hebrew|כָּשַׁף}} include "mutterer" (from a single root) or ''herb user'' (as a compound word formed from the roots ''kash'', meaning "herb", and ''hapaleh'', meaning "using"). The Greek φαρμακεία literally means "herbalist" or one who uses or administers drugs, but it was used virtually synonymously with ''[[Magic (paranormal)|mageia]]'' and ''[[Goetia|goeteia]]'' as a term for a sorcerer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dickie |first=Matthew |title=Magic and Magicians in the Greco-Roman World |pages=33–35 |date=2003 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-24982-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bible provides some evidence that these commandments against sorcery were enforced under the Hebrew kings:
{{quote|And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, I [[prithee|pray thee]], divine unto me by the familiar spirit, and bring me him up, whom I shall name unto thee. And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die?&lt;ref&gt;I Samuel 28.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Note that the Hebrew word {{hebrew|אֹב}} ''ob'', translated as ''familiar spirit'' in the above quotation, has a different meaning than the usual English sense of the phrase; namely, it refers to a spirit that the woman is familiar with, rather than to [[familiar spirit|a spirit that physically manifests itself in the shape of an animal]].

==== New Testament ====
{{See also|Christian views on magic}}
The [[New Testament]] condemns the practice as an abomination, just as the Old Testament had ([[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] 5:20, compared with [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 21:8; 22:15; and [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 8:9; 13:6). The word in most New Testament translations is "sorcerer"/"sorcery" rather than "witch"/"witchcraft".

==== Judaism ====
{{See also|Witchcraft and divination in the Hebrew Bible}}
[[Halakha|Jewish law]] views the practice of witchcraft as being laden with [[idolatry]] and/or [[necromancy]]; both being serious theological and practical offenses in [[Judaism]]. Although [[Maimonides]] vigorously denied the efficacy of all methods of witchcraft, and claimed that the Biblical prohibitions regarding it were precisely to wean the Israelites from practices related to [[idolatry]]. It is acknowledged that while magic exists, it is forbidden to practice it on the basis that it usually involves the worship of other gods. [[Rabbi]]s of the Talmud also condemned magic when it produced something other than illusion, giving the example of two men who use magic to pick cucumbers (Sanhedrin 67a). The one who creates the illusion of picking cucumbers should not be condemned, only the one who actually picks the cucumbers through magic.

However, some of the rabbis practiced "magic" themselves or taught the subject. For instance, [[Rabbah]] created a person and sent him to [[Rav Zeira]], and [[Hanina]] and [[Hoshaiah]] studied every Friday together and created a small calf to eat on [[Shabbat]] (Sanhedrin 67b). In these cases, the "magic" was seen more as divine miracles (i.e., coming from [[God]] rather than "unclean" forces) than as witchcraft.

Judaism does make it clear that Jews shall not try to learn about the ways of witches ([[Book of Deuteronomy]] 18: 9–10) and that witches are to be put to death ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 22:17).

Judaism's most famous reference to a medium is undoubtedly the [[Witch of Endor]] whom [[Saul]] consults, as recounted in [[Books of Samuel|1 Samuel]] 28.

==== Islam ====
Divination, and [[Magic (paranormal)#In Islam|magic]] in Islam, encompass a wide range of practices, including [[black magic]], warding off the [[evil eye]], the production of [[amulet]]s and other magical equipment, [[evocation]], [[cleromancy|casting lots]], and [[astrology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-lZ3QgAACAAJ|title=Magic and Divination in Early Islam|last=Savage-Smith|first=Emilie|date=2004|publisher=Ashgate/Variorum|isbn=9780860787150|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims do commonly believe in magic (''sihr'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1573-3912_islam_DUM_2460 “Magic”, in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', Edited by: P.

{{quote|Say: I seek refuge with the Lord of the Dawn From the mischief of created things; From the mischief of Darkness as it overspreads; From the mischief of those who practise secret arts; And from the mischief of the envious one as he practises envy. (Qur'an 113:1–5)}}

Also according to the Qur'an:&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Qur'an: An Encyclopedia|last=Leaman|first=Oliver|publisher=Routledge|others=Leaman, Oliver, 1950-, Credo Reference|year=2011|isbn=9781780343686|location=Abingdon, Oxon [England]|pages=381|oclc=764567609}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|And they follow that which the devils falsely related against the kingdom of Solomon. Solomon disbelieved not; but the devils disbelieved, teaching mankind sorcery and that which was revealed to the two angels in Babel, Harut and Marut&amp;nbsp;... And surely they do know that he who trafficketh therein will have no (happy) portion in the Hereafter; and surely evil is the price for which they sell their souls, if they but knew. (Qur'an 2:102)
}}

Islam distinguishes between God-given gifts, which can heal sickness, and [[Demonic possession#Islam|possession]], and sorcery. Good supernatural powers are therefore a ''special gift from [[God in Islam|God]]'', whereas sorcery or black magic is achieved through help of [[jinn]] and [[Shaitan|demons]]. In the Qurʾānic narrative, the [[Solomon in Islam|Prophet Sulayman]] had the power to speak with animals and command jinn, and he thanks God for this نعمة (i.e. gift, privilege, favour, bounty), which is only given to him with God’s permission.{{Cite Quran|27|19}}&lt;ref&gt;''Tafsir Ibn Kathir'' for surah 21, verse 19&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Muhammad|Prophet Muhammad]] was accused of being a magician by his opponents.{{Cite Quran|10|2}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e1374|title=Magic - Oxford Islamic Studies Online|website=www.oxfordislamicstudies.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of seeking help from the jinn is prohibited and can lead to possession. The ''ruqya'' contains verses of the Qur'an as well as prayers specifically targeted against demons. The knowledge of which verses of the Qur'an to use in what way is what is considered "magic knowledge."{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

A ''[[hadith]]'' recorded in {{hadith-usc|bukhari|8|76|479}} states: "Seventy thousand people of my followers will enter Paradise without accounts, and they are those who do not practice Ar-Ruqya and do not see an evil omen in things, and put their trust in their Lord." [[Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya]], a [[Islamic scholar|scholar]], commented on this ''hadith'', stating: That is because these people will enter Paradise without being called to account because of the perfection of their Tawheed, therefore he described them as people who did not ask others to perform ruqyah for them. Hence he said "and they put their trust in their Lord." Because of their complete trust in their Lord, their contentment with Him, their faith in Him, their being pleased with Him and their seeking their needs from Him, they do not ask people for anything, be it ruqyah or anything else, and they are not influenced by omens and superstitions that could prevent them from doing what they want to do, because superstition detracts from and weakens Tawheed".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Zad al-Ma'ad|last=al-Jawziyya|first=Ibn Qayyim|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=1/475|trans-title=Provisions of the Hereafter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Southern African traditions, there are three classifications of somebody who uses magic. The ''[[tagati]]'' is usually improperly translated into English as "witch", and is a spiteful person who operates in secret to harm others. The ''[[sangoma]]'' is a diviner, somewhere on a par with a [[fortune teller]], and is employed in detecting illness, predicting a person's future (or advising them on which path to take), or identifying the guilty party in a crime. She also practices some degree of medicine. The ''inyanga'' is often translated as "witch doctor" (though many Southern Africans resent this implication, as it perpetuates the mistaken belief that a "witch doctor" is in some sense a ''practitioner'' of malicious magic). The ''inyanga''{{'}}s job is to heal illness and injury and provide customers with magical items for everyday use. Of these three categories the ''tagati'' is almost exclusively female, the ''sangoma'' is usually female, and the ''inyanga'' is almost exclusively male.

Much of what witchcraft represents in Africa has been susceptible to misunderstandings and confusion, thanks in no small part to a tendency among western scholars since the time of the now largely discredited [[Margaret Murray]] to approach the subject through a comparative lens vis-a-vis European witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Okeja|first=Uchenna|title="An African Context of the Belief in Witchcraft and Magic," in Rational Magic|date=2011|publisher=Fisher Imprints|isbn=978-1-84888-061-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Okeja argues that witchcraft in Africa today plays a very different social role than in Europe of the past—or present—and should be understood through an African rather than post-colonial Western lens.

They could also gather the power of animals into their hands ... whenever they needed. ... If we could make use of these kinds of witchcraft, our country would rapidly progress in knowledge of every kind."&lt;ref&gt;Janzen &amp; MacGaffey 1974, pp. 54b-55a (13.9.16).&lt;/ref&gt; "You witches (''zindoki'') too, bring your science into the light to be written down so that ... the benefits in it ... endow our race."&lt;ref&gt;Janzen &amp; MacGaffey 1974, p. 55b (13.10.8).&lt;/ref&gt;

In some [[Central Africa]]n areas, malicious magic users are believed by locals to be the source of [[terminal illness]] such as [[AIDS]] and [[cancer]]. In such cases, various methods are used to rid the person from the bewitching spirit, occasionally [[physical abuse|physical]] and [[psychological abuse]]. Children may be accused of being witches, for example a young niece may be blamed for the illness of a relative. Most of these cases of abuse go unreported since the members of the society that witness such abuse are too afraid of being accused of being accomplices. It is also believed that witchcraft can be transmitted to children by feeding. Parents discourage their children from interacting with people believed to be witches.{{dubious|date=August 2018}}{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Every year, hundreds of people in the [[Central African Republic]] are convicted of witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.reuters.com/africanews/2010/02/04/the-dangers-of-witchcraft/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100312100813/http://blogs.reuters.com/africanews/2010/02/04/the-dangers-of-witchcraft/ |archivedate=2010-03-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anti-balaka|Christian militias]] in the Central African Republic have also kidnapped, burnt and buried alive women accused of being 'witches' in public ceremonies.&lt;ref name="Esslemont 2015"&gt;{{Cite news | last=Esslemont | first=Tom | title=Witch burning rebels stoke Central African Republic violence | newspaper=Reuters | date=26 November 2015 | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-centralafrica-witchcraft/witch-burning-rebels-stoke-central-african-republic-violence-idUSKBN0TF03920151126 | access-date=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Democratic Republic of the Congo ====
{{As of|2006}}, between 25,000 and 50,000 children in [[Kinshasa]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], had been accused of witchcraft and thrown out of their homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Richard Dowden in Kinshasa |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/feb/12/theobserver.worldnews11 |title=Thousands of child 'witches' turned on to the streets to starve &amp;#124; World news |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; These children have been subjected to often-violent abuse during [[exorcism]]s, sometimes supervised by self-styled religious pastors. Other pastors and Christian activists strongly oppose such accusations and try to rescue children from their unscrupulous colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2009/september/27.62.html|title=Kolwezi: Accused of witchcraft by parents and churches, children in the Democratic Republic of Congo are being rescued by Christian activists|website=Christianity Today|date=September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The usual term for these children is ''enfants sorciers'' (child witches) or ''enfants dits sorciers'' (children accused of witchcraft). In 2002, [[USAID]] funded the production of two short films on the subject, made in Kinshasa by journalists Angela Nicoara and Mike Ormsby.

In April 2008, in Kinshasa, the police arrested 14 suspected victims (of [[penis snatching]]) and [[Magician (paranormal)|sorcerers]] accused of using black magic or witchcraft to steal (make disappear) or shrink men's penises to extort cash for cure, amid a wave of panic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Bavier |first=Joe |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idUSN2319603620080423?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=oddlyEnoughNews&amp;rpc=22&amp;sp=true |title=Penis theft panic hits city.. |newspaper=Reuters |date=2008-04-23 |accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one study, the belief in magical warfare technologies (such as "bulletproofing") in the Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo serves a group-level function, as it increases group efficiency in warfare, even if it is suboptimal at the individual level.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Nunn |first=Nathan |authorlink=Nathan Nunn |last2=Sierra |first2=Raul Sanchez de la |date=2017 |title=Why Being Wrong can be Right: Magical Warfare Technologies and the Persistence of False Beliefs |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=107 |issue=5 |pages=582–87 |doi=10.1257/aer.p20171091 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of the study argue that this is one reason why the belief in witchcraft persists.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Ghana ====
In [[Ghana]], women are often accused of witchcraft and attacked by neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://graphic.com.gh/dailygraphic/page.php?news=10405 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110108050152/http://graphic.com.gh/dailygraphic/page.php?news=10405 |archivedate=2011-01-08 |title=My Mum is Not A Witch |accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, there exist six [[witch camp]]s in the country where women suspected of being witches can flee for safety.&lt;ref name="Camps"&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19437130 | title=Ghana witch camps: Widows' lives in exile | publisher=BBC | accessdate=September 1, 2012| work=BBC News | date=September 2012 | last1=Whitaker | first1=Kati }}&lt;/ref&gt; The witch camps, which exist solely in Ghana, are thought to house a total of around 1000 women.&lt;ref name="Camps"/&gt; Some of the camps are thought to have been set up over 100 years ago.&lt;ref name="Camps"/&gt; The Ghanaian government has announced that it intends to close the camps.&lt;ref name="Camps"/&gt;

Arrests were made in an effort to avoid bloodshed seen in [[Ghana]] a decade ago, when 12 alleged penis snatchers were beaten to death by mobs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/9701/18/briefs/ghana.penis.html ''7 killed in Ghana over 'penis-snatching' episodes''], CNN, January 18, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; While it is easy for modern people to dismiss such reports, Uchenna Okeja argues that a belief system in which such magical practices are deemed possible offer many benefits to Africans who hold them. For example, the belief that a sorcerer has "stolen" a man's penis functions as an anxiety-reduction mechanism for men suffering from impotence while simultaneously providing an explanation that is consistent with African cultural beliefs rather than appealing to Western scientific notions that are tainted by the history of colonialism (at least for many Africans).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Okeja |first=Uchenna |title="An African Context of the Belief in Witchcraft and Magic," in Rational Magic|date=2011|publisher=Fisher Imprints|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1-84888-061-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported on May 21, 2008 that in [[Kenya]], a mob had burnt to death at least 11 people accused of witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Reuters Editorial |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSL21301127 |title=Mob burns to death 11 Kenyan "witches" |newspaper=Reuters |date=2008-05-21 |accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Malawi ====
In [[Malawi]] it is also common practice to accuse children of witchcraft and many children have been abandoned, abused and even killed as a result. As in other African countries both African traditional healers and their Christian counterparts are trying to make a living out of exorcising children and are actively involved in pointing out children as witches.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, Carrie 2011.

According to [[William Kamkwamba]], witches and wizards are afraid of money, which they consider a rival evil. Any contact with [[cash]] will snap their spell and leave the wizard naked and confused. So placing cash, such as [[Malawian kwacha|kwacha]] around a room or bed mat will protect the resident from their malevolent spells.&lt;ref&gt;Kamkwamba, William. The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind. Harper Collins. 2009. Page 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Nigeria ====
In [[Nigeria]], several Pentecostal pastors have mixed their evangelical brand of Christianity with African beliefs in witchcraft to benefit from the lucrative witch finding and exorcism business—which in the past was the exclusive domain of the so-called witch doctor or traditional healers. These pastors have been involved in the torturing and even killing of children accused of witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humantrafficking.org/publications/593|title=Stepping Stones Nigeria 2007. Supporting Victims of Witchcraft Abuse and Street Children in Nigeria|website=humantrafficking.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017185346/http://humantrafficking.org/publications/593|archivedate=2012-10-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the past decade, around 15,000 children have been accused, and around 1,000 murdered. Churches are very numerous in Nigeria, and competition for congregations is hard. Some pastors attempt to establish a reputation for spiritual power by "detecting" child witches, usually following a death or loss of a job within a family, or an accusation of financial fraud against the pastor. In the course of "exorcisms", accused children may be starved, beaten, mutilated, set on fire, forced to consume acid or cement, or buried alive. While some church leaders and Christian activists have spoken out strongly against these abuses, many Nigerian churches are involved in the abuse, although church administrations deny knowledge of it.&lt;ref&gt;Houreld, Katharine (2009) [http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/world/church-burns-witchcraft-children/story-e6frev00-1225788721635 Church burns 'witchcraft' children]. Associated Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sierra Leone ====
Among the Mende (of [[Sierra Leone]]), trial and conviction for witchcraft has a beneficial effect for those convicted. "The witchfinder had warned the whole village to ensure the relative prosperity of the accused and sentenced ... old people. ... Six months later all of the people ... accused, were secure, well-fed and arguably happier than at any [previous] time; they had hardly to beckon and people would come with food or whatever was needful. ... Instead of such old and widowed people being left helpless or (as in Western society) institutionalized in old people's homes, these were reintegrated into society and left secure in their old age ... . ... Old people are 'suitable' candidates for this kind of accusation in the sense that they are isolated and vulnerable, and they are 'suitable' candidates for 'social security' for precisely the same reasons."&lt;ref&gt;Gittins 1987, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Kuranko language]], the term for witchcraft is ''suwa'ye''&lt;ref&gt;West, Harry G. "''Ethnographic Sorcery''" (p.24); 2007. The University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|978-0-226-89398-3}} (pbk.), {{ISBN|0-226-89398-7}} (pbk.)&lt;/ref&gt; referring to "extraordinary powers".

==== Tanzania ====
In [[Tanzania]] in 2008, President [[Jakaya Kikwete|Kikwete]] publicly condemned [[witchdoctor]]s for killing [[Albinism|albinos]] for their body parts, which are thought to bring good luck. 25 albinos have been murdered since March 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7518049.stm Living in fear: Tanzania's albinos], BBC News.&lt;/ref&gt; In Tanzania, albinos are often murdered for their body parts on the advice of witch doctors in order to produce powerful amulets that are believed to protect against witchcraft and make the owner prosper in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malleusmaleficarum.org/blogs/?p=348|title=Wicasta 2011.

=== Americas ===
==== Caribbean ====

Brua is an Afro-Caribbean religion and healing tradition that originates in Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao, in the Dutch Caribbean. A healer in this culture is called a ''kurioso'' or ''kuradó'', a man or woman who performs ''trabou chikí'' (little works) and ''trabou grandi'' (large treatments) to promote or restore health, bring fortune or misfortune, deal with unrequited love, and more serious concerns, in which sorcery is involved. Sorcery usually involves reference to the ''almasola'' or ''homber chiki'', a devil-like entity. ''Transcultural Psychiatry'' published a paper called "Traditional healing practices originating in Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao: A review of the literature on psychiatry and Brua" by Jan Dirk Blom, Igmar T. Poulina, Trevor L. van Gellecum and Hans W. Hoek of the Parnassia Psychiatric Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278016204|title=Traditional healing practices originating in Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao: A review of the literature on psychiatry and Brua|first1=Jan Dirk|last1=Blom|first2=Igmar|last2=T.

==== Colonial North America ====
[[File:Matteson Examination of a Witch.jpg|thumb|''Examination of a Witch'' by [[T. H. Matteson]], inspired by the [[Salem witch trials]]]]
In 1645, [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], experienced America's first accusations of witchcraft when husband and wife Hugh and Mary Parsons accused each other of witchcraft. At America's first [[witch trial]], Hugh was found innocent, while Mary was acquitted of witchcraft but sentenced to be hanged for the death of her child. She died in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.masslive.com/history/index.ssf/2011/05/springfields_375th_from_puritans_to_presidents.html |title=Springfield's 375th: From Puritans to presidents |publisher=Masslive.com |accessdate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1645–1663, about eighty people throughout England's [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts Bay Colony]] were accused of practicing witchcraft. Thirteen women and two men were executed in a witch-hunt that lasted throughout [[New England]] from 1645–1663.&lt;ref name=Fraden&gt;Fraden, Judith Bloom, Dennis Brindell Fraden. ''The Salem Witch Trials''. Marshall Cavendish. 2008. p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Salem witch trials]] followed in 1692–93. These witch trials were the most famous in [[British North America]] and took place in the coastal settlements near [[Salem, Massachusetts]]. Prior to the witch trials, nearly 300 men and women had been suspected of partaking in witchcraft, and 19 of these people were hanged, and one was “pressed to death”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=America: A Narrative History|year=2013|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.|isbn=978-0-393-91265-4|page=85|author=George Brown Tindall|edition=Brief Ninth Edition, Volume One|author2=David Emory Shi |editor=Jon Durbin. Retrieved 10/3/2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Salem witch trials were a series of hearings before local magistrates followed by county court trials to prosecute people accused of witchcraft in [[Essex County, Massachusetts|Essex]], [[Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Suffolk]] and [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Middlesex]] Counties of colonial Massachusetts, between February 1692 and May 1693. Over 150 people were arrested and imprisoned, with even more accused who were not formally pursued by the authorities. The two courts convicted 29 people of the capital felony of witchcraft. Nineteen of the accused, 14 women and 5 men, were hanged. [[Giles Corey|One man]] who refused to enter a plea was crushed to death under heavy stones in an attempt to force him to do so. At least five more of the accused died in prison.

Despite being generally known as the "Salem" witch trials, the preliminary hearings in 1692 were conducted in a variety of towns across the province: Salem Village (now [[Danvers, Massachusetts|Danvers]]), [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem Town]], [[Ipswich, Massachusetts|Ipswich]], and [[Andover, Massachusetts|Andover]]. The best known trials were conducted by the Court of [[Oyer and Terminer]] in 1692 in Salem Town.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.salemwitchmuseum.com/education|title=Salem Witch Museum|website=www.salemwitchmuseum.com|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; All 26 who went to trial before this court were convicted. The four sessions of the Superior Court of Judicature in 1693, held in Salem Town, but also in Ipswich, Boston, and Charlestown, produced only 3 convictions in the 31 witchcraft trials it conducted. Likewise, alleged witchcraft was not isolated to New England. In 1706 [[Grace Sherwood]] the "Witch of Pungo" was imprisoned for the crime in [[Princess Anne County, Virginia]].

In Maryland, there is a legend of Moll Dyer, who escaped a fire set by fellow colonists only to die of exposure in December&amp;nbsp;1697. The historical record of Dyer is scant as all official records were burned in a courthouse fire, though the county courthouse has on display the rock where her frozen body was found. A letter from a colonist of the period describes her in most unfavourable terms. A local road is named after Dyer, where her homestead was said to have been. Many local families have their own version of the Moll Dyer affair, and her name is spoken with care in the rural southern counties.&lt;ref&gt;David W. Thompson, "Sister Witch: The Life of Moll Dyer" (2017 Solstice Publishing) {{ISBN|978-1973105756}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accusations of witchcraft and wizardry led to the prosecution of a man in Tennessee as recently as 1833.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topix.com/forum/city/jamestown-tn/TPAPB6U4LVF0JDQC8/p2|title=Old Stories|work=Topix}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b1wvAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA67|title=History of Fentress County, Tennessee|last1=Hogue|first1=Albert Ross|year=1916}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Touring the East Tennessee Backroads |first=Carolyn |last=Sakowski|page=212 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rLBrUbj02IcC&amp;pg=PA212|isbn=9780895874764 |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Crucible]]'' by Arthur Miller is a dramatized and partially fictionalized story of the [[Salem witch trials]] that took place in the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] during 1692–93.

==== Diné / Navajo ====
In [[Navajo people|Diné culture]], witches are seen as the polar opposite of [[medicine man|ceremonial people]]. While spiritual leaders perform "[[Navajo song ceremonial complex|sings]]" for healing, protection and other beneficial purposes, all practices referred to as "witchcraft" are intended to hurt and curse. Witches are associated with harm to the community and transgression of societal standards, especially those relating to family and the dead.

The ''yee naaldlooshii'' is the type of witch known in English as a "[[skin-walker]]". They are believed to take the forms of animals in order to travel in secret and do harm to the innocent.&lt;ref name=Dictionary&gt;Wall, Leon and William Morgan, ''Navajo-English Dictionary''. Hippocrene Books, New York City, 1998 {{ISBN|0-7818-0247-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Navajo language]], ''{{lang|nv|yee naaldlooshii}}'' translates to "with it, he goes on all fours".&lt;ref name=Dictionary/&gt;  While perhaps the most common variety seen in horror fiction by non-Navajo people, the ''{{lang|nv|yee naaldlooshii}}'' is one of several varieties of Navajo witch, specifically a type of  ''{{lang|nv|’ánti’įhnii}}''.&lt;ref name=Dictionary/&gt;

Corpse powder or corpse poison ({{lang-nv|{{spell-nv|áńt’į́}}}}, literally "witchery" or "harming") is a substance made from powdered corpses.  The powder is used by witches to curse their victims.&lt;ref name="PerroneStockel1993"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Perrone|first1=Bobette|last2=Stockel|first2=H. Henrietta|last3=Krueger|first3=Victoria|title=Medicine women, curanderas, and women doctors|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ApJayEh43ZcC&amp;pg=PA189|accessdate=8 October 2010|date=1993|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0-8061-2512-1|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of the ''{{spell-nv|áńt’į́}}'' is a curse and disease, usually indicated by an immediate action to administration of the poison, like fainting, swelling of the tongue, or [[Trismus|lockjaw]]. Sometimes, however, the victims simply [[wasting|wastes away]], as from a normal disease.

Traditional Navajos usually hesitate to discuss things like witches and witchcraft with non-Navajos.&lt;ref name=Keene&gt;Keene, Dr. Adrienne, "[http://nativeappropriations.com/2016/03/magic-in-north-america-part-1-ugh.html Magic in North America Part 1: Ugh.]" at ''[[Native Appropriations]]'', 8 March 2016. Accessed 9 April 2016: "What happens when Rowling pulls this in, is we as Native people are now opened up to a barrage of questions about these beliefs and traditions ... but these are not things that need or should be discussed by outsiders. At all. I’m sorry if that seems "unfair," but that's how our cultures survive."&lt;/ref&gt;

==== North America (Mexico) ====
{{See also|Brujería}}
Witchcraft was also an important part of the social and cultural history of late-Colonial Mexico, during the [[Mexican Inquisition]]. Spanish Inquisitors viewed witchcraft as a problem that could be cured simply through confession. Yet, as anthropologist [[Ruth Behar]] writes, witchcraft, not only in Mexico but in Latin America in general, was a "conjecture of sexuality, witchcraft, and religion, in which Spanish, indigenous, and African cultures converged."&lt;ref&gt;Behar, Ruth. ''Sex and Sin, Witchcraft and the Devil in Late-Colonial Mexico.'' American Ethnologist, 14:1 (February 1987), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, witchcraft in Mexico generally required an interethnic and interclass network of witches.&lt;ref&gt;Lavrin, Asunción. ''Sexuality &amp; Marriage in Colonial Latin America.'' Reprint ed. Lincoln, NB.:University of Nebraska Press, 1992, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, according to anthropology professor Laura Lewis, witchcraft in colonial Mexico ultimately represented an "affirmation of hegemony" for women, Indians, and especially Indian women over their white male counterparts as a result of the [[casta]] system.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Laura A. ''Hall of mirrors: power, witchcraft, and caste in colonial Mexico.'' Durham, N.C.:Duke University Press, 2003, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern history, notoriety has been awarded to a place called [[Catemaco#The "witches" of Catemaco|Catemaco]], in the state of Veracruz, which has a history of witchcraft, and where the practice of witchcraft by contemporary ''brujos'' and ''brujas'' thrives.

In Mexico City, people who practice brujería, [[Santería]], voodoo, ocultism and magic may find items, herbs and supplies at the ''[[mercado de Sonora]]''.

==== South America ====
In [[Chile]] there is a tradition of the [[Kalku]] in [[Mapuche religion]]; and the [[Warlock of Chiloé|Warlocks of Chiloé]] in the folklore and [[Chilote mythology]].

The presence of the witch is a constant in the [[ethnographic]] [[history]] of [[colonial Brazil]], especially during the several denunciations and confessions given to the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] of [[Bahia]] (1591–1593), [[Pernambuco]] and [[Paraíba]] (1593–1595).&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} João Ribeiro Júnior, ''O Que é Magia'', p.48-49, Ed.

==== Nepal ====
Apart from other types of [[Violence against women]] in [[Nepal]], the malpractice of abusing women in the name of witchcraft is also really prominent. According to the statistics in 2013, there was a total of 69 reported cases of abuse to women due to accusation of performing witchcraft.

==== Japan ====
[[File:Okabe - The cat witch.jpg|thumb|Okabe – The cat witch, by [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]]]]

In Japanese folklore, the most common types of witch can be separated into two categories: those who employ [[snake]]s as familiars, and those who employ foxes.&lt;ref&gt;Blacker, Carmen. The Catalpa Bow : A Study of Shamanistic Practices in Japan. New York: Routledge Curzon, 1999. 51–59.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fox witch is, by far, the most commonly seen witch figure in Japan. Differing regional beliefs set those who use foxes into two separate types: the ''kitsune-mochi'', and the ''tsukimono-suji''. The first of these, the ''kitsune-mochi'', is a solitary figure who gains his fox familiar by bribing it with its favourite foods. The ''kitsune-mochi'' then strikes up a deal with the fox, typically promising food and daily care in return for the fox's magical services. The fox of Japanese folklore is a powerful trickster in and of itself, imbued with powers of shape changing, possession, and illusion. These creatures can be either nefarious; disguising themselves as women in order to trap men, or they can be benign forces as in the story of "The Grateful foxes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academia.issendai.com/foxtales/japan-grateful-foxes.shtml |title=The Grateful Foxes – Japanese foxtales |publisher=Academia.issendai.com |accessdate=2013-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, once a fox enters the employ of a human it almost exclusively becomes a force of evil to be feared. A fox under the employ of a human can provide many services. The fox can turn invisible and find secrets its master desires. It can apply its many powers of illusion to trick and deceive its master's enemies. The most feared power of the ''kitsune-mochi'' is the ability to command his fox to possess other humans. This process of possession is called [[Kitsunetsuki]].

By far, the most commonly reported cases of fox witchcraft in modern Japan are enacted by ''tsukimono-suji'' families, or "hereditary witches".&lt;ref&gt;Blacker, Carmen ''Catalpa Bow'' p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Tsukimono-suji'' is traditionally a family who is reported to have foxes under their employ. These foxes serve the family and are passed down through the generations, typically through the female line. ''Tsukimono-suji'' foxes are able to supply much in the way of the same mystical aid that the foxes under the employ of a ''kitsune-mochi'' can provide its more solitary master with. In addition to these powers, if the foxes are kept happy and well taken care of, they bring great fortune and prosperity to the ''Tsukimono-suji'' house. However, the aid in which these foxes give is often overshadowed by the social and mystical implications of being a member of such a family. In many villages, the status of local families as ''tsukimono-suji'' is often common, everyday knowledge. Such families are respected and feared, but are also openly shunned. Due to its hereditary nature, the status of being ''Tsukimono-suji'' is considered contagious. Because of this, it is often impossible for members of such a family to sell land or other properties, due to fear that the possession of such items will cause foxes to inundate one's own home. In addition to this, because the foxes are believed to be passed down through the female line, it is often nearly impossible for women of such families to find a husband whose family will agree to have him married to a ''tsukimono-suji'' family. In such a union the woman's status as a ''Tsukimono-suji'' would transfer to any man who married her.

==== Philippines ====
Witchcraft in [[the Philippines]] is often classified as malevolent, with practitioners of black magic called ''[[Mangkukulam]]'' in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] and ''[[Mambabarang]]'' in [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]]; there are also practitioners of benevolent, white magic, in addition to some who practise both. ''Mambabarang'' in particular are noted for their ability to command insects and other invertebrates to accomplish a task, such as delivering a curse to a target.

Magic and witchcraft in the Philippines varies considerably across the different [[Ethnic groups of the Philippines|ethnic groups]], and is commonly a modern manifestation of [[History of the Philippines (900-1521)|pre-Colonial]] spirituality interwoven with [[Catholicism in the Philippines|Catholic]] religious elements such as the invocation of [[saints]] and the use of [[pseudo-Latin]] prayers (''oración'') in spells, and ''[[anting-anting]]'' (amulets).

Practitioners of traditional herbal-based medicine and divination called ''[[albularyo]]'' are not considered witches. They are perceived to be either quack doctors or a quasi-magical option when western medicine fails to identify or cure an ailment that is thus suspected to be of supernatural, often malevolent, origin. [[Feng shui]], an influence of [[Filipino Chinese]] culture, is also not classified as witchcraft as it is considered a separate realm of belief altogether.

=== Europe ===
{{Main article|European witchcraft|Witch trials in Early Modern Europe}}
[[File:Die Hexe (Albrecht Dürer).jpg|thumb|left|[[Albrecht Dürer]] circa 1500: Witch Riding Backwards On A Goat]]
[[File:Sejdmen.jpg|thumb|During the Christianisation of Norway, King [[Olaf Trygvasson]] had male [[völva]]s (shamans) tied up and left on a [[skerry]] at [[tide|ebb]].]]Witchcraft in Europe between 500–1750 was believed to be a combination of sorcery and heresy. While sorcery attempts to produce negative supernatural effects through formulas and rituals, heresy is the Christian contribution to witchcraft in which an individual makes a pact with the Devil. In addition, heresy denies witches the recognition of important Christian values such as baptism, salvation, Christ and sacraments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=European Witchcraft|last=Monter|first=E. William|year=1969|isbn=|location=New York|pages=vii–viii}}&lt;/ref&gt; The beginning of the witch accusations in Europe took place in the 14th and 15th centuries; however as the social disruptions of the 16th century took place, witchcraft trials intensified.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite book|title=European Witch Trials: Their Foundations in Popular and Learned Culture, 1300–1500|last=Kiekhefer|first=Richard|publisher=Routledge|year=201|isbn=|location=|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Persecution of witches.jpg|thumb|[[Death by burning|Burning]] of witches.  Current scholarly estimates of the number of people executed for witchcraft vary between about 40,000 and 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Brian P. Levack]] (''The Witch Hunt in Early Modern Europe'') multiplied the number of known European witch trials by the average rate of conviction and execution, to arrive at a figure of around 60,000 deaths. [[Anne Lewellyn Barstow]] (''Witchcraze'') adjusted Levack's estimate to account for lost records, estimating 100,000 deaths. [[Ronald Hutton]] (''Triumph of the Moon'') argues that Levack's estimate had already been adjusted for these, and revises the figure to approximately 40,000.&lt;/ref&gt; The total number of witch trials in Europe known for certain to have ended in executions is around 12,000.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |title = Estimates of executions | url=http://www.summerlands.com/crossroads/remembrance/current.htm }} Based on [[Ronald Hutton]]'s essay ''Counting the Witch Hunt''.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In Early Modern European tradition, witches were stereotypically, though not exclusively, women.&lt;ref name="gibbons"&gt;Gibbons, Jenny (1998) "Recent Developments in the Study of the Great European Witch Hunt" in [http://www.equinoxjournals.com/ojs/index.php/POM ''The Pomegranate''] #5, Lammas 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drury, Nevill (1992) ''Dictionary of Mysticism and the Esoteric Traditions'' Revised Edition. Bridport, Dorset: Prism Press. "Witch".&lt;/ref&gt; European pagan belief in witchcraft was associated with the goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] and dismissed as "diabolical fantasies" by medieval Christian authors.&lt;ref&gt;[[Regino of Prüm]] (906), see Ginzburg (1990) part 2, ch. 1 (89ff.)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Witch-hunt]]s first appeared in large numbers in southern France and Switzerland during the 14th and 15th centuries. The peak years of witch-hunts in southwest [[Germany]] were from 1561 to 1670.&lt;ref&gt;H.C. [[Erik Midelfort]], Witch Hunting in Southwestern Germany 1562–1684, 1972,71&lt;/ref&gt;

It was commonly believed that individuals with power and prestige were involved in acts of witchcraft and even cannibalism.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Thornton, John. "Cannibals, Witches, and Slave Traders in the Atlantic World." The William and Mary Quarterly 60, no. 2 (2003): 282.&lt;/ref&gt; Because Europe had a lot of power over individuals living in West Africa, Europeans in positions of power were often accused of taking part in these practices. Though it is not likely that these individuals were actually involved in these practices, they were most likely associated due to Europe’s involvement in things like the slave trade, which negatively affected the lives of many individuals in the Atlantic World throughout the fifteenth through seventeenth centuries.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The familiar witch of [[folklore]] and popular [[superstition]] is a combination of numerous influences. The characterization of the witch as an evil magic user developed over time.

Early converts to Christianity looked to Christian clergy to work magic more effectively than the old methods under Roman paganism, and Christianity provided a methodology involving saints and relics, similar to the gods and amulets of the Pagan world. As Christianity became the dominant religion in Europe, its concern with magic lessened.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell-Stuart, P. G. (2000) "The Emergence of the Christian Witch" in ''History Today'', Nov, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Protestant Christian explanation for witchcraft, such as those typified in the confessions of the [[Pendle witches]], commonly involves a [[deal with the Devil|diabolical pact]] or at least an appeal to the intervention of the spirits of evil. The witches or wizards engaged in such practices were alleged to reject [[Jesus]] and the [[sacrament]]s; observe "[[Witches' Sabbath|the witches' sabbath]]" (performing infernal rites that often parodied the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] or other sacraments of the Church); pay Divine honour to [[Satan|the Prince of Darkness]]; and, in return, receive from him [[preternatural]] powers. It was a folkloric belief that a Devil's Mark, like the brand on cattle, was placed upon a witch's skin by the devil to signify that this pact had been made.&lt;ref&gt;Drymon, M.M. Disguised as the Devil: How Lyme Disease Created Witches and Changed History, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Witches were most often characterized as women. Witches disrupted the societal institutions, and more specifically, marriage. It was believed that a witch often joined a pact with the devil to gain powers to deal with infertility, immense fear for her children's well-being, or revenge against a lover. They were also depicted as lustful and perverted, and it was thought that they copulated with the devil at the Sabbath.

The Church and European society were not always so zealous in hunting witches or blaming them for misfortunes. [[Saint Boniface]] declared in the 8th century that belief in the existence of witches was un-Christian. The emperor [[Charlemagne]] decreed that the burning of supposed witches was a pagan custom that would be punished by the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]]. In 820 the [[Bishop of Lyon]] and others repudiated the belief that witches could make bad weather, fly in the night, and change their shape. This denial was accepted into [[Canon law]] . Other rulers such as [[Coloman, King of Hungary|King Coloman of Hungary]] declared that witch-hunts should cease because witches (more specifically, [[strigoi|strigas]]) do not exist.
[[File:Torturing and execution of witches in medieval miniature.jpg|thumb|Burning witches, with others held in Stocks, 14th century]]
The Church did not invent the idea of witchcraft as a potentially harmful force whose practitioners should be put to death. This idea is commonplace in pre-Christian religions. According to the scholar Max Dashu, the concept of medieval witchcraft contained many of its elements even before the emergence of Christianity. These can be found in [[Bacchanalia]]s, especially in the time when they were led by priestess [[Paculla Annia]] (188BC–186BC).

Powers typically attributed to European witches include turning food poisonous or inedible, flying on broomsticks or pitchforks, casting spells, cursing people, making livestock ill and crops fail, and creating fear and local chaos.

However, even at a later date, not all witches were assumed to be harmful practicers of the craft. In England, the provision of this curative magic was the job of a [[witch doctor]], also known as a [[cunning folk|cunning man]], [[white witch]], or wise man. The term "witch doctor" was in use in England before it came to be associated with Africa. [[Toad doctors]] were also credited with the ability to undo evil witchcraft. (Other folk magicians had their own purviews. [[Girdle-measurers]] specialised in diagnosing ailments caused by fairies, while magical cures for more mundane ailments, such as burns or toothache, could be had from [[Charmer (folklore)|charmer]]s.)

Historians [[Keith Thomas (historian)|Keith Thomas]] and his student [[Alan Macfarlane]] study witchcraft by combining historical research with concepts drawn from anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Thomas, ''Religion and the Decline of Magic'' (1971).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Barry, "Introduction: Keith Thomas and the problem of witchcraft" in  Jonathan Barry et al. eds., ''Witchcraft in early modern Europe: Studies in Culture and Belief'' (1996)  pp. 1–46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alan Macfarlane, ''Witchcraft in Tudor and Stuart England: A Regional and Comparative Study'' (1970).&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that English witchcraft, like African witchcraft, was endemic rather than epidemic. Older women were the favorite targets because they were marginal, dependent members of the community and therefore more likely to arouse feelings of both hostility and guilt, and less likely to have defenders of importance inside the community. Witchcraft accusations were the village's reaction to the breakdown of its internal community, coupled with the emergence of a newer set of values that was generating psychic stress.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke Garrett, ""Women and witches: Patterns of analysis." ''Signs'' 3#2 (1977): 461–470. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3173296 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Daemonologie1.jpg|thumb|Illustration of witches, perhaps being tortured before [[James VI and I|James VI]], from his ''[[Daemonologie]]'' (1597)]]
In Wales,  fear of witchcraft mounted around the year 1500.  There was a growing alarm of women's magic as a weapon aimed against the state and church. The Church made greater efforts to enforce the canon law of marriage, especially in Wales where tradition allowed a wider range of sexual partnerships. There was a political dimension as well, as accusations of witchcraft were levied against the enemies of Henry VII, who was exerting more and more control over Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen Kamerick, "Tanglost of Wales: Magic and Adultery in the Court of Chancery circa 1500." ''Sixteenth Century Journal'' 44#1 (2013) pp25-45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The records of the Courts of Great Sessions for Wales, 1536–1736 show that Welsh custom was more important than English law. Custom provided a framework of responding to witches and witchcraft in such a way that interpersonal and communal harmony was maintained, Showing to regard to the importance of honour, social place and cultural status. Even when found guilty, execution did not occur.&lt;ref&gt;Sally Parkin, "Witchcraft, women's honour and customary law in early modern Wales." ''Social History'' 31.3 (2006): 295–318.&lt;/ref&gt;

Becoming king in 1603,  [[James I]] Brought to England and Scotland continental explanations of witchcraft. His goal was to divert suspicion away from male [[homosociality]] among the elite, and focus fear on female communities and large gatherings of women. He thought they threatened his political power so he laid the foundation for witchcraft and occultism policies, especially in Scotland. The point was that a widespread belief in the conspiracy of witches and a witches' Sabbath with the devil deprived women of political influence. Occult power was supposedly a womanly trait because women were weaker and more susceptible to the devil.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Lolis, "The City of Witches: James I, the Unholy Sabbath, and the Homosocial Refashioning of the Witches’ Community." ''CLIO'' (2008) 37#3 pp 322–337.&lt;/ref&gt;

All these prayers were metrical, and were handed down from generation to generation with the utmost care. There were prayers for every such phase in life; for success in battle; for a change in wind (to overwhelm an adversary at sea, or that an intended voyage be propitious); that his crops may grow; to curse a thief; or wish ill-luck and death to his foes. Few men of middle age were without a number of these prayers or charms. The succession of a sorcerer was from father to son, or from uncle to nephew. So too of sorceresses: it would be from mother to daughter, or from aunt to niece. Sorcerers and sorceresses were often slain by relatives of their supposed victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Wyatt Gill|author-link=William Wyatt Gill|date=1892|title=The south Pacific and New Guinea, past and present; with notes on the Hervey group, an illustrative song and various myths|chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/southpacificnewg00gill#page/20/mode/2up|chapter=Wizards|publisher=Sydney: Charles Potter, Government Printer|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A singular enchantment was employed to kill off a husband of a pretty woman desired by someone else. The expanded flower of a [[Gardenia taitensis|Gardenia]] was stuck upright—a very difficult performance—in a cup (i.e., half a large coconut shell) of water. A prayer was then offered for the husbands speedy death, the sorcerer earnestly watching the flower. Should it fall the incantation was successful. But if the flower still remained upright, he will live. The sorcerer would in that case try his skill another day, with perhaps better success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Wyatt Gill|date=1892|title=The south Pacific and New Guinea, past and present; with notes on the Hervey group, an illustrative song and various myths|chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/southpacificnewg00gill#page/20/mode/2up|chapter=Wizards|publisher=Sydney: Charles Potter, Government Printer|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Beatrice Grimshaw]], a journalist who visited the Cook Islands in 1907, the uncrowned [[Makea Takau Ariki|Queen Makea]] was believed to have possessed the mystic power called ''[[mana]]'',  giving the possessor the power to slay at will. It also included other gifts, such as [[second sight]] to a certain extent, the power to bring [[luck|good or evil luck]], and the ability already mentioned to deal death at will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Beatrice Grimshaw|author-link=Beatrice Grimshaw|date=1908|title=In the Strange South Seas|chapterurl=https://archive.org/stream/instrangesouths00grimgoog#page/n112/mode/2up|chapter=A Mystic Power|publisher=London: Hutchinson &amp; Co.|pages=71–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vice News]]. January 6, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Russia ===
Among the [[Russian language|Russian]] words for ''witch'', ведьма (ved'ma) literally means "one who knows", from Old Slavic вѣдъ "to know").&lt;ref&gt;See also Ryan, W.F. ''The Bathhouse at Midnight: An Historical Survey of Magic and Divination in Russia'', [[Pennsylvania State University Press]], 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Another frequent term is колдунья (koldun'ya), ''sorcerer'' being колдун (koldun).

==== Spells ====
Pagan practices formed a part of Russian and Eastern Slavic culture; the Russian people were deeply superstitious. The witchcraft practiced consisted mostly of earth magic and herbology; it was not so significant which herbs were used in practices, but how these herbs were gathered. Ritual centered on harvest of the crops and the location of the sun was very important.&lt;ref&gt;Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 524.
&lt;/ref&gt;  One source, pagan author Judika Illes, tells that herbs picked on Midsummer's Eve were believed to be most powerful, especially if gathered on Bald Mountain near Kiev during the witches' annual revels celebration.&lt;ref&gt;
Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004,) page 252.&lt;/ref&gt; Botanicals should be gathered, "During the seventeenth minute of the fourteenth hour, under a dark moon, in the thirteenth field, wearing a red dress, pick the twelfth flower on the right."&lt;ref name="Judika Illes 2004 page 847"&gt;Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 847.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spells also served for midwifery, shape-shifting, keeping lovers faithful, and bridal customs. Spells dealing with midwifery and childbirth focused on the spiritual wellbeing of the baby.&lt;ref name="Judika Illes 2004 page 847"/&gt;  Shape-shifting spells involved invocation of the wolf as a spirit animal.&lt;ref&gt;
Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 623.&lt;/ref&gt; To keep men faithful, lovers would cut a ribbon the length of his erect penis and soak it in his seminal emissions after sex while he was sleeping, then tie seven knots in it; keeping this talisman of knot magic ensured loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 797.
&lt;/ref&gt;  Part of an ancient pagan marriage tradition involved the bride taking a ritual bath at a bathhouse before the ceremony. Her sweat would be wiped from her body using raw fish, and the fish would be cooked and fed to the groom.&lt;ref&gt;Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 705.&lt;/ref&gt;

Demonism, or black magic, was not prevalent. Persecution for witchcraft, mostly involved the practice of simple earth magic, founded on herbology, by solitary practitioners with a Christian influence. In one case investigators found a locked box containing something bundled in a kerchief and three paper packets, wrapped and tied, containing crushed grasses.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=3879463|title=Male Witches and Gendered Categories in Seventeenth-Century Russia|first=Valerie A.|last=Kivelson|date=1 January 2003|journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History|volume=45|issue=3|pages=606–631}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most rituals of witchcraft were very simple—one spell of divination consists of sitting alone outside meditating, asking the earth to show one's fate.&lt;ref&gt;
Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 313.&lt;/ref&gt;

While these customs were unique to Russian culture, they were not exclusive to this region. Russian pagan practices were often akin to paganism in other parts of the world. The Chinese concept of ''chi'', a form of energy that often manipulated in witchcraft, is known as bioplasma in Russian practices.&lt;ref&gt;Janet and Stewart Farrar, A Witches Bible: The Complete Witches' Handbook (Washington, Phoenix Publishing, Inc.) 1984. Page 316.
&lt;/ref&gt;  The western concept of an "evil eye" or a "hex" was translated to Russia as a "spoiler".&lt;ref&gt;Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 586.&lt;/ref&gt; A spoiler was rooted in envy, jealousy and malice. Spoilers could be made by gathering bone from a cemetery, a knot of the target's hair, burned wooden splinters and several herb Paris berries (which are very poisonous). Placing these items in sachet in the victim's pillow completes a spoiler.  The Sumerians, Babylonians, Assyrians, and the ancient Egyptians recognized the evil eye from as early as 3,000 BCE; in Russian practices it is seen as a sixteenth-century concept.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Buckland, The Witch Book: The Encyclopedia of Witchcraft, Wicca, and Neo-Paganism (Detroit: Visible Ink) 2002. Page 160.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Societal view of witchcraft ====
The dominant societal concern those practicing witchcraft was not whether paganism was effective, but whether it could cause harm.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;  Peasants in Russian and Ukrainian societies often shunned witchcraft, unless they needed help against supernatural forces. Impotence, stomach pains, barrenness, hernias, abscesses, epileptic seizures, and convulsions were all attributed to evil (or witchcraft). This is reflected in linguistics; there are numerous words for a variety of practitioners of paganism-based healers. Russian peasants referred to a witch as a ''chernoknizhnik'' (a person who plied his trade with the aid of a black book), ''sheptun''/''sheptun'ia'' (a "whisperer" male or female), ''lekar''/''lekarka'' or ''znakhar''/''znakharka'' (a male or female healer), or ''zagovornik'' (an incanter).&lt;ref&gt;
Christine D. Worobec, 1995. "Witchcraft Beliefs and Practices in Prerevolutionary Russian and Ukrainian Villages." Russian Review 54, no. 2: 165. Historical Abstracts, EBSCOhost (accessed November 21, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ironically enough, there was universal reliance on folk healers – but clients often turned them in if something went wrong. According to Russian historian Valerie A. Kivelson, witchcraft accusations were normally thrown at lower-class peasants, townspeople and Cossacks. People turned to witchcraft as a means to support themselves. The ratio of male to female accusations was 75% to 25%. Males were targeted more, because witchcraft was associated with societal deviation. Because single people with no settled home could not be taxed, males typically had more power than women in their dissent.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

The history of Witchcraft had evolved around society. More of a psychological concept to the creation and usage of Witchcraft can create the assumption as to why women are more likely to follow the practices behind Witchcraft. Identifying with the soul of an individual’s self is often deemed as "feminine" in society. There is analyzed social and economic evidence to associate between witchcraft and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peterson|first1=Mark|title=Damned Women: Sinners and Witches in Puritan New England|journal=ProQuest|date=1998|volume=67|issue= 1|pages=192–194|doi=10.2307/3170836|jstor=3170836}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Witchcraft trials ====
[[File:"A true and just recorde of the information"; title page Wellcome M0012987.jpg|thumb|''A true and iust Recorde, of the Information, Examination and Confession of all witches...'']]

Witchcraft trials occurred frequently in seventeenth-century Russia, although the "great witch-hunt" is believed{{by whom|date=January 2014}} to be a predominately Western European phenomenon.  However, as the witchcraft-trial craze swept across Catholic and Protestant countries during this time, Orthodox Christian Europe indeed partook in this so-called "witch hysteria."  This involved the persecution of both males and females who were believed to be practicing paganism, herbology, the black art, or a form of sorcery within and/or outside their community.  Very early on witchcraft legally fell under the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical body, the church, in Kievan Rus' and Muscovite Russia.&lt;ref&gt;
Russell Zguta, "Witchcraft Trials in Seventeenth-Century Russia," American Historical Review 82, no. 5 (December 1977), 1190.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sources of ecclesiastical witchcraft jurisdiction date back as early as the second half of the eleventh century, one being [[Vladimir the Great]]'s first edition of his State Statute or ''Ustav'', another being multiple references in the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'' beginning in 1024.&lt;ref&gt;Zguta, 1190.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Nothing could be done about it LACMA 63.11.24.jpg|thumb|Goya's drawing of result of a presumed witch's trial: " [so she must be a witch]"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Inquisition Unmasked: Being an Historical and Philosophical Account of that Tremendous Tribunal, Founded on Authentic Documents; and Exhibiting the Necessity of Its Suppression, as a Means of Reform and Regeneration, Written and Published at a Time when the National Congress of Spain was about to Deliberate on this Important Measure|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=aqRCAAAAYAAJ|publisher = Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy|date = 1816-01-01|first = Antonio|last = Puigblanch}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The sentence for an individual found guilty of witchcraft or sorcery during this time, and in previous centuries, typically included either burning at the stake or being tested with the "ordeal of cold water" or ''judicium aquae frigidae''.&lt;ref name="Zguta, 1189"&gt;Zguta, 1189.&lt;/ref&gt;  The cold-water test was primarily a Western European phenomenon, but was used as a method of truth in Russia prior to, and post, seventeenth-century witchcraft trials in Muscovy.  Accused persons who submerged were considered innocent, and ecclesiastical authorities would proclaim them "brought back," but those who floated were considered guilty of practicing witchcraft, and burned at the stake or executed in an unholy fashion. The thirteenth-century bishop of Vladimir, Serapion Vladimirskii, preached sermons throughout the Muscovite countryside, and in one particular sermon revealed that burning was the usual punishment for witchcraft, but more often the cold water test was used as a precursor to execution.&lt;ref name="Zguta, 1189"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/dictionary/brewers/cold-water-ordeal.html|title=Cold Water Ordeal|website=Infoplease.com|accessdate=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although these two methods of torture were used in the west and the east, Russia implemented a system of fines payable for the crime of witchcraft during the seventeenth century.  Thus, even though torture methods in Muscovy were on a similar level of harshness as Western European methods used, a more civil method was present.  In the introduction of a collection of trial records pieced together by Russian scholar Nikolai Novombergsk, he argues that Muscovite authorities used the same degree of cruelty and harshness as Western European Catholic and Protestant countries in persecuting witches.&lt;ref&gt;
Zguta, 1187.&lt;/ref&gt;  By the mid-sixteenth century the manifestations of paganism, including witchcraft, and the black arts—astrology, fortune telling, and divination—became a serious concern to the Muscovite church and state.&lt;ref name="Zguta, 1191"&gt;Zguta, 1191.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tsar [[Ivan the Terrible|Ivan IV]] (reigned 1547–1584) took this matter to the ecclesiastical court and was immediately advised that individuals practicing these forms of witchcraft should be excommunicated and given the death penalty.&lt;ref name="Zguta, 1191"/&gt;  Ivan IV, as a true believer in witchcraft, was deeply convinced{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} that sorcery accounted for the death of his wife, [[Anastasia Romanovna|Anastasiia]] in 1560, which completely devastated and depressed him, leaving him heartbroken.&lt;ref&gt;Zguta, 1193.&lt;/ref&gt;  Stemming from this belief, Ivan IV became majorly concerned with the threat of witchcraft harming his family, and feared he was in danger. So, during the [[Oprichnina]] (1565–1572), Ivan IV succeeded in accusing and charging a good number of boyars with witchcraft whom he did not wish to remain as nobles.  Rulers after Ivan IV, specifically during the [[Time of Troubles]] (1598–1613), increased the fear of witchcraft among themselves and entire royal families, which then led to further preoccupation with the fear of prominent Muscovite witchcraft circles.&lt;ref&gt;Zguta, 1193–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Time of Troubles, seventeenth-century Muscovite rulers held frequent investigations of witchcraft within their households, laying the ground, along with previous tsarist reforms, for widespread witchcraft trials throughout the Muscovite state.&lt;ref&gt;Zguta, 1195.&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 1622 and 1700 ninety-one people were brought to trial in Muscovite courts for witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;Zguta, 1196.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Russia did partake in the witch craze that swept across Western Europe, the Muscovite state did not persecute nearly as many people for witchcraft, let alone execute a number of individuals anywhere close to the number executed in the west during the witch hysteria.

== Witches in art ==
Witches have a long history of being depicted in art, although most of their earliest artistic depictions seem to originate in Early Modern Europe, particularly the Medieval and Renaissance periods. Many scholars attribute their manifestation in art as inspired by texts such as ''Canon Episcopi'', a demonology-centered work of literature, and ''Malleus Maleficarum'', a "witch-craze" manual published in 1487, by Heinrich Kramer and Jacob Sprenger.&lt;ref&gt;Simons, Patricia. "THE INCUBUS AND ITALIAN RENAISSANCE ART." Source: ''Notes in the History of Art'' 34.1 (2014): 1–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Canon Episcopi'', a ninth-century text that explored the subject of demonology, initially introduced concepts that would continuously be associated with witches, such as their ability to fly or their believed fornication and sexual relations with the devil. The text refers to two women, Diana the Huntress and Herodias, who both express the duality of female sorcerers. Diana was described as having a heavenly body and as the "protectress of childbirth and fertility" while Herodias symbolized "unbridled sensuality". They thus represent the mental powers and cunning sexuality that witches used as weapons to trick men into performing sinful acts which would result in their eternal punishment. These characteristics were distinguished as Medusa-like or Lamia-like traits when seen in any artwork (Medusa's mental trickery was associated with Diana the Huntress's psychic powers and Lamia was a rumored female figure in the Medieval ages sometimes used in place of Herodias).&lt;ref&gt;Lorenzi, Lorenzo. ''Witches. Exploring the iconography of the sorceress and enchantress''. (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;
   
One of the first individuals to regularly depict witches after the witch-craze of the medieval period was [[Albrecht Dürer]], a German Renaissance artist. His famous 1497 engraving ''[[The Four Witches]]'', portrays four physically attractive and seductive nude witches. Their supernatural identities are emphasized by the skulls and bones lying at their feet as well as the devil discreetly peering at them from their left. The women's sensuous presentation speaks to the overtly sexual nature they were attached to in early modern Europe. Moreover, this attractiveness was perceived as a danger to ordinary men who they could seduce and tempt into their sinful world.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some scholars interpret this piece as utilizing the logic of the ''Canon Episcopi'', in which women used their mental powers and bodily seduction to enslave and lead men onto a path of eternal damnation, differing from the unattractive depiction of witches that would follow in later Renaissance years.&lt;ref&gt;Stumpel, Jeroen. “The Foul Fowler Found out: On a Key Motif in Dürer's ‘Four Witches.’” Simiolus: ''Netherlands Quarterly for the History of Art'', vol. 30, no. 3/4, 2003, pp. 143–160., www.jstor.org/stable/3780914.&lt;/ref&gt;
   
Dürer also employed other ideas from the Middle Ages that were commonly associated with witches. Specifically, his art often referred to former 12th- to 13th-century Medieval iconography addressing the nature of female sorcerers. In the Medieval period, there was a widespread fear of witches, accordingly producing an association of dark, intimidating characteristics with witches, such as cannibalism (witches described as "[sucking] the blood of newborn infants"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;) or described as having the ability to fly, usually on the back of black goats. As the Renaissance period began, these concepts of witchcraft were suppressed, leading to a drastic change in the sorceress' appearances, from sexually explicit beings to the 'ordinary' typical housewives of this time period. This depiction, known as the 'Waldensian' witch became a cultural phenomenon of early Renaissance art. The term originates from the 12th-century monk Peter Waldo, who established his own religious sect which explicitly opposed the luxury and commodity-influenced lifestyle of the Christian church clergy, and whose sect was excommunicated before being persecuted as "practitioners of witchcraft and magic".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Subsequent artwork exhibiting witches tended to consistently rely on cultural stereotypes about these women. These stereotypes were usually rooted in early Renaissance religious discourse, specifically the Christian belief that an "earthly alliance" had taken place between Satan's female minions who "conspired to destroy Christendom".&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Hoak, Dale. "THE EUROPEAN WITCHCRAZE REVISITED, PT 2, WITCH-HUNTING AND WOMEN IN THE ART OF THE RENAISSANCE." ''History Today'' 31.FEB (1981): 22–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another significant artist whose art consistently depicted witches was Dürer's apprentice, Hans Baldung Grien, a 15th-century German artist. His chiaroscuro woodcut, ''Witches'', created in 1510, visually encompassed all the characteristics that were regularly assigned to witches during the Renaissance. Social beliefs labeled witches as supernatural beings capable of doing great harm, possessing the ability to fly, and as cannibalistic.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The urn in ''Witches'' seems to contain pieces of the human body, which the witches are seen consuming as a source of energy. Meanwhile, their nudity while feasting is recognized as an allusion to their sexual appetite, and some scholars read the witch riding on the back of a goat-demon as representative of their "flight-inducing [powers]". This connection between women's sexual nature and sins was thematic in the pieces of many Renaissance artists, especially Christian artists, due to cultural beliefs which characterized women as overtly sexual beings who were less capable (in comparison to men) of resisting sinful temptation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[File:Religijne symbole0.png|thumb|right|The world religions paradigm selects a small number of religious groups which it classes as 'major'.]]
'''World religions''' is a category used in the [[Religious studies|study of religion]] to demarcate the five—and in some cases six—largest and most internationally widespread religious movements. [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], [[Hinduism]], and [[Buddhism]] are always included in the list, being known as the "Big Five". Some scholars also include another religion, such as [[Sikhism]], [[Zoroastrianism]], or the [[Bahá'í Faith]], in the category. 

The world religions paradigm was developed in the United Kingdom in the 1960s, where it was pioneered by [[phenomenology of religion|phenomenological]] scholars like [[Ninian Smart]]. It was designed to broaden the study of religion away from its heavy focus on Christianity by taking into account other large religious traditions around the world.  
The paradigm is often used by lecturers instructing undergraduate students in the study of religion and is also the framework used by school teachers in the UK and other countries. The paradigm's emphasis on viewing these religious movements as distinct and mutually exclusive entities has also had a wider impact on the categorisation of religion—for instance in censuses—in both Western countries and elsewhere.

Since the late twentieth century, the paradigm has faced critique by scholars of religion like [[Jonathan Z. Smith]], some of whom have argued for its abandonment. Critics have argued that the world religions paradigm is inappropriate because it takes the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] variant of Christianity as the model for what constitutes religion; that it is tied up with discourses of modernity, including modern power relations; that it encourages an uncritical understanding of religion; and that it makes a value judgement as to what religions should be considered "major". Others have argued that it remains useful in the classroom, so long as students are made aware that it is a socially constructed category.

==Definition==

The scholars of religion Christopher R. Cotter and David G. Robertson described the "World Religions Paradigm" as "a particular way of thinking about religions which organizes them into a set of discrete traditions with a supposedly 'global' import."{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016a|p=vii}} It typically consists of the "Big Five" religions: [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]], [[Islam]], [[Hinduism]], and [[Buddhism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Owen|1y=2011|1p=254|2a1=Cotter|2a2=Robertson|2y=2016b|2p=2}} 
As noted by Cotter and Robertson, the "Big Five" religions are often listed in an "Abrahamocentric order" which places the largest three [[Abrahamic religions]]—Christianity, Judaism, and Islam—before the non-Abrahamic religions Hinduism and Buddhism.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=2}} The category is sometimes also extended to include other religious groups, namely [[Sikhism]], [[Zoroastrianism]], and the [[Bahá'í Faith]].{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=254}}

The inclusion of Judaism in the Big Five raises some issues; it is included in the list because of its influence on Christianity and Islam and because of its relevance to traditional Western understandings of Western history.{{sfn|Taira|2016|p=80}} On demographic grounds, it does not fit into the list, for there are far fewer Jews in the world than there are Christians, Muslims, Hindus, and Buddhists.{{sfn|Taira|2016|p=80}} Similarly, it does not fit into the list if the groups are defined by a desire to spread internationally, because Judaism is typically non-proselytizing.{{sfn|Taira|2016|p=80}}

Many scholars have utilised the "World Religions" category alongside other "catch-all" categories such as "[[new religious movements]]" and "[[indigenous religions]]".{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=2}} The scholar Steven J. Sutcliffe compared the relationship between the three categories to the [[English football league system]], with the "world" religions forming a [[Premier League]], the "new" religions forming a [[EFL Championship|Championship]], and "indigenous" religions a [[Football League First Division|First Division]].{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2016|p=26}} That groups that get placed in categories like "indigenous religions" get treated less seriously than the "world religions" by many scholars was noted by the scholar of religion Graham Harvey, who maintained that "indigenous religions should receive similarly respectful treatment to that considered appropriate to the larger 'World Religions'."{{sfn|Harvey|2000|p=3}}

==History==

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=While the World Religions paradigm was brought in to allow the inclusion of non-Christian religions in education, it has instead remodelled them according to liberal Western Protestant Christian values (akin to what the [[Church of England]] promotes), emphasizing theological categories..|source=— Scholar of religion Suzanne Owen, 2011{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=258}} }}

Cotter and Robertson noted that the history of the world religions paradigm is "intimately tied up" with the history of the study of religion as an academic discipline.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=3}} It emerged from within the [[phenomenology of religion]] approach which placed an emphasis on description rather than critical analysis.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=258}} 

The paradigm was integrated throughout the education system through work of scholars like [[Ninian Smart]], who formed the Shap Working Party on World Religions in Education in 1969.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=254}} It was introduced with the intent of moving Western education away from its focus on Christianity.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=254}} However, it took liberal Western Protestantism as its baseline and interpreted these different religious traditions through the framework of liberal Protestant norms and values.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=254}} This included an emphasis on [[theology]] as being central to a given religion.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=254}} It also reflects the post-Enlightenment Christian approach of treating different religious groups as distinct, mutually exclusive categories.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=260}} It thus reflects the socio-political concerns of 1960s Britain, the environment in which it was devised.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=259}}

The paradigm has since gone beyond this academic discipline, and "informs the perception" of many members of different religious groups.{{sfn|Ramey|2016|p=50}} The paradigm for instance frames the teaching about religion in the British education system; at all three [[Key Stage]]s, British teachers are instructed to teach about Christianity, while by the end of key Stage 3 they are also supposed to teach about the other "five principal religions": Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, and Sikhism.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=263}} Similarly, the censuses of many countries for instance reflect the influence of the world religion paradigm by only permitting respondents to describe themselves as adhering to one particular religious tradition, whereas in reality many individuals identify themselves with various different traditions at the same time.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=260}} This idea of mutually exclusive religious identities is not only a Western phenomenon, but can also be found in other socio-cultural contexts; [[Hindu nationalism|Hindu nationalists]] for instance often endorse the idea that Hinduism and Buddhism are mutually exclusive categories despite the fact that many people in South Asia mix Hindu and Buddhist practices.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=260}}
The scholars of religion Tara Baldrick-Morrone, Michael Graziano, and Brad Stoddard stated that "the WRP is neither neutral nor natural, but its social authority derives from appearing as both."{{sfn|Baldrick-Morrone|Graziano|Stoddard|2016|p=38}}

==Criticism==

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=[A 'world religion' is] a tradition that has achieved sufficient power and numbers to enter our history to form it, interact with it, or thwart it. We recognise both the unity within and the diversity among the world religions because they correspond to important geopolitical entities with which we must deal. All 'primitives,' by way of contrast, may be lumped together, as may the 'minor religions,' because they do not confront our history in any direct fashion. From the point of view of power, they are invisible.|source=— Scholar of religion [[J. Z. Smith]], 1998{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=8}} }}

The utility of the  World Religions Paradigm has experienced a sustained and rigorous critique from many scholars of religion.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=7}} In 1978, the scholar of religion [[Jonathan Z. Smith]] for example called it a "dubious category".{{sfn|Smith|1978|p=295}}

One of the major criticisms of the framework is that it is based on a model of 'religion' that is highly reliant on using the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] version of Christianity as its base example.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=7}} A second criticism is that it is rooted in the discourses of modernity, including the [[power relations]] present in modern society.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=7}} Smith observed that it was constructed by Western scholars from a Western perspective. He noted that the only religions that get included in it are those which have "achieved sufficient power and numbers to enter our [i.e. Western] history, either to form it, interact with it, or to thwart it" and represent "important geo-political entities with which we must deal."{{sfn|Smith|1978|p=295}} The framework also includes privileging the literate elites active in particular religious movements by presenting their interpretations of particular traditions as being authoritative, eclipsing alternative interpretations presented by non-literate, marginalised, and localized practitioners.{{sfnm|1a1=Owen|1y=2011|1p=255|2a1=Cotter|2a2=Robertson|2y=2016b|2pp=8–9}} For instance, as noted by the scholar of religion Suzanne Owen, "Hinduism as a World Religion does not include Hinduism as a village religion".{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=255}}

A third criticism of the world religions paradigm is that it encourages an uncritical and ''sui generis'' model of 'religion'.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=7}} It presents each of the 'world religions' in an abstracted and essentialised form, failing to take account of hybridization.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=259}} For instance, in teaching about Christianity it does not refer to [[reincarnation]], because this is not typically regarded as a Christian doctrine, and yet there are Christians who profess a belief in reincarnation.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=259}}
A fourth criticism is that in choosing to focus attention on the "major" religions, it makes a value judgement as to what constitutes "major" and what does not.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=12}} 

===Paradigm in pedagogy===

Many scholars of religion have resisted efforts to challenge the paradigm,{{sfn|Cox|2016|p=xii}} and as of 2016 was reported as still being widespread in university introductory courses to the study of religion.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=10}} Many instructors feel that explaining the critique of the world religions paradigm to undergraduate students would be difficult, as the critique would be too complex for many of them to understand.{{sfn|Ramey|2016|p=49}} Its continued use has also been defended by the claim that it is what undergraduate students expect and that it mirrors what they will have been taught at school.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=254}}

Some scholars have argued for the rejection of the world religions paradigm altogether; Cotter and Robertson presented the argument that "the continued uncritical use of the WRP fosters a breeding ground for relativistic navel-gazing which has no place in the contemporary research university".{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=10}} Owen was of the view that "as long as it continues to employ the World Religions paradigm as a default approach (even after deconstructing it), religious studies will fail in its humanistic task" because it will simply be engaging in "knowledge transfer" and not "critically engaging" with "culture and knowledge".{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=257}} One alternative framework that some scholars use to teach about religion is the "[[lived religion]]" paradigm, which places emphasis not on distinct religious traditions but on individual experiences and practices.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=12}} Another alternative is the "[[material religion]]" framework which focuses on examining religion through [[material culture]] and physical objects.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|pp=12–13}} Owen noted that, in her experience, many students display an "initial resistance to alternatives" as they are expecting the world religions paradigm. She cited the example of her introductory course at [[Leeds Trinity University College]], which was constructed on thematic lines rather than according to the world religions paradigm, and which induced feelings of panic among many undergraduates.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=258}}

Many scholars who are critical of the world religions paradigm find themselves having to teach it as part of introductory courses for undergraduate students.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=258}} Some spent much of a course teaching the concept and then several sessions after this deconstructing it.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=258}} Some scholars have suggested that even when students are taught using the world religions paradigm, it could be a good means of encouraging them to think critically about category formation.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=13}} The scholar Steven W. Ramey for instance advocated teaching the paradigm in a manner that makes it clear that it is a "constructed discourse".{{sfn|Ramey|2016|p=48}} Similarly, Baldrick-Morrone, Graziano, and Stoddard suggested that teaching undergraduates about the world religious paradigm helps to explain to students how "classification is a social act".{{sfn|Baldrick-Morrone|Graziano|Stoddard|2016|p=39}} They noted that students could leave such a course not only knowing more about the specific religious traditions included in the world religions category, but that they would also leave "knowing how to better interrogate the world around them".{{sfn|Baldrick-Morrone|Graziano|Stoddard|2016|p=39}} To avoid promoting the paradigm's portrayal of different religious traditions as rigid, homogenous categories, the scholar Teemu Taira suggested introducing [[ethnography|ethnographic]] case studies into the class to better explain the realities of people's lives and uses of religious traditions.{{sfn|Taira|2016|p=82}}
