      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1118">'''Academic job market''' refers to the pool of vacant teaching and administrative positions in [[Academia]], i.e. in institutions of Higher Education such as universities and colleges, and also to the competition for these positions, and the mechanisms for advertising and filling them. This job market differs somewhat from other job markets because of such institutions as tenure. It is frequently a subject of debate relating to questions of openness, discrimination and [[reverse discrimination]], and political interference.

The Academic job market, like the structure of academic careers, operates somewhat differently in different countries.

'''AUSL''' ('''Academy for Urban School Leadership''') is a Chicago nonprofit school management organization founded in 2001. Today, it manages 31 [[Chicago Public Schools]] serving more than 16,000 students. Over 1,045 teachers have graduated from the AUSL Chicago Teacher Residency.&lt;ref&gt;"About AUSL" http://auslchicago.org/about&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Former Chicago Public Schools (CPS) President [[Arne Duncan]] met with financier Martin Koldyke and CPS educator Dr. Donald Feinstein and developed the idea of creating a specialized training program for teachers in urban schools. That led to the development of the Chicago Teacher Residency.&lt;ref&gt;"The History of AUSL" http://auslchicago.org/about&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chicago Teacher Residency Program==
[[File:Chicago Teacher Residency Class of 2012.jpg|250px|thumbnail|right|The Chicago Teacher Residency Class of 2012]]
The centerpiece of AUSL's efforts is the '''Chicago Teacher Residency''' program, a year-long urban teacher training program in Chicago's Public Schools. The 12-month, full-time, paid training program combines teacher preparation, licensure, and a master's degree.

After the training year, graduates commit to teach in an AUSL-managed [[Chicago Public School]] for at least four years.&lt;ref&gt;"Chicago Teacher Residency" http://auslchicago.org/residency&lt;/ref&gt;

==Network of Schools==
[[File:AUSL Network of Schools Map.png|alt=AUSL Network of Schools Map|thumb|330x330px|AUSL Network of Schools Map]]
AUSL manages 31 [[Chicago Public Schools]] serving over 16,000 students. AUSL schools operate within the CPS system.&lt;ref&gt;"AUSL Schools" http://auslchicago.org/schools&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independent Research===
[[University of Chicago School of Social Service Administration#Consortium on Chicago School Research|The University of Chicago Consortium on Chicago School Research]] and [[American Institutes for Research]] in 2012 released a summary from their independent research evaluating the effect of reform including AUSL schools&lt;ref&gt;"Turning Around Low-Performing Schools in Chicago" February 2012 http://ccsr.uchicago.edu/publications/turning-around-low-performing-schools-chicago&lt;/ref&gt; The study concluded the following:
* Four years after intervention, the gap in test scores between reformed elementary/middle schools and the school system average closed by almost half in reading and by two-thirds in mathematics.
* The teacher workforce after intervention across all models was more likely to be white, younger, and less experienced, and were more likely to have provisional certification than teachers who were at those schools before the intervention.
* Without intervention, the comparison neighborhood schools saw minimal to no increases in average test scores.
* Furthermore, these significant results were achieved serving the same students as before intervention.
* Transformation of an elementary school is a process, not an event. The gains seen in the fourth year vs. the comparison schools are higher than those seen in the first year.
* High schools that underwent reform did not show significant improvements in absences or ninth grade on-track-to-graduate rates over matched comparison schools, but recent high school efforts look more promising than earlier ones.

==Criticism==

A [[Chicago Tribune]] article on AUSL from February 2012 entitled "School reform organization gets average grades"
&lt;ref&gt;"School reform organization gets average grades"  http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-02-06/news/ct-met-cps-turnaround-20120206_1_turnaround-schools-urban-school-leadership-ausl&lt;/ref&gt; stated that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Most of AUSL turnarounds score below CPS averages on the percentage of students meeting or exceeding state benchmarks on standardized testing. Those schools that beat district averages have been accused of pushing out their lowest-performing students or those with discipline problems to artificially inflate their test scores.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Adolescent egocentrism''' is a term that [[David Elkind]] used to describe the phenomenon of adolescents' inability to distinguish between their perception of what others think about them and what people actually think in reality.&lt;ref name=Elkindeia /&gt;  David Elkind's theory on adolescent egocentrism is drawn from [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development|Piaget's theory on cognitive developmental stages]], which argues that formal operations enable adolescents to construct imaginary situations and abstract thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Inhelder &amp; Piaget|title=The growth of logical thinking from childhood to adolescence|date=1958|publisher=Basic Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Accordingly, adolescents are able to conceptualize their own thoughts and conceive of other people's thoughts.&lt;ref name=Elkindeia&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elkind|first=David|title=Egocentrism in Adolescence|journal=Child Development|date=1967|volume=38 | issue = 4|pages=1025–1034|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1967.tb04378.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Elkind pointed out that adolescents tend to focus mostly on their own perceptions – especially on their behaviors and appearance – because of the "physiological metamorphosis" they experience during this period. This leads to adolescents' belief that other people are as attentive to their behaviors and appearance as they are of themselves.&lt;ref name=Elkindeia /&gt; According to Elkind, adolescent egocentrism results in two consequential mental constructions, namely [[imaginary audience]] and [[personal fable]].

==Mental constructions==

===Imaginary audience===
{{main article|Imaginary audience}}
Imaginary audience is a term that Elkind used to describe the phenomenon that an adolescent anticipates the reactions of other people to him/herself in actual or impending social situations. Elkind argued that this kind of anticipation could be explained by the adolescent's preoccupation that others are as admiring or as critical of him as he is of himself. As a result, an audience is created, as the adolescent believes that he/she will be the focus of attention.&lt;ref name=Elkindeia /&gt;

However, more often than not the audience is imaginary because in actual social situations always being the focus of public attention is not usually the case.&lt;ref name=Elkindeia /&gt; Elkind believed that the construction of imaginary audiences would partially account for a wide variety of typical adolescent behaviors and experiences; and imaginary audiences played a role in the self-consciousness that emerges in early adolescence. However, since the audience is usually the adolescent's own construction, it is privy to his or her own knowledge of him/herself.&lt;ref name=Elkindeia /&gt;

According to Elkind, the notion of imaginary audience helps to explain why adolescents usually seek privacy and feel reluctant to reveal themselves – it is a reaction to the feeling that one is constantly under the critical scrutiny of others.

===Personal fable===
{{main article|Personal fable}}
Elkind addressed that adolescents have a complex set of beliefs that their own feelings are unique and they are special and immortal. '''Personal fable''' is the term Elkind created to describe this notion, which is the complement of the construction of imaginary audience. Since an adolescent usually fails to differentiate his focus on his own perceptions and that of others, he tends to believe that he is of importance to so many people (the imaginary audiences) that he comes to regard his feelings as something special and unique.&lt;ref name=Elkindeia /&gt; This belief in personal uniqueness and invincibility becomes an illusion that he can be above some of the rules, disciplines and laws that apply to other people; even consequences such as death {{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}. Due to the existence of personal fable at some point, an adolescent tends to substitute the roles of an idol, a hero or even a god with his own image.&lt;ref name=Elkindeia /&gt;

==Passing==
Elkind believed that adolescent [[egocentrism]] was a temporary phenomenon that will gradually diminish as adolescents grow older. The reason of this, Elkind argued, was because after entering the formal operational stage, no new mental systems would develop. Therefore, the mental structures formed during adolescence would continue to function for the rest of the life span.&lt;ref name=Elkindeia /&gt; Accordingly, the two mental constructions that result from egocentrism, imaginary audience and personal fable, will gradually be overcome and disappear as formal operations become mature and stable.&lt;ref name=Elkindeia /&gt;

===Passing of imaginary audience===
The imaginary audience, Elkind said, could be regarded as "a series of hypotheses" that an adolescent "tests against reality". Because the imaginary audience is usually constructed based on an adolescent's attention on his own perception, it will be gradually modified through communicating and reacting with real audiences. Eventually, adolescents will be able to recognize the difference between his own preoccupations and concerns of others.&lt;ref name=Elkindeia /&gt;

===Passing of personal fable===
As to the passing of personal fable, Elkind's idea was drawn from Erikson's (1959) stages of psychosocial development. An establishment of what Erikson called "intimacy"&lt;ref name=Erikson1959&gt;{{cite book|last=Erik.H|first=Erikson|title=Identity and the life cycle|date=1959|publisher=New York: International Universities Press|location=Psychological issues v. 1, no. 1, monograph 1.|isbn=0393012468|pages=181–191}}&lt;/ref&gt;  could account for the elimination of personal fable, because during the process of establishing "intimacy", adolescents have to constantly adjust their imaginary audiences to the real ones. As a result, adolescents are able to see themselves in a more realistic way and to establish meaningful interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref name=Elkindeia /&gt;

==Discussions==
A lot of research has examined different dimensions of Elkind's concept of adolescent egocentrism, however, the findings have not well supported the concept.&lt;ref name=Maholmes&amp;Lomonaco&gt;{{cite book|author=Smetana, J.G. |author2=VillaLobos M. |last-author-amp=yes|title=Applied Research in Child &amp; Adolescent Development: A practical guide, edited by Maholmes&amp;Lomonaco|date=2010|publisher=New York :Psychology Press|pages=187–228}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to this research, the manifestation of adolescent egocentrism is not a normative developmental phenomenon that occurs only during adolescence, but varies across different contexts.&lt;ref name=Maholmes&amp;Lomonaco /&gt; Main discussions from current literature focus on three aspects: whether adolescent egocentrism is age-related; whether adolescent egocentrism has association with formal operations; whether adolescent egocentrism weigh equally across genders.

===Not being age-related===
In his 1967 work, Elkind claimed that adolescent egocentrism emerges during early adolescence (age 11–12) and gradually dissipates throughout middle and late adolescence.&lt;ref name=Elkindeia /&gt; However, some findings from later studies indicate that this statement is not necessarily to be accurate. In 1986, Lapsley and his colleagues conducted two studies to examine the theoretical assumptions brought up by Elkind.&lt;ref name=Lapsley1986&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lapsley, D.K.|title=Adolescent egocentrism and formal operations: Tests of a Theorectical Assumption|journal=Developmental Psychology|date=1986|volume=22|pages=800–807|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.22.6.800|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their first study they collected data from a sample that included 45 sixth graders, 39 eighth graders, 50 tenth graders and 49 twelfth graders. They used the Adolescent Egocentrism Scale (AES) developed by Enright et al. (1979, 1980)&lt;ref name=Enright1979&gt;{{cite journal|last=Enright, R. |author2=Lapsley, D. |author3=Shukla, D. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Adolescent egocentrism in early and late adolescence|journal=Adolescence|date=1979|volume=14|pages=687–695}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Enright1980&gt;{{cite journal |author=Enright, R. |author2=Shukla, D. |author3=Lapsley, D. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Adolescent egocentrism-sociocentrism and self-consciousness|journal=Journal of youth and Adolescence|date=1980|volume=9|pages=101–116|doi=10.1007/bf02087929}}&lt;/ref&gt; and paper-and-pencil battery of formal operations tasks developed by Lunzer (1965)&lt;ref name=Lunzer1965&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lunzer, E.|title=Problems of formal reasoning in test situations. In P. Mussen(Ed.), European research in cognitive development [Special issue]|journal=Monographs for the Society for Research in Child Development|date=1965|volume=30(2, Serial No. 100)|pages=19–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; as measuring instruments to examine the correlation between adolescent egocentrism and formal operational thought. 

If Elkind's assumption were right, the correlation was supposed to change from positive to negative as the grade increased and the magnitude of the correlation should decrease with age. The results of the study obtained only significant negative correlation in late adolescence and non-significant change in the magnitude of the correlation. The results didn't support the Elkind's claim that adolescent egocentrism emerges in early adolescence and decreases linearly throughout middle and late adolescence.  In other words, adolescents aged 11 or 12 could experience adolescent egocentrism of the same magnitude as those aged 15 or 16 do. Another study by Frankenberger (2000) also provides evidence that adolescent egocentrism is not age-related.&lt;ref name=Frankenberger2000&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frankenberger, K.D.|title=Adolescent egocentrism: a comparison among adolescents and adults|journal=Journal of Adolescence 2000|date=2000|volume=23|pages=343–354|doi=10.1006/jado.2000.0319}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In this study, a survey was conducted for data collection from 223 adolescents and 131 adults. The survey contained measures of three aspects: adolescent egocentrism, self-consciousness, and interpersonal reactivity. The result revealed that scores of egocentrism were not, on average, significantly different between adolescents and young adults (19-30), which indicates that egocentrism in adolescence may continue into adulthood.

===Little association with formal operations===
An important theoretical assumption in Elkind's theory is that the emergence of adolescence egocentrism is a result of the development of formal operational thoughts.&lt;ref name=Elkindeia /&gt; Nevertheless, some studies had findings that were contrast to Elkind's position. Lapsley and his colleagues conducted two studies to examine the theoretical assumptions in 1986.&lt;ref name=Lapsley1986 /&gt; In the second study, they analyzed the data obtained from two samples: a sample of 7th-, 9th-and 11th-graders and another sample of college undergraduate students. They used Adolescent Egocentrism Scale (AES) (Enright et al., 1979, 1980),&lt;ref name=Enright1979 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Enright1980 /&gt; Lunzer (1965)&lt;ref name=Lunzer1965 /&gt; formal operations measure and Imaginary Audience Scale (IAS) (Elkind &amp; Bowen, 1979)&lt;ref name=Elkind1979&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elkind, D. |author2=Bowen, R. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Imaginary audience behavior in children and adolescents|journal=Developmental Psychology|date=1979|volume=15|pages=38–44|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.15.1.38 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as the instruments. 

The result of a grade-by-grade analysis of inter-correlations between adolescence egocentrism and formal operational thoughts showed modest to non-significant differences among all the measures, which implies that there is little association between adolescent egocentrism and formal operations. Some more recent studies got similar findings. Heather et al. (1993) found that formal operations were not an effective indicator of both imaginary audience and personal fable.&lt;ref name=Heather1993&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heather, C.J. |author2=Fredda B. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Formal operation: A test of two models of adolescent egocentrism|journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence|date=1993|volume=22|pages=313–326|doi=10.1007/bf01537795}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galanaki (2012) performed a research to investigate the association of adolescent egocentrism with age, gender, pubertal development and formal operational thoughts.

===Gender differences===
A considerable amount of studies have found gender differences in egocentrism (Smetana, J.G.&amp;VillaLobos M., 2010).&lt;ref name=Maholmes&amp;Lomonaco /&gt; Kimberly A Schonert-Reichl's (1994) study on the relationship between depressive symptomatology and adolescent egocentrism recruited 62 adolescents (30 males, 32 females) aged from 12 to 17. The study used Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale (RADS),&lt;ref name=Reynolds1987&gt;{{cite book|last=W.M.|first=Reynolds|title=Reynolds adolescent depression scale: Professional manual|date=1987|publisher=Psychological Assessment Resources|location=Odessa, FL:}}&lt;/ref&gt; Imaginary Audience Scale (IAS)&lt;ref name=Elkind1979 /&gt; and the New Personal Fable Scale (NPFS)&lt;ref name=LapsleyNPFS&gt;{{cite book|last=Lapsley, D.K. |author2=Rice, K.G. |last-author-amp=yes|title=The "new look" at the imaginary audience and personal fable: Toward a general model of adolescent ego development. In D.K. Lapsley &amp; F.C. Power(eds.), Self, ego, and identity: Integrative approaches|date=1988|publisher=Springer|location=New York|pages=109–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; as measuring tools. The results revealed significantly higher scores obtained by females compared with males in the Transient Self subscale in IAS.&lt;ref name=Schonert1994&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schonert-Reichl|first=Kimberly A.|title=Gender differences in Depressive Symptomatology and Egocentrism in Adolescence|journal=The Journal of Early Adolescence|date=1994|volume=14|pages=49–65|doi=10.1177/0272431694014001004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Transient Self, as defined by Elkind and Bowen in 1979, refers to impermanent image of self that is mainly relative to one-time behaviors and temporary appearance.&lt;ref name=Elkind1979 /&gt; Thus, adolescent females have a higher tendency to consider themselves to be different from others, and tend to be more self-conscious in situations that involve momentary embarrassments (e.g. going to a party with a bad haircut), than their male peers.&lt;ref name=Schonert1994 /&gt; Another study conducted by Goossens and Beyers (1992) using similar measuring instruments found that boys have stronger beliefs that they are unique, invulnerable and sometimes omnipotent, which are typical characteristics of personal fable.&lt;ref name=Goossens1992&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goossens, L. |author2=Beyers, W. |last-author-amp=yes |title=The imaginary audience and personal fable: factor analyses and concurrent validity of the "New Look" measures|journal=Journal of Research on Adolescence|date=1992|volume=12 | issue = 2|pages=193–215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13063">The '''Advanced Distributed Learning''' ('''ADL''') '''Initiative''' is a US government program that conducts research and development on distributed learning and coordinates related efforts broadly across public and private organizations. ADL reports to the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Force Education and Training (DASD(FE&amp;T)) in the US Department of Defense (DoD). Although a DoD program, ADL serves the entire US federal government, operates a global partnership network including international defense ministries and US-based academic partners, and collaborates closely with industry and academia.  ADL advises the DoD and US government on emerging learning technologies, best practices for improving learning effectiveness and efficiency, and methods for enhancing interoperability. Notable ADL contributions to distributed learning include the [[Sharable Content Object Reference Model]] (SCORM), [[Experience API (Tin Can API)|Experience API]] (xAPI), and the DoD Instruction 1322.26.

== History ==
The ADL Initiative traces its antecedents to the early 1990s, when Congress authorized and appropriated funds for the National Guard to build prototype electronic classrooms and learning networks to increase personnel’s access to learning opportunities. By the mid-1990s, DoD realized the need for a more coordinated approach, and the ''1996 Quadrennial Defense Review''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cohen|first1=William S|title=Report of the Quadrennial Defense Review|date=May 1996|publisher=Secretary of Defense|location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt; formalized this by directing development of a Department-wide strategy for modernizing technology-based education and training. This strategy became the original ADL Initiative, and in 1998, the Deputy Secretary of Defense directed the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness (USD(P&amp;R), in collaboration with the Services, Joint Staff, Under Secretaries of Defense for Acquisition and Technology and the Comptroller), to lead ADL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Readiness (ODUSD(R)), Readiness and Training|title=Department of Defense Strategic Plan for Advanced Distributed Learning (Report to the 106th Congress)|date=April 30, 1999|url=http://prhome.defense.gov/portals/52/documents/rfm/readiness/docs/adl_stratplan.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Deputy Secretary of Defense also directed the USD(P&amp;R) to produce the Department-wide policy for advanced distributed learning, develop a corresponding “master plan” to carry out the policy, and to ensure sufficient programs and resources were available for the associated implementation (see the 1999 ADL Strategic Plan in Appendix 1 for more details).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Department of Defense Strategic Plan for Advanced Distributed Learning (Report to the 106th Congress)|date=April 30, 1999|publisher=Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Readiness (ODUSD(R)), Readiness and Training|url=http://prhome.defense.gov/portals/52/documents/rfm/readiness/docs/adl_stratplan.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1998, the DoD and other Federal agencies (e.g., the Department of Labor) had each established their own ADL projects, and the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) moved to consolidate these via the Federal Training Technology Initiative. Thus, following guidance from Congress, OSTP, and the National Partnership for Reinventing Government, the DoD ADL Initiative was grown into a Federal-wide program. Specific direction for this can be found in Section 378 of Public Law 105-261, the ''Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999|publisher=Pub. L. 105-261, 112 Stat. 1920|url=https://www.congress.gov/105/plaws/publ261/PLAW-105publ261.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; which required the Secretary of Defense to develop a strategic plan for expanding distance learning initiatives, as well as ''Executive Order 13111'' (President William J. Clinton, 12 January 1999).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=President Clinton|first1=William J|title=Executive Order 13111 (Using Technology to Improve Training Opportunities for Federal Government Employees)|date=January 12, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Executive Order, titled “Using Technology to Improve Training Opportunities for Federal Government Employees,” established a task force and advisory committee to explore how federal training programs, initiatives, and policies can better support lifelong learning through the use of learning technologies and to provide learning standards, specifications, and applications which can be sustained and extended to incorporate new technologies and learning science as they occur.

Shortly after President [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] signed ''[[Executive Order 13111]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=President Clinton|first1=William J|title=Executive Order 13111 (Using Technology to Improve Training Opportunities for Federal Government Employees)|date=January 12, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Pentagon released the ''Department of Defense Strategic Plan for Advanced Distributed Learning'' (April 30, 1999)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Readiness (ODUSD(R)), Readiness and Training|title=Department of Defense Strategic Plan for Advanced Distributed Learning (Report to the 106th Congress)|date=April 30, 1999|url=http://prhome.defense.gov/portals/52/documents/rfm/readiness/docs/adl_stratplan.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the corresponding ''Department of Defense Implementation Plan for Advanced Distributed Learning'' (May 19, 2000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Readiness (ODUSD(R)), Readiness and Training|title=Department of Defense Implementation Plan for Advanced Distributed Learning|date=May 19, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy empowers the ADL Initiative to:
* Influence the development/use of common industry standards
* Enable acquisition of interoperable tools and content
* Create a robust and dynamic network infrastructure for distribution
* Enable the modernization of supporting resources
* Engender cultural change to move from “classroom-centric” to “learner-centric”
Since its inception in the 1990s, the ADL Initiative has achieved several notable milestones, including the development of SCORM, ADL PlugFests, xAPI, and the Total Learning Architecture (TLA). More information about the history and products of ADL can be found in the ADL-sponsored book, ''Learning on Demand: ADL and the Future of e-Learning'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Advanced Distributed Learning Initiative|title=Learning on Demand: ADL and the Future of e-Learning|date=2010|publisher=Advanced Distributed Learning Initiative|location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in 2010.

== Organization ==
The ADL Initiative reports to the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Force Education and Training (DASD(FE&amp;T)), who reports to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Readiness (ASD(R)), who in turn reports to the Under Secretary for Personnel and Readiness (USD(P&amp;R)) within the Office of the Secretary of Defense.

== Subject Areas ==
ADL uses the term “distributed learning” broadly, to refer to all network-centric learning technologies and their corresponding best practices for their use. Similarly, ADL uses the term “learning” to include education, training, operational performance support, and other forms of ad hoc, just-in-time, or self-directed learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Department of Defense Strategic Plan for Advanced Distributed Learning (Report to the 106th Congress)|date=April 30, 1999|publisher=Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Readiness (ODUSD(R)), Readiness and Training|url=http://prhome.defense.gov/portals/52/documents/rfm/readiness/docs/adl_stratplan.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within these topical areas, ADL conducts research and development (Budget Area 6.3, [[Science policy of the United States#Defense research and development|Advanced Technology Development]]), facilitates coordination, and assists with the implementation of emerging science and technologies. More precisely, ADL’s work emphasizes the following six areas: [7]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Research|url=https://www.adlnet.gov/adl-research/|website=ADLnet.gov|accessdate=9 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* e-Learning (e.g., traditional web-based courseware)
* Mobile learning (m-Learning) and associated mobile performance support
* Web-based virtual worlds and simulations
* Learning analytics and performance modeling
* Associated learning theory (e.g., pedagogy, andragogy, instructional design)
* Distributed learning interoperability specifications

== SCORM ==
When ADL was established, the use of Learning Management Systems (LMSs) was increasing rapidly, but the content delivered through those systems remained separated (locked into silos).  For example, while the Navy and Army have standard courses with similar content, that content could not be shared and reused from one service to another because their LMSs would not allow it. The silo’d nature of content delivered through LMSs was not cost efficient, and became one of ADL’s first challenges to tackle resulting in the development of the SCORM (sharable content object reference model).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SCORM|url=https://www.adlnet.gov/adl-research/scorm/|website=ADLnet.gov|accessdate=9 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
SCORM, which integrates a set of related technical standards, specifications, and guidelines designed to meet high-level requirements—accessible, reusable, interoperable, and durable content and systems is arguably one of ADL’s most well known projects. SCORM content can be delivered to learners via any SCORM-conformant LMS using the same version of SCORM.  Due to the Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 1322.26,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness|title=Development, Management, and Delivery of Distributed Learning (DoD Instruction 1322.26)|date=16 June 2006|publisher=Department of Defense|location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt; SCORM is a mature technology which has been widely adopted.

== Experience API ==
In 2011, ADL recognized the need for a software specification that tracks learning experiences that occur outside of a LMS and a web browser.  As a result, ADL issued a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) asking for assistance in improving SCORM. The BAA was awarded to Rustici Software, a Nashville-based software company experienced with SCORM.
Rustici Software conducted numerous interviews with the e-learning community to determine where improvements needed to be made and developed the research version of the Experience API specification as a result.  This process was called Project Tin Can.  The moniker “Tin Can API” was derived from Project Tin Can.  When version 1.0 was officially released in April 2013, the specification was dubbed “xAPI” but by that time, some people already knew the specification by the original moniker.  
The Experience API (xAPI) allows the capture of big data on human performance, along with associated instructional content or performance context information. xAPI applies “activity streams” to tracking data and provides sub-APIs to access and store information about state and content.  This enables nearly dynamic tracking of activities from any platform or software system—from traditional LMSs to mobile devices, simulations, wearables, physical beacons, and more.

== Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 1322.26 ==
Under delegated authority, ADL stewards DoDI 1322.26, “Development, Management, and Delivery of Distributed Learning.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness|title=Development, Management, and Delivery of Distributed Learning (DoD Instruction 1322.26)|date=16 June 2006|publisher=Department of Defense|location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt; This DoDI provides guidance to support implementation of DoD Directive (DoDD) 1322.18, “Military Training.”

The '''Bachelor of Business Administration''' ('''BBA''' or '''B.B.A.''') is a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[commerce]] and [[business administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uowdubai.ac.ae/bba-degree-in-dubai/bachelor-of-business-administration|title=Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) Degree - UOWD|author=|date=|website=www.uowdubai.ac.ae}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the degree is conferred after four years of full-time study in one or more areas of business concentrations. In Europe, the degree is conferred after three years of full-time study in one or more areas of business concentrations. The BBA program usually includes general business courses and advanced courses for specific [[Academic major|concentration]]s.

==Structure==
The degree is designed to give a broad knowledge of the functional aspects of a company and their interconnection, while also allowing specialization in a particular area. B.B.A. programs thus expose students to a variety of "core subjects" and generally allow students to specialize in a specific academic area; see aside. 

The degree also develops the student's practical, managerial and communication skills, and business decision-making capability. Many programs incorporate [[training]] and practical experience, in the form of [[case study|case projects]], presentations, [[internship]]s, industrial visits, and interaction with experts from the industry. 

General educational requirements emphasize [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]] (history, economics, and literature). Coverage of mathematics is generally business related, and is often limited to "Quantitative Applications for Business" or, alternatively, courses in [[Business_mathematics#University_level|Calculus for business]] or [[Calculus 101]], and [[business statistics|business-]] or general-statistics.

===BSBA===
The B.S.B.A., '''Bachelor of Science in Business Administration''', is a quantitative variant on the BBA. General educational requirements are relatively mathematics intensive; further, the general focus may also be more analytic, often allowing additional quantitative optional coursework.

==Accreditation==
Particularly in the United States, [[undergraduate]] Business Administration programs may be [[Educational accreditation|accredited]], thus indicating that the school's educational curriculum meets specific quality standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AACSB accredited schools|url=http://www.aacsb.edu/accreditation/AccreditedMembers.asp|publisher=AACSB|access-date=2010-10-22|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6AOGQe8CN?url=http://www.aacsb.edu/accreditation/accreditedmembers.asp|archive-date=2012-09-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This page lists the '''Classifications of scholarship'''; the classifications, thesauri or maps developed to categorise scholarly research. Classifications have been created by many organisations to classify scholarly research. The kinds of activity covered by these classifications include the research itself, the outputs of the research (such as articles in learned journals) and funding for the research.

The classifications operate at different levels of detail. Some cover the whole of scholarly endeavour; some cover broad fields, such as medicine; some cover entire disciplines, such as physics; some cover a specific sub-discipline, such as high-energy physics. In total there are probably hundreds or thousands of different classifications. The classifications have found new applications in the digital era as the basis for many commercial text-mining algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Elsevier Fingerprint Engine|url=http://info.scival.com/fingerprint|website=info.scival.com|accessdate=July 13, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The classifications are the subject of ongoing inquiry and development among academics and agencies studying the system of science.&lt;ref name=ucsd&gt;{{cite web|last1=Börner|first1=Katy|last2=Klavans|first2=Richard|last3=Patek|first3=Michael|last4=Zoss|first4=Angela M.|last5=Biberstine|first5=Joseph R.|last6=Light|first6=Robert P.|last7=Larivière|first7=Vincent|last8=Boyack|first8=Kevin W.|title=Design and Update of a Classification System: The UCSD Map of Science|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0039464|website=PLOS ONE|accessdate=July 13, 2017|pages=e39464|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0039464|date=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These agencies include the [[OECD]] and the [[United States National Research Council|U.S. National Research Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Data on Federal Research and Development Investments: A Pathway to Modernization|date=2009|publisher=National Research Council|isbn=9780309145237|url=https://www.nap.edu/catalog/12772/data-on-federal-research-and-development-investments-a-pathway-to|accessdate=July 13, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A conference on science mapping standards was held in 2013 at [[Indiana University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cyberinfrastructure for Network Science (CNS) Center at Indiana University|url=http://cns.iu.edu/workshops/event/131104.html|website=cns.iu.edu|accessdate=July 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Creativity''' is a phenomenon whereby something new and somehow valuable is formed. The created item may be intangible (such as an [[idea]], a [[scientific theory]], a [[musical composition]], or a [[joke]]) or a physical object (such as an [[invention]], a [[Literature|literary work]], or a [[painting]]).

Scholarly interest in creativity is found in a number of disciplines, primarily [[psychology]], [[business studies]], and [[cognitive science]], but also [[education]], [[technology]], [[engineering]], [[philosophy]] (particularly [[philosophy of science]]), [[theology]], [[sociology]], [[linguistics]],  and [[economics]], covering  the relations between creativity and general [[intelligence]], personality type, mental and neurological processes, mental health, or [[artificial intelligence]]; the potential for fostering creativity through education and training; the fostering of creativity for national economic benefit, and the application of creative resources to improve the effectiveness of teaching and learning.

== Etymology ==
The [[lexeme]] in the English word ''creativity'' comes from the [[Latin]] term ''creō'' "to create, make": its [[Morphological derivation|derivational suffixes]] also come from Latin. The word "create" appeared in English as early as the 14th century, notably in Chaucer, to indicate divine creation&lt;ref name="RuncoAlbert"&gt;{{cite book|last=Runco|first=Mark A.|title=The Cambridge Handbook of Creativity|year=2010|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-73025-9|author2=Albert, Robert S.|editor=[[James C. Kaufman]] |editor2=Robert J. Sternberg|chapter=Creativity Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in [[The Parson's Tale]]&lt;ref&gt;"And eke Job saith, that in hell is no order of rule. And albeit that God hath '''created''' all things in right order, and nothing without order, but all things be ordered and numbered, yet nevertheless they that be damned be not in order, nor hold no order."&lt;/ref&gt;). However, its modern meaning as an act of human creation did not emerge until after [[Age of Enlightenment|the Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name=RuncoAlbert /&gt;

== Definition ==
In a summary of scientific research into creativity, Michael Mumford suggested: "Over the course of the last decade, however, we seem to have reached a general agreement that creativity involves the production of novel, useful products" (Mumford, 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;110),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mumford | first1 = M. D. | year = 2003 | title = Where have we been, where are we going? Taking stock in creativity research | url = | journal = [[Creativity Research Journal]] | volume = 15 | issue = 2–3| pages = 107–120 | doi=10.1080/10400419.2003.9651403}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, in [[Robert Sternberg]]'s words, the production of "something original and worthwhile".&lt;ref name="Sternberg Cognitive Psychology 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sternberg|first1=Robert J.|title=Cognitive Psychology|date=2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-133-38701-5|page=479|edition=6|chapter=Creativity}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authors have diverged dramatically in their precise definitions beyond these general commonalities: Peter Meusburger reckons that over a hundred different analyses can be found in the literature.&lt;ref name="Meusburger1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Meusburger|first=Peter|title=Milieus of Creativity: An Interdisciplinary Approach to Spatiality of Creativity|year=2009|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-9876-5 |editor=Meusburger, P. |editor2=Funke, J. |editor3=Wunder, E.|chapter=Milieus of Creativity: The Role of Places, Environments and Spatial Contexts}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an illustration, one definition given by [[Ellis Paul Torrance|Dr. E. Paul Torrance]] described it as "a process of becoming sensitive to problems, deficiencies, gaps in knowledge, missing elements, disharmonies, and so on; identifying the difficulty; searching for solutions, making guesses, or formulating hypotheses about the deficiencies: testing and retesting these hypotheses and possibly modifying and retesting them; and finally communicating the results."&lt;ref name="Torrance Test Manual Verbal"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Torrance|first1=Paul|title=The Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking-Norms-Technical Manual Research Edition|publisher=Personnel Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|page=6|chapter=Verbal Tests. Forms A and B-Figural Tests, Forms A and B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aspects ==
Theories of creativity (particularly investigation of why some people are more creative than others) have focused on a variety of aspects. The dominant factors are usually identified as "the four Ps" — process, product, person, and place (according to [[James Melvin Rhodes|Mel Rhodes]]).&lt;ref&gt;Mel Rhodes: [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/20342603?uid=3737864&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21103750220081''An Analysis of Creativity.''] in Phi Delta Kappan 1961, Vol. 42,  No. 7, p. 306–307&lt;/ref&gt; A focus on ''process'' is shown in cognitive approaches that try to describe thought mechanisms and techniques for creative thinking. Theories invoking divergent rather than convergent thinking (such as [[J. P. Guilford|Guilford]]), or those describing the staging of the creative process (such as [[Graham Wallas|Wallas]]) are primarily theories of creative process. A focus on creative ''product'' usually appears in attempts to measure creativity (psychometrics, see below) and in creative ideas framed as successful [[memetics|memes]].&lt;ref name="Gabora"&gt;{{cite journal|last=[[Liane Gabora|Gabora, Liane]]|year=1997|title= The Origin and Evolution of Culture and Creativity|journal=Journal of Memetics – Evolutionary Models of Information Transmission|volume=1|url=http://cogprints.org/794/1/oecc.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychometric approach to creativity reveals that it also involves the ability to produce more.&lt;ref name="Sternberg 2009 468"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sternberg|first=Robert J.|title=Cognitive Psychology|year=2009|publisher=CENGAGE Learning|isbn=978-0-495-50629-4|page=468|editor=Jaime A. Perkins |editor2=Dan Moneypenny |editor3=Wilson Co}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A focus on the nature of the creative ''person'' considers more general intellectual habits, such as openness, levels of [[Ideation (creative process)|ideation]], autonomy, expertise, exploratory behavior, and so on. A focus on ''place'' considers the circumstances in which creativity flourishes, such as degrees of autonomy, access to resources, and the nature of gatekeepers. Creative lifestyles are characterized by nonconforming attitudes and behaviors as well as flexibility.&lt;ref name="Sternberg 2009 468" /&gt;

== History of the concept ==
{{Main|History of the concept of creativity}}
[[File:Plato-raphael.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Greek philosophers like Plato rejected the concept of creativity, preferring to see art as a form of discovery. Asked in ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', "Will we say, of a painter, that he makes something?", Plato answers, "Certainly not, he merely [[mimesis|imitates]]."&lt;ref name="Six Ideas p. 244"&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], ''A History of Six Ideas: an Essay in Aesthetics'', p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

=== Ancient views ===
Most ancient cultures, including thinkers of [[Ancient Greece]],&lt;ref name="Six Ideas p. 244" /&gt; [[History of China#Ancient China|Ancient China]], and [[Outline of ancient India|Ancient India]],&lt;ref name="Albert99"&gt;{{cite book|last=Albert|first= R. S.|author2=Runco, M. A.|year=1999|editor = Sternberg, R. J.|title= Handbook of Creativity|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]|chapter=:A History of Research on Creativity}}&lt;/ref&gt; lacked the concept of creativity, seeing art as a form of discovery and not creation. The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] had no terms corresponding to "to create" or "creator" except for the expression "''poiein''" ("to make"), which only applied to ''poiesis'' (poetry) and to the ''poietes'' (poet, or "maker") who made it. [[Plato]] did not believe in art as a form of creation. Asked in ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Plato, The Republic, Book X – [[wikisource:The Republic/Book X]]&lt;/ref&gt; "Will we say, of a painter, that he makes something?", he answers, "Certainly not, he merely [[mimesis|imitates]]."&lt;ref name="Six Ideas p. 244" /&gt;

It is commonly argued that the notion of "creativity" originated in [[Western culture]] through [[Christianity]], as a matter of [[Revelation|divine inspiration]].&lt;ref name="RuncoAlbert" /&gt; According to the historian [[Daniel J. Boorstin]], "the early Western conception of creativity was the [[Genesis creation narrative|Biblical story of creation]] given in the ''[[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]''."&lt;ref name="Albert2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Albert|first= R. S.|author2=Runco, M. A.|year=1999|editor = Sternberg, R. J.|title= Handbook of Creativity|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]|chapter=:A History of Research on Creativity|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is not creativity in the modern sense, which did not arise until the [[Renaissance]]. In the Judaeo-Christian tradition, creativity was the sole province of God; humans were not considered to have the ability to create something new except as an expression of God's work.&lt;ref name="NiuSternberg"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/h0091265|last=Niu|first=Weihua|author2=Sternberg, Robert J.|title=The Philosophical Roots of Western and Eastern Conceptions of Creativity|journal=Journal of Theoretical and Philosophical Psychology|year=2006|volume=26|pages=18–38|url=http://www.westga.edu/~stpp/JTPP_Aticles/26-2/THE1210.pdf|accessdate=23 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/641OBVx0d?url=http://www.westga.edu/~stpp/JTPP_Aticles/26-2/THE1210.pdf|archivedate=18 December 2011|df=}}; cf. [[Michel Weber]], "[https://www.academia.edu/3640181/_Creativity_Efficacy_and_Vision_Ethics_and_Psychology_in_an_Open_Universe_2006_ Creativity, Efficacy and Vision: Ethics and Psychology in an Open Universe]," in Michel Weber and Pierfrancesco Basile (eds.), ''Subjectivity, Process, and Rationality'', Frankfurt/Lancaster, ontos verlag, Process Thought XIV, 2006, pp. 263-281.&lt;/ref&gt; A concept similar to that of Christianity existed in Greek culture, for instance, [[Muse]]s were seen as mediating inspiration from the Gods.&lt;ref name="Dacey"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dacey|first=John|title=Encyclopedia of Creativity, Vol. 1|year=1999|isbn=978-0-12-227076-5|editor=Mark A. Runco |editor2=Steven R. Pritzer|chapter=Concepts of Creativity: A history|publisher=[[Elsevier]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Romans and Greeks invoked the concept of an external creative "[[daemon (classical mythology)|daemon]]" (Greek) or "[[Genius (mythology)|genius]]" (Latin), linked to the sacred or the divine. However, none of these views are similar to the modern concept of creativity, and the individual was not seen as the cause of creation until the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref name="Albert3"&gt;{{cite book|last=Albert|first= R. S.|author2=Runco, M. A.|year=1999|editor = Sternberg, R. J.|title= Handbook of Creativity|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]|chapter=:A History of Research on Creativity|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during the Renaissance that creativity was first seen, not as a conduit for the divine, but from the abilities of "[[Great Man theory|great men]]".&lt;ref name="Albert3" /&gt;

=== The Enlightenment and after ===
The rejection of creativity in favor of discovery and the belief that individual creation was a conduit of the divine would dominate the West probably until the [[Renaissance]] and even later.&lt;ref name="NiuSternberg" /&gt; The development of the modern concept of creativity begins in the [[Renaissance]], when creation began to be perceived as having originated from the abilities of the individual, and not God. This could be attributed to the leading intellectual movement of the time, aptly named [[humanism]], which developed an intensely human-centric outlook on the world, valuing the intellect and achievement of the individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Humanism - Rome Reborn: The Vatican Library &amp; Renaissance Culture {{!}} Exhibitions - Library of Congress|url = https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/vatican/humanism.html|website = www.loc.gov|date = 1993-01-08|accessdate = 2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this philosophy arose the [[Renaissance man]] (or polymath), an individual who embodies the principals of humanism in their ceaseless courtship with knowledge and creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Leonardo da Vinci {{!}} Italian artist, engineer, and scientist|url = http://www.britannica.com/biography/Leonardo-da-Vinci|website = Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate = 2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most well-known and immensely accomplished examples is [[Leonardo da Vinci]].

However, this shift was gradual and would not become immediately apparent until the Enlightenment.&lt;ref name="Albert3" /&gt; By the 18th century and the [[Age of Enlightenment]], mention of creativity (notably in [[aesthetics]]), linked with the concept of [[imagination]], became more frequent.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz80"&gt;{{cite book |author=Tatarkiewicz, Władysław |authorlink=Władysław Tatarkiewicz |title=A History of Six Ideas: an Essay in Aesthetics |location=Translated from the Polish by [[Christopher Kasparek]], The Hague |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff |year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the writing of [[Thomas Hobbes]], imagination became a key element of human cognition;&lt;ref name="RuncoAlbert" /&gt; [[William Duff (writer)|William Duff]] was one of the first to identify imagination as a quality of [[genius]], typifying the separation being made between talent (productive, but breaking no new ground) and genius.&lt;ref name="Dacey" /&gt;

As a direct and independent topic of study, creativity effectively received no attention until the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Dacey" /&gt; Runco and Albert argue that creativity as the subject of proper study began seriously to emerge in the late 19th century with the increased interest in individual differences inspired by the arrival of [[Darwinism]]. In particular, they refer to the work of [[Francis Galton]], who through his [[Eugenics|eugenicist]] outlook took a keen interest in the heritability of intelligence, with creativity taken as an aspect of genius.&lt;ref name="RuncoAlbert" /&gt;

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, leading mathematicians and scientists such as [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] (1896) and [[Henri Poincaré]] (1908) began to reflect on and publicly discuss their creative processes.

=== Twentieth century to the present day ===
The insights of Poincaré and von Helmholtz were built on in early accounts of the creative process by pioneering theorists such as [[Graham Wallas]]&lt;ref name="Wallas26"&gt;{{cite book |author=Wallas, G. |title=Art of Thought |year=1926 |authorlink=Graham Wallas}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Max Wertheimer]]. In his work ''Art of Thought'', published in 1926, Wallas presented one of the first models of the creative process. In the Wallas stage model, creative insights and illuminations may be explained by a process consisting of 5 stages:
:(i) ''preparation'' (preparatory work on a problem that focuses the individual's mind on the problem and explores the problem's dimensions),
:(ii) ''incubation'' (where the problem is internalized into the unconscious mind and nothing appears externally to be happening),
:(iii) ''intimation'' (the creative person gets a "feeling" that a solution is on its way),
:(iv) ''illumination'' or insight (where the creative idea bursts forth from its [[preconscious]] processing into conscious awareness);
:(v) ''verification'' (where the idea is consciously verified, elaborated, and then applied).
Wallas' model is often treated as four stages, with "intimation" seen as a sub-stage.

Wallas considered creativity to be a legacy of the [[evolution]]ary process, which allowed humans to quickly adapt to rapidly changing environments. Simonton&lt;ref name="Simonton99"&gt;{{cite book |author=Simonton, D. K. |year=1999 |title=Origins of genius: Darwinian perspectives on creativity |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides an updated perspective on this view in his book, ''Origins of genius: Darwinian perspectives on creativity''.

In 1927, [[Alfred North Whitehead]] gave the Gifford Lectures at the University of Edinburgh, later published as ''[[Process and Reality]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Whitehead|first=Alfred North|title=Process and reality : an essay in cosmology ; Gifford Lectures delivered in the University of Edinburgh during the session 1927–28|year=1978|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-02-934580-1|edition=Corrected}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is credited with having coined the term "creativity" to serve as the ultimate category of his metaphysical scheme: "Whitehead actually coined the term – our term, still the preferred currency of exchange among literature, science, and the arts. . . a term that quickly became so popular, so omnipresent, that its invention within living memory, and by Alfred North Whitehead of all people, quickly became occluded".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Steven|title=Introduction: Whitehead Now|journal=Configurations|year=2005|volume=1|issue=13|pages=1–33}}. Cf. [[Michel Weber]] and Will Desmond (eds.). ''[https://www.academia.edu/279955/Handbook_of_Whiteheadian_Process_Thought Handbook of Whiteheadian Process Thought]'' (Frankfurt / Lancaster, Ontos Verlag, Process Thought X1 &amp; X2, 2008) and Ronny Desmet &amp; Michel Weber (edited by), ''[https://www.academia.edu/279940/Whitehead._The_Algebra_of_Metaphysics Whitehead. The Algebra of Metaphysics. Applied Process Metaphysics Summer Institute Memorandum]'', Louvain-la-Neuve, Les Éditions Chromatika, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The formal [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] measurement of creativity, from the standpoint of orthodox [[Psychology|psychological]] literature, is usually considered to have begun with [[J. P. Guilford]]'s 1950 address to the [[American Psychological Association]], which helped popularize the topic&lt;ref name="Sternberg99"&gt;{{cite book |author=Sternberg, R. J. |author2=Lubart, T. I. |chapter=The Concept of Creativity: Prospects and Paradigms |editor=Sternberg, R. J. |title=Handbook of Creativity |year=1999 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |authorlink=Robert Sternberg |isbn=978-0-521-57285-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and focus attention on a scientific approach to conceptualizing creativity. (It should be noted that the London School of Psychology had instigated psychometric studies of creativity as early as 1927 with the work of H. L. Hargreaves into the Faculty of Imagination,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hargreaves | first1 = H. L. | year = 1927 | title = The faculty of imagination: An enquiry concerning the existence of a general faculty, or group factor, of imagination | url = | journal = British Journal of Psychology | volume = Monograph Supplement 3 | issue = | pages = 1–74 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it did not have the same impact.) Statistical analysis led to the recognition of creativity (as measured) as a separate aspect of human cognition to [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]]-type intelligence, into which it had previously been subsumed. Guilford's work suggested that above a threshold level of IQ, the relationship between creativity and classically measured intelligence broke down.&lt;ref name="Kozbelt"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kozbelt|first=Aaron|title=The Cambridge Handbook of Creativity|year=2010|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-73025-9 |author2=Beghetto, Ronald A. |author3=Runco, Mark A.|editor=[[James C. Kaufman]] |editor2=Robert J. Sternberg|chapter=Theories of Creativity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Four C" model ===
[[James C. Kaufman]] and Beghetto introduced a "four C" model of creativity; ''mini-c'' ("transformative learning" involving "personally meaningful interpretations of experiences, actions, and insights"), ''little-c'' (everyday problem solving and creative expression), ''Pro-C'' (exhibited by people who are professionally or vocationally creative though not necessarily eminent) and ''Big-C'' (creativity considered great in the given field). This model was intended to help accommodate models and theories of creativity that stressed competence as an essential component and the historical transformation of a creative domain as the highest mark of creativity. It also, the authors argued, made a useful framework for analyzing creative processes in individuals.&lt;ref name="KaufBeg2009"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/a0013688|last=Kaufman|first=James C.|author2=Beghetto, Ronald A.|title=Beyond Big and Little: The Four C Model of Creativity|journal=[[Review of General Psychology]]|year=2009|volume=13|issue=1|pages=1–12|authorlink=James C.

The contrast of terms "Big C" and "Little c" has been widely used. Kozbelt, Beghetto and Runco use a little-c/Big-C model to review major theories of creativity.&lt;ref name=Kozbelt /&gt; [[Margaret Boden]] distinguishes between h-creativity (historical) and p-creativity (personal).&lt;ref name="Boden2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boden|first=Margaret|title=The Creative Mind: Myths And Mechanisms|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-297-82069-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simonton has analysed the career trajectories of eminent creative people in order to map patterns and predictors of creative productivity.&lt;ref name="Simonton97"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.104.1.66|last=Simonton|first=D. K.|title=Creative Productivity: A Predictive and Explanatory Model of Career Trajectories and Landmarks|journal=Psychological Review|year=1997|volume=104|issue=1|pages=66–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theories of creative processes ==
There has been much empirical study in [[psychology]] and [[cognitive science]] of the processes through which creativity occurs. Interpretation of the results of these studies has led to several possible explanations of the sources and methods of creativity.

=== Incubation ===
Incubation is a temporary break from [[creative problem solving]] that can result in insight.&lt;ref name="EoC Incubation"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=S. M.|title=Encyclopedia of Creativity Volume I|year=2011|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-375039-6|pages=653–657|edition=2nd|editor=M. A. Runco |editor2=S. R. Pritzker|chapter=Incubation}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been some empirical research looking at whether, as the concept of "incubation" in [[Graham Wallas|Wallas]]' model implies, a period of interruption or rest from a problem may aid creative problem-solving. Ward&lt;ref name="Ward2003"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ward, T. |year=2003 |chapter=Creativity |editor= Nagel, L. |title=Encyclopaedia of Cognition |location=New York |publisher=Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt; lists various hypotheses that have been advanced to explain why incubation may aid creative problem-solving, and notes how some [[empirical evidence]] is consistent with the hypothesis that incubation aids creative problem-solving in that it enables "forgetting" of misleading clues. Absence of incubation may lead the problem solver to become [[fixation (psychology)|fixated]] on inappropriate strategies of solving the problem.&lt;ref name="Smith1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Steven M.|title=The Creative Cognition Approach|year=1995|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|editor=Steven M. Smith |editor2=Thomas B. Ward |editor3=Ronald A. Finke|chapter=Fixation, Incubation, and Insight in Memory and Creative Thinking}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work disputes the earlier hypothesis that creative solutions to problems arise mysteriously from the unconscious mind while the conscious mind is occupied on other tasks.&lt;ref name=Anderson2000&gt;"{{cite book |author=Anderson, J. R. |year=2000 |title=Cognitive psychology and its implications |publisher=Worth Publishers |isbn=978-0-7167-1686-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
This earlier hypothesis is discussed in [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi|Csikszentmihalyi]]'s five phase model of the creative process which describes incubation as a time that your unconscious takes over. This allows for unique connections to be made without your consciousness trying to make logical order out of the problem.&lt;ref&gt;Csikszentmihalyi, Mihaly (1996). ''Creativity : Flow and the Psychology of Discovery and Invention.'' New York: Harper Perennial. {{ISBN|0-06-092820-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Convergent and divergent thinking ===
[[J. P. Guilford]]&lt;ref name="Guilford67"&gt;{{cite book |author=Guilford, J. P. |year=1967 |title=The Nature of Human Intelligence |authorlink=J. P. Guilford}}&lt;/ref&gt; drew a distinction between convergent and divergent production (commonly renamed [[convergent thinking|convergent]] and [[divergent thinking]]). Convergent thinking involves aiming for a single, correct solution to a problem, whereas divergent thinking involves creative generation of multiple answers to a set problem. Divergent thinking is sometimes used as a synonym for creativity in psychology literature. Other researchers have occasionally used the terms ''flexible'' thinking or [[fluid and crystallized intelligence|fluid intelligence]], which are roughly similar to (but not synonymous with) creativity.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

=== Creative cognition approach ===
In 1992, Finke et al. proposed the "Geneplore" model, in which creativity takes place in two phases: a generative phase, where an individual constructs mental representations called preinventive structures, and an exploratory phase where those structures are used to come up with creative ideas. Some evidence shows that when people use their imagination to develop new ideas, those ideas are heavily structured in predictable ways by the properties of existing categories and concepts.&lt;ref name="Ward1995"&gt;Ward, T.B. (1995). What’s old about new ideas. In S. M. Smith, T. B. Ward &amp; R. A. &amp; Finke (Eds.) ''The creative cognition approach'', 157–178, London: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Weisberg&lt;ref name="Weisberg93"&gt;{{cite book |author=Weisberg, R. W. |year=1993 |title=Creativity: Beyond the myth of genius |publisher=Freeman |isbn=978-0-7167-2119-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued, by contrast, that creativity only involves ordinary cognitive processes yielding extraordinary results.

=== The Explicit–Implicit Interaction (EII) theory ===
Helie and Sun&lt;ref name="HelieSun2010"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Helie S. |author2=Sun R. | year = 2010 | title = Incubation, insight, and creative problem solving: A unified theory and a connectionist model | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 117 | issue = 3| pages = 994–1024 | doi=10.1037/a0019532 | pmid=20658861|citeseerx=10.1.1.405.2245 }}&lt;/ref&gt; recently proposed a unified framework for understanding [[creative problem-solving|creativity in problem solving]], namely the Explicit–Implicit Interaction (EII) theory of creativity. This new theory constitutes an attempt at providing a more unified explanation of relevant phenomena (in part by reinterpreting/integrating various fragmentary existing theories of [[Incubation (psychology)|incubation]] and [[insight]]).

The EII theory relies mainly on five basic principles, namely:
# The co-existence of and the difference between explicit and implicit knowledge; 
# The simultaneous involvement of implicit and explicit processes in most tasks; 
# The redundant representation of explicit and implicit knowledge; 
# The integration of the results of explicit and implicit processing;
# The iterative (and possibly bidirectional) processing. 
A computational implementation of the theory was developed based on the [[CLARION (cognitive architecture)|CLARION cognitive architecture]] and used to simulate relevant human data. This work represents an initial step in the development of process-based theories of creativity encompassing incubation, insight, and various other related phenomena.

=== Conceptual blending ===
{{Main|Conceptual blending}}
In ''[[The Act of Creation]]'', [[Arthur Koestler]] introduced the concept of ''bisociation'' — that creativity arises as a result of the intersection of two quite different frames of reference.&lt;ref name="Koestler64"&gt;{{cite book |author=Koestler, A. |title=The Act of Creation |year=1964 |authorlink=Arthur Koestler |isbn=978-0-330-73116-4 |publisher=Pan Books |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea was later developed into conceptual blending. In the 1990s, various approaches in cognitive science that dealt with [[metaphor]], [[analogy]], and [[structure mapping]] have been converging, and a new integrative approach to the study of creativity in science, art and humor has emerged under the label [[conceptual blending]].

=== Honing theory ===
Honing theory, developed principally by psychologist [[Liane Gabora]], posits that creativity arises due to the self-organizing, self-mending nature of a worldview. The creative process is a way in which the individual hones (and re-hones) an integrated worldview. Honing theory places emphasis not only on the externally visible creative outcome but also the internal cognitive restructuring and repair of the worldview brought about by the creative process. When faced with a creatively demanding task, there is an interaction between the conception of the task and the worldview. The conception of the task changes through interaction with the worldview, and the worldview changes through interaction with the task. This interaction is reiterated until the task is complete, at which point not only is the task conceived of differently, but the worldview is subtly or drastically transformed as it follows the natural tendency of a worldview to attempt to resolve dissonance and seek internal consistency amongst its components, whether they be ideas, attitudes, or bits of knowledge.

A central feature of honing theory is the notion of a potentiality state.&lt;ref&gt;Gabora, L. &amp; Saab, A. (2011). Creative interference and states of potentiality in analogy problem solving. ''Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society''. July 20–23, 2011, Boston MA.&lt;/ref&gt; Honing theory posits that creative thought proceeds not by searching through and randomly ‘mutating’ predefined possibilities, but by drawing upon associations that exist due to overlap in the distributed neural cell assemblies that participate in the encoding of experiences in memory. Midway through the creative process one may have made associations between the current task and previous experiences, but not yet disambiguated which aspects of those previous experiences are relevant to the current task. Thus the creative idea may feel ‘half-baked’. It is at that point that it can be said to be in a potentiality state, because how it will actualize depends on the different internally or externally generated contexts it interacts with.

Honing theory is held to explain certain phenomena not dealt with by other theories of creativity, for example, how different works by the same creator are observed in studies to exhibit a recognizable style or 'voice' even through in different creative outlets. This is not predicted by theories of creativity that emphasize chance processes or the accumulation of expertise, but it is predicted by honing theory, according to which personal style reflects the creator's uniquely structured worldview. Another example is in the environmental stimulus for creativity. Creativity is commonly considered to be fostered by a supportive, nurturing, trustworthy environment conducive to self-actualization. However, research shows that creativity is also associated with childhood adversity, which would stimulate honing.

=== Everyday imaginative thought ===
In everyday thought, people often spontaneously imagine alternatives to reality when they think "if only...".&lt;ref&gt;Roese, N. J. &amp; Olson, J. M. (1995). ''What Might Have Been: The Social Psychology of Counterfactual Thinking''. Mahwah, New Jersey: Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt; Their [[counterfactual thinking]] is viewed as an example of everyday creative processes.&lt;ref&gt;Markman, K. Klein, W. &amp; Suhr, E. (eds) (2009). ''Handbook of mental simulation and the human imagination.'' Hove, Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proposed that the creation of counterfactual alternatives to reality depends on similar cognitive processes to rational thought.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ruth M. J. Byrne|Byrne, R. M. J.]] (2005). The Rational Imagination: How People Create Counterfactual Alternatives to Reality. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assessing individual creative ability ==
=== Creativity quotient ===
There was a ''creativity quotient'' developed similar to the [[intelligence quotient]] (IQ). It makes use of the results of divergent thinking tests (see below) by processing them further. It gives more weight to ideas that are radically different from other ideas in the response.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Snyder|first=Allan|date=2004|title=The creativity quotient: An objective scoring of ideational fluency|journal=Creativity Research Journal|volume=16|issue=4|pages=415–419|doi=10.1080/10400410409534552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychometric approach ===
[[J. P. Guilford]]'s group,&lt;ref name="Guilford67" /&gt; which pioneered the modern [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] study of creativity, constructed several tests to measure creativity in 1967:
* Plot Titles, where participants are given the plot of a story and asked to write original titles.
* Quick Responses is a word-association test scored for uncommonness.
* Figure Concepts, where participants were given simple drawings of objects and individuals and asked to find qualities or features that are common by two or more drawings; these were scored for uncommonness.
* Unusual Uses is finding unusual uses for common everyday objects such as bricks.
* Remote Associations, where participants are asked to find a word between two given words (e.g. Hand _____ Call)
* Remote Consequences, where participants are asked to generate a list of consequences of unexpected events (e.g. loss of gravity)

Building on Guilford's work, [[Ellis Paul Torrance|Torrance]]&lt;ref&gt;(Torrance, 1974)&lt;/ref&gt; developed the [[Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://people.uncw.edu/caropresoe/GiftedFoundations/SocialEmotional/Creativity-articles/Kim_Can-we-trust-creativity-tests.pdf|title=Can We Trust Creativity Tests?|author=Kim, Kyung Hee|year=2006|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|volume=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; They involved simple tests of divergent thinking and other problem-solving skills, which were scored on:
* '''Fluency''' – The total number of interpretable, meaningful, and relevant ideas generated in response to the stimulus.
* '''Originality''' – The statistical rarity of the responses among the test subjects.
* '''Elaboration''' – The amount of detail in the responses.

Such tests, sometimes called ''Divergent Thinking (DT)'' tests have been both supported&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kim | first1 = K.

Considerable progress has been made in automated scoring of [[divergent thinking]] tests using semantic approach. When compared to human raters, [[Natural language processing|NLP]] techniques were shown to be reliable and valid in scoring the originality.&lt;ref&gt;Forster, E. A., &amp; Dunbar, K. N. (2009). Creativity evaluation through latent semantic analysis. In Proceedings of the 31st Annual meeting of the Cognitive Science Society (pp. 602–607).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harbison, I. J., &amp; Haarmann, H. (2014). Automated scoring of originality using semantic representations. In Proceedings of the 36th Annual meeting of the Cognitive Science Society (poster paper).&lt;/ref&gt; The reported computer programs were able to achieve a correlation of 0.60 and 0.72 respectively to human graders.

Semantic networks were also used to devise originality scores that yielded significant correlations with socio-personal measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Acar | first1 = S. | last2 = Runco | first2 = M.

Runco&lt;ref&gt;Other members include Kenes Beketayev PhD Computer Science; Liberty Lidz, PhD Linguistics; Perman Gochyyev, PhD Statistics&lt;/ref&gt; combined expertise in creativity research, natural language processing, computational linguistics, and statistical data analysis to devise a scalable system for computerized automated testing (SparcIt Creativity Index Testing system).

=== Social-personality approach ===
Some researchers have taken a social-personality approach to the measurement of creativity. In these studies, personality traits such as independence of judgement, self-confidence, attraction to complexity, aesthetic orientation, and risk-taking are used as measures of the creativity of individuals.&lt;ref name="Sternberg99" /&gt; A [[meta-analysis]] by Gregory Feist showed that creative people tend to be "more open to new experiences, less conventional and less conscientious, more self-confident, self-accepting, driven, ambitious, dominant, hostile, and impulsive." Openness, conscientiousness, self-acceptance, hostility, and impulsivity had the strongest effects of the traits listed.&lt;ref name=Feist /&gt; Within the framework of the [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five]] model of personality, some consistent traits have emerged.&lt;ref name="Batey, M. 2006 p. 355-429"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Batey | first1 = M. | last2 = Furnham | first2 = A. | year = 2006 | title = Creativity, intelligence and personality: A critical review of the scattered literature | url = | journal = Genetic, Social, and General Psychology Monographs | volume = 132 | issue = 4| pages = 355–429 | doi=10.3200/mono.132.4.355-430}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Openness to experience]] has been shown to be consistently related to a whole host of different assessments of creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Batey | first1 = M. | last2 = Furnham | first2 = A. F. | last3 = Safiullina | first3 = X. | year = 2010 | title = Intelligence, General Knowledge and Personality as Predictors of Creativity | url = | journal = Learning and Individual Differences | volume = 20 | issue = 5| pages = 532–535 | doi=10.1016/j.lindif.2010.04.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the other Big Five traits, research has demonstrated subtle differences between different domains of creativity. Compared to non-artists, artists tend to have higher levels of openness to experience and lower levels of conscientiousness, while scientists are more open to experience, [[Conscientiousness|conscientious]], and higher in the confidence-dominance facets of extraversion compared to non-scientists.&lt;ref name=Feist&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Feist | first1 = G. J. | year = 1998 | title = A meta-analysis of the impact of personality on scientific and artistic creativity | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychological Review | volume = 2 | issue = 4| pages = 290–309 | doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr0204_5| pmid = 15647135 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self-report questionnaires ===
An alternative are biographical methods. These methods use quantitative characteristics such as the number of publications, patents, or performances of a work. While this method was originally developed for highly creative personalities, today it is also available as [[Self-report study#Questionnaires and interviews|self-report questionnaires]] supplemented with frequent, less outstanding creative behaviors such as writing a short story or creating your own recipes. For example, the [[Creativity Achievement Questionnaire|Creative Achievement Questionnaire]], a self-report test that measures creative achievement across 10 domains, was described in 2005 and shown to be reliable and valid when compared to other measures of creativity and to independent evaluation of creative output.&lt;ref&gt;(Carson, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the English original, it was also used in a Chinese,&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ying-Yao|first=Wang, Chia-Chi{{!}}Ho, Hsiao-Chi{{!}}Cheng, Chih-Ling{{!}}Cheng|date=2014-00-00|title=Application of the Rasch Model to the Measurement of Creativity: The Creative Achievement Questionnaire.|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1088863|journal=Creativity Research Journal|language=en|volume=26|issue=1|issn=1040-0419}}&lt;/ref&gt; French,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bendetowicz|first=David|last2=Urbanski|first2=Marika|last3=Aichelburg|first3=Clarisse|last4=Levy|first4=Richard|last5=Volle|first5=Emmanuelle|date=2017-01|title=Brain morphometry predicts individual creative potential and the ability to combine remote ideas|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0010945216303161|journal=Cortex|volume=86|pages=216–229|doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2016.10.021|pmid=27919546|issn=0010-9452}}&lt;/ref&gt; and German-speaking&lt;ref name="Form 440–450"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Form|first=Sven|last2=Schlichting|first2=Kerrin|last3=Kaernbach|first3=Christian|date=2017-11|title=Mentoring functions: Interpersonal tensions are associated with mentees' creative achievement.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|language=en|volume=11|issue=4|pages=440–450|doi=10.1037/aca0000103|issn=1931-390X}}&lt;/ref&gt; version. It is the self-report questionnaire most frequently used in research.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Creativity and intelligence ==
The potential relationship between creativity and [[intelligence]] has been of interest since the late 1900s, when a multitude of influential studies – from Getzels &amp; Jackson,&lt;ref name="Getzels, J. W. 1962"&gt;Getzels, J. W., &amp; Jackson, P. W. (1962). Creativity and intelligence: Explorations with gifted students. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Barron,&lt;ref name="Barron, F. 1963"&gt;Barron, F. (1963). Creativity and psychological health. Princeton: D. Van Nostrand Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallach &amp; Kogan,&lt;ref name="Wallach, M. A. 1965"&gt;Wallach, M. A., &amp; Kogan, N. (1965). Modes of thinking in young children: A study of the creativity-intelligence distinction. New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston.&lt;/ref&gt; and Guilford&lt;ref name="Guilford, J. P. 1967"&gt;Guilford, J. P. (1967). The nature of human intelligence. New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; – focused not only on creativity, but also on intelligence. This joint focus highlights both the theoretical and practical importance of the relationship: researchers are interested not only if the constructs are related, but also how and why.&lt;ref&gt;Plucker, J., &amp; Renzulli, J. S. (1999). Psychometric approaches to the study of human creativity. In R. J. Sternberg (Ed.), Handbook of creativity (pp. 35–60). New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are multiple theories accounting for their relationship, with the 3 main theories as follows:

*Threshold Theory – Intelligence is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for creativity. There is a moderate positive relationship between creativity and intelligence until IQ ~120.&lt;ref name="Barron, F. 1963" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guilford, J. P. 1967" /&gt;
*Certification Theory – Creativity is not intrinsically related to intelligence. Instead, individuals are required to meet the requisite level intelligence in order to gain a certain level of education/work, which then in turn offers the opportunity to be creative. Displays of creativity are moderated by intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, J. R. (1989). Cognitive processes in creativity. In J. A. Glover, R. R. Ronning, &amp; C. R. Reynolds (Eds.), Handbook of creativity (pp. 135–145). New York: Plenum.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Interference Theory – Extremely high intelligence might interfere with creative ability.&lt;ref name="Sternberg, R. J. 1996"&gt;Sternberg, R. J. (1996). Successful Intelligence. NewYork: Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sternberg and O’Hara&lt;ref name="Sternberg, R. J. 1999 pp. 251"&gt;Sternberg, R. J., &amp; O’Hara, L. A. (1999). Creativity and intelligence. In R. J. Sternberg (Ed.), Handbook of creativity (pp. 251–272). Cambridge, MA: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a framework of 5 possible relationships between creativity and intelligence:
#Creativity is a subset of intelligence
#Intelligence is a subset of creativity
#Creativity and intelligence are overlapping constructs
#Creativity and intelligence are part of the same construct (coincident sets)
#Creativity and intelligence are distinct constructs (disjoint sets)

=== Creativity as a subset of intelligence ===
A number of researchers include creativity, either explicitly or implicitly, as a key component of intelligence.

''Examples of theories that include creativity as a subset of intelligence''

*Gardner’s  [[Theory of multiple intelligences]] (MIT)&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, H. (1993). Creating minds. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; – implicitly includes creativity as a subset of MIT. To demonstrate this, Gardner cited examples of different famous creators, each of whom differed in their types of intelligences e.g. Picasso (spatial intelligence); Freud (intrapersonal); Einstein (logical-mathematical); and Gandhi (interpersonal).
*Sternberg’s Theory of Successful intelligence&lt;ref name="Sternberg, R. J. 1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sternberg, R. J. 1999 pp. 251" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sternberg, R. J., Kaufman, J. C., &amp; Grigorenko, E. L. (2008). Applied intelligence. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Triarchic theory of intelligence]]) includes creativity as a main component, and comprises 3 sub-theories: Componential (Analytic), Contextual (Practical), and Experiential (Creative). Experiential sub-theory – the ability to use pre-existing knowledge and skills to solve new and novel problems – is directly related to creativity.
*The [[Cattell–Horn–Carroll theory]] includes creativity as a subset of intelligence. Specifically, it is associated with the broad group factor of long-term storage and retrieval (Glr). Glr narrow abilities relating to creativity include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kaufman | first1 = J. C. | last2 = Kaufman | first2 = S. B. | last3 = Lichtenberger | first3 = E.

New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; extended the CHC-theory in the sense that it was proposed that those individuals who are creative are also selective in their processing speed Martindale argues that in the creative process, larger amounts of information are processed more slowly in the early stages, and as the individual begins to understand the problem, the processing speed is increased.
*The Dual Process Theory of Intelligence&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, J.C., Kaufman, S.B., &amp; Plucker, J.A. (2013). Contemporary theories of intelligence. In J. Reisberg (Ed.), The Oxford Handbook of Cognitive Psychology (pp. 811-822). New York, NY: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; posits a two-factor/type model of intelligence. Type 1 is a conscious process, and concerns goal directed thoughts, which are explained by ''g''. Type 2 is an unconscious process, and concerns spontaneous cognition, which encompasses daydreaming and implicit learning ability. Kaufman argues that creativity occurs as a result of Type 1 and Type 2 processes working together in combination. The use of each type in the creative process can be used to varying degrees.

=== Intelligence as a subset of creativity ===
In this relationship model, intelligence is a key component in the development of creativity.

*Sternberg &amp; Lubart’s Investment Theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sternberg | first1 = R. J. | last2 = Lubart | first2 = T. I. | year = 1991 | title = An investment theory of creativity and its development | url = | journal = Human Development | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 1–32 | doi=10.1159/000277029}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sternberg | first1 = R.

Like under/low-valued stock, creative individuals generate unique ideas that are initially rejected by other people. The creative individual has to persevere, and convince the others of the ideas value. After convincing the others, and thus increasing the ideas value, the creative individual ‘sells high’ by leaving the idea with the other people, and moves onto generating another idea. According to this theory, six distinct, but related elements contribute to successful creativity: intelligence, knowledge, thinking styles, personality, motivation, and environment. Intelligence is just one of the six factors that can either solely, or in conjunction with the other five factors, generate creative thoughts.
*Amabile’s Componential Model of Creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Amabile | first1 = T. M. | year = 1982 | title = Social psychology of creativity: A consensual assessment technique | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 43 | issue = 5| pages = 997–1013 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.43.5.997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amabile, T. M. (1996). Creativity in context: Update to "The Social Psychology of Creativity". Boulder: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, there are 3 within-individual components needed for creativity – domain-relevant skills, creativity-relevant processes, and task motivation – and 1 component external to the individual: their surrounding social environment. Creativity requires a confluence of all components. High creativity will result when an individual is: intrinsically motivated, possesses both a high level of domain-relevant skills and has high skills in creative thinking, and is working in a highly creative environment.
*Amusement Park Theoretical Model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baer | first1 = J. | last2 = Kaufman | first2 = J. C. | year = 2005 | title = Bridging generality and specificity: The Amusement Park Theoretical (APT) Model of creativity | url = | journal = Roeper Review | volume = 27 | issue = 3| pages = 158–163 | doi=10.1080/02783190509554310}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this 4-step theory, both domain-specific and generalist views are integrated into a model of creativity. The researchers make use of the metaphor of the amusement park to demonstrate that within each of these creative levels, intelligence plays a key role:
**To get into the amusement park, there are initial requirements (e.g., time/transport to go to the park). Initial requirements (like intelligence) are necessary, but not sufficient for creativity. They are more like prerequisites for creativity, and if an individual does not possess the basic level of the initial requirement (intelligence), then they will not be able to generate creative thoughts/behaviour.
**Secondly are the subcomponents – general thematic areas – that increase in specificity. Like choosing which type of amusement park to visit (e.g. a zoo or a water park), these areas relate to the areas in which someone could be creative (e.g. poetry).
**Thirdly, there are specific domains. After choosing the type of park to visit e.g. waterpark, you then have to choose which specific park to go to. Within the poetry domain, there are many different types (e.g. free verse, riddles, sonnet, etc.) that have to be selected from.
**Lastly, there are micro-domains. These are the specific tasks that reside within each domain e.g. individual lines in a free verse poem / individual rides at the waterpark.

=== Creativity and intelligence as overlapping yet distinct constructs ===
This possible relationship concerns creativity and intelligence as distinct, but intersecting constructs.

''Theories that include Creativity and Intelligence as Overlapping Yet Distinct Constructs''

*Renzulli’s Three-Ring Conception of Giftedness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Renzulli | first1 = J. S. | year = 1978 | title = What makes giftedness? Reexamining a definition | url = | journal = Phi Delta Kappan | volume = 60 | issue = | pages = 180–261 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this conceptualisation, giftedness occurs as a result from the overlap of above average intellectual ability, creativity, and task commitment. Under this view, creativity and intelligence are distinct constructs, but they do overlap under the correct conditions.
*[[PASS theory of intelligence]]. In this theory, the planning component – relating to the ability to solve problems, make decisions and take action – strongly overlaps with the concept of creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Naglieri | first1 = J.

*Threshold Theory (TT). A number of previous research findings have suggested that a threshold exists in the relationship between creativity and intelligence – both constructs are moderately positively correlated up to an IQ of ~120. Above this threshold of an IQ of 120, if there is a relationship at all, it is small and weak.&lt;ref name="Getzels, J. W. 1962" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barron, F. 1963" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Torrance, E. P. (1962). Guiding creative talent. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; TT posits that a moderate level of intelligence is necessary for creativity.

In support of the TT, Barron&lt;ref name="Barron, F. 1963" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barron, F. (1969). Creative person and creative process. New York: Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston.&lt;/ref&gt; reported finding a non-significant correlation between creativity and intelligence in a gifted sample; and a significant correlation in a non-gifted sample.

Much modern day research reports findings against TT. Wai et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wai | first1 = J. | last2 = Lubinski | first2 = D. | last3 = Benbow | first3 = C. P. | year = 2005 | title = Creativity and occupational accomplishments among intellectually precocious youths: An age 13 to age 33 longitudinal study | url = | journal = Journal of Educational Psychology | volume = 97 | issue = 3| pages = 484–492 | doi=10.1037/0022-0663.97.3.484}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a study using data from the longitudinal Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth – a cohort of elite students from early adolescence into adulthood – found that differences in SAT scores at age 13 were predictive of creative real-life outcomes 20 years later. Kim’s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kim | first1 = K. H. | year = 2005 | title = Can only intelligent people be creative? | url = | journal = Journal of Secondary Gifted Education | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 57–66 }}&lt;/ref&gt; meta-analysis of 21 studies did not find any supporting evidence for TT, and instead negligible correlations were reported between intelligence, creativity, and divergent thinking both below and above IQ's of 120. Preckel et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Preckel | first1 = F. | last2 = Holling | first2 = H. | last3 = Wiese | first3 = M. | year = 2006 | title = Relationship of intelligence and creativity in gifted and non-gifted students: An investigation of threshold theory | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 40 | issue = | pages = 159–170 | doi=10.1016/j.paid.2005.06.022}}&lt;/ref&gt; investigating fluid intelligence and creativity, reported small correlations of ''r'' = .3 to ''r'' = .4 across all levels of cognitive ability.

=== Creativity and intelligence as coincident sets ===
Under this view, researchers posit that there are no differences in the mechanisms underlying creativity in those used in normal problem solving; and in normal problem solving, there is no need for creativity. Thus, creativity and Intelligence (problem solving) are the same thing. Perkins&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, D. N. (1981) The mind’s best work. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; referred to this as the ‘nothing-special’ view.

Weisberg &amp; Alba&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weisberg | first1 = R. W. | last2 = Alba | first2 = J. W. | year = 1981 | title = An examination of the alleged role of "fixation" in the solution of several "insight" problems | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: General | volume = 110 | issue = 2| pages = 169–192 | doi=10.1037/0096-3445.110.2.169}}&lt;/ref&gt; examined problem solving by having participants complete the 9-dot problem (see [[Thinking outside the box#Nine dots puzzle]]) – where the participants are asked to connect all 9 dots in the 3 rows of 3 dots using 4 straight lines or less, without lifting their pen or tracing the same line twice. The problem can only be solved if the lines go outside the boundaries of the square of dots. Results demonstrated that even when participants were given this insight, they still found it difficult to solve the problem, thus showing that to successfully complete the task it is not just insight (or creativity) that is required.

=== Creativity and intelligence as disjoint sets ===
In this view, creativity and intelligence are completely different, unrelated constructs.

Getzels and Jackson&lt;ref name="Getzels, J. W. 1962" /&gt; administered 5 creativity measures to a group of 449 children from grades 6-12, and compared these test findings to results from previously administered (by the school) IQ tests. They found that the correlation between the creativity measures and IQ was ''r'' = .26. The high creativity group scored in the top 20% of the overall creativity measures, but were not included in the top 20% of IQ scorers. The high intelligence group scored the opposite: they scored in the top 20% for IQ, but were outside the top 20% scorers for creativity, thus showing that creativity and intelligence are distinct and unrelated.

However, this work has been heavily criticised. Wallach and Kogan&lt;ref name="Wallach, M. A. 1965" /&gt; highlighted that the creativity measures were not only weakly related to one another (to the extent that they were no more related to one another than they were with IQ), but they seemed to also draw upon non-creative skills. McNemar&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McNemar | first1 = O | year = 1964 | title = Lost: Our Intelligence? Why? | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 19 | issue = 12| pages = 871–882 | doi=10.1037/h0042008}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted that there were major measurement issues, in that the IQ scores were a mixture from 3 different IQ tests.

Wallach and Kogan&lt;ref name="Wallach, M. A. 1965" /&gt; administered 5 measures of creativity, each of which resulted in a score for originality and fluency; and 10 measures of general intelligence to 151 5th grade children. These tests were untimed, and given in a game-like manner (aiming to facilitate creativity). Inter-correlations between creativity tests were on average ''r'' = .41. Inter-correlations between intelligence measures were on average ''r'' = .51 with each other. Creativity tests and intelligence measures correlated ''r'' = .09.

== Neuroscience ==
The [[neuroscience]] of creativity looks at the operation of the brain during creative behaviour. It has been addressed&lt;ref name="NeuroPsychiatry"&gt;[http://neurology.med.ohio-state.edu/cognitivelab/CreativityMechanisms.pdf Kenneth M Heilman, MD, Stephen E. Nadeau, MD, and David Q. Beversdorf, MD. "Creative Innovation: Possible Brain Mechanisms" Neurocase (2003)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319130652/http://neurology.med.ohio-state.edu/cognitivelab/CreativityMechanisms.pdf |date=2009-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the article "Creative Innovation: Possible Brain Mechanisms." The authors write that "creative innovation might require coactivation and communication between regions of the brain that ordinarily are not strongly connected." Highly creative people who excel at creative innovation tend to differ from others in three ways:
* they have a high level of specialized knowledge,
* they are capable of [[convergent and divergent production|divergent thinking]] mediated by the [[frontal lobe]].
* and they are able to modulate [[neurotransmitter]]s such as [[norepinephrine]] in their frontal lobe.

Thus, the frontal lobe appears to be the part of the [[cerebral cortex|cortex]] that is most important for creativity.

This article also explored the links between creativity and sleep, [[mood disorder|mood]] and [[substance dependence|addiction disorders]], and [[depression (mood)|depression]].

In 2005, Alice Flaherty presented a three-factor model of the creative drive. Drawing from evidence in brain imaging, drug studies and lesion analysis, she described the creative drive as resulting from an interaction of the frontal lobes, the [[temporal lobe]]s, and [[dopamine]] from the [[limbic system]]. The frontal lobes can be seen as responsible for idea generation, and the temporal lobes for idea editing and evaluation. Abnormalities in the frontal lobe (such as depression or anxiety) generally decrease creativity, while abnormalities in the temporal lobe often increase creativity. High activity in the temporal lobe typically inhibits activity in the frontal lobe, and vice versa. High dopamine levels increase general [[arousal]] and goal directed behaviors and reduce [[latent inhibition]], and all three effects increase the drive to generate ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Flaherty AW | year = 2005 | title = Frontotemporal and dopaminergic control of idea generation and creative drive | url = | journal = J Comp Neurol | volume = 493 | issue = 1| pages = 147–53 | pmid = 16254989 | pmc = 2571074 | doi=10.1002/cne.20768}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2015 study on creativity found that it involves the interaction of multiple neural networks, including those that support associative thinking, along with other [[default mode network]] functions.&lt;ref name=PMID_26003860&gt;{{ cite journal |last1 = Mayseless |first1 = Naama |last2 = Eran |first2 = Ayelet |last3 = Shamay-Tsoory |first3 = Simone G |year = 2015 |title = Generating original ideas: The neural underpinning of originality. |journal = NeuroImage |quote = These results are in line with the dual model of creativity, according to which original ideas are a product of the interaction between a system that generates ideas and a control system that evaluates these ideas. |laysummary = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26003860 |doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.05.030|pmid = 26003860 |pages = 232–9 |volume = 116 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Working memory and the cerebellum ===
Vandervert&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert 2003a, 2003b; Vandervert, Schimpf &amp; Liu, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; described how the brain's frontal lobes and the cognitive functions of the [[cerebellum]] collaborate to produce creativity and innovation. Vandervert's explanation rests on considerable evidence that all processes of [[working memory]] (responsible for processing all thought&lt;ref&gt;Miyake &amp; Shah, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;) are adaptively modeled for increased efficiency by the cerebellum.&lt;ref&gt;Schmahmann, 1997, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The cerebellum (consisting of 100 billion neurons, which is more than the entirety of the rest of the brain&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, Korbo &amp; Pakkenberg, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;) is also widely known to adaptively model all bodily movement for efficiency. The cerebellum's adaptive models of working memory processing are then fed back to especially frontal lobe working memory control processes&lt;ref&gt;Miller &amp; Cohen, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; where creative and innovative thoughts arise.&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert, 2003a&lt;/ref&gt; (Apparently, creative insight or the "aha" experience is then triggered in the temporal lobe.&lt;ref&gt;Jung-Beeman, Bowden, Haberman, Frymiare, Arambel-Liu, Greenblatt, Reber &amp; Kounios, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;)

According to Vandervert, the details of creative adaptation begin in "forward" cerebellar models which are anticipatory/exploratory controls for movement and thought. These cerebellar processing and control architectures have been termed Hierarchical Modular Selection and Identification for Control (HMOSAIC).&lt;ref&gt;Imamizu, Kuroda, Miyauchi, Yoshioka &amp; Kawato, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; New, hierarchically arranged levels of the cerebellar control architecture (HMOSAIC) develop as mental mulling in working memory is extended over time. These new levels of the control architecture are fed forward to the frontal lobes. Since the cerebellum adaptively models all movement and all levels of thought and emotion,&lt;ref&gt;Schmahmann, 2004,&lt;/ref&gt; Vandervert's approach helps explain creativity and innovation in sports, art, music, the design of video games, technology, mathematics, the [[child prodigy]], and thought in general.

Essentially, Vandervert has argued that when a person is confronted with a challenging new situation, visual-spatial working memory and speech-related working memory are decomposed and re-composed (fractionated) by the cerebellum and then blended in the cerebral cortex in an attempt to deal with the new situation. With repeated attempts to deal with challenging situations, the cerebro-cerebellar blending process continues to optimize the efficiency of how working memory deals with the situation or problem.&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert, in press-a&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently, he has argued that this is the same process (only involving visual-spatial working memory and pre-language vocalization) that led to the evolution of language in humans.&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert, 2011, in press-b&lt;/ref&gt; Vandervert and Vandervert-Weathers have pointed out that this blending process, because it continuously optimizes efficiencies, constantly improves prototyping attempts toward the invention or innovation of new ideas, music, art, or technology.&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert &amp; Vandervert-Weathers, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Prototyping, they argue, not only produces new products, it trains the cerebro-cerebellar pathways involved to become more efficient at prototyping itself. Further, Vandervert and Vandervert-Weathers believe that this repetitive "mental prototyping" or mental rehearsal involving the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex explains the success of the self-driven, individualized patterning of repetitions initiated by the teaching methods of the [[Khan Academy]]. The model proposed by Vandervert has, however, received incisive critique from several authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = J. | year = 2007 | title = On Vandervert et al.

=== REM sleep ===
Creativity involves the forming of associative elements into new combinations that are useful or meet some requirement. Sleep aids this process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature02223 |author1=Wagner U. |author2=Gais S. |author3=Haider H. |author4=Verleger R. |author5=Born J. | year = 2004 | title = Sleep inspires insight | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 427 | issue = 6972| pages = 352–5 | pmid = 14737168 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rapid eye movement sleep|REM]] rather than [[Non-rapid eye movement sleep|NREM sleep]] appears to be responsible.&lt;ref name="Cai"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0900271106 |author1=Cai D.

It is proposed that REM sleep adds creativity by allowing "neocortical structures to reorganize associative hierarchies, in which information from the hippocampus would be reinterpreted in relation to previous semantic representations or nodes."&lt;ref name="Cai" /&gt;

== Affect ==
Some theories suggest that creativity may be particularly susceptible to affective influence. As noted in [[voting behavior]], the term "affect" in this context can refer to liking or disliking key aspects of the subject in question. This work largely follows from findings in psychology regarding the ways in which affective states are involved in human judgment and decision-making.&lt;ref name=Winkielman2007&gt;{{Citation

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Positive affect relations ===
According to [[Alice M. Isen|Alice Isen]], positive affect has three primary effects on cognitive activity:
# Positive affect makes additional cognitive material available for processing, increasing the number of cognitive elements available for association;
# Positive affect leads to defocused attention and a more complex cognitive context, increasing the breadth of those elements that are treated as relevant to the problem;
# Positive affect increases cognitive flexibility, increasing the probability that diverse cognitive elements will in fact become associated. Together, these processes lead positive affect to have a positive influence on creativity.

[[Barbara Fredrickson]] in her [[broaden-and-build]] model suggests that positive emotions such as joy and love broaden a person's available repertoire of cognitions and actions, thus enhancing creativity.

According to these researchers, positive emotions increase the number of cognitive elements available for association (attention scope) and the number of elements that are relevant to the problem (cognitive scope).

Various meta-analyses, such as Baas et al. (2008) of 66 studies about creativity and affect support the link between creativity and positive affect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mark A.

== Creativity and artificial intelligence ==
[[Jürgen Schmidhuber]]'s formal [[theory]] of creativity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidhuber | first1 = Jürgen | year = 2006 | title = Developmental Robotics, Optimal Artificial Curiosity, Creativity, Music, and the Fine Arts | url = | journal = Connection Science | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 173–187 | doi=10.1080/09540090600768658| citeseerx = 10.1.1.474.6919 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidhuber | first1 = Jürgen | year = 2010 | title = Formal Theory of Creativity, Fun, and Intrinsic Motivation (1990–2010) | url = | journal = IEEE Transactions on Autonomous Mental Development | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 230–247 | doi=10.1109/tamd.2010.2056368}}&lt;/ref&gt; postulates that creativity, curiosity, and interestingness are by-products of a simple [[Computational learning theory|computational]] principle for measuring and optimizing learning progress. Consider an agent able to manipulate its environment and thus its own [[sensory system|sensory]] inputs. The agent can use a [[black box]] optimization method such as [[reinforcement learning]] to learn (through informed trial and error) sequences of actions that maximize the expected sum of its future [[reward system|reward]] signals. There are extrinsic reward signals for achieving externally given goals, such as finding food when hungry. But Schmidhuber's [[Loss function|objective function]] to be maximized also includes an additional, intrinsic term to model "wow-effects." This non-standard term motivates purely creative behavior of the agent even when there are no external goals. A wow-effect is formally defined as follows. As the agent is creating and predicting and encoding the continually growing history of actions and sensory inputs, it keeps improving the predictor or encoder, which can be implemented as an [[artificial neural network]] or some other [[machine learning]] device that can exploit regularities in the data to improve its performance over time. The improvements can be measured precisely, by computing the difference in computational costs (storage size, number of required synapses, errors, time) needed to encode new observations before and after learning. This difference depends on the encoder's present subjective knowledge, which changes over time, but the theory formally takes this into account. The cost difference measures the strength of the present "wow-effect" due to sudden improvements in [[data compression]] or computational speed. It becomes an intrinsic reward signal for the action selector. The objective function thus motivates the action optimizer to create action sequences causing more wow-effects. Irregular, random data (or noise) do not permit any wow-effects or learning progress, and thus are "boring" by nature (providing no reward). Already known and predictable regularities also are boring. Temporarily interesting are only the initially unknown, novel, regular patterns in both actions and observations. This motivates the agent to perform continual, open-ended, active, creative exploration.

According to Schmidhuber, his objective function explains the activities of scientists, artists, and [[comedian]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Video of [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]]'s keynote at the 2011 Winter Intelligence Conference, Oxford: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnbZzcruGu0 Universal AI and Theory of Fun and Creativity.

Youtube, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, [[physicist]]s are motivated to create experiments leading to observations obeying previously unpublished [[physical law]]s permitting better [[data compression]]. Likewise, composers receive intrinsic reward for creating non-arbitrary melodies with unexpected but regular harmonies that permit wow-effects through data compression improvements.
Similarly, a comedian gets intrinsic reward for "inventing a novel joke with an unexpected [[punch line]], related to the beginning of the story in an initially unexpected but quickly learnable way that also allows for better compression of the perceived data."&lt;ref&gt;Kurzweil AI: [http://www.kurzweilai.net/when-creative-machines-overtake-man Transcript] of [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]]'s TEDx talk (2012): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ35zNlyG-o&amp;list=PL194623EBA834DB77&amp;index=11 When creative machines overtake man]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mental health ==
{{Main|Creativity and mental illness}}
A study by psychologist [[J. Philippe Rushton]] found creativity to correlate with [[intelligence]] and [[psychoticism]].&lt;ref&gt;(Rushton, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found creativity to be greater in [[Schizotypal personality disorder|schizotypal]] than in either normal or [[Schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] individuals. While divergent thinking was associated with bilateral activation of the [[prefrontal cortex]], schizotypal individuals were found to have much greater activation of their ''right'' prefrontal cortex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.schres.2005.06.016 |pmid=16125369 |url=http://exploration.vanderbilt.edu/news/news_schizotypes.htm |accessdate=2006-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060215212520/http://exploration.vanderbilt.edu/news/news_schizotypes.htm |archivedate=2006-02-15 |df= |volume=80 |issue=2–3 |title=Verbal creativity and schizotypal personality in relation to prefrontal hemispheric laterality: A behavioral and near-infrared optical imaging study |year=2005 |journal=Schizophrenia Research |pages=271–282 | last1 = Folley | first1 = Bradley S. | last2 = Park | first2 = Sohee|pmc=2817946 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This study hypothesizes that such individuals are better at accessing both hemispheres, allowing them to make novel associations at a faster rate. In agreement with this hypothesis, [[ambidexterity]] is also associated with [[Schizotypal personality disorder|schizotypal]] and [[Schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] individuals.

Particularly strong links have been identified between creativity and [[mood disorder]]s, particularly [[Bipolar disorder|manic-depressive disorder]] (a.k.a. [[bipolar disorder]]) and [[Major depressive disorder|depressive disorder]] (a.k.a. [[Major depressive disorder|unipolar disorder]]). In ''Touched with Fire: Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament'', [[Kay Redfield Jamison]] summarizes studies of mood-disorder rates in [[writer]]s, [[poet]]s, and [[artist]]s. She also explores research that identifies [[mood disorder]]s in such famous writers and artists as [[Ernest Hemingway]] (who shot himself after [[Electroconvulsive therapy|electroconvulsive treatment]]), [[Virginia Woolf]] (who drowned herself when she felt a depressive episode coming on), composer [[Robert Schumann]] (who died in a mental institution), and even the famed [[Visual arts|visual artist]] [[Michelangelo]]. A different case study suggested for Schumann a difference between bipolar disorder and "creative bipolarity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holm-Hadulla|first=Rainer Matthias|last2=Koutsoukou-Argyraki|first2=Asimina|date=2017|title=Bipolar Disorder and/or Creative Bipolarity: Robert Schumann's Exemplary Psychopathology - Combining Symptomatological and Psychosocial Perspectives with Creativity Research|url=https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/479883|journal=Psychopathology|language=english|volume=50|issue=6|pages=379–388|doi=10.1159/000479883|pmid=29017153|issn=0254-4962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study looking at 300,000 persons with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or unipolar depression, and their relatives, found overrepresentation in creative professions for those with bipolar disorder as well as for undiagnosed siblings of those with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. There was no overall overrepresentation, but overrepresentation for artistic occupations, among those diagnosed with schizophrenia. There was no association for those with unipolar depression or their relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kyaga | first1 = S. | last2 = Lichtenstein | first2 = P. | last3 = Boman | first3 = M. | last4 = Hultman | first4 = C. | last5 = Långström | first5 = N. | last6 = Landén | first6 = M. | title = Creativity and mental disorder: Family study of 300 000 people with severe mental disorder | doi = 10.1192/bjp.bp.110.085316 | journal = The British Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 199 | issue = 5 | pages = 373–379 | year = 2011 | pmid =  21653945| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another case study suggested a difference between severe mood disorders and "creative melancholy", pointing out mild and moderate depression may inspire creative achievements while severe depression inhibits and may even destroy creative activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holm-Hadulla|first=Rainer M.|last2=Roussel|first2=Martin|last3=Hofmann|first3=Frank-Hagen|date=2010-12|title=Depression and creativity — The case of the german poet, scientist and statesman J.

Another study involving more than one million people, conducted by Swedish researchers at the Karolinska Institute, reported a number of correlations between creative occupations and mental illnesses. Writers had a higher risk of anxiety and bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, unipolar depression, and substance abuse, and were almost twice as likely as the general population to kill themselves. Dancers and photographers were also more likely to have bipolar disorder.&lt;ref name="bbc health-19959565"&gt;Roberts, Michelle. Creativity 'closely entwined with mental illness'. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-19959565. 16 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as a group, those in the creative professions were no more likely to suffer from psychiatric disorders than other people, although they were more likely to have a close relative with a disorder, including anorexia and, to some extent, autism, the Journal of Psychiatric Research reports.&lt;ref name="bbc health-19959565" /&gt;

According to psychologist Robert Epstein, PhD, creativity can be obstructed through stress.&lt;ref name="apa.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/gradpsych/2009/01/creativity.aspx|title=The science of creativity|website=apa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Creativity and personality ==
Creativity can be expressed in a number of different forms, depending on unique people and environments. A number of different theorists have suggested models of the creative person. One model suggests that there are kinds to produce growth, innovation, speed, etc. These are referred to as the four "Creativity Profiles" that can help achieve such goals.&lt;ref&gt;(DeGraff, Lawrence 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;
:(i) ''Incubate'' (Long-term Development)
:(ii) ''Imagine'' (Breakthrough Ideas)
:(iii) ''Improve'' (Incremental Adjustments)
:(iv) ''Invest'' (Short-term Goals)

Research by Dr Mark Batey of the Psychometrics at Work Research Group at [[Manchester Business School]] has suggested that the creative profile can be explained by four primary creativity traits with narrow facets within each

: (i) "Idea Generation" (Fluency, Originality, Incubation and Illumination)
: (ii) "Personality" (Curiosity and Tolerance for Ambiguity)
: (iii) "Motivation" (Intrinsic, Extrinsic and Achievement)
: (iv) "Confidence" (Producing, Sharing and Implementing)

This model was developed in a sample of 1000 working adults using the statistical techniques of Exploratory Factor Analysis followed by Confirmatory Factor Analysis by Structural Equation Modelling.&lt;ref&gt;(Batey &amp; Irwing, 2010) {{cite web |url=http://www.e-metrixx.com/creativity-profit/me2-spec/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710161255/http://www.e-metrixx.com/creativity-profit/me2-spec/ |archivedate=2011-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important aspect of the creativity profiling approach is to account for the tension between predicting the creative profile of an individual, as characterised by the [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] approach, and the evidence that team creativity is founded on diversity and difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Nijstad B. A. |author2=De Dreu C. K. | year = 2002 | title = Creativity and Group Innovation | url = | journal = Applied Psychology | volume = 51 | issue = 3| pages = 400–406 | doi = 10.1111/1464-0597.00984 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One characteristic of creative people, as measured by some psychologists, is what is called ''divergent production''. ''Divergent production'' is the ability of a person to generate a diverse assortment, yet an appropriate amount of responses to a given situation.&lt;ref&gt;(Guilford, 1950)&lt;/ref&gt; One way of measuring ''divergent production'' is by administering the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking.&lt;ref&gt;(Torrance, 1974, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt; The Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking assesses the diversity, quantity, and appropriateness of participants responses to a variety of open-ended questions.

Other researchers of creativity see the difference in creative people as a cognitive process of dedication to problem solving and developing expertise in the field of their creative expression. Hard working people study the work of people before them and within their current area, become experts in their fields, and then have the ability to add to and build upon previous information in innovative and creative ways. In a study of projects by design students, students who had more knowledge on their subject on average had greater creativity within their projects.&lt;ref&gt;(Christiaans &amp; Venselaar, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The aspect of motivation within a person's personality may predict creativity levels in the person. Motivation stems from two different sources, intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation is an internal drive within a person to participate or invest as a result of personal interest, desires, hopes, goals, etc. Extrinsic motivation is a drive from outside of a person and might take the form of payment, rewards, fame, approval from others, etc. Although extrinsic motivation and intrinsic motivation can both increase creativity in certain cases, strictly extrinsic motivation often impedes creativity in people.&lt;ref&gt;(Amabile, 1996; Prabhu et al., 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

From a personality-traits perspective, there are a number of traits that are associated with creativity in people.&lt;ref&gt;(Feist, 1998, 1999; Prabhu et al., 2008; Zhang &amp; Sternberg, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Creative people tend to be more open to new experiences, are more self-confident, are more ambitious, self-accepting, impulsive, driven, dominant, and hostile, compared to people with less creativity.

From an evolutionary perspective, creativity may be a result of the outcome of years of generating ideas. As ideas are continuously generated, the need to evolve produces a need for new ideas and developments. As a result, people have been creating and developing new, innovative, and creative ideas to build our progress as a society.&lt;ref&gt;(Campbell, 1960)&lt;/ref&gt;

In studying exceptionally creative people in history, some common traits in lifestyle and environment are often found. Creative people in history usually had supportive parents, but rigid and non-nurturing. Most had an interest in their field at an early age, and most had a highly supportive and skilled mentor in their field of interest. Often the field they chose was relatively uncharted, allowing for their creativity to be expressed more in a field with less previous information. Most exceptionally creative people devoted almost all of their time and energy into their craft, and after about a decade had a creative breakthrough of fame. Their lives were marked with extreme dedication and a cycle of hard-work and breakthroughs as a result of their determination.&lt;ref&gt;(Gardner, 1993a, Policastro &amp; Gardner, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another theory of creative people is the ''investment theory of creativity''. This approach suggest that there are many individual and environmental factors that must exist in precise ways for extremely high levels of creativity opposed to average levels of creativity. In the ''investment'' sense, a person with their particular characteristics in their particular environment may see an opportunity to devote their time and energy into something that has been overlooked by others. The creative person develops an undervalued or under-recognised idea to the point that it is established as a new and creative idea. Just like in the financial world, some investments are worth the buy in, while others are less productive and do not build to the extent that the investor expected. This ''investment theory of creativity'' views creativity in a unique perspective compared to others, by asserting that creativity might rely to some extent on the right investment of effort being added to a field at the right time in the right way.&lt;ref&gt;(Sternberg &amp; Lubart, 1991, 1995, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Malevolent creativity ==
Malevolent creativity (MC) focuses on the "darker side" of creativity.&lt;ref name="The dark side of creativity"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McLaren | first1 = R. B. | year = 1993 | title = The dark side of creativity | url = | journal = Creat. Res. J. | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 137–144 | doi = 10.1080/10400419309534472 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of creativity is not typically accepted within society and is defined by the intention to cause harm to others through original and innovative means. MC should be distinguished from negative creativity in that negative creativity may unintentionally cause harm to others, whereas MC is explicitly malevolently motivated. MC is often a key contributor to crime and in its most destructive form can even manifest as terrorism. However, MC can also be observed in ordinary day-to-day life as lying, cheating and betrayal.&lt;ref name="Measure Malevolent Creativity 2016"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hao | first1 = N | last2 = Tang | first2 = M | last3 = Yang | first3 = J | last4 = Wang | first4 = Q | last5 = Runco | first5 = MA | year = 2016 | title = A New Tool to Measure Malevolent Creativity: The Malevolent Creativity Behavior Scale | url = | journal = Frontiers in Psychology | volume = 7 | issue = | page = 682 | doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00682 | pmid = 27242596 | pmc = 4870273 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although everyone shows some levels of MC under certain conditions, those that have a higher propensity towards malevolent creativity have increased tendencies to deceive and manipulate others to their own gain. Although levels of MC appear to dramatically increase when an individual is placed under unfair conditions, personality is also a key predictor in anticipating levels of malevolent thinking. Researches Harris and Reiter-Palmon investigated the role of aggression in levels of MC, in particular levels of implicit aggression and the tendency to employ aggressive actions in response to problem solving.  The personality traits of physical aggression, conscientiousness, emotional intelligence and implicit aggression all seem to be related with MC.&lt;ref name="The dark side of creativity"/&gt; Harris and Reiter-Palmon's research showed that when subjects were presented with a problem that triggered malevolent creativity, participants high in implicit aggression and low in premeditation expressed the largest number of malevolently-themed solutions. When presented with the more benign problem that triggered prosocial motives of helping others and cooperating, those high in implicit aggression, even if they were high in impulsiveness, were far less destructive in their imagined solutions. They concluded premeditation, more than implicit aggression controlled an individual’s expression of malevolent creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harris | first1 = D. J. | last2 = Reiter-Palmon | first2 = R. | year = 2015 | title = Fast and furious: The influence of implicit aggression, premeditation, and provoking situations on malevolent creativity | url = | journal = Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 54–64 | doi = 10.1037/a0038499 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current measure for malevolent creativity is the 13 item test Malevolent Creativity Behaviour Scale (MCBS) &lt;ref name="Measure Malevolent Creativity 2016"/&gt;

===Malevolent creativity and crime===
Malevolent creativity has strong links with crime. As creativity requires deviating from the conventional, there is a permanent tension between being creative and producing products that go too far and in some cases to the point of breaking the law. Aggression is a key predictor of malevolent creativity, and studies have also shown that increased levels of aggression also correlates to a higher likelihood of committing crime.&lt;ref&gt;Aggression: A social psychological analysis.

== Creativity across cultures ==
Creativity is viewed differently in different countries.&lt;ref&gt;Sternberg RJ 'Introduction' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (2006) (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' pp 1-9. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, cross-cultural research centred on [[Hong Kong]] found that Westerners view creativity more in terms of the individual attributes of a creative person, such as their aesthetic taste, while Chinese people view creativity more in terms of the social influence of creative people e.g. what they can contribute to society.&lt;ref&gt;Niu W (2006) 'Development of Creativity Research in Chinese Societies' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' pp 386-387. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mpofu et al. surveyed 28 African languages and found that 27 had no word which directly translated to 'creativity' (the exception being [[Arabic]]).&lt;ref&gt;Mpofu E et al (2006) 'African Perspectives on Creativity' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' p 465. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of [[linguistic relativity]], i.e. that language can affect thought, suggests that the lack of an equivalent word for 'creativity' may affect the views of creativity among speakers of such languages. However, more research would be needed to establish this, and there is certainly no suggestion that this linguistic difference makes people any less (or more) creative; [[Africa]] has a rich heritage of creative pursuits such as [[music]], [[art]], and [[storytelling]]. Nevertheless, it is true that there has been very little research on creativity in Africa,&lt;ref&gt;Mpofu E et al (2006) 'African Perspectives on Creativity' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' p 458. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there has also been very little research on creativity in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;Preiss DD and Strasser K (2006) 'Creativity in Latin America' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' p 46. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creativity has been more thoroughly researched in the northern hemisphere, but here again there are cultural differences, even between countries or groups of countries in close proximity. For example, in Scandinavian countries, creativity is seen as an individual attitude which helps in coping with life's challenges,&lt;ref&gt;Smith GJW and Carlsson I (2006) 'Creativity under the Northern Lights' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' p 202. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in Germany, creativity is seen more as a process that can be applied to help solve problems.&lt;ref&gt;Preiser S (2006) 'Creativity Research in German-Speaking Countries' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' p 175. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In organizations ==
[[File:Training meeting in a ecodesign stainless steel company in brazil.JPG|thumb|right|Training meeting in an eco-design stainless steel company in [[Brazil]]. The leaders among other things wish to cheer and encourage the workers in order to achieve a higher level of creativity.]]

It has been the topic of various research studies to establish that organizational effectiveness depends on the creativity of the workforce to a large extent. For any given organization, measures of effectiveness vary, depending upon its mission, environmental context, nature of work, the product or service it produces, and customer demands. Thus, the first step in evaluating organizational effectiveness is to understand the organization itself — how it functions, how it is structured, and what it emphasizes.

Amabile&lt;ref name="Amabile98"&gt;(Amabile, 1998; Sullivan and Harper, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; argued that to enhance creativity in business, three components were needed:
* Expertise (technical, procedural and intellectual knowledge),
* Creative thinking skills (how flexibly and imaginatively people approach problems),
* and Motivation (especially [[intrinsic motivation]]).

There are two types of motivation:
* [[Motivation|extrinsic motivation]] – [[Externality|external]] factors, for example [[threat]]s of being fired or money as a reward,
* [[intrinsic motivation]] – comes from inside an individual, satisfaction, enjoyment of work, etc.

Six managerial practices to encourage motivation are:
* Challenge – matching people with the right assignments;
* Freedom – giving people [[autonomy]] choosing means to achieve goals;
* [[Resource]]s – such as time, money, space, etc. There must be balance fit among resources and people;
* Work group features – [[Cultural diversity|diverse]], supportive teams, where members share the excitement, willingness to help, and recognize each other's talents;

Nonaka, who examined several successful Japanese companies, similarly saw creativity and knowledge creation as being important to the success of organizations.&lt;ref name="Nonaka91"&gt;(Nonaka, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, he emphasized the role that [[tacit knowledge]] has to play in the creative process.

In business, [[originality]] is not enough. The idea must also be appropriate—useful and [[Cause of action|actionable]].&lt;ref&gt;Amabile, T. M. (1998). "How to kill creativity". Harvard Business Review&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Siltala, R. 2010. Innovativity and cooperative learning in business life and teaching. University of Turku&lt;/ref&gt; [[Competitive intelligence|Creative competitive intelligence]] is a new solution to solve this problem. According to Reijo Siltala it links creativity to [[innovation]] process and [[competitive intelligence]] to creative workers.

Creativity can be encouraged in people and professionals and in the workplace. It is essential for innovation, and is a factor affecting economic growth and businesses. In 2013, the sociologist Silvia Leal Martín, using the Innova 3DX method, suggested measuring the various parameters that encourage creativity and innovation: corporate culture, work environment, leadership and management, creativity, self-esteem and optimism, locus of control and learning orientation, motivation, and fear.&lt;ref&gt;Leal, S. y Urrea J.

Similarly, social psychologists, organizational scientists, and management scientists who conduct extensive research on the factors that influence creativity and innovation in teams and organizations have developed integrative theoretical models that emphasize the roles of team composition, team processes, and organizational culture, as well as the mutually reinforcing relationships between them in promoting innovation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Woodman | first1 = R.

The investigation by Loo (2017) &lt;ref&gt;Loo, S. (2017) Creative Working in the Knowledge Economy. Abingdon, Oxfordshire: Routledge Ltd. {{ISBN|9781138211391}}; {{ISBN|9781315453095}}. https://www.routledge.com/Creative-Working-in-the-Knowledge-Economy/Loo/p/book/9781138211391&lt;/ref&gt; on creative working in the knowledge economy brings together studies of creativity as delineated in this web page. It offers connections with the sections on the ‘”Four C” model’, ‘Theories of creative processes’, ‘Creativity as a subset of intelligence’, ‘Creativity and personality’, and ‘In organisations’ It is the last section that the investigation addresses.

Research studies of the knowledge economy may be classified into three levels: macro, meso and micro. Macro studies refer to investigations at a societal or transnational dimension. Meso studies focus on organisations. Micro investigations centre on the minutiae workings of workers. There is also an interdisciplinary dimension such as research from businesses (e.g. Burton-Jones, 1999; Drucker, 1999), economics (e.g. Cortada, 1998; Reich, 2001; Florida, 2003), education (e.g. Farrell and Fenwick, 2007; Brown, Lauder and Ashton, 2011), human resource management (e.g. Davenport, 2005), knowledge and organizational management (Alvesson, 2004; Defillippi, Arthur and Lindsay, 2006; Orr, Nutley, Russell, Bain, Hacking and Moran, 2016), sociology, psychology, and knowledge economy-related sectors – especially information technology (IT) software (e.g. O’Riain, 2004; Nerland, 2008) and advertising (e.g. Grabher, 2004; Lury, 2004) (Loo, 2017).

Loo (2017) studies how individual workers in the knowledge economy use their creativity and know-how in the advertising and IT software sectors. It examines this phenomenon across three developed countries of England, Japan and Singapore to observe global perspectives. Specifically, the study uses qualitative data from semi-structured interviews of the related professionals in the roles of creative directing and copywriting (in advertising), and systems software developing and software programme managing.

The study offers a conceptual framework (Loo, 2017, p.&amp;nbsp;49) of a two-dimensional matrix of individual and collaborative working styles, and single and multi-contexts. The investigation draws on literature sources from the four disciplines of economics (e.g. Reich, 2001; Quah, 2002), management (e.g. ,Drucker, 1994; Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995; von Hippel, 2006), sociology (e.g. Zuboff, 1988; Bell, 1973; Lash and Urry, 1994; Castells, 2000; Knorr Cetina, 2005),  and psychology (e.g. Gardner, 1984; Csikszentmihalyi, 1988; Sternberg, Kaufman and Pretz, 2004). The themes arising from the analysis of knowledge work and creativity literature serve to create a distinct theoretical framework of creative knowledge work.  These workers apply their cognitive abilities, creative personalities and skill sets in the areas of science, technology, or culture industries to invent or discover new possibilities – e.g. a medium, product or service. These work activities may be done individually or collectively. Education, training and ‘encultured environments’ are necessary for the performance of these creative activities. Acts of creativity are viewed as asking new questions over and above those questions asked by an intelligent person, seeking novelty when reviewing a situation (Gardner, 1993), and creating something that is different and novel, i.e. a ‘variation’ on the idea of existing ideas in a domain (Csikszentmihalyi, 1988). This framework is evidenced by the empirical chapters on the micro-workings of creative workers in the two knowledge economy sectors from global perspectives.

This investigation identifies a definition of creative work, three types of work and the necessary conditions for it to occur. These workers use a combination of creative applications including anticipatory imagination, problem-solving, problem seeking, and generating ideas and aesthetic sensibilities. Taking aesthetic sensibilities as an example, for a creative director in the advertising industry, it is a visual imagery whether still or moving via a camera lens, and for a software programmer, it is the innovative technical expertise in which the software is written. There are specific creative applications for each of the sectors such as emotional connection in the advertising sector, and the power of expression and sensitivity in the IT software sector. In addition to the creative applications, creative workers require abilities and aptitudes to carry out their roles. Passion for one’s job is generic. For copywriters, this passion is identified with fun, enjoyment and happiness alongside attributes such as honesty (regarding the product), confidence, and patience in finding the appropriate copy. Knowledge is also required in the disciplines of the humanities (e.g. literature), the creative arts (e.g. painting and music) and technical-related know-how (e.g. mathematics, computer sciences and physical sciences). In the IT software, technical knowledge of computer languages (e.g. C++) is especially significant for programmers whereas the degree of technical expertise may be less for a programme manager, as only knowledge of the relevant language is necessary to understand the issues for communicating with the team of developers and testers.

There are three types of work. One is intra-sectoral (e.g. ‘general sponge’ and ’in tune with the zeitgeist’ [advertising], and ‘power of expression’ and ‘sensitivity’ [IT software]). The second is inter-sectoral (e.g. ‘integration of advertising activities’ [advertising], and ‘autonomous decentralized systems’ [ADS] [IT software]). The third relates to changes in culture/practices in the sectors (e.g. ‘three-dimensional trust’ and ‘green credentials’ [advertising], and ‘collaboration with HEIs and industry’ and ‘ADS system in the Tokyo train operator’ [IT software]).

The necessary conditions for creative work to exist are a supportive environment such as supportive information, communications and electronic technologies (ICET) infrastructure, training, work environment and education.

This investigation has implications for lifelong learning of these workers informally and formally. Teaching institutions need to offer multi-disciplinary knowledge of humanities, arts and sciences and it has impacts on the programme structure, delivery approaches and assessments. At a macro level, governments need to offer a rich diet of cultural activities, outdoor activities and sports fixtures that inform potential creative workers in the areas of video gaming and advertising. This study has implications for work organisations that support and encourage collaborative working alongside individual working, offer opportunities to engage in continuous professional development (formally and informally), and foster an environment, which promotes experiential functioning and supports experimentation.

'''[[Team Composition]]'''

Diversity between team members’ backgrounds and knowledge can increase team creativity by expanding the total collection of unique information that is available to the team and introducing different perspectives that can integrate in novel ways. However, under some conditions, diversity can also decrease team creativity by making it more difficult for team members to communicate about ideas and causing interpersonal conflicts between those with different perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harvey | first1 = S | year = 2013 | title = A different perspective: The multiple effects of deep level diversity on group creativity | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 49 | issue = 5| pages = 822–832 | doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2013.04.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the potential advantages of diversity must be supported by appropriate team processes and organizational cultures in order to enhance creativity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Paletz | first1 = S.

'''Team Processes'''

Team communication [[norm (social)|norm]]s, such as respecting others’ expertise, paying attention to others’ ideas, expecting information sharing, tolerating disagreements, [[negotiation|negotiating]], remaining open to others’ ideas, learning from others, and building on each other’s ideas, increase team creativity by facilitating the social processes involved with [[brainstorming]] and [[problem solving]]. Through these processes, team members are able to access their collective pool of knowledge, reach shared understandings, identify new ways of understanding problems or tasks, and make new connections between ideas. Engaging in these social processes also promotes positive team [[Affect (psychology)|affect]], which facilitates collective creativity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[Organizational culture|'''Organizational Culture''']]

Supportive and motivational environments that create [[psychological safety]] by encouraging risk taking and tolerating mistakes increase team creativity as well.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Organizations in which [[help-seeking]], [[Helping behavior|help giving]], and [[collaboration]] are rewarded promote innovation by providing opportunities and contexts in which team processes that lead to collective creativity can occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hargadon | first1 = A.

==Economic views of creativity==
Economic approaches to creativity have focussed on three aspects — the impact of creativity on economic growth, methods of modelling markets for creativity, and the maximisation of economic creativity (innovation).

In the early 20th century, [[Joseph Schumpeter]] introduced the economic theory of ''[[creative destruction]]'', to describe the way in which old ways of doing things are endogenously destroyed and replaced by the new. Some economists (such as [[Paul Romer]]) view creativity as an important element in the recombination of elements to produce new technologies and products and, consequently, economic growth. Creativity leads to [[capital (economics)|capital]], and creative products are protected by [[intellectual property]] laws.

[[Mark A. Runco]] and Daniel Rubenson have tried to describe a "[[Behavioral economics|psychoeconomic]]" model of creativity.&lt;ref name="RubRunc1992"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0732-118X(92)90021-Q|last=Rubenson|first=Daniel L.|author2=Runco, Mark |authorlink2=Mark A. Runco |title=The psychoeconomic approach to creativity|journal=New Ideas in Psychology|year=1992|volume=10|issue=2|pages=131–147}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such a model, creativity is the product of endowments and active investments in creativity; the costs and benefits of bringing creative activity to market determine the supply of creativity. Such an approach has been criticised for its view of creativity consumption as always having positive [[utility]], and for the way it analyses the value of future innovations.&lt;ref name="Diamond1992"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0732-118X(92)90023-S|last=Diamond|first=Arthur M.|title=Creativity and Interdisciplinarity: A Response to Rubenson and Runco|journal=New Ideas in Psychology|year=1992|volume=10|issue=2|pages=157–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[creative class]]'' is seen by some to be an important driver of modern economies. In his 2002 book, ''The Rise of the Creative Class'', [[economist]] [[Richard Florida]] popularized the notion that regions with "3 T's of economic development: Technology, Talent and Tolerance" also have high concentrations of [[creative professional]]s and tend to have a higher level of economic development.

==Fostering creativity==
{{Main|Creativity techniques}}

Several different researchers have proposed methods of increasing the creativity of an individual. Such ideas range from the [[Psychology|psychological]]-cognitive, such as [[Alex Faickney Osborn|Osborn]]-[[Sid Parnes|Parnes]] [[Creative_problem-solving|Creative Problem Solving Process]], [[Synectics]], science-based creative thinking, Purdue Creative Thinking Program, and [[Edward de Bono]]'s [[lateral thinking]]; to the highly structured, such as [[TRIZ]] (the Theory of Inventive Problem-Solving) and its variant Algorithm of Inventive Problem Solving (developed by the Russian scientist [[Genrich Altshuller]]), and Computer-Aided [[Morphological analysis (problem-solving)|morphological analysis]].

Daniel Pink, in his 2005 book ''A Whole New Mind'', repeating arguments posed throughout the 20th century, argues that we are entering a new age where creativity is becoming increasingly important. In this ''conceptual age'', we will need to foster and encourage ''right-directed thinking'' (representing creativity and emotion) over ''left-directed thinking'' (representing logical, analytical thought). However, this simplification of 'right' versus 'left' brain thinking is not supported by the research data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/lives-the-brain/201004/creativity-the-brain-and-evolution|title=Creativity, the Brain, and Evolution|website=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sternberg|chapter=Enhancing creativity|editor-link=Robert Sternberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides a summary of the various creativity techniques that have been proposed. These include approaches that have been developed by both academia and industry:
# Establishing purpose and intention
# Building basic skills
# Encouraging acquisitions of domain-specific knowledge
# Stimulating and rewarding curiosity and exploration
# Building motivation, especially internal motivation
# Encouraging confidence and a willingness to take risks
# Focusing on mastery and self-competition
# Promoting supportable beliefs about creativity
# Providing opportunities for choice and discovery
# Developing self-management (metacognitive skills)
# Teaching techniques and strategies for facilitating creative performance
# Providing balance

==Creativity and education policies==

Some see the conventional system of [[education|schooling]] as "stifling" of creativity and attempt (particularly in the [[preschool]]/[[kindergarten]] and early school years) to provide a creativity-friendly, rich, imagination-fostering environment for young children.&lt;ref name=Nickerson99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name="Csik99handbook"&gt;{{cite book|last=Csíkszentmihályi|first=Mihály|title=Handbook of Creativity|year=1999|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|editor=R. J. Sternberg|chapter=Implications of a systems perspective for the study of creativity|authorlink=Mihály Csíkszentmihályi|editor-link=Robert Sternberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RobAzzam2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robinson|first=K.|author2=Azzam, A. M.|title=Why creativity now?|journal=Educational Leadership|year=2009|volume=67|issue=1|pages=22–26|authorlink=Ken Robinson (British author)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have seen this as important because technology is advancing our society at an unprecedented rate and creative problem solving will be needed to cope with these challenges as they arise.&lt;ref name=RobAzzam2009 /&gt; In addition to helping with problem solving, creativity also helps students identify problems where others have failed to do so.&lt;ref name=Nickerson99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name= Csik99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paris, C., Edwards, N., Sheffield, E., Mutinsky, M., Olexa, T., Reilly, S., &amp; Baer, J.

New York, NY: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; See the Waldorf School as an example of an education program that promotes creative thought.

Promoting intrinsic motivation and problem solving are two areas where educators can foster creativity in students. Students are more creative when they see a task as intrinsically motivating, valued for its own sake.&lt;ref name=Csik99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name=RobAzzam2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name="ByrgeHanson2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Byrge|first=C.|author2=Hanson.

(1993). Evolution and flow. In M. Csikszentmihalyi (Ed.), The evolving self: A psychology for the third millennium (pp. 175–206). New York: Harper Perennial.&lt;/ref&gt; To promote creative thinking, educators need to identify what motivates their students and structure teaching around it. Providing students with a choice of activities to complete allows them to become more intrinsically motivated and therefore creative in completing the tasks.&lt;ref name=Nickerson99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Advisory Committee on Creative and Cultural Education (1998). All our futures: Creativity, culture, and education. UK: NACCCE&lt;/ref&gt;

Teaching students to solve problems that do not have well defined answers is another way to foster their creativity. This is accomplished by allowing students to explore problems and redefine them, possibly drawing on knowledge that at first may seem unrelated to the problem in order to solve it.&lt;ref name=Nickerson99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name=Csik99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name= RobAzzam2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ByrgeHanson2009 /&gt; In adults, mentoring individuals is another way to foster their creativiy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The manifesto : a guide to developing a creative career|last=Torrance|first=E.

===Scotland===
In the [[Education in Scotland|Scottish education system]], creativity is identified as a core skillset for learning, life and work and is defined as “a process which generates ideas that have value to the individual.  It involves looking at familiar things with a fresh eye, examining problems with an open mind, making connections, learning from mistakes and using imagination to explore new possibilities.” [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/practice-exemplars/Creativity%203-18%20curriculum%20review%20(impact%20report)] The need to develop a shared language and understanding of creativity and its role across every aspect of learning, teaching and continuous improvement was identified as a necessary aim [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/learning-resources/Creative%20Learning%20Networks] and a set of four skills is used to allow educators to discuss and develop creativity skills across all subjects and sectors of education – curiosity, open—mindedness, imagination and problem solving. [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/learning-resources/What%20are%20creativity%20skills?] Distinctions are made between creative learning (when learners are using their creativity skills), creative teaching (when educators are using their creativity skills) and creative change (when creativity skills are applied to planning and improvement). [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/documents/creativity/cre24_infographics/cre24-the-big-picture.pdf] Scotland’s national Creative Learning Plan [http://www.creativescotland.com/resources/our-publications/plans-and-strategy-documents/scotlands-creative-learning-plan-2013] supports the development of creativity skills in all learners and of educators’ expertise in developing creativity skills. A range of resources have been created to support and assess this [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/Pages/Search.aspx?k=Creativity%20infographics] including a national review of creativity across learning by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate for Education. [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/practice-exemplars/Creativity%203-18%20curriculum%20review%20(impact%20report)]

===United States===
Creativity has also been identified as one of the key [[21st century skills]] and as one of the  [[Four Cs of 21st century learning]] by educational leaders and theorists in the United States.

'''Curriculum and Instruction''' (C&amp;I) is a field within [[education]] which seeks to research, develop, and implement [[curriculum]] changes that increase student achievement within and outside schools. The field focuses on how students learn and the best ways to educate. It is also interested in new trends in teaching and learning process. It tries to find answers to questions such as "why to teach", "what to teach", "how to teach" and "how to evaluate" in instructional process. [[Master's degrees]] and [[doctorate]]s are offered at a number of [[universities]].

'''Discovery learning''' is a technique of [[inquiry-based learning]] and is considered a [[constructivism (learning theory)|constructivist]] based approach to education. It is also referred to as [[problem-based learning]], [[experiential learning]] and 21st century learning. It is supported by the work of learning theorists and psychologists [[Jean Piaget]], [[Jerome Bruner]], and [[Seymour Papert]]. Although this form of instruction has great popularity, there is some debate in the literature concerning its efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;(Mayer, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jerome Bruner]] is often credited with originating discovery learning in the 1960s, but his ideas are very similar to those of earlier writers such as [[John Dewey]].&lt;ref&gt;(Monroe, 1911)&lt;/ref&gt; Bruner argues that "Practice in discovering for oneself teaches one to acquire information in a way that makes that information more readily viable in problem solving".&lt;ref&gt;(Bruner, 1961, p.&amp;nbsp;26)&lt;/ref&gt; This philosophy later became the discovery learning movement of the 1960s. The mantra of this philosophical movement suggests that we should 'learn by doing'.

The label of discovery learning can cover a variety of instructional techniques.  According to a meta-analytic review conducted by Alfieri, Brooks, Aldrich, and Tenenbaum (2011), a discovery learning task can range from implicit pattern detection, to the elicitation of explanations and working through manuals to conducting simulations.  Discovery learning can occur whenever the student is not provided with an exact answer but rather the materials in order to find the answer themselves.

Discovery learning takes place in problem solving situations where the learner draws on his own experience and prior knowledge and is a method of instruction through which students interact with their environment by exploring and manipulating objects, wrestling with questions and controversies, or performing experiments.

==Characteristics==

Discovery-based learning is typically characterized by having minimal teacher guidance, fewer teacher explanations, solving problems with multiple solutions, use of hand-on materials, minimal repetition and memorization.&lt;ref&gt;(Stokke, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

There are multiple essential components that are required for successful discovery-based learning&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;(Dorier &amp; Garcia, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; which include the following:
*Teacher guidance where the emphasis is on building upon students’ reasoning and connecting to their experiences
*Classroom culture where there is a shared sense of purpose between teacher and students, where open-mindedness and dialogue are encouraged
*Students are encouraged to ask questions, inquire through exploration and collaborate with teacher and peers

==Teacher's role==

It has been suggested that effective teaching using discovery techniques requires teachers to do one or more of the following: 1) Provide guided tasks leveraging a variety of instructional techniques 2) Students should explain their own ideas and teachers should assess the accuracy of the idea and provide feedback 3) Teachers should provide examples of how to complete the tasks.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;(Alfieri, Brooks, Aldrich, &amp; Tenenbaum, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

A critical success factor to discovery learning is that it must be teacher assisted. Discovery learning can also result in students becoming confused and frustrated.&lt;ref&gt;(Kirschner, Sweller &amp; Clark, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Mayer (2004) argued that pure unassisted discovery should be eliminated due to the lack of evidence that it improves learning outcomes.  Even Bruner (1961) who was one of the early pioneers of discovery learning cautioned that discovery could not happen without some basic knowledge.

In summary, the teachers’ role in discovery learning is critical to the success of learning outcomes.  Students must build foundational knowledge through examples, practice and feedback.  This can provide a foundation for students to integrate additional information and build upon problem solving and critical thinking skills.

==Benefits==

Early research demonstrated that directed discovery had positive effects on retention of information at six weeks after instruction versus that of traditional direct instruction.&lt;ref&gt;(Ray, 1961)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed that the outcome of discovery based learning is the development of inquiring minds and the potential for life-long learning.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Discovery learning promotes student exploration and collaboration with teachers and peers to solve problems.  Children are also able to direct their own inquiry and be actively involved in the learning process which helps with student motivation.&lt;ref&gt;(Carroll &amp; Beman, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges, issues and alternatives==

A debate in the instructional community now questions the effectiveness of this model of instruction.&lt;ref&gt;(Kirschner, Sweller, &amp; Clark, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The debate dates back to the 1950s when researchers first began to compare the results of discovery learning to other forms of instruction.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; In support of the fundamental concept of discovery learning, Bruner (1961) suggested that students are more likely to remember concepts if they discover them on their own as opposed to those that are taught directly.

In pure discovery learning, the learner is required to discover new content through conducting investigations or carrying out procedures while receiving little, if any, assistance. "For example, a science teacher might provide students with a brief demonstration of how perceptions of color change depending on the intensity of the light source and then ask them to design their own experiment to further examine this relationship".{{attribution needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;(Marzano, 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;86)&lt;/ref&gt; In this example the student is left to discover the content on his/her own. Because students are left to self-discovery of topics, researchers worry that learning taking place may have errors, misconceptions or be confusing or frustrating to the learner.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;(Alfieri et al., 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Research shows that cognitive demands required for discovery in young children may hinder learning as they have limited amounts of existing knowledge to integrate additional information.  Bruner also cautioned that such discovery could not be made prior to or without at least some base of knowledge in the topic.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Students who are presented with problems without foundational knowledge may not have the ability to work though solutions.&lt;ref&gt;(Kirscher, Sweller &amp; Clark, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The meta-analyses conducted by Alfieri and colleagues reconfirmed such findings.

Mayer (2004) argues that unassisted discovery learning tasks do not help learners discover problem-solving rules, conservation strategies, or programming concepts. He does acknowledge, however that while under some circumstances constructivist-based approaches may be beneficial, pure discovery learning lacks structure in nature and hence will not be beneficial for the learner.  Mayer also points out that interest in discovery learning has waxed and waned since the 1960s. He argues that in each case the empirical literature has shown that the use of pure discovery methods is not suggested, yet time and time again researchers have renamed their instructional methods only to be discredited again, to rename their movement again.

Alternatively, direct ‘instruction where working examples, scaffolding techniques, explicit explanation and feedback are beneficial to learning (Alfieri, 2011).  In addition, time spent practising newly learned concepts improves problem solving skills (Pas and Van Gog, 2006).

There appears to be benefits to both direct instruction and assisted discovery. Perhaps finding the balance between the two instructional styles will lead to the best learning outcomes for students.

==In special needs education==

With the push for special needs students to take part in the general education curriculum, prominent researchers in this field doubt if general education classes rooted in discovery based learning can provide an adequate learning environment for special needs students.  Kauffman has related his concerns over the use of discovery based learning as opposed to direct instruction.  Kauffman comments, to be highly successful in learning the facts and skills they need, these facts and skills are taught directly rather than indirectly.  That is the teacher is in control of instruction, not the student, and information is given to students (2002).

This view is exceptionally strong when focusing on students with math disabilities and math instruction.  Fuchs ''et al.'' (2008) comment, &lt;blockquote&gt;
Typically developing students profit from the general education mathematics program, which relies, at least in part, on a constructivist, inductive instructional style.  Students who accrue serious mathematics deficits, however, fail to profit from those programs in a way that produces understanding of the structure, meaning, and operational requirements of mathematics&amp;nbsp;... Effective intervention for students with a math disability requires an explicit, didactic form of instruction&amp;nbsp;...
&lt;/blockquote&gt;Fuchs ''et al.'' go on to note that explicit or direct instruction should be followed up with instruction that anticipates misunderstanding and counters it with precise explanations.

However, few studies focus on the long-term results for direct instruction.  Long-term studies may find that direct instruction is not superior to other instructional methods.  For instance, a study found that in a group of fourth graders that were instructed for 10 weeks and measured for 17 weeks direct instruction did not lead to any stronger results in the long term than did practice alone.&lt;ref&gt;(Dean &amp; Kuhn, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;  Other researchers note that there is promising work being done in the field to incorporate constructivism and cooperative grouping so that curriculum and pedagogy can meet the needs of diverse learners in an inclusion setting.&lt;ref&gt;(Brantlinger, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it is questionable how successful these developed strategies are for student outcomes both initially and in the long term.

==Effects on cognitive load==

Research has been conducted over years&lt;ref&gt;(Mayer, 2001; Paas, Renkl, &amp; Sweller, 1999, 2004; Winn, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; to prove the unfavorable effects of discovery learning, specifically with beginning learners.  "Cognitive load theory suggests that the free exploration of a highly complex environment may generate a heavy working memory load that is detrimental to learning".&lt;ref&gt;(Kirschner, Sweller, Clark, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning learners do not have the necessary skills to integrate the new information with information they have learned in the past.  Sweller reported that a better alternative to discovery learning was guided instruction.  According to Kirschner, Sweller and Clark (2006), guided instruction produces more immediate recall of facts than unguided approaches along with longer term transfer and problem-solving skills.

==Enhanced discovery learning==

[[Robert J. Marzano]] (2011) describes enhanced discovery learning as a process that involves preparing the learner for the discovery learning task by providing the necessary knowledge needed to successfully complete said task. In this approach, the teacher not only provides the necessary knowledge required to complete the task, but also provides assistance during the task. This preparation of the learner and assistance may require some direct instruction. "For example,  before asking students to consider how best to stretch the hamstring muscle in cold weather, the teacher might present a series of lessons that clarify basic facts about muscles and their reaction to changes in temperature".&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;(Marzano, 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;87)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another aspect of enhanced discovery learning is allowing the learner to generate ideas about a topic along the way and then having students explain their thinking.&lt;ref&gt;(Marzano, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; A teacher who asks the students to generate their own strategy for solving a problem may be provided with examples in how to solve similar problems ahead of the discovery learning task.  "A student might come up to the front of the room to work through the first problem, sharing his or her thinking out loud. The teacher might question students and help them formulate their thinking into general guidelines for estimation, such as "start by estimating the sum of the highest place-value numbers". As others come to the front of the room to work their way through problems out loud, students can generate and test more rules".&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

==Relationship to academic performance==

Discovery-based instruction has been linked to the continual decline of Canadian students’ mathematic performance as indicated by international and provincial test scores (Stokke, 2015).  Discovery learning was introduced in the early 2000’s where the emphasis transitioned from direct to inquiry-based instruction.  Canada dropped six spots between 2003 and 2013 on the international PISA mathematics test and the province of Ontario had even deeper declines with a drop in eight spots (Huang, 2014).  The Education Quality and Accountability(EQAO) Ontario testing results for the 2016-2017 school year indicated that only 62% of primary and 50% of junior students meet the provincial mathematic standard (EQAO, 2017).  These scores have also declined since implementation of the program five years ago.

The '''Doctor of Audiology''' (Au.D.) is a professional degree for an [[audiologist]].  The Au.D. program is designed to produce audiologists who are skilled in providing diagnostic, rehabilitative, and other services associated with hearing, balance, tinnitus management, and related [[Audiology|audiological]] fields. These individuals help patients with hearing problems primarily by diagnosing hearing loss and fitting hearing assistive devices.
There is an emphasis on the clinical learning experience, though most programs also have a research component.  As of 2007, the Au.D. has replaced Masters-level audiology programs as the entry-level degree&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=AuD Facts |url=http://www.audiology.org/education_research/education/students/Pages/audfacts.aspx |work=American Academy of Audiology |year=2014 |accessdate=May 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the United States.  Other countries, such as Canada, still offer the master's degree. In the United States, after an Au.D. is obtained, some states may require a license before practicing audiology clinically.  The majority of Au.D. programs include three years of didactic and clinical instruction and a one year externship, similar to a medical residency. A few schools offer accelerated three-year programs. Programs differ in their prerequisite requirements for admission, though broadly applicants must have some background in the natural and social sciences, mathematics, and humanities. While it may be helpful for applicants to have a background in the communication sciences, this is not generally required for admission to an Au.D. program.

==History==
Before foreign influence, education in [[Micronesia]] was rarely distinguished from everyday life experiences and learning opportunities. Spanish influence during the 17th century changed the Micronesian learning experience to what happened at schools. This system was also influenced by German influence starting in 1899. The Japanese brought their strict model of education to [[Micronesia]] in 1914. Following [[World War II]], the United States brought their own model of education to Micronesia.&lt;ref name="Ballendorf 1974"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ballendorf |first1=Dirk Anthony |authorlink=Dirk Ballendorf |title=Coming Full Circle: A New School for Micronesia |journal=British Journal of Educational Technology |date=May 1974 |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=81–88 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8535.1974.tb00634.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Education in the [[Isle of Man]]''' is compulsory for children aged between 5 and 16. As a [[Crown dependency]] the Isle of Man parliament and government have competence over all domestic matters, including education; however the structure and curriculum are broadly in line with that of UK schools and particularly the [[National Curriculum for England|English national curriculum]]. Education is overseen by the [[Department of Education, Sport and Culture]] and regulated by the [[Isle of Man Education Act 2001]]. As of September 2017 there were 6,492 pupils in primary schools, and 5,218 pupils in secondary education.&lt;ref name="mediacentre" /&gt;

'''Educational inequality''' is the unequal distribution of academic resources, including but not limited to; school funding, qualified and experienced teachers, books, and technologies to socially excluded communities. These communities tend to be historically disadvantaged and oppressed. More times than not, individuals belonging to these [[Marginalized group|marginalized]] groups are also denied access to the schools with abundant resources. Inequality leads to major differences in the educational success or efficiency of these individuals and ultimately suppresses [[social mobility|social]] and [[economic mobility]]. ''See Statistic sections for more information.''

Measuring educational efficacy varies by country and even provinces/states within the country. Generally, grades, [[Grade point average|GPA]] scores, test scores, dropout rates, college entrance statistics, and college completion rates are used to measure educational success. These are measures of an individual's academic performance ability.  When determining what should be measured in terms of the educational success of an individual, many scholars and academics suggest that GPAs, test scores, and other measures of performance ability are not the only useful tools in determining efficacy.&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt; In addition to academic performance, attainment of learning objectives, acquisition of desired skills and competencies, satisfaction, persistence, and post-college performance should all be measured and accounted for when determining the educational success of individuals. Scholars argue that academic achievement is only the direct result of attaining learning objectives and acquiring desired skills and competencies. To accurately measure educational efficacy, it is imperative to separate academic achievement because it captures only a student's performance ability and not necessarily their learning or ability to effectively use what they have learned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=York, Rankin, &amp; Gibson|first=Travis T., Susan &amp; Charles|year=2015|title=Defining and Measuring Academic Success|url=|journal=Practical Assessment, Research &amp; Evaluation|volume= 20| issue = 5, March 2015|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of educational inequality is attributed to [[economic]] disparities that often falls along [[racial]] lines and much modern conversation about [[educational equity]] conflates the two, showing how they are inseparable from residential location and, more recently, language.&lt;ref name="Lee and Orfield"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Chungmei|author2=Gary Orfield|title=Why Segregation Matters: Poverty and Educational Inequality|journal=The Civil Rights Project|year=2005|series=Harvard University|pages=1–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Educational inequality between white students and minority students continues to perpetuate [[social inequality|social]] and [[economic inequality]].&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;Williams, Belinda, ed. [https://books.google.com/books?id=B4Aw038aah4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Closing the Achievement Gap: A Vision for Changing Beliefs and Practices]. 2nd ed. Alexandria, VA: Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the world, there have been continuous attempts to reform education at all levels.&lt;ref name="Haycock"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haycock|first=Kafi|title=Closing the Achievement Gap|journal=Helping All Students Achieve|year=2001|volume=58|pages=6–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; With different causes that are deeply rooted in history, society, and culture, this inequality is difficult to eradicate. Although difficult, education is vital to society's movement forward. It promotes "[[citizenship]], identity, equality of opportunity and social inclusion, social cohesion as well as economic growth and employment" and for these reasons, equality is widely promoted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shrivastava|first1=Meenal|last2=Shrivastava|first2=Sanjiv|title=Political economy of higher education: comparing South Africa to trends in the world|journal=Higher Education|date=June 2014|volume=67|issue=6|pages=809–822|doi=10.1007/s10734-013-9709-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unequal educational outcomes are attributed to several variables, including family of origin, gender, and social class. Achievement, earnings, health status, and political participation also contribute to [[Educational inequality in the United States|educational inequality within the United States]] and other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferreira|first1=Francisco|last2=Gignoux|first2=Jeremie|title=The Measurement of Educational Inequality: Achievement and Opportunity|journal=World Bank Economic Review|date=2014|volume=28|issue=2|pages=210–246|doi=10.1093/wber/lht004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family background==
In [[Harvard University|Harvard's]] "Civil Rights Project", Lee and Orfield identify family background as the most influential factor in student achievement.&lt;ref name="Lee and Orfield" /&gt; A correlation exists between the academic success of parents with the academic success of their children. Only 11% of children from the bottom fifth earn a college degree while 80% of the top fifth earn one.&lt;ref name="Haskins and Kemple"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haskins|first=Ron|author2=James Kemple|title=A New Goal for America's High Schools: College Preparation for All|journal=The Future of Children|year=2009|volume=19|pages=1–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Linked with resources, white students tend to have more educated parents than students from minority families.&lt;ref name="Gamoran"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gamoran|first=Adam|year=2001|title=American Schooling and Educational Inequality: A Forecast for the 21st Century|journal=Sociology of Education|volume=74|pages=135–153|doi=10.2307/2673258|jstor=2673258}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This translates to a home-life that is more supportive of educational success. This often leads to them receiving more at-home help, have more books in their home, attend more libraries, and engage in more intellectually intensive conversations.&lt;ref name=Gamoran /&gt; Children, then, enter school at different levels. Poor students are behind in verbal memory, vocabulary, math and reading achievement, and have more behavior problems.&lt;ref name=Greenstone /&gt;  This leads to their placement in different level classes that tracks them.&lt;ref name="Farkas"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Farkas|first=George|title=How Educational Inequality Develops|journal=National Poverty Center|year=2006|series=Working Paper Series|pages=1–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; These courses almost always demand less from their students, creating a group that is conditioned to lack educational drive.&lt;ref name=Haycock /&gt;  These courses are generally non-college bound and are taught by less qualified teachers.&lt;ref name=Williams /&gt;

Also, family background influences cultural knowledge and perceptions. [[Middle class]] knowledge of norms and customs allows students with this background to better navigate the school system.&lt;ref name=Gamoran /&gt;  Parents from this class and above also have social networks that prove to be more beneficial than networks based in lower classes. These connections may help students gain access to the right schools, activities, etc.&lt;ref name=Gamoran /&gt;  Additionally, children from poorer families, who are often minorities, come from families that distrust institutions.&lt;ref name=Gamoran /&gt; America's history of racism and discrimination has created a perceived and/or existent ceiling on opportunities for many poor and minority citizens. This ceiling muffles academic inspirations and muffles growth.&lt;ref name=Gamoran /&gt;

The recent and drastic increase of [[Latino]] immigrants has created another major factor in educational inequality. As more and more students come from families where [[English language|English]] is not spoken at home, they often struggle with overcoming a language barrier in addition to simply learning subjects.&lt;ref name="Lee and Orfield" /&gt;  They more frequently lack assistance at home because it is common for the parents to not understand the work that is in English.&lt;ref name=Farkas /&gt;

Furthermore, research reveals summer months as crucial time for the educational development of children. Students from disadvantaged families experience greater losses in skills during summer vacation.&lt;ref name=Greenstone /&gt;  Students from lower [[socioeconomic]] classes come disproportionately from single-parent homes and dangerous neighborhoods.&lt;ref name=Haycock /&gt; 15% of white children are raised in single-parent homes and 10% of Asian children are. 27% of Latinos are raised in single-parent homes and 54% of African American children are.&lt;ref name=Farkas /&gt; Less resources, less parental attention, and more stress all influence the performance of children in school.

==Gender==
{{see also|Sex differences in education}}
Throughout the world, educational achievement varies by gender.  The exact relationship differs across cultural and national contexts.

===Female disadvantage===
Obstacles preventing females' ability to receive a quality education include traditional attitudes towards [[gender roles]], poverty, [[geographical isolation]], [[gender-based violence]], and early marriage and pregnancy.&lt;ref name="UNESCO girls"&gt;{{cite web|title=Women and Girls Education|url=http://en.unesco.org/themes/women-and-girls-education|website=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the world, there is an estimated 7 million more girls than boys out of school. This  "girls gap" is concentrated in several countries including [[Somalia]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Togo]], the [[Central African Republic]] and [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, girls are outnumbered two to one.&lt;ref name="Learning Outcomes Africa"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ekine |first1=Adefunke |last2=Samati |first2=Madalo |last3=Walker |first3=Judith-Ann |title=Improving Learning Opportunities and Outcomes for Girls in Africa |url=http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Research/Files/Reports/2013/12/improving%20learning%20outcomes%20girls%20africa/WalkerEkineSamatiweb.pdf |website=Brookings Institution |accessdate=13 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129035541/http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Research/Files/Reports/2013/12/improving%20learning%20outcomes%20girls%20africa/WalkerEkineSamatiweb.pdf |archivedate=29 November 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Socialized gender roles affect females' access to education. For example, in [[Nigeria]], children are socialized into their specific gender role as soon as their parents know their gender. Men are the preferred gender and are encouraged to engage in [[Computer education|computer]] and scientific learning while the women learn domestic skills. These gender roles are deep rooted within the state, however, with the increase of westernized education within Nigeria, there has been a recent increase in women having the ability to receive an equal education. There is still much to be changed, though. Nigeria still needs policies that encourage educational attainment for men and women based on merit, rather than gender.&lt;ref name="Gender Equality in Nigeria"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Okonkowo|first1=Ejike|title=Attitude towards Gender Equality in South-eastern Nigerian Culture: Impact of Gender and Level of Education|journal=Gender &amp; Behavior|date=Dec 2013|volume=11|issue=2|pages=5579–5585}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Females are shown to be at risk of being attacked in at least 15 countries.&lt;ref name="Girls edu Brookings" /&gt; Attacks can occur because individuals within those countries do not believe women should receive an education. Attacks include kidnappings, bombings, torture, rape and murder. In [[Somalia]], girls have been abducted. In [[Colombia]], the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and [[Libya]] students were reported to have been raped and harassed.&lt;ref name="Girls edu Brookings" /&gt; In [[Pakistan]] and Afghanistan, schools and busses have been bombed and gassed.&lt;ref name="Girls edu Brookings" /&gt;

Early marriage affects females' ability to receive an education.

"The gap separating men and women in the job market remains wide in many countries, whether in the North or the South. With marginal variables between most countries, women have a lower employment rate, are unemployed longer, are paid less and have less secure jobs."&lt;ref name=Sharma&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sharma|first1=Geeta|title=Gender inequality in education and employment|url=http://yesweb.org/summit/sessions/op.inequality.doc}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Young women, particularly suffer double discrimination. First for being young, in the difficult phase of transition between training and working life, in an age group that has, on an average, twice the jobless rate or older workers and are at the mercy of employers who exploit them under the pretext of enabling them to acquire professional experience. Secondly they are discriminated against for being women and are more likely to be offered low paying or low status jobs."&lt;ref name=Sharma/&gt;  "Discrimination is still very much in evidence and education and training policies specially targeting young women are needed to restore a balance."&lt;ref name=Sharma/&gt; "Although young women are increasingly choosing typically 'male' professions, they remain over-represented in traditionally female jobs, such as [[secretaries]], [[nurses]], and under represented in jobs with responsibility and the professions."&lt;ref name=Sharma/&gt;

In early grades, boys and girls perform equally in [[mathematics]] and [[science]], but boys score higher on advanced mathematics assessments such as the SAT college entrance examination.&lt;ref name=Banks/&gt;  Girls are also less likely to participate in class discussions and more likely to be silent in the classroom.&lt;ref name=Banks/&gt;  Some believe that females have a way of thinking and learning that is different than males.  Belenky and colleagues (1986) conducted research which found that there was an inconsistency between the kind of knowledge appealing to women and the kind of knowledge being taught in most educational institutions.&lt;ref name=Banks/&gt; Another researcher, Gilligan (1982), found that the knowledge appealing to females was caring, interconnection, and sensitivity to the needs of others, while males found separation and individualism appealing.&lt;ref name=Banks/&gt;  Females are more field dependent, or group oriented, than males, which could explain why they may experience problems in schools that primarily teach using an individualistic learning environment.&lt;ref name=Banks/&gt;

===Male disadvantage===

In 51 countries, girls are enrolled at higher rates than boys. Particularly in [[Latin America]], the difference is attributed to prominence of gangs and violence attracting male youth. The gangs pull the males in, distracting them from school and causing them to drop out.&lt;ref name="Girls edu Brookings"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Winthrop|first1=Rebecca|last2=McGivney|first2=Eileen|title=Girls' Education Hotspots: A look at the Data|url=http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/education-plus-development/posts/2014/09/22-girls-education-winthrop|website=Brookings Institution|publisher=Brookings Institution|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries, female high school and graduation rates are higher than for males.&lt;ref name=Banks/&gt; In the United States for example, 33% more bachelor's degrees were conferred on females than males in 2010–2011.&lt;ref name="NCES"&gt;National Center for Education Statistics, [http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d12/tables/dt12_310.asp Digest of Education Statistics].  Retrieved 2017-09-09&lt;/ref&gt; This gap is projected to increase to 37% by 2021–2022, and is over 50% for master's and associate degrees. Dropout rates for males has also increased over the years in all racial groups, especially in [[African Americans]]. They have exceeded the number of high school and college dropout rates than any other racial ethnicity for the past 30 years.  A majority of the research found that males were primarily the most "left behind" in education because of higher graduation dropout rates, lower test scores, and failing grades. They found that as males get older, primarily from ages 9 to 17, they are less likely to be labeled "proficient" in reading and mathematics than girls were.

In general, males arrive in [[kindergarten]] much less ready and prepared for schooling than females. This creates a gap that continually increases over time into middle and high school. Nationally, there are 113 boys in 9th grade for every 100 girls, and among African American males, there are 123 boys for every 100 girls. States have discovered that 9th grade has become one of the biggest drop out years.&lt;ref name="Whitmire &amp; Bailey"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitmire|first1=Richard|last2=Bailey|first2=Susan|title=Gender Gap|url=http://educationnext.org/gender-gap/|website=Education Next}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Whitmire and Bailey continued their research and looked at the potential for any gender gap change when males and females were faced with the decision of potentially going to college. Females were more likely to go to college and receive bachelor's degrees than males were. From 1971 to about 1981, women were the less fortunate and had lower reported numbers of bachelor's degrees. However, since 1981, males have been at a larger disadvantage and the gap between males and females keeps increasing.&lt;ref name="Whitmire &amp; Bailey" /&gt;

Boys are more likely to be disciplined than girls, and are also more likely to be classified as [[learning disabled]].&lt;ref name=Banks/&gt; Males of color, especially African American males, experience a high rate of disciplinary actions and suspensions.  In 2012, one in five African American males received an out of school suspension.&lt;ref name=CRDC&gt;{{cite web|title=Civil Rights Data Collection(CRDC)|url=http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/crdc-2012-data-summary.pdf|website=Office for Civil Rights|accessdate=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Asia, males are expected to be the main financial contributor of the family. So many of them go to work right after they become adults physically, which means at the age around 15 to 17. This is the age they should obtain high school education.

Males get worse grades than females do regardless of year or country examined in most subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Voyer and Susan D.

== Race ==

=== United States ===
Race and ethnics have played a major role in the inequalities of the American Education system.

"Since its inception, public education in the United States has been beset with questions of which racial or ethnic group should be granted access to schooling."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lewis-Mccoy|first=R. L'Heureux|date=|title=Race and Education|url=|journal=Wiley-Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology|volume=2nd Edition|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 18th century in most states African-American students and Mexican American students were barred from attending schools with White Students. This was due to the post effects of the court case ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' (1896) where it was decided that educational facilities were allowed to segregate white students from students of color as long as the educational facilities were considered equal. Educational facilities did not follow the federal mandate, in a studies through taken from 1890 to 1950 of Southern States per pupil expenditures (1950s dollars) on instruction varied from Whites to Blacks. On average White students received 17–70 percent more educational expenditures than their Black counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Race and Schooling in the South, 1880–1950: An Economic History|last=Mago|first=Robert|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1990|isbn=0-226-50510-3|location=|pages=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Federal legal challenge of these unequal segregated educational systems would occur in California ''[[Mendez v. Westminster]]'' in 1947 followed by ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' in 1954. The decision of ''Brown v. Board of Education'' would lead to the desegregation of schools by federal law, but the years of lower education, segregation of household salaries between whites and people of color, and [[racial wealth gap]]s would leave people of color at a disadvantage to seek proper equal education for generations to come.

Differences of academic skills in children of different race starts at an early age, according to [[National Assessment of Educational Progress]] there is a remaining gap showing Black and Latino children being able to demonstrate cognitive proficiency compared to their White counterparts. In the data 89 percent of White children presented the ability to understand written and spoken words while only 79 and 78 percent of Black and Latino children were able to comprehend written and spoken words the trend would continue into ages 4–6.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Experts believe that the racial differences in academic achievement fall under three major categories: genetic, cultural, and structural. For example, in the 1980s minorities experienced a cultural phenomenon called "fear of acting White", minorities would shun and ridicule those in their social groups who had shown a higher intelligence than others. Shown in a graph comparing popularity to grade point average among Blacks, Latinos, and Whites  built based on data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health popularity of White students increased as their grades increased, for Black and Latino students popularity would drop as grades would rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://educationnext.org/actingwhite/|title="Acting White" – Education Next|date=2006-06-22|work=Education Next|access-date=2017-05-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Race and ethnics will continue to play a major role in the disbursement of education through the American public school system, through diversity placement programs such as [[Seizing Every Opportunity|SEO]] and [[Management Leadership for Tomorrow|MLT]], grants and social and cultural changes the education gap has slowly been closing between Whites and minorities in more recent years.

==Latino students and college preparednessess==
===Latino migration===

In the United States, Latinos are the largest growing population. As of July 1, 2016, Latinos make up 17.8 percent of the U.S. population, making them the largest minority.&lt;ref&gt;  U.S. Census Bureau. 2017. Annual Estimates of the Resident Population by Sex, Age, Race, and Hispanic Origin for the United States and States: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2016
&lt;/ref&gt; People from Latin America migrate to the United States due to their inability to obtain stability, whether it is financial stability or refugee. Their homeland is either dealing with an economic crisis or is involved in a war. The United States capitalizes on the migration of Latin American migrants. With the disadvantage of their legal status, American businesses employ them and pay them an extremely low wage.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, J. (2011). Harvest of Empire: A History of Latinos in America. New York, New York: Penguin Books.&lt;/ref&gt;  As 2013, 87% of undocumented men and 57% undocumented women were a part of the U.S. economy.&lt;ref&gt;Capps, R., Bachmeier, J. D., Fix, M., &amp; Van Hook, J. (2013). A demographic, socioeconomic,
and health coverage profile of unauthorized immigrants in the United
States. Washington, DC: Migration Policy Institute.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Diaspora plays a role in Latinos migrating to the United States. Diaspora is the dispersion of any group from their original homeland.&lt;ref&gt;Quayson, A. and Daswani, G. (2013) Introduction – Diaspora and Transnationalism, in A Companion to Diaspora and Transnationalism (eds A. Quayson and G. Daswani), Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Oxford, UK. doi: 10.1002/9781118320792.ch1
&lt;/ref&gt; New York City holds a substantial quota of the Latino population. More than 2.4 million Latinos inhabit New York City,&lt;ref name="NYC Planning"&gt;NYC Planning. 2017. Population Facts. Retrieved from https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/nyc-population/population-facts.page
&lt;/ref&gt; its largest Latino population being [[Puerto Ricans]] followed by Dominicans.&lt;ref name="NYC Planning"/&gt; The large number of Latinos contributes to the statistic of at least four million of United States born children having one immigrant parent.&lt;ref name=Bradeck&gt; Bradeck, K.M., Sibley, E., Lykes, M.B. (2016). Authorized and Unauthorized Immigrant Parents: The Impact of Legal Vulnerability on Family Contexts.  Hispanic Journal of Behavioral Sciences. 30 (1). 3–30. doi: 10.1 177/0739986315621741
&lt;/ref&gt;
Children of immigrant origin are the fastest growing population in the United States. One in every four children come from immigrant families.&lt;ref&gt; Hernandez, D.J, Denton, N.A., Macartney, S.E. (2008). Children in Immigrant Families: Looking to America's Future. Social Policy Report. &lt;/ref&gt; Many Latino communities are constructed around immigrant origins in which play a big part in society. The growth in children of immigrant parents does not go unaware, in a way society and the government accepts it. For example, many undocumented/immigrants can file taxes, children who attend college can provide parents information to obtain financial aid, parent(s) may be eligible for government help through the child, etc. Yet, the lack of knowledge regarding post-secondary education financial help increases the gap of Latino children to restrain from obtaining higher education.

===Education===

In New York City, Mayor De Balsio has implemented 3-K for All, which every child can attend pre-school at the age of three, free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, K. (2017, April 24) New York City Will Offer Free Preschool for All 3-Year-Olds. New York Times. Retrieved from https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/24/nyregion/de-blasio-pre-k-expansion.html
&lt;/ref&gt; Although children education is free from K-12 grade, many children with immigrant parents do not take advantage of all the primary education benefits. Children who come from a household that contains at least one immigrant parent, are less likely to attend childhood or preschool programs.&lt;ref name=Bradeck/&gt;

===College preparation===

The preparation of college access to children born in America from immigrant parents pertaining to Latino communities is a complex process. The beginning of junior year through senior year in high school consists of preparation to college research and application process. For government help towards college tuition such as Financial Aid and Taps, parents or guardian's personal information is needed, this is where doubt and anticipation unravels. Majority of immigrant parents/guardians do not have most of the qualifications required for the application. The focus is to portray the way immigrants and their American born child work around the education system to attain college education.
Due to the influx of the Latino population, there amount of Latino high school students graduates has increased as well.&lt;ref name="Snyder2012"&gt;Snyder, T. D., &amp; Dillow, S. A. (2012). Digest of education statistics 2011 (NCES 2012-001). Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Education.
&lt;/ref&gt; Latino students are mainly represented in two-year rather than four-year institutions.&lt;ref name="Snyder2012"/&gt; This can occur for two reasons: the cost reduction of attending a two-year institution or its close proximity to home.&lt;ref&gt;Mattern, K., &amp; Wyatt, J. (2009). Student choice of college: How far do students go for an education? Journal of College Admission, 203, 18–29.&lt;/ref&gt;
Young teens with desire to obtain a higher education clash with some limitations due to parent's/guardian's personal information.&lt;ref name=Bradeck/&gt; Many children lack public assistance due to lack of English proficiency of parents which is difficult to fill out forms or applications or simply due to the parent's fear of giving personal information that could identify their status, the same concept applies to Federal Student Aid. Federal Student Aid comes from the federal government in which helps a student pay for educational expenses of college in three possible formats, grant, work-study, and loan. One step of the Federal Aid application requires one or both parent/guardian personal information as well as financial information. This may limit the continuance of the application due to the fear of providing personal information. The chances of young teens entering college reduces when personal information from parents are not given.
Many young teens with immigrant parents are part of the minority group in which income is not sufficient to pay college tuition or repay loans with interest. The concept of college as highly expensive makes Latino students less likely to attend a four-year institution or even attend postsecondary education. Approximately 50% of Latinos received financial aid in 2003–2004, but they are still the minority who received the lowest average of federal award.&lt;ref name=Excelencia &gt; Excelencia in Education. (2005). How Latino students pay for college. Retrieved from https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED506050.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, loans are not typically granted to them.&lt;ref name=Excelencia/&gt;

===Standardized tests===

In addition to finance scarcity, standardized test are required when applying to a four-year post educational institution. In the United States, the two examinations that are normally taken are the SATs and ACTs. Latino students do generally take the exam, but from 2011 to 2015, there has been a 50% increase in the number of Latino students taking the ACTs.&lt;ref&gt;ACT. (2015). The Condition of College &amp; Career Readiness 2015: Hispanic Students. Retrieved from http://www.act.org/content/dam/act/unsecured/documents/06-24-16-Subcon-Hispanic-Report.pdf
&lt;/ref&gt; As for the SATs, in 2017, 24% of the test takers were identified with Latino/Hispanic. Out of that percentage, only 31 percent met the college-readiness benchmark for both portions of the test (ERW and Math).&lt;ref&gt;College Board. (2017). 2017 SAT Suite Annual Report Total Group.

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gifted and talented education==
There is a disproportionate percentage of middle and upper-class White students labeled as [[Gifted student|gifted]] and talented compared to lower-class, minority students.&lt;ref name=Banks&gt;{{cite book|last1=Banks|first1=James|title=Multicultural Education: Issues and Perspectives|date=2013|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|chapter=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, [[Asian American]] students have been over-represented in gifted education programs.&lt;ref name=Ford&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ford|first1=Donna|title=The Underrepresentation of Minority Students in Gifted Education: Problems and Promises in Recruitment and Retention|journal=The Journal of Special Education|date=1998|volume=32|issue=1|pages=4–14|doi=10.1177/002246699803200102}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1992, African Americans were underrepresented in gifted education by 41%, Hispanic American students by 42%, and [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] by 50%.  Conversely, White students were over-represented in gifted education programs by 17% and Asian American minority students being labeled as gifted and talented, but research shows that there is a growing [[racial achievement gap in the United States|achievement gap between white students and students of color]].  There is also a growing gap between gifted students from low-income background and higher-income background.&lt;ref name=NAGC&gt;{{cite web|title=Including diverse learners in gifted education programs and services|url=http://www.nagc.org/resources-publications/resources/timely-topics/including-diverse-learners-gifted-education-programs|website=National Association for Gifted Children|accessdate=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The reasons for the under-representation of African American, Hispanic American, and American Indian students in gifted and talented programs can be explained by (a) recruitment issues/screening and identifying; and (b) personnel issues.&lt;ref name=Ford /&gt;  In regards to screening and identifying gifted and talented students, most states use a standardized achievement and aptitude test, which minority students have a history of performing poorly on.  Arguments against standardized tests claim that they are culturally biased, favoring White students, require a certain mastery of the English language, and can lack cultural sensitivity in terms of format and presentation.&lt;ref name=Ford /&gt;  In regards to personnel issues, forty-six states use teacher nominations, but many teachers are not trained in identifying or teaching gifted students.  Teachers also tend to have lower expectations of minority students, even if they are identified as gifted.  Forty-five states allow for parental nominations, but the nomination form is not sensitive to cultural differences and minority parents can have difficulty understanding the form. Forty-two states allow self nomination, but minority students tend not to self nominate because of social-emotional variables like peer pressure or feeling isolated or rejected by peers.&lt;ref name=Ford /&gt;  Additionally, some students are identified as gifted and talented simply because they have parents with the knowledge, political skills, and power to require schools to classify their child as gifted and talented.  Therefore, providing their child with special instruction and enrichment.&lt;ref name=Banks/&gt;  Schools should make sure that students from all social-class, cultural, language, and ethnic groups have an equal opportunity to participate in gifted and talented programs.&lt;ref name=Banks/&gt;

===Recommendations===
There are many recommendations for recruiting and retaining minority students in gifted and talented education programs.  It is important that the instruments used to screen students are valid, reliable, and sensitive to students from diverse cultural backgrounds.  There should also be multiple types ([[quantitative research|quantitative]], [[qualitative research|qualitative]], [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]], [[subjectivity|subjective]]) and sources (teachers, parents, students) of information used in the screening process.&lt;ref name=Ford /&gt;  Minority students who come from less rigorous schools and classrooms should be provided with support services and educational opportunities to help them be successful.  An example would be classes that focus on study skills or time management skills.&lt;ref name=Ford /&gt;  Teachers should attend professional development opportunities and be trained in teaching and working with minority students.  More specifically, teachers should attend professional development that addresses the characteristics and behaviors of underrepresented gifted populations, awareness of cultural differences, children with multiple exceptionalities, developing positive peer culture in the classroom and school, and equitable and unbiased assessments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Classroom Instruction and Teacher Training for Gifted Students from Diverse Populations|url=http://www.nagc.org/resources-publications/resources/timely-topics/ensuring-diverse-learner-participation-gifted-1|website=National Association for Gifted Children|accessdate=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There should also be an increase in family involvement in the classroom and school, along with family involvement in the screening process.&lt;ref name=Ford /&gt; It is important to implement programs to keep students in school as they come of age and need to work so they can provide for their family. These programs should help students stay in school and provide a path to a career instead of having to go to work when they are old enough, which is a major barrier students of low income families face.

==Special education==
In addition to the unbalanced scale of gender disproportionality in formal education, students with "[[special needs]]" comprise yet another facet of educational inequality.  Prior to the 1975 passing of the [[Education for All Handicapped Children Act]] (currently known as the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA)) approximately 2 million children with special needs were not receiving sufficient public education.  Of those that were within the academic system, many were reduced to lower standards of teaching, isolated conditions, or even removal from school buildings altogether and relocated out of peer circulation.&lt;ref name=Losen&gt;{{cite book|last1=Losen|first1=Daniel J|last2=Orfield|first2=Gary|title=Racial Inequality in Special Education|date=2002|publisher=Harvard Education Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The passing of this bill effectively changed the lives of millions of special needs students, ensuring that they have free access to quality public education facilities and services.  And while there are those that benefit from the turning of this academic tide, there are still many students (most of which are minorities with disabilities) that find themselves in times of learning hardship due to the unbalanced distribution of special education funding.

In 1998 1.5 million minority children were identified with special learning needs in the US, out of that 876,000 were [[African Americans|African American]] or [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]].  [[African Americans|African American]] students were 3 times as likely to be labeled as special needs than that of [[White people|Caucasians]].  Students who both are special education students and of a minority face unequal chances for a quality education to meet their personal needs.  Special education referrals are, in most cases in the hands of the general education teacher, this is subjective and because of differences, disabilities can be overlooked or unrecognized.  Poorly trained teachers at minority schools, poor school relationships, and poor parent-to-teacher relationships play a role in this inequality.  With these factors, minority students are at a disadvantage because they are not given the appropriate resources that would in turn benefit their educational needs.&lt;ref name=Losen /&gt;

[[US Department of Education]] data shows that in 2000–2001 at least 13 states exhibited more than 2.75% of African American students enrolled in public schools with the label of "[[mental retardation]]". At that time national averages of caucasians labeled with the same moniker came in at 0.75%.  During this period no Individual state rose over 2.32% of caucasian students with special needs.&lt;ref name=Losen /&gt;

According to Tom Parrish, a senior research analyst with the [[American Institutes for Research]], African American children are 2.88 times more likely to be labeled as "mentally retarded", and 1.92 times more likely to be labeled as emotionally disturbed than Caucasian children.  This information was calculated by data gathered from the [[United States Department of Education|US Department of Education]].&lt;ref name=Losen /&gt;  It illustrates how even within a system that has progressed so much over the years, specifically due to industry recognition and public attention in forms such as government and private funding, aspects as archaic as race discrimination are still prevalent within these institutional walls.

Researchers Edward Fierros and [[James Conroy (researcher)|James Conroy]], in their study of district level data regarding the issue of minority over-representation, have suggested that many states may be mistaken with their current projections and that disturbing minority based trends may be hidden within the numbers.  According to the Individuals with [[Disability discrimination act|Disabilities Act]] students with special needs are entitled to facilities and support that cater to their individual needs, they should not be automatically isolated from their peers or from the benefits of general education.  However, according to Fierros and Conroy, once minority children such as African Americans and Latinos are labeled as students with special needs they are far less likely than caucasians to be placed in settings of inclusive learning and often receive less desirable treatment overall.&lt;ref name=Losen /&gt;

This problem of [[racial segregation]] amongst minority students with special needs is an ongoing battle in need of resolution.  While historically there has been no ironclad solution to righting the wrongs of racial prejudices, there are ways in which we can all individually begin the process of equality within our educational institutions.  Organizations such as the US Department of Education provide resources that we as teachers, students, parents, and concerned individuals can utilize in order to better educate ourselves on the current issues and services regarding special needs education.  One such resource is the [[Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services|Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS)]] which provides links to currently debated topics, programs, initiatives, reports and resources as well support services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services|url=http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/osers/osep/index.html|website=US Department of Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of educational oppression ==

===United States of America (US)===
{{main|Educational inequality in the United States}}
The historical relationships in the United States between privileged and marginalized communities' play a major role in the administering of unequal and inadequate education to these socially excluded communities. The belief that certain communities in the United States were inferior in comparison to others has allowed these disadvantages to foster into the great magnitude of educational inequality that we see apparent today.

For African Americans, deliberate systematic education oppression date back to enslavement, more specifically 1740. In 1740, North Carolina passed legislature that prohibited [[Education during the Slave Period|slave education]]. While the original legislature prohibited African Americans from being taught how to write, as other States adopted their own versions of the law, southern anti-literacy legislatures banned far more than just writing. Varying Southern laws prohibited African Americans from learn how to read, write, and assembling without the presence of slave owners. Many states as far as requiring free African Americans to leave in fear of them educating their enslaved brethren. By 1836, the public education of all African-Americans was strictly prohibited.

The enslavement of African Americans removed the access to education for generations.&lt;ref name="Ladson-Billings"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ladson-Billings|first=Gloria|year=2006|title=From Achievement Gap to the Education Debt: Understanding Achievement in U.S. Schools|journal=Educational Researcher|volume=35|issue=7|series=AERA Presidential Address|pages=1–11|doi=10.3102/0013189x035007003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Once the legal abolishment of slavery was enacted, racial stigma remained. Social, economic, and political barriers held blacks in a position of subordination.&lt;ref name="Gamoran" /&gt; Although legally African Americans had the ability to be learning how to read and write, they were often prohibited from attending schools with White students. This form of segregation is often referred to as ''de jure'' segregation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The schools that allowed African American students to attend often lacked financial support, thus providing inadequate educational skills for their students. Freedmen's schools existed but they focused on maintaining African Americans in servitude, not an enriching academic prosperity.&lt;ref name="Ladson-Billings" /&gt;  The United States then experienced legal separation in schools between whites and blacks. Schools were supposed to receive equal resources but there was an undoubted inequality. It was not until 1968 that Black students in the South had universal secondary education.&lt;ref name="Ladson-Billings" /&gt; Research reveals that there was a shrinking of [[racial achievement gap in the United States|inequality between racial groups]] from 1970–1988, but since then the gap has grown again.&lt;ref name="Williams" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ladson-Billings" /&gt;

Latinos and American Indians experienced similar educational repression in the past, which effects are evident now. Latinos have been systematically shut out of educational opportunities at all levels. Evidence suggests that Latinos have experienced this educational repression in the United States has far back as 1848.&lt;ref name="Ladson-Billings" /&gt; Despite the fact that it is illegal to not accept students based on their race, religion, or ethnicity, in the Southwest of the United States Latinos were often segregated through the deliberate practice of school and public officials. This form of segregation is referred to as de facto segregation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fox-Williams, Lewis-McCoy|first=Brittany N., R. L’Heureux|year=2016|title=Race and Education|url=|journal=Wiley-Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology|volume=2nd Edition|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; American Indians experienced the enforcement of [[missionary schools]] that emphasized the [[Assimilation (sociology)|assimilation]] into white culture and society. Even after "successful" assimilation, those American Indians experienced discrimination in white society and often a rejection by their tribe.&lt;ref name="Ladson-Billings" /&gt; It created a group that could not truly benefit even if they gained an equal education.

American universities are separated into various classes, with a few institutions, such as the [[Ivy League]] schools, much more exclusive than the others.  Among these exclusive institutions, educational inequality is extreme, with only 6% and 3% of their students coming from the bottom two income quintiles.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Mishel, Jared Bernstein, and Heidi Shierholz, The State of Working America 2008/ 2009 (Ithaca, NY: ILR Press)cited in Stiglitz, Joseph E. (2012-06-04). The Price of Inequality: How Today's Divided Society Endangers Our Future (p. 308). Norton. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Resources ===
Access to resources play an important role in educational inequality. In addition to the resources from family mentioned earlier, access to proper nutrition and health care influence the cognitive development of children.&lt;ref name=Greenstone /&gt; Children who come from poor families experience this inequality, which puts them at a disadvantage from the start. Not only important are resources students may or may not receive from family, but schools themselves vary greatly in the resources they give their students. On December 2, 2011, the [[U.S. Department of Education]] released that school districts are unevenly distributing funds, which are disproportionately underfunding low-income students.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2011/12/educational_inequality.html|title=The Persistence of Educational Inequality|last=Brown|first=Cynthia G.|work=Center for American Progress|accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is holding back money from the schools that are in great need. High poverty schools have less-qualified teachers with a much higher turnover rate.&lt;ref name="Lee and Orfield" /&gt;  In every subject area, students in high poverty schools are more likely than other students to be taught by teachers without even a minor in their subject matter.&lt;ref name=Haycock /&gt; Better resources allows for the reduction of classroom size, which research has proven improves test scores.&lt;ref name=Greenstone /&gt; It also increases the number of after school and summer programs—these are very beneficial to poor children because it not only combats the increased loss of skill over the summer but keeps them out of unsafe neighborhoods and combats the drop-out rate.&lt;ref name=Greenstone /&gt;  There is also a difference in the classes offered to students, specifically advanced mathematics and science courses.  In 2012, Algebra II was offered to 82% of the schools (in diverse districts) serving the fewest Hispanic and African American students,  while only 65% of the schools serving the most African American and Hispanic students offered students the same course.  [[Physics]] was offered to 66% of the schools serving the fewest Hispanic and African American students, compared to 40% serving the most.  [[Calculus]] was offered to 55% of the schools serving the fewest Hispanic and African American students, compared to 29% serving the most.&lt;ref name=CRDC /&gt;

This lack of resources is directly linked to ethnicity and race. Black and Latino students are three times more likely than whites to be in high poverty schools and twelve times as likely to be in schools that are predominantly poor.&lt;ref name="Lee and Orfield" /&gt;  Also, in schools that are composed of 90% or above of minorities, only one half of the teachers are certified in the subjects they teach.&lt;ref name=Haycock /&gt;  As the number of white students increase in a school, funding tends to increase as well.&lt;ref name=Ladson-Billings /&gt;  Teachers in elementary schools serving the most Hispanic and African-American students are paid on average $2250 less per year than their colleagues in the same district working at schools serving the fewest Hispanic and African American Students.&lt;ref name=CRDC /&gt; From the family resources side, 10% of white children are raised in poverty, while 37% of Latino children are and 42% of African American children are.&lt;ref name=Farkas /&gt; Research indicates that when resources are equal, Black students are more likely to continue their education into college than their white counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Merolla|first=David|year=2013|title=The Net Black Advantage in Educational Transitions: An Educational Careers Approach|url=http://aer.sagepub.com/content/50/5/895|journal=American Educational Research Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===State conflicts===
Within [[fragile state]]s, children may be subject to inadequate education. The poor educational quality within these states is believed to be a result of four main challenges. These challenges include coordination gaps between the governmental actors, the policy maker's low priority on [[educational policy]], limited financing, and lack of educational quality.&lt;ref name="Fragile States"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Winthrop |first1=Rebecca |last2=Matsui |first2=Elena |title=A New Agenda for Education in Fragile States |url=http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Research/Files/Papers/2013/08/education%20agenda%20fragile%20states%20winthrop/08%20education%20agenda%20fragile%20states%20winthrop.pdf |website=Brookings Institution |publisher=Brookings Institution |accessdate=11 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129035458/http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Research/Files/Papers/2013/08/education%20agenda%20fragile%20states%20winthrop/08%20education%20agenda%20fragile%20states%20winthrop.pdf |archivedate=29 November 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==
In the last decade, tests have been administered throughout the world to gather information about students, the schools they attend, and their educational achievements. These tests include the [[Organization for Economic and Co-Operational Development]]'s Program of International Student Assessment and the [[International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement]]'s Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study. To calculate the different test parameters in each country and calculate a standard score, the scores of these tests are put through [[Item Response Theory]] models. Once standardized, analysts can begin looking at education through the lens of achievement rather than looking at attainment. Through looking at achievement, the analysts can objectively examine educational inequality throughout the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferreira|first1=Francisco|last2=Jeremie|first2=Gignoux|title=Measurement of Educational Inequality: Achievement and Opportunity|journal=World Bank Economic Review|date=2014|volume=28|issue=2|pages=210–246|doi=10.1093/wber/lht004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects ==
{{hatnote|See selected issues under [[Higher education in the United States]].}}

=== Social mobility ===
''[[Social mobility]]'' refers to the movement in class status from one generation to another. It is related to the "rags to riches" notion that anyone, with hard work and determination, has the ability to move upward no matter what background they come from. Contrary to that notion, however, sociologists and economists have concluded that, although exceptions are heard of, social mobility has remained stagnant and even decreased over the past thirty years.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Leonhardt, D. &amp; Scott, J. (2005). Class matters: Shadowy lines that still divide. New York Times. https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/15/national/class/OVERVIEW-FINAL.html&lt;/ref&gt;   From 1979 through 2007 the wage income for lower and middle class citizens has risen by less than 17 percent while the one percent has grown by approximately 156 percent sharply contrasting the "postwar period up through the 1970s, when income growth was broadly shared".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stateofworkingamerica.org/subjects/overview/?reader|title=Overview {{!}} State of Working America|website=www.stateofworkingamerica.org|accessdate=2015-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the decrease in social mobility may be explained by the stratified educational system. Research has shown that since 1973, men and women with at least a college degree have seen an increase in hourly wages, while the wages for those with less than a college degree have remained stagnant or have decreased during the same period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stateofworkingamerica.org/subjects/wages/?reader|title=Wages {{!}} State of Working America|website=www.stateofworkingamerica.org|accessdate=2015-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the educational system forces low-income families to place their children into less-than-ideal school systems, those children are typically not presented with the same opportunities and educational motivation as are students from well-off families, resulting in patterns of repeated intergenerational educational choices for parent and child, also known as decreased or stagnant [[social mobility]].&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

== Remedies ==
There are a variety of efforts by countries to assist in increasing the availability of quality education for all children.

===Assessment===
Based on input from more than 1,700 individuals in 118 countries, [[UNESCO]] and the [[Center for Universal Education]] at the [[Brookings Institution]] have co-convened the Learning Metrics Task Force.&lt;ref name="Brookings Assessments" /&gt; The task force aims to shift the focus from access to access plus learning.&lt;ref name="Brookings Assessments" /&gt; They discovered through assessment, the learning and progress of students in individual countries can be measured.&lt;ref name="Brookings Assessments" /&gt; Through the testing, governments can assess the quality of their education programs, refine the areas that need improvement, and ultimately increase their student's success.&lt;ref name="Brookings Assessments"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/reports/2014/07/implementing-assessment-improve-learning|title=Toward Universal Learning: Implementing Assessment to Improve Learning|date=15 July 2014|website=Brookings Institution|publisher=Brookings Institution and UNESCO Institute for Statistics|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education for All Act===
The [[Education For All]] act or EFA is a global commitment to provide quality basic education for all children, youth, and adults. In 2000, 164 governments pledged to achieve education for all at the [[World Education Forum]]. There are six decided-upon goals designed to reach the goal of Education for All by 2015. The entities working together to achieve these goals include governments, multilateral and development agencies, civil society and the private sector. [[UNESCO]] is responsible for coordinating the partnerships. Although progress has been made, some countries are providing more support than others. Also, there is need to strengthen overall political commitment as well as strengthening the needed resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|title=Coordination and Advocacy for EFA|url=https://en.unesco.org/partnerships/partnering/coordination-and-advocacy-efa|website=United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global Partnership for Education===
[[Global Partnership for Education]] or GPE functions to create a global effort to reduce educational inequality with a focus on the poorest countries. GPE is the only international effort with their particular focus on supporting countries' efforts to educate their youth from primary through secondary education. Main goals of the partnership include providing educational access to each child, ensuring each child masters basic numeracy and literacy skills, increasing the ability for governments to provide quality education for all, and providing a safe space for all children to learn in. They are a partnership of donor and developing countries but the developing countries shape their own educational strategy based upon their personal priorities. When constructing these priorities, GPE serves to support and facilitate access to financial and technical resources. Successes of GPE include helping nearly 22 million children get to school, equipping 52,600 classrooms and training 300,000 teachers.&lt;ref name="Global Partnership for Education"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.globalpartnership.org/10-things|title=10 Things About The Global Partnership|website=The Global Partnership for Education|publisher=Global Partnership for Education|accessdate=3 November 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140404015527/https://www.globalpartnership.org/10-things|archivedate=2014-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Massive online classes===
There is a growing shift away from traditional higher education institutions to [[massive open online courses]] (MOOC). These classes are run through content sharing, videos, online forums and exams. The MOOCs are free which allow for many more students to take part in the classes, however the programs are created by global north countries, therefore inhibiting individuals in the global south from creating their own innovations.&lt;ref name="Inequality South Africa" /&gt;

== Policy implications ==

With the knowledge that early educational intervention programs, such as extended childcare during preschool years, can significantly prepare low-income students for educational and life successes, comes a certain degree of responsibility. One policy change that seems necessary to make is that quality child care is available to every child in the United States at an affordable rate. This has been scientifically proven to push students into college, and thus increase [[social mobility]]. The ultimate end result of such a reality would be that the widely stratified educational system that exists in the U.S. today would begin to equalize so that every child born, regardless of [[socioeconomic status]], would have the same opportunity to succeed. Many European countries are already exercising such successful educational systems.

=== Albania ===
Household income in Albania is very low. Many families are unable to provide a college education for their kids, with the money they make. Albania is one of the poorest countries in Europe with a large population of people under the age of 25. This population of students needs a path to higher education. Nothing is being done for all the young adults who are smart enough to go to college but can not afford to.

===Bangladesh===
{{Main article|Education in Bangladesh}}
The [[Bangladesh]] education system includes more than 100,000 schools run by public, private, NGO and religious providers.&lt;ref name="Ed Bangladesh" /&gt; The schools are overseen by a national ministry. Their system is centralized and overseen by the sub districts also known as [[Upazilas of Bangladesh|Upazilas]].&lt;ref name="Ed Bangladesh" /&gt; During the past two decades, the system expanded through new national policies and pro-poor spending. The gross enrollment rate in the poorest quintile of [[Upazilas of Bangladesh|upazilas]] is 101 percent.&lt;ref name="Ed Bangladesh" /&gt; Also, the poorest quintile spending per child was 30 percent higher than the wealthiest quintile.&lt;ref name="Ed Bangladesh"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Steer|first1=Liesbet|last2=Rabbani|first2=Fazle|last3=Parker|first3=Adam|title=Primary Education Finance for Equity and Quality: An Analysis of Past Success and Future Options in Bangladesh|url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2014/09/primary-education-finance-equity-quality|website=Brookings Institution|publisher=Brookings Institution|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Educational inequalities continue despite the increased spending. They do not have consistent learning outcomes across the upazilas. In almost 2/3 of upazilas, the dropout rate is over 30 percent.&lt;ref name="Ed Bangladesh" /&gt; They have difficulty acquiring quality teachers and 97 percent of preprimary and primary students are in overcrowded classrooms.&lt;ref name="Ed Bangladesh" /&gt;

===South Africa===
{{Main article|Education in South Africa}}

==== Inequality in higher education ====
Africa, in general, has suffered from decreased spending on higher education programs. As a result, they are unable to obtain moderate to high enrollment and there is minimal research output.&lt;ref name="Inequality South Africa"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shrivastava|first1=Meenal|last2=Shrivastava|first2=Sanjiv|title=Political economy of higher education: comparing South Africa to trends in the world|journal=Higher Education|date=June 2014|volume=64|issue=6|pages=809–822|doi=10.1007/s10734-013-9709-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within [[South Africa]], there are numerous factors that effect the quality of tertiary education. The country inherited class, race and gender inequality in the social, political, and economic spheres during the [[Apartheid]]. The 1994 constitution emphasizes higher education as useful for human resource development and of great importance to any economic and social transitions. However, they are still fighting to overcome the [[colonialism]] and racism in intellectual spaces.&lt;ref name="Inequality South Africa" /&gt;

Funding from the government has a major stake in the educational quality received. As a result of declining government support, the average class size in South Africa is growing. The increased class size limits student-teacher interactions, therefore further hindering students with low problem solving and critical thinking skills. In an article by Meenal Shrivastava and Sanjiv Shrivastava, the argument is made that in large class sizes “have ramifications for developing countries where higher education where higher education is a core element in the economic and societal development”. These ramifications are shown to include lower student performance and information retention.&lt;ref name="Inequality South Africa" /&gt;

=== United Kingdom (UK) ===

Evidence from the [[British birth cohort studies]] has illustrated the powerful influence of family socio-economic background on children's educational attainment. These differences emerge early in childhood,&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, A., Ketende, S., &amp; Joshi, H. (2013). Social Class and Inequalities in Early Cognitive Scores. Sociology..&lt;/ref&gt; and continue to grow throughout the school years.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein, L. (2003). Inequality in the early cognitive development of British children in the 1970 cohort. Economica, 70(277), 73–97.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sudan Republic (SD) ===

The earliest educational system of Sudan was established by the British during the first half of the 20th century. The government of Sudan recognizes education as a right for every citizen and guarantees access to free basic education, The educational structure of the Republic of the Sudan consists of the pre-primary, primary, secondary and higher education, The Sudanese education system includes more than 3.646 schools run by public, private, and religious providers, the schools are overseen by the High Ministry of Education. However, Sudan’s simmering wars and a lack of awareness about the importance of education and chronic under-development all contribute to the poor schooling of girls in Sudan. In addition, cultural pressures and the traditional views of the role of women mean fewer girls attend and remain in school. The inability to pay fees even though school is free according to government policy is a major reason, some poor families can’t afford the stationaries &amp; clothes, also the government can’t provide all the students needs because of the economic situation and poverty. However government has raised their awareness of educating females, and they published universities only for girls, the first and the most popular one is AL Ahfad University for Women, located in Omdurman, created in 1907 by Sheikh Babikr Bedri. now percentage of educated females are increasing within time, based on the last survey estimates that 60.8% of females in Sudan can read &amp; write.

=== United States of America (US) ===
''See selected issues and criticisms under [[Higher education in the United States]].''[[File:Children in a classroom.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Children in a classroom in the United States.|Children in a classroom in the United States]]

====Property tax dilemma====
In the United States, schools are funded by local property taxes.  Because of this, the more affluent a neighborhood, the higher the funding for that school district. Although this situation seems favorable, the problem emerges when the equation is reversed. In neighborhoods inhabited by predominantly working and lower-class families, properties are less expensive, and so property taxes are much lower than those in affluent neighborhoods. Consequently, funding for the school districts to which working and lower class children are assigned is also significantly lower than the funding for the school districts to which children of affluent families are assigned. Thus, students in working and lower class schools do not receive the same quality of education and access to resources as do students from affluent families. The reality of the situation is that distribution of resources for schools is based on the socioeconomic status of the parents of the students. As a result, the U.S. educational system significantly aids in widening the gap between the rich and the poor. This gap has increased, rather than decreased, over the past few decades due in part to a lack of [[social mobility]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Leonhardt, D. (2005). Class matters: The college dropout boom. New York Times. https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/24/national/class/EDUCATION-FINAL.html?_r=1&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International comparisons ===
Compared to other nations, the United States is among some of the highest spenders on education per student behind only Switzerland and Norway.&lt;ref name="Spellings"&gt;Spellings, Margaret. "10 Facts About K-12 Education Funding". ED.gov. June 2005. U.S. Department of Education. 28 Nov 2011 http://www2.ed.gov/about/overview/fed/10facts/index.html.&lt;/ref&gt; The per-pupil spending has even increased in recent years{{when|date=April 2018}} but the academic achievement of students has remained stagnant.&lt;ref name=Greenstone&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greenstone|first=Michael|title=Improving Student Outcomes: Restoring America's Education Potential|journal=The Hamilton Project|year=2011|series=Strategy Paper|pages=1–30|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Education in Sweden|Swedish educational system]] is one such system that attempts to equalize students and make sure every child has an equal chance to learn. Some ways that Sweden is accomplishing these goals is by making sure every child can go to daycare affordably. Of the total cost of childcare, parents pay no more than 18% for their child; the remaining 82% is paid for by various government agencies and municipalities. In 2002, a "maximum-fee" system was introduced in Sweden that states that costs for childcare may be no greater than 3% of one's income for the first child, 2% for the second child, 1% for the third child, and free of charge for the fourth child in pre-school. 97.5% of children age 1–5 attend these public daycare centers. Also, a new law was recently introduced that states that all four- and five-year-old children can attend day care for free.&lt;ref name="auto6"&gt;Bjornberg, U. &amp; Dahlgren, L. Policy: The case of Sweden. University of York, United Kingdom. http://www.york.ac.uk/inst/spru/research/nordic/swedenpoli.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Since practically all students, no matter what their socioeconomic background, attend the same daycare centers, equalization alongside educational development begins early and in the public sphere. Furthermore, parental leave consists of 12 months paid leave (80% of wage) whereas one month is awarded solely to the father in the form of "use it or lose it". This results in the privilege and affordability of staying home and bonding with one's child for the first year of life. Due to this affordability, less than 200 children in the entire country of Sweden under the age of 1 are placed in child care.&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;Clawson, D. &amp; Gerstel, N. (2007). Caring for our young: Childcare in Europe and the United States. Ed. Ferguson, S.J. Shifting the center: Understanding contemporary families. 3rd Ed. McGraw Hill: Boston, MA&lt;/ref&gt;

Stratification in the educational system is further diminished by providing all Swedish citizens and legal residents with the option of choosing which school they want their children to be placed in, regardless of what neighborhood they reside in or what property taxes they pay. Additionally, the Swedish government not only provides its citizens with a free college education, but also with an actual monthly allowance for attending school and college.&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt;

Together, these privileges allow for all Swedish children to have access to the same resources. A similar system can be found in France, where free, full-day child care centers known as "écoles maternelles" enroll close to 100% of French children ages 3–5 years old. In Denmark, children from birth to age six are enrolled in childcare programs that are available at one-fifth the total costs, where the rest is covered by public funding.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3603">'''Educational measurement''' refers to the use of educational assessments and the analysis of data such as scores obtained from educational assessments to infer the abilities and proficiencies of students. The approaches overlap with those in [[psychometrics]].
Educational measurement is the assigning of numerals to traits such as achievement, interest, attitudes, aptitudes, [[intelligence]] and performance.   

==Overview==
The aim of theory and practice in educational measurement is typically to measure abilities and levels of attainment by students in areas such as reading, writing, mathematics, science and so forth. Traditionally, attention focuses on whether assessments are reliable and valid. In practice, educational measurement is largely concerned with the analysis of data from educational assessments or tests. Typically, this means using total scores on assessments, whether they are multiple choice or open-ended and marked using marking rubrics or guides.

In technical terms, the pattern of scores by individual students to individual items is used to infer so-called scale locations of students, the "measurements". This process is one form of scaling. Essentially, higher total scores give higher scale locations, consistent with the traditional and everyday use of total scores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Baker | first = F| title = The Basics of Item Response Theory| publisher = ERIC Clearinghouse on Assessment and Evaluation | location = University of Maryland, College Park, MD | year = 2001 | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; If certain theory is used, though, there is not a strict correspondence between the ordering of total scores and the ordering of scale locations. The Rasch model provides a strict correspondence provided all students attempt the same test items, or their performances are marked using the same marking rubrics.

In terms of the broad body of purely mathematical theory drawn on, there is substantial overlap between educational measurement and psychometrics. However, certain approaches considered to be a part of psychometrics, including [[Classical test theory]], [[Item Response Theory]] and the [[Rasch model]], were originally developed more specifically for the analysis of data from educational assessments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Rasch| first = Georg| title = Probabilistic models for some intelligence and attainment tests. |publisher = Danish Institute for Educational Research | location = Copenhagen | year = 1960 | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Lord | first = Fred | title = Applications of item response theory to practical testing problems. |publisher = Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.
 | location = CMahwah, NJ | year = 1980 | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the aims of applying theory and techniques in educational measurement is to try to place the results of different tests administered to different groups of students on a single or common scale through processes known as [[test equating]]. The rationale is that because different assessments usually have different difficulties, the total scores cannot be directly compared. The aim of trying to place results on a common scale is to allow comparison of the scale locations inferred from the totals via scaling processes.

'''Facila''' is a training program, in Southern Europe, for adults with short primary schooling. The objective is to prepare students for validation processes and secondary education. Many participants are [[entrepreneurs]], owners or employees of small and medium enterprises, [[Small and medium enterprises|SME]]:s. In these cases the program provides opportunity for training in [[entrepreneurship]] and "[[continuous improvement]]" to enhance the participant's [[employability]].

The program started in 2007 as a cooperation between [[Sweden]] and [[Portugal]]. It is based on the Swedish program "Kunskapslyftet" and adapted to Southern European conditions on an initiative by Johan Frisk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.evta.net/evta_tube/facila.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723122815/http://www.evta.net/evta_tube/facila.html |archivedate=2011-07-23 |df= }} Presentation, European Vocational Training Federation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dn.se/nyheter/varlden/utbildning-ska-radda-portugal-1.1221990 Dagens Nyheter (Swedish Newspaper)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=3304&amp;artikel=3497424 Sveriges Radio (Swedish public radio)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ww1.rtp.pt/multimedia/progVideo.php?tvprog=24786&amp;idpod=37314 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130202412/http://ww1.rtp.pt/multimedia/progVideo.php?tvprog=24786 |archivedate=2010-11-30 |df= }} "Iniciativa", min 37:30-41:30 RTP2 (Portuguese public television)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.euractiv.com/en/enterprise-jobs/can-entrepreneurship-be-taught-news-494547 Interview "EuroActiv"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coaching World June 2010 p12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tsf.sapo.pt/PaginaInicial/AudioeVideo.aspx?content_id=1599197 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100809030549/http://tsf.sapo.pt/paginainicial/AudioeVideo.aspx?content_id=1599197 |archivedate=2010-08-09 |df= }} "Qualificar a população adulta activa" TSF (Portuguese radio)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theopenmanager.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207234933/http://www.theopenmanager.com/ |date=2011-02-07 }} Blog "The Open Manager"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Continuous improvement projects==
Apart from basic training, the main objective of the [http://www.facila.eu/english/ Facila] program is to teach students how to prepare  improvement projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tsf.sapo.pt/PaginaInicial/AudioeVideo.aspx?content_id=1603152 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100810050714/http://tsf.sapo.pt/paginainicial/AudioeVideo.aspx?content_id=1603152 |archivedate=2010-08-10 |df= }} radio program in Portuguese, "Mãos à Obra" (TSF) interview with the training coordinator&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projectos de melhoria contínua==
O ponto fulcral do processo formativo são os projectos de melhoria.&lt;ref&gt;https://tsf.sapo.pt/PaginaInicial/AudioeVideo.aspx?content_id=1603152 programa rádio, "Mãos à Obra" (TSF) entrevista com a coordenadora da formação&lt;/ref&gt; Cada formando é convidado an analisar o seu posto de trabalho,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iefp.pt/iefp/publicacoes/Formar/Paginas/Formar2008.aspx Formar-revista para formadores nº65, p11-14 (IEFP)&lt;/ref&gt; aplicar componentes da Matemática para a Vida, procurar padrões e traduzi-los para a linguagem matemática. O procedimento permite aumento de produtividade e assim o aumento da [[empregabilidade]] do formando. Se a mesma metodologia é aplicada por donos de pequenas empresas, o resultado do processo leva an aumentos do [[empreendedorismo]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Método formativo==
A metodologia contempla duas vertentes fundamentais, individual e social. O processo de orientar adultos, a [[Andragogia|andragogia]], serve de base para depois construir sobre os conhecimentos existentes de cada participante. O processo social constitui a pedra angular na [[Capacitação|capacitação]] de formandos adultos, a convicção de ser capaz, o [[Teoria da atribuição#Locus de causalidade|"locus interno"]], an inter-ajuda inspirada na pesquisa do Professor [[Sugata Mitra]], são todos componentes do importante "coaching de grupos" que caracteriza o programa Facila.

==Financiamento==
Este projecto é apoiado pelo [http://www.poph.qren.pt/ Programa Operacional de Potencial Humano (POPH)] na medida 2.3, formações modulares certificadas. Como em muitos programas comunitários, o POPH é financiado com verbas oriundas do [[Fundo Social Europeu]] (75%) e o Orçamento do Estado Português (25%).

==Quadro Nacional de Qualificações==
Como consequência da [[Estratégia de Lisboa]] há uma nova visão sobre conhecimento, uma visão mais preocupada com as evidências do que propriamente com o percurso da sua obtenção. Em Portugal, o [http://www.catalogo.anq.gov.pt/Home/QNQ Quadro Nacional de Qualificações] pretende regularizar e valorizar os conhecimentos obtidos por vias não formais e informais.

O programa Facila, com a sua função na preparação de formandos para o processo de [[Rvcc|reconhecimento e validação]] da iniciativa [[Novas Oportunidades]], pretende contribuir para a qualificação de adultos europeus.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6914">'''First Principles of Instruction''', created by [[M. David Merrill]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mdavidmerrill.com/&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[Emeritus]] at [[Utah State University]], is an [[instructional theory]] based on a broad review of many instructional models and theories.&lt;ref&gt;Merrill, M. D. (2002). First principles of instruction. Educational Technology Research and Development, 50(3), 43-59. [http://www.mdavidmerrill.com/Papers/firstprinciplesbymerrill.pdf (Click for copy from Dr. Merrill's personal website)]
&lt;/ref&gt; First Principles of Instruction are created with the goal of establishing a set of principles upon which all instructional theories and models are in general agreement, and several authors acknowledge the fundamental nature of these principles.&lt;ref&gt;Instructional-Design Theories and Models, Volume III: Building a Common Knowledge Base [http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780805864564/ (link to book site)]&lt;/ref&gt; These principles can be used to assist teachers, trainers and instructional designers in developing research-based [[instructional materials]] in a manner that is likely to produce positive student learning gains.

==The Principles==
First Principles of Instruction are described as a set of interrelated principles which, when properly applied in an instructional product or setting, will increase student learning. These principles include the following:&lt;ref&gt;Merrill, M. D. (2009). First Principles of Instruction. In C. M. Reigeluth &amp; A. Carr (Eds.), Instructional Design Theories and Models: Building a Common Knowledge Base (Vol. III). New York: Routledge Publishers. [http://www.mdavidmerrill.com/Papers/FirstPrinciplesReigeluthCarr.pdf (Click for copy)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Merrill, M. D. (2007). First principles of instruction: a synthesis. In R. A. Reiser &amp; J. V. Dempsey (Eds.), Trends and Issues in Instructional Design and Technology, 2nd Edition (Vol. 2, pp. 62-71). Upper Saddle River, NJ: Merrill/Prentice Hall. [http://www.mdavidmerrill.com/Papers/FirstPrinciplesSynthesis.pdf (Click for copy)]&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Task/Problem-Centered''' – Students learn more when the instruction is centered on relevant real-world tasks or problems, including a series of tasks or problems that progress from simple to complex.
* '''Activation''' – Students learn more when they are directed to recall prior knowledge, to recall a structure for organizing that knowledge, or are given a structure for organizing new knowledge. This activation can also include a foundational learning experience upon which new learning can be based.
* '''Demonstration''' – Students learn more when new knowledge is demonstrated to them in the context of real-world tasks or problems. The knowledge that is demonstrated is both informational and skill-based. Demonstration is enhanced when it adheres to research-based principles of e-learning.
* '''Application''' – Students learn more when they perform real-world tasks or solve real-world problems and receive feedback and appropriate guidance during that application.
* '''Integration''' – Students learn more when they are encouraged to integrate their new knowledge into their life through reflection, discussion, debate, and/or presentation of new knowledge.

These principles can be used in a Task or Problem-Centered cycle of instruction beginning with Activation and continuing through Demonstration, Application, and Integration.

First Principles of Instruction is similar to other task-centered instructional theories (e.g. Van Merriënboer’s Four Component Instructional Design Model&lt;ref&gt;van Merriënboer, J. J. G., Clark, R. E., and de Croock, M. B. M. (2002a). Blueprints for complex
learning: The 4C/ID-model. Educ. Technol., Res. Dev. 50(2): 39–64.&lt;/ref&gt;) in that it uses a real-world problem or task as a vehicle for instruction. Students view demonstrations of real-world problem solving examples, are given opportunities to solve real-world problems and are given feedback on their application. Students are taught new knowledge and information within the context of the real-world task or problem, which provides a context in which the knowledge is obtained. First Principles is different than problem-based-learning, however, in that it provides more guidance and demonstration to students which is reduced as students gain expertise.

==Research support==
There is a growing body of research support for Merrill's First Principles of Instruction. In one study, researchers surveyed 140 students at 89 different higher education institutions and discovered that students were 9 times more likely to report that they had mastered learning the course objectives when First Principles of Instruction were used and when they spent ample time and effort studying.&lt;ref&gt;Frick, T., Chadha, R., Watson, C., Wang, Y., &amp; Green, P. (2007). Theory-based course evaluation: Nine Scales for measuring teaching and learning quality. Retrieved from http://www.indiana.edu/~tedfrick/TALQ.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Another study observed award-winning instructors at an institute of higher education and found that they used some or all of First Principles of Instruction in their teaching strategies, thereby linking acclaimed instructors with the principles.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, J., (2011).

{{Nihongo|'''''Fushūgaku'''''|不就学}} is a Japanese term meaning non-attendance of [[Education in Japan|school]].

== Characteristics ==
There are a number of reasons as to why these children do not go to school. There are many cases where they cannot understand the Japanese language. In other cases they may be able to understand both Japanese and their own [[Mother tongue|native language]], but their level of conversation is insufficient to participate in class lessons. Bullying by native Japanese students may also contribute to their choice not to attend school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Japan’s all too tentative opening to immigration|url=http://www.japanwatching.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=98:japans-all-too-tentative-opening-to-immigration&amp;catid=36:society&amp;Itemid=2|publisher=Japan Watching|accessdate=August 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, the children have parents who both work to support the family, and the children end up being left at [[Latchkey kid|home alone]]. In these families, they spend time together late at night after their parents stop working. On their parents' day off, they go out late at night together (shopping, etc.) They pass their time at autonomous Japanese language classrooms that were built for the children of foreigners. These parents are usually [[blue-collar worker]]s.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Other reasons are that the parents of ''fushugaku'' children want their children to go to a school where they would use their native language. However, such schools cost between 30,000 and 50,000 yen per month, so parents cannot afford to send their children.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12867">'''Gender inequality in curricula''' exposes indications that female and male learners are not treated equally in various types of [[Curriculum|curricula]]. There are two types of curricula: formal and informal. Formal curricula are introduced by a government or an educational institution. Moreover they are defined as sets of objectives, content, resources and assessment. Informal curricula, also defined as [[Hidden curriculum|hidden]] or unofficial, refer to attitudes, values, beliefs, assumptions, behaviours and undeclared agendas underlying the learning process. These are formulated by individuals, families, societies, religions, cultures and traditions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002316/231646e.pdf|title=A Guide for Gender Equality in Teacher Education Policy and Practices|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100069-0|location=|pages=9–10, 59–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More particularly, [[gender inequality]] is apparent in the curriculum of both schools and Teacher Education Institutes (TEIs). [[Physical education]] (PE) is particularly delicate, as gender equality issues coming from preconceived [[Gender stereotyping|stereotyping]] of boys and girls often arise. It is often believed that  boys are better at physical exercise than girls and that these are better at 'home' activities including sewing and cooking. This belief prevails in many cultures around the world and is not bound to one culture only.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Curriculum language and gender ==
Some curricular objectives show that the language used is gender biased. Indeed, it can happen that the language itself can communicate the status of being male or female, and the status of being assertive or submissive. In many cultures, 'being male' is expressed in language as being confident. In Japan, according to Pavlenko,&lt;ref&gt;Norton, B. &amp; Toohey, K. (eds). 2004. ''Critical Pedagogies and Language Learning''. Cambridge, Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; female Japanese learners are led 'to see English as a language of empowerment. The students state that ... the pronoun system of English allow[s] them to position and express themselves differently as more independent individuals than when speaking Japanese.' This example clearly shows how languages, reflecting cultures, are the basis for introducing gender inequalities highlighting the curricula.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Curriculum structure and gender ==
Many Teacher Education Institutes (TEIs) around the world, which set curricula, i.e. teaching diplomas, show a worrying shortcoming regarding issues of gender equality. For instance, students who prove being prepared to become schoolteachers are taught on education theories, the [[psychology of learning]], teaching methodologies and class management, among others and one or two practical courses. There is no highlight on gender equality-related issues in their training.  Even courses on curriculum design ignore these issues. This omission is highly problematic and should be addressed by curriculum designers of TEIs. It is important that gender equality issues are part of the curriculum in order to help future teachers to be more sensitive about gender equality issues. Thus when they become teachers, they can become agents of change in their schools.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Content of instructional materials and gender ==
Teachers often use materials, including texts, images or examples that reinforce stereotyped roles. Typical examples given include, roles of the father (reading the newspaper) and the mother (serving dinner); the doctor (male) and the nurse (female); playing ball (boy) and combing doll's hair (girl). By doing this, teachers are also promoting gender bias which favors girls as well. For instance, bullying and noise-making for boys and politeness and gentleness for girls. Gender bias does not only favor males over females; it can also go the other way around. They are both negative when considering a healthy relationship between the teacher and the learner.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== A gender equal curriculum ==
A gender equal curriculum shows the diversity of society when increasing examples that highlight successful female characters in texts as well as in the examples used during classes. Instructional materials, including textbooks, handouts or workbooks, should be studies to determine whether they are gender biased, gender neutral or gender-sensitive/responsive. In Teacher Education Institutes (TEIs), curricula need to include elements that recognize gender equality-related issues in learning materials, and how those issues can be faced by teachers once they take up the profession and start to use these materials in their classes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Quality curriculum should include gender equality as a result of teaching and learning in TEIs, as well as in schools. Educational systems that adopt gender equality aspects are able to: 
* Revise its curriculum framework to explicitly state commitment to gender equality.
* Emphasize attitudes and values that promote gender equality.
* Ensure that the content of the course syllabus includes values and attitudes of gender equality. y Revise textbooks and learning materials to become gender-sensitive.
* Remove gender-based stereotypes that contribute towards perpetuating gender inequalities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Approaches in preventing gender inequality and school-related gender-based violence ==

It is possible to integrate [[school-related gender-based violence (SRGBV)]] prevention into the curriculum for children of all school-going ages. Topics include [[Comprehensive sex education|comprehensive sexuality education]] (CSE), life skills education, [[Civics|civics education]] and targeted approaches on managing aggression, developing bystander skills, forming healthy relationships and protection from [[bullying]] – these elements are often combined.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002466/246651E.pdf|title=Global guidance on addressing school-related gender-based violence|last=UNESCO and UN Women|first=|publisher=UNESCO and UN Women|year=2016|isbn=978-92-3-100191-8|location=61-62|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples ===

==== The World Starts with Me, Uganda ====

In 2002, two Dutch NGOs including the [[World Population Foundation]] and Butterfly Works, created The World Starts with me. Aimed at students aged 12 – 19 years old, it is a low-tech, online, interactive sex education programme. The programme uses David and Rose, two virtual peer educators who guide students through fourteen lessons around self-esteem, healthy relationships, sexual development, safer sex, gender equality and sexual rights. Each lesson includes an assignment-type lesson, for instance creating a storyboard, an art work or conducting a role play on the topic of that lesson. Evaluation of the programme (with the use of a quasi-experimental design) showed a significant positive effects on non-coercive sex within students in intervention groups. Indeed, they reported having more confidence in their ability to deal with situations where sexual pressure and force would be used.&lt;ref&gt;Rijsdijk, Liesbeth et al. 2011. The World Starts With Me: A multilevel evaluation of a comprehensive sex education programme targeting adolescents in Uganda. BMC Public Health, Vol. 11, p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

==== Programs H and M, Brazil ====

Named after the Spanish and Portuguese words for men and women (hombres in Sp., homes in Port., mujeres in Sp., mulheres in Port.), the programs H and M used an evidence-based curriculum and included a group of educational activities which were designed to be carried out in same-sex group settings, as well as by same-sex facilitators of the groups, who can eventually be consider as gender-equitable role models.&lt;ref&gt;Care International. 2012. ''The Young Men Initiative: Engaging young men in the Western Balkans in gender equality and violence prevention: A Case Study''. Banja Luka, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Care International.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

The manuals used by these programmes include activities on fatherhood/motherhood and caregiving, violence prevention, sexual and reproductive health including HIV/AIDS and other related issues. The activities of the programme included brainstorming role-playing and other exercises which contributed to students reflecting on how boys and girls socialized and the pros and cons of this socialization and to explore the benefits of changing certain behaviours.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

The programme was evaluated in several locations through mostly quasi-experimental studies. It showed evidence of positive changes in participants' gender-equitable attitudes and behaviours and showed reduced gender-based violence.&lt;ref&gt;Ricardo, C., Nascimento, M., Fonseca, V. and Segundo, M. 2010. ''Program H and Program M: Engaging young men and empowering young women to promote gender equality and health''. Washington, DC, PAHO/Best Practices in Gender and Health.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

==== Fourth R, Canada ====

This programme is based on the belief that relationship knowledge and skills can and should be taught in the same way as reading, writing and arithmetic, which gives the program its name. The programme is taught with children of grades 8 - 12.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Thanks to a five-year randomized control trial of the classes with Grade 9 students (aged between 14 and 15), it was found that when comparing, students who received standard health classes students (especially boys) who received the Fourth R used significantly fewer acts of violence towards a dating partner by the end of Grade 11.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, D., Crooks, C., Jaffe, P., Chiodo, D., Hughes, R., Ellis, W., Stitt, L. and Donner, A. 2009. A school- based program to prevent adolescent dating violence: a cluster randomised trial. ''Arch. Pediatr. Adolesc. Med.'', Vol. 163, No. 8, pp. 692–699.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

==== Second Step, United States ====

This Second Step program teaches skills such as communication, coping and decision-making with the objective to help young people navigate peer pressure, substance abuse and in person and online bullying. The aforementioned programme has been used with more than 8 million students in over 32,000 American schools.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

A two-year cluster-randomized clinical trial of Second Step was carried out with over 3,600 students at 36 middle schools in Grades 6 and 7 (aged 11–13 years) in Illinois and Kansas. At the end of the programme, the study found that, students in Illinois intervention schools were 39 per cent less likely to report sexual violence perpetration and 56 per cent less likely to self-report homophobic name-calling victimization than students in control schools. There was, however, no significant difference in the Kansas schools.&lt;ref&gt;Espelage, D., Basile, K. and Hamburger, M. 2012. Bullying Perpetration and Subsequent Sexual Violence Perpetration among Middle School Students. Journal of Adolescent Health, Vol. 50, No. 1, pp. 60–65.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

==== The Gender Equity Movement in Schools (GEMS), India ====

The GEMS project used extracurricular activities, role-playing and games. This project began in the sixth grade and worked for two years with boys and girls between the ages of 12–14 in public schools in Goa, Kota and Mumbai. In Goa and Kota, it was layered with ongoing school curriculum. In Mumbai, it was run as an independent pilot project in 45 schools.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

An evaluation study was implemented on the pilot which using a quasi-experimental design to assess the results of the programme on the students. Over the course of the programme, the study found that participating students were more supportive of girls pursuing higher education and marrying later in life, and of boys and men contributing to household tasks. However, an important component of GEMS, students' behaviours and attitudes around reducing violence prooved mixed results. The GEMS approach will now be carried out in up to 250 schools in Mumbai, following the success of the first pilot programme. It is also being rolled out in 20 schools in Viet Nam.&lt;ref&gt;ICRW. 2011. Building Support for Gender Equality among Adolescents in School: Findings from Mumbai, India. New Delhi, ICRW.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2470">'''Gross Enrollment Ratio''' ('''GER''') or '''Gross Enrollment Index''' ('''GEI''') is a [[statistics|statistical measure]] used in the [[education]] sector, and formerly by the [[UN]] in its [[Education Index]], to determine the number of students enrolled in school at several different grade levels (like elementary, middle school and high school), and use it to show the ratio of the number of students who live in that country to those who qualify for the particular grade level. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization(UNESCO), describes ‘Gross Enrolment Ratio’ as the total enrolment within a country ‘in a specific level of education, regardless of age, expressed as a percentage of the population in the official age group corresponding to this level of education.’&lt;ref&gt;Official UN definition for GER&lt;/ref&gt;

The GER can be over 100% as it includes students who may be older or younger than the official age group. For instance, the GER includes students who are repeating a grade, those who enrolled late and are older than their classmates, or those who have advanced quickly and are younger than their classmates. This allows the total enrollment to exceed the population that corresponds to that level of education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/114955-how-can-gross-school-enrollment-ratios-be-over-100|title=How can gross school enrollment ratios be over 100 percent? – World Bank Data Help Desk|website=datahelpdesk.worldbank.org|language=en|access-date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A combined gross enrolment ratio (CGER), incorporating all three levels of education, was used to calculate the [[Human Development Index|Human Development Index (HDI)]], an annual [[measuring well-being|gauge of well-being]] for [[United Nations|UN]] [[United Nations member states|member states]], from 1990 to 2009. Amongst  other measures used in the calculation, the CGER was given one-third weight in assessing the [[knowledge]] component, represented by gross enrolment, while the adult [[literacy]] rate was given two-thirds weight.&lt;ref&gt;http://hdr.undp.org/hdr2006/pdfs/report/Techinical_notes.pdf page 2&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Herbartianism''' (Her-bart-ti-an-ism) is an educational philosophy, movement, and method loosely based on the educational and pedagogical thought of German educator [[Johann Friedrich Herbart]], and influential on American school pedagogy of the late 19th century as the field worked towards a science of education. Herbart advocated for instruction that introduced new ideas in discrete steps. About a quarter-century after his death, Herbart's ideas were expanded in two German schools of thought that were later embodied in the method used at a practice school in [[Jena]], which attracted educationists from the United States. Herbartianism was later replaced by new pedagogies, such as those of [[John Dewey]].

== Description ==

[[File:Johann Friedrich Herbart.jpg|thumb|Herbart]]

Herbartianism was used most often in adolescent instruction and was greatly influential on American school pedagogy in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; Herbart believed in maintaining the integrity of a student's individuality for as long as possible during the education process as well as an emphasis on moral training.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1894|title=EVERYDAY USE OF HERBARTIANISM|jstor=44040318|journal=The Journal of Education|volume=40|issue=5 (979)|pages=93–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of herbartiainsim was to aid students in their learning process, beginning from no knowledge to complete knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07248a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Herbart and Herbartianism|website=www.newadvent.org|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herbart's pedagogical method was divided into discrete steps: preparation, presentation, association, generalization, and application.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; In preparation, teachers introduce new material in relation to the students' existing knowledge or interests, so as to instill an interest in the new material. In presentation, the new material is shown in a concrete or material fashion. In association, the new material is compared with the students' previous knowledge for similarities and differences, so as to note the new material's distinction. In generalization, the new material is extrapolated beyond concrete and material traits. In application, if the students have internalized the new material, they apply it towards every facet of their lives rather than in a utilitarian manner.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; Through this process, students will be able to achieve complete knowledge on the curriculum being taught. Herbartianism provided terminology for didactic theory and helped improve teachers professionalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx|title="The Development of C. A.

== Rise and influence ==

[[File:Wilhelm Rein (IZ 44-1865 S 416).jpg|thumb|Rein later ran the Jena school, whose ideas were imported into American school pedagogy]]

While the term ''Herbartianism'' derives transparently from Herbart's name, the movement was only loosely connected to his own ideas and was not an organized practice until 25 years after his death in 1841. Herbartianism was developed from Herbart's philosophy,&lt;ref name="HEQ General Pedagogy"/&gt; and divided into two schools of thought. In the first, [[Tuiskon Ziller]] of [[Leipzig]] expanded on Herbart's philosophy of "unification of studies", especially around a single discipline (called "correlation" and "concentration", respectively).&lt;ref name="Credo"/&gt; In the second, Karl Stoy of [[Jena]] opened a practice school in the style of Herbart's [[Königsberg]] school. A student of Ziller and Stoy, [[Wilhelm Rein]], later led the Jena school and designed a German elementary school curriculum that the school used. This school became "the center of Herbartian theory and practice and attracted students of pedagogy from outside Germany, including the United States".&lt;ref name="Credo"/&gt;

Between the 1890s and the early twentieth century, Herbartianism was influential in [[normal schools]] and universities as they worked towards a science of education.&lt;ref name="Credo"/&gt; Adherents of Herbartianism founded the National Herbart Society in 1895&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; "to study and investigate and discuss important problems of education".&lt;ref name="Credo"/&gt; Among those prominent in the society were [[Charles De Garmo]] (their first president), [[Charles Alexander McMurry]], and [[Frank Morton McMurry]], who all wrote on methods in education. The society also acknowledged works influenced by Herbartianism, such as two works by [[John Dewey]], within a yearbook. The society removed Herbart from its name in 1902 and later became the National Society for the Study of Education.&lt;ref name="Credo"/&gt;

== Decline ==

Newer pedagogical theories, such as those of John Dewey, eventually replaced Herbartianism.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; Though Herbartian work is unpopular in the 21st century, its greatest influence was in the 19th century's "development of the science of education".&lt;ref name="Credo"/&gt; In the 1996 ''Philosophy of Education: An Encyclopedia'', J. J. Chambliss wrote that Herbartianism's influence shows wherever "thinking, moral judgment, and conduct" are considered simultaneously.&lt;ref name="Credo"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3901">'''Institutional research''' is a broad category of work done at schools, colleges and universities to inform campus decision-making and planning in areas such as admissions, financial aid, curriculum assessment, enrollment management, staffing, student life, finance, facilities, athletics, and alumni relations.

Institutional researchers collect, analyze, report, and warehouse quantitative and qualitative data about their institution's students, faculty, staff, curriculum, course offerings, and learning outcomes. They are involved in collecting and reporting information to government bodies (for example, in the USA, the [[United States Department of Education]]'s [[Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System]]), to the public (e.g., [[Common Data Set]], the [[National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities]]'s  [http://www.ucan-network.org/ University-College Accountability Network]), and various college guide publishers (e.g., [[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] and [[College Board]]). On occasion, institutional researchers share data with one another to compare their own practices and outcomes against those of similar institutions. Institutional research is the source of much of the information provided to regional and national accreditation bodies to document how institutions fulfill the standards for accreditation.

In addition to reporting, institutional researchers often engage in data analysis, ranging from simply testing whether differences in reported data are statistically significant to developing and using causal and predictive statistical models.  Such models are often used in support of [[Educational assessment|assessment]] and [[Strategic Enrollment Management|strategic enrollment management]].

== Becoming an Institutional Researcher ==
Due to the need to provide data to the federal government and other entities, nearly every post-secondary institution has offices that fulfill the institutional research function. At some colleges and universities this function is centralized in a single office of institutional research, while at others it is more de-centralized. There is no single academic degree that qualifies one to be an institutional researcher, but suggested strengths include a knowledge of [[statistics]], [[research methods]] (e.g., [[survey research]] and [[focus groups]]), and computer-based reporting and data visualization tools (e.g., [[SPSS]], [[SAS System|SAS]], [[R_(programming_language)|R]], [[STATA]], [[Microsoft Access]], [[Microsoft Excel]], [[MicroStrategy]], and [[SQL]]). Other important assets are strong written and oral communications skills, attention to detail, and knowledge about how institutions of higher education operate. Several American universities offer graduate certificate programs in institutional research,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.airweb.org/Careers/GraduateEducation/Pages/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; including Ball State University, Florida State University, Humboldt State University,&lt;ref&gt;http://humboldt.edu/dee/ircertificate/&lt;/ref&gt; North Dakota State University, Penn State University, Indiana University, University of Missouri, University of Illinois, the University of Wisconsin - Stout &lt;ref&gt;http://www.uwstout.edu/programs/pdc/es.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;, and the University of California San Diego Extension. &lt;ref&gt;https://extension.ucsd.edu/courses-and-programs/institutional-research,&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2163">The '''integration of faith and learning''' is a focus of many religious institutions of [[higher education]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.virtualsalt.com/int/intdef.pdf Defining the Integration of Faith and Learning]&lt;/ref&gt; The broad concept encompasses the idea that the Christian worldview, faith, and practices of the student should be deeply connected within the learning experience. That said, different educators build their own visions of education onto the concept, what some call conceptions of faith learning integration. This idea is commonly found in [[Christian]] colleges in the United States, and is considered by some to be the essence of [[Christian]] higher education. PABATS, the accrediting association for Bible colleges in the Philippines has also shown interest in faith-learning integration. Christian Colleges of Southeast Asia, Southern Philippines Baptist Theological Seminary, Halls of Life Bible College, Davao Bible College and Koinonia Theological Seminary are now practicing faith and learning integration.&lt;ref&gt;

Higher education in the United States began largely as a Christian endeavor.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly all of the colleges founded during the colonial period were founded and supported by the dominant [[Christian denomination]]s of the time.

Some scholars claim that the current model of American higher education is convoluted because it has worked to separate faith from learning.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Lifewide learning''' ('''LWL''') is a [[teaching strategy]] and an approach to learning and personal development that involves real contexts and authentic settings. The goal is to address different kinds of learning not covered in a [[traditional classroom]]. By including LWL with a traditional classroom, students are better equipped to attain [[whole person development]] and to develop the [[lifelong learning]] skills.&lt;ref name="NAME"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.edb.gov.hk/index.aspx?nodeID=3110&amp;langno=1 | title=EDB Life-wide Learning | accessdate=2008-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the focus of education in Hong Kong and was developed for higher education at the University of Surrey England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Learning for a Complex World: A lifewide concept of learning, education and personal development|last=Jackson|first=Norman Jeffrey|publisher=Authorhouse|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4567-9370-8|location=United States of America|pages=347}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lifewide education]] is the means by which an institution encourages, supports and recognizes learners' lifewide learning. It is an approach to visualising learning and personal development as a whole of life enterprise.

Lifewide learning adds important detail to the broad pattern of human development we call lifelong learning – all the learning and development one gains as one progresses along the pathway of one's life. Lifewide learning recognizes that most people, no matter what their age or circumstances, simultaneously inhabit a number of different spaces – like work or education, being a member of a family, being involved in clubs or societies, traveling, taking holidays, and looking after their own well-being mentally, physically, and spiritually. So the timeframes of lifelong learning and the spaces of life-wide learning will characteristically intermingle, and who we are and who we are becoming are the consequences of this intermingling.

Most people have the freedom to choose which spaces they want to occupy and how they want to occupy them. In these spaces, they  make decisions about what to be involved in, meet and interact with different people, have different sorts of relationships, adopt different roles and identities, and think, behave and communicate in different ways. In these different spaces, they encounter different sorts of challenges and problems, seize, create or miss opportunities, and aspire to live and achieve their ambitions. The promise of lifewide education is that people can more fully appreciate and value their lives for the potential they hold for enabling them to become the people they want and need to become (in other words, their everyday pathway to [[self-actualization|actualising]] themselves).

[http://www.lifewideeducation.uk/ 'Lifewide Education'] a not for profit, community-based organisation was founded in 2011 to encourage and support the growth and exchange of knowledge and practices in educational settings relating to lifewide learning. Its programme of scholarly work explores the many dimensions of lifewide learning.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9723">The following is a '''list of the presidents and executive secretaries of the [[Religious Education Association]]'''.

The [[Religious Education Association]] is a nonprofit member association, serving as a professional and learned society for scholars and researchers involved in the field of religious education.  In 2003 it merged formally with the Association of Professors and Researchers in Religious Education. Up until that date, REA presidents could serve for more than a year at a time, while APRRE presidents served for only one year at a time. At the moment of merger, presidential terms were limited to one year and "practitioners" was added to the title of the organization, making it the "Religious Education Association: An Association of Professors, Practitioners and Researchers in Religious Education" (REA: APPRRE).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33143">'''M-learning''' or '''mobile learning''' is defined as education or training through the use of portable wireless devices such as mobile phones, personal digital assistants (pads), personal computers and small tablet PCs, to achieve the goal of mobility and interactivity. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bukharaev|first=Nail|last2=Wisam Altaher|first2=Ammar|date=2017|title=Mobile Learning Education has Become More Accessible|url=http://www.imedpub.com/articles/mobile-learning-education-has-become-more-accessible.php?aid=21566|journal=American Journal of Computer Science and Information Technology|language=en|volume=05|issue=02|doi=10.21767/2349-3917.100005|issn=2349-3917}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

M-learning technologies include handheld computers, [[MP3 player]]s, notebooks, mobile phones and tablets. M-learning focuses on the mobility of the learner, interacting with portable technologies. Using mobile tools for creating learning aids and materials becomes an important part of [[informal learning]].&lt;ref&gt;Trentin G. &amp; Repetto M. (Eds) (2013). [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235929936_Using_Network_and_Mobile_Technology_to_Bridge_Formal_and_Informal_Learning/ ''Using Network and Mobile Technology to Bridge Formal and Informal Learning''], Woodhead/Chandos Publishing Limited, Cambridge, UK, {{ISBN|978-1-84334-699-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

M-learning is convenient in that it is accessible from virtually anywhere. Sharing is almost instantaneous among everyone using the same content, which leads to the reception of instant feedback and tips. This highly active process has proven to increase exam scores from the fiftieth to the seventieth percentile, and cut the dropout rate in technical fields by 22 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Mobile Wave: How Mobile Intelligence Will Change Everything |last=Saylor |first=Michael |year=2012 |publisher=Perseus Books/Vanguard Press |isbn=978-1593157203 |page=176 }}&lt;/ref&gt; M-learning also brings strong portability by replacing [[book]]s and notes with small devices, filled with tailored learning contents. M-learning has the added benefit of being cost effective, as the price of digital content on tablets is falling sharply compared to the traditional media (books, CD and DVD, etc.). One digital textbook, for instance, costs one-third to half the price of a paper textbook (AFD, 2012), with zero marginal cost.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; 

Some of the possibilities offered by this methodology, according to Fombona, Pascual-Sevillana and González-Videgaray, are a greater and different access to information, along with transcendent innovations, such as the increase of informal and playful activities, iconic virtual, membership of specific groups, and networks of friendly interaction within new scales of values.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fombona|first=Javier|last2=Pascual-Sevillana|first2=Ángeles|last3=González-Videgaray|first3=MariCarmen|date=2017|title=M-learning and Augmented Reality: A Review of the Scientific Literature on the WoS Repository|url=https://doi.org/10.3916/C52-2017-06|journal=Comunicar|language=es|volume=25|issue=52|pages=63–72|doi=10.3916/c52-2017-06|issn=1134-3478}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Background==
Mobile learning is the delivery of learning, education or learning support on mobile phones, PDAs or tablets.&lt;ref name="educause.edu"&gt;Oller, Rick. [http://www.educause.edu/ecar ''The Future of Mobile Learning'' (research bulletin).] Louisville, CO: EDUCAUSE Center for Analysis and Research, May 1, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

New mobile technology, such as hand-held based devices, is playing a large role in redefining how people receive information.   "Numerous agencies including the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DoD), [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS), Intelligence community, and law enforcement are utilizing mobile technology for information management."&lt;ref&gt;Hosmer, Chet; Carlton Jeffcoat, Matthew Davis, Thomas McGibbon [http://www.thedacs.com/techs/abstract/518055 ''Use of Mobile Technology for Information Collection and Dissemination''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111004901/http://www.thedacs.com/techs/abstract/518055 |date=2012-01-11 }} Data &amp; Analysis Center for Software, March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History of M-learning ===
Concepts of m-learning was given by Alan Kay in 1970's. He joined Xerox Corporation's Palo Alto Research Center and formed a group to develop "Dynabook", which is a portable and hands on personal computer. It aimed to let children have access to the digital world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tracing the Dynabook: A Study of Technocultural Transformations|last=Maxwell|first=John|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;This project failed eventually due to the lack of technological support at that time. Until 1994, first smart phone, [[IBM Simon]], was created by Mitsubishi Electric Corp. It was defined as a handheld personal communicator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Abacus to Smartphone: The evolution of mobile and portable computing|last=Koblentz|first=Evan}}&lt;/ref&gt;From then on, technological companies started to design the so-called "smartphones". The creation of smartphone provided the platform for mobile-learning, and current of mobile device innovation pushed mobile learning to project and research status.

Chronologically, m-learning research has been characterized into three phases: first phase is the focus upon devices; second is the focus on learning outside the classroom; third phase is the focus on the mobility of the learner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Summary and Critique of M-Learning Research and Practice|last=Cochrane|first=Thomas|year=2013|isbn=9780415503693}}&lt;/ref&gt;At its second phase, around year of 2005, tremendous amount of projects has been done, four major projects are "The Leonardo da Vinci project From e-learning to m-learning led by Ericsson Education Dublin", "The Leonardo da Vinci project Mobile learning: the next generation of learning led by Ericsson Education Dublin", "The IST project M-Learning led by the United Kingdom government Learning and Skills Development Agency (LSDA)" and "The IST project MOBILearn led by Giunti Ricerca of Genoa, Italy". These projects are mainly targeted on the effects of m-learning, like motivation to learn, engagement in learning activities and focus on special needs people&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|last=Swan|first=Karen|title=Teaching and Learning with Mobile Computing Devices: Closing the Gap|year=2005|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.508.5837}}&lt;/ref&gt;; they set the tone for mobile learning, m-learning is prepared to transfer from project status to mainstream education and training.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=THE INCORPORATION OF MOBILE LEARNING INTO MAINSTREAM EDUCATION AND TRAINING|last=Keegan|first=Desmond|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And M-learning research is globalized now: Africa , Asia, North America, Europe, Scandinavia, Australia and New Zealand all have remarkable achievement on this field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Summary and Critique of M-Learning Research and Practice|last=Cochrane|first=Thomas|year=2013|isbn=9780415503693}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approaches==
[[Image:Military Mobile Learning.jpg|thumb|150px|The use of mobile learning in the military is becoming increasingly common due to low cost and high portability.]]

===Classroom===
[[File:Group Collaboration.png|thumb|Parts of Group Collaboration]]
Applications in [[classroom]]s and other [[learning space]]s combine the use of [[umpc|handheld computers]], [[PDA]]s, [[smartphone]]s or handheld voting systems (such as [[Clicker (classroom)|clickers]]) with traditional resources {{Harv|Tremblay|2010}}.
; Class management:

Mobile devices in brick-and-mortar classrooms can be used to enhance [[student-centered learning]], group [[collaboration]] among students through communication applications, interactive displays, and video features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Murray|first=Orrin|author2=Nicole Olcese|title=Teaching and Learning with iPads, Ready or Not?|journal=TechTrends|date=November–December 2011|volume=55|issue=6|doi=10.1007/s11528-011-0540-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Existing mobile technology can replace cumbersome resources such as textbooks, visual aids, and presentation technology.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|title=7 THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT MOBILE APPS FOR LEARNING|journal=EDUCAUSE Learning Initiative|date=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Interactive and multi-mode technology allows students to engage and manipulate information.
*Mobile Device features with WIFI capabilities allow for on-demand access to information.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
*Access to classroom activities and information on mobile devices provides a continuum for learning inside and outside the classroom.&lt;ref name="Naismith 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Naismith|first=Laura|author2=Lonsdale, Peter  |author3=Vavoula, Giasemi  |author4=Sharples, Mike  |title=Literature Review in Mobile Technologies and Learning|journal=FutureLab Series|year=2004|issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a literature review conducted by FutureLab, researchers found that increased communication, collaboration, and understanding of concepts was a result of mobile technology applications.&lt;ref name="Naismith 2004"/&gt;

; Distance Learning:
{{See also|Distance Education}}
Mobile devices can be used in online settings to enhance learning experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, R. &amp; Reinhart, J. (2014). [http://bookboon.com/en/digital-thinking-and-mobile-teaching-ebook Digital Thinking and Mobile Teaching: Communicating, Collaborating, and Constructing in an Access Age]. Denmark: Bookboon.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The mobile phone (through text [[SMS]] notices) can be used especially for distance education or with students whose courses require them to be highly mobile and in particular to communicate information regarding availability of assignment results, venue changes and cancellations, etc. 
*Mobile devices facilitate online interaction between teacher and student, and student to student. Mobile devices make it possible to facilitate interaction in real time, allowing students to obtain immediate feedback. Educators can also assess student comprehension by using mobile devices, which provide real time updates on student progress, enabling teachers to adapt and personalize their teaching.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;
*It can also be of value to business people, e.g. [[sales representatives]] who do not wish to waste time away from their busy schedules to attend formal training events.

; Podcasting:
{{See also|Podcast}}
[[Podcasting]] consists of listening to audio recordings of lectures. It can be used to review live lectures {{Harv|Clark|Westcott|2007}} and to provide opportunities for students to rehearse oral presentations.
Podcasts may also provide supplemental information to enhance traditional lectures {{Harv|McGarr|2009}} {{Harv|Steven|Teasley|2009}}.

Psychological research suggests that university students who download podcast lectures achieve substantially higher exam results than those who attend the lecture in person (only in cases in which students [[Notetaking|take notes]]) {{Harv|Callaway|Ewen|2009}}.

Podcasts may be delivered using [[broadcast syndication|syndication]], although this method of delivery is not always easily adopted {{Harv|Lee|Miller|Newnham|2009}}.

===Work===
M-learning in the context of work can embrace a variety of different forms of learning. It has been defined as the "processes of coming to know, and of being able to operate successfully in, and across, new and ever changing contexts, including learning for, at and through work, by means of mobile devices".&lt;ref name="Pachler, N. 2011"&gt;Pachler, N., Pimmer, C., &amp; Seipold, J. (Eds.). (2011). ''Work-Based Mobile Learning. Concepts and Cases''. Oxford, Bern, Berlin, Bruxelles, Frankfurt am Main, New York, Wien: Peter-Lang, drawing on Pachler, N., Bachmair, B., &amp; Cook, J. (2010). ''Mobile Learning: Structures, Agency, Practices'' (Vol. 1). New York, Dordrecht, Heidelberg, London: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

*M-learning for work
*M-learning at and through work
*Cross-contextual m-learning

'''Learning for work''', which could be also described as 'just-in-case' learning, involves classic and formal education activities, such as training courses, that prepare learners for future work-related tasks. A typical, corporate application is the delivery of mobile compliance training, which can be seen as a viable means to reach geographically mobile employees, such as consultants&lt;ref&gt;Swanson, K. (2008). "Merrill Lynch: Bullish on Mobile Learning (case study)". ''Chief Learning Officer''. Retrieved from http://clomedia.com/articles/view/merrill_lynch_bullish_on_mobile_learning{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; or staff in logistic and transport systems.&lt;ref&gt;Stead, G., &amp; Good, M. (2011). "Mobile learning in vocational settings: lessons from the E-Ten BLOOM project". In N. Pachler, C. Pimmer, &amp; J. Seipold (Eds.), ''Work-based mobile learning: concepts and cases''. Oxford, Bern, Berlin, Bruxelles, Frankfurt am Main, New York, Wien: Peter-Lang&lt;/ref&gt; Another application is mobile simulations that prepare learners for future situations, for example real-time SMS-based simulations for disaster response training.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelius, S., &amp; Marston, P. (2011). "Work-based simulations: using text messaging and the role of the virtual context". In N. Pachler, C. Pimmer, &amp; J. Seipold (Eds.), ''Work-based mobile learning: concepts and cases''. Oxford, Bern, Berlin, Bruxelles, Frankfurt am Main, New York, Wien: Peter-Lang&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Learning at and through work''', which could be labelled as "just-in-time" mobile learning,&lt;ref&gt;Pimmer, C., &amp; Gröhbiel, U. (2008). ''Mobile Learning in corporate settings. Results from an Expert Survey''. Paper presented at the mLearn2008. The Bridge From Text To Context, Telford.&lt;/ref&gt; occurs in informal education settings at the workplace. Employees can use the mobile phone to solve problems via handheld devices in situ, for example by accessing informational resources (such as checklists and reference guides) prior to customer visits&lt;ref&gt;Ahmad, N., &amp; Orion, P. (2010). "Smartphones Make IBM Smarter, But Not As Expected". ''Training &amp; Development'', 64(1), 46-50.&lt;/ref&gt; or mobile decision support systems. The latter are popular in clinical settings where they support highly mobile medical staff through rule-based algorithms in the decision regarding more complex patient cases. Their application was associated with learning and in particular with practice improvement of medical staff.&lt;ref&gt;Grad, R. M., Pluye, P., Meng, Y., Segal, B., &amp; Tamblyn, R. (2005). "Assessing the impact of clinical information retrieval technology in a family practice residency". ''Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice'', 11(6), 576-586.&lt;/ref&gt; Learning through work also occurs by interacting with distant peers via phone. "People tagging" is an approach whereby people assign topics they associate with co-workers. The aggregation of interests and experiences serves not only as a means to raise awareness but also to help find competent experts on demand,&lt;ref&gt;Cook, J. &amp; Pachler, N. (2012). "Online people tagging: Social (mobile) network (ing) services and work‐based learning". ''British Journal of Educational Technology'', 43(5), 711-725&lt;/ref&gt; for example with context-sensitive expert location systems.

'''Cross-contextual learning''' that bridges the gap between work settings and formal education formats has perhaps the biggest potential for work-based mobile learning,&lt;ref name="Pachler, N. 2011"/&gt; especially with respect to tertiary education systems. This involves approaches in which learning in the workplace is facilitated and substantiated (for example through formative assessments,&lt;ref&gt;Coulby, C., Hennessey, S., Davies, N. &amp; Fuller, R.

The value of these mobile phone-mediated learning practices lies in the integration and reconciliation of work-based learning and formal education experiences which otherwise tend to remain separated.

===Lifelong learning and self-learning===
Mobile technologies and approaches, i.e. [[mobile-assisted language learning]] (MALL), are also used to assist in [[language learning]]. For instance handheld computers, cell phones, and [[podcasting]] {{Harv|Horkoff|Kayes2008}} have been used to help people acquire and develop language skills.

===Other===
* Improving levels of literacy, numeracy, and participation in education amongst young adults.
* Using the communication features of a mobile phone as part of a larger learning activity, e.g.: sending media or texts into a central portfolio, or exporting audio files from a learning platform to your phone.
* Developing workforce skills and readiness among youth and young adults.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/feb/26/mobile-education-mobile-phones |title= Youth Unemployment: Can Mobile Technology Improve Employability? |newspaper= The Guardian |date=February 26, 2013 |accessdate=August 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Around the world ==
=== Pakistan ===
In Pakistan, the Rehan School was one of the first initiatives to offer remote courses that could be accessed from a basic mobile phone. The application offers short educational sequences, showing how to write common names and words and conveying mathematical and scientific concepts. Sometimes featuring television personalities, the teaching sketches are intended for viewing on small telephone screens. The films are sold for a few cents in the telecoms boutiques and can then be exchanged by Bluetooth. The Rehan School estimates that over 40,000 individuals follow its lessons, but the real number is certainly higher.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;Agence Française de Développement, Agence universitaire de la Francophonie, Orange, &amp; UNESCO. (2015). [http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002318/231867e.pdf Digital Services for Education in Africa]. ''Savoirs communs, 17.''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Papua New Guinea ===
In Papua New Guinea, the SMS Story project has improved teachers' classroom practices in teaching children to read by using short messages and sent by SMS.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Sub-Saharan Africa ===
Since the 1960s, various information and communication technologies have aroused strong interest in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] as a way of increasing access to education, and enhancing its quality and fairness. In Sub-Saharan Africa, teachers and students are faced with an extreme shortage of teaching materials. The number of textbooks available are limited, so few students have individual access to textbooks in class or at home. Given the shortage of textbooks in many African schools, tablets and mobile phones are being viewed by governments and international organizations as a solution to provide access to learning materials. In one example, the Tangerine mobile assessment and coaching system, deployed in Kenya, aims to help teachers in their assessment activities. With Tangerine, a student's reading level can be evaluated by recording the student's answers on a mobile phone or a tablet. The data gathered by the application also allows comparisons of the learning levels of students according to their age, geographical area and gender.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

==Analysis==

===Value===
;The value of mobile learning&lt;ref&gt;''Mobile learning in Practice: Piloting a Mobile Learning Teachers’ Toolkit in Further Education Colleges''. C. Savil-Smith ''et al.'' (2006), p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;
Tutors who have used m-learning programs and techniques have made the following value statements in favor of m-learning.

*It is important to bring new technology into the classroom.
*Devices used are more lightweight than books and PCs. 
*Mobile learning can be used to diversify the types of learning activities students partake in (or a blended learning approach).
*Mobile learning supports the learning process rather than being integral to it.
*Mobile learning can be a useful add-on tool for students with special needs. However, for SMS and MMS this might be dependent on the students’ specific disabilities or difficulties involved.
*Mobile learning can be used as a ‘hook’ to re-engage disaffected youth.
*M-Learning can be designed to combine decision making in complex learning scenarios with formative scoring and assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.iadisportal.org/digital-library/a-holistic-approach-to-scoring-in-complex-mobile-learning-scenarios#|title=MCCSIS 2016 |chapter=A Holistic Approach to Scoring in Complex Mobile Learning Scenarios |last=Gebbe |first=Marcel |last2=Teine |first2=Matthias |last3=Beutner |first3=Marc |date=2016 |publisher=IADIS Press |editor=Miguel Baptista Nunes |editor2=Maggie McPherson |isbn=9789898533517 |location=Madeira |pages=19-27 |oclc=958149790}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11693">The '''Mokken Scale''' is a [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] method of data reduction. A Mokken scale is a unidimensional scale that consists of hierarchically-ordered items that measure the same underlying, latent concept. This method is named after the political scientist [[Rob Mokken]] who suggested it in 1971.&lt;ref name=mokken1971theory&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mokken|first1=Rob|title=A theory and procedure of scale analysis: With applications in political research|date=1971|publisher=Walter de Gruyter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview == 
[[File:An Item Response Function.jpeg|thumb|An example of an Item Response Function|right|300px]]

Mokken scaling belongs to [[Item response theory]]. In essence, a Mokken scale is a non-parametric, probabilistic version of [[Guttman scale]]. Both Guttman and Mokken scaling can be used to assess whether a number of items measure the same underlying concept. Both Guttman and Mokken scaling are based on the assumption that the items are hierarchically ordered: this means that they are ordered by degree of "difficulty". Difficulty here means the percentage of respondents that answers the question affirmatively. The hierarchical order means that a respondent who answered a difficult question correctly is assumed to answer an easy question correctly.&lt;ref name="Crichton"&gt;Crichton, N. (1999) "Mokken Scale Analysis" ''Journal of Clinical Nursing 8, 388&lt;/ref&gt;
The key difference between a Guttman and Mokken scale is that Mokken scaling is probabilistic in nature. The assumption is not that ''every'' respondent who answered a difficult question affirmatively will ''necessarily'' answer an easy question affirmatively. Violations of this are called Guttman errors. Instead, the assumption is that respondents who answered a difficult question affirmatively are more ''likely'' to answer an easy question affirmatively. The scalability of the scale is measured by Loevinger's coefficient H. H compares the actual Guttman errors to the expected number of errors if the items would be unrelated.&lt;ref name="Crichton"/&gt;

The chance that a respondent will answer an item correctly is described by an item response function. Mokken scales are similar to [[Rasch model|Rasch scales]], in that they both adapted Guttman scales to a probabilistic model. However, Mokken scaling is described as 'non-parametric' because it makes no assumptions about the precise shape of the item response function, only that it is monotone and non-decreasing. The key difference between Mokken scales and Rasch scales is that the latter assumes that all items have the same item response function. In Mokken scaling the Item Response Functions differ for different items.&lt;ref name=vanschuur2003mokken/&gt;

Mokken scales can come in two forms: first as the Double Monotonicity model, where the items can differ in their difficulty. It is essentially, is an ordinal version of Rasch scale; and second, as the Monotone Homogeneity model, where items differ in their discrimination parameter, which means that there can be a weaker relationship between some items and the latent variable and other items and the latent variable.&lt;ref name=vanschuur2003mokken/&gt; Double Monotonicity models are used most often.

Double Monotonicity models are based on three assumptions.&lt;ref name=vanschuur2003mokken/&gt;
# There is a unidimensional latent trait on which subject and items can be ordered.
# The item response function is monotonically nondecreasing. This means that as one moves from one side of the latent variable to the other, the chance of giving a positive response should never decrease.
# The items are locally stochastically independent: this means that responses to any two items by the same respondent should not be the function any other aspect of the respondent or the item, but his or her position on the latent trait.&lt;ref name=vanschuur2003mokken/&gt;

The issue of sample size for Mokken scaling is largely unresolved. Work using simulated samples and varying the item quality in the scales (Loevinger's coefficient and the correlation between scales) suggests that, where the quality of the items is high that lower samples sizes in the region of 250-500 are required compared with sample sizes of 1250-1750 where the item quality is low.&lt;ref name="Straat"/&gt; Using real data from the Warwick Edinburgh Mental Well Being Scale (WEMWBS)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mentalhealthpromotion.net/resources/user-guide.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that the required sample size depends on the Mokken scaling parameters of interest as they do not all respond in the same way to varying sample size.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1080/21642850.2018.1505520|title = What are the minimal sample size requirements for Mokken scaling?

While Mokken scaling analysis was originally developed to measure the extent to which individual dichotomous items form a scale, it has since been extended for polytomous items.&lt;ref name=vanschuur2003mokken&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van Schuur|first1=Wijbrandt|title=Mokken scale analysis: Between the Guttman scale and parametric item response theory|journal=Political Analysis|date=2003|volume=11|issue=2|pages=139–163|url=http://pan.oxfordjournals.org/content/11/2/139.short|doi=10.1093/pan/mpg002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, while Mokken scaling analysis is a confirmatory method, meant to test whether a number of items form a coherent scale (like [[Confirmatory factor analysis]]), an Automatic Item Selection Procedure has been developed to explore which latent dimensions structure responses on a number of observable items (like [[Factor analysis]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = van der Ark | first1 = L.A. (Andries) | year = 2012 | title = New Developments in Mokken Scale Analysis in R | url = | journal = Journal of Statistical Software | volume = 48 | issue = 5 | doi=10.18637/jss.v048.i05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been some confusion in Mokken scaling between the concepts of Double Monotonicity model and invariant item ordering. The latter implies that all respondents to a series of questions all respond to them in the same order across the whole range of the latent trait. For dichotomously scored items, the Double Monotonicity model can mean invariant item ordering; however, for polytomously scored items this does not necessarily hold.&lt;ref name="Ligtvoet"&gt;Ligtvoet, R., van der Ark, L.A., te Marvelde J.M., and Sijtsma, K.

'''Myanmar National Education Law''' ({{lang-my|အမျိုးသားပညာရေး ဥပဒေ}}), enacted on 30 September 2014, is designed to reform the country's outdated education system. Drafted in March 2014, the bill was passed after being sent back to the floor by [[President of Burma|President]] [[Thein Sein]] with 25 proposed changes, 19 of which were accepted. From the beginning of its drafting process, the law faced criticism from students and teachers unions as well as various civil society groups. Concerns over the law later turned into protests, which were eventually cracked down by the [[Government of Burma|government]].

==National Education Law 2014==

'''Section 1''' includes definition of terms used in the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=National Education Law|date=30 September 2014|publisher=Pyidaungsu Hluttaw|pages=1–5|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As laid out in '''Section 2''', the main objectives of the law are to train students to become critical thinkers; to nurture students to become law-abiding citizens with democratic principles; to enable students to become citizens who could pass down their ethnic languages, traditions, literature and to value historical heritage and environmental sustainability; to enhance human resources in preparation for economic development and higher standards of living; to provide a learning environment that is up to date with international standards and to improve teaching, learning and research by using technology information and communication information; to help students excel in their own fields of interest; and to promote sportsmanship and school health projects.&lt;ref name=NEL&gt;{{cite book|title=National Education Law|date=30 September 2014|publisher=Pyidaungsu Hluttaw|pages=5–6|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Section 3''' of the law covers the fundamental policies of the law that include providing education for students with disabilities; providing education relevant to the lives of the students; and granting autonomy of colleges and universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=National Education Law|date=30 September 2014|publisher=Pyidaungsu Hluttaw|pages=6–7|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Section 4''' outlines the formation of National Education Commission that will consist of ministers from related sectors, experts from nationality groups and relevant individuals. The duties of the committee include providing guidelines on implementation of the objectives and the policies of the law; setting policies to ensure the quality of education; working with the government and local administration to get funding for the education sector; making policies regarding shutting down or opening of domestic as well as international schools; and working with relevant departments and ministries on short-term and long-term educational goals. Article 7 of the Section 4 also states that the commission should not interfere with the management of institutions of higher education but only assist with policy-related issues for their development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=National Education Law|date=30 September 2014|publisher=Pyidaungsu Hluttaw|pages=7–8|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Section 5''' states that public education will be divided into primary education, vocational education and higher education. The section also talks about formal and informal education as well as self-learning education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=National Education Law|date=30 September 2014|publisher=Pyidaungsu Hluttaw|pages=9–12|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Section 6''' covers the different types of schools that include public schools, private schools, monastic schools, volunteer schools, regional schools, government-funded schools, special schools and emergency mobile schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=National Education Law|date=30 September 2014|publisher=Pyidaungsu Hluttaw|pages=12–13|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Section 7''' is about curriculum and it states that National Education Commission has to ensure curriculums used in the country have boundaries and standards and guarantee autonomy of curriculum formations if it meets these standards. Ministry of Education will set the standards of National Education Curriculum with approval from the Commission. Schools can teach in either Burmese or English or both languages and if necessary, an ethnic language and Burmese can be used in primary education. It also mentions that in States and Regions, ethnic language and literature program can be implemented through state and regional governments starting from elementary level and upgraded step by step.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=National Education Law|date=30 September 2014|publisher=Pyidaungsu Hluttaw|pages=13–15|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Section 8''' details educational duties and benefits and explain the roles of parent(s) or guardian(s) and local and regional administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=National Education Law|date=30 September 2014|publisher=Pyidaungsu Hluttaw|pages=15–16|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Section 9''' focuses on requirements for and quality of teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=National Education Law|date=30 September 2014|publisher=Pyidaungsu Hluttaw|pages=16–17|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Section 10''' covers monitoring and accessing the education quality and states that in every level of education there must be a quality assessment scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=National Education Law|date=30 September 2014|publisher=Pyidaungsu Hluttaw|pages=17|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Section 11''' is on management and administrative duties of education. In Article 56 (a), it states the Ministry of Education, relevant ministries and Higher Education Committee will work together to manage related institutions of higher education based on this law and existing laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=National Education Law|date=30 September 2014|publisher=Pyidaungsu Hluttaw|pages=17–19|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Section 12''' covers budget&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=National Education Law|date=30 September 2014|publisher=Pyidaungsu Hluttaw|pages=19–20|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''Section 13''', Article 66 states that existing schools before the implementation of the law must operate according to the law by five years of its enactment.&lt;ref name="National Education Law"&gt;{{cite book|title=National Education Law|date=30 September 2014|publisher=Pyidaungsu Hluttaw|pages=20|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Section 14 covers more general issues including that the law does not govern schools that only teach religion.&lt;ref name="National Education Law"/&gt;

==Background==
In March 2014, Education Promotion and Implementation Committee (EPIC) drafted the National Education Bill,&lt;ref name="burma teachers chime"&gt;{{cite news|title=Burma's Teachers Chime in on Education Reform|url=http://www.dvb.no/news/burmas-teachers-chime-in-on-education-reform-burma-myanmar/44176|accessdate=21 February 2015|publisher=Democratic Voice of Burma|date=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which went through both houses of [[Hluttaw]] on July 30, 2014.&lt;ref name="myanmar teachers' fed decry"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yen|first1=Snaing|title=Myanmar Teachers' Federation Decry Lack of Consulatation|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/teachers-federation-decries-lack-consultation-burmas-education-bill.html|accessdate=26 February 2015|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irawaddy Publishing Group|date=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the bill was waiting for the approval from President, students and teachers unions as well as the civil society groups raised concerns over whether the bill was drafted democratically . They claimed that even though the government held meetings to seek advice from the public, it ignored their recommendations.&lt;ref name="MTF joins students"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Aung|first1=San Yamin|title=Teachers' and Students' Organizations Join Up to Oppose Education Bill|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/teachers-students-organizations-join-oppose-education-bill.html|accessdate=26 February 2015|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing Group|date=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thein Sein sent back the bill to the parliament with some 25 proposed changes.  On September 26, the parliament accepted 19 of the proposed changes but denied 6 one of which is to delay the full implementation of the law to 2027&lt;ref name="students vow"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lwin|first1=Sithu|last2=Zaw|first2=Mg|title=Student unions vow to continue protests against education law|url=http://www.mmtimes.com/index.php/national-news/11994-student-unions-vow-to-%20continue-protests-against-education-law.html|accessdate=26 February 2015|agency=The Myanmar Times|date=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it became enacted on September 30. The next step is for Hluttaw to pass by-laws in the coming months to supplement the enacted law.&lt;ref name="students seek four-party"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zaw|first1=Nobel|title=Students Seek Four-Party Dialogue on Education Law|url=http://www.mmtimes.com/index.php/national-news/11994-student-unions-vow-to-%20continue-protests-against-education-law.html|accessdate=26 February 2015|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing Group|date=18 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Opponents of the law claimed that the government didn't seek advice from the students adequately. They were also unsatisfied that minority ethnic languages would not be taught at institutes of higher education.&lt;ref name="students vow" /&gt; They also stated that under the new law, universities would not be independent from [[Ministry of Education (Burma)|Ministry of Education]]&lt;ref name="students to hold emergency meeting"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Min|first1=Myat|title=Myanmar students to hold emergency meeting over education law|url=http://www.mizzima.com/mizzima-news/myanmar/item/13614-myanmar-students-to- hold-emergency-meeting-over-education-law|accessdate=26 February 2015|agency=The Myanmar Times|date=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most of all, they point out that the law will not recognize the formation of student and teacher unions.&lt;ref name="students seek four-party" /&gt;

On the other hand, members of Hluttaw responded that institutions of higher education would remain independent from central control. Khin Maung Yi, the secretary of the Joint Bill Committee, asserted that universities would have autonomy over creating their own policies. He also accused that protesters had "little understanding" of law.&lt;ref name="students vow" /&gt; [[Yin Yin Nwe]], a member of the President Education Advisory Group, remarked that complete decentralization of education would be impossible. The advisory group also stated that government committees that would be established as mentioned in the law were not designed to control universities but just to allocate budget.&lt;ref name="limits to how far"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Myint|first1=Nan|title=Limits to how far universities could be decentralized: gov't advisors|url=http://www.mizzima.com/mizzima-news/education/item/15009-limits-to-how-far- universities- could-be-decentralized-govt-advisers|accessdate=26 February 2015|agency=The Myanmar Times|issue=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National League for Democracy]], the main opposition party led by [[Aung San Su Kyi]], was rather silent on the issue. In fact, the party distanced itself from the student protests stating explicitly that they would not follow National Network for Education Reform and did not endorse its criticism of the law (behind the student protests). Moreover, [[Phyo Min Thein]], one the NLD's [[Pyithu Hluttaw]] Representatives, said that the current law was "practical" given the political constraints.&lt;ref name="behind the student protests"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lone|first1=Wa|title=Behind the student protests|url=http://www.mmtimes.com/index.php/in-depth/12359-behind-the-student-protests.html|accessdate=26 February 2015|agency=The Myanmar Times|date=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Main Opponents of the Law===

====National Network for Education Reform====
NNER is one of the most vocal opponents of the national education bill since its drafting stage. It is a coalition of civil society groups that include student unions, teacher unions, ethnic education groups, faith-based education groups, disabled education groups, community-based education groups, alternative education groups, education branches of political organisations, scholars and interested persons. It was formed in 2012 and had held several discussions across the country to seek opinions from the public on the current education reform process and in June 2013, it held a nationwide conference, attended by 1200 participants.&lt;ref name="students seek four-party" /&gt; During the drafting process of national education bill, NNER met with several government representatives and was even invited to meetings held in [[Naypyidaw]]. However, later it was left out from the discussion on the crafting of the bill.&lt;ref name="consider nothing"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thuzar|title='I Consider Nothing to Have Changed'|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/interview/consider-nothing-changed.html|accessdate=26 February 2015|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing Group|date=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Student and Teacher Unions====
The two most eminent student unions involved in opposing the education law are [[All Burma Federation of Student Unions]] and Confederation of University Student Unions and Middle Myanmar Student Unions. These organizations are also the major force behind the student protests against the law.

MTF (Myanmar Teachers Federation), a nationwide teacher union, is also one of the major opponents of the bill. It released a statement on September 15, 2014 to publicly assert their position on the issue:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We would like to announce to the people that we strongly believe that the National Education Law will affect not only the education sector but [also] the entire country and the people.  Therefore, the Myanmar Teachers Federation will fully cooperate with the student unions across the country who are pushing for the education reform that will benefit the country.&lt;ref name="burma teachers chime" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  

In the same statement, MTF also criticized the government for investigating the students' protests against the law and called for the drop of criminal charges.&lt;ref name="MTF joins students" /&gt;

==Student Protests==

===''Initial Protest: May 2014 - Sept 2014''===
The earliest protests against the National Education Law came even before the passage of the bill. In [[Mandalay Region]], students at colleges and universities had held ongoing protests since May 2014. The protests were, however, postponed in early September due to upcoming exams but the students continued holding public talks to voice why they opposed the bill.&lt;ref name="MTF joins students" /&gt; Initially, protesters also linked their campaigns against the bill to the arrest of an ABFSU member, Phyu Hnin Htwe, charged for allegedly kidnapping two Chinese workers from [[Letpadaung Copper Mine]].&lt;ref name="students vow" /&gt; Government authorities also initiated criminal investigations against these protests based on the ground that they were held without prior government approval.&lt;ref name="students vow" /&gt;

===''Emergency Student Meeting: October – 13 Nov 2014''===

On 4 October 2014, three days after the law was enacted, an organizing committee was formed composed of 10 members of ABFSU and 10 members of CUSU. On 10 October, ABFSU announced that they would be holding an emergency meeting with student representatives from across the country in November.&lt;ref name="students to hold emergency meeting" /&gt; The plan was to have a two-day meeting to discuss about the National Education Law on the first day and then make plans on how to proceed on the next day.&lt;ref name="students to hold emergency meeting" /&gt; Later, the meeting was held in Yangon from November 12 to 13, which concluded with the formation of Action Committee for Democratic Education - 15-person group that consists of members of ABFSU, CUSU and MMSU - in charge of planning the four-day protest in Yangon.&lt;ref name="students protest edu law"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zaw|first1=Nobel|title=Students Protest Education Law in Rangoon|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/students-protest-education-law-downtown-rangoon.html|accessdate=26 February 2015|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing Group|date=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Four-Day March: Nov 14–17 2014''===
[[File:Myanmar National Education Law Protests 1.jpg|thumb|Students protests at Yangon University]]
On November 14, about 350 students gathered in front of [[Maha Bandula Park]] in downtown [[Yangon]] to stage a protest against the National Education Law.&lt;ref name="behind the student protests" /&gt; The students also later held subsequent protests at [[Yangon University]] and [[Shwedagon Pagoda]].&lt;ref name="behind the student protests" /&gt; Moreover, Kyaw Ko Ko, the chairman of ABFSU, declared that the protest was just the beginning of the fight to reform National Education Law.&lt;ref name="students protest edu law" /&gt; He also stated that the main concern against the NEL is the formation of a National Education Commission composed of ministers and government officials that could limit students' opinions and further reinforce the government control over higher education.&lt;ref name="students protest edu law" /&gt; The protest also coincided with [[United States President]] [[Barack Obama]]'s second visit to [[Yangon]] although Kyaw Ko Ko claimed that it was not intentional.&lt;ref name="students protest edu law" /&gt; He added, though, that the students would be ready to seize the opportunity to raise awareness about issues on education.&lt;ref name="students protest edu law" /&gt; The Action Committee for Democratic Education then requested the government to convene a quadripartite meeting with its members, NNER, members of Parliament and the government to discuss the students' concerns.&lt;ref name="students protest edu law" /&gt; On 17 November, the students announced a 60-day interval for the government to respond to their demands and also threatened that they would stage a nationwide protests if the government didn't respond within the deadline.&lt;ref name="students protest edu law" /&gt;

===''60 day Ultimatum: Nov 18, 20 14– Jan 20, 2015''===

On November 18, a day after the students announced an ultimatum, Ministry of Education held a press conference, urging the students to attend a negotiating meeting with Education Promotion and Implementation Committee (EPIC), which drafted the legislation.&lt;ref name="limits to how far" /&gt; At the conference, Khin San Yee, the Minister of Education, said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I want them to negotiate freely and transparently. Every parent cannot fulfill all of the demands of their children. So think of us like the parents and demand and negotiate with us and we will do. But if the parents can't afford it, the children should understand it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On November 20, President's Education Advisory Group held a meeting at the Diamond Jubliee Hall at Yangon University, to assert their stance on the current controversy over National Education Law. While acknowledging the voice of the students on the importance of decentralization of education, the group claims that there are limits to how independent universities could be. It further claims that the formation of National Education Committee is the solely on the purpose of budget allocation but not to centralize control over institutions of higher education.&lt;ref name="limits to how far" /&gt;

Zaw Htay, the Director General of [[Higher Education in Burma|Higher Education]] Department (Lower Myanmar) stated that negotiations were still open, after the students rejected a meeting with the ministry. He also said that students, parents and experts would be consulted in the process of crafting by-laws&lt;ref name="behind the student protests" /&gt; [[Shwe Mann]], the speaker of [[Pyidaungsu Hluttaw]], also agreed to accept written submissions to the parliament while EPIC also offered to serve as an intermediary.&lt;ref name="behind the student protests" /&gt; The students, however, announced that they had no intention to write submissions to the parliament because they were waiting for the quadripartite meeting.&lt;ref name="student protest ed law mandalay"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zaw|first1=Nobel|title=Students to Protest Education Law in Mandalay|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/students-protest-education-law-mandalay.html|accessdate=26 November 2014|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing Group|date=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 26, the Action Committee for Democratic Education announced that they were planning a seminar on National Education Law in mid-December and would invite experts unaffiliated with the government or the protesters. They also had plans to stage two more protests in the upcoming week and had held three in the previous week.&lt;ref name="student protest ed law mandalay" /&gt;

On November 27, about fifty students from [[Mandalay]], [[Sagaing]], [[Monywa]] and [[Myingyan]] staged an unauthorized protest in front of City Hall in Mandalay to reiterate their demand: to convene a quadripartite meeting.&lt;ref name="gov't neglect"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mann|first1=Zarni|title=Government Neglecting Student Demands Mandalay Protesters Say|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/govt-neglecting-student-demands-mandalay-protestors- say.html|accessdate=26 February 2015|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing Group|date=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Myanmar Police Force|police]] at first stopped the students from exiting Eaindawyar Pagoda, their initial meeting point. The students, however, convinced the police that the officers' children themselves would benefit from the protests and were able to march to the City Hall and ended their protest at [[Mahamuni Buddha Temple]], a history significant place where 17 Burmese pro-independence leaders were killed during the colonial era.&lt;ref name="gov't neglect" /&gt;

On December 1, six students were threatened to get arrested for unauthorized protests that took place on November 29.

On December 12, the Ministry of Education formed a teacher union consisting of two teachers from each department of Yangon [[University of Foreign Languages, Yangon|University of Foreign Languages]].

Immediately after the march began, President [[Thein Sein]], announced in a state-run newspaper on Jan 21 that the parliament should reconsider some parts of the National Education Law and said that amendments would lead to stability and allow the students to resume their studies.&lt;ref name="prez urge"&gt;{{cite news|title=President urges education law rethink in face Mandalay March|url=http://www.mizzima.com/mizzima-news/education/item/17066-president-urges-%20education-law-%20rethink-in-face-mandalay-march|accessdate=26 February 2015|agency=Agence France-Presse|publisher=Mizzima|date=21 Jan 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 28, the student representatives and the government had a meeting in Naypyidaw – attended by ten student representatives, two members of parliament and Minister Aung Min as well as Deputy Education Minister Thant Shin.&lt;ref name="students march on" /&gt;  The government and the student leaders then released a joint statement announcing that they had agreed to stop the march to Yangon after the quadripartite meeting which would be held at the Diamond Jubilee Hall at [[Yangon University]] on February 1.&lt;ref name="students march on" /&gt; The statement also said that 11 demand-points from the students would also be discussed at the meeting on February 1. Meanwhile, the students declared that until they met with their representatives who went to Naypyidaw for the meeting, they would still continue the march.&lt;ref name="students march on" /&gt; On the other hand, the protesters in [[Pakokku]] and [[Dawei]] who were planning to join the march suspended their plans.&lt;ref name="students march on"&gt;{{cite news|title=Students march on, as talk date is agreed over Myanmar's education law|url=http://www.mizzima.com/mizzima-news/myanmar/item/17294-students-march-on-as-talk-date-is-agreed-over-myanmar-s-education-law/17294-students-march-on-as-talk-date-is-agreed-over-myanmar-s-education-law|accessdate=26 February 2015|agency=Mizzima News|date=29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Quadripartite Meetings: Feb 1–14, 2015''===

On February 1 as the quadripartite meeting was taking place, the NLD publicly announced that Thein Lwin, its central committee member and the chairman of National Network for Education Reform, did not represent the party or its policies.&lt;ref name="NLD distances" /&gt; It further mentioned in the statement that the NLD could take legal action against Thein Lwin for violating party rules regarding asking permission to participate in organizations independent of the party. [[Han Tha Myint]], a central committee member of the NLD, also stated that Aung San Suu Kyi, the chairman of the NLD, did not support Thein Lwin as his actions could be construed as representative of the party's stance on the issue.&lt;ref name="NLD distances"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mon|first1=Kyaw Su|title=NLD Distances Itself from Leading Voice on Education|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/nld-distances-leading-voice-education.html|accessdate=3 March 2015|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing Group|date=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ACDE promptly responded to that statement the next day by accusing the NLD for attempting to undermine the student protests at such a critical moment.&lt;ref name="NLD distances" /&gt;

The first quadripartite meeting ended with the students reaching an agreement concerning eight preconditions on further negotiations although the government denied the request to ensure security to demonstrators.&lt;ref name="protests continue"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zaw|first1=Nobel|title=Protests Continue as Students, Govt Discuss Education Reform|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/protests-continue-students-govt-discuss-education-reform.html|accessdate=3 March 2015|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing|date=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Aung Min]], a [[Office of the President of Burma|President's Office]] Minister, told the students that he would ask permission from the president the responsibility of the students' safety until they arrived in [[Mount Popa|Popa]] in [[Mandalay Region]].&lt;ref name="protests continue" /&gt; The first three preconditions from the students –issuing a public statement after every meeting, having information on education reforms available to the public, making sure all the parties involved in the meeting have equal opportunities to participate – were readily accepted while agreement on officially recognizing student and teacher unions was reached after four-hour long discussion albeit many details pending for further discussions.&lt;ref name="protests continue" /&gt; Furthermore, the meeting ended without any discussions on the eleven-point demands that the ACDE issued even though the students reached to an official agreement to continue the negotiations on February 3.&lt;ref name="protests continue" /&gt;

On February 3, in front of Ministry of Education headquarter in [[Naypyidaw]], the students announced that they would be resuming their nationwide protests.&lt;ref name="students vow action"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gyi|first1=Aung|title=Students vow action after govt delays talks|url=https://www.dvb.no/news/students-vow-action-after-govt-delays-talks-burma-myanmar/47968|accessdate=3 March 2015|agency=Democratic Voice of Burma|publisher=DVB Multimedia Group|date=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier that day, the government declared that the second quadripartite meeting was postponed after refusing to allow extra attendees who came along with the students to the meeting.&lt;ref name="students vow action" /&gt; During the meeting, Aung Min read out a letter, which he claimed to have just received from the president.&lt;ref name="students vow action" /&gt; The letter suggested that the meeting should be postponed and the government representatives decided to follow the president's advice after a discussion.&lt;ref name="students vow action" /&gt; That early afternoon, the [[Ministry of Information (Burma)|Ministry of Information]] released photos of government delegates standing in an empty room with a caption saying that the students did not show up to the meeting.&lt;ref name="students vow action" /&gt; Later that day, the government announced that the meeting would be postponed until February 12.&lt;ref name="students vow action" /&gt; The student leaders, meanwhile, declared that they have students ready to continue marching to Yangon from different parts of the country, including Mandalay in the north, Pathein in the southwest and Dawei in the south.&lt;ref name="students vow action" /&gt; On the same day, [[Aung San Su Kyi]] confirmed her opinions on the current protests, asking Thein Lwin to resign from his position in the central executive committee if he wanted to pursue his work with NNER.&lt;ref name="NLD resign" /&gt; Initially silent on the topic, U Thein Lwin said in a press conference on February 3 that he would accept NLD's decision.&lt;ref name="NLD resign"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lin|first1=Soe Than|title=NLD committee member must resign or cease education activism, says Suu Kyi|url=http://www.mizzima.com/mizzima-news/myanmar/item/17456-nld-committee-member-%20must-%20resign-or-cease-education-activism-says-suu-kyi|agency=Mizzima News|date=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 4, the student demonstrators from [[Ayeyarwady Region]] have arrived near [[Kyaunggon]] after they received a welcoming reception from the town residents. About 800 people also temporarily joined the students marching from Mandalay on their way to [[Taungdwingyi]] after the leaders gave a speech at [[Magway University|Magwe]] Computer University. The students also planned to stay and protest in [[Pakokku]] for three days starting February 5 before they resumed their march to Yangon. At the same time, a committee representing about 260 civil society groups released a statement urging the government to continue quadripartite meetings and to refrain from the use of violence against student protestors.&lt;ref name="govt postpones"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zaw|first1=Nobel|title=After Govt Postpones Education Talks, Students Continue March to Rangoon|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/govt-postpones-education-talks-students-continue-march-rangoon.html|accessdate=3 March 2015|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing Group|date=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 5, it was confirmed that students from Ayeyarwady Region and [[Taninthayi Region]] had continued marching to Yangon to join other protesters.  That same day, the government announced that some political organization with intentions to destabilize the country were behind the student protests even though it did not identify them.

On February 7, [[Ko Ko (minister)|Ko Ko]], [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Burma)|Minister for Home Affairs]], said in the interview that some political extremists were manipulating students to use methods of confrontation and that in some cases, most of them were supported by foreign organizations.&lt;ref name="students are puppets" /&gt; Ye Yint Kyaw, a member of the ACDE, retaliated by accusing the government of having the same mentality as the former military regime.&lt;ref name="students are puppets"&gt;{{cite news|title=Students are puppets, says minister|url=https://www.dvb.no/news/students-are-puppets-says-minister-national-education-law-burma-myanmar/48103|accessdate=3 March 2015|agency=Democratic Voice of Burma|publisher=DVB Multimedia Group|date=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Post-quadripartite Meetings: Feb 15 – March 1, 2015''===

Meanwhile, on February 24, the [[Amyotha Hluttaw]] (the Upper House) invited six major groups of stakeholders - the NNER, the ACDE, some 20 political parties, relevant members of the public, civil society groups and individuals who submitted the suggestions to the parliament - on the current issue to attend public hearings between March 5 – 15.&lt;ref name="parliament invites"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Noreen|first1=Naw|title=Parliament invites students for Edu Law briefing|url=https://www.dvb.no/news/parliament-invites-students-for-edu-law-briefing-burma-myanmar/48695|accessdate=11 March 2015|agency=Democratic Voice of Burma|publisher=DVB Media Group|date=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that day, the [[State Sangha Maha Nayaka Committee]] (SSMNC) – a body of government-appointed monks in charge of regulating Buddhist monks in Burma – issued a statement to the parliament publicly accusing that the proposed amendment bill that recognized unions will result in confusion between religious and political issues, leading to the demise of the roots of Theravada Buddhism]].&lt;ref name="NSC rejects"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zaw|first1=Nobel|title=National Sangha Committee Rejects Education Reform Demands|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/national-sangha-committee-rejects-education-reform-demands.html|accessdate=11 March 2015|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing Group|date=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arkar Moe Thu, a member of NNER, however, pointed out that according to Article 68(a), "schools that only teach religion are not governed by the law".&lt;ref name="NSC rejects" /&gt; Meanwhile, the students confirmed that they would continue marching on March 1, accusing the parliament for intentionally delaying the process of passing the amendment bill.&lt;ref name="NSC rejects" /&gt;

On February 25, in response to the accusation from the students, Khin Maung Yi, the chairperson of Joint Bill Committee, stated that the committee was not just buying time.&lt;ref name="bill committee"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bill committee: Education law amendment will not meet student deadline|url=http://www.elevenmyanmar.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=9153:bill-committee-education-law-amendment-will-not-meet-student-deadline&amp;catid=32:politics&amp;Itemid=354|accessdate=11 March 2015|agency=Eleven Myanmar|publisher=Eleven Media Group|date=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also claimed that the committee was putting all necessary effort to finalize the bill in the current parliamentary session amidst other important bills such as the budget bill, the taxation bill and the national planning bill.&lt;ref name="bill committee" /&gt; Moreover, since the education bill is not under the category of bills that will go directly to the Union of Parliament, it has to go through the Lower House and the Upper House before it could be passed.&lt;ref name="bill committee" /&gt;

On February 27, the students met with Shwe Mann, the Speaker of the [[Pyidaungsu Hluttaw]] and the Joint Bill Committee to voice their concerns over the competing bills but they were told that the bills were already submitted to the parliament.&lt;ref name="students cry foul"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zaw|first1=Nobel|title=Students Cry Foul Over Education Ministry Proposals|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/students-cry-foul-education-ministry-proposals.html|accessdate=11 March 2015|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing Group|date=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nanda Sit Aung, member of the ACDE, said that it was the violation of the quadripartite agreements because the bill that was submitted as the one proposed by students and the NNER was actually the one that everyone agreed at the quadripartite meeting.&lt;ref name="students cry foul" /&gt;
 
On March 2, as the students prepared to resume their march to Yangon from [[Letpadan Township|Letpadan]], the police surrounded the monastery where they were staying.&lt;ref name="myanmar prevents"&gt;{{cite news|title=Myanmar Prevents Students From Marching Against Academic Law|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/myanmar-prevents-student-protesters-marching-yangon-29316968|accessdate=11 March 2015|agency=Associated Press|publisher=ABC News|date=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The students then agreed to delay their march and were joined by another group of students that pushed through a barricade of riot police.&lt;ref name="myanmar prevents" /&gt;

On March 3, a confrontation broke out between the student protesters and the police when a group of female students went to sit in front of the monks who were on hunger strike.&lt;ref name="students face off"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Noreen|first1=Naw|title=Students face off against police in Letpadan|url=https://www.dvb.no/news/students-face-off-aginst-police-in-letpadan-burma-myanmar/48884|accessdate=11 March 2015|agency=Democratic Voice of Burma|publisher=DVB Multimedia Group|date=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police misinterpreted the move as the students attempting to push through the line and came charging toward the students.&lt;ref name="students face off" /&gt; The issue was later resolved when student leaders came to calm down the situation.&lt;ref name="students face off" /&gt; Earlier that day, students negotiated with Bago Region Border and Security Affairs Minister Col.

On March 4, the students woke up to find that the government had reinforced the blockade with barbed wire.&lt;ref name="tension sparks"&gt;{{cite news|title=Letpadan tension sparks return to nationwide education protests|url=https://www.dvb.no/dvb-video/letpadan-tension-sparks-return-nationwide-education-protests/48943|accessdate=11 March 2015|agency=Democratic Voice of Burma|publisher=DVB Multimedia Group|date=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The riot police also stopped a group of student protesters who left [Pyay] to join the students in Letpadan.&lt;ref name="tension sparks" /&gt; The truck the students were on was checked on its way to Letpadan and was not allowed to continue.&lt;ref name="tension sparks" /&gt; A police officer said that they were ordered to stop the protesters and that the students should wait for the results of the negotiation scheduled for the next day.&lt;ref name="tension sparks" /&gt; Police Lt.

On March 5, the student representatives boycotted the parliamentary hearings due to police blockade of the protesters in Letpadan.&lt;ref name="students exit"&gt;{{cite news|title=Myanmar students exit education bill hearing in solidarity with protesters|url=http://www.trust.org/item/20150305095639-djaos/|accessdate=11 March 2015|agency=Reuters|publisher=Thomas Reuters Foundation|date=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On that day, the protest staged right outside of [[Yangon City Hall]] to show solidarity with the student protesters in Letpadan was cracked down by the riot police and civilians with "duty" armbands.&lt;ref name="police charge"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Amarasinghe|first1=Gemunu|title=Myanmar police charge at student protesters with batons|url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/A/AS_MYANMAR_PROTEST_CRACKDOWN?SI|accessdate=11 March 2015|agency=Associated Press|publisher=ABQ Journal|date=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were in total about fifty protesters and eight people were arrested - five students and three members from 88 Generation Peace and Open Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Police coral student protesters|url=http://www.mizzima.com/mizzima-news/myanmar/item/18405-police-coral-student-|accessdate=11 March 2015|agency=Agence France‑Presse|publisher=Mizzima News|date=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of detaining them in a police station, they were taken to the former office of Ministry of Agriculture in [[Yankin Township]].&lt;ref name="students activist alleged"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zaw|first1=Nobel|title=Students, Activists Allege Violence in Rangoon Protest Crackdown|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/students-activists-allege-violence-in-rangoon-protest-crackdown.html|accessdate=11 March 2015|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing Group|date=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 6, all eight students were released but they were charged under Article 18 of Peaceful Assembly Law for organizing unlawful protest, which could result in up to one-year prison sentence.&lt;ref name="students activist alleged" /&gt; The same morning, another five student protesters near the town market in Letpadan were arrested and the Letpadan local police also announced that 11 people present at a rally two days earlier would  be charged under the same article used to arrest protesters in Yangon.&lt;ref name="students activist alleged" /&gt; There were also two rallies that day, one near the Yangon University campus and one at the entrance of Mandalay University campus to criticize the government's violent crackdown of the protests a day earlier in Yangon and to urge the government to let the students continue their march from Letpadan.&lt;ref name="rallies in ygn and man"&gt;{{cite news|title=Rallies in Rangoon, Mandalay to Condemn Police Crackdown|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/multimedia-burma/rallies-in-rangoon-mandalay-to-condemn-police-crackdown.html|accessdate=11 March 2015|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing Group|date=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 9, the students after going a hunger strike since March 3 announced the deadline at 10 am on March 10, asking the government to bring an end to the standoff in Letpadan and to allow them to continue marching to Yangon.&lt;ref name="scenes of violence"&gt;{{cite news|title=Scenes of Indiscriminate Violence in Letpadan as Police Attack Ambulance Workers, Students, Reporter|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/photo/scenes-of-indiscriminate-violence-in-letpadan-as-police-attack-ambulance-workers-students-reporter.html|accessdate=11 March 2015|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing Group|date=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 10, as the deadline expired, the students began to remove the barbed wire set up by the police but their attempt was futile.&lt;ref name="scenes of violence" /&gt; After their second attempt an hour later, the police declared that the protest was illegal and ordered the students to evacuate the monastery five persons at a time and not to leave Yangon in one group.&lt;ref name="scenes of violence" /&gt; The students refused and turned themselves in for peaceful arrests.&lt;ref name="scenes of violence" /&gt; The police then initiated an assault on the protesters including those inside the monastery.&lt;ref name="scenes of violence" /&gt; The exact number of injured people was not confirmed but the estimate was around 100.&lt;ref name="scenes of violence" /&gt; The police also attacked on volunteers working to escort the injured.&lt;ref name="scenes of violence" /&gt; Zar Zar Tun from [[Free Funeral Service Society]], an organization in support of the movement from the beginning, announced that the first ambulance provided by the organization transported six men and two women one of whom suffered a severe head injury. In a statement released by the Ministry of Information, a total of 127 people – 100 men and 27 women – were arrested.&lt;ref name="scenes of violence" /&gt; The Myanmar Council also released a statement later that afternoon condemning the arrest of the journalists during the crackdown.&lt;ref name="scenes of violence" /&gt; At 2:30 pm on the same day, a group of students marching from Hledan junction in Yangon to downtown was also dispersed using force, minutes after the protest began. Several people were injured and initially one of the protesters was handcuffed but later released at the scene after the students plead and agreed to disband.&lt;ref name="rangoon student protest"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thuzar|title=Rangoon Student Protest Quashed Within Minutes|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/rangoon-student-protest-quashed-within-minutes.html|accessdate=11 March 2015|agency=The Irrawaddy|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing Group|date=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Letpadan crackdown received criticism from the [[European Union]] as well as the NLD, which was not in support of the current student movement.

{{Italic title}}
The tractate '''''Of Education''''' was published in 1644, first appearing anonymously as a single eight-page quarto sheet (Ainsworth 6). Presented as a letter written in response to a request from the Puritan educational reformer [[Samuel Hartlib]], it represents [[John Milton]]'s most comprehensive statement on educational reform (Viswanathan 352), and gives voice to his views "concerning the best and noblest way of education" (Milton 63). As outlined in the tractate, education carried for Milton a dual objective:  one public, to “fit a man to perform justly, skillfully, and magnanimously all the offices, both private and public, of peace and war” (55); and the other private, to “repair the ruins of our first parents by regaining to know God aright, and out of that knowledge to love Him, to be like Him, as we may the nearest by possessing our soul of true virtue” (52).

==Influences==
The influences at work in the tractate are an interesting blend of [[Renaissance humanism]] with its emphasis on the ''via activa'', tempered by the more contemplative [[medieval]] concern with personal redemption. It is clear, however, that the overwhelming thrust of Milton's educational programme as outlined in the tractate is centred in the public objective. This is likely a reaction to the [[scholasticism]] that dominated the [[medieval university]] from the twelfth century, which still held sway in Milton's time (Ainsworth 25).

Important individual influences on Milton's tractate include Spanish educator [[Juan Luis Vives]] (1492–1540) and Moravian educator [[John Comenius]] (1592–1670). Both Vives and Comenius rejected the [[dialectic]]al approach in education in favour of empirical observation and “the study of things rather than words, nature rather than books” (Lewalski 204). In an interesting fusion of empiricism and morality, both educators promoted the idea that the study of nature was instrumental to the formation of moral character (Viswanathan 352).

==Milton's educational views==

===Medieval education===
The objective of medieval education was an overtly religious one, primarily concerned with uncovering transcendental truths that would lead a person back to God through a life of moral and religious choice (Kreeft 15). The vehicle by which these truths were uncovered was dialectic:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
To the medieval mind, debate was a fine art, a '''serious''' science, and a fascinating entertainment, much more than it is to the modern mind, because the medievals believed, like Socrates, that dialectic could uncover truth.  Thus a ‘scholastic disputation’ was not a personal contest in cleverness, nor was it ‘sharing opinions’; it was a shared journey of discovery (Kreeft 14–15).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The learners in the [[Middle Ages]] were the [[cleric]]s who comprised the literate segment of medieval society and who were responsible for the production, transmission and exposition of scholarly texts, both sacred and classical (Hanning 594). Their 'shared journey of discovery' had become, by Milton's time, an academic exercise so divorced from the practical realities of life as to render medieval education repulsive to Renaissance humanists in general, and to Milton in particular, for whom "the scholastic grossness of barbarous ages" did little more than immerse students in "unquiet deeps of controversy", leaving them with "ragged notions and babblements" and "such things chiefly as were better unlearned" (Milton 54; hereafter cited by page number alone). Milton dismissed the medieval curriculum which produced such scholars as the "scragged and thorny lectures of monkish and miserable sophistry" (Lewalski 208), and sought to liberate it from the scholastic yoke from which he believed it desperately needed rescuing.

===The Medieval curriculum===
[[File:Comput digital Raban Maur.jpg|thumb|Numerical finger codes, from the ''De Numeris'' by [[Raban Maur]], thirteenth century.]]

The medieval curriculum was characterised throughout by a preoccupation with the speculative. It began with the [[trivium (education)|trivium]], which included the study of grammar, rhetoric and dialectic. Grammar instruction dominated the early years of a student's education, where the focus, as Witt explains, was exclusively linguistic:  “…in a school program where the student aimed at perfecting a prose style largely divorced from classical precedents, the emphasis in teaching grammar fell on providing instruction more in the mechanics of the language than in ancient literature” (26). The trivium laid the groundwork for the [[quadrivium]], which turned its attention to the theoretical in the world of number, including the study of arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy. These two foundational programmes prepared the medieval university student for the study of philosophy and theology with its heavy emphasis on dialectical reasoning.

===Milton's proposed curriculum===
Milton is clear in the tract about the "many mistakes" that encumbered the medieval curriculum, which he censures as making "learning generally so unpleasing and unsuccessful" (53) in his time. His first target is the instruction of grammar. Milton is critical both of the amount of time spent on it as well as its mechanical emphasis:  “we do amiss to spend seven or eight years merely in scraping together so much miserable Latin and Greek as might be learned otherwise easily and delightfully in one year” (53).  Progress, in his view, is delayed by unnecessarily “forcing the empty wits of children to compose theme, verses, and orations” (53); instead, he proposes that after some foundational grammatical instruction, students should “be won early to the love of virtue” by having “some easy and delightful book of education” from among the ancient classics read to them (56).  The objective is not simply to teach grammar, but to “inflame [students] with the study of learning” (56). This, for Milton, was best accomplished through the reading of great literature.

After grammar, Milton takes up the cause of curricular sequence. He derides the medieval practice of “present[ing] their young unmatriculated novices, at first coming, with the most intellective abstractions of logic and metaphysics” after having only recently left "those grammatic flats and shallows where they stuck unreasonably to learn a few words with lamentable construction" (54). Instead, he proposes “beginning with arts most easy”; that is to say, those "most obvious to the sense" (54). His method, as Riggs notes, is an inductive one, starting with the study of "sensible things" (52), and progressing to "things invisible" only after mastering the former (Riggs 450). This move effectively inverts the deductive method common in medieval education. The "organic arts" of rhetoric and logic therefore find a place at the end of Milton's curriculum, rather than at the beginning (59). Noteworthy too is Milton's inclusion of poetry amongst the other organic arts: “poetry would be made subsequent, or indeed, rather precedent, as being less subtle and fine, but more simple, sensuous, and passionate” (60).
 
Milton’s proposed curriculum, encompassing as it does grammar, arithmetic, geometry, religion, agriculture, geography, astronomy, physics, trigonometry, ethics, economics, languages, politics, the law, theology, church history as well as the “organic arts” of poetry, [[rhetoric]] and [[logic]], is encyclopaedic in scope. His main thrust in the educational enterprise remains, however, on that practical erudition which would serve both the individual in a moral sense and the state in a public sense, equipping people “to be brave men and worthy patriots, dear to God and famous to all ages” (56). This stands in contrast to the contemplative and speculative concerns of
medieval education.

===Influences from Renaissance humanism===
As Ainsworth points out, “Milton, like other genuine humanists, cared little for virtue apart from practice, or for talent without principle” (15). Milton's desire to marry scholarly pursuits to commitments of a professional and public nature is, as Ainsworth implies, an over-riding characteristic of [[Renaissance humanism]] (Witt 34). Briefly stated, the humanist educational agenda of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries included “a clearer consciousness, among teachers and students, of education as a discipline for active life”, combined with "an insistence on the more extensive reading of ancient writers both classical and Christian as a means of securing this discipline" and "an attitude of severe and hostile criticism toward medieval education and culture" (Ainsworth 8).

===The changing demands of society===
The shift in educational concerns evident in the Renaissance was informed by the changing structure of society at this time. The ecclesiastical world of the Middle Ages, which was well served by its clerics, slowly gave way, in the sixteenth century, to a burgeoning bureaucratic world, served by the clerks who oiled the machinery of government, “keeping records, accounts, and correspondence” (Viswanathan 349). A linguistic and salvational emphasis in education was no longer tenable as the [[Puritans]] came to demand a general and practical education for their children. Education thus became concerned with "instilling into students a consciousness of themselves as national subjects" where moral concerns were public as well as private (Viswanathan 350). Milton's tractate fits well into this trajectory in its accommodation of education "to the needs of an age" (Ainsworth 42).

In April 2014 [[Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada|Industry Canada]] launched Digital Canada&amp;nbsp;150, which aims to support "connecting, and protecting Canadians, economic opportunities, digital government and Canadian content."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[CANARIE]] is a federally funded corporation that manages and develops digital research infrastructure for research and education, operating the backbone network of Canada's National Research and Education Network. Along with the [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council]]'s (NRC) Knowledge Management and the [[Canadian Association of Research Libraries]], CANARIE supports Research Data Canada in meeting researcher needs in the coordination and promotion of data management. The strategy includes developing [[open science]] and open data to facilitate easy and open access to publications and related data resulting from federally funded research.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Creative Commons Canada ====
The creation and use of OER benefits from the development and use of Creative Commons licences, which provide the legal framework to share these resources. A non-profit organization, Creative Common Canada (CC Canada) supports a legal and technical infrastructure for openness. It has created a set of free licensing tools permitting authors and developers to share, re-use and remix materials with an explicit "some rights reserved but others clearly allowed" approach to copyright. As an affiliate of the larger body, CC Canada is a collaborative initiative made up of the [[Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic]] (CIPPIC) at the [[University of Ottawa]], BCcampus, and [[Athabasca University]] (AU).

In addition to helping users choose licences and find Creative Commons-licensed work, CC Canada is a proponent of [[open government]] and the philosophy that government data should be accessible, shareable and reusable under open licences by everyone. It is actively involved in this pursuit, studying how CC licences can be used by governments to make data freely available for public use. Another CC Canada project is being spearheaded by its legal team at CIPPIC, which is researching the development of user-friendly tools that will provide comprehensive knowledge on how to analyse and use different open licences. CC Canada has also launched a series of conferences across the country to raise awareness of Creative Commons and its potential for educators, writers, artists, and others. In May 2014, Ryan Merkley, a Canadian, was appointed CEO of Creative Commons worldwide.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Council of Ministers of Education of Canada ====
The Council of Ministers of Education of Canada (CMEC) is an organization of 13 provincial and territorial ministries of education. In response to [[UNESCO 2012 Paris OER Declaration|UNESCO's 2012 Paris Declaration on OER]], CMEC first discussed OER at a national meeting in 2012. The Ministers reaffirmed their commitment to open access and to adapt educational practices to the new realities of information sharing. After further discussions in 2013, the ministers unanimously endorsed the Paris Declaration. This has played an important role in the growing support for OER across Canada and has been instrumental in the establishment of OER initiatives in the western provinces.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Tri-agency open access policy ====
The three Canadian research-funding agencies&amp;nbsp;– the [[Canadian Institutes of Health Research]] (CIHR), the [[Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council|Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada]] (NSERC) and the [[Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council|Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada]] (SSHRC)&amp;nbsp;– have agreed on a draft policy supporting open access in scholarly publications. These agencies strongly support knowledge sharing and research collaboration, both domestically and internationally.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== National and international initiatives ===
Several OER initiatives in Canada feature national and international collaboration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== OER universitas ====
[[OER Universitas|OER universitas]] (OERu) offers free online university courses in collaboration with Canadian partners, offering formal credentials from the partner institutions. OERu is a consortium of more than 36 institutions and several organizations on five continents. It is dedicated to widening access and reducing the cost of post-secondary education for learners by providing OER pathways to achieve formal credentials.&lt;ref&gt;McGreal, R., Mackintosh, W., &amp; Taylor, J. (2013). Open Educational Resources university: An assessment and credit for students' initiative. In R. McGreal, W. Kinutha, &amp; S. Marshall (Eds.), ''Open Educational Resources: Innovation research and practice''. Vancouver: Commonwealth of Learning. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.col.org/PublicationDocuments/&lt;/nowiki&gt; pub_PS_OER-IRP_web.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; There are seven members of the OERu in Canada: three universities (Athabasca in Alberta and [[Thompson Rivers University|Thompson Rivers]] and [[Kwantlen Polytechnic University|Kwantlen]] in British Columbia); one community college ([[Portage College]] in Alberta); and three organisations (BCcampus, eCampus Alberta, and [[Contact North]] in Ontario).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== BCcampus ====
BCcampus, arguably the most-active collaborative Canadian organization in the open practices arena, is a publicly funded service that has turned to open concepts and methods to create a sustainable approach to online learning for the public post-secondary institutions of British Columbia (BC). BCcampus was created to enhance students' ability not only to identify, choose, register for and take courses, but also to apply any academic credits earned to credentials at a selected home institution. It was intended to benefit institutions through the rationalization of demand for academic opportunities from students with the supply of online courses from BC's public post-secondary institutions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

BCcampus has been the leader in Canada in promoting OER with CMEC. BCcampus played a major role in the decision by the BC Ministry of Advanced Education, Innovation and Technology to support and implement the Open Textbook Project, which started with a commitment to provide 40 [[open textbook]]s at the post-secondary level and is now committed to 60.&lt;ref&gt;BCcampus. (2014, February 20). 5 questions with Mary Burgess on our Open Textbook Project and the future of open education. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://bccampus&lt;/nowiki&gt;. ca/2014/02/20/5-questions-with-mary-burgess-on-our-open-textbook-project-and-the-future-of-open-education/&lt;/ref&gt; BCcampus hosted a working forum on OER for senior post-secondary institution representatives in Vancouver in October 2012, with the objective of developing a common understanding of what OER could mean for the province and of building a shared vision of how to develop and use the resources. The session also studied ways that BC could take advantage of the promise of OER and, specifically, of open textbooks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The BCcampus Shareable Online Learning Resources repository (SOL*R) enables the licensing of, contribution to, and access to free online teaching and learning resources. Other BCcampus initiatives are also underway in support of OER, incluidng: the implementation of an initiative around apprenticeships for the trades, in partnership with BC's Industry Training Authority; and work with the North American Network of Science Labs Online (NANSLO) to build on the success of the Remote Web-based Science Laboratory (RWSL) and open educational science courseware.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Alberta OER====

The Campus Alberta Open Educational Resources (ABOER) Initiative was a 3-year $2&amp;nbsp;million government-funded initiative designed to assist with reducing the costs of a post-secondary education for students; and to provide students and faculty members with flexibility, offering updated, relevant content for learning. In March 2013, the Alberta Ministry of Innovation and Advanced Education entered a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with BC and Saskatchewan to collaborate on the development of common OER within their respective advanced-education sectors, recognizing the benefits of sharing existing OER with a focus on mutual areas of interest. This MOU was foundational to the establishment of the ABOER Initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://albertaoer.com/content/aboer-projects|title=Campus ABOER Initiative {{!}} oer.ualberta.ca|website=albertaoer.com|access-date=2017-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through partnerships with BCcampus, the initiative launched an ABOER Collection within SOL*R for open educational resources created or adapted by Albertans.

The ABOER Initiative funded over forty grant projects in Alberta across 31 publicly funded post-secondary institutions. In March 2017, program evaluation reported $482,000 in cost savings after one term (fall 2016) of open textbook adoption and forecasted cost savings of $5.5&amp;nbsp;million over five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9wIdVxGbvSdZkFzM25GanFuNmM/view?usp=sharing|title=Campus Alberta OER Initiative Program Evaluation|last=McNutt|first=Krysta|last2=Brailey|first2=Michelle|date=March 31, 2017|website=www.albertaoer.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A broader evaluation of cost savings including the adoption of ABOER-funded OER development and results of awareness initiatives remains to be evaluated. The report indicates an estimated one year of OER adoption to recuperate the investment of resource development.

eCampus Alberta (closed March 2017) funded the development of an OER awareness course&lt;ref&gt;[https://moodle.gprc.ab.ca/course/view.php?id=6979 Open Educational Resources Awareness Course]&lt;/ref&gt; and peer review of BCcampus OER.

The work of the ABOER Initiative and eCampus Alberta continued through a provincial OER Community of Practice (CoP),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albertaoer.com/community Alberta OER Community of Practice (CoP)]&lt;/ref&gt; intended to encourage open educational practices in Alberta. In May 2017, [[University of Alberta]] hosted the first Alberta OER Summit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RBt3v5tRR6evuvBJJN63fuhwJKYQMS6RFhGb31qs7Iw/view Alberta OER Summit]&lt;/ref&gt;

====eCampus Ontario====

eCampusOntario.ca is the primary face of the Ontario Online Learning Consortium (OOLC), a not-for-profit corporation whose membership is composed of all publicly-funded colleges and universities in Ontario, and whose funding comes from the Government of Ontario. {{As of|2016|September|12|df=US|post=,}} eCampus Ontario is led by CEO, David Porter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecampusontario.ca/news/bcit-associate-vice-president-dr-david-porter-selected-as-new-ceo-of-ecampusontario|title=eCampus Ontario|website=eCampus Ontario|language=en|access-date=2017-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a background in leading the open education movement in British Columbia with SFU, BCcampus, and BCIT, eCampus Ontario has already begun to bring OER and practices to the forefront of Ontario's education system. OER initiatives from eCampus Ontario include $2.6&amp;nbsp;million in open research and innovation funding,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecampusontario.ca/news/ecampusontario-awards-26-million-in-research--innovation-funding|title=eCampus Ontario|website=eCampus Ontario|language=en|access-date=2017-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; an open textbook library, and a collaborative project with [[Ryerson University]] to create an open publishing platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecampusontario.ca/news/ecampusontario-ryerson-university-to-create-open-publishing-infrastructure-for-ontario-post-secondary-educators-learners|title=eCampus Ontario|website=eCampus Ontario|language=en|access-date=2017-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Institutional initiatives ===

==== Athabasca University ====
There has been, and continues to be, significant OER activity at [[Athabasca University]] (AU). It was the first university in Canada to join the [[OpenCourseWare|OpenCourseWare Consortium]] (now the Open Education Consortium [OEC]) and, as of 2014, remains the only Canadian institutional member. The Province of Alberta and AU hosted the 2015 OEC conference in [[Banff, Alberta|Banff]], with over 250&amp;nbsp;delegates from more than 26&amp;nbsp;countries. AU was also given an OEC ACE Award in 2014 for its highly visible OER research website, the OER Knowledge Cloud.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

AU is home to the Technology Enhanced Knowledge Research Institute (TEKRI) and the [[UNESCO]]/COL/ICDE Chair in OER, both of which promote research into, and the implementation of, OER at institutional, national, and international levels. The OER Chair is also a member of the board of the OER Foundation, which hosts the OER universitas (OERu).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

AU's adoption of open access began with the creation of the scholarly journal ''International Review of Research in Open and Distributed Learning'' (IRRODL) in 1999, and continued in 2005 with the implementation of AUSpace, a [[DSpace]] repository of scholarly articles, theses and other documents produced within the AU community. AUPress was the first open access university press in Canada, starting in 2010, and offers over 100 volumes. Other AU open initiatives include participating in workshops and conferences, conducting a mapping of open educational activities with POERUP (policies for OER uptake) and eMundus Europrojects, and supporting GO-GN, the Global OER Graduate Network.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Thompson Rivers University Open Learning ====
Thompson Rivers University (TRU) houses the former BC Open University as its distance education wing, called [[Thompson Rivers University, Open Learning|TRU Open Learning]]. It is working with several OERu partner institutions to provide initial prototype courses to be released as OER. TRU Open Learning has a robust system for [[prior learning assessment and recognition]] (PLAR) that includes challenge examinations and transfer of credit. This makes it a key partner for OER initiatives nationally and internationally.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== OCAD University ====
The [[Inclusive Design Research Centre]] (IDRC), a research and development centre at [[OCAD University]] (formerly the Ontario College of Art and Design), consists of an international community of open practice advocates. The learning technologies and products that have been developed at by IDRC are distributed under the [[GNU General Public License|GNU General Public Licence]]. This means that the code is [[Open-source software|open source]] and requires users to share products under the same liberal licensing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A key project, FLOE (Flexible Learning for Open Education), is currently one of the IDRC's biggest initiatives. It has received substantial funding from the [[Hewlett Foundation]] and the [[European Commission]]. FLOE takes advantage of the fact that the centre has a set of curricula that is openly licensed and can be repurposed and re-used to make content accessible. This makes FLOE heavily dependent on OER, which presents an optimal learning environment to meet the needs of all learners, including those with disabilities. FLOE advances the strengths and values of open education and encourages pedagogical and technical innovation. It also promotes OER for content portability, ease of updating, internationalization and localization, content re-use and repurposing, and more efficient and effective content discovery. FLOE's work is international and broad. For example, to support adoption in Africa and other areas where mobile devices are more prevalent than Internet access, FLOE creates tools and services for delivery as OER via audio, text messages, and the small screens found on popular cellphones. These same tools and services are intended to support accessibility through inclusive design.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Contact North ====
[[Contact North]] (CN) is Ontario's distance education and training network. It provides programming from public colleges, universities and schools with a focus on smaller towns, rural and remote communities. In 2011, Contact North published "Open Educational Resources (OER) Opportunities for Ontario", a major position paper stating the case for a provincial OER initiative.&lt;ref&gt;Contact North. (2011, October). ''Open educational resources (OER) opportunities for Ontario''. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://oerknowledgecloud.org/?q=content/open-&lt;/nowiki&gt; educational-resources-oer-opportunities-ontario&lt;/ref&gt; Contact North has also published an OER primer as a video series.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Téléuniversité du Québec (TÉLUQ) ====
[[TÉLUQ]]'s policies on the dissemination of educational resources were presented in "Politique de gestion de la di usion des ressources d'enseignement et d'apprentissage" (REA). These policies relate to learning content in general and could include OER, but are also designed for proprietary content. Because TÉLUQ faculty retain the intellectual property of all original material they produce for teaching, institutional policy has limited impact on what professors do with their material. Laboratoire en Informatique Cognitive et Environnements de Formation (LICEF) is a research centre at TÉLUQ, and hosts the Banques des ressources éeducatives en réseau (brer), a repository of French-language OER.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Massive open online courses ==
{{Main|Massive open online course}}

Massive open online courses (MOOCs) are Canadian in origin. The name dates to an experimental course led by [[George Siemens]] at the University of Manitoba and [[Stephen Downes]] at the [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council]] in 2008 (Tamburri, 2014). They taught a regular online university credit course, "Connectivism and Connective Knowledge",&lt;ref&gt;Downes, S., &amp; Siemens, G. (2008). Connectivism and connective knowledge. The Daily Archives. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://connect.downes.ca/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; with 25 students; and more than 2,200 additional learners joined the course online. As Siemens reports, this course, delivered in 2008, was the first MOOC to combine open content with open teaching. This concept was developed from the idea of an open wiki pioneered by [[David A. Wiley]] at Utah State University and a 2007 open-boundary graduate course facilitated by Dr. Alec Couros at the University of Regina, in which 20 registered students were joined by approximately 200 non-credit international students.&lt;ref&gt;Siemens, G. (2012). MOOCs are really a platform. ''Elearnspace''. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/2012/07/25/moocs-are-really-a-&lt;/nowiki&gt; platform/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''opportunity trap''' is the social congestion in the competition for jobs when the number of applicants outstrips the demand for a particular group of workers – in particular, graduate school degree-holding applicants. It is distinct from the [[Equal opportunity|opportunity gap]] which refers to a lack of [[equal opportunity]]. An example of fields where the number of applicants far outstrips the available opportunities includes [[humanities]] [[professor]]s. Large numbers of graduate students complete [[PhD]] programs in [[English literature]], [[history]] and [[music history]], but there are only a handful of openings for professor positions. The PhD graduates who cannot find professor positions may experience [[underemployment]], such as working at a job which does not require their education (e.g., working at [[Starbucks]]).

==Overview==
Many commentators, including [[human capital]] theorists and proponents of positional consensus theory, assert that there is a tightening relationship between education, jobs and rewards, and that in general, the more qualifications you have, the more employable you are. These ideas have informed policies to widen access to educational opportunities with the goal of promoting equality and maximising efficiency according to [[meritocratic]] ideals. However, it can be argued that this perspective fails to take into account the positional nature of qualifications – that is, an individual’s chances of getting a certain job are dependent both on their own skills and qualifications, and the skills and qualifications of the other applicants and on the number of other qualified applicants. Qualifications have both an absolute and a relative value – which diminishes the more people hold them. For example, in a society where 50% of the working population hold university degrees, they will be less valuable than in a society where only 5% hold them.
==Academic inflation==
{{Main|Academic inflation}}
Taking this relative quality of qualifications into account, it can be argued that widening participation in higher education and qualifications will not necessarily deliver the rewards that human capital theorists have suggested, if the number of graduate degree-requiring jobs does not increase accordingly, and will instead lead to [[academic inflation]]:

:‘If only a few adopt the same tactics to get ahead, such as intensifying efforts to get into a top university, do volunteer work to add value to one’s resume, or work late to impress the boss, it stands a chance of success. But if everyone adopts the same tactics, then no one gets ahead; it simply raises the entry bar or increases the number of hurdles’  

According to this perspective, if everyone holds the same credentials no one gets ahead and the result is a kind of social congestion around sought-after jobs. [[Phillip Brown (sociologist)|Brown]] describes this as an "opportunity trap" since few individuals are able to opt out of the competition for jobs and are compelled to strive for credentials in order to be considered employable.  It is also argued that in this context of an increasing pool of graduate applicants, employers have been propelled to a stronger position of power as they are increasingly able to demand more from potential employees in a [[reverse auction]]. It has also been argued that this process has been exacerbated by [[offshoring]] and practices of [[Digital Taylorism]] in the workplace.

{{Childcare}}

'''Pre-kindergarten''' (also called '''Pre-K''' or '''PK''') is a [[classroom]]-based [[preschool]] program for children below the age of five in the United States, Canada and Turkey (when [[kindergarten]] starts).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.seattlepi.com/age-can-start-prek-georgia-5429.html|title=At What Age Can You Start Pre-K in Georgia?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y1C0DAAAQBAJ|title=The SAGE Encyclopedia of Contemporary Early Childhood Education|first1=Donna|last1=Couchenour|first2=J. Kent|last2=Chrisman|date=16 August 2016|publisher=SAGE Publications|via=Google Books|isbn=9781483340340}}{{pn|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be delivered through a [[preschool]] or within a reception year in [[elementary school (United States)|elementary school]]. Pre-kindergartens play an important role in [[early childhood education]]. They have existed in the US since 1922, normally run by private organizations. The U.S. [[Head Start (program)|Head Start]] program, the country's first federally funded pre-kindergarten program, was founded in 1967. This attempts to prepare children (especially disadvantaged children) to succeed in school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Andrews |first1=Shirley P. |last2=Slate |first2=John R. |title=Public and private prekindergarten programs: A comparison of student readiness |journal=Educational Research Quarterly |date=March 2002 |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=59–73 |url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/1fd9d6a85609b39e6644082a990af151/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=48020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
The term "pre-kindergarten" is often used interchangeably with the concepts of "nursery care" and "[[child care]]"; however, these other early childhood settings focus their goal on substitutionary care for children while their legal parents/guardians are absent as opposed to pre-K's focus on skill building. They could involve academic training, or they could involve solely [[socialization|socializing]] activities.

Pre-kindergartens, though, differentiate themselves by ''equally'' focusing on building a child's (1) [[social]] development, (2) physical development, (3) [[emotion]]al development, and (4) [[cognitive]] development. They commonly follow a set of organization-created teaching standards in shaping curriculum and instructional activities/goals. The term "[[preschool]]" more accurately approximates the name "pre-kindergarten", for both focus on harvesting the same four child development areas in subject-directed fashion. The term "[[preschool]]" often refers to such schools that are owned and operated as private or [[parochial school]]s. Pre-kindergartens refer to such school classrooms that function within a [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] under the supervision of a public school administrator and funded completely by state or federally allocated funds, and private donations.

Most school districts describe Pre-Kindergarten as "an early learning program to prepare children for kindergarten who are identified as at risk." Pre-kindergarten provides learning to children who are 4 years old on or before September 1. Preschool provides learning to children who are 3 years olds on or before September 1. Most programs are 3 hours but extended day is offered in some schools.

"K-2" is often (and controversially) used interchangeably with "pre-kindergarten". Although [[early childhood education]] experts criticize the use of the term as a way to rationalize utilizing a kindergarten model and teaching kindergarten skills in pre-kindergarten classes, public school districts continue to incorporate the term as a way to integrate pre-kindergarten into the stable of [[accountability]] under the [[No Child Left Behind Act]].

==Qualification==
To qualify for '''free''' pre-kindergarten in some states the child generally must be:

* 4 years old (some districts offer programs for 3-year-olds) on or before September 1 and meet one of the following criteria:
** Limited English Proficiency. (This refers to the United States only. In Canada and other countries, free pre-kindergarten programs may not necessarily be available to parents or may have different criteria for admission.)
** Economically Disadvantaged. Students qualifying as economically disadvantaged must meet the federal income eligibility guidelines. To qualify a family must have income below about 175% of the Annual Federal Poverty Guidelines (U.S.A.). 
** Homeless.
** The child of a parent in the military or injured or killed while actively serving in the military. Appropriate U.S. Department of Defense identification or documentation must be provided.
** In or have been in the conservatorship of the state. Appropriate documentation from the Department of Family and Protective Services must be provided.

"Pre-Kindergarten" may have different meanings in other countries. In India, this is also known as Nursery in Kindergartens such as Applekids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.applekidsblr.com|title=Apple Kids website|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programs ==

In 2013 Alabama, Michigan, Minnesota, and the city of San Antonio enacted or expanded Pre-K programs. In New York City new mayor [[Bill de Blasio]] was elected on a pledge of Pre-K for all city children. A poll conducted in July for an early education nonprofit advocate found that 60 percent of registered Republicans and 84 percent of Democrats supported expanding public preschool by raising the federal [[tobacco tax]].&lt;ref name=nyt1402&gt;{{cite news |title=Preschool Push Moving Ahead in Many States |first1=Richard |last1=Pérez-Peña |first2=Motoko |last2=Rich |date=February 3, 2014 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/04/us/push-for-preschool-becomes-a-bipartisan-cause-outside-washington.html |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=October 14, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Funding for Pre-K has proven a substantial obstacle to creating and expanding programs. The issue produced multiple approaches. Several governors targeted existing budgets. San Antonio increased sales taxes, while Virginia and Maine look to gambling. In Oregon, currently 20% of kids have access to publicly funded Pre-K of any kind, and a 2016 campaign is working to fully fund Pre-K to 12 education, for all kids whose parents want them to have the option of Pre-K.&lt;ref name=nyt1402/&gt;&lt;ref name=ffos1&gt;{{cite news|title=Fully Fund Oregon Schools|url=https://fullyfundoregonschools.org|accessdate=March 6, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216015435/http://fullyfundoregonschools.org/|archivedate=February 16, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 review by the National Institute for Early Education Research at Rutgers University identified Oklahoma, Georgia and West Virginia as among the leaders in public program quality and fraction of enrolled children. Florida had the highest enrollment in 2012 — almost four-fifths of all four-year-olds. About 84 percent were in private, religion-based or family centers. That state's preschool programs did not fare well on quality measures. Other states with more than 50 percent enrollment included Wisconsin, Iowa, Texas and Vermont.&lt;ref name=nyt1402/&gt;

Florida was one of the first states to establish free prekindergarten. The programs offer a jump start to young children on their education. The program is open to all 4 and 5-year-olds who reside in Florida and have birthdays before September 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; of the current school year. Voluntary Pre-Kindergarten gives each child an opportunity to perform better in school and in the future. A strong emphasis is put on literacy skills, accountability, and smaller class sizes. These high-quality programs aid children in becoming strong readers and improving social and developmental skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.floridaearlylearning.com/vpk.aspx|title=VPK {{!}} Florida Office of Early Learning|website=www.floridaearlylearning.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several different programs for parents to choose from. They differentiate in class size, instructional hours, and teacher credentials. Florida VPK programs also offer specialized instruction for children with special needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.floridaearlylearning.com/vpk.aspx|title=VPK {{!}} Florida Office of Early Learning|website=www.floridaearlylearning.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benefits of the VPK program include better behavior, preparation for Kindergarten, and a promoted love of learning for children.

== Impact ==
A 2018 study in the ''[[Journal of Public Economics]]'' found in Italy that pre-kindergarten "increased mothers' participation in the labor market and lowered the reservation wage of the unemployed, thus increasing their likelihood of finding a job" but "did not affect children's cognitive development, irrespective of their family background."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jpubeco.2017.12.012 |title=Early kindergarten, maternal labor supply and children's outcomes: Evidence from Italy |journal=Journal of Public Economics |volume=158 |pages=79–102 |year=2018 |last1=Carta |first1=Francesca |last2=Rizzica |first2=Lucia }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The skills children learn at home are enhanced by placement in Pre-Kindergarten.

== Children of immigrants ==

The US Census Bureau forecast that the foreign born population in the United States would make up 19% of the US population by 2060 (up from 13% in 2014).&lt;ref&gt;Colby, S. &amp; Ortman, J. (2014). Projections of the Size and Composition of the U.S. Population: 2014 to 2060. Current Population Reports, P25-1143. U.S. Census Bureau.&lt;/ref&gt; Children of immigrant families face special challenges.

=== Cultural values and childcare options ===
Children of immigrants represent the fastest growing US population. Asians and Latinos are the two largest racial groups. Like all families, immigrants have choices when pursuing childcare options. Cultural differences influence childcare choices, such as attitudes towards early academic development. These differences help explain differences in childcare selection. Compared to Latino immigrant groups, Asians are more likely than Latinos to enroll their children in pre-kindergarten programs due to the inclusion of academics.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.childyouth.2013.04.024 |title=Predictors of early care and education type among preschool-aged children in immigrant families: The role of region of origin and characteristics of the immigrant experience |journal=Children and Youth Services Review |volume=35 |issue=9 |pages=1342–1355 |year=2013 |last1=Miller |first1=Portia |last2=Votruba-Drzal |first2=Elizabeth |last3=Coley |first3=Rebekah Levine }}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of pre-academic, school readiness is important to Asian parents. Latino immigrant parents by contrast generally opt for more informal childcare options, such as parental, relative or non-relative in-home care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1747-7379.2007.00060.x |title=Early Child Care and the School Readiness of Children from Mexican Immigrant Families |journal=International Migration Review |volume=41 |pages=152–181 |year=2018 |last1=Crosnoe |first1=Robert }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due in part to the opinion that academic skills are taught through formal instruction after children enter primary school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0002716208322765 |title=Disparities in the Educational Success of Immigrants: An Assessment of the Immigrant Effect for Asians and Latinos |journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science |volume=620 |pages=90–114 |year=2008 |last1=Harris |first1=Angel L. |last2=Jamison |first2=Kenneth M. |last3=Trujillo |first3=Monica H. }}&lt;/ref&gt; While Latino families value the acquisition of academic skills, the in-home childcare choice is a reflection of the importance of cultural and linguistic values and traditional family dynamics. Parents with limited English proficiency are more likely to choose parental or in-home care instead of pre-kindergarten programs.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

=== Barriers ===
According to information from the [[Survey of Income and Program Participation]] (SIPP) and the [[Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development|National Institute of Child Health and Human Development]] (NICHD), low-income immigrant families are less likely to use center-based childcare, such as pre-kindergarten, than children of non-immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.0020-7985.2004.00274.x |title=The Child Care Arrangements of Preschool-Age Children in Immigrant Families in the United States |journal=International Migration |volume=42 |pages=65–87 |year=2004 |last1=Brandon |first1=Peter D. }}&lt;/ref&gt; While some Latino families prefer in-home childcare, many report wanting to enroll their children in a pre-kindergarten program. Interviews with immigrant mothers revealed common motivations for seeking pre-kindergarten placements for their children, including maternal employment, opportunity to learn English and social and emotional development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ecresq.2013.02.001 |title=Low-income African and Latina immigrant mothers' selection of early childhood care and education (ECCE): Considering the complexity of cultural and structural influences |journal=Early Childhood Research Quarterly |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=470–486 |year=2013 |last1=Vesely |first1=Colleen K. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Obstacles immigrant mothers reported facing included high cost, long wait-lists, a need to provide documentation (especially for illegal aliens and those who lacked English-language proficiency) and a lack of information regarding eligibility for subsidized programs. On average, immigrants tend to experience higher poverty rates due to low wages, less education and a lack of English proficiency.

=== Benefits ===
While all children would benefit from pre-kindergarten and early childhood education, immigrant children, particularly those from lower socio-economic households, stand to benefit the most. Studies indicate that first and second generation immigrants lag behind children of non-immigrant families in cognitive and language skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ecresq.2009.07.004 |title=The early developmental competencies and school readiness of low-income, immigrant children: Influences of generation, race/ethnicity, and national origins |journal=Early Childhood Research Quarterly |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=411–431 |year=2009 |last1=De Feyter |first1=Jessica Johnson |last2=Winsler |first2=Adam }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-K's focus on cognitive, social, emotional and physical development would address these skills and reduce the inequalities in school readiness between children from immigrant and non-immigrant families. Educators must be sensitive to sensitivities of immigrant groups regarding the acquisition of the English language versus their native-language. Pre-K could help children build either or both skills. For most US students, English fluency is essential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/fare.12171 |title=Family Socioeconomic Status, Immigration, and Children's Transitions into School |journal=Family Relations |volume=65 |pages=73–84 |year=2016 |last1=Crosnoe |first1=Robert |last2=Ansari |first2=Arya }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Outline of physical science|physical sciences]] and [[natural science]] a '''predoctoral fellow''' ('''pre-doc''') refers to a researcher who has a [[bachelor's degree]], but not a [[doctorate]].  As the name implies, predoctoral fellows often use their time as a fellow to develop their skills and résumé before applying to [[graduate school]]. They differ from lab managers or technicians in that they primarily pursue research, rather than maintain the day-to-day function of a lab, and may have external funding to support their research or educational activities, but typically are also reliant on the support of a research mentor whose lab they work in.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence}}

In [[Mathematics]] and some Science disciplines, typically a pre-doc is somebody already registered in a Ph.D. program at a host university to work together with a professor in a different topic with respect to his/her topic.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=March 2017}}

'''Private universities''' (and '''private colleges''') are typically not operated by governments, although many receive [[tax breaks]], public [[student loans]], and [[grant (money)|grants]]. Depending on their location, private universities may be subject to government regulation. This is in contrast to [[public university|public universities]] and [[national university|national universities]]. Most private universities are [[non-profit organization]]s.

== Africa ==

=== Egypt ===
Egypt has many private universities, including [[The American University in Cairo]], the [[German University in Cairo]], The [[British University in Egypt]], the [[Arab Academy for Science, Technology and Maritime Transport]], [[Misr University for Science and Technology]], [[Misr International University]], [[Future University in Egypt]] and [[Modern Sciences and Arts University]].

=== Ghana ===
There were few private universities in Ghana before the beginning of the new millennium. Ghana has seen a flood of the establishment of private universities and colleges, which is a reflection of the country's stable governance and peaceful atmosphere, and most importantly the pace of economic growth. Most of these universities are not known to be sponsored by foreign corporate organisations and government universities, and the aim is to avoid the Ghana government's excessive payment of bond which is a requirement for all foreign institutions endeavouring to operate business in the country. Almost all the private universities in Ghana have a similar kind of academic discipline, like Business Administration, Human Resource, Accounting, Information Technology, etc., which are offered by universities like [[Ashesi University|Ashesi]], [[Regent University College of Science and Technology|Regent]], [[Valley View University|Valley View]], [[Ghana telecom university college|Ghana Telecom]] and many others. The recent discovery of oil and gas in commercial quantities has influenced the development of oil and gas management courses within the private universities' curriculum.

=== Libya ===
Libya has number of recognised private education institutions and universities, approved by the Ministry of Higher Education, ranked and qualified to specialise in academic programs in Business Administration, Computer Science, Law, Medicine and Humanitarian. These institutions include:

* Al Rifaq University for Humanitarian and Applied Science – Tripoli City
* Ibn Al Haytham Center for Technology Education and Scientific research – Tripoli City
* Libyan International Medical University – Benghazi City
* Libyan University for Humanitarian and Applied Science – Tajora City
* Tripoli Community University – Tripoli
* Tripoli Institute for Medical Sciences – Tripoli City
* United Africa University – Zawia City

=== Nigeria ===
The [[National Universities Commission]] of Nigeria has the responsibility to approve private universities and accredit their courses. This ensures a minimum standard in curriculum and teaching. There are currently 60 approved private universities in Nigeria and still counting as there are hundreds of application under processing.

=== South Africa ===
In [[South Africa]] there is a distinction between public universities and what the government calls private higher education institutions. [[Varsity College (South Africa)|Varsity College]], [[Vega (South Africa)|Vega]], [[The Design School Southern Africa]], [[Milpark]], [[Midrand Graduate Institute]], [[Regenesys Business School]], Akademia and Richfield Graduate Institute of Technology are all recognised as private higher education institutions.

== Asia ==

=== Bangladesh ===
A number of private universities were established in Bangladesh after the Private University Act, 1992 was instituted, and amended as the Private University Act 2010. All private universities must be approved by [[University Grants Commission (Bangladesh)|University Grants Commission]] (UGC) before they are given a permit to operate. See external links for: ''Private Universities Act 1992''.

As of 2014, there were 91 [[List of universities in Bangladesh#Private universities|private universities in Bangladesh]].

=== Brunei Darussalam ===
Private institutions must confer the students with external programmes such as BDTVEC (the largest awarding body in the country), [[Business and Technology Education Council|BTEC]] and [[Cambridge International Examinations]] pathways. Accreditation by Brunei Darussalam National Accreditation Council (BDNAC) is very crucial in order to establish a private institution.

=== Cambodia ===
Since 1997, private universities have been established in the Kingdom of Cambodia.

* [[IIC University of Technology]] (IICUT) – Phnom Penh
* [[Zaman University]] (ZAMANU) – Phnom Penh

=== China ===
Since 2003, joint-partnership private universities have been established in the People's Republic of China (PRC). Typically, the partners are a Chinese university and a non-Chinese institution. English is often the only language of instruction at such universities, and many focus on providing a comprehensive liberal arts education modeled after research universities in the United States and Europe.

There are 19 private universities in Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.higher-edu.gov.lb/index_ar.asp Lebanese Ministry of Higher Education website (in Arabic)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714184939/http://www.higher-edu.gov.lb/index_ar.asp |date=2007-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among these, the [[American University of Beirut]] and the [[Lebanese American University]] are internationally acknowledged.&lt;ref&gt;[http://csrd.lau.edu.lb/Publications/StudentReports/Education%20in%20Lebanon.htm Education in Lebanon, CSRD report, Lebanese American University, 2004] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070426090356/http://csrd.lau.edu.lb/Publications/StudentReports/Education%20in%20Lebanon.htm |date=2007-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The languages of teaching in private universities are mainly [[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]], while [[Arabic language|Arabic]] is widely used in religious universities and [[Armenian language|Armenian]] is used in the [[Armenia]]n university.

The first university opened in Lebanon was the Syrian Protestant College in 1866 (which became the American University of Beirut in 1921). It was founded by Daniel Bliss, a Protestant missionary. The second university opened in Lebanon was the [[Saint Joseph University|Université Saint-Joseph]], founded by the [[Jesuit]]s in 1875.

=== Pakistan ===

{{Main article|Higher Education Commission (Pakistan)}}
The Higher Education Commission (HEC), formerly the University Grant Commission (UGC), is the primary regulator of higher education in Pakistan. It also facilitates the development of the higher educational system in Pakistan. Its main purpose is to upgrade the schools to be world-class centres of education, research and development. It also plays a leading role towards building a knowledge-based economy in Pakistan by giving out hundreds of doctoral scholarships for education abroad every year.

In spite of the criticism of the HEC, its creation has also had a positive impact on higher education in Pakistan. Its two-year report for 2004 to 2006 states that according to the Institute of Scientific Information, the total number of publications appearing in the 8,000 leading journals indexed in the web of science arising out of Pakistan in 2005 was 1,259 articles, representing a 41% increase over the past two years and a 60% increase since the establishment of HEC in 2002. The HEC digital library now provides access to over 20,000 leading research journals, covering about 75% of the world's peer-reviewed scientific journals.

Until 1991, there were only two recognized private universities in Pakistan: [[Aga Khan University]], established in 1983 and [[Lahore University of Management Sciences]], established in 1985. By 1997, however, there were 10 private universities. In 2001–2002, this number had doubled to 20. Among the first to gain degree awarding status was [[Hajvery University, Lahore]] (HU), established in 1990. In 2003–2004 Pakistan had a total of 83 private degree granting institutions.

=== Saudi Arabia ===
There are nine private universities in Saudi Arabia:
* [[Al Yamamah University]]
* [[Alfaisal University]]
* [[Arab Open University]]
* [[Dar Al Uloom University]]&lt;ref name=mohe&gt;{{cite web|title=Private Universities|url=http://www.mohe.gov.sa/en/studyinside/privateedu/Pages/listphe.aspx|publisher=Ministry of Higher Education|accessdate=14 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120423075451/http://www.mohe.gov.sa/en/studyinside/privateedu/Pages/listphe.aspx|archivedate=23 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Singapore ===
[[Stansfield College]], founded in 1993, is a private higher education institution and a provider of the [[University of London International Programmes]] in [[Singapore]]. Through its collaboration with the [[University of London]], Stansfield offers undergraduate degrees and diplomas in a range of academic disciplines which include Law, the Humanities, and the EMFSS suite of programmes with specialisations in Accounting, Business &amp; Management, Banking &amp; Finance, Economics, Mathematics &amp; Economics and the Social Sciences.&lt;ref name="stansfield.edu.sg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stansfield.edu.sg|title=Stansfield College|work=Stansfield College|accessdate=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The college has also expanded its range of programmes to include several university foundation awards including certificate and diploma programmes that allow students to progress academically at Stansfield or to gain admissions into overseas universities. The college also provides postgraduate diplomas and executive development courses and seminars.&lt;ref name="stansfield.edu.sg" /&gt;

The college enrolls over 500, with students from over 30 countries studying at its campus.&lt;ref name="stansfield.edu.sg" /&gt;

[[Auston Institute of Management]] is another example of a private 'university' where students who study at the college receive university awards from degree-awarding partners overseas. Auston rose to fame in the early 2000s{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} with a collaboration with [[Coventry University]]. This partnership ended in 2012 and was replaced with new partners including [[London South Bank University]], [[University of Wolverhampton]], [[Birmingham City University]], [[Chichester University]] and [[De Montfort University]]. Auston is known for its hands-on approach and its emphasis in technical areas of study such as electronics, mechatronics, computer security, and various forms of software engineering.&lt;ref name="auston.edu.sg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auston.edu.sg|title=Auston - Engineering, Computing and Business Degrees &amp; Diplomas|publisher=|accessdate=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Auston graduates about 400 students per year from as many as eight different countries, all studying in Singapore for UK degree awards.&lt;ref name="auston.edu.sg"/&gt;

=== Sri Lanka ===
[[Sri Lanka]] does not officially recognise private universities, but does not explicitly forbid them either.But there are many private institutes(these institutes are registered under the company act), and several independent institutions that are non-government funded. These mostly provide undergraduate degrees, with a limited few proving postgraduate degrees. The Informatics Institute of Sri Lanka (IIT),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iit.ac.lk/ www.iit.ac.lk]&lt;/ref&gt; Horizon Campus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.horizoncampus.edu.lk/|title=Horizon Campus|publisher=|accessdate=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Sri Lanka Institute for Information Technology (SLIIT)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sliit.lk/|title=Home - Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology|work=Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology|accessdate=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; are examples. Some foreign universities franchise parts of their degree courses in Sri Lanka with local institutes. Students are charged for the study (some of these institutes are state funded institutions of their home countries) and these charges are often a fraction of the cost studying in the home countries of these institutions.

Efforts to establish private universities have been blocked due to protests from state universities' undergraduates and leftist political parties.

However many private colleges have sprung up one of which is the affiliated campus of [[Auston Institute of Management, Singapore]]. The Sri Lanka campus was established in 2010 and is a [[Board of Investment or (BOI)]] company. It retains a similar focus to the home campus and occupies a prime spot along Colombo's famous Galle Road.&lt;ref name="auston.edu.lk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auston.edu.lk|title=- Engineering and Project Management College in Sri Lanka|work=Auston|accessdate=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Auston has been visited by many foreign universities and continues to expand its provision of titles in engineering and computing.&lt;ref name="auston.edu.lk"/&gt;

=== Taiwan ===
In Taiwan, unlike the United States, private universities are typically not as prestigious as some public (national) universities. They are not as highly ranked as public institutions, and also cost nearly twice as much. This is due to the form of testing in schools in Taiwan, in which students take a national entrance exam to determine their university qualifications. The famous private university is [[Fu Jen Catholic University]], and the earliest is [[Tunghai University]].

=== Vietnam ===
Since the 1990s a lot of private universities have opened in Vietnam.  Hochiminh City Open University was one of the first. Typical characteristics of Vietnamese private universities {{as of | 2010 | lc = on}} are higher (very high in some cases) tuition fees, poor infrastructure, and limited faculty and human resources.

Private universities are often named after scholars (Fulbright University [[William Fulbright]], Vo Truong Toan University, [[Nguyen Trai]] University, Luong The Vinh University, Chu Van A University, [[Yersin]] University, [[Phan Chau Trinh]] University), or heroes/legends ([[Hung Vuong]] University, [[Quang Trung]] University), although there are exceptions, such as [[FPT University]], named after the FPT Group and [[Tan Tao University]], in [[Tan Tao Group]].

In Vietnam, there exists the "semi-private university"; schools in this category can receive partial financial support from the government. Almost all private universities have to invite professors and lecturers from the state universities. Many lecturers from state-owned universities take up positions in private universities after their retirement.

== Europe ==

=== Austria ===
In [[Austria]], educational institutions must be authorised by the country to legally grant [[academic degree]]s. All state-run universities are governed by the 2002 Austrian Universities' and University Degree Programmes' Organisation Act (Federal Law Gazette No. 120/2002). In 1999, a federal law (''Universitäts-Akkreditierungsgesetz'') was passed to allow the [[School accreditation|accreditation]] of private universities. The ''Akkreditierungsrat'' (Accreditation Council)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.akkreditierungsrat.at/ Official website – ''Akkreditierungsrat'']&lt;/ref&gt;  evaluates applicants and issues recommendations to the responsible Austrian accreditation authority (the Austrian Federal Ministry of Science &amp; Research).

Accreditation by the council yields a couple of privileges: degrees issued by accredited private universities have the same legal status as those issued by state-run universities. Private universities can appoint or promote [[professor]]s. Their students enjoy the same privileges pertaining to social security, foreigner law and state scholarships as students of the state universities. Educational services of private universities are not subject to [[value added tax]], and donations are tax deductible.

Accreditations must be renewed regularly and can be withdrawn, e.g. in the case of repeated academic misconduct as happened in 2003 when the accreditation of [[International University Vienna]] was withdrawn. In 2006, when the accreditation of [[Imadec Executive Education|Imadec University]] expired, the Accreditation Council rejected requests for renewal.

Austrian law provides that private universities in Austria must use the term ''Privatuniversität'' (literally, "private university") in their [[German language|German]] names, although their formal names in other languages are not regulated. Thus, there is the possibility of private institutions employing the term "university" as opposed to "private university" in their advertisements in all languages except German while still complying with Austrian law.

While the legal definition of "private university" prohibits funding by the federal government of Austria, funding by other public bodies is not prohibited. Consequently, some of Austria's private universities are partly or wholly funded by provincial governments, while others are fully privately funded.

Accreditation of private universities began in 2001. {{As of | 2010}} Austria has 12 private universities. Most are small (fewer than 1000 students) and specialise in only one or two fields of study:

* [[Anton Bruckner Private University for Music, Drama, and Dance]] – [[Linz]]
* [[Catholic-Theological Private University Linz]]
* Danube Private University – [[Krems an der Donau]]
* [[European Peace University]] – [[Stadtschlaining]]
* [[Karl Landsteiner University]] – [[Krems an der Donau]]
* [[Konservatorium Wien]] – [[Vienna]]
* [[MODUL University Vienna]] (2007)
* [[New Design University]] – [[St. Pölten]]
* Paracelsus Medizinische Privatuniversität – [[Salzburg]]
* Privatuniversität Schloss Seeburgin Seekirchen – near Salzburg
* [[Sigmund Freud University Vienna]]
* University for Health Sciences, Medical Informatics and Technology – [[Hall in Tirol]]
* [[Webster University Vienna]] (also accredited in the [[US]])

Four former private universities are '''not accredited''' any more:
* [[International University Vienna]]: Accreditation was withdrawn in 2003 due to academic misconduct.
* [[Imadec Executive Education|Imadec University]]: First accreditation period ended in January 2006 and was not renewed.
* TCM Privatuniversität Li Shi Zhen in [[Vienna]]: Accreditation period ended 2009; TCM did not call for renewal. All students could finish their studies.
* [[PEF Private University of Management Vienna]]: The university closed for economic reasons in March 2012. All students could finish their studies.

=== Bulgaria ===
[[Bulgaria]] has a number of private universities, among which the most renowned are [[New Bulgarian University]], located in the capital city [[Sofia]]; Burgas Free University; [[Varna Free University]]; and [[American University in Bulgaria]].

=== Finland ===
[[Finland]] does not officially recognise private universities, but does not explicitly forbid them either. [[Helsinki School of Business]] is an example of one such educational institution operating in this market.

=== France ===
[[France]] has a dual system: universities and ''[[grandes écoles]].''

It is forbidden by law for a private institution to be called "university",&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Code de l'éducation - Article L731-14|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do;jsessionid=DE788FC36D1C3DEF7F1BE6989ABCDD09.tplgfr30s_2?idArticle=LEGIARTI000027748361&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006071191&amp;dateTexte=20180417|accessdate=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and almost all universities are public. Some private institutions still openly call themselves "universities", such as the [[Lille Catholic University]], even if this has no legal basis. Universities provide courses in all academic fields (engineering, law, medical, economics, arts, business administration, sociology). One may join university after a high school degree and study there for a ''licence'' (bachelor), master's degree, or doctoral program, although again by law private institutions may not grant degrees called ''licence'' or ''doctorat''.

''Grandes écoles'' can be public or private, but the most prestigious ones are public. These institutions operate mostly in engineering studies and business administration. Universities and ''grandes écoles'' compete in these two fields. Some of them report to the Ministry of Higher Education, such as [[Arts et Métiers ParisTech]] and [[Ecole Centrale Paris|École Centrale Paris]], and a few to the Ministry of Defense, such as [[Ecole Polytechnique|École Polytechnique]]. Several private ''grandes écoles'' are members of the [[Conférence des grandes écoles (CGE)|''Conférence des Grandes Écoles'']], a lobbying group representing grandes écoles. Most ''grandes écoles'' can be joined after following two years of ''[[classe préparatoire aux grandes écoles]]'', an intensive program following the ''[[baccalauréat]]''. A selective examination after the two additional years is taken to enter a ''grande école''. Following the [[Bologna Process]], this full 5 year cursus (two years of preparatory classes plus 3 years in engineering or business school) is equivalent to a master's degree.

Grandes écoles for studying business administration are usually part of the [[Chamber of commerce|chambers of commerce]]. For example, [[HEC Paris|HEC]] is part of the Chamber of Commerce of Paris ([[Paris Chamber of Commerce|CCIP]]), and is therefore semi-private.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

=== Germany ===
[[Germany]] has 83 private universities (called ''Privathochschule'') and 45 church-run universities (called ''kirchliche Hochschule''). Similar to the state-run universities, they are subdivided into ''Universitäten'' (research universities), ''[[Fachhochschule]]n'' (universities of applied science) and ''Kunst- und Musikhochschulen'' ([[art school]]s). Private universities in Germany need institutional accreditation by the state.

The first private university in Germany, the Ukrainian Free University, was established 16 September 1950 in Munich. [[Witten/Herdecke University]] opened in 1982 and [[Zeppelin University]] in 2003. Though private universities are numerous in Germany, they represent only less than 1% of all students. Some private universities, including [[Hanseatic University Rostock]] (2007–2009) and the International University in Germany in [[Bruchsal]], have gone out of business.

Most of the church universities are run by the Protestant or Catholic churches; however, there is one Jewish university (''Hochschule für Jüdische Studien'') in [[Heidelberg]].

=== Greece ===
In [[Greece]] private universities are prohibited by [[Constitution of Greece|the constitution]] (Article 16).  However, [[Laboratory of Liberal Studies|laboratories of liberal studies]] (Εργαστήρια ελευθέρων σπουδών, ergastiria eleftheron spoudon) operate freely in the country, and, based on a law from the 1930s they are registered as private for-profit businesses and regulated by the [[Greek Ministry of Commerce]].  Their academic degrees, which are not recognised in Greece, are directly provided to students by foreign universities in the [[United Kingdom]], [[United States of America]], or other countries, usually through [[Franchising|franchise]] or [[validation (education)|validation]] agreements (the franchise agreement usually being considered better).  This has limited access to the laboratories, which usually teach in English, to high-income Greeks who for various reasons (usually family matters) did not want to go abroad.

In 2008 a law was introduced that forced all private institutions collaborating with foreign universities to offer programmes in the country, to register with the [[Greek Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs]] as ''[[college]]s'' (κολλέγια, kollegia) by August 2009. Further amendments to the framework in 2010, 2012 and 2013 (4111/2013, 4093/2012) were introduced. Today there are a series of private colleges mostly offering programmes in Business Administration and other fields.

=== Ireland ===
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], a private university (more commonly known as a ''private college'') is one that is not funded by the state, and therefore not covered by the free-fees initiative. All [[List of universities in the Republic of Ireland|universities]], [[Regional Technical College|institutes of technology]], [[College of Education|colleges of education]], and the [[National College of Ireland]] and some religious institutions are publicly funded and therefore covered by ''free-fees'' initiative. There are few private colleges, and they are highly specialised, such as [[Griffith College Dublin]], [[Dorset College]] and [[Dublin Business School]]. The major representative body for private colleges in Ireland is the [[Higher Education Colleges Association]]. Private colleges in Ireland can seek to have their programmes validated/accredited by the [[Higher Education and Training Awards Council]].

See external links for: ''free-fees initiative''  and  ''Higher Education Colleges Association''.

=== Netherlands ===
[[Nyenrode]] is the only private university in the [[Netherlands]] at the graduate level. The university was founded in 1946. It serves as a [[graduate school]] for business and management. Both programs are taught in English.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Recently, Nyenrode merged with the [[Institute for CPA Education]] and both institutions share their facilities. The Nyenrode Business University also contains a campus and active student body.

Other Dutch private universities are universities of applied science (HBOs) where one can obtain a bachelor's or master's degree but not a PhD. These include [[Wittenborg University]], [[Business School Notenboom]] (founded in 1958)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notenboom.nl/ |title=Particuliere Business school |publisher=Notenboom |accessdate=14 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[IVA Driebergen]] for the automotive industry with its earliest beginnings in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iva-driebergen.nl/index.php?pageID=30&amp;n=47&amp;s=73 |title=Meer dan tachtig jaar; IVA Driebergen |publisher=Iva-driebergen |accessdate=14 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Poland ===
* [[SWPS University of Social Sciences and Humanities]]
* [[John Paul II Catholic University of Lublin]]
There are 321 accredited private colleges in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;„Szkoły wyższe i ich finanse w 2012 r.”, s. 32, 2013-11-13. Główny Urząd Statystyczny. {{ISSN|1506-2163}} (pol.).&lt;/ref&gt; They award bachelor's degrees, master's degrees and doctorate degrees.

=== Portugal ===
{{Main article|Higher education in Portugal}}
The oldest non-state-run university, the ''[[Universidade Católica Portuguesa]]'' – UCP (Catholic University of Portugal), a [[catholic]] private university ([[concordat]]ory status), with branches in the cities of [[Lisbon]], [[Porto]], [[Braga]], [[Viseu]], and [[Caldas da Rainha]], was founded before the others, in 1967, and officially recognized in 1971. UCP offers some well-recognized degrees and is reputed for the economics, law and business management degrees it awards at its Lisbon branch. Other degrees awarded by UCP, like biotechnology and dental medicine, amassed increasing success and popularity since the 2000s.

After the [[Carnation Revolution]] of 1974, in the 1980s and 1990s, a boom of educational private institutions was experienced in Portugal, and many private universities started to open. Most had a poor reputation and were known for making it easy for students to enter and also to get high grades. In 2007, several of those private universities, or their heirs, were investigated and faced compulsory closing (for example, the infamous [[Independente University]] and [[Internacional University]] closings, and the [[Moderna University]] scandal) or official criticism with recommendations that the state-managed investigation proposed for improving their quality and avoid termination.

In the mid-2000s, within the [[Bologna process]], a reorganization of higher education was started which included more stringent regulations for private education and expanded state policies with regard to private education quality assurance and [[educational accreditation]]. In general, the private higher education institutions were often considered the schools of last resort for underachieving applicants who didn't score enough points in the admission examinations to enter the main public institutions.

Nearly open-admission policies have hurt private universities' reputation and the actual quality of their alumni. Without large endowments like those received, for example, by many US private universities and colleges which are attractive to the best scholars, researchers and students, the private [[list of higher education institutions in Portugal|higher education institutions of Portugal]], with a few exceptions, do not have either the financial support or the academic profile to reach the highest teaching and research standards of the top Portuguese [[public universities]]. In addition, most private universities have faced a restrictive lack of collaboration with the major enterprises which, however, have developed fruitful relationships with many public higher education institutions. Most Portuguese private universities specialise in a limited number of fields, most often in the [[social sciences]] and [[humanities]].

=== Serbia ===
{{Main article|List of universities in Serbia}}

There is a number of private universities and independent [[Faculty (division)|faculties]] in Serbia, mostly in [[Belgrade]]. They were founded in the 1990s and 2000s. Some, but not all of them are accredited by the state Commission for Accreditation and Quality Assurance. Serbian private universities and faculties have a general reputation of low-quality institutions where [[nouveau riche]] businesspeople, popular music/TV stars, sportspeople and politicians, as well as their children, [[diploma mill|obtain degrees for money]].

=== Switzerland ===
Further to the public [[Universities in Switzerland]], the country is well known for its high-quality private education system.

=== Turkey ===
In Turkey there are now 66 private universities. Bilkent University, founded in 1984, was the first. Actually they have to be and all belong to NGOs due to the high Education Law, article 3-c and annexed article 2.&lt;ref&gt;Yüksek Öğretim Kanunu/High Education Law&lt;/ref&gt;

In Turkey, according to the laws of private universities, on the recommendation of the Higher Education Council is established by law. The establishment of such universities, established a new university building or in the form of a higher education institution will be the name of the university. Foundations for the establishment of the university, the university faculty, the formation of at least two of the bodies of the faculties of arts and science education programs related to the fields to be present, the university of arts and science programs to be among the first to be launched training programs and eligible to attend the university's commitment to the education of students in these programs start year necessary.

=== United Kingdom ===
{{See also|Universities in the United Kingdom}}

There are five fully private universities in the United Kingdom: the [[University of Buckingham]], [[BPP University]], [[Regent's University London]], the [[University of Law]] and [[Arden University]].&lt;ref name=independent160211&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher/the-university-debate-what-the-ivy-league-can-teach-britain-2215930.html|title=The University Debate: What the Ivy League can teach Britain|accessdate=3 March 2011|publisher=The Independent|date=16 February 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-23605046 | work=BBC News | title=For-profit college gains full university status | date=8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/profit-rdi-granted-university-status|title=For-profit RDI granted university status|newspaper=Times Higher Education|date=5 August 2015|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All other British universities are partly publicly funded and regulated: the government regulates their tuition fees, student funding and student loans and commissions and regulates research assessments and teaching reviews. However, unlike in Continental European countries, the British government does not own universities' assets, and university staff are not civil servants: government regulation arises as a condition of accepting funding from bodies such as [[Higher Education Funding Council for England|HEFCE]] and any university can in principle choose to leave the HEFCE regulated system at any time.&lt;ref name="OXCHEPS39"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://oxcheps.new.ox.ac.uk/MainSite%20pages/Resources/OxCHEPS_OP39.pdf|title = OFFA and £6000-9000 tuition fees| accessdate =20 March 2011|last = Dennis|first=Farrington|author2=David Palfreyman|date =21 February 2011|format=PDF| work = OxCHEPS Occasional Paper No. 39|publisher=Oxford Centre for Higher Education Policy Studies|quote=Note, however, that any university which does not want funding from HEFCE can, as a private corporation, charge whatever tuition fees it likes (exactly as does, say, the University of Buckingham or BPP University College). Under existing legislation and outside of the influence of the HEFCE-funding mechanism upon universities, Government can no more control university tuition fees than it can dictate the price of socks in Marks &amp; Spencer. Universities are not part of the State and they are not part of the public sector; Government has no reserve powers of intervention even in a failing institution. }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since September 2012 government funding for teaching and background funding for research has been substantially reduced, with one study from that year indicating that annual government funding for teaching and research would make up just 15% of universities’ income by 2015.&lt;ref name="PatonJan2012"&gt;{{cite news|first=Graeme|last=Paton|title=Taxpayer funding of universities 'to drop to 100 year low'|date=5 January 2012|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/8992136/Taxpayer-funding-of-universities-to-drop-to-100-year-low.html|work = The Telegraph|accessdate =6 January 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, an institution can only use the title "University" or "University College" if it has been granted by the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]], under the terms of the [[Further and Higher Education Act 1992]].&lt;ref name="privy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.privy-council.org.uk/output/Page27.asp |title=Higher Education |accessdate=6 December 2007|publisher=[[Privy Council Office (United Kingdom)|Privy Council Office]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chile ===
Chile has 31 completely private universities and an additional 14 universities which are run by private organizations (mostly religious) but receive some state funding.&lt;ref name="Chile"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Universidades públicas y privadas: Un enfoque tridimensional |journal=Estudios Públicos |date=Spring 2010 |last=Rigoberto Parada |first=José |volume=120 |pages=183–205 |url=http://www.cepchile.cl/dms/archivo_4745_2877/rev120_JRParada.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2015-10-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923202037/http://www.cepchile.cl/dms/archivo_4745_2877/rev120_JRParada.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Guatemala ===

In Guatemala, the only public university is [[Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala]]. The rest of the degree offering institutions in the country are private. See [[list of universities in Guatemala]] for a list of the private universities in the country.

=== Mexico ===
Mexico has private and public (government managed) universities. Public universities are free or require a very minimum fee and private universities usually charge for an initial enrollment and monthly fees.

=== United States ===
In the US, many universities and colleges are private,{{quantify|date=June 2017}} mostly operating as educational and research [[nonprofit organization]]s,{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} while there are also [[For-profit higher education in the United States|for-profit universities]]. About 20% of American college students attend private colleges.&lt;ref name="WaMo041712"&gt;{{cite news|first=Daniel|last=Luzer|url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/college_guide/blog/can_we_make_college_cheaper.php|title=Can We Make College Cheaper?|work=[[Washington Monthly]]|date=13 April 2012|accessdate=17 April 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416060750/http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/college_guide/blog/can_we_make_college_cheaper.php|archivedate=16 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the remainder attend state-supported schools.

Legally, private universities may not discriminate, but generally have a somewhat free hand in setting admissions policies.{{Weasel inline|date=June 2017}}  Universities base their selections on many secondary factors other than academic performance.&lt;ref name="gladwell"&gt;Gladwell, Malcolm. (2005) "Getting In: the social logic of Ivy League admissions." The New Yorker, 10 October 2005 [http://www.newyorker.com/critics/atlarge/articles/051010crat_atlarge]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tuition fees]] at private universities tend to be higher than at [[public universities]], though many private universities offer financial aid as well.&lt;ref&gt;Tottie, Gunnel. (2001) ''Introduction to American English'' Blackwell Publishing. p. 65. {{ISBN|0-631-19792-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, at Princeton University, 60% of the Class of 2013 received financial aid, with an average grant amount of $36,000. The average grant now exceeds Princeton’s $35,340 annual tuition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.princeton.edu/admission/whatsdistinctive/experience/financial_aid_without_loa/ |title=Princeton University &amp;#124; Financial Aid Without Loans |publisher=Princeton.edu |accessdate=2012-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201180525/http://www.princeton.edu/admission/whatsdistinctive/experience/financial_aid_without_loa/ |archivedate=2012-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7432">'''Rapid learning''' (or Rapid eLearning Development) has traditionally referred to a methodology to build e-learning courses rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;
Karrer, T. (2006). [http://elearningtech.blogspot.com/2006/06/what-is-rapid-elearning_13.htmlWhat is Rapid eLearning?] : eLearning Technology.
&lt;/ref&gt; Typically the author will create slides in PowerPoint, record narration on top of the slides, and then use software to add tests, or even collaboration activities between the slides. The whole package is then sent, most often as an [[Adobe Flash]] file, to a [[learning management system]] or website. 

E-learning has grown rapidly since the 1990s but developers and organizations were confronted by the complexity of authoring processes. The difficulty and expense of building online courses from scratch led to the idea of recycling existing resources like Powerpoint presentations, and transforming them into e-learning courses. A traditional e-learning development project can take several months. In contrast the aim of rapid e-learning is to build and roll out content modules within weeks. For example, while one hour of standard e-learning can take 73&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Defelice | first = Robyn A. | last2 = Kapp | first2 = Karl M. | title = Time to Develop One Hour of Training | publisher = ASTD | url=http://www.astd.org/LC/2009/0809_kapp.htm | accessdate = 23 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to 220&lt;ref name="Chapman"&gt;{{Cite web | last = Chapman | first = Bryan | title = How long does it take to create learning? | url=http://brandon-hall.com/bryanchapman/?p=7 | accessdate = 23 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; hours to develop, a [[Microsoft PowerPoint|PowerPoint]] to e-learning conversion can be estimated to take an average of 33 hours to develop.&lt;ref name="Chapman" /&gt;

The term "rapid learning" is also sometimes used as a synonym for "short-form" or "bite-size" learning. In this usage, it refers not to how rapidly a module can be created by an e-learning developer, but how rapidly it can be viewed by a learner. 
== Software==
Several rapid learning software applications with varying capabilities are on the market. Most of them are authoring tools that include rapid learning as a feature. 

Some of these tools treat each slide as a learning object and allow to add tests and online activities between the slides. Some of these software are online services, the others are desktop applications to install on your computer.

A trend of the market is also to combine rapid learning (conversion of PowerPoint presentations) with [[screencast]] (filming your screen and your mouse movements) so as to provide both a sequence of slides and applications demos. This combination is particularly powerful when authoring courses on how to use a software.
== Best practice ==

Rapid learning development is now an integral part of the authoring practice worldwide. Some authors and consulting companies focus on how to reach the optimal compromise between the economic need for rapid learning and the pedagogical objective of a good instructional design.&lt;ref&gt;
Van Dam, N. (2007). [http://www.learning2007.com/p7/l7_u_01_nick-van-dam.pdf 25 Best Practices in Learning &amp; Talent Development] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170127031201/http://www.learning2007.com/p7/l7_u_01_nick-van-dam.pdf |date=2017-01-27 }}. 
&lt;/ref&gt; Best practice recommendations include:

* proceed to needs analysis and instructional design before building the online course so as to define the required learning activities to integrate in the course
* needs analysis should decide whether the course is a blended learning course or all online
* instructional design should decide which part of the course are online, which parts are face-to-face
* articulate PowerPoint-based content with tests and online activities
* web 2.0 tools and learning management systems allow to blend content modules created through rapid learning tools with rich interaction activities. The content modules make sense only if completing an interaction scenario or appearing as the feedback of tests and case studies
* using PowerPoint to build the course structure but rely on [[mindmapping]] to present the information in a more synthetic and visual way &lt;ref&gt;
De Praetere, T. (2009). [http://www.dokeos.com/en/node/561 From PowerPoint to Mindmaps in e-learning] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102021215/http://dokeos.com/en/node/561 |date=2010-01-02 }}. 
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limits ==

After 2000, a series of rapid learning tools were proposed on the market and became popular because of their simplicity and the feeling that anyone could build an [[e-learning]] course from a simple [[PowerPoint presentation]]. Some experts have highlighted the limits of this method &lt;ref&gt;
Brandon, B. (2005). [http://www.elearningguild.com/pdf/4/rapid_elearning_whitepaper_3-2-05.pdf Exploring the definition of "Rapid eLearning"]. 
&lt;/ref&gt; or even insisted &lt;ref&gt;
Bersin, J. &amp; O'Leonard, K. (2005). [http://www.bersin.com/Lib/Rs/Details.aspx?docid=10335312 Rapid E-Learning: What Works Study]. 
&lt;/ref&gt; on the fact that rapid learning was the consequence of the misapprehension that if a face-to-face course worked well with PowerPoint, it would function equally well online. This criticism of rapid learning development focuses on the idea that the richness of an interaction with students in the [[classroom]] is not encapsulated in a [[PowerPoint]] presentation file. Consequently, an online course is a mere passive information presentation but not a training activity with questions, workshops, problems. Rapid learning has been criticized for ignoring the axiom that people "learn by doing". More globally, the critics of rapid learning have followed the same track as the critics on the use of PowerPoint in education.&lt;ref&gt;
Jones, A. (2003). [https://web.archive.org/web/20080822220748/http://www.bioscience.heacademy.ac.uk/journal/vol2/beej-2-3.aspx The use and abuse of Powerpoint in Teaching and Learning in the Life Sciences:  A Personal Overview].
&lt;/ref&gt; 

The success of rapid learning has an economic reason. Many developers and organizations are able for the first time to build their online course without the help of an e-learning team (including instructional designers, art designers and other contributors). The overall evolution of internet practice and the development of the [[Web 2.0]] collaboration [[scenario]]s might lead trainers to other scenarios. Rapid learning is seen an inheritance of the [[CD-ROM]] model and the idea that e-learning consists in an individual [[Self-paced instruction|self-paced]] practice. 

Students often complain that [[Self-paced instruction|self-paced individual learning]] can be unengaging and offers little chances of interaction, correction and success. This can be overcome through scenarios where the information is presented as rapid learning modules encapsulated in Flash [[SCORM]] packages or distributed on [[Learning Management System]]s, and the learning activities developed through other tools, such as [[blog]]s, [[wiki]]s, forums or videoconferences.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2972">'''Scene study''' is a technique used to teach [[acting]]. One or more [[actor]]s perform a [[drama]]tic [[Scene (fiction)|scene]] and are then offered feedback from teachers, classmates, or each other.

Scene Study is a very broad description for an acting class that will vary depending on the teacher or school that teaches it.  Its foundation is in the performance of a "scene" or a segment of a play by the students.  From this performance the instructor gives notes and suggestions to improve the student’s acting. Scene Study is instrumental for actors to get experience being directed.   For beginning actors the Scene Study class may also include acting exercises that help them develop their technique. In actor Uta Hagen's novel, ''Respect for Acting'' she mentions the three entrances in Part Two, chapter twelve. The moment before is the first entrance, the actor must think of the scene before if it is his or her first time entering. If the actor enters in scene one, then he or she must think of what the character's circumstances before the play would be. These exercises may help with skills such as emotional connection or character development and for the real novice it may be used to teach the vocabulary of acting (for example terms like down stage and subtext). Other acting vocabulary includes objective, tactics, essential action, character, scene, acts, costumes, setting, and literal action. Objective, essential action, and literal action relates to what the character wants, as well as what the character is doing. Tactics are what the character does in order to get what they want. The other terms are design elements or basic elements that one sees on stage. It is the job of the actor to implement all of these terms in order to create a believable moment. However, most Scene Study classes are used for actors who already have their training and technique and now need the opportunity to take their skills and apply them towards performing on stage or on set.  The best Scene Study classes will be able to keep improving an actor’s technique, as well as give them the opportunity to be directed and see if they are able to perform to a director’s specification.  Scene Study is important because it allows an actor to see if all the techniques and exercises they use in class can be harnessed to create an honest and dynamic performance. Scene study is also important because the actor needs to focus on the other actor. Reacting is just as important as acting, if the actor fails to react to their scene partner then the believability diminishes. Scene study gives the actors the opportunity to work together and remember that it is not "all about them."

A '''scholaster''', from the Latin ''scholasticus'' (schoolmaster), or '''magister scholarum''', was the head of an ecclesiastical school, typically a [[cathedral school]], [[monastic school]], or the school of a [[collegiate church]], in medieval and early-modern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Nissen and William den Boer, "The Middle Ages after 1200", in ''Handbook of Dutch Church History'', edited by Herman Selderhuis (Göttingen, 2014), pp. 141-142.&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the size of the school and the status of the institution to which it was attached, they might be the only teacher, the head of a considerable educational establishment, or have oversight over all the schools in their city or territory.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Helen Haggh, ''Music, Liturgy, and Ceremony in Brussels, 1350-1500'', vol. 1 (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1988) , pp. 149-153.&lt;/ref&gt; The scholaster might be a dignitary in a cathedral or collegiate [[chapter (religion)|chapter]], alongside the [[provost (religion)|provost]], [[dean (Christianity)|dean]], [[cantor (Christianity)|cantor]], [[succentor]], [[precentor]], [[archdeacon]], [[church treasure|treasurer]], [[cellarium|cellarer]], [[sacristan]] or [[almoner]].&lt;ref&gt;Anne Walters Robertson, ''Guillaume de Machaut and Reims: Context and Meaning in His Musical Works'' (Cambridge University Press, 2002), pp. 35, 140.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not unknown for a scholaster to take the revenues of the post and deputise somebody else to carry out any teaching work involved.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Nissen and William den Boer, "The Middle Ages after 1200", in ''Handbook of Dutch Church History'', edited by Herman Selderhuis (Göttingen, 2014), pp. 141-142.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Secular education''' is a system of public education in countries with a [[secular]] government or [[separation of church and state|separation]] between [[religion]] and [[Sovereign state|state]].

An example of a secular educational system would be the [[Education in France|French public educational system]], where [[French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools|conspicuous religious symbols]] have been banned in schools. 
While some religious groups are hostile to secularism and see such measures as promoting [[atheism]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.missionislam.com/homed/response.htm The Islamic Response to the Secular Educational System]&lt;/ref&gt; other citizens claim that the display of any religious symbol constitutes an infringement of the [[separation of church and state]] and a discrimination against atheist, agnostic and non-religious people.

==Actions and controversies==
*In [[Turkey]] the promotion of [[İmam Hatip school|Imam Hatip]] Islamic schools by the government&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Turkish-government-promoting-Islamic-schools-at-the-expense-of-secular-education-28824.html Asia News 08/24/2013 Turkish government promoting Islamic schools at the expense of secular education]&lt;/ref&gt; following the March 2012 education reform bill, allegedly alarmed some Turkish citizens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenational.ae/world/europe/rise-of-islamic-schools-causes-alarm-in-secular-turkey The National - Rise of Islamic schools causes alarm in secular Turkey]&lt;/ref&gt; The Education Reform Bill was written without public debate or even discussion in the [[Ministry of National Education (Turkey)|Ministry of National Education]]'s own consultative body; it did not even figure in the government’s 2011 election manifesto. Besides undermining [[Turkish secularism]], the new measures would undermine educational standards and deepen social inequalities, according to education specialists.

'''Shared reading''' is an instructional approach in which the teacher explicitly models the strategies and skills of proficient [[Reading (process)|readers]].

In Brenda Parkes' text, [[Read It Again!]], a guide for teachers to do shared reading in the classroom, the first chapter asks, What is Shared Reading? She then answers the question by writing, " Shared reading is a collaborative learning activity, based on research by Don Holdaway (1979), that emulates and builds from the child's experience with bedtime stories."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Parkes|first1=Brenda|title=Read it Again!: Revisiting Shared Reading|date=2000|publisher=Stenhouse Publishers|isbn=157110304X|page=1 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=Hsrbi5qD4MQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early childhood classrooms, shared reading typically involves a teacher and a large group of children sitting closely together to read and reread carefully selected enlarged texts. Shared reading can also be done effectively with smaller groups.

With this instructional technique, students have an opportunity to gradually assume more responsibility for the reading as their skill level and confidence increase. Shared reading also provides a safe learning environment for students to practice the reading behaviours of proficient readers with the support of teacher and peers. Shared reading may focus on needs indicated in assessment data and required by grade level curriculum expectations. The text is always chosen by the teacher and must be visible to the students.

==Description==

Traditionally, shared reading has used paper-based materials.  However, recently a number of electronic resources have been developed.  One such resource is an online resource called Mimic Books.  This resource has been specifically designed to be used on interactive whiteboards for shared reading lessons. The benefits of this resource is that it replicates the look and appearance of a real big book but on the interactive whiteboard making it clearly visible to children. By increasing the amount of shared-reading in the home, parents are able to help children with their development of a larger knowledge base for understanding the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wolf|first1=M|title=Proust and the squid: The story and science of reading the brain|date=2005|publisher=Harper|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The main purpose of shared reading is to provide children with an enjoyable experience, introduce them to a variety of authors, illustrators and types of texts to entice them to become a reader. The second and equally as important purpose is to teach children the reading process and teach systematically and explicitly how to be readers and writers themselves. (Parkes, 2000).  Through shared reading, children learn to track print and connect print to speech (Clay, 2000). By increasing the amount of shared-reading in the home, parents are able to help children with their development of a larger knowledge base for understanding the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wolf|first1=M|title=Proust and the squid: The story and science of reading the brain|date=2005|publisher=Harper|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specification for texts==
When selecting texts for reading, teachers typically look for text that is appropriate for the [[reading level]] of the students, that is also cross-curricular and relevant in its nature.  The text should be of an appropriate length for study and be adequately complex.  The text should also have an impact.

==Method==
In primary grades, the teacher reads while the children are encouraged to read along. The more familiar the text, the more the teachers asks of the students in terms of reading, talking and answering questions about the reading. In upper grades, the teacher reads the text aloud after stating a focus, and then re-reads the text, asking questions specific to the focus of choice (and may ask students to join). The focus may include things like: analysis, predictions, drawing inferences, [[grammar]] and [[punctuation]], [[vocabulary]] development, questioning, literacy elements, [[critical thinking]], phrasing, fluency, intonation, character and plot Development.

According to Morrow (2009), shared reading usually begins with a teacher reading from a Big Book so that everyone can see the text. Stories that have predictable plots are best because students can participate early on in the shared reading experience.  During the first reading, students should simply listen to the story. The teacher might use a pointer to demonstrate directionality in text and one-to-one correspondence. As the text is read multiple times, students should begin to participate by chanting, making predictions, providing key words that are important in the story or participating in echo reading. Morrow (2009) also suggests to tape-record shared book readings and make it available for students to listen to at another time. "This activity provides a familiar and fluent model for reading with good phrasing and intonation for children to emulate" (Morrow, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;199).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8792">'''Student–teacher ratio''' or '''student–faculty ratio''' is the number of students who attend a [[school]] or [[university]] divided by the number of teachers in the institution. For example, a student–teacher ratio of 10:1 indicates that there are 10 students for every one teacher. The term can also be reversed to create a teacher–student ratio.

The ratio is often used as a proxy for [[class size]], although various factors can lead to class size varying independently of student–teacher ratio (and vice versa).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OBZCxM1-Pg8C&amp;pg=PA46|pages=45–46|title=Does Measurement Measure Up?: How Numbers Reveal and Conceal the Truth|first=John M.|last=Henshaw|isbn=9780801883750|year=2006|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In most cases, the student–teacher ratio will be significantly lower than the average class size.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kZXSTgRueeMC&amp;pg=PA37|page=37|title=Multilevel Modeling of Social Problems: A Causal Perspective|first=Robert B |last=Smith|isbn=9789048198559|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Student–teacher ratios vary widely among developed countries.{{sfn|OECD|2014|p=447}} In [[primary education]], the average student–teacher ratio among members of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] is just below 16, but ranges from 40 in Brazil to 28 in Mexico to 11 in Hungary and Luxembourg.{{sfn|OECD|2014|p=447}}

==Relationship to class size==

Factors that can affect the relationship between student–teacher ratio and class size include the number of teachers with non-teaching duties, the number of classes per teacher, and the number of teachers per class. In addition, if there are small classes for a small number of students, for example for [[special education]] or [[second language]] learners, the student–teacher ratio for the institution will be misleadingly low relative to the average student's experience.{{sfn|Henshaw|2006|p=46}}

An example of this variation is that both Israel and the United States have an average student–faculty ratio of 15, but the average class size is 21 in the United States but 27 in Israel.{{sfn|OECD|2014|p=447}}

== Background ==

A low student–teacher ratio is often used as a [[marketing|selling point]] to those choosing schools for [[tertiary education]]. On the other hand, high student–teacher ratio is often cited for criticizing proportionately underfunded schools or school systems, or as evidence of the need for legislative change or more funding for education.

In the [[United States]], some states have enacted [[legislation]] mandating a maximum student–teacher ratio for specific grade levels, particularly [[kindergarten]]. When such figures are stated for schools, they often represent averages ([[mean]]s) and thus are vulnerable to [[Skewness|skewing]]. For example, figures may be biased as follows: if one classroom has a 30:1 ratio and another has a 10:1 ratio, the school could thus claim to have a 20:1 ratio overall. In schools, such ratios are indicative of possible staff changes. If the student–teacher ratio is 50:1, the school will probably consider hiring a few teachers. If the ratio is very low, classes could be combined and teachers fired. In extreme cases, the school may close, due to its apparent redundancy.

Classes with too many students are often disrupting to education. Also, too many students in a class results in a diverse field of students, with varying degrees of learning ability. Consequently, the class will spend time for less academic students to assimilate the information, when that time could be better spent progressing through the [[curriculum]]. In this way, student–teacher ratios are compelling arguments for advanced or honors classes.

== Arguments ==

Numerous sources argue that lower student–teacher ratios are better at teaching students complex subjects, such as physics, mathematics and chemistry, than those with a higher ratio of students to teachers. Commonly, the schools with lower student–teacher ratios are more exclusive, have a higher attendance of whites and are in non-inner urban areas and/or fee-paying (non-government) institutions.&lt;ref name="Brookings"&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Card |authorlink=David Card |author2=Alan B.

The manifold arguments and controversies of funding and student–teacher ratios have been the basis for a multitude of studies and debates. One view is illustrated below:
{{quotation|Many analysts have found that extra school resources play a negligible role in improving student achievement while children are in school. Yet many economists have gathered data showing that students who attend well-endowed schools grow up to enjoy better job market success than children whose education takes place in schools where resources are limited. For example, children who attend schools with a lower pupil–teacher ratio and a better educated teaching staff appear to earn higher wages as adults than children who attend poorer schools.&lt;ref name="Brookings" /&gt;}}

Smaller classes are widely believed to benefit all pupils because of individual attention from teachers, and low-attaining pupils are seen to benefit more at the [[secondary school]] level, where the content level is more challenging. Pupils in large classes drift off task because of too much instruction from the teacher to the whole class instead of individual attention, and low-attaining students are most affected.&lt;ref name="Blachford 2011"&gt;{{Cite journal | first = Peter | last = Blatchford | first2 = Paul | last2 = Bassett | first3 = Penelope | last3 = Brown | year = 2011 | title = Examining the effect of class size on classroom engagement and teacher—pupil interaction: Differences in relation to pupil prior attainment and primary vs. secondary schools | journal = Learning and Instruction | volume = 21 | pages = 715–30 | doi = 10.1016/j.learninstruc.2011.04.001 | url = http://www.classsizematters.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Examining-the-effect-of-class-size-on-classroom-engagement-and-Teacher-pupil-interaction-Differences-in-relation-to-pupil-prior-attainment-and-primary-vs.-secondary-schools.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Students benefit in later grades from being in small classes during early grades. Longer periods in small classes resulted in more increases in achievement in later grades for all students. In reading and science, low achievers benefit more from being in small classes. The benefits of small class sizes reduce the student achievement gap in reading and science in later grades.&lt;ref name="Konstantopoulos 2009"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Konstantopoulos | first = Spyros | last2 = Chung | first2 = Vicki | year = 2009 | title = What Are the Long-Term Effects of Small Classes on the Achievement Gap?

A '''talibé''' (also called ''talibe'', plural ''talibés'', Arabic, {{lang|ar|طالب }} ṭālib, "''student''", lit. "''seeker''"; pl. {{lang|ar|طلاب}} ''ṭullāb'') is a boy, usually from [[Senegal]], [[the Gambia]], [[Guinea]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Mali]] or [[Mauritania]], who studies the [[Quran]] at a daara (West African equivalent of [[madrasa]]). This education is guided by a teacher known as a [[marabout]].  In most cases talibés leave their parents to stay in the daara.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch, ''Off the Backs of the Children: Forced Begging and Other Abuses against Talibés in Senegal'' (2010), https://www.hrw.org, p 4, 17, 21; Donna L. Perry “Muslim Child Disciples, Global Civil Society, and Children's Rights in Senegal: The Discourses of Strategic Structuralism” (2004) 77:1 ''Anthropological Quarterly'' 47 at 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Senegal, the term ‘talibé’ can be used in a wider context, “for instance to denote a militant adherent of a political party.”&lt;ref&gt;Ed van Hoven “The Nation Turbaned? The Construction of Nationalist Muslim Identities in Senegal” (2000) 3 ''Journal of Religion in Africa'' 225 at 245 (footnote 26).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Vélingara-Talibés.jpg|thumb|right|Two talibés boys in [[Vélingara]], Senegal.]]
The talibé’s relationship with his marabout is one of “devotion and strict obedience.” The marabout provides “guidance, protection, and intercession” for the talibé. A talibé’s allegiance to his marabout is expressed through economic support or tithes.&lt;ref&gt;Codou Bop “Roles and the Position of Women in Sufi Brotherhoods in Senegal” (2005) 73:4 ''Journal of the American Academy of Religion'' 1099 at 1104.&lt;/ref&gt;

The views on talibés in Senegalese society are diverse.&lt;ref&gt;Donna L. Perry “Muslim Child Disciples, Global Civil Society, and Children's Rights in Senegal: The Discourses of Strategic Structuralism” (2004) 77:1 ''Anthropological Quarterly'' 47 at 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Some individuals, ethnic groups and religious denominations promote the raising of talibés while others reject the practice. Among those who support it there is a range of views of the best way to manage a daara.&lt;ref&gt;Perry at 55.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Many theories exist to explain the motivations of parents to send their children to a daara. These include; de facto fostering because of financial difficulties; securing a better future for the child by building a relationship with the Muslim brotherhood to which the marabout belongs, and; preparing the child for a career as a marabout.&lt;ref&gt;Perry at 58-59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anti-Slavery International ''Begging for Change: Research findings and recommendations on forced child begging in Albania/Greece, India and Senegal'' (2009) http://www.antislavery.org/, p 14.&lt;/ref&gt;  Donna L. Perry disagrees with those who portray parents of talibés as “ignorant traditionalists or economic victims,” and marabouts as being “warped by the stresses of modernity.”&lt;ref&gt;Perry at 72-73.&lt;/ref&gt;  Based on interviews with [[Wolof people|Wolof]] farmers, she contends that the popularity of raising talibés remains essentially linked to [[West Africa]]n values on child-rearing, rather than a response to “rampant population growth, intensified poverty, and neoliberal policy.”&lt;ref&gt;Perry at 74.&lt;/ref&gt; The framing of the plight of talibés in socio-economic terms is, according to Perry, an intentional strategy of [[NGO]]s to “avoid accusations of cultural imperialism.”&lt;ref&gt;Perry at 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[Daara|Daaras]] have existed for hundreds of years. They grew in significance during the [[French West Africa|French colonial period]].&lt;ref&gt;Perry at 56.&lt;/ref&gt;  The number of rural daaras declined during the latter half of the 20th century in favour of Arab-styled medersas (madrasa). Medersas grew in popularity as they enabled farmers to keep their children working outside of school hours, provided a secular and Quaranic education, and exposed children to fewer hardships.  During this time many daaras moved to the cities.&lt;ref&gt;Perry at 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, [[UNICEF]] launched a five-year operation to raise awareness about talibés, and sought to work alongside marabouts to improve talibes’ living conditions. In 1997, this work was picked up on an ad hoc basis by NGOs. These agencies sought to avoid the shortcomings of UNICEF’s model which supplied marabouts with resources which were not always used for the benefit of talibés. Instead, these humanitarian groups worked directly with talibés.&lt;ref&gt;Perry at 66-71.&lt;/ref&gt;  Talibés continue to be a topic of discourse in Senegalese society.&lt;ref&gt;Perry at 74-75.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abuse of Talibés==

===Origins===

Begging used to be characterised by the talibé asking for food to supplement the daara’s supplies when it could not sustain its own demands from the harvests provided by the marabout's fields.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch, p 18, 21.&lt;/ref&gt;  The increasing number of daaras in urban settings has stemmed the traditional forms of support that sustained [[Daara|daaras]]. The prevalence of almsgiving in Senegalese society has made child begging profitable in cities.&lt;ref&gt;Anti-Slavery International, p 14.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, some urban daaras ran seasonally, allowing for marabouts to return to their villages for the harvest. However, it became more economically viable for urban daaras to remain open all year round:

{{quote|''Over time, the marabouts started to stay in the cities…Why return to the village, where they had to work the land for long hours, when [in the city] a child comes daily with money, sugar, and rice?''&lt;ref&gt;Mamadou Ndiaye ''L’Enseignement arabo-islamique au Sénégal'' (Centre de Recherches sur L’histoire d’art et la Culture Islamiques, Istanbul, 1985), 270.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Perry warns that the above view can imply that only urban daaras exploit talibés. She contends that urban and rural [[daaras]] “are the same. There is just one difference: the urban talibe’s ‘farm’ is the urban street, and [the] ‘crop’ he harvests is cash, and not peanuts.”&lt;ref&gt;Parry at 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of marabouts taking on talibés is seldom subject to state regulation, making it easier for abuse of this relationship to occur.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch, p 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Senegalese government has recently created state-regulated daaras in order to reduce abuses. However, urban daaras with resident talibés form the most common form of Quranic schools.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch, p 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nature of the abuse===
Some marabouts, instead of teaching their talibés about the Quran, exploit them for labour, typically through forced begging on the streets. The nature of this exploitation exposes such talibés to disease, injury, death, physical abuse and sexual abuse.

====Forced labour====
[[File:Talibé (5945897698).jpg|thumb|right|A begging talibé]]
Recent studies show that talibés average just less than 8 hours per day, every day, begging.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch, p 3, 31.&lt;/ref&gt; The exact sums that a talibé must yield each day vary between daaras. A survey of 175 talibes revealed that the average sum demanded by a marabout is 373 CFA ($0.79 USD), rising to 445 CFA ($0.94 USD) on holy days when greater almsgiving is customary.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch, p 31; Exchange rate: $1 USD= $473 CFA on 5 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; [[World Bank]] statistics show that just under 30 percent of Senegal’s population lives on less than 593 CFA ($1.25 USD) per day, and over 55 percent live on less than 949 CFA ($2.00 USD).&lt;ref&gt;''The World Bank'' “Poverty headcount ratio” http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.2DAY/countries/SN?display=graph accessed 24/04/2014
Exchange rate: $1 USD = $473 CFA on 5 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; This highlights the difficulty talibés have in meeting the quotas requested by marabouts. In addition to financial quotas, some marabouts set quotas for basic foodstuffs such as sugar and rice.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch, p 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Physical abuse====
Talibés are sometime required by their marabouts to meet a quota of money or basic foods. Failure to meet that quota can result in physical abuse. [[Human Rights Watch]] (HRW) documented boys exhibiting scars and welts, usually resulting from the application of electric cables, clubs and canes.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch, p 3, 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some daaras, an older, senior talibé, or assistant marabout will be responsible for punishing younger talibés who fail to return their daily quota, or are late returning. In other cases, a marabout might not supervise the children living in the daara, leaving the senior talibés to steal from the younger, as well as abuse them physically and sexually.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch, p 40-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Inadequate care====
Talibés are seldom provided with necessities such as basic shelter and food.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch, p 3, 47-49.&lt;/ref&gt; Some are punished for failing to meeting their quotas by being refused entry into the daara. This forces the child to sustain even longer hours begging, or to sleep on the streets.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch, p 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of talibés are estimated to flee abusive marabouts every year, compounding the issue of [[street children]] in urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch, p 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The fear of punishments for not meeting the marabouts demands also increases instances of thefts by talibés.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch, p 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Living conditions in urban daaras are often characterised by malnourishment, lack of clothing and footwear, exposure to illnesses, and poor medical treatment. In many cases, talibés are still required to beg while ill and to pay for their own treatment. Urban daaras are often sites of overcrowding and poor sanitation, and many lack running water. The poor structures which are sometimes converted into daaras leave the resident boys exposed to the elements.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch, p 42-44.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sexual abuse====
Little research has been done on the extent of sexual abuse of talibés. HRW, however, noted several of instances of rape in daaras by older talibés, or assistant marabouts. Other instances of rape were reported to have taken place outside of the daara against children living on the street who had fled from violence at their daara.  These cases were recorded in interviews with talibés who witnessed the abuse, or with social workers assisting the victims.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch, p 53-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Extent of abuses====
A 2007 UNICEF study of child begging in [[Dakar]], the capital of Senegal, found that “the large majority of child beggars (90%) are talibés.”&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF ''Enfants Mendiants dans la Région de Dakar'' (2007) at 7, accessed 5 May 2014 at http://www.unicef.org/socialpolicy/files/2008_Senegal_Enfants_Mendiants_Dakar.pdf (Translation from the original French: « La grande majorité des enfants mendiants (90 %) sont des talibés »).&lt;/ref&gt; UNICEF has estimated there to be between 50,000-100,000 begging talibés in Senegal.&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF at 35.&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2010 report suggests that the number of talibés is on the rise.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch, p 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other researchers, however, warn that “estimates on the numbers of street children rest upon largely elastic and nebulous definitions.”&lt;ref&gt;Perry at 62.&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, there are no official statistics to substantiate these claims. Others respond that the rise of Arabic-maderas is causing the number of talibés to decline.&lt;ref&gt;Perry at 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

HRW has warned that the social status enjoyed by marabouts has emboldened “those responsible for the proliferation of forced child begging and other abuses committed by the marabouts against talibé children.”&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch, p 17.&lt;/ref&gt;  Perry cautiously agrees that “reverence of marabouts and respect for the talibé institution may be a dominant ideology, but it is not now, nor ever was, totalising or uncontested.”&lt;ref&gt;Perry at 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human Rights Issues===
A variety of views exist about how the treatment of talibés engages international conventions.

====Slavery====
Some NGOs argue that, where a marabout acquires custody over a talibé in order to force the child to beg, this meets the definition of a practice ‘akin to [[slavery]]’, as defined by the [[Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery]].&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch, p 94; Anti-Slavery International, p 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  That convention states that receiving a child “with a view to the exploitation of the child or young person or of his labour,” is a practice akin to slavery which is subject to the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations “Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery,” adopted September 7, 1956, 226 ''United Nations Treaty Series'' 3, entered into force April 30, 1957, acceded to by Senegal July 19, 1979, art. 1(d).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Forced Labour====
The [[Forced Labour Convention|Convention concerning Forced or Compulsory Labour]] describes forced labour as work “which is exacted from any person under the menace of any penalty and for which the said person has not offered himself voluntarily.”&lt;ref&gt;United Nations "Convention concerning Forced or Compulsory Labour" (ILO No. 29), 39 ''United Nations Treaty Series'' 55, entered into force May 1, 1932.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Convention goes on to impose a duty on signatory states to “completely suppress such forced or compulsory labour.”&lt;ref&gt;"Convention concerning Forced or Compulsory Labour" , art 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) has opined that the practice of exploiting talibés for labour also falls within the ambit of the [[Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention|Convention on the Worst Forms of Child Labour]].&lt;ref&gt;Convention Concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour (ILO No. 182), 2133 United Nations Treaty Series 161, entered into force 19 November 2000, arts 1(a), (d); International Labour Organization Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, Individual Observation concerning Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, International Labour Conference 102/III(1A) (No. 182), “Senegal,” 2013, p 390, accessed 5 May 2014 at http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_norm/---relconf/documents/meetingdocument/wcms_205472.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is because, its opinion, forced begging is akin to slavery, and because the labour exposes children to a plethora of dangers to their wellbeing.

====Trafficking====
Given the ILO’s views on forced begging, HRW has argued that marabouts, when transporting talibés with the primary intention of obtaining labour from them, are engaging in [[trafficking of children|child trafficking]].&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch, p 97.&lt;/ref&gt; Article 3(c) of the Trafficking in Persons Protocol includes in the definition of ‘trafficking in persons,’ the “recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of a child for the purpose of exploitation.”&lt;ref&gt;United Nations ''Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, Supplementing the United Nations Convention on Transnational Organized Crime (Trafficking Protocol)'', adopted November 15,entered into force December 25, 2003, art 3(c).&lt;/ref&gt;


==== Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) ====

The CRC creates rights to adequate living standards for children, with regard to the means of the primary caregivers, as well as the means of the state to support the primary caregivers.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations “Convention on the Rights of the Child,” 1577 ''United Nations Treaty Series'' 3; 28 ''International Legal Materials'' 1456 (1989), adopted 20 November 1989, entered into force 2 September 1990, ratified by Senegal July 31, 1990, arts 24, 27.&lt;/ref&gt; HRW argues that states, parents and marabouts are in breach of CRC in failing to oversee the adequate housing, care and nourishment of talibés.

HRW also cites the following as other abuses of talibés which breach CRC.
* Forced begging;&lt;ref&gt;“Convention on the Rights of the Child,” arts 6, 18, 19.&lt;/ref&gt; HRW argues that this exposes talibés to considerable dangers. HRW documented cases of talibés dying in car accidents while trying to beg on the streets. The exposure to dangerous work, HRW argues, not only threatens the physical and mental security of talibés, but their lives.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch, p 32-33.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Corporal punishment]]; physical punishments in schools has been described by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, as a type of violence which CRC seeks to stop.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child, “General Comment No. 8: The Right of the Child to Protection from Corporal Punishment and Other Cruel or Degrading Forms of Punishment (arts. 19; 28, para. 2; and 37, inter alia),” UN Doc. CRC/C/GC/8 (2007), accessed 5 May 2014 at http://www.refworld.org/docid/460bc7772.html.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Education; HRW argues that, where a child’s education is almost entirely neglected due to copious hours of begging, this may amount to a breach of CRC.&lt;ref&gt;“Convention on the Rights of the Child,” art 28.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sexual abuse; CRC requires states to take steps to protect children from sexual abuse.&lt;ref&gt;“Convention on the Rights of the Child,” arts 19, 34.&lt;/ref&gt;  
* Leisure; where a marabout denies talibés leisure time, this may breach the child’s right “to rest and leisure.”&lt;ref&gt;“Convention on the Rights of the Child,” art 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

====[[Torture]]====
The [[United Nations Convention against Torture|Convention against Torture]] only applies where the actions are carried out by a state official. However, the committee which oversees that treaty issued an opinion stating that:

{{quote|''[Where] State authorities…know or have reasonable grounds to believe that acts of torture or ill-treatment are being committed by…private actors and they fail to exercise due diligence to prevent, investigate, prosecute and punish such…private actors consistently with the Convention, the State bears responsibility and its officials should be considered as authors, complicit or otherwise responsible under the Convention for consenting to or acquiescing in such impermissible acts.''&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Committee against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, “General Comment No. 2, Implementation of Article 2 by States Parties,” UN Doc. CAT/C/GC/2 (2008), para. 18, accessed 5 May 2014 at http://www.refworld.org/pdfid/47ac78ce2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Given the punishments used against talibés, such as stress positions and chaining, HRW argues that this construction of the Convention indicates that instances of torture are occurring against talibés.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch, p 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been reported by the Senegalese non-governmental organisation [https://web.archive.org/web/20160225120320/http://www.ngo-xalaat.com/ XALAAT], a leading institution that works to confront the issue in this country, that while the subject being very controversial, in some communities there are conclusive evidences that ill-treatment has always been very common practice in most of the traditional Koranic Schools called [[Daara]]. Additionally, this ngo is arguing to have efficiently brought practitioners in this field to connect together the different clusters that have until now ignored while considering the problem. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ngo-xalaat.com|title = Real Development Policies in West Africa|date = |access-date = 19 February 2016|website = XALAAT|publisher = Institute XALAAT|last = |first = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160225120320/http://www.ngo-xalaat.com/|archivedate = 25 February 2016|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Telepresence technology''' is a term used by the  [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) to refer to  the combination of satellite technology  with the Internet to broadcast information, including video in real-time from cameras used on its remotely operated vehicle (ROV) on  ''[[Okeanos Explorer]]''. Its ROV will be operating working in a deep sea environment. Data from the ROV is transmitted to a hub based on the land, which then send it to scientists and to the public.&lt;ref&gt;

A '''tutor''' is a person who provides assistance or tutelage to one or more people on certain subject areas or skills. The tutor spends a few hours on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis to transfer their expertise on the topic or skill to the student. Tutoring can take place in different settings, such as a classroom, a formal tutoring center, or the home of the tutor/learner. As a teaching-learning method, tutoring is characterized by how it differs from formal teaching methods on the basis of the (in)formality of the setting as well as the flexibility in pedagogical methods in terms of duration, pace of teaching, evaluation and tutor-tutee rapport.

==History==
Tutoring began as an informal and unstructured method of educational assistance, dating back to periods in Ancient Greece. Tutors operated on an ad-hoc or impromptu basis in varied and unfixed settings wherein the main goal of the tutor was to impart knowledge to the learner in order to help the latter gain proficiency in the subject area. Methods of tutoring only began to become more structured after the 20th century through focus and specialisation in the training of tutors, application of tutoring, and evaluation of tutors.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, Ralph III, Michele M. Nobel, Terri Hessler, Christopher D. Yawn, and Timothy E. Heron. “Tutoring System Innovations: Past Practice to Future Prototypes.” ''Intervention in School &amp; Clinic'' 43, no. 2 (November 2007): 71–81. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1177/10534512070430020701&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; From the 20th century onwards, with the rapid spread of mainstream education, the demand for tutoring has also increased as a way to supplement formal education.

==British and Irish secondary schools==

{{see also|Teaching assistant (United Kingdom)}}

In [[Great Britain|British]] and [[Ireland|Irish]] [[secondary school]]s, ''form tutors'' are given the responsibilities of a [[form (education)|form]] or [[class (education)|class]] of [[student]]s in a particular year group (up to 30 students). They usually work in year teams headed by a year leader, year head, or guidance teacher.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Form tutors will provide parents with most of the information about their child's progress and any problems they might be experiencing. Ordinarily, the form tutor is the person who contacts a parent if there is a problem at school; however, the year leader or guidance teacher may contact the parents, since the form tutor has full-time responsibility as a specialist subject teacher.

==Private tutoring in Asia==

A 2012 study by the [[Asian Development Bank]] and the Comparative Education Research Centre at the [[University of Hong Kong]] pointed out that private tutoring can dominate the lives of young people and their families, maintain and exacerbate social inequalities, divert needed household income into an unregulated industry, and create inefficiencies in education systems. It can also undermine official statements about fee-free education and create threats to social cohesion.&lt;ref name="adb"&gt;[http://www.adb.org/news/adb-study-highlights-dark-side-shadow-education ADB Study Highlights Dark Side of 'Shadow Education'], Shadow Education: Private Supplementary Tutoring and its Implications for Policy Makers in Asia.&lt;/ref&gt;

In South Korea, nearly 90% of elementary students receive some sort of shadow education.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, Kyung-Keun. 2010. "Educational Equality", in Lee, Chong Jae; Kim, Seong-yul &amp; Adams, Don (eds.), Sixty Years of Korean Education. Seoul: Seoul National University Press, p.302.&lt;/ref&gt; In Hong Kong, about 85% of senior secondary students do so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://klncc.caritas.org.hk/private/document/644.pdf], Caritas, Community &amp; Higher Education Service. 2010. Private Supplementary Tutoring of Secondary Students: Investigation Report. Hong Kong: Caritas.&lt;/ref&gt; 60% of primary students in West Bengal, India,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pratham.org/aser08/ASER_2010_Report.pdf.], Pratham. 2011. Annual Status of Education Report 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and 60% of secondary students in Kazakhstan receive private tutoring.&lt;ref&gt;Kalikova, Saule &amp; Zhanar Rakhimzhanova. 2009. "Private Tutoring in Kazakhstan", in Silova, Iveta (Ed.), Private Supplementary Tutoring in Central Asia: New Opportunities and Burdens.&lt;/ref&gt;

Demand for tutoring in Asia is exploding; by comparison globally, shadow education is most extensive in Asia. This is partly due to the stratification of education systems, cultural factors, perceptions of shortcomings in regular school systems, and the combination of growing wealth and smaller family sizes.&lt;ref name="adb" /&gt; Therefore, the education sector has become a profitable industry which businesses have created different kinds of products and advertisement such us "the king/queen of tutorial", a usual advertisement tactic of Hong Kong tutorial centers that has spread to South Korea, Thailand, Sri Lanka and India where tutors achieve "celebrity-like status".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sharma|first1=Yojana|title=Meet the 'tutor kings and queens'|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-20085558|accessdate=14 June 2016|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, successful Southeast Asian tutors will even embrace the title of "tutor". Online private tutor matching platform and online learning platform offering online learning materials are other creations.

In Cambodia, most tutoring is provided by teachers,&lt;ref name="DawsonWalter"&gt;Dawson, Walter. 2010. "Private Tutoring and Mass Schooling in East Asia: Reflections of Inequality in Japan, South Korea, and Cambodia." Asia Pacific Education Review 11(1):14-24.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in Hong Kong, it is provided by individuals, small companies or large companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iias.nl/article/facing-shadow-education-system-hong-kong], Kwo, Ora &amp; Mark Bray. 2011. "Facing the Shadow Education System in Hong Kong." IIAS Newsletter (University of Leiden, International Institute for Asian Studies)&lt;/ref&gt; In Mongolia, most tutoring is labor-intensive,&lt;ref&gt;Dong, Alison, Batjargal Ayush, Bolormaa Tsetsgee, &amp; Tumendelger Sengedorj. 2006. "Mongolia". In Iveta Silova, Virginija Būdienė, &amp; Mark Bray (Eds.), Education in a Hidden Marketplace: Monitoring of Private Tutoring. New York: Open Society Institute, pp.257-277&lt;/ref&gt; while entrepreneurs in South Korea make use of computers and other forms of technology.&lt;ref name="adb" /&gt;

===Policy===

A 2012 study by the [[Asian Development Bank]] and the Comparative Education Research Centre at the University of Hong Kong recommended policymakers across the region take a closer look at how ‘shadow education’ affects family budgets, children's time, and national education systems. It suggested that in order to reduce the need for private lessons, improvements in mainstream schools should be made. Regulations are also needed to protect consumers.&lt;ref name="adb" /&gt;

==Costs of tutoring==

Some studies have estimated costs associated with "shadow education". In [[Pakistan]], expenditures on tutoring per child averaged $3.40 a month in 2011. In [[India]], average spending was lower, but still equated to about $2 per month.&lt;ref&gt;Aslam, Monazza &amp; Paul Atherton. 2011. "The "Shadow" Education Sector in India and Pakistan: The Determinants, Benefits and Equity Effects of Private Tutoring." Presentation at the UKFIET (United Kingdom Forum for International Education and Training) Conference, University of Oxford, 13–15 September.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Georgia, household expenditures for private tutoring at the secondary school level was $48 million in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;EPPM (International Institute of Education Policy, Planning &amp; Management). 2011. Study of Private Tutoring in Georgia. Tbilisi: EPPM, p.29. (In Georgian)&lt;/ref&gt;  In Hong Kong, the business of providing private tutoring to secondary schools reached $255 million in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Synovate Limited. 2011. Marketing survey of tutoring businesses in Hong Kong, cited in Modern Education Group Limited (2011), Global Offering (for stock market launch), Hong Kong, p.96.&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, a 2008 survey estimated the size of the private tutoring sector to be $6.4 billion.&lt;ref&gt;Vora, Nikhil &amp; Shweta Dewan. 2009. Indian Education Sector: Long Way from Graduation!. Mumbai: IDFC-SSK Securities Ltd., p.60.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Japan]], families spent $12 billion in 2010 on private tutoring.&lt;ref name="DawsonWalter" /&gt;

In the Republic of Korea, where the government has attempted to cool down the private tutoring market, shadow education costs have continually grown, reaching a staggering $17.3 billion in 2010. Household expenditures on private tutoring are equivalent to about 80% of government expenditures on public education for primary and secondary students.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, Sunwoong &amp; Ju-Ho Lee. 2010. "Private Tutoring and Demand for Education in South Korea." Economic Development and Cultural Change 58(2), p.261.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the tutoring market is fragmented. Some online tutoring marketplaces, however, have managed to aggregate a large number of private tutors on their platform and also tutoring data. For example, one such site has over 34,000 registered tutors in California and made public their tutoring hourly rate data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tutoring Rates in California: An Analysis of over 34,000 Private Tutors|url=http://www.findtutorsnearme.com/tutoring-rates-in-california-an-analysis-of-over-34000-private-tutors/|publisher=www.findtutorsnearme.com|accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effectiveness==

In many countries, individuals can become tutors without training. In some countries, including Cambodia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Lao PDR, and Tajikistan, the pattern of classroom teachers supplementing their incomes by tutoring students after school hours is more a necessity than a choice, as many teachers’ salaries hover close to the poverty line.&lt;ref name="adb" /&gt;

In the Republic of Korea, the number of private tutors expanded roughly 7.1% annually on average from 2001 to 2006, and by 2009 the sector was the largest employer of graduates from the humanities and social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, Kyung-Min &amp; Daekwon Park. 2012. "Impacts of Urban Economic Factors on Private Tutoring Industry." Asia Pacific Education Review 13 (20), p.273.&lt;/ref&gt;

Private tutoring is not always effective in raising academic achievement; and in some schools students commonly skip classes or sleep through lessons because they are tired after excessive external study. This means that the shadow system can make regular schooling less efficient.&lt;ref name="adb" /&gt;

Teachers who spend more time focusing on private lessons than regular classes can cause greater inefficiencies in the mainstream school system. Situations in which teachers provide extra private lessons for pupils for whom they are already responsible in the public system can lead to corruption, particularly when teachers deliberately teach less in their regular classes in order to promote the market for private lessons.&lt;ref&gt;Dawson, Walter. 2009. "The Tricks of the Teacher: Shadow Education and Corruption in Cambodia", in Heyneman, Stephen P. (ed.), Buying Your Way into Heaven: Education and Corruption in International Perspective. Rotterdam: Sense Publishers, pp.51-74; Bray &amp; Lykins (2012), p.43.&lt;/ref&gt;

When private tutoring is provided by well trained tutor however the effects can be dramatic, with pupils improving performance by two standard deviations.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, B. (1984). [http://web.mit.edu/bosworth/MacData/afs.course/5/5.95/readings/bloom-two-sigma.pdf "The 2 Sigma Problem: The Search for Methods of Group Instruction as Effective as One-to-One Tutoring"], Educational Researcher, 13:6(4-16).
&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Bloom's 2 Sigma Problem]].

==Types of tutoring==

There can be an existing overlap between different types of tutoring with respect to the setting or location of tutoring, the size of tutor-learner pairings/groups, and the method of tutoring provided, for example, one-on-one peer tutoring can take place through online tutoring. Tutoring is typically private since it is exists independent of the system of public and private education, that is, one can be enrolled in public/private schooling and attend private tutoring services.

=== Academic coaching ===
Academic coaching is a type of mentoring applied to academics.  Coaching involves a collaborative approach. Coaches try to help students learn how they best learn and how to operate in an academic environment. Tutors help students learn the material in individual courses while coaches help students learn how to be successful in school. In college, that includes such topics as: [[study skills]], time management, stress management, effective reading, note-taking, test-taking, and understanding how to use a syllabus. Academic coaches meet with the student regularly throughout the semester. Coaches work with students in all kinds of situations, not just those who are struggling academically.  Academic coaching is also serves to help students prepare for entrance exams to gain entry to schools or universities, and it is a particularly popular in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/06/world/asia/06iht-educlede06.html|title=Tutoring Spreads Beyond Asia's Wealthy|last=Gooch|first=Liz|date=2012-08-05|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-28|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in India, a majority of students, be it of any class or stream, visit a coaching center or a "study circle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/143827.cms|title=Hey tutors! Leave us kids alone|work=The Times Of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home-based tutoring===
{{Main|In-home tutoring}}
[[In-home tutoring]] is a form of tutoring that occurs in the home. Most often the tutoring relates to an academic subject or test preparation. This is in contrast to tutoring centers or tutoring provided through after-school programs. The service most often involves one-on-one attention provided to the pupil. Due to the informal and private nature of in-home tutoring, there is limited substantial or conclusive information on in-home tutoring.

===Online tutoring===
{{Main|Online tutoring}}[[Online tutoring]] is another way for a student to receive academic help, either scheduled or on-demand. Sessions are done through an application where a student and tutor can communicate. Common tools include chat, whiteboard, web conferencing, teleconferencing, online videos and other specialized applets which make it easier to convey information back and forth. Online tutoring has relatively recently emerged as a mechanism to provide tutoring services in contrast to more traditional in-person teaching. One of the potential drawbacks of online tutoring stems from the influx or sensory overload of information from different materials. "For example, mate- rial presented in multiple modalities run the risk of interrupting the learner from a coherent learn- ing experience, of imposing a “split attention” effect (the mind cannot concentrate on two things simultaneously), or of overloading the learner's limited supply of cognitive resources."&lt;ref&gt;Sweller, John, and Paul Chandler. “Why Some Material Is Difficult to Learn.” ''Faculty of Education - Papers (Archive)'', January 1, 1994, 185–233. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1207/s1532690xci1203_1&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Peer tutoring ===
&lt;p&gt;Peer tutoring refers to the method of tutoring that involves members of the same peer group teaching or tutoring one another. The characteristics of a peer tutoring group/pairing vary across age, socioeconomic class, gender, ethnicity. It has been defined as "a class of practices and strategies that employs peers as one-on-one teachers to provide individualized instruction, practice, repetition, and clarification of concepts"&lt;ref&gt;Utley, C., Mortweet, S., &amp; Greenwood, C. (1997). Peer-mediated instruction and interventions. ''Focus on Exceptional Children'', ''29''(5), 1–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==

=== Academic performance ===
Studies have found that peer tutoring provides academic benefits for learners across the subject areas of "reading, mathematics, science, and social studies"&lt;ref&gt;Alzahrani, Turkey, and Melinda Leko. 2018. “The Effects of Peer Tutoring on the Reading Comprehension Performance of Secondary Students With Disabilities: A Systematic Review.” ''Reading &amp; Writing Quarterly'' 34 (1): 1–17. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1080/10573569.2017.1302372&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Peer tutoring has also been found to be an effective teaching method in enhancing the reading comprehension skills of students, especially that of students with a low academic performance at the secondary level in schools. Additionally, peer tutoring has been proven especially useful for those with learning disabilities at the elementary level, while there is mixed evidence showing the effectiveness of peer tutoring for those at the secondary level.&lt;ref&gt;Alzahrani, Turkey, and Melinda Leko. “The Effects of Peer Tutoring on the Reading Comprehension Performance of Secondary Students With Disabilities: A Systematic Review.” ''Reading &amp; Writing Quarterly'' 34, no. 1 (January 2, 2018): 1–17. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1080/10573569.2017.1302372&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic effects ===
Although certain types of tutoring arrangements can require a salary for the tutor, typically tutoring is free of cost and thus financially affordable for learners. The cost-effectiveness of tutoring can prove to be especially beneficial for learners from low-income backgrounds or resource-strapped regions.&lt;ref&gt;Song, Yang, George Loewenstein, and Yaojiang Shi. “Heterogeneous Effects of Peer Tutoring: Evidence from Rural Chinese Middle Schools.” Research in Economics 72 (March 1, 2018): 33–48. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rie.2017.05.002&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, paid tutoring arrangements can create or further highlight socioeconomic disparities between low-income, middle-income and high-income populations. A study found that access to private tutoring was less financially affordable for low-income families, who thus benefited less from private tutoring as compared to high-income populations, who had the resources to profit from private tutoring.&lt;ref&gt;Chu, Hsiao-Lei. “Private Tutoring, Wealth Constraint and Higher Education.” ''Pacific Economic Review'' 20, no. 4 (October 2015): 608–34. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1111/1468-0106.12122&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==

=== Tutoring as "Shadow Education" ===
Tutoring has also emerged as a supplement to public and private schooling in many countries. The supplementary nature of tutoring is a feature in the domain of what some scholars have termed "shadow education".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Bray, Mark. “Shadow Education: Comparative Perspectives on the Expansion and Implications of Private Supplementary Tutoring.” ''Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences'' 77 (April 2013): 412–20. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sbspro.2013.03.096&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Shadow education has been defined as "a set of educational activities that occur out side formal schooling and are designed to enhance the student's formal school career."&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, David Lee, and David P. Baker. “Shadow Education and Allocation in Formal Schooling: Transition to University in Japan.” ''American Journal of Sociology'' 97, no. 6 (1992): 1639–57.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "shadow" has four components to it: firstly, the existence of and need for tutoring is produced by the existence of the formal education system; secondly, the formal education system is the mainstream system and thus tutoring is its shadow; thirdly, the focus remains on mainstream education in schools; fourthly, tutoring is largely informal and unstructured as compared to formal or mainstream education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Confronting the Shadow Education System: What Government Policies for What Private Tutoring?|last=Bray|first=Mark|publisher=International Institute for Educational Planning|year=2009|isbn=978-92-803-1333-8|location=Paris|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a consequence of the popularity of shadow education, private tutoring can sometimes overshadow mainstream education with more priority given to enrolling in private tutoring centers. Mark Bray claims that "Especially near the time of major external examinations, schools in some countries may be perceived by pupils to be less able to cater for their specific needs."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3827">The '''UK Chess Challenge''' is an annual four-stage [[chess]] competition for school-age children from the [[United Kingdom]]. [[Michael Basman]] is credited with creating the original challenge back in 1996 and is still closely connected with the competition. The director of the tournament is Sarah Longson (née Hegarty) supported by her husband Alex Longson. Longson is former British Ladies Chess Champion and represents England at Olympiads.  {{citation needed|date=September 2017}}
Over 40,000 children play in the competition at the school stage and the eventual winner wins £2,000 and is crowned as UK Schools' Chess Challenge Champion. In 2017 Harry Grieve won the event and was presented his prize by [[Mark Price, Baron Price|Lord Price]]. The competition is generously sponsored by Delancey.

==Stages==
===School===
The first stage involves school chess clubs holding a qualifying competition to determine the strongest player for each gender-year combination, e.g. U-11 boys, U-12 girls. Each such player qualifies to enter the county Megafinal competition. For schools without chess clubs, there are alternative competitions within the county that will also enable qualification to the Megafinal.

===Megafinal===
A one-day Megafinal is held within each UK county to determine the strongest player from the county within each gender / year combination. Each such player is titled '''Supremo''' (boys) or '''Suprema''' (girls). The top player plus all those scoring 4/6 or better qualify for the Gigafinal.

===Gigafinal===
There are two one-day Gigafinals - one for Northern counties; one for Southern counties. As with the Megafinal, each Gigafinal is held to determine the strongest player for the qualifying region within each gender / year combination. Each such player is titled '''Ultimo''' (boys) or '''Ultima''' (girls). The Ultimo / Ultima players from each Gigafinal qualify to enter the Terafinal Champions competition. Until 2002, the two runners-up in each category qualified to enter the Terafinal Challengers competition. From 2003, each player scoring 5/6 or better qualifies for the Terafinal Challengers competition.

===Terafinal===
There are two two-day Terafinal competitions - the '''Terafinal Champions''' competition for the Ultimo / Ultima qualifiers from the Gigafinals, and the '''Terafinal Challengers''' competition for the runners-up. Over two days, the Champions competition identifies the strongest player in each category. Such players are titled '''Strat''' (boys or girls) and usually win a substantial prize.

==History==

WestEd was formed in 1995 when the Southwest Regional Educational Laboratory (SWRL), located in Los Alamitos, California, merged with the [[Far West Laboratory for Educational Research and Development]] (FWL), located in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;Profiles of the regional educational laboratories (SuDoc ED 1.302:P 94/13), page 23.&lt;/ref&gt; SWRL and FWL were established in 1966, shortly after the passage of the [[Elementary and Secondary Education Act]] (ESEA) (Pub.L. 89-10, 79 Stat. 27, 20 U.S.C. ch.70), a United States federal statute enacted April 11, 1965.&lt;ref&gt;From U.S. Statutes at Large, Vol. 79, p. 27 - 58 http://nysl.nysed.gov/uhtbin/cgisirsi/M8BhPv34Ie/NYSL/7400017/524/79170&lt;/ref&gt; The Act funded several areas of primary and secondary education including professional development, instructional materials, resources to support educational programs, and parental involvement promotion. FWL and SWRL were established under ESEA (1965) Title IV, which established funding for educational research and training.

==Research and Technical Assistance Centers==
WestEd operates several federal research and technical assistance centers.

===Regional Educational Laboratory West===
The [[United States Department of Education]] Regional Educational Laboratory (REL) Program is a network of ten laboratories. &lt;ref&gt;http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/edlabs/about/&lt;/ref&gt; 

WestEd was awarded the contract to operate the Regional Educational Laboratory (REL) West (serving [[Arizona]], [[California]], [[Nevada]], and [[Utah]]) for the current period, running from January 2012 through the end of 2016. &lt;ref&gt;http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/edlabs/regions/west/index.asp&lt;/ref&gt; Under the current contract, REL West partners with regional educators to form research alliances dedicated to addressing regional needs and increasing the use of data and evidence in education decision-making. &lt;ref&gt;http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/edlabs/regions/west/index.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

WestEd has operated REL West since the REL Program's inception in 1966. In the previous contract cycle (2006–2011), REL West published over 30 peer-reviewed studies &lt;ref&gt;http://relwest-archive.wested.org/&lt;/ref&gt; and held 36 technical assistance events bridging research, policy, and practice, with well over 2,000 participants. &lt;ref&gt;http://relwest.wested.org/events&lt;/ref&gt; During that period, REL West also delivered over 200 written responses to education questions from regional stakeholders and provided technical assistance to numerous state education agencies, state boards of education, legislators, local schools and districts, and professional associations.

===California Comprehensive Center===
The federal Comprehensive Centers Program is administered by the United States Department of Education, Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, School Support and Rural Programs. &lt;ref&gt; http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/oese/sst/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; http://www2.ed.gov/programs/newccp/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Comprehensive Centers Program supports 22 comprehensive centers to help increase state capacity to assist districts and schools meet their student achievement goals. &lt;ref&gt;http://www2.ed.gov/programs/newccp/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

WestEd operates the California Comprehensive Center (CA CC).&lt;ref&gt;http://cacompcenter.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Federal Centers===
WestEd is also the prime contractor operating four other Comprehensive Centers: the West Comprehensive Center, which serves [[Arizona]], [[Nevada]], and [[Utah]]; &lt;ref&gt;http://www2.ed.gov/programs/newccp/awards.html&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://westcompcenter.org/&lt;/ref&gt; the Mid-Atlantic Comprehensive Center, which serves [[Delaware]], [[Maryland]], [[New Jersey]], [[Pennsylvania]], and the [[District of Columbia]];&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.ed.gov/programs/newccp/awards.html&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://macc-atwested.org/&lt;/ref&gt; the Center on School Turnaround;&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.ed.gov/programs/newccp/awards.html&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://centeronschoolturnaround.org/#1&lt;/ref&gt; and the Center on Standards and Assessment Implementation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.ed.gov/programs/newccp/awards.html&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://csai-online.org/#2&lt;/ref&gt; 

WestEd is a subcontractor on six other regional Comprehensive Centers — performing program tasks for the Central Comprehensive Center,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.c3ta.org/AboutC3.html&lt;/ref&gt; Northeast Comprehensive Center,&lt;ref&gt; http://www.northeastcompcenter.org/?page_id=248&lt;/ref&gt; and South Central Comprehensive Center,&lt;ref&gt; http://www.sc3ta.org/AboutSC3.html&lt;/ref&gt; and performing evaluations for the Great Lakes Comprehensive Center,&lt;ref&gt; http://greatlakes-cc.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Midwest Comprehensive Center,&lt;ref&gt;http://midwest-cc.org/&lt;/ref&gt; and Pacific Regional Comprehensive Center.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.pacificcompcenter.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs and Services==
WestEd is organized into several programs that provide research, technical assistance, and services in order to “create positive, innovative, and sustainable improvements in education and human development.” &lt;ref&gt;http://www.wested.org/areas-of-work/&lt;/ref&gt; WestEd works with a range of clients at the state and local level, and is an approved service provider with several state departments of education, including the Arizona Department of Education, Colorado Department of Education, Hawaii Department of Education, Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, Tennessee Department of Education, and Washington Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction. Numerous school districts throughout the country have also selected WestEd as an approved service provider, including Baltimore City Public Schools, New York City Board of Education, Oakland Unified School District, Tucson Unified School District, and Vail School District. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.wested.org/online_pubs/AN-11-01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  

===Reading Apprenticeship===
WestEd's Reading Apprenticeship program is a research-based instructional framework that is supposed to improve the teaching effectiveness of content-area middle and high school teachers, literacy coaches, and teacher educators.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wested.org/project/reading-apprenticeship/&lt;/ref&gt; The approach helps adolescent students become more confident, engaged, and strategic readers.&lt;ref&gt;R. Schoenbach and C. Greenleaf, "Fostering Adolescents' Engaged Academic Literacy." In L. Christenbury, R. Bomer, and P. Smagorinsky (2009). New York: The Guilford Press. {{ISBN|978-1-59385-829-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. Litman and C. Greenleaf, "Traveling Together over Difficult Ground: Negotiating Success with a Profoundly Inexperienced Reading in an Introduction to Chemistry Class." In K. Hinchman and H. Sheridan-Thomas (2008). Best Practices in Adolescent Literacy Instruction. New York: The Guilford Press. {{ISBN|978-1-59385-692-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2010, WestEd received a federal Investing in Innovation (i3) grant to address the persistent academic achievement gaps in the nation's high schools by scaling up the Reading Apprenticeship model of academic literacy instruction.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.readingapprenticeship.org/cs/ra/view/sli_r/13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.data.ed.gov/grants/investing-in-innovation/applicant/15273&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; http://www2.ed.gov/programs/innovation/2010/applications.html#validation&lt;/ref&gt; This collaborative effort is providing research-based, discipline-focused professional development to 2,800 high school of biology, U.S. history, and English language arts; and is reaching more than 400,000 students in 300 schools.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.data.ed.gov/grants/investing-in-innovation/applicant/15273&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.wested.org/research_study/reading-apprenticeship-improving-secondary-education-raise/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, WestEd received another i3 grant from the U.S. Department of Education to adapt a rigorously researched face-to-face Reading Apprenticeship professional development model into an alternative web-based model for high school science teachers: Internet-Based Reading Apprenticeship Improving Science Education (iRAISE). During the three-year grant period, 150 teachers and 33,000 students will be impacted by the iRAISE professional development. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.readingapprenticeship.org/cs/ra/view/sli_r/15&lt;/ref&gt;  

The first Reading Apprenticeship study was conducted in 1996-1997 in one San Francisco public high school. Students gained an average of two years growth in seven months of instruction measured on a standardized reading comprehension test, while engaging in rigorous, academic work rather than remediation focused on basic skills.&lt;ref&gt;Schoenbach, R., C. Greenleaf, C. Cziko, and L. Hurwitz (1999). Reading for Understanding: A Guide to Improving Reading in Middle and High School Classrooms. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass/John Wiley &amp; Sons. {{ISBN|978-0-7879-5045-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guzzetti, B. (2007). Literacy for the New Millennium: Adolescent literacy. Praeger. {{ISBN|978-0-275-98994-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program tenets and the results were published in the book, ''Reading for Understanding'' (San Francisco: Jossey-Bass), which recently had its second edition published.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.josseybass.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470608315.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, A Randomized Controlled Study of the Efficacy of Reading Apprenticeship Professional Development for High School History and Science Teaching and Learning was funded by the [[Institute of Education Sciences]], National Center for Education Research.&lt;ref&gt;http://ies.ed.gov/funding/grantsearch/details.asp?ID=339&lt;/ref&gt; Reading Apprenticeship is one of only two supplemental literacy programs selected by the [[Institute of Education Sciences]] for a rigorous evaluation, initiated in 2006.

In 2008, the Enhanced Reading Opportunities Study, also funded by the [[Institute for Education Sciences]], reported that Reading Apprenticeship Academic Literacy had a positive and statistically significant impact on reading comprehension test scores (0.14 standard deviation; p-value = 0.015).&lt;ref&gt;http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/pubs/20094036/index.asp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"'No Effects' Studies Raising Eyebrows" (April 1, 2009) Education Week, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The 2010 Final Report of the Enhanced Reading Opportunities Study indicated, “Overall, the findings from these reports show that over the course of ninth grade, the ERO programs [Reading Apprenticeship Academic Literacy and Xtreme Reading] improved students’ reading comprehension skills and helped them perform better academically in their high school course work.” &lt;ref&gt; Somers, M.-A., Corrin, W., Sepanik, S., Salinger T., Levin, J., and Zmach, C. (2010). The Enhanced Reading Opportunities Study Final Report: The Impact of Supplemental Literacy Courses for Struggling Ninth-Grade Readers (NCEE 2010-4021).

This is accomplished through "training-of-trainers" institutes, regional outreach activities, training materials, and demonstration programs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cainclusivechildcare.org/bt/ Retrieved October 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the California Map to Inclusive Child Care project provides a statewide system of support, information and resources for families and providers to facilitate barrier–free access to inclusive child care for children birth to 21.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cainclusivechildcare.org/camap/index.html Retrieved October 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

PITC worked with the Administration for Children, Youth, and Families to develop the Early Head Start program, and has presented training institutes and technical assistance for more than 500 programs serving families with children from birth to three.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca S. New and Moncrieff Cochran. Early Childhood Education [Four Volumes]  An International Encyclopedia. Praeger Publishers, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; PITC staff have worked with representatives of 19 states, &lt;ref&gt;http://www.pitc.org/pub/pitc_docs/ww.html&lt;/ref&gt; and over 7,500 trainers, college faculty, and program directors have attended PITC training modules since 1990. In 2002, the [[National Center for Children in Poverty]] selected PITC as a model initiative to support infants, toddlers, and their families. The Center for Child and Family Studies and the University of Cincinnati are codeveloping an online associate degree program for early Head Start teachers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uc.edu/news/NR.aspx?id=10648 Retrieved October 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Making Sense of SCIENCE===
Making Sense of SCIENCE (formerly "Understanding Science") is a nationally field-tested professional development program that helps teachers learn major concepts of K-8 science, examine how children make sense of those concepts, and analyze and improve their science teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Heller, J. I., Daehler, K., &amp; Shinohara, M. (2003, Fall). Connecting all the pieces: Using an
evaluation mosaic to answer an impossible question. Journal of Staff Development, 24, 36-
41.&lt;/ref&gt; Making Sense of SCIENCE professional development modules help teachers actively learn science in combination with student thinking and teaching. Each module focuses on cases of actual classroom practice that illustrate students’ science ideas and highlight an important teaching dilemma, one that any teacher might face.&lt;ref&gt;Daehler, K. R., &amp; Shinohara, M. (2001). A complete circuit is a complete circle: Exploring the potential of case materials and methods to develop teachers’ content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge of science.

Distributed by the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, Southfield, MI.&lt;/ref&gt; The principal investigators are Kirsten Daehler and Mayumi Shinohara.

In 2005, the [[Institute of Education Sciences]], National Center for Education Research funded the development of three teacher professional development courses in the Making Sense of SCIENCE series that address challenging physical science and earth science topics: heat and energy, plate tectonics, and climate and weather.&lt;ref&gt;http://ies.ed.gov/funding/grantsearch/details.asp?ID=522&lt;/ref&gt; This development grant includes three small, randomized controlled studies to assess the potential efficacy of each of these courses separately to improve teacher content knowledge and student learning, and the reduction of the science achievement gap between English learners and English-proficient speakers. A fourth study will assess the potential efficacy of the entire sequence of courses on teacher knowledge and student science achievement. In 2009 the [[Institute of Education Sciences]] funded a [[Cluster randomised controlled trial|randomized-cluster]] experimental design study, Impact of the Making Sense of SCIENCE Professional Development Model on Science Achievement of English Language Learner Students, to evaluate the effects of WestEd's Making Sense of SCIENCE model of professional development &amp;mdash; an approach that emphasizes inquiry-based instruction practices that depend less on English proficiency, textbook knowledge, and direct instruction &amp;mdash; on student achievement in science, especially English language learner students.&lt;ref&gt;http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/edlabs/projects/rct_87.asp&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Science Foundation]] has funded a large-scale study, Learning Science for Teaching: Effects of Content-Rich and Practice-Based Professional Development Models on Teacher Content Knowledge, Classroom Practice, and Student Learning, examining the effects of promising professional development models on teachers, classrooms, and students.&lt;ref&gt;http://cse.edc.org/tpc/projects/default.asp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=12785&amp;org=EHR&amp;from=fund&lt;/ref&gt;
