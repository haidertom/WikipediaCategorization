'''Abstract space''', in [[geography]], is a hypothetical [[space]] characterized by equal and consistent properties; a geographic space that is completely [[homogeneity (physics)|homogeneous]]. All movement and activity would be equally easy or difficult in all directions and all locations within this space. This concept is useful for modeling or analyzing spatial activity and behavior by limiting or eliminating [[extraneous variables]], such as terrain. For example, if researchers want to study the relationship between culture and trade, they don’t want their model to be overwhelmed or influenced by factors such as mountainous barriers and rivers because these would detract from the purpose of modeling how culture alone effects trade.

'''''The American Practical Navigator''''' (colloquially often referred to as '''''Bowditch'''''), originally written by [[Nathaniel Bowditch]], is an encyclopedia of [[navigation]]. It serves as a valuable handbook on [[oceanography]] and [[meteorology]], and contains useful tables and a maritime glossary. In 1867 the [[copyright]] and [[Lithography|plates]] were bought by the [[Hydrographic office#United States|Hydrographic Office]] of the [[United States Navy]], and as a U.S. Government publication, it is now available free online. It is considered one of America's nautical institutions.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

==History==
The most popular navigational text of the late 18th century was ''The New Practical Navigator'' by [[John Hamilton Moore]] of the [[Royal Navy]], first published in 1772. To have exact tables to work from, Bowditch recomputed all of Moore's tables, and rearranged and expanded the work. He contacted the US publisher of the work, [[Edmund March Blunt]], who asked him to correct and revise the third edition on his fifth voyage. The task was so extensive that Bowditch decided to write his own book, and to "put down in the book nothing I can't teach the crew." On that trip, it is said that every man of the crew of 12, including the ship's cook, became competent to take and calculate lunar observations and to plot the correct position of the ship. ''The New Practical Navigator'' was published in 1799, followed by a second edition in 1800.

By 1802, when Blunt was ready to publish a third edition, Nathaniel Bowditch and others had corrected so many errors in Moore's work that Blunt decided to publish it as the first edition of a new work, ''The New American Practical Navigator''. The current edition of the ''American Practical Navigator'' traces its pedigree to that 1802 edition. Edmund M. Blunt continued to publish the book until 1833; upon his retirement, his sons, Edmund and George, assumed publication. The elder Blunt died in 1862; his son Edmund followed in 1866. The next year, 1867, George Blunt sold the copyright to the government for $25,000. The government has published ''Bowditch'' ever since. George Blunt died in 1878.

Nathaniel Bowditch continued to correct and revise the book until his death in 1838. Upon his death, the editorial responsibility for ''The New American Practical Navigator'' passed to his son, [[Ingersoll Bowditch|J. Ingersoll Bowditch]]. Very few significant changes were made under him. Editions from 1837 through 1880 are nearly identical in content. Ingersoll Bowditch continued editing the ''Navigator'' until George Blunt sold the copyright to the government. He outlived all of the principals involved in publishing and editing the ''Navigator'', dying in 1889.

The U.S. government has published some 52 editions since acquiring the copyright to the book that has come to be known simply by its original author’s name, "Bowditch". Since the government began production, the book has been known by its year of publishing, instead of by the edition number. After the first major revision, a total overhaul of the book's content completed in 1880 under the direction of Commander [[Philip H. Cooper]], USN, the name was changed to ''American Practical Navigator''. Much of Bowditch’s original content, including his methods for clearing [[Lunar distance (navigation)|lunar distance]] observations, were dropped in 1880 (though a new method for clearing lunars remained in an appendix until the early 20th&amp;nbsp;century). After numerous incremental revisions and printings in the period from 1914 to 1944, ''Bowditch'' was extensively revised between 1946 and 1958.

[[File:Nathaniel Bowditch (1773-1838), American mathematician and actuary.jpeg|thumb|Nathaniel Bowditch]]
The present volume, while retaining the basic format of the 1958 version, reorganizes the subjects, deletes obsolete text, and adds new material to keep pace with the extensive changes in navigation that have taken place in the electronic age.

The 1995 edition of the ''American Practical Navigator'' incorporates extensive changes in organization, content, and format. Recent advances in navigational electronics, communications, positioning, and other technologies have transformed the way navigation is practiced at sea, and it is clear that even more changes are forthcoming. The changes to this edition of ''Bowditch'' are intended to ensure that this publication remains the premier reference work for practical marine navigation. Concerted efforts were made to return to Nathaniel Bowditch’s original intention "to put down in the book nothing I can’t teach the crew." To this end, many complex formulas and equations have been eliminated, and emphasis placed on the capabilities and limitations of various navigation systems and how to use them, instead of explaining complex technical and theoretical details. This edition replaces but does not cancel former editions, which may be retained and consulted as to navigation methods not discussed herein.
Current edition (as of June 2017) is Edition 53, a two-volume, all-digital version released by NGA in 2017.

The Bicentennial Edition (2002) incorporated Volume 1 and Volume 2 into a single printed volume, with the goal of putting as much useful information before the navigator as possible in the most understandable and readable format, a single, hard-bound volume. While that edition saw widespread use in civilian, military and commercial fleets, it sacrificed some data on classical celestial navigation and on advances in satellite and electronic navigation to meet the compressed requirements of the physical form factor. Twenty years later, with a resurgence in interest on celestial navigation and the large-scale adoption of electronic navigation, NGA returned Pub No. 9 to a two-volume format to encompass the expanded material. To eliminate printing costs, NGA does not intend to produce a physical version of the 2017 edition.

[[Image:Brunton.JPG|thumb|A standard Brunton Geo, used commonly by geologists]]
A '''Brunton compass''', properly known as the '''Brunton Pocket Transit''', is a precision [[compass]] made by [[Brunton, Inc.]] of [[Riverton, WY|Riverton]], [[Wyoming]]. The instrument was patented in 1894 by a Canadian-born geologist named David W. Brunton. Unlike most modern compasses, the Brunton Pocket Transit utilizes [[Magnetic damping|magnetic induction damping]] rather than fluid to damp needle oscillation.  Although Brunton, Inc. makes many other types of magnetic compasses, the Brunton Pocket Transit is a specialized instrument used widely by those needing to make accurate navigational and slope-angle measurements in the field. Users are primarily [[geologist]]s, but [[archaeologist]]s, [[environmental engineer]]s, [[mining engineer]]s and [[surveying|surveyor]]s also make use of the Brunton's capabilities. The [[United States Army]] has adopted the Pocket Transit as the M2 Compass for use by crew-served [[artillery]].

==Overview==
The Pocket Transit may be adjusted for [[Earth's magnetic field|declination angle]] according to one's location on the Earth. It is used to get directional degree measurements ([[azimuth]]) through use of the [[Earth's magnetic field]].  Holding the compass at waist-height, the user looks down into the mirror and lines up the target, needle, and guide line that is on the mirror.  Once all three are lined up and the compass is level, the reading for that azimuth can be made.  Arguably the most frequent use for the Brunton in the field is the calculation of the [[strike and dip]] of [[Geology|geological]] features ([[Fault (geology)|faults]], contacts, [[foliation]], [[Stratum|sedimentary strata]], etc.).  Strike is measured by leveling (with the [[bull's eye level]]) the compass along the plane being measured.  Dip is taken by laying the side of the compass perpendicular to the strike measurement and rotating horizontal level until the bubble is stable and the reading has been made.  If field conditions allow, additional features of the compass allow users to measure such geological attributes from a distance.

As with most traditional compasses, directional measurements are made in reference to the [[Earth's magnetic field]]. Thus, measurements are sensitive to magnetic intereference.  For example, if the user is near an outcrop that contains [[magnetite]] or some other [[iron]]-bearing material, compass readings can be affected anywhere from several inches from the [[outcrop]] to tens of yards away (depending on the strength of the magnetic field).  Since they are measured with a rotating [[Spirit level|level]], dip measurements are unaffected by magnetic interference.

==Other compasses==
There are numerous other compasses used by geologists: The [[Breithaupt compass]] is one example. Portable electronic devices are changing the way geologists conduct field work. Unlike analogue compasses, a digital compass relies on an accelerometer and a magnetometer, and may provide information about the reliability of a measurement (e.g. by repeating the same measurement and performing statistical analysis).

== Uses ==
# Taking a bearing
# Measuring vertical angles with clinometer
# Defining points of the same elevation
# Measuring strike and dip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Assaad|editor1-first=Fakhry A.|editor2-last=LaMoreaux|editor2-first=James W.|editor3-last=Hughes|editor3-first=Travis|title=Field Methods for Geologists and Hydrogeologists|date=2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|pages=38–39|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=qjzvCAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;dq=Brunton%20compass&amp;pg=PA37#v=onepage&amp;q=Brunton%20compass&amp;f=false|accessdate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1077">'''COGO''' is a suite of programs used in [[civil engineering]] for solving coordinate geometry problems.

COGO was originally a subsystem of [[MIT]]'s Integrated Civil Engineering System ('''ICES'''), developed in the 1960s. Other ICES subsystems included STRUDL, BRIDGE, LEASE, PROJECT, ROADS and TRANSET, and the internal languages ICETRAN and CDL. Evolved versions of COGO are still widely used.

Some basic types of elements of COGO are points, spirals, lines and horizontal curves (circular arcs).

More complex elements can be developed such as alignments or chains which are made up of a combination of points, curves or spirals.

In 1764, at the behest of Empress [[Maria Theresa of Austria]], a complete [[surveying|survey]] of the Habsburg lands was begun,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pitt.edu/~votruba/qsonhist/urbariummariatheresa.html |title=Maria Theresa's Urbarium |last=Votruba |first=Martin |work=Slovak Studies Program |publisher=University of Pittsburgh }}&lt;/ref&gt; initiated by the general staff of the Imperial and Royal Army under Field Marshal [[Count Leopold Joseph von Daun]], who had become aware of the lack of reliable maps in the [[Seven Years' War]]. Maria Theresa's son Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] ordered the implication of a complete [[urbarium]] for [[property tax]] purposes in 1785. The present-day cadastre was completed after the [[Napoleonic Wars]] from 1817 onwards under Emperor [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I of Austria]] (''Franziszeischer Kataster''). Since then, the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] (i.e. [[Cisleithania]]n) crown lands were subdivided in ''Katastralgemeinden''; surveying in the [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian]] (Transleithanian) lands started in 1850. Municipalities as administrative subdivisions with certain rights of [[self-governance]] were not established until after the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|1848 revolutions]].

Most of the nowadays ''Katastralgemeinden'' once had been independent communes and were incorporated on the occasion of a municipal territory reforms. They can be further divided into smaller villages and localities (''Ortschaften''). {{As of|2014}} there are 7,847 Katastralgemeinden in Austria. For land registration, the unit identifier used in a ''Katastralgemeinde'' is "KG-Nr" (KG-Nummer, or number).&lt;ref name=CT-AT/&gt;

The Dutch system of ''kadastrale gemeenten'' was set up around 1830. When municipalities are merged, often the cadastral communes remain as they were, so one civil municipality can consist of more than one cadastral commune; but again, a cadastral commune can never be part of more than one civil municipality.

See [[Code officiel géographique]].

== Germany ==
In [[Germany]] the Official Municipality Key serves [[statistics|statistical]] purposes and is issued by the statistics offices of individual German [[States of Germany|states]].  The municipality key is to be indicated in instances such as changing residence on the notice of departure or registration documents.  This is done at the registration office in every town's [[city hall (administration)|city hall]].

=== Structure ===
The municipality key consists of eight digits, which are generated as follows: The {{color|red|'''first two numbers'''}} designate the individual German state.  The {{color|blue|'''third digit'''}} designates the government district (in areas without government districts a zero is used instead).  The {{color|green|'''fourth and fifth digits'''}} designate the number of the urban area (in a district-free city) or the district (in a city with districts).  The {{color|purple|'''sixth, seventh, and eighth digits'''}} indicate the municipality or the number of the unincorporated area.

==== Examples ====
{{color|red|'''08'''}} {{color|blue|'''1'''}} {{color|green|'''11'''}} {{color|purple|'''000'''}}: [[Stuttgart]]

* {{color|red|'''08'''}}: [[Baden-Württemberg]]

===Structure===

Usually known as the municipal code or {{va|PSGC code}}, the number comprises nine digits rrppmmbbb, for which rr = region code, pp = province code, {{nowrap|1=mm = city / municipality}} code, bbb = barangay code.

For example, the municipality of [[Ubay, Bohol]] has a code of 071246000 meaning region 07 (Central Visayas), province 12 (Bohol), municipality 46 (Ubay) with barangay code of zero signifying "not at this level." [[Bongbong]], one of its constituent barangays, has a code of 071246007.

The province code is unique and is independent of the region code. All PSGCs, are therefore, unique.

== Sweden ==
A '''kommunkod''' (municipal code) is a numerical code given to all [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[Municipalities of Sweden|municipalities]] by the Swedish tax authorities.  The code consists of four digits, the first two indicating which [[counties of Sweden|county]] the municipality is situated in, and the last two specific for the municipality.

The code system was introduced with the municipal reform of 1952. There were three different categories of municipalities at the time, which affected the number that they were allocated. Those with [[Stad (Sweden)|stad]]-status (cities) were given codes ending in 80 to 99, smaller towns ([[köping]]) 60 to 79 and [[Rural municipality|rural municipalities]] 01 to 59. The county seats were allocated codes ending in 80.

As part of the reform in the early 1970s, the categorization of municipalities was abolished, but the code was in most cases preserved. When several municipalities were merged, the code for the biggest municipality was kept.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6461">'''Digital mapping''' (also called digital [[cartography]]) is the process by which a collection of data is compiled and formatted into a virtual image. The primary function of this technology is to produce [[map]]s that give accurate representations of a particular area, detailing major road arteries and other points of interest. The technology also allows the calculation of distances from one place to another.

Although digital mapping can be found in a variety of computer applications the main use of these maps is with the [[Global Positioning System]], or [[GPS]] satellite network, used in standard [[automotive navigation system]]s.

==History==

===From paper to paperless===
The roots of digital mapping lie within traditional paper maps such as the [[Thomas Guide]] and [[Geographers' A–Z Street Atlas]]. Paper maps provide basic landscapes similar to digitized road maps, yet are often cumbersome, cover only a designated area, and lack many specific details such as road blocks. In addition, there is no way to “update” a paper map except to obtain a new version. On the other hand, digital maps, in many cases, can be updated through synchronization with updates from company servers.

===Expanded capabilities===
Early digital maps had the same basic functionality as paper maps—that is, they provided a “virtual view” of roads generally outlined by the terrain encompassing the surrounding area. However, as digital maps have grown with the expansion of GPS technology in the past decade, live traffic updates,&lt;ref name = "Live Traffic Updates"&gt;"Navigation device assisting road traffic congestion management." FreshPatents.com. 9 March 2007. http://www.freshpatents.com/Navigation-device-assisting-road-traffic-congestion-management-dt20080925ptan20080234921.php. 12 Oct. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; points of interest and service locations have been added to enhance digital maps to be more “user conscious."&lt;ref name = "EET"&gt;Husby, Jonathon. "In-car navigation matures beyond ‘Point A to Point B’." Electronic Engineering Times. 28 Jan. 2008. http://www.automotivedesignline.com. 12 Oct. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional “virtual views” are now only part of digital mapping. In many cases, users can choose between virtual maps, satellite (aerial views), and hybrid (a combination of virtual map and aerial views) views. With the ability to update and expand digital mapping devices, newly constructed roads and places can be added to appear on maps.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Three-dimensional maps of landscapes can be generated using [[3D scanner]]s or [[3D reconstruction]] software.&lt;ref&gt;Remondino, Fabio. "[https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/3/6/1104htm Heritage recording and 3D modeling with photogrammetry and 3D scanning]." Remote Sensing 3.6 (2011): 1104-1138.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data collection==
Digital maps heavily rely upon a vast amount of data collected over time. Most of the information that comprise digital maps is the culmination of satellite imagery as well as street level information. Maps must be updated frequently to provide users with the most accurate reflection of a location. While there is a wide spectrum on companies that specialize in digital mapping, the basic premise is that digital maps will accurately portray roads as they actually appear to give "life-like experiences." &lt;ref name = "Tele Atlas"&gt;"City Maps" Tele Atlas BV. 2008. http://www.teleatlas.com/OurProducts/MapEnhancementProducts/CityMaps/index.htm. 12 Oct. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functionality and use==

===Computer applications===
Proprietary and non-proprietary computer programs and applications provide imagery and street-level map data for much of the world.

===Scientific applications===
The development of mobile computing ([[PDAs]], [[tablet computer|tablet PCs]], [[laptops]], etc.) has recently (since about 2000) spurred the use of digital mapping in the sciences and [[applied science]]s. {{as of|2009}}, science fields that use digital mapping technology include [[geology]] (see [[Digital geologic mapping]]), [[engineering]], [[architecture]], [[land surveying]], [[mining]], [[forestry]], [[Environmental science|environmental]], and [[archaeology]].

===GPS navigation systems===
The principal use by which digital mapping has grown in the past decade has been its connection to [[Global Positioning System]] ([[GPS]]) technology.&lt;ref name = "GPS"&gt;"United States Updates Global Positioning System Technology." America.gov. 3 Feb. 2006. http://www.america.gov/st/washfile-english/2006/February/20060203125928lcnirellep0.5061609.html. 12 Oct. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; GPS is the foundation behind digital mapping navigation systems.

==== How it works ====

The coordinates and position as well as [[atomic time]] obtained by a [[Earth|terrestrial]] GPS receiver from GPS satellites [[orbiting]] [[Earth]] interact together to provide the digital mapping programming with points of origin in addition to the destination points needed to calculate distance. This information is then analyzed and compiled to create a map that provides the easiest and most efficient way to reach a destination.
:More technically speaking, the device operates in the following manner:&lt;ref name = "U.S. G.P.S."&gt;"How Does GPS Work?" Smithsonian Institution. 1998. http://www.nasm.si.edu/exhibitions/gps/work.html. 12 Oct. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
# GPS receivers collect data from at least four GPS satellites orbiting the Earth, calculating position in [[Three-dimensional space|three dimensions]].
# The GPS receiver then utilizes position to provide [[GPS coordinates]], or exact points of latitudinal and longitudinal direction from GPS satellites.
# The points, or coordinates, output an accurate range between approximately "10-20 meters" of the actual location.
# The beginning point, entered via GPS coordinates, and the ending point, (address or coordinates) input by the user, are then entered into the digital mapping software.
# The mapping software outputs a real-time visual representation of the route. The map then moves along the path of the driver.
# If the driver drifts from the designated route, the navigation system will use the current coordinates to recalculate a route to the destination location.

[[File:Earth elevation histogram 2.svg|thumb|350px|Elevation [[histogram]] of the Earth's surface, of which approximately 71% is covered with water]]

The '''elevation''' of a [[geographic]] [[location (geography)|location]] is its height above or below a fixed reference point, most commonly a reference [[geoid]], a mathematical model of the [[Earth]]'s [[sea level]] as an [[equipotential]] [[gravitation]]al [[equipotential surface|surface]] (see [[Geodetic datum#Vertical datum|Geodetic datum § Vertical datum]]).
The term ''elevation'' is mainly used when referring to points on the Earth's surface, while ''[[altitude]]'' or ''[[geopotential height]]'' is used for points above the surface, such as an aircraft in flight or a [[spacecraft]] in orbit, and ''[[three-dimensional space|depth]]'' is used for points below the surface.
&lt;!-- [[File:Earth surface NGDC 2000.jpg|left|350px|]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;This image was generated by NOAA from digital data bases of land and sea-floor elevations on a 2-minute latitude/longitude grid (1 minute of latitude = 1 nautical mile, or 1.853 km). Assumed illumination is from the west; shading is computed as a function of the east-west slope of the surface with a nonlinear exaggeration favoring low-relief areas. A Mercator projection was used for the world image, which spans 390° of longitude from 270° West around the world eastward to 120° East; latitude coverage is ±80°. The resolution of the gridded data varies from true 2-minute for the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Ocean floors and all land masses to 5 minutes for the Arctic Ocean floor.&lt;/small&gt; --&gt;

Elevation is not to be confused with the distance from the center of the Earth. Due to the [[equatorial bulge]], the summits of [[Mount Everest]] and [[Chimborazo (volcano)|Chimborazo]] have, respectively, the largest elevation and the largest geocentric distance.

==Maps and GIS==
[[File:Topomapcropped.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Part of a [[topographic map]] of [[Haleakala]] ([[Hawaii]]), showing elevation.]]
[[File:Satellite image of Cape peninsula.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Landsat]] Image over [[SRTM]] Elevation by [[NASA]], showing the [[Cape Peninsula]] and [[Cape of Good Hope]], [[South Africa]] in the foreground.[http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA04961] ]]GIS or [[geographic information system]] is a computer system that allows for visualizing, manipulating, capturing, and storage of data with associated attributes. GIS offers better understanding of patterns and relationships of the landscape at different scales. Tools inside the GIS allow for manipulation of data for spatial analysis or cartography.[[Image:srtm ramp2.world.21600x10800.jpg|thumb|300px|Heightmap of Earth's surface (including water and ice) in [[equirectangular projection]], normalized as 8-bit grayscale, where lighter values indicate higher elevation.]]
A [[topographic map|topographical map]] is the main type of [[map]] used to depict elevation, often through use of [[contour line]]s.
In a [[Geographic Information System]] (GIS), [[digital elevation model]]s (DEM) are commonly used to represent the surface (topography) of a place, through a [[raster graphics|raster]] (grid) dataset of elevations.  [[Digital terrain model]]s are another way to represent terrain in GIS.

USGS (United States Geologic Survey) is developing a 3D Elevation Program (3DEP) to keep up with growing needs for high quality topographic data. 3DEP is a collection of enhanced elevation data in the form of high quality LiDAR data over the conterminous United States, Hawaii, and the U.S. territories. There are three bare earth DEM layers in 3DEP which are nationally seamless at the resolution of 1/3, 1, and 2 arcseconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nationalmap.gov/elevation.html|title=The National Map: Elevation|last=Survey|first=U.S. Geological|website=nationalmap.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global 1-kilometer map==
This map is derived from [[GTOPO30]] data that describes the elevation of Earth's terrain at intervals of 30 arcseconds (approximately 1&amp;nbsp;km).  It uses color and shading instead of contour lines to indicate elevation.

==Hypsography==
{{split section|Hypsography|date=July 2014}}
'''Hypsography''' is the study of the distribution of elevations on the surface of the [[Earth]], although the term is sometimes also applied to other rocky planets such as [[Mars]] or [[Venus]]. The term originates from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|ὕψος}} "hypsos" meaning height. Most often it is used only in reference to elevation of land but a complete description of Earth's solid surface requires a description of the seafloor as well. Related to the term [[hypsometry]], the measurement of these elevations of a planet's solid surface are taken relative to [[Arithmetic mean|mean]] [[datum (geodesy)|datum]], except for Earth which is taken relative to the [[sea level]].
[[File:EarthHypso.png|thumb|center|600px|Hypsography of the Earth. Notice that Earth has two peaks in elevation, one for the continents, the other for the ocean floors.]]

==Temperature==
In the [[troposphere]], [[temperatures]] decrease with altitude. This [[lapse rate]] is approximately 6.5&amp;nbsp;°C/km.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.classzone.com/books/earth_science/terc/content/investigations/es1706/es1706page04.cfm Quantifying Elevation and Temperature]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Other uses|Frame of reference (disambiguation)}}
{{Classical mechanics |Fundamentals}}

In [[physics]], a '''frame of reference''' (or '''reference frame''') consists of an abstract [[coordinate system]] and the set of physical reference points that uniquely fix (locate and orient) the coordinate system and standardize measurements.

In n dimensions, n+1 reference points are sufficient to fully define a reference frame. Using [[Cartesian coordinate system|rectangular (Cartesian) coordinates]], a reference frame may be defined with a reference point at the origin and a reference point at one unit distance along each of the n coordinate axes.

In [[Theory of relativity|Einsteinian relativity]], reference frames are used to specify the relationship between a moving [[Observer (special relativity)|observer]] and the phenomenon or phenomena under observation. In this context, the phrase often becomes "'''observational frame of reference'''" (or "'''observational reference frame'''"), which implies that the observer is at rest in the frame, although not necessarily located at its [[origin (mathematics)|origin]]. A relativistic reference frame includes (or implies) the [[coordinate time]], which does not correspond across different frames [[relative motion|moving relatively]] to each other. The situation thus differs from [[Galilean relativity]], where all possible coordinate times are essentially equivalent.

== Different aspects of "frame of reference" ==
The need to distinguish between the various meanings of "frame of reference" has led to a variety of terms. For example, sometimes the type of coordinate system is attached as a modifier, as in ''Cartesian frame of reference''. Sometimes the state of motion is emphasized, as in ''[[Rotating reference frame|rotating frame of reference]]''. Sometimes the way it transforms to frames considered as related is emphasized as in ''[[Galilean frame of reference]]''. Sometimes frames are distinguished by the scale of their observations, as in ''macroscopic'' and ''microscopic frames of reference''.&lt;ref name=macroscopic&gt;The distinction between macroscopic and microscopic frames shows up, for example, in electromagnetism where [[Constitutive equation|constitutive relations]] of various time and length scales are used to determine the current and charge densities entering [[Maxwell's equations]]. See, for example, {{cite book |title=Electromagnetic and Optical Pulse Propagation 1: Spectral Representations in Temporally Dispersive Media |author=Kurt Edmund Oughstun |page=165 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=behRnNRiueAC&amp;pg=PA165&amp;dq=macroscopic+frame++electromagnetism|isbn=0-387-34599-X |year=2006 |publisher=Springer}}. These distinctions also appear in thermodynamics. See {{cite book |title=Classical Theory |author=Paul McEvoy |page=205 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dj0wFIxn-PoC&amp;pg=PA206&amp;dq=macroscopic+frame#PPA205,M1 |isbn=1-930832-02-8 |year=2002 |publisher=MicroAnalytix}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this article, the term ''observational frame of reference'' is used when emphasis is upon the ''state of motion'' rather than upon the coordinate choice or the character of the observations or observational apparatus. In this sense, an observational frame of reference allows study of the effect of motion upon an entire family of coordinate systems that could be attached to this frame. On the other hand, a ''coordinate system'' may be employed for many purposes where the state of motion is not the primary concern. For example, a coordinate system may be adopted to take advantage of the symmetry of a system. In a still broader perspective, the formulation of many problems in physics employs ''[[generalized coordinates]]'', ''[[normal modes]]'' or ''[[eigenvectors]]'', which are only indirectly related to space and time. It seems useful to divorce the various aspects of a reference frame for the discussion below. We therefore take observational frames of reference, coordinate systems, and observational equipment as independent concepts, separated as below:

*An observational frame (such as an [[inertial frame]] or [[non-inertial frame of reference]]) is a physical concept related to state of motion.
*A coordinate system is a mathematical concept, amounting to a choice of language used to describe observations.&lt;ref name =Pontriagin&gt;

In very general terms, a coordinate system is a set of arcs ''x''&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; (''t'') in a complex [[Lie group]]; see {{cite book |author=Lev Semenovich Pontri͡agin |title=L.S. Pontryagin: Selected Works Vol. 2: Topological Groups |page= 429 |year=  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JU0DT_wXu2oC&amp;pg=PA429&amp;dq=algebra+%22coordinate+system%22|isbn=2-88124-133-6 |publisher=Gordon and Breach|edition=3rd }}. Less abstractly, a coordinate system in a space of n-dimensions is defined in terms of a basis set of vectors {'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,… '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}; see {{cite book |title=Linear Algebra: A Geometric Approach |author1=Edoardo Sernesi |author2=J. Montaldi |page=95 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1dZOuFo1QYMC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;dq=algebra+%22coordinate+system%22|isbn=0-412-40680-2 |year=1993 |publisher=CRC Press   }} As such, the coordinate system is a mathematical construct, a language, that may be related to motion, but has no necessary connection to motion.

&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, an observer in an observational frame of reference can choose to employ any coordinate system (Cartesian, polar, curvilinear, generalized, …) to describe observations made from that frame of reference. A change in the choice of this coordinate system does not change an observer's state of motion, and so does not entail a change in the observer's ''observational'' frame of reference. This viewpoint can be found elsewhere as well.&lt;ref name=Johansson&gt;

|publisher=Nova Publishers 
|year=2006  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Which is not to dispute that some coordinate systems may be a better choice for some observations than are others.

*Choice of what to measure and with what observational apparatus is a matter separate from the observer's state of motion and choice of coordinate system.

Here is a quotation applicable to moving observational frames &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{R}&lt;/math&gt; and various associated Euclidean three-space coordinate systems [''R'', ''R′'', ''etc.'']:&lt;ref name=Lyle &gt;{{cite book  |title=Handbook of Continuum Mechanics: General Concepts, Thermoelasticity |page= 9 |author1=Jean Salençon |author2=Stephen Lyle |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H3xIED8ctfUC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=physical+%22frame+of+reference%22|isbn=3-540-41443-6 |year=2001 |publisher=Springer  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cquote|We first introduce the notion of ''reference frame'', itself related to the idea of ''observer'': the reference frame is, in some sense, the "Euclidean space carried by the observer". Let us give a more mathematical definition:… the reference frame is... the set of all points in the Euclidean space with the rigid body motion of the observer. The frame, denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{R}&lt;/math&gt;, is said to move with the observer.… The spatial positions of particles are labelled relative to a frame &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{R}&lt;/math&gt; by establishing a ''coordinate system'' ''R'' with origin ''O''. The corresponding set of axes, sharing the rigid body motion of the frame &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{R}&lt;/math&gt;, can be considered to give a physical realization of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{R}&lt;/math&gt;. In a frame &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{R}&lt;/math&gt;, coordinates are changed from ''R'' to ''R′'' by carrying out, at each instant of time, the same coordinate transformation on the components of ''intrinsic'' objects (vectors and tensors) introduced to represent physical quantities ''in this frame''.| Jean Salençon, Stephen Lyle ''Handbook of Continuum Mechanics: General Concepts, Thermoelasticity'' p. 9}}

{{Cquote|As noted by Brillouin, a distinction between mathematical sets of coordinates and physical frames of reference must be made.

{{Cquote|The idea of a reference frame is really quite different from that of a coordinate system. Frames differ just when they define different ''spaces'' (sets of ''rest'' points) or times (sets of simultaneous events). So the ideas of a space, a time, of rest and simultaneity, go inextricably together with that of frame. However, a mere shift of origin, or a purely spatial rotation of space coordinates results in a new coordinate system. So frames correspond at best to ''classes'' of coordinate systems.|Graham Nerlich: ''What Spacetime Explains'', p. 64}}

{{Cquote|In traditional developments of special and general relativity it has been customary not to distinguish between two quite distinct ideas. The first is the notion of a coordinate system, understood simply as the smooth, invertible assignment of four numbers to events in spacetime neighborhoods. The second, the frame of reference, refers to an idealized system used to assign such numbers …  To avoid unnecessary restrictions, we can divorce this arrangement from metrical notions. … Of special importance for our purposes is that each frame of reference has a definite state of motion at each event of spacetime.…Within the context of special relativity and as long as we restrict ourselves to frames of reference in inertial motion, then little of importance depends on the difference between an inertial frame of reference and the inertial coordinate system it induces. This comfortable circumstance ceases immediately once we begin to consider frames of reference in nonuniform motion even within special relativity.…More recently, to negotiate the obvious ambiguities of Einstein’s treatment, the notion of frame of reference has reappeared as a structure distinct from a coordinate system.|John D.

where ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', ''etc.'' are the ''n'' Cartesian coordinates of the point. Given these functions,  '''coordinate surfaces''' are defined by the relations:

As is apparent from these remarks, a coordinate system is a [[Model theory|mathematical construct]], part of an [[axiomatic system]]. There is no necessary connection between coordinate systems and physical motion (or any other aspect of reality). However, coordinate systems can include time as a coordinate, and can be used to describe motion. Thus, [[Lorentz transformation]]s and [[Galilean transformation]]s may be viewed as [[Coordinate system#Transformations|coordinate transformation]]s.

General and specific topics of coordinate systems can be pursued following the [[#See also|See also]] links below.

===Observational frames of reference===
{{main|Inertial frame of reference}}
[[File:Minkowski diagram - 3 systems.svg|thumb|right|256px|Three frames of reference in special relativity. The black frame is at rest. The primed frame moves at 40% of light speed, and the double primed frame at 80%. Note the scissors-like change as speed increases.]]

An '''observational frame of reference''', often referred to as a ''physical frame of reference'', a ''frame of reference'', or simply a ''frame'', is a physical concept related to an [[Observer (special relativity)|observer]] and the observer's state of motion. Here we adopt the view expressed by Kumar and Barve: an observational frame of reference is characterized ''only by its state of motion''.&lt;ref name=Kubar&gt;See {{cite book |author1=Arvind Kumar |author2=Shrish Barve |page=115 |title=How and Why in Basic Mechanics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=czlUPz38MOQC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;dq=%22characterized+only+by+its+state+of+motion%22+inauthor:Kumar|isbn=81-7371-420-7 |year= 2003 |publisher =Orient Longman}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is lack of unanimity on this point. In special relativity, the distinction is sometimes made between an ''observer'' and a ''frame''. According to this view, a ''frame'' is an ''observer'' plus a coordinate lattice constructed to be an orthonormal right-handed set of spacelike vectors perpendicular to a timelike vector. See Doran.&lt;ref name=Doran&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=9780521715959&amp;qt=owc_search |title=Geometric Algebra for Physicists |author1=Chris Doran |author2=Anthony Lasenby |page= §5.2.2, p. 133 |isbn=978-0-521-71595-9 |year=2003 |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This restricted view is not used here, and is not universally adopted even in discussions of relativity.&lt;ref name=Moller&gt;For example, Møller states: "Instead of Cartesian coordinates we can obviously just as well employ general curvilinear coordinates for the fixation of points in physical space.…we shall now introduce general "curvilinear" coordinates ''x''&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; in four-space…." {{cite book |author=C.

|page=211 |isbn=0-8247-1749-X |year=1983 |publisher=CRC Press   }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

There are two types of observational reference frame: [[Inertial frame of reference|inertial]] and [[non-inertial reference frame|non-inertial]]. An inertial frame of reference is defined as one in which all laws of physics take on their simplest form. In [[special relativity]] these frames are related by [[Lorentz transformation]]s, which are parametrized by [[rapidity]]. In Newtonian mechanics, a more restricted definition requires only that [[Newton's first law]] holds true; that is, a Newtonian inertial frame is one in which a [[free particle]] travels in a [[straight line]] at constant [[speed]], or is at rest. These frames are related by [[Galilean transformation]]s. These relativistic and Newtonian transformations are expressed in spaces of general dimension in terms of [[Representation theory|representations]] of the [[Representation theory of the Poincaré group|Poincaré group]] and of the [[Representation theory of the Galilean group|Galilean group]].

In contrast to the inertial frame, a non-inertial frame of reference is one in which [[fictitious force]]s must be invoked to explain observations. An example is an observational frame of reference centered at a point on the Earth's surface. This frame of reference orbits around the center of the Earth, which introduces the fictitious forces known as the [[Coriolis force]], [[centrifugal force]], and [[gravitational force]]. (All of these forces including gravity disappear in a truly inertial reference frame, which is one of free-fall.)

===Measurement apparatus===
A further aspect of a frame of reference is the role of the [[metrology|measurement apparatus]] (for example, clocks and rods) attached to the frame (see Norton quote above). This question is not addressed in this article, and is of particular interest in [[Measurement in quantum mechanics|quantum mechanics]], where the relation between observer and measurement is still under discussion (see [[measurement problem]]).

In physics experiments, the frame of reference in which the laboratory measurement devices are at rest is usually referred to as the [[laboratory frame]] or simply "lab frame." An example would be the frame in which the detectors for a particle accelerator are at rest. The lab frame in some experiments is an inertial frame, but it is not required to be (for example the laboratory on the surface of the Earth in many physics experiments is not inertial). In particle physics experiments, it is often useful to transform energies and momenta of particles from the lab frame where they are measured, to the [[center of momentum frame]] "COM frame" in which calculations are sometimes simplified, since potentially all kinetic energy still present in the COM frame may be used for making new particles.

In this connection it may be noted that the clocks and rods often used to describe observers' measurement equipment in thought, in practice are replaced by a much more complicated and indirect [[metrology]] that is connected to the nature of the [[vacuum]], and uses [[atomic clocks]] that operate according to the [[standard model]] and that must be corrected for [[gravitational time dilation]].&lt;ref name= Wolfson&gt;{{cite book |author=  Richard Wolfson |title=Simply Einstein |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OUJWKdlFKeQC&amp;pg=PA216&amp;dq=%22gravitational+time+dilation+%22|page=216 |isbn=0-393-05154-4 |publisher=W W Norton &amp; Co. |year=2003  }}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[second]], [[meter]] and [[kilogram]]).

In fact, Einstein felt that clocks and rods were merely expedient measuring devices and they should be replaced by more fundamental entities based upon, for example, atoms and molecules.&lt;ref name=Rizzi&gt;See {{cite book |title=Relativity in rotating frames |page=33 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_PGrlCLkkIgC&amp;pg=PA226&amp;dq=centrifugal+%22+%22+relativity+OR+relativistic#PPA33,M1

==Examples of inertial frames of reference==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}

=== Simple example ===
[[File:Two reference frames.PNG|thumb|320px|Figure 1: Two cars moving at different but constant velocities observed from stationary inertial frame ''S'' attached to the road and moving inertial frame ''S′'' attached to the first car.]]
Consider a situation common in everyday life. Two cars travel along a road, both moving at constant velocities. See Figure 1. At some particular moment, they are separated by 200 metres. The car in front is travelling at 22 metres per second and the car behind is travelling at 30 metres per second. If we want to find out how long it will take the second car to catch up with the first, there are three obvious "frames of reference" that we could choose.

First, we could observe the two cars from the side of the road. We define our "frame of reference" ''S'' as follows. We stand on the side of the road and start a stop-clock at the exact moment that the second car passes us, which happens to be when they are a distance ''d'' =  200 m apart. Since neither of the cars is accelerating, we can determine their positions by the following formulas, where &lt;math&gt;x_1(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the position in meters of car one after time ''t'' in seconds and &lt;math&gt;x_2(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the position of car two after time ''t''.

:&lt;math&gt; x_1(t)= d + v_1 t = 200\ + \ 22t\ ; \quad x_2(t)=  v_2 t = 30t &lt;/math&gt;

Notice that these formulas predict at ''t'' = 0 s the first car is 200 m down the road and the second car is right beside us, as expected. We want to find the time at which &lt;math&gt;x_1=x_2&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, we set &lt;math&gt;x_1=x_2&lt;/math&gt; and solve for &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, that is:

:&lt;math&gt;200 + 22 t = 30t \quad&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;8t = 200 \quad&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;t = 25 \quad \mathrm{seconds}&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, we could choose a frame of reference ''S′'' situated in the first car. In this case, the first car is stationary and the second car is approaching from behind at a speed of {{math|1=''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 8 m / s}}. In order to catch up to the first car, it will take a time of {{math|1={{sfrac|''d''|''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} = {{sfrac|200|8}} s}}, that is, 25 seconds, as before. Note how much easier the problem becomes by choosing a suitable frame of reference. The third possible frame of reference would be attached to the second car. That example resembles the case just discussed, except the second car is stationary and the first car moves backward towards it at 8 m / s.

It would have been possible to choose a rotating, accelerating frame of reference, moving in a complicated manner, but this would have served to complicate the problem unnecessarily. It is also necessary to note that one is able to convert measurements made in one coordinate system to another. For example, suppose that your watch is running five minutes fast compared to the local standard time. If you know that this is the case, when somebody asks you what time it is, you are able to deduct five minutes from the time displayed on your watch in order to obtain the correct time. The measurements that an observer makes about a system depend therefore on the observer's frame of reference (you might say that the bus arrived at 5 past three, when in fact it arrived at three).

===Additional example===
[[File:Wikipage pic.PNG|thumb|250px|Figure 2: Simple-minded frame-of-reference example]]
For a simple example involving only the orientation of two observers, consider two people standing, facing each other on either side of a north-south street. See Figure 2. A car drives past them heading south.  For the person facing east, the car was moving towards the right.  However, for the person facing west, the car was moving toward the left.  This discrepancy is because the two people used two different frames of reference from which to investigate this system.

For a more complex example involving observers in relative motion, consider Alfred, who is standing on the side of a road watching a car drive past him from left to right.  In his frame of reference, Alfred defines the spot where he is standing as the origin, the road as the x-axis and the direction in front of him as the positive y-axis.  To him, the car moves along the ''x'' axis with some [[velocity]] ''v'' in the positive x-direction. Alfred's frame of reference is considered an [[inertial frame of reference]] because he is not accelerating (ignoring effects such as Earth's rotation and gravity).

Now consider Betsy, the person driving the car. Betsy, in choosing her frame of reference, defines her location as the origin, the direction to her right as the positive ''x''-axis, and the direction in front of her as the positive ''y''-axis.  In this frame of reference, it is Betsy who is stationary and the world around her that is moving – for instance, as she drives past Alfred, she observes him moving with velocity ''v'' in the negative ''y''-direction.  If she is driving north, then north is the positive ''y''-direction; if she turns east, east becomes the positive ''y''-direction.

Finally, as an example of non-inertial observers, assume Candace is accelerating her car.  As she passes by him, Alfred measures her [[acceleration]] and finds it to be ''a'' in the negative x-direction.  Assuming Candace's acceleration is constant, what acceleration does Betsy measure?  If Betsy's velocity ''v'' is constant, she is in an inertial frame of reference, and she will find the acceleration to be the same as Alfred in her frame of reference, ''a'' in the negative ''y''-direction.  However, if she is accelerating at rate ''A'' in the negative ''y''-direction (in other words, slowing down), she will find Candace's acceleration to be ''a′'' = ''a'' − ''A'' in the negative ''y''-direction - a smaller value than Alfred has measured.  Similarly, if she is accelerating at rate ''A'' in the positive y-direction (speeding up), she will observe Candace's acceleration as ''a′'' = ''a'' + ''A'' in the negative ''y''-direction – a larger value than Alfred's measurement.

Frames of reference are especially important in [[special relativity]], because when a frame of reference is moving at some significant fraction of the speed of light, then the flow of time in that frame does not necessarily apply in another frame. The speed of light is considered to be the only true constant between moving frames of reference.

===Remarks===
{{see also|Special theory of relativity|General theory of relativity}}
It is important to note some assumptions made above about the various inertial frames of reference. Newton, for instance, employed universal time, as explained by the following example. Suppose that you own two clocks, which both tick at exactly the same rate. You synchronize them so that they both display exactly the same time. The two clocks are now separated and one clock is on a fast moving train, traveling at constant velocity towards the other. According to Newton, these two clocks will still tick at the same rate and will both show the same time. Newton says that the rate of time as measured in one frame of reference should be the same as the rate of time in another. That is, there exists a "universal" time and all other times in all other frames of reference will run at the same rate as this universal time irrespective of their position and velocity. This concept of time and simultaneity was later generalized by Einstein in his [[special theory of relativity]] (1905) where he developed transformations between inertial frames of reference based upon the universal nature of physical laws and their economy of expression ([[Lorentz transformations]]).

It is also important to note that the definition of inertial reference frame can be extended beyond three-dimensional Euclidean space. Newton's assumed a Euclidean space, but [[general relativity]] uses a more general geometry. As an example of why this is important, let us consider the [[geometry]] of an ellipsoid. In this geometry, a "free" particle is defined as one at rest or traveling at constant speed on a [[geodesic]] path. Two free particles may begin at the same point on the surface, traveling with the same constant speed in different directions. After a length of time, the two particles collide at the opposite side of the ellipsoid. Both "free" particles traveled with a constant speed, satisfying the definition that  no forces were acting. No acceleration occurred and so Newton's first law held true. This means that the particles were in inertial frames of reference. Since no forces were acting, it was the geometry of the situation which caused the two particles to meet each other again. In a similar way, it is now common to describe&lt;ref name="caveatondescription"&gt;That is, both descriptions are equivalent and can be used as needed.  This equivalence does not hold outside of general relativity, e.g., in [[entropic gravity]].&lt;/ref&gt; that we exist in a four-dimensional geometry known as [[spacetime]]. In this picture, the curvature of this 4D space is responsible for the way in which two bodies with mass are drawn together even if no forces are acting. This curvature of spacetime replaces the force known as gravity in Newtonian mechanics and special relativity.

==Non-inertial frames==
{{main|Fictitious force|Non-inertial frame|Rotating frame of reference}}
Here the relation between inertial and non-inertial observational frames of reference is considered. The basic difference between these frames is the need in non-inertial frames for fictitious forces, as described below.

An accelerated frame of reference is often delineated as being the "primed" frame, and all variables that are dependent on that frame are notated with primes, e.g. ''x′'', ''y′'', ''a′''.

The vector from the origin of an inertial reference frame to the origin of an accelerated reference frame is commonly notated as  '''R'''.  Given a point of interest that exists in both frames, the vector from the inertial origin to the point is called '''r''', and the vector from the accelerated origin to the point is called '''r′'''.
From the geometry of the situation, we get
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf r = \mathbf R + \mathbf r'&lt;/math&gt;
Taking the first and second derivatives of this with respect to time, we obtain
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf v = \mathbf V + \mathbf v'&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf a = \mathbf A + \mathbf a'&lt;/math&gt;
where '''V''' and '''A''' are the velocity and acceleration of the accelerated system with respect to the inertial system  and '''v''' and '''a''' are the velocity and acceleration of the point of interest with respect to the inertial frame.

These equations allow transformations between the two coordinate systems; for example, we can now write [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton.27s second law|Newton's second law]] as
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F = m\mathbf a = m\mathbf A + m\mathbf a'&lt;/math&gt;

When there is accelerated motion due to a force being exerted there is manifestation of inertia. If an electric car designed to recharge its battery system when decelerating is switched to braking, the batteries are recharged, illustrating the physical strength of manifestation of inertia. However, the manifestation of inertia does not prevent acceleration (or deceleration), for manifestation of inertia occurs in response to change in velocity due to a force. Seen from the perspective of a rotating frame of reference the manifestation of inertia appears to exert a force (either in [[centrifugal force (rotating reference frame)|centrifugal]] direction, or in a direction orthogonal to an object's motion, the [[Coriolis effect]]).

A common sort of accelerated reference frame is a frame that is both rotating and translating (an example is a frame of reference attached to a CD which is playing while the player is carried). This arrangement leads to the equation (see [[Fictitious force]] for a derivation):

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf a = \mathbf a' + \dot{\boldsymbol\omega} \times \mathbf r' + 2\boldsymbol\omega \times \mathbf v' + \boldsymbol\omega \times (\boldsymbol\omega \times \mathbf r') + \mathbf A_0&lt;/math&gt;

or, to solve for the acceleration in the accelerated frame,

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf a' = \mathbf a - \dot{\boldsymbol\omega} \times \mathbf r' - 2\boldsymbol\omega \times \mathbf v' - \boldsymbol\omega \times (\boldsymbol\omega \times \mathbf r') - \mathbf A_0&lt;/math&gt;

Multiplying through by the mass ''m'' gives
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F' = \mathbf F_\mathrm{physical} + \mathbf F'_\mathrm{Euler} + \mathbf F'_\mathrm{Coriolis} + \mathbf F'_\mathrm{centripetal} - m\mathbf A_0&lt;/math&gt;
where
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F'_\mathrm{Euler} = -m\dot{\boldsymbol\omega} \times \mathbf r'&lt;/math&gt; ([[Euler force]])

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F'_\mathrm{Coriolis} = -2m\boldsymbol\omega \times \mathbf v'&lt;/math&gt;  ([[Coriolis force]])

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F'_\mathrm{centrifugal} = -m\boldsymbol\omega \times (\boldsymbol\omega \times \mathbf r')=m(\omega^2 \mathbf r'- (\boldsymbol\omega \cdot \mathbf r')\boldsymbol\omega) &lt;/math&gt;  ([[centrifugal force (rotating reference frame)|centrifugal force]])

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7461">A '''GPS watch''' is a device with integrated [[GPS navigation device|GPS receiver]] that is worn as a single unit strapped onto a wrist, in the manner of a [[bracelet]]. The watch can have other features and capabilities depending on its intended purpose and be a [[smartwatch]]. [[GPS]] watches are most often used for sports and fitness purposes. Many can connect to external sensors by the wireless [[ANT+]] protocol, and/or to a computer by [[USB]] to transfer data and configuration. Common sensors used are heart rate monitors and footpods (running cadence and speed sensor). A [[Inertial footpod|footpod]] can be used to supplement or replace GPS data, such as providing treadmill speed and distance for the watch to log and share. [[USB charger|Recharging by USB]] is commonplace.

== Optional features ==
* Display (Illuminated or passive)
* Time display
* Speed/pace display
* Map display
* Routes
* [[GPS tracking unit|Route tracking]]
* [[Heart rate monitor]] compatibility
* Running cadence and speed sensor ([[Inertial footpod|footpod]]) compatibility
* [[Cadence (cycling)|Cycling cadence]] sensor compatibility
* Cycling power meter compatibility
* Weight scale compatibility
* Compatibility with sport transitions (such as [[triathlon]]s)
* Training programs (such as intervals)
* Computer connection for logging, mapping and sharing data
* Hydration/nutrition reminders
* Reminder alarms to alternate between [[running]] and [[walking]]
* Accelerometer for tracking indoor swimming
* Touchscreen
* Larger add-on rechargeable battery for longer events ([[marathon]], etc.)

== Purpose ==
A [[GPS]] watch is commonly a sport watch (a device used for sports and exercise in general rather than just GPS functionally). It may be designed for one particular sport or other purpose, or provide modes and features to suit several.

Examples of common purposes:

* [[Data logger|Data logging]]
* Navigation
* [[Fitness training]] (Many watches can be used for many sports such as running, walking, hiking, cycling or swimming)
* Specific sport assistance (such as [[golf]])
* Locating children and adults with intellectual disabilities that are at risk of wandering or elopement.

==[[Inertial footpod|Accelerometer]]-only==
These devices offer similar functions to GPS watches,
but measure speed and distance using a motion sensor (built-in, or a [[Inertial footpod|footpod]] attached to a shoe), instead of GPS.
Since they do not rely on GPS, they can work indoors, but do not track location data for mapping. Certain models include [[heart rate monitor]]ing, either built-in or through a chest-worn sensor. There are also a wide variety of watches that measure only [[Heart rate monitor|heart rate]] and time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1538">In [[data analysis]] involving geographical locations, '''geo-imputation''' or '''geographical imputation''' methods are steps taken to replace [[missing value]]s for exact locations with approximate locations derived from associated data. They assign a reasonable location or geographic based attribute  (e.g., [[census tract]]) to a person by using both the demographic characteristics of the person
and the population characteristics from a larger geographic aggregate area in which the person was geocoded (e.g., postal delivery area or county). For example if a person's census tract was known and no other address information was available then geo-imputation methods could be used to probabilistically assign that person to a smaller geographic area, such as a census block group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Henry, Kevin A., Boscoe, Francis P.,|title=Estimating the accuracy of geographical imputation|journal=International Journal of Health Geographics|year=2008 |volume=7 |issue=3 |doi=10.1186/1476-072X-7-3|pmid=18215308|pages=3|pmc=2266732}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''geo URI scheme''' is a [[Uniform Resource Identifier]] (URI) scheme defined by the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]]'s RFC 5870 (published 8 June 2010)&lt;ref name="RFC5870"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5870|title=RFC 5870 - A Uniform Resource Identifier for Geographic Locations (geo URI)|date=2010-06-08|publisher=Internet Engineering Task Force|accessdate=9 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for geographic locations using the 'geo' [[URI scheme|scheme name]].  A 'geo' URI identifies a physical location in a two- or three-dimensional [[Spatial referencing system|coordinate reference system]] in a compact, simple, human-readable, and [[Communications protocol|protocol]]-independent way.&lt;ref name="RFC5870" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The current revision of the [[vCard]] specification&lt;ref name="RFC6350"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6350|title=RFC 6350 - vCard Format Specification|date=2011-08-11|publisher=Internet Engineering Task Force|accessdate=19 Jun 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; supports geo URIs in a vCard's "GEO" property, and the [[GeoSMS]] standard uses geo URIs for [[geotagging]] SMS messages. [[Android (operating system)|Android]] based devices support geo URIs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://developer.android.com/guide/appendix/g-app-intents.html|title=Android Intents List|publisher=google.com|date=|accessdate=2012-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; although that implementation is based on a draft revision of the specification, and supports a different set of URI parameters and query strings.

A geo URI is not to be confused with the site GeoUrl&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geourl.org/ |title=Geourl.org |publisher=Geourl.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227152230/http://geourl.org/ |archivedate=2011-12-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (which implements [[ICBM address]]).

==Example ==

A simple geo URI might look like:

:&lt;code&gt;geo:37.786971,-122.399677&lt;/code&gt;

where the two numerical values represent [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] respectively,&lt;ref name="RFC5870" /&gt; and are separated by a [[comma]].&lt;ref name="RFC5870" /&gt; They are coordinates of an [[Horizontal position representation|horizontal grid]] (2D). If a third comma-separated value is present, it represents [[altitude]];&lt;ref name="RFC5870" /&gt; so, coordinates of a 3D  grid.  Coordinates in the Southern and Western hemispheres as well as altitudes below the coordinate reference system (depths) are signed negative with a leading dash.&lt;ref name="RFC5870" /&gt; 

The geo URI also allows for an optional "uncertainty" value, separated by a [[semicolon]], representing the uncertainty of the location in meters, and is described using the "u" URI parameter.&lt;ref name="RFC5870" /&gt; A geo URI with an uncertainty parameter looks as follows:

:&lt;code&gt;geo:37.786971,-122.399677;u=35&lt;/code&gt;

A geo URI may, for example, be included on a web page, as [[HTML]]:

:&lt;code&gt;&lt;a href="geo:37.786971,-122.399677;u=35"&gt;Wikimedia Headquarters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

so that a geo URI-aware [[user agent]] such as a [[web browser]] could launch the user's chosen mapping service; or it could be used in an [[Atom (standard)|Atom]] feed or other [[XML]] file.

== Coordinate reference systems ==

The values of the coordinates only make sense when a [[coordinate reference system]] (CRS) is specified. The default CRS is the [[World Geodetic System|World Geodetic System 1984]] (WGS-84),&lt;ref name="RFC5870" /&gt; and it is not recommended to use any other:

{{quote| The optional 'crs' URI parameter described below may be used by future specifications to define the use of CRSes other than WGS-84. This is primarily intended to cope with the case of another CRS  replacing WGS-84 as the predominantly used one, rather than allowing the arbitrary use of thousands of CRSes for the URI (which would clearly affect interoperability).&lt;ref name="RFC5870" /&gt;
}}

The only justified use of other CRS today is, perhaps, to preserve projection in [[Scale_(map)#Large-scale_maps_with_curvature_neglected|large-scale maps]], as local [[Universal_Transverse_Mercator_coordinate_system|UTM]], or for non-terrestrial coordinates such as those on [[Moon|the Moon]] or [[Mars]].  The syntax and semantic of the CRS parameter, separated by a semicolon, is described at section 8.3 of RFC&amp;nbsp;5870. Examples:

* The [[Washington Monument]]'s location  expressed with [[Universal_Transverse_Mercator_coordinate_system#UTM_zone|UTM-zone 18S]] and its [http://www.spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/wgs-84-utm-zone-18s/ standard ID]:
*: &lt;code&gt;geo:323482,4306480;crs=EPSG:32718;u=20&lt;/code&gt;
* A geo URI for a hypothetical lunar CRS created in 2011 might be:
*: &lt;code&gt;geo:37.786971,-122.399677;crs=Moon-2011;u=35&lt;/code&gt;

The order in which the semicolon-separated parameters occur is partially significant.&lt;ref name="RFC5870" /&gt; Whilst the labeltext parameter and future parameters may be given in any order, the &lt;code&gt;crs&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt; parameters must come first. If both are used, the &lt;code&gt;crs&lt;/code&gt; must precede the &lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref name="RFC5870" /&gt; All parameters are [[Case sensitivity|case-insensitive]],&lt;ref name="RFC5870" /&gt; so, imagining a future new parameter &lt;code&gt;mapcolors&lt;/code&gt;, it can be ignored by simpler applications, and the above example is exactly equivalent to:
: &lt;code&gt;geo:323482,4306480;CRS=epsg:32718;U=20;mapcolors=for_daltonic&lt;/code&gt;
Being in doubt, remember that use of the lowercase representation of parameter names (&lt;code&gt;crs&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;mapcolors&lt;/code&gt;) is preferred.

The '''Geographic Information Science and Technology Body of Knowledge''' ('''GISTBoK''') is a reference document produced by the [[University Consortium for Geographic Information Science]] (UCGIS) as the first product of its Model Curricula project, started in 1997 by [[Duane Marble]] and a select task force, and completed in 2006 by [[David DiBiase]] and a team of editors.

The ''GISTBoK'' is the most successful effort to date to create a comprehensive outline of the concepts and skills unique to the geospatial realm, including [[geographic information systems]], [[geographic information science]], [[remote sensing]], [[satellite navigation systems]], and [[cartography]].  However, it is missing some topics, such as [[geocoding]], and has significant granularity issues: large, mature subfields such as [[surveying]], [[GPS]], and [[remote sensing]] are covered in small sections, while the relatively immature field of [[geocomputation]] is granted an entire knowledge area.  There is also opposition to the document as a whole, especially from the [[critical GIS]] community, on the grounds that the discipline is too diverse and too subjective to be so easily encapsulated.  The editors have acknowledged these shortcomings, and have expressed hope that wider input on future editions will solve some of these issues.

The ''GISTBoK'' is intended to be used in a variety of applications, including curriculum design, educational assessment, educational program accreditation, professional certification, hiring practices, and project RFP's.  All of these activities are elements of the current trend toward regulation and standardization of the geospatial professions, and much of the opposition to the ''Body of Knowledge'' comes from those opposed to this trend, especially in academia, who feel that GIS&amp;T is too diverse, interdisciplinary, and subjective to be regulated.  One counterargument to this opposition is that the body of knowledge approach enables a flexible form of regulation that accommodates a diversity of skills and viewpoints.

The ''GISTBoK'' is patterned after the [[Computing Curricula]] project of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acm.org/education/curricula-recommendations]&lt;/ref&gt; and other model curriculum projects.  It is essentially a hierarchical outline, composed of Knowledge Areas, broken down into Units, further divided into Topics.  Each topic includes a list of 5–10 educational objectives that exemplify a person with varying levels of knowledge and skill. It does ''not'' include an encyclopaedic description of each topic.

The first edition was co-sponsored by UCGIS and several major vendors ([[Environmental Systems Research Institute|ESRI]], [[Intergraph]], and GE [[Smallworld]]), and was published in August 2006 by the [[Association of American Geographers]].

'''Geoinformatics''' is the science and the technology which develops and uses [[information science]] infrastructure to address the problems of [[geography]], [[cartography]], [[geosciences]] and related branches of science and engineering.

==Overview==

Geoinformatics has been described as "the science and technology dealing with the structure and character of spatial information, its capture, its classification and qualification, its storage, processing, portrayal and dissemination, including the infrastructure necessary to secure optimal use of this information"&lt;ref&gt;P.L.N. Raju, Fundamentals of Geographic Information Systems&lt;/ref&gt; or "the art, science or technology dealing with the acquisition, storage, processing production, presentation and dissemination of geoinformation".&lt;ref&gt;M. Ehlers (2008) Geoinformatics and digital earth initiatives: a German perspective, International Journal of Digital Earth, 1:1, 17-30, DOI: 10.1080/17538940701781975&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Geomatics]] is a similarly used term which encompasses geoinformatics, but geomatics focuses more so on [[surveying]]. Geoinformatics has at its core the technologies supporting the processes of acquiring, analyzing and visualizing spatial data. Both geomatics and geoinformatics include and rely heavily upon the theory and practical implications of [[geodesy]].

Geography and earth science increasingly rely on digital spatial data acquired from remotely sensed images analyzed by [[geographical information systems]] (GIS) and visualized on paper or the computer screen.&lt;ref&gt;Bouloucos and Brown, ITC Courses in Remote Sensing, GIS and Photogrammetry&lt;/ref&gt;

Geoinformatics combines geospatial analysis and modeling, development of geospatial databases, information systems design, human-computer interaction and both wired and wireless networking technologies. Geoinformatics uses [[geocomputation]] and [[geovisualization]] for analyzing [[geoinformation]].

Branches of geoinformatics include:

==Research==

Research in this field is used to support global and local environmental, energy and security programs. The Geographic Information Science and Technology group of [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] is supported by various government departments and agencies including the [[United States Department of Energy]]. It is currently the only group in the [[United States Department of Energy National Laboratories|United States Department of Energy National Laboratory System]] to focus on advanced theory and application research in this field. There are also a lot of interdiscipline research involved in geoinformatics fields including computer science, information technology, software engineering, biogeography, geography, conservation, architecture, spatial analysis and reinformacement learning.

==Applications==

Many fields benefit from geoinformatics, including urban planning and land use management, in-car navigation systems, virtual globes, public health, local and national gazetteer management, environmental modeling and analysis, military, transport network planning and management, agriculture, meteorology and climate change, oceanography and coupled ocean and atmosphere modelling, business location planning, architecture and archeological reconstruction, telecommunications, criminology and crime simulation, aviation, biodiversity conservation and maritime transport.
The importance of the spatial dimension in assessing, monitoring and modelling various issues and problems related to sustainable management of natural resources is recognized all over the world. Geoinformatics becomes very important technology to decision-makers across a wide range of disciplines, industries, commercial sector, environmental agencies, local and national government, research, and academia, national survey and mapping organisations, International organisations, United Nations, emergency services, public health and epidemiology, crime mapping, transportation and infrastructure, information technology industries, GIS consulting firms, environmental management agencies), tourist industry, utility companies, market analysis and e-commerce, mineral exploration, etc. Many government and non government agencies started to use spatial data for managing their day-to-day activities.

A '''position representation''' is the parameters used to express a position relative to a reference. Representing position in three dimensions is often done by a [[Euclidean vector]]. However, when representing position relative to the [[Earth]] it is often more convenient to represent vertical position as [[altitude]] or depth, and to use some other parameters to represent '''horizontal position'''. There are also several applications where only the horizontal position is of interest, this might e.g. be the case for ships and ground vehicles/cars.

There are several options for horizontal position representations, each with different properties which makes them appropriate for different applications. [[Latitude]]/[[longitude]] and [[Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system|UTM]] are common horizontal position representations.

The horizontal position has two [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]], and thus two parameters are sufficient to uniquely describe such a position. However, similarly to the use of [[Euler angles]] as a [[Rotation formalisms in three dimensions|formalism for representing rotations]], using only the minimum number of parameters gives [[mathematical singularity|singularities]], and thus three parameters are required for the horizontal position to avoid this.

==Latitude and longitude==
{{Main|Latitude|Longitude}}

The most common horizontal position representation is [[latitude]] and [[longitude]]. The parameters are intuitive and well known, and are thus suited for communicating a position to humans, e.g. using a position plot.

However, latitude and longitude should be used with care in mathematical expressions (including calculations in computer programs). The main reason is the [[mathematical singularity|singularities]] at the [[Geographical pole|Poles]], which makes longitude undefined at these points. Also near the poles the latitude/longitude grid is highly non-linear, and several errors may occur in calculations that are sufficiently accurate on other locations.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Gade |first1= Kenneth |year= 2010 |title= A non-singular horizontal position representation |journal= The Journal of Navigation |publisher= Cambridge University Press |volume= 63 |issue= 3 |pages=395–417 |url=http://www.navlab.net/Publications/A_Nonsingular_Horizontal_Position_Representation.pdf| format=PDF |doi= 10.1017/S0373463309990415 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another problematic area is the [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]] at ±[[180th meridian|180°]] longitude, where the longitude has a [[Discontinuity (mathematics)|discontinuity]], and hence specific program code must often be written to handle this. An example of the consequences of omitting such code is the crash of the navigation systems of twelve [[F-22 Raptor]] fighter aircraft while crossing this meridian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.itnews.com.au/News/74081,stealth-fighters-hit-by-software-crash.aspx |title=Stealth fighters hit by software crash |date=27 February 2007 |accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''n''-vector==
{{Main|n-vector}}

[[n-vector|''n''-vector]] is a three parameter [[mathematical singularity|non-singular]] horizontal position representation that can replace latitude and longitude. Geometrically, it is a [[unit vector]] which is normal to the [[reference ellipsoid]]. The vector is [[Vector decomposition|decomposed]] in an [[ECEF|Earth centered earth fixed]] [[coordinate system]]. It behaves the same at all Earth positions, and it holds the mathematical [[Injective function|one-to-one]] property. The vector formulation makes it possible to use standard 3D [[Vector calculus|vector algebra]], and thus ''n''-vector is well-suited for mathematical calculations, e.g. adding, subtracting, interpolating and averaging positions.

Using three parameters, ''n''-vector is inconvenient for communicating a position directly to humans and before showing a position plot, a [[n-vector#Converting n-vector to latitude/longitude|conversion to latitude/longitude]] might be needed.

==Local flat Earth assumption==
When carrying out several calculations within a limited area, a [[Cartesian coordinate system]] might be defined with the [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]] at a specified Earth-fixed position. The origin is often selected at the surface of the reference ellipsoid, with the ''z''-axis in the vertical direction. Hence (three dimensional) position vectors relative to this coordinate frame will have two horizontal and one vertical parameter. The axes are typically selected as [[North East Down|North-East-Down]] or [[East North Up|East-North-Up]], and thus this system can be viewed as a [[linearization]] of the [[Meridian (geography)|meridians]] and [[Circle of latitude|parallels]].

For small areas a local coordinate system can be convenient for relative positioning, but with increasing (horizontal) distances, errors will increase and repositioning of the [[tangent point]] may be required. The alignment along the north and east directions is not possible at the [[Geographical pole|Poles]], and near the Poles these directions might have significant errors (here the linearization is valid only in a very small area).

==UTM==
{{Main| Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system}}
Instead of one local Cartesian grid, that needs to be repositioned as the position of interest moves, a fixed set of [[map projections]] covering the Earth can be defined. [[Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system|UTM]] is one such system, dividing the Earth into 60 longitude zones (and with [[Universal Polar Stereographic coordinate system|UPS]] covering the [[Polar regions]]).

UTM is widely used, and the coordinates approximately corresponds to meters north and east. However, as a set of map-projections it has inherent [[distortions]], and thus most calculations based on UTM will not be exact. The crossing of zones gives additional complexity.

==Comparison==
When deciding which parameters to use for representing position in a specific application, there are several properties that should be considered. The following table gives a summary of what to consider.

'''Ice navigation''' is a specialist area of [[navigation]] involving the use of maritime skills to determine and monitor the position of [[ships]] in cold waters, where [[ice]] is a hazard to the safety of navigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Ice Navigation |author=Norvald Kjerstad |publisher=Tapir Academic |year=2011 |isbn=9788251927604}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of [[sea ice]] requires a ship to exercise caution, for example by avoiding [[icebergs]], slowly sailing through a [[Lead (sea ice)|lead]], or by working with an [[icebreaker]] to follow a course through the ice to a destination.&lt;ref&gt;''The Ice Navigation Manual'', [[Witherby Publishing Group]], p. 229–327&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally ships must also deal with the extreme cold of the climate in regions such as the [[Polar regions of Earth|poles]]; this involves removal of ice accumulation from the ship, as well as protecting the [[Sailor|crew]] from the elements while working on the deck.&lt;ref&gt;''The Ice Navigation Manual'', [[Witherby Publishing Group]], p. 201–226&lt;/ref&gt; Ships and their crews operating in ice will follow established rules of [[seamanship]], as well as complying with national and international regulations such as the [[Polar Code]].

==Areas of ice navigation==
Ice navigation occurs wherever a waterborne vessel transits through [[sea ice]]. One of the more common regions for ice navigation is the [[Baltic Sea]], where vessels visiting the [[Baltic States]] will make their way through [[first year ice]] in the [[winter]] months, often with an [[Icebreaker]], or with ice reports, charts and data provided by meteorological offices.&lt;ref name="Gard"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gard.no/web/publications/content?p_document_id=20650989 |title=Ice Navigation |publisher=[[Assuranceforeningen Gard|GARD]] |access-date=July 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baltic1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://baltice.org/weather/ |title=Ice Navigation |publisher=BALTICE |access-date=July 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other areas include the [[Arctic Ocean]], where increasing numbers of ships are transiting the region in the summer months for [[cruising (maritime)|cruising]] and to transport cargo, as a result of [[oil]] and [[gas]] extraction in areas such as [[Yamal LNG|Yamal]].&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/23/climate/ships-in-the-arctic.html |title=With More Ships in the Arctic, Fears of Disaster Rise |publisher=[[New York Times]] |access-date=July 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problems of increased shipping in [[Polar region|polar]] regions presents additional challenges, including maritime safety concerns in the event that ice navigation is not carried out carefully.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; Ships will also pass through ice when navigating in the [[Antarctic]], although most ships are either [[research vessel]]s or [[cruise ship]]s that have been especially ice strengthened. Other significant maritime regions where ships will navigate through Ice include the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]], around [[Greenland]] and the Canadian coast, the [[North Atlantic]] during iceberg season and through the [[Northwest Passage]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Ice Navigation Manual'', [[Witherby Publishing Group]], p. 49–108&lt;/ref&gt;

== Icing of superstructure ==

The accumulation of ice on the [[superstructure]] is a dangerous phenomenon. When the temperature is below {{convert|-2.2|C|F}} slight icing will occur at winds of 5 Bft, moderate icing at 7 Bft, and severe icing at 8 Bft. When sailing in fresh water, icing will occur from {{convert|0|C|F}} and below. The more common causes of ice formation on the superstructure are from spray by wave crests and ship-generated spray. Other possibilities are snow fall, sea fog, a drastic fall in ambient temperature and also freezing raindrops in contact with the cold steel. The heading of the vessel relative to the wind and seas will determine which parts of the superstructure will ice first. Icing can immobilise equipment such as anchors or cause a dangerous list if the windward side of the vessel ices more heavily.

== Ice detection by radar ==

A [[radar]] can be useful in detecting ice, but the returning signal which bounces off ice (even icebergs) is very faint, much lower than from ships. Conventional marine radars are designed for target detection and avoidance. Enhanced marine radars provide a higher definition image of the ice that the vessel is transmitting and will result in a much clearer image. This image can be used to identify the quantity and sort of ice that has to be dealt with. In standard radar, sea clutter affects the ability to see in the near vicinity of the vessel. An X-band radar set to a short pulse can give improved results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=http://www.ccg-gcc.gc.ca/Icebreaking/Ice-Navigation-Canadian-Waters/Navigation-in-ice-covered-waters|title=Ice Navigation in Canadian Waters |chapter=Chapter 4: Navigation in Ice Covered Waters|publisher=Government of Canada, Fisheries and Oceans|author=Canadian Coast Guard|date=2013-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Heritage nomination is representative for the processes that shaped the continent during the [[High Middle Ages]] between 1000 and 1300: [[Christianization]], the so-called “[[Landesausbau]]”  and the dynamics of cultural exchange and transfer characteristic for this very period.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO (2017): WHC/17/41.COM/INF.8B1.{{cite book|title=Nominations to the World Heritage List (Krakow, 2017).|publisher= UNESCO press|page=54|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/sessions/41com/|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bartlett"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bartlett|first=Robert|title=The Making of Europe: Conquest, Colonization and Cultural Change 950-1350|date=1994|publisher=Penguin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lanscape around Neuenburg.jpg|thumb|Landscape around Neuenburg]]

== World Heritage Nomination ==
The castle of Kleinjena is one of the eleven components of the cultural landscape [[Naumburg Cathedral and the High Medieval Cultural Landscape of the Rivers Saale and Unstrut]]. As Kleinjena marks the starting point for the vast growth of the region in the [[12th century]], it is indispensable for an understanding of the history of this [[cultural landscape]] as a whole.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The Förderverein Welterbe an Saale und Unstrut e.V. is the coordinating body for this nomination: http://www.naumburg-cathedral.de/.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The castle of Kleinjena was built by the influential [[Ekkehard]]ine dynasty. This dynasty owned estates in the old settlement area in the northern part of [[Thuringia]] and in the area of the conﬂuence of the rivers [[Saale]] and [[Unstrut]]. The family seat was the castle of Gene, which was situated south of the Unstrut River in the former diocese of the [[Archbishopric of Mainz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Die Ekkehardiner, Markgrafen von Meißen und ihre Beziehungen zum Reich und zu den Piasten (= Europäische Hochschulschriften. Reihe 3: Geschichte und ihre Hilfswissenschaften. Bd. 691).|trans-title=The Ekkerhardines, margraves of Meißen and their relations in the empire (European university publications. Number 3: History and related sciences. Bd. 691.|author=Rupp, Gabriele|publisher=Lang|date=1996|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like other [[Ottonian]] [[palace]]s or imperial [[castles]] of the time, the castle complex of Ekkehard I was a segmented complex with two ramparts on a ﬂat spur. Its main rampart and the related trench have ﬂattened to a great extent, but they are still clearly visible in the terrain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mitteldeutsche Geschichte. Sachsen - Sachsen-Anhalt - Thüringen.|trans-title=Central German history. Saxony - Saxony-Anhalt-Thuringia|author=Raßloff, Steffen|publisher=Edition Leipzig|date=2016|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the murder of [[Ekkehard I]], the site was gradually abandoned as the margravial brothers Hermann and Ekkehard II transferred their family seatfrom Kleinjena to Naumburg (Nuenburch), first mentioned in the records in 1012.

[[File:Certificate Emperor Conrad.tif|thumb|Certificate Emperor Conrad]]
Encouraged by a privilege granted by [[Emperor Conrad II]] in 1033, also the merchants of Kleinjena moved to Naumburg, since they were guaranteed free trade and the heritable, interest-free ownership of their enclosed domicile. The comparative advantage of Naumburg was also a topographical one as that the descent of the long-distance routes coming from the plateau was not as steep as in Kleinjena and Grossjena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Geschichte Thüringens|trans-title=History of Thuringia|pages=15–79|author=Raßloff, Steffen|publisher=Beck|date=2010|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Today ==
These archeologically documented remains of the [[castle]] of the [[Margraves of Meissen|Markgraves of Meißen]], the Ekkehardines, date back to the [[10th century]].  At the European level, these preserved structures are an early evidence of the efforts undertaken by the high nobility to impose its centre of power through large-scale fortifications that eventually served as their memorials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Die Burgen der Ekkehardinger an der Unstrutmündung(1.

'''Long Range Kinematic (LRK)''' technology is a sophisticated kinematic method developed by Magellan (formerly Thales) Navigation that optimises the advantages of dual-frequency [[GPS]] operation. Other conventional methods use the dual-frequency only during initialisation. LRK makes solving ambiguities during initialisation easy and continuous dual-frequency kinematic operation possible at distances up to 40 kilometres.

Conventional dual-frequency kinematic operation is limited to about 10 kilometres, using a combined observation on GPS L1 and L2 frequencies to produce an initial wide lane solution, ambiguous to around 86 centimetres. During a second phase, the conventional kinematic method uses measurements from the L1 frequency only. This method only allows for kinematic operation as long as the de-correlation of atmospheric errors is compatible with a pure phase single-frequency solution.

Similar to the [[Kinematic Applications in Real Time|KART]] process, LRK is a simple and reliable method that allows any initialisation mode, from a static or fixed reference point, to On The Fly ambiguity resolution, when performing dual-frequency GPS positioning. LRK technology reduces initialisation times to a few seconds by efficiently using L2 measurements in every mode of operation. LRK maintains optimal real-time positioning accuracy to within a centimetre at a range up to 40-50 kilometres, even with a reduced number of visible satellites.

'''Land systems''' constitute the terrestrial component of the Earth system and encompass all processes and activities related to the human use of land, including socioeconomic, technological and organizational investments and arrangements, as well as the benefits gained from land and the unintended social and ecological outcomes of societal activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Verburg|first=Peter H|last2=Erb|first2=Karl-Heinz|last3=Mertz|first3=Ole|last4=Espindola|first4=Giovana|date=2013-10-01|title=Land System Science: between global challenges and local realities|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877343513000936|journal=Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability|series=Human settlements and industrial systems|volume=5|issue=5|pages=433–437|doi=10.1016/j.cosust.2013.08.001|pmc=4018982|pmid=24851141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes  in land systems have large consequences for the local environment and human well-being and are at the same time pervasive factors of global environmental change. Land provides vital resources to society, such as food, fuel, fibres and many other [[ecosystem services]] that support production functions, regulate risks of natural hazards, or provide cultural and spiritual services.  By using the land, society alters and modifies the quantity and quality of the provision of these services.

Land system changes are the direct result of human decision making at multiple scales ranging from local land owners decisions to national scale land use planning and global trade agreements. The aggregate impact of many local land system changes has far reaching consequences for the Earth System, that feedback on ecosystem services, human well-being and decision making.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crossman|first=Neville D|last2=Bryan|first2=Brett A|last3=de Groot|first3=Rudolf S|last4=Lin|first4=Yu-Pin|last5=Minang|first5=Peter A|date=2013-10-01|title=Land science contributions to ecosystem services|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877343513000729|journal=Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability|series=Human settlements and industrial systems|volume=5|issue=5|pages=509–514|doi=10.1016/j.cosust.2013.06.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, land system change is both a cause and consequence of socio-ecological processes.

The Global Land Programme (GLP) of [[Future Earth]] is an interdisciplinary community of science and practice fostering the study of land systems and the co-design of solutions for global sustainability.

[[File:Anonymous The Noord-Nieuwland in Table Bay, 1762.jpg|thumb|right|300px|An 18th-century painting of a [[Dutch East Indies Company|VOC]] ship with [[Table Mountain]] in the background, used by navigators as the landmark to sail around [[Cape of Good Hope|southern tip of Africa]].]]

A '''landmark''' is a recognizable natural or artificial feature used for [[navigation]], a feature that stands out from its near environment and is often visible from long distances.

In modern use, the term can also be applied to smaller structures or features, that have become local or [[national symbol]]s.

==Etymology==
[[File:Welcome to the land of freedom.png|thumb|right|The [[Statue of Liberty]], a famous landmark of [[New York City]] and [[United States]], greets the newly arrived immigrants, located near [[Ellis Island]] where millions of immigrants first touched U.S. soil.]]
In old English the word ''landmearc'' (from ''land'' + ''mearc'' (mark)) was used to describe an "object set up to mark the boundaries of a kingdom, estate, etc.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=landmark |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |website=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2016-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting from approx. 1560, this understanding of landmark was replaced by a more general one. A landmark became a "conspicuous object in a landscape".
A ''landmark'' literally meant a [[geographic feature]] used by [[exploration|explorers]] and others to find their way back or through an area.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} For example, the [[Table Mountain]] near [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]] is used as the landmark to help sailors to navigate around southern tip of [[Africa]] during the [[Age of Exploration]]. Artificial structures are also sometimes built to assist sailors in naval navigation. The [[Lighthouse of Alexandria]] and [[Colossus of Rhodes]] are ancient structures built to lead ships to the port.

In modern usage, a landmark includes anything that is easily recognizable, such as a [[monument]], [[building]], or other [[structure]]. In [[American English]] it is the main term used to designate places that might be of interest to [[tourist]]s due to notable physical features or historical significance. Landmarks in the [[British English]] sense are often used for casual [[navigation]], such as giving directions. This is done in American English as well.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

In [[urban studies]] as well as in [[geography]], a landmark is furthermore defined as an external point of reference that helps orienting in a familiar or unfamiliar environment.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, Kevin. "The image of the city". [[MIT Press]], 1960, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Landmarks are often used in verbal route instructions and as such an object of study by [[linguist]]s as well as in other fields of study.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

==Types==
[[File:Tour Eiffel Wikimedia Commons.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Eiffel Tower]] - tallest in the world from 1889 to 1930 and a famous [[Paris]] landmark]]
Landmarks are usually classified as either natural landmarks or man-made landmarks, both are originally used to support navigation on finding directions. A variant is a ''[[seamark]]'' or ''[[daymark]]'', a structure usually built intentionally to aid sailors navigating featureless coasts.

===Natural===
Natural landmarks can be characteristic features, such as [[mountain]]s or [[plateau]]s. Examples of natural landmarks are Table Mountain in South Africa, [[Mount Ararat]] in Turkey, [[Uluru]] in Australia, [[Mount Fuji]] in Japan and [[Grand Canyon]] in the United States. Trees might also serve as local landmarks, such as jubilee oaks or [[conifer]]s. Some landmark trees may be nicknamed, examples being ''Queen's Oak'', ''Hanging Oak'' or ''Centennial Tree''.

===Human made===
In modern sense, landmarks are usually referred to as [[monument]]s or prominent distinctive buildings, used as the symbol of a certain area, city, or [[National symbol|nation]], such as the [[Statue of Unity]] in [[Narmada District | Narmada]] ,[[White House]] in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington (D.C.)]], [[Statue of Liberty]] in [[New York City]], [[Eiffel Tower]] in [[Paris]] , [[Colosseum]] in [[Rome]], [[Big Ben]] in [[London]], [[Christ the Redeemer (statue)|Christ the Redeemer]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Bratislava Castle]] in [[Bratislava]], [[Space Needle]] in [[Seattle]],   [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] or the [[Sydney Opera House]] both in [[Sydney]], [[Brandenburg Gate]] in [[Berlin]], the [[CN Tower]] In [[Toronto]], or [[Palace of Culture and Science]] in [[Warsaw]]. [[Church (building)|Church]] [[spire]]s and [[mosque]]'s [[minaret]]s are often very tall and visible from many miles around, thus often serve as built landmarks. Also [[town hall]] towers and [[Belfry (architecture)|belfries]] often have a landmark character.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4159">'''Landscaping''' refers to any activity that modifies the visible features of an area of land, including:

# living [[organism|elements]], such as [[flora]] or [[fauna]]; or what is commonly called [[gardening]], the art and craft of growing plants with a goal of creating a beauty within the [[landscape]].
# natural elements such as [[landform]]s, [[terrain]] shape and elevation, or [[water body|bodies of water]]; and
# abstract elements such as the [[weather]] and lighting conditions.
Landscaping requires expertise in [[horticulture]] and artistic design.

== Understanding the land ==

Construction requires study and observation. It is not the same in different parts of the world. Landscaping varies according to different [[region]]s.&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Diekelmann|first1=John|last2=Schuster|first2=Robert M.|title=Natural Landscaping: Designing with Native Plant Communities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fmajmru4g98C|year=2002|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-17324-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, normally local natural experts are recommended if it is done for the first time. Understanding of the site is one of the chief essentials for successful landscaping. Different natural features like terrain, [[topography]], [[soil quality|soil qualities]], prevailing winds, depth of the [[frost line]], and the system of [[Native plant|native flora]] and fauna must be taken into account.&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ingels|first=Jack|title=Landscaping Principles and Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uJ8XYcUOdI0C|year=2009|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=1-4283-7641-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the land is not fit for landscaping. In order to landscape it, the land must be reshaped. This reshaping of land is called [[Grading (engineering)|grading]].&lt;ref name="google2"/&gt;

[[Earth mover|Removal of earth]] from the land is called cutting while when earth is added to the slope, it is called filling. Sometimes the grading process may involve removal of excessive waste ([[landfill]]s), [[soil]] and rocks, so designers should take into account while in the planning stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Slack|first=William|title=Landscaping|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gwUTtPGct40C|year=1998|publisher=Oxmoor House|isbn=978-0-8487-2251-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buchanan|first=Rita|title=Taylor's Master Guide to Landscaping|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U-NnzL1gJeIC|year=2000|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=0-618-05590-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tools ==

In the start, the [[landscaping contractor]] makes a letter which is a rough design and layout of what could be done with the land in order to achieve the desired outcome.&lt;ref name="google2"/&gt; Different pencils are required to make graphics of the picture. Landscaping has become more technological than natural, as few projects begin without [[bulldozers]], [[lawnmowers]], or [[chainsaws]].&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt; Different areas have different qualities of plants.  When growing new grass, it should ideally be done in the spring and the fall seasons to maximize growth and to minimize the spread of weeds. It is generally agreed that [[Fertilizers]] are required for good plant growth. Some landscapers prefer to use mix [[gravel]] with rocks of varying sizes to add interest in large areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sharon Cohoon and Jim McCausland |url=http://www.landscapingorlandopros.com/ |title=How to Landscape Gravel - Page 2 |publisher=Sunset.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319025558/http://www.sunset.com/garden/landscaping-design/landscaping-with-gravel-00400000011687/page2.html |archivedate=March 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8812">'''Least squares adjustment''' is a model for the solution of an [[overdetermined system]] of equations based on the principle of [[least squares]] of [[observation residuals]]. It is used extensively in the disciplines of [[surveying]], [[geodesy]], and [[photogrammetry]]—the field of [[geomatics]], collectively.

==Formulation==
There are three forms of least squares adjustment: ''parametric'', ''conditional'', and ''combined''. In '''parametric adjustment''', one can find an observation equation ''h(X)=Y'' relating observations ''Y'' explicitly in terms of parameters ''X'' (leading to the A-model below). In '''conditional adjustment''', there exists a condition equation ''g(Y)=0'' involving only observations ''Y'' (leading to the B-model below) — with no parameters ''X'' at all. Finally, in a '''combined adjustment''', both parameters ''X'' and observations ''Y'' are involved implicitly in a mixed-model equation ''f(X,Y)=0''. Clearly, parametric and conditional adjustments correspond to the more general combined case when ''f(X,Y)=h(X)-Y'' and ''f(X,Y)=g(Y)'', respectively. Yet the special cases warrant simpler solutions, as detailed below. Often in the literature, ''Y'' may be denoted ''L''.

==Solution==
The equalities above only hold for the estimated parameters &lt;math&gt;\hat{X}&lt;/math&gt; and observations &lt;math&gt;\hat{Y}&lt;/math&gt;, thus &lt;math&gt;f\left(\hat{X},\hat{Y}\right)=0&lt;/math&gt;. In contrast, measured observations &lt;math&gt;\tilde{Y}&lt;/math&gt; and approximate parameters &lt;math&gt;\tilde{X}&lt;/math&gt; produce a nonzero ''misclosure'':
:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{w} = f\left(\tilde{X},\tilde{Y}\right).&lt;/math&gt;
One can proceed to [[Taylor series expansion]] of the equations, which results in the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobians]] or [[design matrix|design matrices]]: the first one,
:&lt;math&gt;A=\partial{f}/\partial{X};&lt;/math&gt;
and the second one,
:&lt;math&gt;B=\partial{f}/\partial{Y}.&lt;/math&gt;
The linearized model then reads:
:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{w} + A \hat{x} + B \hat{y} = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}=\hat{X}-\tilde{X}&lt;/math&gt; are estimated ''parameter corrections'' to the ''a priori'' values, and &lt;math&gt;\hat{y}=\hat{Y}-\tilde{Y}&lt;/math&gt; are post-fit ''observation [[Errors and residuals in statistics|residuals]]''.

In the parametric adjustment, the second design matrix is an identity, ''B=-I'', and the misclosure vector can be interpreted as the pre-fit residuals, &lt;math&gt;\tilde{y}=\tilde{w}=h(\tilde{X})-\tilde{Y}&lt;/math&gt;, so the system simplifies to:
:&lt;math&gt;A \hat{x} = \hat{y} - \tilde{y},&lt;/math&gt;
which is in the form of [[ordinary least squares]]. 
In the conditional adjustment, the first design matrix is null, ''A=0''.
For the more general cases, [[Lagrange multipliers]] are introduced to relate the two Jacobian matrices and transform the [[Constraint (mathematics)|constrained]] least squares problem into an unconstrained one (albeit a larger one). In any case, their manipulation leads to the &lt;math&gt;\hat{X}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{Y}&lt;/math&gt; vectors as well as the respective parameters and observations ''a posteriori'' covariance matrices.

===Computation===
Given the matrices and vectors above, their solution is found via standard least-squares methods; e.g., forming the [[normal matrix]] and applying [[Cholesky decomposition]], applying the [[QR factorization]] directly to the Jacobian matrix, [[iterative methods]] for very large systems, etc.

==Worked-out examples==
{{expand section|date=June 2014}}

==Applications==
* [[Leveling]], [[Traverse (surveying)|traverse]], and [[control networks]]
* [[Bundle adjustment]]
* [[Triangulation]], [[Trilateration]], [[wikt:Triangulateration|Triangulateration]]
* [[GPS]]/[[GNSS positioning]]
* [[Helmert transformation]]

==Related concepts==
*Parametric adjustment is similar to most of [[regression analysis]] and coincides with the [[Gauss–Markov model]]
*Combined adjustment, also known as the [[Gauss–Helmert model]],&lt;ref&gt;"Gauss-Helmert Model" in: Samuel Kotz; N. Balakrishnan; Campbell Read Brani Vidakovic (2006), ''Encyclopedia of statistical sciences'', Wiley. doi:10.1002/0471667196.ess0854&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J Cothren (2005), "Reliability in Constrained Gauss–Markov Models", Report No. 473.

*The use of ''a priori'' parameter covariance matrix is akin to [[Tikhonov regularization]]

==Extensions==
If [[rank deficiency]] is encountered, it can often be rectified by the inclusion of additional equations imposing constraints on the parameters and/or observations, leading to [[constrained least squares]].

{{otheruses}}
The terms '''''location''''' and '''''place''''' in [[geography]] are used to identify a [[point (spatial)|point]] or an area on the [[Earth]]'s surface or elsewhere. The term ''location'' generally implies a higher degree of certainty than ''place'', the latter often indicating an entity with an ambiguous boundary, relying more on human or social attributes of [[place identity]] and [[sense of place]] than on [[geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Simandan |first=Dragos |date=April 2011 |title=Making sense of place through multiple memory systems|journal=New Zealand Geographer |volume=67 |issue=1 |pages=21–24 |doi=10.1111/j.1745-7939.2011.01194.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of location and place==
===Relative location===
A relative location, or situation, is described as a displacement from another site. An example is "3 miles northwest of [[Seattle]]".

===Locality===
A [[locality (settlement)|location,]] settlement, or populated place is likely to have a well-defined name but a boundary which is not well defined in varies by context. [[London]], for instance, has a legal boundary, but this is unlikely to completely match with general usage. An area within a town, such as [[Covent Garden]] in London, also almost always has some ambiguity as to its extent.

===Absolute location===
An absolute location is designated using a specific pairing of [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] in a [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinate]] grid — for example, a [[Spherical coordinate system]] or an ellipsoid-based system such as the [[World Geodetic System]] — or similar methods. For instance, the position of [[Lake Maracaibo]] in Venezuela can be expressed approximately in the [[WGS84]] coordinate system as the location 9.80°N (latitude), 71.56°W (longitude). It is, however, just one way. Alternative ways can be seen in this Geo Hack link: {{Coord|9.80|N|71.56|W|type:waterbody_region:VE}}.

''Absolute location'', however, is a term with little real meaning, since any location must be expressed relative to something else. For example, longitude is the number of degrees east or west of the [[Prime meridian (Greenwich)|Prime Meridian]], a line arbitrarily chosen to pass through [[Greenwich, London]].  Similarly, latitude is the number of degrees north or south of the [[Equator]]. Because latitude and longitude are expressed ''relative'' to these lines, a position expressed in latitude and longitude is actually a relative location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gersmehl |first=Philip |date=2008 |title=Teaching Geography |edition=2nd |location=New York |publisher=[[Guilford Press]] |pages=60 |isbn=978-1-59385-715-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2014}}
[[File:HistMac.gif|326px|thumb|The contemporary geographical [[Macedonia (region)|region of Macedonia]] is not ''officially defined'' by any international organisation or state. In some contexts it appears to span five current sovereign countries: [[Albania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Greece]], the [[Republic of Macedonia]], and [[Serbia]]. For more details see the ''boundaries and definitions'' section in [[Macedonia (region)#Boundaries and definitions|Macedonia (region)]]]]
The name '''''Macedonia''''' is used in a number of competing or overlapping meanings to describe geographical, political and historical areas, languages and peoples in a part of south-eastern Europe. It has been a major source of political controversy since the early 20th century. The situation is complicated because different ethnic groups use different terminology for the same entity, or the same terminology for different entities, with different political connotations.

Historically, the region has presented markedly shifting borders across the [[Balkans|Balkan]] peninsula. Geographically, no single definition of its borders or the names of its subdivisions is accepted by all scholars and ethnic groups. Demographically, it is mainly inhabited by four ethnic groups, three of which self-identify as ''Macedonians'': two, a [[Macedonians (Bulgarians)|Bulgarian]] and a [[Macedonians (Greeks)|Greek]] one at a regional level, while a third [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|ethnic Macedonian]] one at a national level. Linguistically, the names and affiliations of languages and dialects spoken in the region are a source of controversy. Politically, the rights to the extent of the use of the name ''Macedonia'' and its derivatives has led to a [[Macedonia naming dispute|diplomatic dispute]] between [[Greece]] and the [[Republic of Macedonia]]. Despite mediation of the [[United Nations]], the dispute is still pending resolution since 1993, but as a result it was admitted under the provisional reference of the "former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia", sometimes abbreviated as FYROM.

== Etymology ==
The name ''Macedonia'' derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|Μακεδονία}} (''Makedonía''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2364599 Μακεδονία], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Macedon|kingdom]] (later, [[Macedonia (region)|region]]) named after the [[ancient Macedonians]], from the Greek {{lang|grc|Μακεδόνες}} (''Makedones''), "Macedonians", explained as having originally meant either "the tall ones" or "highlanders".&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|Macedonia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word {{lang|el|Μακεδνόν}} (''Makednon'') is first attested in [[Herodotus]] as the name which the Greek [[Ethnic group|ethnos]] was called (which was later called [[Dorians|Dorian]]) when it settled around [[Pindus]] mountain range.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus , ''Histories'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0125%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D56%3Asection%3D3 1.56.2,3]: "ταῦτα γὰρ ἦν τὰ προκεκριμένα, ἐόντα τὸ ἀρχαῖον τὸ μὲν Πελασγικὸν τὸ δὲ Ἑλληνικὸν ἔθνος. καὶ τὸ μὲν οὐδαμῇ κω ἐξεχώρησε, τὸ δὲ πολυπλάνητον κάρτα. ἐπὶ μὲν γὰρ Δευκαλίωνος βασιλέος οἴκεε γῆν τὴν Φθιῶτιν, ἐπὶ δὲ Δώρου τοῦ Ἕλληνος τὴν ὑπὸ τὴν Ὄσσαν τε καὶ τὸν Ὄλυμπον χώρην, καλεομένην δὲ Ἱστιαιῶτιν: ἐκ δὲ τῆς Ἱστιαιώτιδος ὡς ἐξανέστη ὑπὸ Καδμείων, οἴκεε ἐν Πίνδῳ Μακεδνὸν καλεόμενον: ἐνθεῦτεν δὲ αὖτις ἐς τὴν Δρυοπίδα μετέβη καὶ ἐκ τῆς Δρυοπίδος οὕτω ἐς Πελοπόννησον ἐλθὸν Δωρικὸν ἐκλήθη."&lt;/ref&gt; ''Makednon'' is related to the [[Ancient Greek]] adjective {{lang|grc|μακεδνός}} (''makednós''), meaning "tall, slim",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dmakedno%2Fs μακεδνός], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; attested in [[Homer]] and [[Hesychius of Alexandria]] in its feminine form "μακεδνή" (''makednē''), meaning "long, tall".&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Odyssey'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:abo:tlg,0012,002:7:106&amp;lang=original 7.106]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/hesychiialexand00schmgoog#page/n537/mode/2up Hesychii Alexandrini lexicon]&lt;/ref&gt;  It cognates with the words {{lang|grc|μακρός}} (''makros'', "long, large")&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dmakro%2Fs1 μακρός], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; and {{lang|grc|μήκος}} (''mēkos'', "length"),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dmh%3Dkos μήκος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; both deriving from the [[Indo-European root]] ''*mak-'', meaning "long' or "slender".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.etymonline.com/word/*mak- *mak-], Etymonline&lt;/ref&gt; Linguist [[Robert S.

{{main article|Macedonia (region)#History|l1=History of the region of Macedonia}}
{{Historical Macedonia}}
The [[Macedonia (region)|region of Macedonia]] has been home to several historical political entities, which have used the name ''Macedonia''; the main ones are given below. The borders of each of these entities were different.

=== Early history ===

==== Ancient Macedonia ====
{{Main article|Macedonia (ancient kingdom)}}
[[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]] or ''Macedon'', the ancient [[monarchy|kingdom]],&lt;ref name="Definition of Macedon"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mark|first1=Joshua J.|title=Macedon definition|url=https://www.ancient.eu/macedon/|website=Ancient history|publisher=Ancient History encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;  was located on the periphery of [[Archaic Greece|Archaic]] and [[Classical Greece]], and later became the dominant state of [[Hellenistic Greece]]. It was centered on the fertile plains west of the [[Gulf of Salonica]] (today north-western [[Greece]]); the first Macedonian state emerged in the 8th or early 7th century&amp;nbsp;BC. Its extent beyond the center varied; some Macedonian kings could not hold their capital; [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] expanded his power until it reached from [[Epirus]], across [[Thrace]] to Gallipoli, and from [[Thermopylae]] to the Danube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lane Fox | first=Robin | authorlink = Robin Lane Fox|title=Alexander the Great |publisher=Allen Lane |location=London |year=1973 |isbn=978-0-7139-0500-7 |pages=17, 30}}&lt;/ref&gt; His son [[Alexander the Great]] conquered most of the land in southwestern Asia stretching from what is currently Turkey in the west to parts of India in the east. However, while Alexander's conquests are of major historical importance as having launched the [[Hellenistic Age]], Macedon as a state had no significant territorial gains due to them. Alexander's kingdom fell apart after his death in 323 BC; several of his [[Diadochi|Successors]] attempted to form a kingdom for themselves in Macedonia; the kingdom formed by [[Antigonus Gonatas]] contained all the land Philip II had started with and controlled much of what is now modern Greece; it lasted until the Romans divided it into four republics in 168&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rostovtseff|first=Michael Ivanovitch|title=History of the Ancient World (translated by James Duff Duff)|volume=II|page=78|year=1926|publisher=Biblo &amp; Tannen Publishers|isbn=978-0-8196-2163-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Roman Macedonia ====
{{Main article|Macedonia (Roman province)}}
{{See also|Diocese of Macedonia}}
The ancient Romans had two different entities called ''Macedonia'', at different levels. [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]] was established as a [[Roman province]] in 146&amp;nbsp;BC. Its boundaries were shifted from time to time for administrative convenience, but during the [[Roman Republic]] and the [[Principate]] it extended west to the Adriatic and south to [[Central Greece]].

Under [[Diocletian]], [[Thessaly]], including parts of [[West Macedonia]], was split off to form a new province, and the central and southern Balkan provinces were grouped into the [[Diocese of Moesia]]. At some point in the 4th century (first securely attested in 370) this was divided into two new dioceses, the mostly Latin-speaking [[Diocese of Dacia]] in the north and the mostly Greek-speaking [[Diocese of Macedonia]] in the south. Under [[Constantine the Great]], the western part of the province of Macedonia was also split off to form the new province of [[Epirus nova]].  After Constantine's death, the western Balkans, Macedonia included, became part of the [[praetorian prefecture of Illyricum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Roisman|Worthington|2010|pp=547–548}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the exception of a short-lived division between ''Macedonia Prima'' in the south and ''Macedonia Salutaris'' in the north towards the end of the 4th century (attested only in the ''[[Notitia Dignitatum]]''), Macedonia formed a single province until re-divided into southern and northern parts sometime in the late 5th century (the division is first securely attested in 482), although the province seems to have been reunified by 535. According to the 6th-century ''[[Synecdemus]]'', ''Macedonia Prima'', with [[Thessalonica]] as its capital and governed by a ''[[consularis]]'', counted 32 cities, and  ''Macedonia Secunda'' in the north, with [[Stobi]] as its capital and governed by a ''[[praeses]]'', only eight. The approximate boundary between the two ran on a rough line from north of [[Bitola]] (which belonged to ''Macedonia Prima'') to the area of [[Demir Kapija]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Roisman|Worthington|2010|pp=548–550}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kazhdan|1991|p=1261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Byzantine Macedonia ====
{{Main article|Macedonia (theme)}}
During the 7th century, most of the Balkans were overrun by [[Slavs|Slavic]] invasions, which left only the fortified towns and the coasts in the hands of the Greek-speaking [[Byzantine Empire]]. "[[Macedonia (theme)|Macedonia]]" was then used for a new [[theme (Byzantine administrative unit)|theme]] in the late 8th century under [[Irene of Athens]]. Geographically however it was located in [[Thrace]] and not in Macedonia, which was under the themes of [[Thessalonica (theme)|Thessalonica]], [[Strymon (theme)|Strymon]] and other smaller commands such as [[Boleron]] or [[Drougoubiteia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kazhdan|1991|pp=1261–1262, 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; Themes were not named geographically and the original sense was "army". They became districts during the military and fiscal crisis of the seventh century, when the Byzantine armies were instructed to find their supplies from the locals, wherever they happened to be. Thus the [[Armeniac theme]] was considerably west of [[Armenia]]; the [[Thracesian Theme]] was in Asia Minor, not in Thrace.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Treadgold|1997|pp=421, 478, ''et passim''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Macedonian dynasty]] of the Byzantine Empire acquired its name from its founder, [[Basil I the Macedonian]], an [[Armenians|Armenian]] by descent, who was born in the theme of Macedonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Treadgold|1997|p=455}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The interior of Macedonia remained in Slavic and later [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian]] hands until the [[Byzantine conquest of Bulgaria|campaigns]] of [[Basil II]], which ended the existence of the Bulgarian state and extended Byzantine authority across the central and northern Balkans. Thereafter Macedonia remained under Byzantine control until the [[Fourth Crusade]] (1204). A short-lived  [[Latins (Middle Ages)|Latin]] [[Kingdom of Thessalonica]] was established which survived until 1224, when it was captured by [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]]. Most of Macedonia then came under the control of the [[Empire of Nicaea]] in 1246, although its northern regions remained disputed with the [[Medieval Serbia|Serbs]] and the [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarians]]. Most of the region was conquered by the Serbs under [[Stephen Dushan]] during the [[Byzantine civil war of 1341–1347]]. Only Thessalonica and its environs remained in Byzantine hands. By the late 14th century, the [[Ottoman Turks]] in turn had conquered the region, although Thessalonica held out under Byzantine and later [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] control [[Siege of Thessalonica (1422–1430)|until 1430]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kazhdan|1991|pp=1262, 2072–2073}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ottomans and geographical Macedonia ====
{{Main article|Ottoman Macedonia (disambiguation){{!}}Ottoman Macedonia}}
{{See also|Macedonian Struggle|Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization}}

The Ottomans did not keep Macedonia as an [[Subdivisions of the Ottoman Empire|administrative unit]]&lt;ref&gt;The region was not called "Macedonia" by the Ottomans, and the name "Macedonia" gained currency together with the ascendance of rival nationalism.

{{See also|Peoples Liberation War of Macedonia|National Liberation Front (Macedonia)}}

Since the early stages of the [[Greek Revolution]], the provisional government of Greece claimed Macedonia as part of Greek national territory, but the [[Treaty of Constantinople (1832)]], which established a Greek independent state, set its northern boundary between [[Arta, Greece|Arta]] and [[Volos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=John | last= Comstock| title= History of the Greek Revolution| location= New York |year= 1829|page=5|publisher=W. W. Reed &amp; co}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Ottoman Empire]] started breaking apart, ''Macedonia'' was claimed by all members of the [[Balkan League]] ([[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]], Greece and Bulgaria), and by [[Romania]]. Under the [[Treaty of San Stefano]] that ended the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877–78]] the entire region, except Thessaloniki, was included in the borders of [[Bulgaria]], but after the [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1878 the region was returned to the Ottoman Empire. The armies of the Balkan League advanced and occupied ''Macedonia'' in the [[First Balkan War]] in 1912. Because of disagreements between the allies about the partition of the region, the [[Second Balkan War]] erupted, and in its aftermath the arbitrary region of Macedonia was split into the following entities, that existed or still exist in this region:
* [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] (as a region of Greece) refers to three [[modern regions of Greece|regions]] in [[northern Greece]], incorporated in 1913, as a result of the [[Balkan Wars]] between the Ottoman Empire and the [[Balkan League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Poulton|2000|pp=85–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Macedonia (as a [[People's Republic]] within [[Yugoslavia]]) used to refer to the [[People's Republic of Macedonia]] established in 1946, later known as the Socialist Republic of Macedonia, one of the constituent republics of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], renamed in 1963.&lt;ref name=LOC&gt;{{loc}} {{cite web| url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/yutoc.html | title= The Library of Congress, Country Studies | website=Yugoslavia | accessdate = 17 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1929 and 1941 this region was part of [[Vardar Banovina]] province in the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].

== Geography ==
Macedonia (as a current geographical term) refers to a region of the Balkan peninsula in [[south-eastern Europe]], covering some 60,000 or 70,000 square kilometers. Although the region's borders are not officially defined by any international organization or state, in some contexts, the territory appears to correspond to the basins of (from west to east) the [[Haliacmon]] (Aliákmonas), [[Vardar|Vardar / Axios]] and [[Struma River|Struma / Strymónas]] rivers, and the plains around Thessaloniki and Serres.{{#tag:ref|For an attempt to delineate the boundaries of the region, see Kontogiorgi (2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Kontogiorgi |first=Elisabeth |title=Population Exchange in Greek Macedonia |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-19-927896-1 |pages=11–13 |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Macedonia 1870–1922&amp;nbsp;– The Regional Context}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}

In a [[Historical regions of the Balkan Peninsula|historic context]], the term ''Macedonia'' was used in various ways. Macedonia was not an administrative division of the Ottoman Empire; its entire territory was part of the ''beylerbeylik'' of [[Rumelia]].&lt;ref name="mccarthy1"&gt;{{cite book|first=Justin|last=McCarthy|authorlink=Justin McCarthy (American historian)|year= 2001|title=The Ottoman Peoples and the End of Empire|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-340-70657-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rossos|2008|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; The geographer H.&amp;nbsp;R.

Many [[ethnographic]] maps were produced in this period of controversy; these differ primarily in the areas given to each nationality within Macedonia. This was in part a result of the choice of definition: an inhabitant of Macedonia might well have different nationalities depending on whether the basis of classification was [[religious denomination|denomination]], [[kinship and descent|descent]], [[language]], [[self-identification]] or personal choice. In addition, the Ottoman census, taken on the basis of [[religion]], was misquoted by all sides; descent, or "[[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]", was largely conjectural; inhabitants of Macedonia might speak a different language at the market and at home, and the same Slavic dialect might be called Serbian "with Bulgarian influences", Macedonian, or West-Bulgarian.{{#tag:ref|For the difficulties to determine the national divisions of the population through the Ottoman census, see Jelavich (1993).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Jelavich|first=Barbara|title=History of the Balkans|year=1993|isbn=978-0-521-27459-3|chapter=The end of Ottoman Rule in Europe|page=91|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the Ottoman census and surveys about the population of Macedonia between 1882–1906, see Shaw (1977).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Shaw|first=Ezel Kural|title=History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey|year=1977|isbn=978-0-521-29166-8|chapter=The Rise of Modern Turkey|pages=208–209|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}

These maps also differed somewhat in the boundaries given to Macedonia. Its only inarguable limits were the [[Aegean Sea]] and the Serbian and Bulgarian frontiers (as of 1885); where it bordered Old Serbia, Albania, and Thrace (all parts of Ottoman [[Rumelia]]) was debatable.&lt;ref name="wilkinson"/&gt;

The Greek ethnographer Nicolaides, the Austrian Meinhard, and the Bulgarian Kǎnčev placed the northern boundary of Macedonia at the [[Šar Mountain]]s and the [[Skopska Crna Gora|Crna hills]], as had scholars before 1878. The Serb Gopčevič preferred a line much further south, assigning the entire region from Skopje to [[Strumica]] to "Old Serbia"; and some later Greek geographers have defined a more restricted Macedonia. In addition, maps might vary in smaller details: as to whether this town or that was Macedonian. One Italian map included [[Prizren]], where Nicolaides and Meinhard had drawn the boundary just south of it. On the south and west, [[Grevena]], [[Korçë]], and [[Konitsa]] varied from map to map; on the east, the usual line is the lower [[Mesta River|Mesta / Nestos]] river and then north or northwest, but one German geographer takes the line so far west as to exclude [[Bansko]] and [[Gotse Delchev (town)|Nevrokop / Gotse Delchev]].&lt;ref name="wilkinson"/&gt;

==== Major regions ====
The region of Macedonia is commonly split geographically into three main sub-regions, especially when discussing the Macedonian Question. The terms are used in non-partisan scholarly works, although they are also used in [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|ethnic Macedonian]] literature of an [[irredentist]] nature.&lt;ref name= mymk&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mymacedonia.net/aegean/aegean.htm | title=Aegean Part of Macedonia|publisher=MyMacedonia.net | accessdate = 22 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It reports [[Josip Broz Tito]] using the term "Aegean Macedonia" on 11 October 1945 in the buildup to the Greek Civil War; the original document is archived in 'GFM A/24581/G2/1945'. For Athens, the "new term, Aegean Macedonia", (also ''"Pirin Macedonia"''), was introduced by Yugoslavs. Contextually, this observation indicates this was part of the Yugoslav offensive against Greece, laying claim to Greek Macedonia, but Athens does not take issue with the term itself. The 1945 date concurs with Bulgarian sources.

In addition to the above named sub-regions, there are also two smaller regions, in [[Albania]] and Serbia respectively. These regions are also considered geographically part of Macedonia.

== Demographics ==
{{main article|Demographic history of Macedonia}}

The region, as defined above, has a total population of about 5 million. The main disambiguation issue in demographics is the self-identifying name of two contemporary groups. The ethnic Macedonian population of the Republic of Macedonia self-identify as ''Macedonian'' on a national level, while the Greek Macedonians self-identify as both ''Macedonian'' on a regional, and ''Greek'' on a national level. According to the Greek arguments, the ancient Macedonians' nationality was Greek and thus, the use of the term on a national level lays claims to their history. This disambiguation problem has led to a wide variety of terms used to refer to the separate groups, more information of which can be found in the [[#Terminology by group|terminology by group]] section.

{{See also|Political views on the Macedonian language}}

As language is one of the elements tied in with national identity, the same disputes that are voiced over demographics are also found in linguistics. There are two main disputes about the use of the word Macedonian to describe a linguistic phenomenon, be it a language or a dialect:

Modern [[Macedonian language]],&lt;ref name=offensive3 group=Note/&gt; a [[South Slavic languages|south Slavic]] language, is unrelated to the Ancient Macedonian language. It is currently the subject of two major disputes.

{{See also|Macedonia naming dispute}}

The controversies in geographic, linguistic and demographic terms, are also manifested in international politics. Among the autonomous countries that were formed as a result of the breakup of [[Yugoslavia]] in the 1990s, was the (until then) subnational entity of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], by the official name of "Socialist Republic of Macedonia", the others being Serbia, [[Slovenia]], [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Montenegro]]. The peaceful break-away of that nation resulted in the change of its name to "Republic of Macedonia".

[[Loring Danforth]], a professor of anthropology at [[Bates College]], asserts that ethnic Macedonian nationalists, who are concerned with demonstrating the continuity between ancient and modern Macedonians, deny they are Slavs and claim to be the direct descendants of Alexander the Great and the ancient Macedonians. Danforth stresses, however, that the more moderate Macedonian position, publicly endorsed by [[Kiro Gligorov]], the first president of the Republic of Macedonia, is modern Macedonians have no relation to Alexander the Great, but are a Slavic people whose ancestors arrived in Macedonia in the sixth century AD. Proponents of both the extreme and the moderate Macedonian positions stress that the ancient Macedonians were a distinct non-Greek people. In addition to affirming the existence of the Macedonian nation, Macedonians are concerned with affirming the existence of a unique Macedonian language as well. They thus emphasize that the Macedonian language has a history dating to the Old Church Slavonic used by [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]] in the ninth century.&lt;ref name="Danforth_gate"&gt;{{cite book| title=How can a woman give birth to one Greek and one Macedonian? | url= http://www.gate.net/~mango/How_can_a_woman_give_birth.htm | work=The construction of national identity among immigrants to Australia from Northern Greece | first=Loring M. | last= Danforth |accessdate=26 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although ethnic Macedonians agree Macedonian minorities exist in Bulgaria and Greece and these minorities have been subjected to harsh policies of forced assimilation, there are two different positions with regard to what their future should be. These were summarized by Danforth:&lt;ref name="Danforth_gate"/&gt;{{#tag:ref|Most quotations within the text are from [[Evangelos Kofos]]: "Most precious jewels" from a [[Boston Globe]] article of 5 January 1993, the others from ''Nationalism and communism'', Thessalonica, 1964.|group=Note}}

They do, however, demand that Bulgaria and Greece recognize the existence of Macedonian minorities in their countries and grant them the basic human rights they deserve.}}

=== Greek nationalism ===
{{See also|Greek nationalism}}

Danforth describes the Greek position on Macedonia as follows: because Alexander the Great and the ancient Macedonians were Greeks, and because ancient and modern Greece are bound in an unbroken line of racial and cultural continuity, it is only Greeks who have the right to identify themselves as Macedonians. According to Danforth, this is why Greeks generally refer to Ethnic Macedonians as "Skopians", a practice comparable to calling Greeks "Athenians". Danforth asserts that the negation of Macedonian identity in Greek nationalist ideology focuses on three main points: the existence of a Macedonian nation, a Macedonian language, and a Macedonian minority in Greece. More specifically, Danforth says:&lt;ref name="Danforth_gate"/&gt;

{{blockquote|From the Greek nationalist perspective there cannot be a Macedonian nation since there has never been an independent Macedonian state: the Macedonian nation is an "artificial creation", an "invention", of Tito, who "baptized" a "mosaic of nationalities" with the Greek name "Macedonians". Similarly Greek nationalists claim that because the language spoken by the ancient Macedonians was Greek, the Slavic language spoken by the "Skopians" cannot be called "the Macedonian language." Greek sources generally refer to it as "the linguistic idiom of Skopje" and describe it as a corrupt and impoverished dialect of Bulgarian. Finally, the Greek government denies the existence of a Macedonian minority in northern Greece, claiming that there exists only a small group of "Slavophone Hellenes" or "bilingual Greeks", who speak Greek and "a local Slavic dialect" but have a "Greek national consciousness".}}

Thus from the Greek nationalist perspective the use of the term "Macedonian" by the "Slavs of Skopje" constitutes a "felony", an "act of plagiarism" against the Greek people. Greek nationalists believe that, by calling themselves "Macedonians", the ethnic Macedonians are "stealing" a Greek name, "embezzling" Greek cultural heritage, and "falsifying" Greek history.{{#tag:ref|Danforth quotes Kofos, telling a foreign reporter, "It is as if a robber came into my house and stole my most precious jewels—my history, my culture, my identity."&lt;ref name="Danforth_gate"/&gt;|group=Note}} Greek fears that the use of the name "Macedonia" by the ethnic Macedonians will inevitably lead to the assertion of irredentist claims to territory in Greek Macedonia are heightened by fairly recent historical events.{{#tag:ref|"During World War II Bulgaria occupied portions of northern Greece, while one of the specific goals of the founders of the People's Republic of Macedonia in 1944 was "the unification of the entire Macedonian nation", to be achieved by "the liberation of the other two segments" of Macedonia."&lt;ref name="Danforth_gate"/&gt;|group=Note}}

From a different point of view, Demetrius Andreas M.-A. Floudas, of [[Hughes Hall, Cambridge]], a leading commentator on the naming dispute from the Greek side, sums up this nationalistic reaction as follows: the Republic of Macedonia was accused of usurping the historical and cultural patrimony of Greece "in order to furnish a nucleus of national self-esteem for the new state and provide its citizens with a new, distinct, non-Bulgarian, non-Serbian, non-Albanian identity". The Republic emerged thus to Greek eyes as a country with a personality crisis, "a nondescript parasitic state" that lived off the history of its neighbours, because it allegedly lacked an illustrious past of its own, for the sake of achieving cohesion for what Greeks regarded as an "unhomogeneous little new nation". Floudas criticizes Greek stance as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Floudas|first=Demetrius Andreas|journal=Journal of Political and Military Sociology|volume=24|page=285|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/11160801/name-conflict-conflict-name-analysis-greeces-dispute-fyrom|title=A Name for a Conflict or a Conflict for a Name? An Analysis of Greece's Dispute with FYROM|accessdate=24 January 2007 | year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|What appeared to go unquestioned in Greece nevertheless was whether there was indeed substance in the claims of FYROM that their citizens do feel members of a distinct 'Macedonian' nationality. To answer this appropriately, neither the decades of persistent indoctrination [during Tito's time] should be left out of consideration, nor Greece's violent struggle since 1991 in contrast to her complacency for the 45 years before this. If it was a common bond that the people in Skopje wanted, they found it by claiming this name and rallying the whole population in a united resistance front under a common cause against pugnacious Greece. After this bitter and protracted struggle, even the ones in FYROM who might have not initially been infused with any distinct Macedonian ethnic identity must be feeling very Macedonian now, thanks to Greece}}

As of early 2008, the official position of Greece, adopted unanimously by the four largest political parties, has made a more moderate shift towards accepting a "composite name solution" (i.e. the use of the name "Macedonia" plus some qualifier), so as to disambiguate the former Yugoslav Republic from the Greek region of Macedonia and the wider geographic region of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.mfa.gr/www.mfa.gr/en-US/Policy/Geographic+Regions/South-Eastern+Europe/Balkans/Bilateral+Relations/FYROM/FYROM+-+THE+NAME+ISSUE.htm |publisher=Hellenic Republic, Ministry of Foreign Affairs |accessdate=17 July 2006 |title=Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM)&amp;nbsp;— The Name Issue |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060708044400/http://www2.mfa.gr/www.mfa.gr/en-US/Policy/Geographic%2BRegions/South-Eastern%2BEurope/Balkans/Bilateral%2BRelations/FYROM/FYROM%2B-%2BTHE%2BNAME%2BISSUE.htm |archivedate=8 July 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Skai News|url=http://www.skai.gr/master_story.php?id=74004|title=KKE about Kosovo&amp;nbsp;— FYROM|language=Greek|accessdate=3 June 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002044531/http://www.skai.gr/master_story.php?id=74004|archivedate=2 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology by group ==
All these controversies have led ethnic groups in Macedonia to use terms in conflicting ways. Despite the fact that these terms may not always be used in a [[pejorative]] way, they may be perceived as such by the ethnic group to which they are applied. Both Greeks and ethnic Macedonians generally use all terms deriving from ''Macedonia'' to describe their own regional or ethnic group, and have devised several other terms to disambiguate the other side, or the region in general.

Bulgarians and ethnic Macedonians seek to deny the self-identification of the [[Slavic-speakers of Greek Macedonia|Slavic speaking minority]] in northern Greece, which mostly self-identifies as Greek.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Shea|1997|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain terms are in use by these groups as outlined below. Any denial of self-identification by any side, or any attribution of Macedonia related terms by third parties to the other side, can be seen as highly offensive. General usage of these terms follows:

=== Bulgarian ===
* '''[[Grecomans|Gărkomani]]''' (Гъркомани) is a derogatory term used to refer to the largest portion of the Slavic-speaking minority of Macedonia in Greece who self-identify as Greeks.
* '''[[Macedonian Bulgarians|Macedonian]]''' (Македонец) is a person originating from the region of Macedonia&amp;nbsp;– the term has only regional, not ethnic meaning, and it usually means a Bulgarian, or a clarification is made (Greek, Albanian...).
* '''[[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]''' (Македонски) and the [[Slavic language (Greece)|Slavic dialects of Greece]] are considered dialects of Bulgarian by Bulgarian linguists; not independent languages or dialects of other languages (e.g. Serbian). This is also the popular view in Bulgaria. The Bulgarian government, therefore, has officially recognized the language merely as "the constitutional language of the Republic of Macedonia".&lt;ref name=bcb /&gt;&lt;ref name= BulLang&gt;{{cite press release | title = Article: Bulgaria Recognizes Macedonian Language | publisher = AIMpress Sofia&amp;nbsp;– Skopje | date = 22 February 2006| url = http://www.aimpress.ch/dyn/trae/archive/data/199902/90222-005-trae-sof.htm | accessdate = 25 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Translations are officially called "adaptations".
* '''[[Macedonism]]''' (Македонизъм) is the political ideology or simply views that the Slavs of Macedonia are an ethnic group separate from Bulgarians, with their own separate language, history and culture. It is also used to describe what Bulgarians view as the falsification of their history whether by Macedonian or foreign scholars who subscribe to the Macedonist point of view. It carries strong negative connotations.&lt;ref name=macedonism&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rychlík |first=Jan |year=2007|title=The Consciousness of the Slavonic Orthodox Population in Pirin Macedonia and the Identity of the Population of Moravia and Moravian Slovakia |journal=Sprawy Narodowościowe |volume= |issue=31 |pages=183–197 |id= |url=http://www.ceeol.com/aspx/issuedetails.aspx?issueid=e89e2e39-164b-4bd4-9632-b0ebc2cce969&amp;articleId=1eebae8c-34b9-42a4-8537-3089639fb54c |accessdate=11 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Macedonistics]]''' (Македонистика) is a term, generally synonymous with disciplines such as study of the origins of the Macedonian language and history of the Macedonian people conducted in the Republic of Macedonia and in former Yugoslavia. It is generally considered in Bulgaria to be a kind of [[pseudoscience]].
* '''[[Macedonism|Macedonist]]''' (Македонист) is a person (typically Macedonian Slav) who believes that Macedonian Slavs are not ethnic Bulgarians but a separate ethnic group, directly descended from the ancient Macedonians. It is a more negatively charged synonym of "Macedonian nationalist". More rarely it is used for someone associated with the study of the origins of the Macedonian language and history of the Macedonian people (not necessarily from the Republic of Macedonia or Yugoslavia), whose studies support the official historical doctrine of the Republic of Macedonia or former Yugoslavia.&lt;ref name=macedonism /&gt;
* '''[[Serbomans|Sărbomani]]''' (Сърбомани) is a derogatory term used to refer to people in the Republic of Macedonia self-identifying as Serbian, or having a pro-Serb orientation. It is also used pejoratively by Bulgarians to refer to Macedonians who refuse the Bulgarian national idea.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=P-1m1FLtrvsC&amp;pg=PA226&amp;dq=serbomans&amp;hl=bg&amp;ei=2BbjTuPEPImf-Qb79aXrBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=serbomans&amp;f=false Contested Ethnic Identity: The Case of Macedonian Immigrants in Toronto, 1900-1996, Chris Kostov, Peter Lang, 2010, p. 226.], {{ISBN|3-0343-0196-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Old Bulgarian]]''' (Старобългарски) is the name Bulgarians give to the [[Old Church Slavonic language]] used in the [[Ohrid Literary School]] among others. In contrast, Old Church Slavonic is rarely referred to by ethnic Macedonians as "Old Macedonian" or "Old Slavic".&lt;ref name= OldChurchSlav&gt;{{harvp|Shea|1997|p=198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Greek ===
* '''Macedonia''' (Μακεδονία) can refer to the region of Macedonia or to Macedonia in Greece depending on the context—usually the first being disambiguated.&lt;ref name= Meizon&gt;{{cite book |year=1997 |title=Μείζον Ελληνικό Λεξικό ("Mízon Hellinikó Lexikó") |editor1=Tegopoulos |editor2=Fytrakis |pages=674, 1389 |publisher=Ekdoseis Armonia A.E. |isbn=978-960-7598-04-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''notice to mariners''' (NTM&lt;ref&gt;Web site uses abbreviation NTM&lt;/ref&gt;) advises mariners of important matters affecting navigational safety, including new [[Hydrography|hydrographic information]], changes in [[channel (geography)|channel]]s and aids to [[navigation]], and other important data.

Over 60 countries which produce nautical charts also
produce a notice to mariners. About one third of these are
weekly, another third are bi-monthly or monthly, and the
rest irregularly issued according to need. For example, the [[United Kingdom Hydrographic Office]] issues weekly updates.

==United States==

The U.S. ''Notice to Mariners'' is made available weekly by the [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]] (NGA), prepared jointly with the [[National Ocean Service]] (NOS) and the [[U.S. Coast Guard]]. The information in the ''Notice to Mariners'' is formatted to simplify the correction of [[nautical chart|paper charts]], ''[[List of Lights]]'', ''[[Light List]]s'', ''[[United States Coast Pilots]]'', and other publications produced by NGA, NOS, and the U.S. Coast Guard.

Information for the ''Notice to Mariners'' is contributed
by: the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (Department of Defense) for waters
outside the territorial limits of the United States; National
Ocean Service ([[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]],
[[Department of Commerce]]), which is charged
with surveying and charting the coasts and harbors of the
United States and its territories; the U.S. Coast Guard ([[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]]) which is responsible for the safety of life at sea and the establishment and operation of aids to navigation; and the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] ([[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]), which is charged with the
improvement of rivers and harbors of the United States. In
addition, important contributions are made by foreign hydrographic
offices and cooperating observers of all
nationalities.

The Notice consists of a page of Hydrograms listing
important items in the Notice, a chart correction
section organized by ascending chart number, a product catalog corrections section, a publications
correction section, a summary of broadcast
navigation warnings, and a page of additional miscellaneous information. It is the responsibility of users to decide which of their
charts and publications require correction.
Mariners are requested to cooperate in the correction of
charts and publications by reporting all discrepancies between
published information and conditions actually
observed and by recommending appropriate improvements. A reporting form is provided in the back of each
''Notice to Mariners''.

Issue No. 1 of each year contains important
information on a variety of subjects which supplements
information not usually found on charts and in navigational
publications. This information is published as Special Notice
to Mariners Paragraphs. Additional items considered
of interest to the mariner are also included in this Notice.

Much of the data
in the U.S. ''Notice to Mariners'' is obtained from foreign
notices.

==Canada==
In Canada, the Canadian Coast Guard (CCG) [http://www.notmar.gc.ca/ Notice to Mariners] publication informs mariners of important navigational safety matters affecting Canadian Waters.  This electronic publication is published on a monthly basis and can be downloaded from the [http://www.notmar.gc.ca/go.php?doc=eng/services/notmar/index Notices to Mariners (NOTMAR) Web site].  The information in the Notice to Mariners is formatted to simplify the correction of paper charts and navigational publications.

The [http://www.notmar.gc.ca/ NOTMAR.gc.ca] site is a free 24/7 service providing mariners with up-to-date safety advisories.   It provides mariners with a quick and easy to use interface to access Notices to Mariners information. This system also generates [http://www.notmar.gc.ca/search/mycharts-eng.php?czozMDoibnRtPXN0ZXBfb25lc3RhcnQmYWNjZXB0cHJpdj0xIjs= weekly and monthly notification mailers], for its registered users.  These on-line mail services provides the [http://www.notmar.gc.ca/subscribe/ monthly Notices to Mariners publications] as well as the weekly(section II - chart corrections) notices that advise the mariner of the notices that have been issued against their chart selections.  These mail services simplify the process for registered clients to update their publications and charts as required under the Canada Shipping Act.

The NOTMAR web site also includes the [http://www.notmar.gc.ca/go.php?doc=eng/services/notmar/numindex historical Chart corrections] and [http://www.notmar.gc.ca/go.php?doc=eng/services/notmar/sec4index historical Sailing Direction corrections]; as well, it provides access to downloadable Chart Patches, contains links to CHS’s Chart Number 1, instructions for applying Notices to mariners to manually update their paper charts, and other useful information.

==Summary of Corrections==
A close companion to the ''Notice to Mariners'' is the '''[http://msi.nga.mil/MSISiteContent/StaticFiles/SOCDownloadPage.htm Summary of Corrections]'''. The ''Summary'' is published in five volumes. Each volume covers a major portion of the earth including several chart regions and many subregions.  Volume 5 also includes special charts and publications corrected
by the ''Notice to Mariners''. Since the Summaries contain cumulative corrections, any chart, regardless of its print date, can be corrected with the proper volume of the Summary and all subsequent ''Notice to Mariners''.

The plan includes leaving the dock and harbor area, the ''en route'' portion of a voyage, approaching the destination, and [[Mooring (watercraft)|mooring]], the industry term for this is 'berth to berth'.  According to international law, a vessel's [[captain (nautical)|captain]] is legally responsible for passage planning,&lt;ref name="reg34"&gt;{{cite web

Studies show that [[human error]] is a factor in 80 percent of navigational accidents and that in many cases the human making the error had access to information that could have prevented the accident.&lt;ref name="annex24"/&gt;  The practice of voyage planning has evolved from penciling lines on [[nautical chart]]s to a process of [[risk management]].&lt;ref name="annex24"/&gt;

==Planning stages==
[[File:Cruising sailor navigating.jpg|thumb|Monitoring progress and comparing it to the plan are key to passage planning.]]
Passage planning consists of four stages: appraisal, planning, execution, and monitoring.&lt;ref name="annex24"/&gt;  These stages are specified in ''[[International Maritime Organization]] Resolution A.893(21), Guidelines For Voyage Planning,''&lt;ref name="annex25-1"&gt;International Maritime Organization, Section 1 of ''Guidelines for Voyage Planning'', 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; which are, in turn, reflected in the local laws of IMO signatory countries.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in [[33 CFR|Title 33 of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Guidelines'' specify fifty elements of passage planning, some of which are only applicable in certain situations.&lt;ref name="bow367"/&gt;

The ''Guidelines'' specify three key items to consider in the practice of voyage planning:

*having and using a voyage plan is "of essential importance for safety of life at sea, safety and efficiency of navigation and protection of the marine environment,"&lt;ref name="annex25-1"/&gt;
* voyage planning is necessary for all types of vessels on all types of voyages,&lt;ref name="annex25-1"/&gt; and
* the plan's scope should be based on all information available, should be "berth to berth," including when [[harbour pilot|under pilotage]], and the plan includes the execution and the monitoring of progress.&lt;ref name="annex25-1"/&gt;

Voyage planning starts with the appraisal stage.  Before each voyage begins, the navigator should develop a detailed [[mental model]] of how the entire voyage will proceed.&lt;ref name="bow367"&gt;Bowditch 2002, p. 367.&lt;/ref&gt;  The appraisal stage consists of gathering and contemplating all information relevant to the voyage.  Much of this appraisal is done by consulting [[nautical chart]]s, [[nautical publications]] and performing a number of technical tasks such as weather forecasting, prediction of tides and currents, and checks of local regulations and warnings.&lt;ref name="annex25-2"&gt;International Maritime Organization, Section 2 of ''Guidelines for Voyage Planning'', 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nautical publications are a valuable guide to local conditions and regulations, but they must be updated and actually read to be of any use.&lt;ref name="chap4"&gt;{{cite web
 |title       = Chapter 4, Nautical Publications
 |url         = http://www.irbs.com/bowditch/

 |df          = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These publications could include [[Sailing Directions]] and [[Coast Pilots]] or similar texts produced by other authorities.&lt;ref name="annex25-2"/&gt;

The next stage of the process is known as the planning stage.  Once information is gathered and considered, the navigator can begin the process of actually laying out the voyage.  The process involves projecting various future events including landfalls, narrow passages, and course changes expected during the voyage.&lt;ref name="bow367"/&gt; This mental model becomes the standard by which the navigator measures progress toward the goal of a safe and efficient voyage, and it is manifested in a passage plan.&lt;ref name="bow367"/&gt;

A good passage plan will include a track line laid out upon the best-scale charts available.&lt;ref name="bow267"&gt;Bowditch 2002, p.214.&lt;/ref&gt;  This track is judged with respect to at least nine separate criteria given in the ''Guidelines'' including under-keel clearance, safe speed, air draft, the use of routing and reporting services (TSS and VTS), and the availability of contingencies in case of emergency.&lt;ref name="annex25-3"&gt;International Maritime Organization, Section 3 of ''Guidelines for Voyage Planning'', 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Navigation system on a merchant ship.jpg|right|thumb|Modern navigators often enter passage plans on [[ECDIS|electronic systems]]]]The navigator will draw and redraw the [[Course (navigation)|track line]] until it is safe, efficient, and in line with all applicable laws and regulations.&lt;ref name="bow367"/&gt;  When the track is finished, it is becoming common practice to also enter it into electronic navigation tools such as an [[Electronic Chart Display and Information System]], a [[chartplotter]], an [[Automatic radar plotting aid|ARPA]] system, or a [[GPS]] unit.&lt;ref name="bow224-225"&gt;Bowditch 2002, pp 224–225.&lt;/ref&gt;

When working in a team environment, the passage plan should be communicated to the navigation team in a pre-voyage conference in order to ensure that all members of the team share the same mental model of the entire trip.&lt;ref name="bow367"/&gt;

The third stage of passage planning is the execution stage.  The IMO was careful to include execution as part of the process of passage planning.  This underscores the fact that the ''Guidelines'' list a number of tasks that are to executed during the course of the voyage.  It also reiterates the captain's responsibility to treat the plan as a "living document" and to review or change it in case of any special circumstances that should arise.&lt;ref name="annex25-4"&gt;International Maritime Organization, Section 4 of ''Guidelines for Voyage Planning'', 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth and final stage of voyage planning is the monitoring stage.  Once the voyage has begun the progress of the vessel along its planned route must be monitored. This requires that the ship's position be determined, using standard methods including [[dead reckoning]], [[celestial navigation]], [[Maritime pilot|pilotage]], and [[electronic navigation]].

According to the ''Guidelines,'' the passage plan should always be available to the [[deck officer|officer on watch]] on the bridge.  The ''Guidelines'' also specify that deviations from the plan should be clearly recorded and be consistent with other provisions of the ''Guidelines.''&lt;ref name="annex25-5"&gt;International Maritime Organization, Section 5 of ''Guidelines for Voyage Planning'', 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computer aids==
In modern times, computer software can greatly simplify the passage planning process and ensure that nothing important is overlooked.&lt;ref name="bow367"/&gt; Passage planning software may include functions such as waypoint management, distance calculators, tide and tidal current
predictors, celestial navigational calculators, consumables estimators for fuel, oil, water, and stores, and other useful applications.&lt;ref name="bow367"/&gt;

The '''prisoner's dilemma''' is a standard example of a game analyzed in [[game theory]] that shows why two completely [[Rationality#Economics|rational]] individuals might not cooperate, even if it appears that it is in their best interests to do so. It was originally framed by [[Merrill Flood]] and [[Melvin Dresher]] while working at [[RAND Corporation|RAND]] in 1950. [[Albert W. Tucker]] formalized the game with prison sentence rewards and named it "prisoner's dilemma",&lt;ref&gt;Poundstone, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; presenting it as follows:

{{quote|Two members of a criminal gang are arrested and imprisoned. Each prisoner is in solitary confinement with no means of communicating with the other. The prosecutors lack sufficient evidence to convict the pair on the principal charge, but they have enough to convict both on a lesser charge. Simultaneously, the prosecutors offer each prisoner a bargain. Each prisoner is given the opportunity either to betray the other by testifying that the other committed the crime, or to cooperate with the other by remaining silent. The offer is:
* If A and B each betray the other, each of them serves two years in prison
* If A betrays B but B remains silent, A will be set free and B will serve three years in prison (and vice versa)
* If A and B both remain silent, both of them will only serve one year in prison (on the lesser charge).}}

It is implied that the prisoners will have no opportunity to reward or punish their partner other than the prison sentences they get and that their decision will not affect their reputation in the future. Because betraying a partner offers a greater reward than cooperating with them, all purely rational self-interested prisoners will betray the other, meaning the only possible outcome for two purely rational prisoners is for them to betray each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Milovsky|first=Nicholas|title=The Basics of Game Theory and Associated Games|url=http://issuu.com/johnsonnick895/docs/game_theory_paper|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The interesting part of this result is that pursuing individual reward logically leads both of the prisoners to betray when they would get a better reward if they both kept silent. In reality, humans display a [[systemic bias]] towards cooperative behavior in this and similar games despite what is predicted by simple models of "rational" self-interested action.&lt;ref name = Fehr&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Fehr | first1= Ernst | last2=Fischbacher | first2=Urs   | date= Oct 23, 2003 | title=The Nature of human altruism |journal=Nature | volume=425 | pages=785–91 | publisher=Nature Publishing Group| doi=10.1038/nature02043 | url=http://www.iwp.jku.at/born/mpwfst/04/nature02043_f_born.pdf | accessdate=February 27, 2013 | pmid=14574401 | issue=6960|bibcode = 2003Natur.425..785F }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Amos&gt;{{cite book | title=Preference, belief, and similarity: selected writings. | publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology Press | first1= Amos | last1=Tversky | first2=Eldar | last2=Shafir | url=http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~gary/PAPER-SUGGESTIONS/Preference,%20Belief,%20and%20Similarity%20Selected%20Writings%20(Bradford%20Books).pdf  | year=2004 | isbn=9780262700931 | accessdate=February 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ahn"&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Toh-Kyeong|first1 = Ahn|last2 = Ostrom|first2 = Elinor|last3 = Walker|first3 = James|date = Sep 5, 2002|title = Incorporating Motivational Heterogeneity into Game-Theoretic Models of Collective Action|journal = Public Choice|volume = 117|issue = 3–4|pages = 295–314|publisher = |doi =10.1023/b:puch.0000003739.54365.fd |url = http://www.indiana.edu/~workshop/seminars/papers/ahnostromwalker_092402.pdf|accessdate = June 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hessel"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Oosterbeek|first1 = Hessel|last2 = Sloof|first2 = Randolph|last3 = Van de Kuilen|first3 = Gus|date = Dec 3, 2003|title = Cultural Differences in Ultimatum Game Experiments: Evidence from a Meta-Analysis|journal = Experimental Economics|volume = 7|issue = 2|pages = 171–88|publisher = Springer Science and Business Media B.V|doi = 10.1023/B:EXEC.0000026978.14316.74|url = http://www.econ.nagoya-cu.ac.jp/~yhamagu/ultimatum.pdf|accessdate = February 27, 2013|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130512175243/http://www.econ.nagoya-cu.ac.jp/~yhamagu/ultimatum.pdf|archivedate = May 12, 2013|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An extended "iterated" version of the game also exists. In this version, the classic game is played repeatedly between the same prisoners, who continuously have the opportunity to penalize the other for previous decisions. If the number of times the game will be played is known to the players, then (by [[backward induction]]) two classically rational players will betray each other repeatedly, for the same reasons as the single-shot variant. In an infinite or unknown length game there is no fixed optimum strategy, and prisoner's dilemma tournaments have been held to compete and test algorithms for such cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://egtheory.wordpress.com/2015/03/02/ipd/|title = Short history of iterated prisoner's dilemma tournaments|date = March 2, 2015|access-date = February 8, 2016|website = Theory, Evolution, and Games Group|publisher = |last = Kaznatcheev|first = Artem}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prisoner's dilemma game can be used as a model for many [[#Real-life examples|real world situations]] involving cooperative behavior. In casual usage, the label "prisoner's dilemma" may be applied to situations not strictly matching the formal criteria of the classic or iterative games: for instance, those in which two entities could gain important benefits from cooperating or suffer from the failure to do so, but find it difficult or expensive—not necessarily impossible—to coordinate their activities.

==Strategy for the prisoner's dilemma==

Two prisoners are separated into individual rooms and cannot communicate with each other.
The normal game is shown below:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! {{diagonal split header|&lt;br /&gt;Prisoner A|Prisoner B}} !! Prisoner B stays silent&lt;br&gt;(''cooperates'') !! Prisoner B betrays&lt;br&gt;(''defects'')
|-
! Prisoner A stays silent&lt;br&gt;(''cooperates'')
| Each serves 1 year|| Prisoner A: 3 years&lt;br /&gt;Prisoner B: goes free
|-
! Prisoner A betrays&lt;br&gt;(''defects'')
| Prisoner A: goes free&lt;br /&gt;Prisoner B: 3 years || Each serves 2 years
|}

It is assumed that both prisoners understand the nature of the game, have no loyalty to each other, and will have no opportunity for retribution or reward outside the game. Regardless of what the other decides, each prisoner gets a higher reward by betraying the other ("defecting"). The reasoning involves an argument by [[Dilemma#Use in logic|dilemma]]: B will either cooperate or defect. If B cooperates, A should defect, because going free is better than serving 1 year. If B defects, A should also defect, because serving 2 years is better than serving 3. So either way, A should defect. Parallel reasoning will show that B should defect.

Because defection always results in a better payoff than cooperation regardless of the other player's choice, it is a [[dominant strategy]]. Mutual defection is the only strong [[Nash equilibrium]] in the game (i.e. the only outcome from which each player could only do worse by unilaterally changing strategy). The dilemma, then, is that mutual cooperation yields a better outcome than mutual defection but is not the rational outcome because the choice to cooperate, from a self-interested perspective, is irrational.

==Generalized form==
The structure of the traditional Prisoner's Dilemma can be generalized from its original prisoner setting. Suppose that the two players are represented by the colors, red and blue, and that each player chooses to either "Cooperate" or "Defect".

If both players cooperate, they both receive the reward ''R'' for cooperating. If both players defect, they both receive the punishment payoff ''P''. If Blue defects while Red cooperates, then Blue receives the temptation payoff ''T'', while Red receives the "sucker's" payoff, ''S''. Similarly, if Blue cooperates while Red defects, then Blue receives the sucker's payoff ''S'', while Red receives the temptation payoff ''T''.

This can be expressed in [[Normal-form game|normal form]]:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|+ Canonical PD payoff matrix
! {{diagonal split header|{{color|#009|Blue}}|{{color|#900|Red}}}}
! scope="col" style="width:60px;" | {{color|#900|Cooperate}}
! scope="col" style="width:60px;" | {{color|#900|Defect}}
|-
! scope="row" style="width:60px;" | {{color|#009|Cooperate}}
| {{diagonal split header|{{color|#009|''R''}}|{{color|#900|''R''}}|transparent}}
| {{diagonal split header|{{color|#009|''S''}}|{{color|#900|''T''}}|transparent}}
|-
! scope="row" | {{color|#009|Defect}}
| {{diagonal split header|{{color|#009|''T''}}|{{color|#900|''S''}}|transparent}}
| {{diagonal split header|{{color|#009|''P''}}|{{color|#900|''P''}}|transparent}}
|}

and to be a prisoner's dilemma game in the strong sense, the following condition must hold for the payoffs:

:''T'' &gt; ''R'' &gt; ''P'' &gt; ''S''

The payoff relationship ''R'' &gt; ''P'' implies that mutual cooperation is superior to mutual defection, while the payoff relationships ''T'' &gt; ''R'' and ''P'' &gt; ''S'' imply that defection is the [[dominant strategy]] for both agents.

Note that {{tmath|2R&gt;T+S}} (i.e. {{tmath|2(b-c)&gt;b-c}}) which qualifies the donation game to be an iterated game (see next section).

The donation game may be applied to markets. Suppose X grows oranges, Y grows apples. The [[marginal utility]] of an apple to the orange-grower X is ''b'', which is higher than the marginal utility (''c'') of an orange, since X has a surplus of oranges and no apples. Similarly, for apple-grower Y, the marginal utility of an orange is ''b'' while the marginal utility of an apple is ''c''. If X and Y contract to exchange an apple and an orange, and each fulfills their end of the deal, then each receive a payoff of ''b''-''c''. If one "defects" and does not deliver as promised, the defector will receive a payoff of ''b'', while the cooperator will lose ''c''. If both defect, then neither one gains or loses anything.

==The iterated prisoner's dilemma==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2012}}
If two players play prisoner's dilemma more than once in succession and they remember previous actions of their opponent and change their strategy accordingly, the game is called iterated prisoner's dilemma.

In addition to the general form above, the iterative version also requires that 2''R'' &gt; ''T'' + ''S,'' to prevent alternating cooperation and defection giving a greater reward than mutual cooperation.

The iterated prisoner's dilemma game is fundamental to some theories of human cooperation and trust. On the assumption that the game can model transactions between two people requiring trust, cooperative behaviour in populations may be modeled by a multi-player, iterated, version of the game. It has, consequently, fascinated many scholars over the years. In 1975, Grofman and Pool estimated the count of scholarly articles devoted to it at over 2,000. The iterated prisoner's dilemma has also been referred to as the "[[Peace war game|Peace-War game]]".&lt;ref name = Shy&gt;{{cite book | title= Industrial Organization: Theory and Applications | publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology Press | first1= Oz | last1=Shy |url=https://books.google.com/?id=tr4CjJ5LlRcC&amp;pg=PR13&amp;dq=industrial+organization+theory+and+applications  | year=1995 | isbn=0262193663 | accessdate=February 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the game is played exactly ''N'' times and both players know this, then it is optimal to defect in all rounds. The only possible [[Nash equilibrium]] is to always defect. The proof is [[Mathematical induction|inductive]]: one might as well defect on the last turn, since the opponent will not have a chance to later retaliate. Therefore, both will defect on the last turn. Thus, the player might as well defect on the second-to-last turn, since the opponent will defect on the last no matter what is done, and so on.  The same applies if the game length is unknown but has a known upper limit.

Unlike the standard prisoner's dilemma, in the iterated prisoner's dilemma the defection strategy is counter-intuitive and fails badly to predict the behavior of human players. Within standard economic theory, though, this is the only correct answer.  The [[superrational]] strategy in the iterated prisoner's dilemma with fixed ''N'' is to cooperate against a superrational opponent, and in the limit of large ''N'', experimental results on strategies agree with the superrational version, not the game-theoretic rational one.

For cooperation to emerge between game theoretic rational players, the total number of rounds ''N'' must be unknown to the players. In this case 'always defect' may no longer be a strictly dominant strategy, only a Nash equilibrium. Amongst results shown by [[Robert Aumann]] in a 1959 paper, rational players repeatedly interacting for indefinitely long games can sustain the cooperative outcome.

===Strategy for the iterated prisoner's dilemma===
Interest in the iterated prisoner's dilemma (IPD) was kindled by [[Robert Axelrod]] in his book ''[[The Evolution of Cooperation]]'' (1984). In it he reports on a tournament he organized of the ''N'' step prisoner's dilemma (with ''N'' fixed) in which participants have to choose their mutual strategy again and again, and have memory of their previous encounters. Axelrod invited academic colleagues all over the world to devise computer strategies to compete in an IPD tournament. The programs that were entered varied widely in algorithmic complexity, initial hostility, capacity for forgiveness, and so forth.

Axelrod discovered that when these encounters were repeated over a long period of time with many players, each with different strategies, greedy strategies tended to do very poorly in the long run while more [[altruism|altruistic]] strategies did better, as judged purely by self-interest. He used this to show a possible mechanism for the evolution of altruistic behaviour from mechanisms that are initially purely selfish, by [[natural selection]].

The winning [[deterministic algorithm|deterministic]] strategy was [[tit for tat]], which [[Anatol Rapoport]] developed and entered into the tournament. It was the simplest of any program entered, containing only four lines of [[BASIC]], and won the contest. The strategy is simply to cooperate on the first iteration of the game; after that, the player does what his or her opponent did on the previous move. Depending on the situation, a slightly better strategy can be "tit for tat with forgiveness". When the opponent defects, on the next move, the player sometimes cooperates anyway, with a small probability (around 1–5%). This allows for occasional recovery from getting trapped in a cycle of defections. The exact probability depends on the line-up of opponents.

By analysing the top-scoring strategies, Axelrod stated several conditions necessary for a strategy to be successful.

; Nice: The most important condition is that the strategy must be "nice", that is, it will not defect before its opponent does (this is sometimes referred to as an "optimistic" algorithm). Almost all of the top-scoring strategies were nice; therefore, a purely selfish strategy will not "cheat" on its opponent, for purely self-interested reasons first.
; Retaliating: However, Axelrod contended, the successful strategy must not be a blind optimist. It must sometimes retaliate. An example of a non-retaliating strategy is Always Cooperate. This is a very bad choice, as "nasty" strategies will ruthlessly exploit such players.
; Forgiving: Successful strategies must also be forgiving. Though players will retaliate, they will once again fall back to cooperating if the opponent does not continue to defect. This stops long runs of revenge and counter-revenge, maximizing points.
; Non-envious: The last quality is being non-envious, that is not striving to score more than the opponent.

The optimal (points-maximizing) strategy for the one-time PD game is simply defection; as explained above, this is true whatever the composition of opponents may be. However, in the iterated-PD game the optimal strategy depends upon the strategies of likely opponents, and how they will react to defections and cooperations. For example, consider a population where everyone defects every time, except for a single individual following the tit for tat strategy. That individual is at a slight disadvantage because of the loss on the first turn. In such a population, the optimal strategy for that individual is to defect every time. In a population with a certain percentage of always-defectors and the rest being tit for tat players, the optimal strategy for an individual depends on the percentage, and on the length of the game.

In the strategy called Pavlov, [[win-stay, lose-switch]], faced with a failure to cooperate, the player switches strategy the next turn.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/93/7/2686.full.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  In certain circumstances,{{specify|date=November 2012}} Pavlov beats all other strategies by giving preferential treatment to co-players using a similar strategy.

Deriving the optimal strategy is generally done in two ways:
# [[Bayesian Nash equilibrium|Bayesian Nash Equilibrium]]: If the statistical distribution of opposing strategies can be determined (e.g. 50% tit for tat, 50% always cooperate) an optimal counter-strategy can be derived analytically.&lt;ref name="bne"&gt;For example see the 2003 study [http://econ.hevra.haifa.ac.il/~mbengad/seminars/whole1.pdf  "Bayesian Nash equilibrium; a statistical test of the hypothesis"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051002195142/http://econ.hevra.haifa.ac.il/~mbengad/seminars/whole1.pdf |date=2005-10-02 }} for discussion of the concept and whether it can apply in real [[economic]] or strategic situations (from [[Tel Aviv University]]).&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo]] simulations of populations have been made, where individuals with low scores die off, and those with high scores reproduce (a [[genetic algorithm]] for finding an optimal strategy). The mix of algorithms in the final population generally depends on the mix in the initial population. The introduction of mutation (random variation during reproduction) lessens the dependency on the initial population; empirical experiments with such systems tend to produce tit for tat players (see for instance Chess 1988),{{Clarify|date=August 2016}} but no analytic proof exists that this will always occur.

Although tit for tat is considered to be the most [[robust]] basic strategy, a team from [[Southampton University]] in England (led by [[Nick Jennings (computer scientist)|Professor Nicholas Jennings]] and consisting of Rajdeep Dash, Sarvapali Ramchurn, Alex Rogers, Perukrishnen Vytelingum) introduced a new strategy at the 20th-anniversary iterated prisoner's dilemma competition, which proved to be more successful than tit for tat. This strategy relied on collusion between programs to achieve the highest number of points for a single program. The university submitted 60 programs to the competition, which were designed to recognize each other through a series of five to ten moves at the start.&lt;ref name="southamptonstrategy"&gt;[http://www.southampton.ac.uk/mediacentre/news/2004/oct/04_151.shtml : University of Southampton&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421055745/http://www.southampton.ac.uk/mediacentre/news/2004/oct/04_151.shtml |date=2014-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once this recognition was made, one program would always cooperate and the other would always defect, assuring the maximum number of points for the defector. If the program realized that it was playing a non-Southampton player, it would continuously defect in an attempt to minimize the score of the competing program. As a result,&lt;ref name="southamptontrick"&gt;[http://www.prisoners-dilemma.com/results/cec04/ipd_cec04_full_run.html The 2004 Prisoners' Dilemma Tournament Results] show [[University of Southampton]]'s strategies in the first three places, despite having fewer wins and many more losses than the GRIM strategy. (Note that in a PD tournament, the aim of the game is not to "win" matches&amp;nbsp;– that can easily be achieved by frequent defection). It should also be pointed out that even without implicit collusion between [[computer program|software strategies]] (exploited by the Southampton team) tit for tat is not always the absolute winner of any given tournament; it would be more precise to say that its long run results over a series of tournaments outperform its rivals. (In any one event a given strategy can be slightly better adjusted to the competition than tit for tat, but tit for tat is more robust). The same applies for the tit for tat with forgiveness variant, and other optimal strategies: on any given day they might not 'win' against a specific mix of counter-strategies. An alternative way of putting it is using the Darwinian [[Evolutionarily stable strategy|ESS]] simulation. In such a simulation, tit for tat will almost always come to dominate, though nasty strategies will drift in and out of the population because a tit for tat population is penetrable by non-retaliating nice strategies, which in turn are easy prey for the nasty strategies. Richard Dawkins showed that here, no static mix of strategies form a stable equilibrium and the system will always oscillate between bounds.&lt;/ref&gt; this strategy ended up taking the top three positions in the competition, as well as a number of positions towards the bottom.

This strategy takes advantage of the fact that multiple entries were allowed in this particular competition and that the performance of a team was measured by that of the highest-scoring player (meaning that the use of self-sacrificing players was a form of [[minmaxing]]). In a competition where one has control of only a single player, tit for tat is certainly a better strategy. Because of this new rule, this competition also has little theoretical significance when analysing single agent strategies as compared to Axelrod's seminal tournament. However, it provided a basis for analysing how to achieve cooperative strategies in multi-agent frameworks, especially in the presence of noise. In fact, long before this new-rules tournament was played, [[Richard Dawkins]] in his book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' pointed out the possibility of such strategies winning if multiple entries were allowed, but he remarked that most probably Axelrod would not have allowed them if they had been submitted. It also relies on circumventing rules about the prisoner's dilemma in that there is no communication allowed between the two players, which the Southampton programs arguably did with their opening "ten move dance" to recognize one another; this only reinforces just how valuable communication can be in shifting the balance of the game.

===Stochastic iterated prisoner's dilemma===

In a stochastic iterated prisoner's dilemma game, strategies are specified by in terms of "cooperation probabilities".&lt;ref name=Press2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Press|first1=WH|last2=Dyson|first2=FJ|title=Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma contains strategies that dominate any evolutionary opponent|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]]|date=26 June 2012|volume=109|issue=26|pages=10409–13|doi=10.1073/pnas.1206569109|pmid=22615375|pmc=3387070|bibcode=2012PNAS..10910409P}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an encounter between player ''X'' and player ''Y'', ''X'' 's strategy is specified by a set of probabilities ''P'' of cooperating with ''Y''. ''P'' is a function of the outcomes of their previous encounters or some subset thereof. If ''P'' is a function of only their most recent ''n'' encounters, it is called a "memory-n" strategy. A memory-1 strategy is then specified by four cooperation probabilities:  &lt;math&gt;P=\{P_{cc},P_{cd},P_{dc},P_{dd}\}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;P_{ab}&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that ''X'' will cooperate in the present encounter given that the previous encounter was characterized by (ab). For example, if the previous encounter was one in which ''X'' cooperated and ''Y'' defected, then &lt;math&gt;P_{cd}&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that ''X'' will cooperate in the present encounter. If each of the probabilities are either 1 or 0, the strategy is called deterministic. An example of a deterministic strategy is the "[[tit for tat]]" strategy written as ''P''={1,0,1,0}, in which ''X'' responds as ''Y'' did in the previous encounter. Another is the [[win–stay, lose–switch]] strategy written as ''P''={1,0,0,1}, in which ''X'' responds as in the previous encounter, if it was a "win" (i.e. cc or dc) but changes strategy if it was a loss (i.e. cd or dd). It has been shown that for any memory-n strategy there is a corresponding memory-1 strategy which gives the same statistical results, so that only memory-1 strategies need be considered.&lt;ref name="Press2012"/&gt;

If we define ''P'' as the above 4-element strategy vector of ''X'' and &lt;math&gt;Q=\{Q_{cc},Q_{cd},Q_{dc},Q_{dd}\}&lt;/math&gt; as the 4-element strategy vector of ''Y'', a transition matrix ''M'' may be defined for ''X'' whose ''ij'' th entry is the probability that the outcome of a particular encounter between ''X'' and ''Y'' will be ''j'' given that the previous encounter was ''i'', where ''i'' and ''j'' are one of the four outcome indices: ''cc'', ''cd'', ''dc'', or ''dd''. For example, from ''X'' 's point of view, the probability that the outcome of the present encounter is ''cd'' given that the previous encounter was ''cd'' is equal to &lt;math&gt;M_{cd,cd}=P_{cd}(1-Q_{dc})&lt;/math&gt;. (Note that the indices for ''Q'' are from ''Y'' 's point of view: a ''cd'' outcome for ''X'' is a ''dc'' outcome for ''Y''.)  Under these definitions, the iterated prisoner's dilemma qualifies as a [[stochastic process]] and ''M'' is a [[stochastic matrix]], allowing all of the theory of stochastic processes to be applied.&lt;ref name="Press2012"/&gt;

One result of stochastic theory is that there exists a stationary vector ''v'' for the matrix ''M'' such that &lt;math&gt;v\cdot M=v&lt;/math&gt;. Without loss of generality, it may be specified that ''v'' is normalized so that the sum of its four components is unity. The ''ij'' th entry in &lt;math&gt;M^n&lt;/math&gt; will give the probability that the outcome of an encounter between ''X'' and ''Y'' will be ''j'' given that the encounter ''n'' steps previous is ''i''. In the limit as ''n'' approaches infinity, ''M'' will converge to a matrix with fixed values, giving the long-term probabilities of an encounter producing ''j'' which will be independent of ''i''. In other words, the rows of &lt;math&gt;M^\infty&lt;/math&gt; will be identical, giving the long-term equilibrium result probabilities of the iterated prisoners dilemma without the need to explicitly evaluate a large number of interactions. It can be seen that ''v'' is a stationary vector for &lt;math&gt;M^n&lt;/math&gt; and particularly &lt;math&gt;M^\infty&lt;/math&gt;, so that each row of &lt;math&gt;M^\infty&lt;/math&gt; will be equal to ''v''. Thus the stationary vector specifies the equilibrium outcome probabilities for ''X''. Defining &lt;math&gt;S_x=\{R,S,T,P\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_y=\{R,T,S,P\}&lt;/math&gt; as the short-term payoff vectors for the {cc,cd,dc,dd} outcomes (From ''X'' 's point of view), the equilibrium payoffs for ''X'' and ''Y'' can now be specified as &lt;math&gt;s_x=v\cdot S_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s_y=v\cdot S_y&lt;/math&gt;, allowing the two strategies ''P'' and ''Q'' to be compared for their long term payoffs.

====Zero-determinant strategies====

[[File:IPD Venn.svg|right|thumb|600px|The relationship between zero-determinant (ZD), cooperating and defecting strategies in the Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma (IPD) illustrated in a [[Venn diagram]]. Cooperating strategies always cooperate with other cooperating strategies, and defecting strategies always defect against other defecting strategies. Both contain subsets of strategies that are robust under strong selection, meaning no other memory-1 strategy is selected to invade such strategies when they are resident in a population. Only cooperating strategies contain a subset that are always robust, meaning that no other memory-1 strategy is selected to invade and replace such strategies, under both strong and [[weak selection]]. The intersection between ZD and good cooperating strategies is the set of generous ZD strategies. Extortion strategies are the intersection between ZD and non-robust defecting strategies. Tit-for-tat lies at the intersection of cooperating, defecting and ZD strategies.]]

In 2012, [[William H. Press]] and [[Freeman Dyson]] published a new class of strategies for the stochastic iterated prisoner's dilemma called "zero-determinant" (ZD) strategies.&lt;ref name="Press2012"/&gt; The long term payoffs for encounters between ''X'' and ''Y'' can be expressed as the determinant of a matrix which is a function of the two strategies and the short term payoff vectors: &lt;math&gt;s_x=D(P,Q,S_x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s_y=D(P,Q,S_y)&lt;/math&gt;, which do not involve the stationary vector ''v''. Since the determinant function &lt;math&gt;s_y=D(P,Q,f)&lt;/math&gt; is linear in ''f'', it follows that &lt;math&gt;\alpha s_x+\beta s_y+\gamma=D(P,Q,\alpha S_x+\beta S_y+\gamma U)&lt;/math&gt; (where ''U''={1,1,1,1}). Any strategies for which &lt;math&gt;D(P,Q,\alpha S_x+\beta S_y+\gamma U)=0&lt;/math&gt; is by definition a ZD strategy, and the long term payoffs obey the relation  &lt;math&gt;\alpha s_x+\beta s_y+\gamma=0&lt;/math&gt;.

Tit-for-tat is a ZD strategy which is "fair" in the sense of not gaining advantage over the other player. However, the ZD space also contains strategies that, in the case of two players, can allow one player to unilaterally set the other player's score or alternatively, force an evolutionary player to achieve a payoff some percentage lower than his own. The extorted player could defect but would thereby hurt himself by getting lower payoff. Thus, extortion solutions turn the iterated prisoner's dilemma into a sort of [[ultimatum game]]. Specifically, ''X'' is able to choose a strategy for which &lt;math&gt;D(P,Q,\beta S_y+\gamma U)=0&lt;/math&gt;, unilaterally setting &lt;math&gt;s_y&lt;/math&gt;  to a specific value within a particular range of values, independent of ''Y'' 's strategy, offering an opportunity for ''X'' to "extort" player ''Y'' (and vice versa). (It turns out that if ''X'' tries to set &lt;math&gt;s_x&lt;/math&gt; to a particular value, the range of possibilities is much smaller, only consisting of complete cooperation or complete defection.&lt;ref name="Press2012"/&gt;)

An extension of the IPD is an evolutionary stochastic IPD, in which the relative abundance of particular strategies is allowed to change, with more successful strategies relatively increasing. This process may be accomplished by having less successful players imitate the more successful strategies, or by eliminating less successful players from the game, while multiplying the more successful ones. It has been shown that unfair ZD strategies are not [[evolutionarily stable strategy|evolutionarily stable]]. The key intuition is that an evolutionarily stable strategy must not only be able to invade another population (which extortionary ZD strategies can do) but must also perform well against other players of the same type (which extortionary ZD players do poorly, because they reduce each other's surplus).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adami|first=Christoph|author2=Arend Hintze|title=Evolutionary instability of Zero Determinant strategies demonstrates that winning isn't everything|year=2013|page=3|arxiv=1208.2666|doi=10.1038/ncomms3193|bibcode=2013NatCo...4E2193A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theory and simulations confirm that beyond a critical population size, ZD extortion loses out in evolutionary competition against more cooperative strategies, and as a result, the average payoff in the population increases when the population is bigger. In addition, there are some cases in which extortioners may even catalyze cooperation by helping to break out of a face-off between uniform defectors and [[win–stay, lose–switch]] agents.&lt;ref name=Hilbe2013 /&gt;

While extortionary ZD strategies are not stable in large populations, another ZD class called "generous" strategies ''is'' both stable and robust.  In fact, when the population is not too small, these strategies can supplant any other ZD strategy and even perform well against a broad array of generic strategies for iterated prisoner's dilemma, including win–stay, lose–switch. This was proven specifically for the [[Prisoner's dilemma#Special case: Donation game|donation game]] by Alexander Stewart and Joshua Plotkin in 2013.&lt;ref name=Stewart2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stewart|first=Alexander J.|author2=Joshua B. Plotkin|title=From extortion to generosity, evolution in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]]|year=2013|doi=10.1073/pnas.1306246110|volume=110|issue=38|pages=15348–53|bibcode=2013PNAS..11015348S|pmc=3780848}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generous strategies will cooperate with other cooperative players, and in the face of defection, the generous player loses more utility than its rival. Generous strategies are the intersection of ZD strategies and so-called "good" strategies, which were defined by Akin (2013)&lt;ref name=Akin2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Akin|first=Ethan|title=Stable Cooperative Solutions for the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma|year=2013|page=9|arxiv=1211.0969|bibcode=2012arXiv1211.0969A}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be those for which the player responds to past mutual cooperation with future cooperation and splits expected payoffs equally if he receives at least the cooperative expected payoff. Among good strategies, the generous (ZD) subset performs well when the population is not too small. If the population is very small, defection strategies tend to dominate.&lt;ref name=Stewart2013 /&gt;

===Continuous iterated prisoner's dilemma===
Most work on the iterated prisoner's dilemma has focused on the discrete case, in which players either cooperate or defect, because this model is relatively simple to analyze. However, some researchers have looked at models of the continuous iterated prisoner's dilemma, in which players are able to make a variable contribution to the other player. Le and Boyd&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Le | first1 = S. | last2 = Boyd | first2 = R. |name-list-format=vanc| year = 2007 | title = Evolutionary Dynamics of the Continuous Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma | url = | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 245 | issue = 2| pages = 258–67 | doi = 10.1016/j.jtbi.2006.09.016 | pmid = 17125798 }}&lt;/ref&gt; found that in such situations, cooperation is much harder to evolve than in the discrete iterated prisoner's dilemma. The basic intuition for this result is straightforward: in a continuous prisoner's dilemma, if a population starts off in a non-cooperative equilibrium, players who are only marginally more cooperative than non-cooperators get little benefit from [[assorting]] with one another. By contrast, in a discrete prisoner's dilemma, tit for tat cooperators get a big payoff boost from assorting with one another in a non-cooperative equilibrium, relative to non-cooperators. Since nature arguably offers more opportunities for variable cooperation rather than a strict dichotomy of cooperation or defection, the continuous prisoner's dilemma may help explain why real-life examples of tit for tat-like cooperation are extremely rare in nature (ex. Hammerstein&lt;ref&gt;Hammerstein, P. (2003). Why is reciprocity so rare in social animals? A protestant appeal. In: P. Hammerstein, Editor, Genetic and Cultural Evolution of Cooperation, MIT Press. pp. 83–94.
&lt;/ref&gt;) even though tit for tat seems robust in theoretical models.

===Emergence of stable strategies===
Players cannot seem to coordinate mutual cooperation, thus often get locked into the inferior yet stable strategy of defection.  In this way, iterated rounds facilitate the evolution of stable strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spaniel|first=William|title=Game Theory 101: The Complete Textbook|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iterated rounds often produce novel strategies, which have implications to complex social interaction. One such strategy is win-stay lose-shift. This strategy outperforms a simple Tit-For-Tat strategy&amp;nbsp;– that is, if you can get away with cheating, repeat that behavior, however if you get caught, switch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nowak|first=Martin|author2=Karl Sigmund|title=A strategy of win-stay, lose-shift that outperforms tit-for-tat in the Prisoner's Dilemma game|journal=Nature|year=1993|volume=364|issue=6432|doi=10.1038/364056a0|pages=56–58|pmid=8316296|bibcode=1993Natur.364...56N}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only problem of this tit-for-tat strategy is that they are vulnerable to signal error. The problem arises when one individual shows cooperative behavior but the other interprets it as cheating. As a result of this, the second individual now cheats and then it starts a see-saw pattern of cheating in a chain reaction.

==Real-life examples==
The prisoner setting may seem contrived, but there are in fact many examples in human interaction as well as interactions in nature that have the same payoff matrix. The prisoner's dilemma is therefore of interest to the [[social science]]s such as [[economics]], [[politics]], and [[sociology]], as well as to the biological sciences such as [[ethology]] and [[evolutionary biology]]. Many natural processes have been abstracted into models in which living beings are engaged in endless games of prisoner's dilemma. This wide applicability of the PD gives the game its substantial importance.

===In environmental studies===
In [[environmental studies]], the PD is evident in crises such as global [[climate change|climate-change]]. It is argued all countries will benefit from a stable climate, but any single country is often hesitant to curb [[Carbon dioxide|{{Co2}}]] emissions. The immediate benefit to any one country from maintaining current behavior is wrongly perceived to be greater than the purported eventual benefit to that country if all countries' behavior was changed, therefore explaining the impasse concerning climate-change in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Economist]]|url=http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9867020|title=Markets &amp; Data|date=2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important difference between climate-change politics and the prisoner's dilemma is uncertainty; the extent and pace at which pollution can change climate is not known. The dilemma faced by government is therefore different from the prisoner's dilemma in that the payoffs of cooperation are unknown. This difference suggests that states will cooperate much less than in a real iterated prisoner's dilemma, so that the probability of avoiding a possible climate catastrophe is much smaller than that suggested by a game-theoretical analysis of the situation using a real iterated prisoner's dilemma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rehmeyer|first=Julie|title=Game theory suggests current climate negotiations won't avert catastrophe|url=https://www.sciencenews.org/article/game-theory-suggests-current-climate-negotiations-won%E2%80%99t-avert-catastrophe|work=Science News|publisher=Society for Science &amp; the Public|date=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Osang and Nandy provide a theoretical explanation with proofs for a regulation-driven win-win situation along the
lines of [[Michael Porter]]'s hypothesis, in which government regulation of competing firms is substantial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.smu.edu/tosang/pdf/regln0803.pdf Osang and Nandy 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

===In animals===
Cooperative behavior of many animals can be understood as an example of the prisoner's dilemma. Often animals engage in long term partnerships, which can be more specifically modeled as iterated prisoner's dilemma. For example, [[guppy|guppies]] inspect predators cooperatively in groups, and they are thought to punish non-cooperative inspectors.

[[Vampire bats]] are social animals that engage in reciprocal food exchange. Applying the payoffs from the prisoner's dilemma can help explain this behavior:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|title=The Selfish Gene|year=1976|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* C/C: "Reward: I get blood on my unlucky nights, which saves me from starving. I have to give blood on my lucky nights, which doesn't cost me too much."
* D/C: "Temptation: You save my life on my poor night. But then I get the added benefit of not having to pay the slight cost of feeding you on my good night."
* C/D: "Sucker's Payoff: I pay the cost of saving your life on my good night. But on my bad night you don't feed me and I run a real risk of starving to death."
* D/D: "Punishment: I don't have to pay the slight costs of feeding you on my good nights. But I run a real risk of starving on my poor nights."

===In psychology===
In [[addiction]] research / [[behavioral economics]], [[George Ainslie (psychologist)|George Ainslie]] points out&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=George|last=Ainslie |title=Breakdown of Will |year=2001 |isbn=0-521-59694-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; that addiction can be cast as an intertemporal PD problem between the present and future selves of the addict.  In this case, ''defecting'' means ''relapsing'', and it is easy to see that not defecting both today and in the future is by far the best outcome. The case where one abstains today but relapses in the future is the worst outcome&amp;nbsp;– in some sense the discipline and self-sacrifice involved in abstaining today have been "wasted" because the future relapse means that the addict is right back where he started and will have to start over (which is quite demoralizing, and makes starting over more difficult).  Relapsing today and tomorrow is a slightly "better" outcome, because while the addict is still addicted, they haven't put the effort in to trying to stop. The final case, where one engages in the addictive behavior today while abstaining "tomorrow" will be familiar to anyone who has struggled with an addiction.  The problem here is that (as in other PDs) there is an obvious benefit to defecting "today", but tomorrow one will face the same PD, and the same obvious benefit will be present then, ultimately leading to an endless string of defections.

[[John Gottman]] in his research described in "the science of trust" defines good relationships as those where partners know not to enter the (D,D) cell or at least not to get dynamically stuck there in a loop.

===In economics===
Advertising is sometimes cited as a real-example of the prisoner’s dilemma.  When [[cigarette advertising]] was legal in the United States, competing cigarette manufacturers had to decide how much money to spend on advertising.  The effectiveness of Firm A’s advertising was partially determined by the advertising conducted by Firm B.  Likewise, the profit derived from advertising for Firm B is affected by the advertising conducted by Firm A.  If both Firm A and Firm B chose to advertise during a given period, then the advertising cancels out, receipts remain constant, and expenses increase due to the cost of advertising.  Both firms would benefit from a reduction in advertising.  However, should Firm B choose not to advertise, Firm A could benefit greatly by advertising. Nevertheless, the optimal amount of advertising by one firm depends on how much advertising the other undertakes. As the best strategy is dependent on what the other firm chooses there is no dominant strategy, which makes it slightly different from a prisoner's dilemma. The outcome is similar, though, in that both firms would be better off were they to advertise less than in the equilibrium. Sometimes cooperative behaviors do emerge in business situations.  For instance, cigarette manufacturers endorsed the making of laws banning cigarette advertising, understanding that this would reduce costs and increase profits across the industry.{{Citation needed|reason=This reference doesn't mention or support the claimed historical account.|date=December 2012}}&lt;ref name="trust"&gt;This argument for the development of cooperation through trust is given in '' [[The Wisdom of Crowds]] '', where it is argued that long-distance [[capitalism]] was able to form around a nucleus of [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]], who always dealt honourably with their business partners. (Rather than defecting and reneging on promises&amp;nbsp;– a phenomenon that had discouraged earlier long-term unenforceable overseas contracts). It is argued that dealings with reliable merchants allowed the [[meme]] for cooperation to spread to other traders, who spread it further until a high degree of cooperation became a profitable strategy in general [[commerce]]&lt;/ref&gt;  This analysis is likely to be pertinent in many other business situations involving advertising.{{Citation needed|reason=This doesn't sound like cooperation|date=November 2012}}

Without enforceable agreements, members of a [[cartel]] are also involved in a (multi-player) prisoner's dilemma.&lt;ref name=NicholsonIntermediateMicroEd8&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Nicholson|first=Walter|authorlink=Walter Nicholson|year=2000|title=Intermediate Microeconomics|edition=8th|publisher=Harcourt}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Cooperating' typically means keeping prices at a pre-agreed minimum level. 'Defecting' means selling under this minimum level, instantly taking business (and profits) from other cartel members. [[Anti-trust]] authorities want potential cartel members to mutually defect, ensuring the lowest possible prices for [[consumer]]s.

===In sport===
[[Doping in sport]] has been cited as an example of a prisoner's dilemma.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite web|last=Schneier |first=Bruce |url=https://www.wired.com/opinion/2012/10/lance-armstrong-and-the-prisoners-dilemma-of-doping-in-professional-sports/ |title=Lance Armstrong and the Prisoners' Dilemma of Doping in Professional Sports &amp;#124; Wired Opinion |publisher=Wired.com |date=2012-10-26 |accessdate=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two competing athletes have the option to use an illegal and/or dangerous drug to boost their performance. If neither athlete takes the drug, then neither gains an advantage. If only one does, then that athlete gains a significant advantage over their competitor, reduced by the legal and/or medical dangers of having taken the drug. If both athletes take the drug, however, the benefits cancel out and only the dangers remain, putting them both in a worse position than if neither had used doping.&lt;ref name="wired" /&gt;

===In international politics===
In [[international politics|international political theory]], the Prisoner's Dilemma is often used to demonstrate the coherence of [[strategic realism]], which holds that in international relations, all states (regardless of their internal policies or professed ideology), will act in their rational self-interest given [[anarchy (international relations)|international anarchy]]. A classic example is an arms race like the [[Cold War]] and similar conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0165489684900222 | title = Arms races as iterated prisoner's dilemma games | author = Stephen J. Majeski | journal = Mathematical and Social Sciences | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 253–66 | year = 1984 | doi=10.1016/0165-4896(84)90022-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Cold War the opposing alliances of [[NATO]] and the [[Warsaw Pact]] both had the choice to arm or disarm. From each side's point of view, disarming whilst their opponent continued to arm would have led to military inferiority and possible annihilation. Conversely, arming whilst their opponent disarmed would have led to superiority. If both sides chose to arm, neither could afford to attack the other, but both incurred the high cost of developing and maintaining a nuclear arsenal. If both sides chose to disarm, war would be avoided and there would be no costs.

Although the 'best' overall outcome is for both sides to disarm, the rational course for both sides is to arm, and this is indeed what happened. Both sides poured enormous resources into military research and armament in a [[War of attrition (game)|war of attrition]] for the next thirty years until the Soviet Union could not withstand the economic cost.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} The same logic could be applied in any similar scenario, be it economic or technological competition between sovereign states.

===Multiplayer dilemmas===
Many real-life dilemmas involve multiple players.&lt;ref&gt;Gokhale CS, Traulsen A. Evolutionary games in the multiverse. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 2010 Mar 23. 107(12):5500–04.&lt;/ref&gt; Although metaphorical, [[Garrett Hardin|Hardin's]] [[tragedy of the commons]] may be viewed as an example of a multi-player generalization of the PD: Each villager makes a choice for personal gain or restraint. The collective reward for unanimous (or even frequent) defection is very low payoffs (representing the destruction of the "commons"). A commons dilemma most people can relate to is washing the dishes in a shared house.  By not washing dishes an individual can gain by saving his time, but if that behavior is adopted by every resident the collective cost is no clean plates for anyone.

The commons are not always exploited: [[William Poundstone]], in a book about the prisoner's dilemma (see References below), describes a situation in New Zealand where newspaper boxes are left unlocked. It is possible for people to [[Excludability|take a paper without paying]] (''defecting'') but very few do, feeling that if they do not pay then neither will others, destroying the system. Subsequent research by [[Elinor Ostrom]], winner of the 2009 Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, hypothesized that the [[tragedy of the commons]] is oversimplified, with the negative outcome influenced by outside influences. Without complicating pressures, groups communicate and manage the commons among themselves for their mutual benefit, enforcing social norms to preserve the resource and achieve the maximum good for the group, an example of effecting the best case outcome for PD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://volokh.com/2009/10/12/elinor-ostrom-and-the-tragedy-of-the-commons/ |title=The Volokh Conspiracy " Elinor Ostrom and the Tragedy of the Commons |publisher=Volokh.com |date=2009-10-12 |accessdate=2011-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Closed-bag exchange===
[[File:Prisoner's Dilemma briefcase exchange (colorized).svg|thumb|The prisoner's dilemma as a briefcase exchange]]
[[Douglas Hofstadter]]&lt;ref name="dh"&gt;{{cite book | first=Douglas R. | last=Hofstadter| authorlink=Douglas Hofstadter | title= [[Metamagical Themas]]: questing for the essence of mind and pattern | publisher= Bantam Dell Pub Group| year=1985 | isbn=0-465-04566-9|chapter= Ch.29 ''The Prisoner's Dilemma Computer Tournaments and the Evolution of Cooperation''.}}&lt;/ref&gt; once suggested that people often find problems such as the PD problem easier to understand when it is illustrated in the form of a simple game, or trade-off. One of several examples he used was "closed bag exchange":
{{quote|Two people meet and exchange closed bags, with the understanding that one of them contains money, and the other contains a purchase. Either player can choose to honor the deal by putting into his or her bag what he or she agreed, or he or she can defect by handing over an empty bag.}}

In this game, defection always gives a game-theoretically preferable outcome.

===''Friend or Foe?''===
''[[Friend or Foe? (TV series)|Friend or Foe?]]'' is a game show that aired from 2002 to 2005 on the [[Game Show Network]] in the US.  It is an example of the prisoner's dilemma game tested on real people, but in an artificial setting. On the game show, three pairs of people compete. When a pair is eliminated, they play a game similar to the prisoner's dilemma to determine how the winnings are split. If they both cooperate (Friend), they share the winnings 50–50. If one cooperates and the other defects (Foe), the defector gets all the winnings and the cooperator gets nothing. If both defect, both leave with nothing. Notice that the reward matrix is slightly different from the standard one given above, as the rewards for the "both defect" and the "cooperate while the opponent defects" cases are identical. This makes the "both defect" case a weak equilibrium, compared with being a strict equilibrium in the standard prisoner's dilemma. If a contestant knows that their opponent is going to vote "Foe", then their own choice does not affect their own winnings. In a specific sense, ''Friend or Foe'' has a rewards model between prisoner's dilemma and the [[Chicken (game)|game of Chicken]].

The rewards matrix is
{| class="wikitable"

This payoff matrix has also been used on the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[television]] programmes ''Trust Me'', ''[[Shafted]]'', ''[[The Bank Job (TV series)|The Bank Job]]'' and ''[[Golden Balls]]'', and on the [[United States|American]] shows ''[[Bachelor Pad]]'' and ''[[Take It All (game show)|Take It All]]''. Game data from the ''[[Golden Balls]]'' series has been analyzed by a team of economists, who found that cooperation was "surprisingly high" for amounts of money that would seem consequential in the real world, but were comparatively low in the context of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | ssrn=1592456 | title=Split or Steal?

===Iterated snowdrift===
Researchers from the [[University of Lausanne]] and the [[University of Edinburgh]] have suggested that the "Iterated Snowdrift Game" may more closely reflect real-world social situations. Although this model is actually a [[chicken game]], it will be described here. In this model, the risk of being exploited through defection is lower, and individuals always gain from taking the cooperative choice. The snowdrift game imagines two drivers who are stuck on opposite sides of a [[snowdrift]], each of whom is given the option of shoveling snow to clear a path, or remaining in their car. A player's highest payoff comes from leaving the opponent to clear all the snow by themselves, but the opponent is still nominally rewarded for their work.

This may better reflect real world scenarios, the researchers giving the example of two scientists collaborating on a report, both of whom would benefit if the other worked harder. "But when your collaborator doesn’t do any work, it’s probably better for you to do all the work yourself. You’ll still end up with a completed project."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kümmerli|first=Rolf|title='Snowdrift' game tops 'Prisoner's Dilemma' in explaining cooperation|url=http://phys.org/news111145481.html|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==
[[Hannu Rajaniemi]] set the opening scene of his ''[[The Quantum Thief]]'' trilogy in a "dilemma prison". The main theme of the series has been described as the "inadequacy of a binary universe" and the ultimate antagonist is a character called the All-Defector.  Rajaniemi is particularly interesting as an artist treating this subject in that he is a Cambridge-trained mathematician and holds a PhD in [[mathematical physics]]&amp;nbsp;– the interchangeability of matter and information is a major feature of the books, which take place in a "post-singularity" future.  The first book in the series was published in 2010, with the two sequels, ''[[The Fractal Prince]]'' and ''[[The Causal Angel]]'', published in 2012 and 2014, respectively.

A game modeled after the (iterated) prisoner's dilemma is a central focus of the 2012 video game ''[[Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward]]'' and a minor part in its 2016 sequel ''[[Zero Escape: Zero Time Dilemma]]''.

In ''The Mysterious Benedict Society and the Prisoner's Dilemma'' by [[Trenton Lee Stewart]], the main characters start by playing a version of the game and escaping from the "prison" altogether. Later they become actual prisoners and escape once again.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3922">A '''route card''' is a document that is used by [[hillwalker]]s as an aid to [[navigation]] and route planning.  The military also use a similar technique for planning night marches and/or [[patrol]]s.

== Core information: The planned route ==

The planned route is broken down into discrete sections termed "legs" or "stages".   Whenever possible, each leg will start and finish at a clearly defined topographical feature such as a [[lake]], [[Hillock|knoll]], saddle, [[stream]] junction and so on.  In most cases the legs are defined as being the longest section that might be safely followed on a single [[compass]] bearing.  The object is to split the overall route into sections that can be readily undertaken in conditions of poor visibility such as in [[cloud]], [[fog]] or at night.

In addition to the compass bearing, for each leg the total distance will be measured as well as the height gained or lost and the steepness of the ground. Using this information an estimated time to complete the leg will be calculated usually using [[Naismith's Rule]] or one of its variations.  These times are then added to estimate the total time needed for the expedition.

For each leg note may also be taken of potential sources of danger along the route such as [[cliff]]s or of handrail/collecting features to aid in confirming the route.

== Additional information ==

For formal expeditions or excursions the leader may include the following information.

*composition of the party with the names of the members, car registration numbers.
*actual start time and date.
*estimated time and date of arrival at finish.
*mobile [[telephone]] number and/or [[radio]] frequencies in use
*notes regarding special equipment carried, [[tent]]s, emergency shelters, food etc.

A copy of the route card is then left with a responsible person so as to assist the emergency services in the event that the group should suffer a mishap.  This also avoids groups being reported as missing prematurely or without due cause.

== Use of route cards ==

In typical use, the route card will not be followed exactly by the party leader but is used as a backup if conditions deteriorate.  When following legs on a compass bearing, the estimated time is not usually used as a precise indicator of when the leg is over but as a kind of fail-safe to stop the group from overshooting the actual objective and getting lost.  If a precise estimate is needed, pace-counting may be used instead if terrain permits.  Nowadays, it is typical to enter the co-ordinates from the route card into a handheld [[GPS]] unit and use this in conjunction with a compass if conditions deteriorate.  In some cases, each member of the expedition may memorize a section of the route and have their own compass preset to the relevant bearing.  This is a particular technique for military night patrols where the [[soldier]]s each lead a section of the route.

== Use of Moon route cards ==

Military use these to assist a planned route for night navigation same as a route card.

It is very simply a route card just showing the legs or stages of the route. Some commanders have a full detailed route card as well as the moon route card when doing night navigation. 

The two reasons for this is that you can pull the Moon card out on the march and hold it up to the moon light to check the bearing or grid reference of the next leg, and to stop you getting out your torch and giving your position away.

A '''sandplain''' is an area where the soil is sand deposited from elsewhere by processes such as wind or ocean, rather than direct weathering of [[bedrock]].

Sandplains are quite flat. There may be [[dune]] systems, and given time and the right conditions these may form [[eolianite]] ridges, but other than that there is little to give a sandplain any [[topography|topographical]] character.

Inland sandplains are often extremely infertile, because the sand is often low in nutrients when deposited, plus the good drainage means any nutrients are rapidly [[leaching (pedology)|leached]] away.

Coastal sandplains in [[intertidal zone]]s like those seen in the [[Wadden Sea]] in western Europe for example, are wet with nutrients added continuously, so they can often support a very rich and important fauna of birds, worms, [[mussel]]s, etc..

In North America, sandplains are often vegetated by [[pine barrens]]. In Western Australia, [[kwongan]] is the dominant vegetation.

[[Image:Rivinletto Light.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Rivinletto Light]] on Kaasanmatala rock at the mouth of [[Kiiminkijoki]] in [[Haukipudas]], [[Finland]] is a typical sector light beacon.]][[Image:Leitfeuer_001.svg|thumb|Example of a sector light. The ship is navigating in the safe sector (white light is commonly marked as yellow in nautical charts).]]

A '''sector light''' is a man-made [[pilotage]] and [[position fixing]] aid that consists of strictly de-limited horizontal angle light beams to guide water-borne traffic through a safe channel at night in reasonable visibility. Sector lights are most often used for safe passage through shallow or dangerous waters. This may be when leaving or entering harbour. Nautical charts (paper and electronic) give all the required information.

Sectors of colored glass (or plastic) are placed in the lanterns of these lights. The light will then show these colors when observed certain bearings. Bearings referring to a sector are given in degrees true as observed from sea. Though the colors of the light will change, the characteristics will not. The change of color is not abrupt. The transition is made through an arc of uncertainty of 2° or greater.

The colors that are used, are conform to the IALA Maritime Bouyage system that is designed by the [[International Association of Lighthouse Authorities]]:
* white - this sector is in the middle of the safe channel
* red - indicates the [[port (nautical)|port]] edge of the channel for vessels approaching the light source
* green - indicates the [[starboard]] edge of the channel for vessels approaching the light source.
A ship that is sailing in safe water and then sees the red (or green) color of the light has to make an alteration in course.

The world has different navigation stereotypes managed by IALA (International Association of Lighthouse Authorities). For example, the United States uses a signalling stereotype which is the opposite of Europe. In USA, the red light indicates the starboard side of the channel for harbour bound vessels, while the green light indicates the port side of the same channel. An expression to remind of this is "red right returning".
[[File:Diego Garcia PEL.jpg|thumb|Diego Garcia PEL Sector Light. 3.5 million candela which is visible for over 18.5km by day. Total beam width of 1.6° with white sector of 0.2°.]]

== Example of a sector light ==
An example of a sector light is the light of the [[Fisgard Lighthouse National Historic Site|Fisgard Lighthouse]] in [[British Columbia]]. The lighthouse as built to guide ships through the entrance of Esquimalt harbour. The white sector is an isophase light of 2s from 322° to 195°. If the ship sees this white light, it can pass safely. The rest shows a red light from 195 to 322°. If a vessel sees this light, it should alter its course.

Another example is the [[PEL sector light]] at [[Diego Garcia]]. The PEL sector light was constructed to guide US Navy vessels into the Diego Garcia port through a narrow entrance in the lagoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.msc.navy.mil/sealift/2003/March/diegogarcia.htm|title = US Navy Military Sealift Command|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The PEL sector light produces 3.5 million candela and is visible for 10 nautical miles (18.5&amp;nbsp;km) by day. The beam with 3 colors is narrow at 1.6°.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://vega.co.nz/price-list/gallery/case-study-diego-garcia/|title = PEL-6 Diego Garcia|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was required because the PEL sector light was built over 7NM (13&amp;nbsp;km) from the atoll entrance and it had to illuminate a safe entrance which is only 228 meters wide.

A geographical '''state vector''' is a set of data describing exactly where an object is located in space, and how it is moving.  From a state vector, and sufficient mathematical conditions (e.g. the [[Picard-Lindelöf theorem|Picard-Lindelöf]] theorem), the object's past and future position can be determined.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

A geographical state vector typically will contain seven elements: three [[position (vector)|position]] coordinates, three [[velocity]] terms, and the [[time]] at which these values were valid.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} Mathematically, if we are to describe positions in a N-dimensional space (&lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^N &lt;/math&gt;) then a state vector &lt;math&gt; \textbf{x} &lt;/math&gt; belongs to &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^{2N}&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}(t) = ( x_1(t)\;\; x_2 (t)\; \;x_3(t)\; \;v_1(t) \;\;v_2 (t) \;\;v_3 (t))^T &lt;/math&gt;

or simply

&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}(t) = \binom{\mathbf{r}(t)}{\mathbf{v}(t)}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{r} = (x_1\;x_2\;x_3)^T&lt;/math&gt; is the position vector and &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v} = \dot{\mathbf{r}} = (v_1\;v_2\;v_3)^T&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity vector.

Due to the freedom one has in choosing coordinate systems for position, a state vector may also be expressed in a variety of [[coordinate system]]s (e.g. the [[North east down]] coordinate system).

The '''Travellers Club''' is a private [[gentlemen's club]] situated at 106 [[Pall Mall, London|Pall Mall]] in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]]. It is the oldest of the surviving [[List of gentlemen's clubs in London|Pall Mall clubs]] and one of the most exclusive, having been established in 1819. It was described as "the [[quintessential English]] gentleman's club" by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2004/nov/07/travel/tr-spano7 Touring the manly realm of London's Travellers Club] Los Angeles Times, November 7, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The original concept of the club, by [[Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh|Lord Castlereagh]] and others, dates from the conclusion of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. They envisaged a club where gentlemen who travelled abroad might meet and offer hospitality to distinguished foreign visitors. The original rules of 1819 excluded from membership anyone ''“who has not travelled out of the British islands to a distance of at least five hundred miles from London in a direct line”''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianlondon.org/entertainment/travellersclub.htm|title=Victorian London - Entertainment and Recreation - Clubs - Travellers Club; (Peter Cunningham, Hand-Book of London, 1850)|website=www.victorianlondon.org|accessdate=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
The members of the club's first Committee included the [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Earl of Aberdeen]] (later Prime Minister), [[George Eden, 1st Earl of Auckland|Lord Auckland]] (after whom [[Auckland]], New Zealand is named), the [[Henry Petty-FitzMaurice, 3rd Marquess of Lansdowne|Marquess of Lansdowne]] (who had already served as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] and later refused office as Prime Minister) and [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Viscount Palmerston]] (later Foreign Secretary and Prime Minister).

Subsequent members included statesmen and travellers such as Prime Minister [[George Canning]],&lt;ref name=TCH&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Club History and Building| work =| publisher =The Travellers Club| date =| url =http://www.thetravellersclub.org.uk/club/| doi =| accessdate =2008-09-23| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20080726164615/http://www.thetravellersclub.org.uk/club/| archivedate =2008-07-26| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|the Duke of Wellington]],&lt;ref name=TCH /&gt; [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]], Prime Minister [[Arthur Balfour]],&lt;ref name=TCH /&gt; Prime Minister [[Stanley Baldwin]],&lt;ref name=TCH /&gt; Prime Minister [[Alec Douglas-Home]], [[Francis Beaufort]]&lt;ref name=TCH /&gt; (creator of the [[Beaufort scale]]), [[Robert FitzRoy]] of [[HMS Beagle|HMS ''Beagle'']],&lt;ref name=TCH /&gt; Sir [[William Edward Parry]]&lt;ref name=TCH /&gt; (explorer of the [[Northwest Passage]]), Sir [[Roderick Murchison]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} (after whom the [[Murchison crater]] on the [[Moon]] is named) and Sir [[Wilfred Thesiger]].&lt;ref name=TCH /&gt; Novelist [[Anthony Powell]] was a member, and the club is featured in various guises in the work of [[Graham Greene]], [[Jules Verne]], [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] and John le Carré.

The club's members include members of the British and foreign royal families, the [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|British Foreign Secretary]] whilst in office, and various ambassadors to London; a tradition still continued today and there is also a special category of membership for particularly distinguished travellers, explorers and travel writers. Such well-known current members include Field Marshal [[Edwin Bramall|Lord Bramall]],{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} and [[Terry Waite]].&lt;ref name=TGP&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4718049/So-what-should-an-English-gentleman-do.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=So what should an English gentleman do? | date=1999-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its membership remains exclusive, although there are a number of connections with other clubs throughout the world whose members may use its premises from time to time.&lt;ref&gt;Club Guide Accessed May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Justin Welby]], the Archbishop of Canterbury, announced in 2014 that he would resign from the club, owing to its refusal to admit women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/10972976/Archbishop-of-Canterbury-will-quit-gentlemens-club-that-voted-against-female-members.html|title=Archbishop of Canterbury will quit gentlemen's club that voted against female members|first=Raziye|last=Akkoc|date=17 July 2014|publisher=|accessdate=25 May 2018|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Premises==
The club's original premises were at 12 Waterloo Place. It moved to 49 Pall Mall in 1821 (a building which had once been occupied by [[Brooks's]]). However, it quickly outgrew this building and in 1826 the members decided to spend £25,000 on the construction of a purpose built club house on the present site at 106 Pall Mall, backing onto Carlton gardens.

The architect was Sir [[Charles Barry]] who was later to be the architect for the [[Houses of Parliament]], and the Travellers Club building proved to be one of his masterpieces. It takes the form of a [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] palace which is said to have been inspired by [[Raphael]]'s Palazzo Pandolfini in Florence. It was completed in 1832, with the tower (which had been in Barry's original design) added in 1842.

The club building includes a smoking room (a large common room which looks over Carlton Gardens), the cocktail bar and adjacent Bramall room (which gives access to [[Carlton House Terrace#Carlton Gardens|Carlton Gardens]]), the Outer Morning Room (a large drawing room overlooking Pall Mall, and connecting to an Inner Morning Room), and the dining room (known as the Coffee Room). ''[[The Times]]'' on 10 January 2004 noted ''"the wonderful dining, heavy on fish and game (partridges to [[potted shrimps]]) with echoes of public school food (bread pudding) and a superb wine cellar"''.

The magnificent library is decorated with a cast of the [[Bassae Frieze]] from the 5th century BCE [[Greek temple]] of Apollo Epicurius at [[Bassae]]. The originals of this frieze were discovered by the architect [[Charles Robert Cockerell]], who was on the first Committee of the Club in 1819, and they are now in the [[British Museum]]. The library has a large and important collection of books, from the antiquarian to the modern, mainly on travel.

There are a number of bedrooms at the club for out-of-town members. The dress code is formal at all times.

'''True north''' (also called '''geodetic north''') is the direction along [[Earth]]'s surface towards the geographic [[North Pole]].

[[geodesy|Geodetic]] north differs from ''magnetic'' north (the direction a [[points of the compass|compass points]] toward the [[Magnetic North Pole]]), and from [[grid north]] (the direction northwards along the grid lines of a [[map projection]]). Geodetic true north also differs very slightly from ''astronomical'' true north (typically by a few [[arcsecond]]s) because the local [[gravity]] may not point at the exact [[axis of rotation|rotational axis]] of Earth.

The direction of astronomical true north is marked in the skies by the north [[celestial pole]]. This is within about 1° of the position of [[Polaris]], so that [[pole star|the star]] would appear to [[star trail|trace]] a tiny circle in the sky each [[sidereal time|sidereal day]]. Due to the [[axial precession]] of Earth, true north rotates in an arc with respect to [[fixed stars|the stars]] that takes approximately 25,000 years to complete. Around 2100–02, Polaris will make its closest approach to the celestial north pole (extrapolated from recent Earth precession).&lt;ref&gt;Meeus (1997), p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McClure |first=Bruce |year=2013 |url=http://earthsky.org/brightest-stars/polaris-the-present-day-north-star |title=Polaris is the North Star |work=Astronomy Essentials |publisher=[[EarthSky]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Smiley |first1=C. H. |last2=Majid Khan |first2=A. |url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/1959JRASC..53..249S/0000251.000.html |title=Polaris and Precession |work=Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada |volume=53 |page=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; The visible star nearest the north celestial pole 5,000 years ago was [[Thuban]].&lt;ref&gt;Ridpath (2004), p. 5. "Around 4800 years ago Thuban ({{GreekFont|α}} Draconis) lay a mere 0°.1 from the pole. Deneb ({{GreekFont|α}} Cygni) will be the brightest star near the pole in about 8000 years' time, at a distance of 7°.5."&lt;/ref&gt;

On maps published by the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) and the [[United States Armed Forces]], true north is marked with a line terminating in a five-pointed star. The east and west edges of the USGS topographic quadrangle maps of the United States are [[meridian (geography)|meridian]]s of [[longitude]], thus indicating true north (so they are not exactly parallel). Maps issued by the [[United Kingdom]] [[Ordnance Survey]] contain a diagram showing the difference between true north, grid north, and magnetic north at a point on the sheet; the edges of the map are likely to follow grid directions rather than true, and the map will thus be truly rectangular/square.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5329">The '''two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method''' is a method for combining a number of related types of information into a single, immediately meaningful, index that allows comparisons to be made across different locations. Its importance lies in the improvement over considering the individual sources of information separately, where none on its own provides an adequate summary.

==Background==

The two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method is a special case of a [[gravity model]] of [[Spatial analysis#Spatial interaction|spatial interaction]] that was developed to measure spatial accessibility to [[primary care physician]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Luo and Wang 2003a&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LWb"&gt;Luo and Wang 2003b&lt;/ref&gt; 2SFCA can also be used to measure other accessibility such as accessibility to jobs, to [[cancer care]] facilities, etc. It was inspired by the spatial decomposition idea first proposed by Radke and Mu (2000).

The 2SFCA method not only has most of the advantages of a gravity model, but is also intuitive to interpret, as it uses essentially a special form of physician-to-population ratio. It is easy to implement in a [[Geographic information system|GIS]] environment.&lt;ref name="LWb" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wang and Luo, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wang, 2006: 80-95&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, the 2SFCA method measures spatial accessibility as a ratio of primary-care physicians to population, combining two steps:
#it first assesses “physician availability” at the physicians' (supply) locations as the ratio of physicians to their surrounding population (i.e., within a threshold travel time from the physicians)
#it sums up the ratios (i.e., physician availability derived in the first step) around (i.e., within the same threshold travel time from) each residential (demand) location.

It has been recently enhanced by considering [[distance decay]] within catchments&lt;ref&gt;Luo and Qi, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and called the enhanced two-step floating catchment area (E2SFCA) method.

Furthermore, the use of capping certain services according to nearby population size,can improve the accuracy when analyzing across areas of different environments&lt;ref&gt;McGrail and Humphreys, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; (i.e. rural and urban).

The method has been applied to other related public health issues, such as access to healthy food retailers&lt;ref&gt;Chen, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7345">'''Ubigeo''' is the coding system for geographical locations ([[Spanish language|Spanish:]] ''Código Ubicacíon Geográfica'') in [[Peru]] used by the National Statistics and Computing Institute ([[Spanish language|Spanish:]] ''Instituto Nacional de Estadística e Informática'' [[INEI]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inei.gob.pe/ {{es}} Official web site of the ''INEI'' institute]&lt;/ref&gt;) to code the first-level administrative subdivision: [[Administrative divisions of Peru|regions]] ([[Spanish language|Spanish:]] ''regiones'', singular: ''región''), the second-level administrative subdivision: [[Provinces of Peru|provinces]] ([[Spanish language|Spanish:]] ''provincias'', singular: ''provincia'') and the third-level administrative subdivision: [[Districts of Peru|districts]] ([[Spanish language|Spanish:]] ''distritos'', singular: ''distrito'').

==Syntax==
The coding system uses two-digit numbers for each level of subdivision. The first level starts numbering at &lt;code&gt;01&lt;/code&gt; for the [[Amazonas Region]] and continues in alphabetical order up to &lt;code&gt;25&lt;/code&gt; for the [[Ucayali Region]]. Additional regions will be added to the end of the list, starting with the first available number.

The second level starts with &lt;code&gt;0101&lt;/code&gt; for the first province in the Amazonas region: [[Chachapoyas Province]] and continues up to &lt;code&gt;2504&lt;/code&gt; for the last province [[Purús Province|Purús]] in the [[Ucayali Region]]. The provinces are numbered per region with the first province always being the one in which the regions capital is located. The remaining provinces are coded in alphabetical order. Additional provinces will be added per region to the end of the list, starting with the first available province number.

The third level; starts with &lt;code&gt;010101&lt;/code&gt; for the first district in the first province in the Amazonas region: [[Chachapoyas District]] and continues up to &lt;code&gt;250401&lt;/code&gt; for the last district in the last province of the Ucayali region: [[Purús District]]. The districts are numbered per province with the first district always being the one in which the province’ capital is located. The remaining districts are coded in alphabetical order. Additional districts will be added per province to the end of the list, starting with the first available district number.
