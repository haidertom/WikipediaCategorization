In the [[19th century]], the philosophies of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] began to have a dramatic effect, the landmark works of philosophers such as [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] influencing new generations of thinkers. In the late 18th century a movement known as [[Romanticism]] began; it validated strong emotion as an authentic not of aesthetic experience, placing new emphasis on such emotions as trepidation, horror and terror and awe. Key ideas that sparked changes in philosophy were the fast progress of science; [[evolution]], as postulated by [[Lucilio Vanini|Vanini]], [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]], [[James Burnett, Lord Monboddo|Lord Monboddo]], [[Erasmus Darwin]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck|Lamarck]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], and [[Charles Darwin]]; and what might now be called [[Emergence|emergent]] order, such as the [[free market]] of [[Adam Smith]] within nation states. Pressures for [[egalitarianism]], and more rapid change culminated in a period of revolution and turbulence that would see philosophy change as well.

== Brief historical outline ==
With the tumultuous years of 1789–1815, European culture was transformed by revolution, war and disruption. By ending many of the social and cultural props of the previous century, the stage was set for dramatic economic and political change. European philosophy reflected on, participated in, and drove, many of these changes.

=== Influences from the late Enlightenment ===
The last third of the 18th century produced a host of ideas and works which would both systematize previous philosophy, and present a deep challenge to the basis of how philosophy had been systematized. [[Immanuel Kant]] is a name that most would mention as being among the most important of influences, as is [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. While both of these philosophers were products of the 18th century and its assumptions, they pressed at the boundaries. In trying to explain the nature of the state and government, Rousseau would challenge the basis of government with his declaration that "Man is born free, but is everywhere in chains". Kant, while attempting to preserve axiomic skepticism, was forced to argue that we do not see true reality, nor do we speak of it. All we know of reality is appearances. Since all we can see of reality is appearances, which are subject to certain necessary and subjective forms of perceptions, Kant postulates the idea of an unknowable (while at the same time limiting our use of science and the principle of causality to the appearances). Hegel's distinction between the unknowable and the circumstantially unknown can be seen as the beginnings of Hegel's rational system of the universe.

Yet another philosopher of the late Enlightenment that was influential in the 19th century was [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] (1749–1827), whose formulation of [[nomological determinism]] is famous up to this day.

== Philosophical schools and tendencies ==
This is a partial list of schools of 19th-century philosophy (also known as [[late modern philosophy]]).

===German idealism===
{{main|German idealism}}
{{also|Post-Hegelianism|Neo-Kantianism}}
One of the first philosophers to attempt to grapple with Kant's philosophy was [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], whose development of Kantian metaphysics became a source of inspiration for the [[Romanticism|Romantics]]. In ''[[Wissenschaftslehre (Fichte)|Wissenschaftslehre]]'', Fichte argues that the self posits itself and is a self-producing and changing process.

[[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]], a student of Fichte, continued to develop many of the same ideas and was also assimilated by the Romantics as something of an official philosopher for their movement. But it was another of Fichte's students, and former roommate of Schelling, who would rise to become the most prominent of the post-Kantian idealists: [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]. His work revealed the increasing importance of historical thinking in German thought.

[[Arthur Schopenhauer]], rejecting Hegel and also materialism, called for a return to Kantian transcendentalism, at the same time adopting [[atheism]] and [[determinism]], amongst others. His secular thought became more popular in Europe in the second half of the 19th century, which coincided with the advents of [[Darwinism]], [[positivism]], [[Marxism]] and [[David Strauss|philological analysis of the Bible]]. 

In the second half of the 19th century, an even more orthodox return to Kantian thought was espoused by a number of [[Neo-Kantianism|Neo-Kantian]] philosophers based in two main locations: the Marburg School and the Baden School. This trend of thought survived into the beginning of the next century, influencing 20th century philosophical movements such as Neopositivism and Phenomenology.

One of the most famous opponents of idealism in the first half of the German 19th century was [[Ludwig Feuerbach]], who advocated [[materialism]] and [[atheism]].

===Utilitarianism===
{{main|Utilitarianism}}
In early 19th century [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[John Stuart Mill]] promoted the idea that actions are right as they maximize happiness, and happiness alone.

===Marxism===
{{main|Marxism}}
Developed by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] in the mid-to-late-19th Century, Marxism is a sociopolitical and economic view based on the philosophy of [[dialectical materialism]], which opposes [[idealism]] in favour of the [[materialism|materialist]] viewpoint. Marx analysed [[Marx's theory of history|history]] itself as the progression of [[dialectic]]s in the form of [[class struggle]]. From this it is argued that "the history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles." According to Marx, this began with the phase of [[primitive communism]] ([[hunter-gatherer]] society), after which the [[Neolithic Revolution]] gave way to [[slavery|slave societies]], progressing into the [[feudal society]], and then into his present era of the [[Industrial Revolution]], after which he held that the next step was for the [[proletariat]] to overthrow the owners of industry and establish a [[socialist]] society, which would further develop into a [[communist]] society, in which class distinctions, money, and the state would have withered from existence entirely.

Marxism had a profound influence on the history of the 20th Century.

===Existentialism===
{{main|Existentialism|Søren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche}}
[[Existentialism]] as a philosophical movement is properly a [[20th-century philosophy|20th-century]] movement, but its major antecedents, [[Søren Kierkegaard]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] wrote long before the rise of existentialism. In the 1840s, academic philosophy in Europe, following Hegel, was almost completely divorced from the concerns of individual human life, in favour of pursuing abstract metaphysical systems. Kierkegaard sought to reintroduce to philosophy, in the spirit of [[Socrates]]: subjectivity, commitment, faith, and passion, all of which are a part of the [[human condition]].

Like Kierkegaard, Nietzsche saw the moral values of 19th-century Europe disintegrating into [[nihilism]] (Kierkegaard called it the ''levelling'' process). Nietzsche attempted to undermine traditional moral values by exposing its foundations. To that end, he distinguished between [[master-slave morality|master and slave moralities]], and claimed that man must turn from the meekness and humility of Europe's slave-morality.

Both philosophers are precursors to existentialism, among other ideas, for their importance on the "great man" against the age. Kierkegaard wrote of 19th-century Europe, "Each age has its own characteristic depravity. Ours is perhaps not pleasure or indulgence or sensuality, but rather a dissolute pantheistic contempt for the individual man."

===Positivism===
{{main|Positivism}}
[[Auguste Comte]], the self-professed founder of modern [[sociology]], put forward the view that the rigorous ordering of confirmable observations alone ought to constitute the realm of human knowledge. He had hoped to order the sciences in increasing degrees of complexity from mathematics, astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology, and a new discipline called "sociology", which is the study of the "dynamics and statics of society".&lt;ref&gt;Comte, Auguste. ''Course on Positive Philosophy''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pragmatism===
{{main|Pragmatism}}
The [[American philosophy|American philosophers]] [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] and [[William James]] developed the pragmatist philosophy in the late 19th century.

===British idealism===
The twilight years of the 19th century in [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] saw the rise of [[British idealism]], a revival of interest in the works of Kant and Hegel.

===Transcendentalism===
{{main|Transcendentalism}}
Transcendentalism was rooted in [[Immanuel Kant]]'s [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]] and [[German idealism]], led by [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and [[Henry David Thoreau]]. The main belief was in an ideal spiritual state that 'transcends' the physical and empirical and is only realized through the individual's intuition, rather than through the doctrines of established religions.

===Social Darwinism===
{{main|Social Darwinism}}
"Social Darwinism" refers to theories that apply the [[evolutionary]] concept of [[natural selection]] to [[human society]].

'''Apophantic''' ({{lang-el|ἀποφαντικός}}, "declaratory", from ἀποφαίνειν ''apophainein'', "to show, to make known") is a term [[Aristotle]] coined to mean a specific type of declaratory statement that can determine the truth or falsity of a [[logical proposition]] or phenomenon. It was adopted by [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[Martin Heidegger]] as part of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].&lt;ref&gt;Roderick Munday, [http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/b_resources/b_and_t_glossary.html#a "Glossary of Terms in ''Being and Time''"], Retrieved 2012-05-27&lt;/ref&gt; Marcuse defines it as "the logic of judgment".&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Marcuse, [http://www.marcuse.org/herbert/pubs/64onedim/odm5.html "One Dimensional Man: Part II, Chapter 5"], Retrieved 2012-05-27&lt;/ref&gt;

In Aristotle's usage, the Greek term ἀποφαντικὸς λόγος (apophantic speech) describes a statement that, by examining a proposition in itself, can determine what is true about a statement by establishing whether or not the predicate of a sentence may logically be attributed to its [[Subject (grammar)|subject]]. For example, logical propositions may be divided into ones that are semantically determinate, as in the sentence "All [[penguins]] are [[birds]]," and those that are semantically indeterminate, as in the sentence "All [[bachelors]] are unhappy." In the first proposition, the subject is ''penguins'' and the predicate is ''birds'', and the set of all birds is a category into which the subject of penguins should [[Logical truth|necessarily]] be put. In the second proposition, the subject is ''bachelors'' and the predicate is ''unhappy''.  This is a subjective, [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] connection that does not necessarily follow. An apophantic conclusion would, by examining the two statements—and not any evidence supporting or denying them—make a judgment between them that identifies "All penguins are birds" as more truthful than "All bachelors are unhappy." One would reach this conclusion simply because of the propositions' nature, and not because any penguins or bachelors had been consulted.

In [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[Martin Heidegger]] argues that apophantic judgements are the most reliable means of obtaining truth, as they do not rely upon subjective comparisons.&lt;ref&gt;Roderick Munday, [http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/b_resources/b_and_t_glossary.html#a "Glossary of Terms in ''Being and Time''"], Retrieved 2012-05-27&lt;/ref&gt; Before Heidegger, however, his former teacher Husserl had already centralized the role of apophantic judgment in his phenomenological 'transcendental logic', during the course lectures on passive synthesis in the mid 1920s.

The concept appears in the Arabic Aristotelian tradition as ''jâzim'', or 'truth-apt'.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2009/entries/arabic-islamic-language/ "Arabic and Islamic Philosophy of Language and Logic"], Retrieved 2012-05-27&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Aristotelian Society for the Systematic Study of Philosophy''', more generally known as the '''Aristotelian Society''', was founded at a meeting on 19 April 1880, at 17 [[Bloomsbury Square]].&lt;ref&gt;Five individuals attended this meeting: [[Frederick Gard Fleay|Mr. F. G. Fleay]], [[Alfred Senier|Dr. Alfred Senier]] (1853-I918) (later Professor of Chemistry in the University of Galway), [[Herbert Burrows|Mr. Herbert Burrows]], [[Edward Clarkson|Mr. Edward Clarkson]], and [[Alfred Lowe|Mr. Alfred Lowe]] (Carr, 1928-1929, pp.360).&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Overview==
The Aristotelian Society resolved "to constitute a society of about twenty and to include ladies; the society to meet fortnightly, on Mondays at 8 o'clock, at the rooms of the Spelling Reform Association…"&lt;ref&gt;Carr (1928-1929), 360.&lt;/ref&gt; The rules of the society stipulated:

{{quote|The object of this Society shall be the systematic study of philosophy; 1st, as to its historical development; 2nd, as to its methods and problems.}}

According to [[H. Wildon Carr]], in choosing a name for the society, it was:

{{quote|essential to find a name which would definitely prescribe the speculative character of the study which was to be the Society's ideal, and it seemed that this could best be secured by adopting the name of a philosopher eminently representative. There is only one such name in the history of philosophy and so we became the Aristotelian Society, not for the special study of Aristotle, or of [[Aristotelianism]], but for the systematic study of Philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;Carr (1928-1929), 361.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The society's first president was [[Shadworth Hodgson|Mr. Shadworth H. Hodgson]]. He was president for fourteen years from 1880 until 1894, when he proposed [[Bernard Bosanquet (philosopher)|Dr. Bernard Bosanquet]] as his replacement.

Professor Alan Willard Brown [https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/15/obituaries/dr-alan-w-brown.html] noted in 1947 that '[The Society]'s members were not all men of established intellectual position. It welcomed young minds just out of university as well as older amateur philosophers with serious interests and purposes. But many distinguished men were faithful members, and not the least virtue of the society has remained, even to the present day, the opportunity it affords for different intellectual generations to meet in an atmosphere of reasoned and responsible discussion.'."&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1947), p.249.&lt;/ref&gt;

The society continues to meet fortnightly at the [[University of London]]'s [[Senate House (University of London)|Senate House]] to hear and discuss philosophical papers from all philosophical traditions. The current President (2016-2017) is [[Tim Crane]], a Professor of Philosophy at [[University of Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aristoteliansociety.org.uk/about/the-council "The Council"], Aristotelian Society.&lt;/ref&gt; Its other work includes giving grants to support the organisation of academic conferences in philosophy, and, with [[Oxford University Press]], the production of the 'Lines of Thought' series of philosophical monographs.

The society's annual conference, organised since 1918 in conjunction with the [[Mind Association]], (publishers of the philosophical journal ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]''), is known as the Joint Session of the Aristotelian Society and the Mind Association, and is hosted by different university departments in July each year.

==Publications==
The first edition of the society's proceedings, the '''''Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society for the Systematic Study of Philosophy''''', now the '''''Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society''''', was issued in 1888.

Papers from invited speakers at the Joint Session conference are published in June each year (i.e., before the joint conference) in '''''The Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, Supplementary Volume'''''.

The Proceedings and the Supplementary Volume are published by the society and distributed by [[Oxford University Press]]. The back run of both journals has been digitised by [[JSTOR]].

'''Associationism''' is the idea that mental processes operate by the [[Association (psychology)|association]] of one mental state with its successor states.

==History==

The idea is first recorded in [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], especially with regard to the succession of memories. Members of the principally British "''Associationist School''", including [[John Locke]], [[David Hume]], [[David Hartley (philosopher)|David Hartley]], [[Joseph Priestley]], [[James Mill]], [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Alexander Bain]], and [[Ivan Pavlov]], asserted that the principle applied to all or most mental processes.&lt;ref name="Boring"&gt;Boring, E. G. (1950) "A History of Experimental Psychology" New York, Appleton-Century-Crofts&lt;/ref&gt; Later members of the school developed very specific principles elaborating how associations worked and even a physiological mechanism bearing no resemblance to modern [[neurophysiology]].&lt;ref&gt;Pavlov, I.P. (1927, 1960) "Conditioned Reflexes" New York, Oxford (1927) Dover (1960)&lt;/ref&gt;  For a fuller explanation of the intellectual history of associationism and the "Associationist School", see ''[[Association of Ideas]]''.

Some of the ideas of the Associationist School anticipated the principles of [[Classical conditioning|conditioning]] and its use in [[behaviourism|behavioral psychology]].&lt;ref name="Boring"/&gt;

'''Axial Age''' (also '''Axis Age''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title =Introducing Philosophy of Religion | last =Meister | first = Chad | year= 2009 | publisher= Routledge | location = Abingdon | pages=10 | isbn=0-203-88002-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; from {{lang-de|Achsenzeit}}) is a term coined by [[Germany|German]] [[philosopher]] [[Karl Jaspers]] in the sense of a  "pivotal age" characterizing the period of [[ancient history]] from about the 8th to the 3rd century BCE.

Then, according to Jaspers' concept, new ways of thinking appeared in [[History of Iran|Persia]], [[History of India|India]], [[Zhou dynasty|China]] and the [[Classical antiquity|Greco-Roman world]] in [[religion]] and [[philosophy]], in a striking parallel development, without any obvious direct cultural contact between all of the participating [[Eurasia]]n cultures. Jaspers identified key thinkers from this age who had a profound influence on future philosophies and religions, and identified characteristics common to each area from which those thinkers emerged. 

Jaspers' approach to the culture of the middle of the [[first millennium BC]] has been adopted by other scholars and academics, and has become a point of discussion in the [[history of religion]].

==Definition==
Jaspers introduced the concept of an Axial Age in his book ''Vom Ursprung und Ziel der Geschichte'' (''The Origin and Goal of History''&lt;ref name="Jaspers"&gt;Karl Jaspers, '' Origin and Goal of History'', Routledge Revivals, 2011, {{ISBN|978-0415578806}}&lt;/ref&gt;), published in 1949. The simultaneous appearance of thinkers and philosophers in different areas of the world had been remarked by numerous authors since the 18th century, notably by the French Indologist [[Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron]].&lt;ref name="Metzler2009" /&gt; Jaspers explicitly cited some of these authors, including [[Victor von Strauß]] (1859) and [[Peter Ernst von Lasaulx ]](1870).&lt;ref name="Metzler2009"&gt;{{cite journal
|last1=Metzler|first1=Dieter
|title=Achsenzeit als Ereignis und Geschichte
|trans-title=Axial age as happening and history |language=German

Jasper's contribution was to claim that the Axial Age should be viewed as an objective empirical fact of history, independently of religious considerations.&lt;ref&gt;Jaspers K.,''The Origin and Goal of History'', p.1&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that during the Axial Age, "the spiritual foundations of humanity were laid simultaneously and independently in China, India, Persia, Judea, and Greece. And these are the foundations upon which humanity still subsists today".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jaspers | first = Karl | title = The Way to Wisdom : An Introduction to Philosophy | publisher = Yale University Press | year = 2003 | location = New Haven, CT |page=98 | isbn = 0-300-09735-2 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IfAgyKFpWaEC&amp;pg=PA98}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

He identified a number of key thinkers as having had a profound influence on future philosophies and religions, and identified characteristics common to each area from which those thinkers emerged. Jaspers held up this age as unique, and one to which the rest of the [[history of ideas|history of human thought]] might be compared.

==Characteristics==
Jaspers presented his first outline of the Axial age by a series of examples:

{{quote|[[Confucius]] and [[Lao-Tse]] were living in China, all the schools of Chinese philosophy came into being, including those of [[Mo Ti]], [[Zhuang Zhou|Chuang Tse]], [[Lieh Tzu]] and a host of others; India produced the [[Upanishads]] and [[Buddha]] and, like China, ran the whole gamut of philosophical possibilities down to [[materialism]], [[scepticism]] and [[nihilism]]; in Iran [[Zarathustra]] taught a challenging view of the world as a struggle between good and evil; in Palestine the prophets made their appearance from [[Elijah]] by way of [[Isaiah]] and [[Jeremiah]] to [[Deutero-Isaiah]]; Greece witnessed the appearance of [[Homer]], of the philosophers – [[Parmenides]], [[Heraclitus]] and [[Plato]], – of the tragedians, of [[Thucydides]] and [[Archimedes]]. Everything implied by these names developed during these few centuries almost simultaneously in China, India and the West.|Karl Jaspers, ''Origin and Goal of History'', p. 2}}
[[File:Karl Jaspers 1946.jpg|thumb|258x258px|Jaspers argued that the Axial Age gave birth to philosophy as a discipline]]
Jaspers described the Axial Age as "an interregnum between two ages of great [[empire]], a pause for [[liberty]], a deep breath bringing the most lucid consciousness".&lt;ref name="Jaspers51"&gt;{{Harvnb | Jaspers | 1953 | p = 51}} quoted in {{Harvnb | Armstrong | 2006 | p = 367}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that the Axial Age was a historically [[Liminality|liminal]] period, when old certainties had lost their validity and new ones were still not ready.&lt;ref name = "Thomassen"&gt;{{citation | last = Thomassen | first= Bjorn | authorlink= Bjorn Thomassen | journal = Anthropological Theory |volume = 10 | number = 4 | year=2010 | pages = 321–42 | title = Anthropology, multiple modernities and the axial age debate | url= http://ant.sagepub.com/content/10/4/321.full.pdf+html | doi= 10.1177/1463499610386659}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Jaspers had a particular interest in the similarities in circumstance and thought of its figures. Similarities included an engagement in the quest for human meaning&lt;ref name = "Neville"&gt;{{cite book | last = Neville | first = Robert Cummings | title=Religion in Late Modernity | url= https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN079145424X&amp;id=OWkrdZ2yh3EC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;vq=%22Axial+Age | year = 2002 | publisher = SUNY Press | isbn =0-7914-5424-X | page = 104}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the rise of a new [[elite]] class of religious leaders and thinkers in China, India and the Occident.&lt;ref name="Eisenstadt"&gt;{{cite book | last= Eisenstadt | first= SN | authorlink = Shmuel Eisenstadt | title = The Origins and Diversity of Axial Age Civilizations | year=1986 | publisher= SUNY Press | isbn = 0-88706-094-3 | pages=1–2 | chapter = Introduction | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0887060943&amp;id=OFGIYBK2hu8C&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

These spiritual foundations were laid by individual thinkers within a framework of a changing social environment. Jaspers argues that the characteristics appeared under similar political circumstances: China, India, the Middle East and the Occident each comprised multiple small states engaged in internal and external struggles.
The three regions all gave birth to, and then institutionalized, a tradition of travelling scholars, who roamed from city to city to exchange ideas. After the [[Spring and Autumn period]] and the [[Warring States period]], [[Taoism]] and [[Confucianism]] emerged in China. In other regions, the scholars were largely from extant religious traditions; in India, from [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Jainism]]; in Persia, from [[Zoroastrianism]]; in [[The Levant]], from [[Judaism]]; and in Greece, from [[Sophist|Sophism]] and other classical philosophies.

Many of the cultures of the axial age were considered second-generation societies because they were built on the societies that preceded them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Worlds Together Worlds Apart |last=Pollard |last2=Rosenberg |last3=Tignor |first= Elizabeth |first2=Clifford |first3=Robert|publisher = Norton|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-393-91847-2|location = NewYork|pages = 162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thinkers and movements==
[[Parshvanatha]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fisher | first = Mary Pat | title =Living Religions: An Encyclopedia of the World's Faiths | publisher = IB Tauris | year =1997 | location = London | isbn = 1-86064-148-2 | page = 115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia  | title =Parshvanatha  | encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica  | volume = Online  | year =2007  | url =http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9058576  | accessdate = 2007-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; (23rd Tirthankara in the 9th century BCE) and [[Mahavira]] (24th [[Tirthankara]] in the 6th century BCE), known as the [[fordmaker]]s of [[Jainism]] lived during this age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = Mahavira | title = Britannica Concise Encyclopedia | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica | year = 2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Answers | date = 28 Nov 2009 | url = http://www.answers.com/topic/mahavira | title = Mahavira}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They propagated the religion of [[sramana]]s (previous Tirthankaras) and influenced [[Indian philosophy]] by propounding the principles of [[Ahimsa in Jainism|ahimsa]] (non-violence), [[Karma in Jainism|karma]],  [[samsara]] and [[asceticism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Zydenbos | first = Robert J | authorlink = Robert J. Zydenbos | title = Jainism Today and Its Future | publisher = Manya Verlag | year =2006 | location = München | url =http://www.manyaverlag.de/jtaif.html | pages = 11, 56–57, 59}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Buddhism]], also of the sramana tradition of India, was another of the world's most influential philosophies, founded by [[Siddhartha Gautama]], or the Buddha, who lived during this period; its spread was aided by [[Ashoka]], who lived late in the period.

In China, the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] were in contention and [[Confucianism]] and [[Taoism]] arose during this era, and in this area it remains a profound influence on social and religious life.

[[Zoroastrianism]], another of Jaspers' examples, is one of the first monotheistic religions and some believe it greatly influenced modern Abrahamic religions with such conceptions as the devil and Heaven/Hell.&lt;ref name = "Boyce1979"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyce|first= Mary | authorlink = Mary Boyce | title = Zoroastrians: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices| publisher= Routledge| location= London| year= 1979 | isbn = 0-415-23903-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exact date of [[Zoroaster]]'s life is debated by scholars, with some, such as Mary Boyce, arguing that Zoroastrianism itself is significantly older.&lt;ref name= "Boyce1979" /&gt; Others, such as William W Malandra and RC Zaehner, suggest that he may indeed have been an early contemporary of Cyrus living around 600 BC.&lt;ref name = "Malandra1983"&gt;{{cite book|last=Malandra|first=William|authorlink=William W. Malandra|title=An Introduction to Ancient Iranian Religion|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location= Minneapolis|year=1983|isbn = 0-8166-1114-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Boyce and other leading scholars who once supported much earlier dates for Zarathustra/Zoroaster have recently changed their position on the time when he likely lived, so that there is an emerging consensus regarding him as a contemporary or near-contemporary of [[Cyrus the Great]].&lt;ref name = "B.A. Brown 2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Brian Arthur | authorlink = Brian Arthur Brown | title = Three Testaments: Torah, Gospel, and Quran | publisher= Rowman &amp; Littlefield | location= Lanham, MD | year= 2012 | pages = 23–24 | isbn = 978-1-4422-1492-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jaspers' axial shifts included the rise of [[Platonism]], which would later become a major influence on the Western world through both [[Christianity]] and secular thought throughout the [[Middle Ages]] and into the [[Renaissance]].

==Reception==
In addition to Jaspers, the philosopher [[Eric Voegelin]] referred to this age as ''The Great Leap of Being'', constituting a new spiritual awakening and a shift of perception from societal to individual values.&lt;ref name = "Voegelin1985"&gt;{{cite book| last= Voegelin|first= Eric|authorlink= Eric Voegelin| series= Collected Works | volume = 18 | title=Order and History (Volume V): In Search of Order|location=Columbia, [[Missouri|MO]] | publisher = The University of Missouri Press| year= 2000| origyear= 1985| isbn= 978-0-8262-1261-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thinkers and teachers like the Buddha, [[Pythagoras]], [[Heraclitus]], [[Parmenides]], and [[Anaxagoras]] contributed to such awakenings which Plato would later call ''[[anamnesis (philosophy)|anamnesis]]'', or a remembering of things forgotten.

[[David Christian (historian)|David Christian]] notes that the first "universal religions" appeared in the age of the first universal [[empire]]s and of the first all-encompassing [[trading network]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Christian | first1 = David | author-link1 = David Christian (historian) | title = Maps of Time: An Introduction to Big History | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VUqZl7RdNtwC | series = California World History Library | volume = 2 | publisher = University of California Press | publication-date = 2004 | page = 319 | isbn = 978-0-520-23500-7 | accessdate = 2013-12-29 | quote = Not until the first millennium BCE do the first universal religions appear. Though associated in practice with particular dynasties or empires, they proclaimed universal truths and worshiped all-powerful gods. It is no accident that universal religions appeared when both empires and exchange networks reached to the edge of the known universe. Nor is it an accident that one of the earliest religions of this type, Zoroastrianism, appeared in the largest empire of the mid-first millennium BCE, that of the Achaemenids, and at the hub of trade routes that were weaving Afro-Eurasia into a single world system. Indeed, most of the universal religions appeared in the hub region between Mesopotamia and northern India. They included Zoroastrianism and Manichaeism in Persia, Buddhism in India, Confucianism in China, and Judaism, Christianity and Islam in the Mediterranean world.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anthropology|Anthropologist]] [[David Graeber]] has pointed out that "the core period of Jasper's Axial age [...] corresponds almost exactly to the period in which coinage was invented.  What's more, the three parts of the world where coins were first invented were also the very parts of the world where those sages lived; in fact, they became the epicenters of Axial Age religious and philosophical creativity."&lt;ref name = "Graeber"&gt;{{Harvnb | Graeber | 2011 | p = 224}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on the work of classicist [[Richard Seaford]] and literary theorist [[Marc Shell]] on the relation between coinage and early Greek thought, Graeber argues that an understanding of the rise of markets is necessary to grasp the context in which the religious and philosophical insights of the Axial age arose.

The '''belief–desire–intention''' ('''BDI''') model of human practical reasoning was developed by [[Michael Bratman]] as a way of explaining future-directed intention.

BDI is fundamentally reliant on [[folk psychology]] (the 'theory theory'), which is the notion that our mental models of the world are theories. It was used as a basis for developing the [[belief–desire–intention software model]].

==Applications==

BDI was part of the inspiration behind the [[Belief–desire–intention software model|BDI software architecture]], which Bratman was also involved in developing. Here, the notion of intention was seen as a way of limiting time spent on deliberating about what to do, by eliminating choices inconsistent with current intentions.

BDI has also aroused some interest in psychology. BDI formed the basis for a computational model of childlike reasoning [https://web.archive.org/web/20070629002644/http://cognition.iig.uni-freiburg.de/csq/pdf-files/Wahl_Spada.pdf CRIBB]. It has been proposed that autistic children do not recognise other people as folk-psychological agents (i.e., agents with their own beliefs, etc.). BDI has been used to develop a [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/7906/21803/01011803.pdf rehabilitation strategy] to teach autistic children to reason about other people.

'''Byzantinism''', or '''Byzantism''', is the political system and culture of the [[Byzantine Empire]], and its spiritual successors, in particular, the Christian [[Balkan]] states ([[Greece]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Serbia]]) and Orthodox countries in Eastern Europe ([[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]] and most importantly, [[Russia]]).&lt;ref name=dim3&gt;Dimiter G.

This negative reputation stressed the confusing complexities of the Empire's [[Byzantine aristocracy and bureaucracy|ministries]] and the elaborateness of its court ceremonies. Likewise, the "Byzantine system" also suggests a penchant for intrigue, plots and assassinations and an overall unstable political state of affairs. The term has been criticized by modern scholars for being a [[generalization]] that is not very representative of the reality of the [[Byzantine aristocracy and bureaucracy]].&lt;ref name=dim6&gt;Angelov 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XucseZUlNxYC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;vq=byzantinism&amp;dq=byzantinism+Leontiev&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=pl&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 p.6]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dim1718&gt;Angelov 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XucseZUlNxYC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;vq=byzantinism&amp;dq=byzantinism+Leontiev&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=pl&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 pp.17–18]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aristocracy and bureaucracy==
{{Main|Byzantine bureaucracy}}

The [[Byzantine Empire]] is a modern term applied by Westerners to the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] (that survived a thousand years after the western one collapsed in 476) and thus had a complex system of [[aristocracy]] and [[bureaucracy]] which was derived from earlier [[Roman Empire|Roman]] systems. At the apex of the pyramid stood the [[Byzantine emperor|Emperor]], sole ruler and divinely ordained, and beneath him a multitude of officials and court functionaries operated the administrative machinery of the state. A key component of state power was the prestige of the Imperial institution and its long antiquity. Ceremony and the granting of both honorific titles and valuable offices was therefore extensive and elaborate.

Over the nearly fifteen hundred years of the empire's existence, different titles were adopted and discarded, and many lost or gained prestige. By the time of [[Heraclius]] in the 7th century many of the early Roman titles, grounded in the Latin language and the traditions of the old Roman republic had become obsolete in the now mostly Greek-speaking empire, although Latin survived longer in law and in the military. Heraclius formally changed the official language to Greek from Latin in 620. Titles inspired by their Greek tradition, often only rough approximation of Latin concepts, became common (i.e. "basileus" [βασιλεύς] instead of "caesar" or "augustus" for the title of the emperor himself). Other titles changed meaning (for example, "Patriarch") or were devalued with time (such as "consul").

Among important qualities of the Empire was also the [[caesaropapism]], the subjugation of church to the state.&lt;ref name=dim4-5&gt;Angelov 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XucseZUlNxYC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;vq=byzantinism&amp;dq=byzantinism+Leontiev&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=pl&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 pp.4–5]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The [[Byzantine Empire]] acquired a negative reputation in the [[Western world]] as early as the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name=dim6/&gt;&lt;ref name=dim7&gt;Angelov 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XucseZUlNxYC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;vq=byzantinism&amp;dq=byzantinism+Leontiev&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=pl&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 p.6]&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] by [[Charlemagne]] in the 9th century and the [[East–West Schism]] in the 11th century made the Empire an outcast to the Western European countries following the [[Catholic Church|Roman Church]], and the [[Siege of Constantinople (1204)|siege and sack of Constantinopole]] during the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204 only cemented those differences.&lt;ref name=dim7/&gt; Hence the European medieval stereotypes of the people of the Byzantine Empire portrayed them as perfidious, treacherous, servile, effeminate and unwarlike.&lt;ref name=dim7/&gt;

Medievalist [[Steven Runciman]] described the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Europe]]an view of the Byzantine Empire by saying:
{{quote|Ever since our rough crusading forefathers first saw [[Constantinople]] and met, to their contemptuous disgust, a society where everyone read and wrote, ate food with forks and preferred diplomacy to war, it has been fashionable to pass the Byzantines by with scorn and to use their name as synonymous with decadence.|[[Steven Runciman]], ''The Emperor Romanus Lecapenus and His Reign: A Study of Tenth-Century Byzantium'', 1988&lt;ref&gt;Steven Runciman, ''The Emperor Romanus Lecapenus and His Reign: A Study of Tenth-Century Byzantium'', Cambridge University Press, 1988, {{ISBN|0-521-35722-5}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XHVzWN6gqxQC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=%22Ever+since+our+rough+crusading+forefathers+first+saw%22&amp;ei=Xp8JSseLL4SSzQSa2LH4Cw Google Print, p.9]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Praise==
While the Byzantine Empire was commonly seen in a negative fashion, there were exceptions. Byzantium was rehabilitated in France during the [[Age of Absolutism]], from the 17th century to the [[French Revolution]], in the works of such individuals as the [[Jesuit]] [[Pierre Poussines]].&lt;ref name=dim8/&gt;

As the Enlightenment swept Western Europe, French traditions found refuge in the [[Russian Empire]]. The term Byzantinism was used in a positive context by 19th-century Russian scholar [[Konstantin Leontiev]] in ''Byzantism and Slavdom'' (1875) to describe the type of society which [[Russian Empire]] needs to counter the [[liberalism|degenerating influence]] of the [[Western world|West]].&lt;ref name=dim12/&gt;&lt;ref name=pipes&gt;Richard Pipes, ''Russian Conservatism and Its Critics: A Study in Political Culture'', Yale University Press, 2007, {{ISBN|0-300-12269-1}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=I1yCrMAfg_IC&amp;pg=PA148&amp;vq=byzantinism&amp;dq=byzantinism+Leontiev&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=pl&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 Google Print, pp.148–149]&lt;/ref&gt; Leontiev praised the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the [[tsarist autocracy]], and a society and political system that comprises authoritative power of the monarch, devout following of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], the maintenance of [[obshchina]] for peasants, and sharp class division; he also criticized [[universal education]] and [[democracy]].&lt;ref name=pipes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K.

{{quote|When we mentally picture Byzantinism we see before us as if... the austere, clear plan of a spacious and capacious structure. We know, for example, that in politics it means autocracy. In religion, it means Christianity with distinct features, which distinguish it from Western churches, from heresies and schisms. In the area of ethics we know that the Byzantine ideal does not have that elevated and in many instances highly exaggerated notion of terrestrial human individual introduced into history by German feudalism. We know the inclination of the Byzantine ethical ideal to be disappointed in all that is of this world, in happiness, in the constancy of our own purity, in our capacity here, below, to attain complete moral perfection. We know that Byzantinism (as Christianity in general) rejects all hope of the universal well-being of nations; it is the strongest antithesis of the idea of well-being of nations; it is the strongest antithesis of the idea of humanity in the sense of universal worldly equality, universal worldly freedom, universal worldly perfectibility, and universal contentment. |[[Konstantin Leontiev]], ''Byzantism and Slavdom'' (1875)}}

In Russian political discourse, Russia is sometimes affectionately called ''[[Third Rome]]'', the second Rome being the Eastern Roman Empire, which outlived its western counterpart at Rome itself, the first Rome, by a thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Raphael Johnson, ''The Third Rome: Holy Russia, Tsarism and Orthodoxy'', The Foundation for Economic Liberty, Inc, 2004, {{ISBN|0-9742303-0-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evgeny Pavlov, ''[http://www.eusanz.org/pdf/conf02/pavlov_eusanz_2002.pdf The new Third Rome?

In his article, "Was There Ever Byzantinism?" Alexander Mirkovic argued that many Western authors have created an imagined picture of Byzantium as a projection of their own anxieties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isidore-of-seville.com/goudenhoorn/82alexander.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180108000000/http://www.isidore-of-seville.com/goudenhoorn/82alexander.html |archivedate=2018-01-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cartesian anxiety''' refers to the notion that, since [[René Descartes]] posited his influential form of [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|body-mind dualism]], Western [[civilization]] has suffered from a longing for [[ontology|ontological]] certainty, or feeling that [[scientific method]]s, and especially the study of the world as a thing separate from ourselves, should be able to lead us to a firm and unchanging [[knowledge]] of ourselves and the world around us. The term is named after Descartes because of his well-known emphasis on "mind" as different from "body", "[[self]]" as different from "[[Other (philosophy)|other]]". 

[[Richard J. Bernstein]] coined the term in his 1983 book ''Beyond Objectivism and Relativism: Science, Hermeneutics, and Praxis''.

'''Chronocentrism''' is the assumption that certain time periods (typically the [[present]]) are better, more important, or a more significant frame of reference than other time periods, either past or future.

==History==
Chronocentrism (from the Greek ''[[wikt:chrono-|chrono-]]'' meaning "time") was coined by sociologist Jib Fowles in an article in the journal ''Futures'' in February, 1974. Fowles described chronocentrism as "the belief that one's own times are paramount, that other periods pale in comparison".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fowles |first1=Jib |title=On Chronocentrism |work=Futures |volume=6 |number=1 |doi=10.1016/0016-3287(74)90008-1 |date=February 1974 |page=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, it has been defined as "the egotism that one's own generation is poised on the very cusp of history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Standage |first=Tom |authorlink=Tom Standage |title=[[The Victorian Internet|The Victorian Internet: The Remarkable Story of the Telegraph and the Nineteenth Century's On-line Pioneers]] |year=2007 |publisher=Walker &amp; Company |isbn=0-8027-1604-0 |pages=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term had been used earlier in a study about attitudes to ageing in the workplace. Chronocentricity: "...only seeing the value of one's own age cohort...described the tendency for younger managers to hold negative perceptions of the abilities or other work-related competencies of older employees."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lyon |first1=Phil |last2=Pollard |first2=D|title=Perceptions of the older employee: is anything really changing?|journal=Personnel Review|volume=26 |number=4 |doi=10.1108/00483489710172051|date=1 January 1997 |page=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of discrimination is a form of [[ageism]].

==Ethnocentrism==

Chronocentrism as [[ethnocentrism]] is the perceiving and judging of a culture's historical values in terms of the standards of one's own time period.

==Antichronocentrism==

The [[Long Now Foundation]] is an organization that encourages the use of 5-digit years, e.g. "02016" instead of "2016," to help emphasize how early the present time is in their vision of the timeline of humanity.  The use of two-digit years before [[Y2K]] was an example of chronocentrism (in the early years of computing, the years 2000 and 1899 were believed to be too far in the future or the past, and thus of less importance than being able to save two digits in computerizing and typing out years).

==In science==
The "Copernican time principle" is a temporal analog of the [[Copernican principle]] for space, which states that no spatial location is any more or less special of a frame of reference than any other spatial location (i.e., that our physical universe has no center). Some authors have extended this to also include that no point in time is any more or less special than any other point in time (e.g., in outdated [[steady-state theories]]), though this cannot be universally applied (e.g., the [[Big-Bang singularity]] is a special point in time that can be logically used as a frame of reference to date later events.)

A '''co-premise''' is a [[premise]] in [[reasoning]] and [[informal logic]] which is not the main supporting reason for a [[main contention|contention]] or a [[Lemma (logic)|lemma]], but is logically necessary to ensure the [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of an [[argument]]. One premise by itself, or a group of co-premises can form a reason. 

== Logical structure ==

Every significant term or phrase appearing in a premise of a [[simple argument]], should also appear in the contention/conclusion or in a co-premise. But this by itself does not guarantee a valid argument, see the [[fallacy of the undistributed middle]] for an example of this.

Sometimes a co-premise will not be explicitly stated. This type of argument is known as an 'enthymematic' argument, and the co-premise may be referred to as a 'hidden' or an 'unstated' co-premise and will often be subject to an [[inference objection]]. In this [[argument map]] of a simple argument the two reasons for the main contention are co-premises and not separate reasons for believing the contention to be true. They are both necessary to ensure that the argument as a whole retains logical validity.
[[Image:What the Bible says.jpg|left]]
{{-}}
In this example, "What the Bible says is true" is a hidden co-premise.

The '''commentary of a philosophical text''' is the analysis of a philosophical text that is undertaken from different angles and points of view, and that enables the study of its nature and characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Frank. (1998). From Metaphysics to Ethics: A Defense of Conceptual Analysis. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Commentary has been a very important and useful tool. A large portion of the philosophical schools was originated through the analysis that different commentarists carried out of renowned philosophical texts. In [[ancient Greek]] and [[ancient Rome|Rome]], renowned [[schools of thought]] were started by commenting on texts from [[Plato]] and [[Aristoteles]]. A significant portion of [[Thomas Aquinas]] philosophical ideas were the result of commentaries to some of Aristoteles ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Margolis, E. &amp; Laurence, S. (2006). "Concepts". The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;

The commentary of philosophical text tracks its roots to the importance and relevance that philosophy assigns to the analysis of the language and the interpretation of texts.

'''Critical practice''' is the methodology used by a [[critic]] or observer to understand and evaluate a [[Field of study|field of knowledge]].  While sometimes the fields of knowledge studied are academic, non-academic fields such as merchandising, law enforcement and medical clinical practice have been extensively studied. Critical practice is grounded in the concepts of [[critical theory]]. Consultants employing critical practice skills aim to help people improve outcomes. Analysis is applied to groups working in a particular area of expertise and with identifiable practice skills, and usually to a defined range of problems and situations. Thus, practice tends to be based on a restricted view of people and their problems with a limited range of values applied in that practice.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} 

Critical practice aims to develop the ability and skill to see beyond the usual concerns of any given profession, into its unintended side effects, causes and consequences, and to do so from a critical and evaluative perspective.

Thus, for example, the profession of [[social work]] might be practiced critically through practitioners being conscious that their role may be seen, and could operate, as an agent of [[social control]], rather than just one of promoting some degree of liberation or of empowerment. In such a case the practitioner would be both the observer and the observed.

'''''D'Alembert’s Dream''''' ( or '''The Dream of D'Alembert''', {{lang-fr|'''Le Rêve de d'Alembert'''}}) is an ensemble of three philosophical dialogues authored by [[Denis Diderot]] in 1769, which first appeared in Grimm's ''Correspondance Littéraire'' in 1782, but was not published in its own right until 1830:

* Conversation between d’Alembert and Diderot
* D’Alembert’s Dream
* Continuation of the Conversation between d’Alembert and Diderot

In this work, Diderot is at the zenith of his development of [[materialism|materialist]] theories. It is here that he introduces his theory on life and nature, indicating that matter is not fixed but that, on the contrary, subject to [[evolution]]. Each species in existence transforms itself and gives birth to a new species.

He would later create a special version for his patroness, [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]] of Russia, replacing the certain character names.

'''Defensivism''' is a philosophical standpoint related in spirit to the [[Non-aggression principle]]. It is also a midway point between other combat-based philosophies, that of [[Just War]] and [[Pacifism]]. 

The standpoint of Defensivism is that only Defensive actions are moral. You may move to someone's aid as long as they are in immediate danger, or protect yourself from immediate harm. 

To a country, it holds that a military force may never leave its home country's own borders except to move to the aid of someone else (and in such a situation, that they may only protect sites from harm that they are specifically invited to, with no aggressive action taken whatsoever). 

Any form of preemptive strike, any type of capture, revenge, or any situation where one would fire the first actual shot or throw the first actual blow is against the Defensivist standpoint. Also, any form of combative action must cease the moment the opposition stops fighting, withdraws, gives up, or ceases aggressive action. 

Generally, Defensivism only allows the taking of life when the life that would be taken is actively threatening another life.

{{italic title}}
'''''Derech HaShem''''' (The "Way of God") is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] text written in the 1730s by Rabbi [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]].  It systematizes the basic principles of [[Judaism|Jewish]] belief regarding the [[existence of God]], God's purpose in [[Creation myth|creation]], and the [[logical consequence]] of other concepts in Judaism. The reader is led from thought to idea, from idea to a logical whole of the structure of Jewish belief. 

Presented from a [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] perspective, yet presupposing no prior knowledge and without the use of Kabbalistic terminology, this work provides a foundation for understanding the [[worldview]] and ideas found in the ''[[Zohar]]'', the writings of Rabbi [[Isaac Luria]] the ''Ari'zal'' and other Kabbalistic works.  

The book is organized into four main sections: the general basis of all existence, God's Divine Providence, [[prophecy]], and religious observance.

'''Dysteleology''' is the [[philosophy|philosophical]] view that [[existence]] has no ''[[telos (philosophy)|telos]]'' - no [[Four causes|final cause]] from purposeful [[design]]. [[Ernst Haeckel]] (1834-1919) invented and popularized the word "dysteleology"&lt;ref&gt;

Dysteleology is an aggressive, yet optimistic, form of science-oriented [[atheism]]{{cn|date=October 2018}} originally perhaps{{or|date=October 2018}} associated with Haeckel and his followers, but now perhaps more associated{{by whom?|date=October 2018}} with the type of atheism of [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]], or [[Christopher Hitchens]]. Transcending traditional philosophical and religious perspectives, such as [[German idealism]] (including the philosophies of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]]) and contemporary [[New Age]] thinking, [[Modernism|modern]] [[philosophical naturalism]] sees existence as having no inherent goal.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

'''Ecotechnics''' is defined as the '[[techne]]' of bodies. Ecotechnics thinks of the body as a technology which makes possible the inclusion of a whole new range of bodies. This gives people more agency and [[biopower]] over their own use of their bodies. This makes it usable for [[queer theory]] and [[disability studies]]. The term is then also central in Sullivan's and Murray's collection of essays ''Queering the Technologisation of Bodies''. It is built on [[Bernard Stiegler]]'s work that sees the body and technology as a double process: the technology and the body are informed by each other. [[Derrida]] who extends on both Jean-Luc Nancy and Stiegler's ideas argues that the 'proper body' implicates interconnections of technical additions. Ecotechnics goes against the [[essentialist]] and binary notion of the body as a technological object which positions it within [[post-structuralism]]. The body can only be understood within its environment and this environment is a technical one.

In the [[philosophy of mind]], '''emergent''' (or '''emergentist''') '''materialism''' is a theory which asserts that the [[mind]] is an irreducible existent in some sense, albeit not in the sense of being an [[ontology|ontological]] simple, and that the study of [[mental event|mental phenomena]] is independent of other sciences.

The view can be divided into emergence which denies [[mental causation]] and emergence which allows for causal effect.  A version of the latter type has been advocated by [[John R. Searle]], called [[biological naturalism]].  
  
The other main group of materialist views in the philosophy of mind can be labeled non-emergent (or non-emergentist) materialism, and includes [[Type physicalism|identity theory (reductive materialism)]], philosophical [[behaviorism]], [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]], and [[eliminative materialism|eliminativism (eliminative materialism)]].

'''Exceptionalism''' is the perception or belief that a species, country, society, institution, movement, individual, or time period is "[[wiktionary:exceptional|exceptional]]" (''i.e.'', unusual or extraordinary). The term carries the implication that the referent is superior in some way, whether specified or not. Although the idea appears to have developed with respect to an era, today the term is particularly applied in national or regional contexts. Other uses include medical and genetic exceptionalism. 

==History==
The German romantic philosopher-historians, especially [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] (1744–1803) and [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] (1762–1814), dwelt on the theme of uniqueness in the late 18th century. They de-emphasized the political state and instead emphasized the uniqueness of the ''Volk'', comprising the whole people, their languages and traditions.  Each nation, considered as a cultural entity with its own distinctive history, possessed a "national spirit", or "soul of the people" (in German: ''Volksgeist'').  This idea had a strong influence in the growth of nationalism in 19th-century European lands—especially in ones ruled by [[élite]]s from somewhere else.&lt;ref&gt;Royal J. Schmidt, "Cultural Nationalism in Herder", ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', Vol. 17, No. 3 (June 1956), pp. 407–17 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2707552 in JSTOR]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Claims of exceptionality have been made for many countries, including the [[United States]], Australia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.humanrights.gov.au/news/speeches/international-human-rights-australian-exceptionalism|title=Speeches|website=www.humanrights.gov.au|accessdate=1 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; France, Germany, Greece,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mod-langs.ox.ac.uk/files/exceptionalism/article2.html|title=Questioning Greek Exceptionalism|first=wehnerj|last=(jwehner@wehnerweb.com)|website=www.mod-langs.ox.ac.uk|accessdate=1 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; India, Pakistan, [[Imperial Japan]], Iran, Israel, North Korea, South Africa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/opinionista/2013-10-24-south-africa-is-in-africa/#.WMCbezuGPIU|title=South Africa IS in 'Africa' - Daily Maverick|first=Simamkele|last=Dlakavu|publisher=|accessdate=1 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://journalismiziko.dut.ac.za/feature-review/south-africas-worrying-exceptionalism/ | title=South Africa's Worrying Exceptionalism | publisher=[[Durban University of Technology]] | work=Iziko Live | date=October 29, 2013 | accessdate=September 2, 2018 | author=Raymond Padya, Journalism Editor}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spain, Britain, the USSR, the European Union, and Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://nolte.rewi.hu-berlin.de/doc/pub/European_Exceptionalism.pdf | title=European exceptionalism? | author=[[Georg Nolte]] and Helmut Philipp Aust | journal=Global Constitutionalism | year=2013 | volume=2 | issue=3 | pages=407 – 436 | doi=10.1017/S2045381713000038| hdl=10419/66220 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=du même auteur |url=http://www.cairn.info/resume.php?ID_ARTICLE=EUFOR_359_0083 |title=Becoming Exceptional?

Chase-Dunn, Thomas D. Hall, and E. Susan Manning, "Rise and Fall: East-West Synchronicity and Indic Exceptionalism Reexamined", ''Social Science History'', Volume 24, Number 4, Winter 2000, pp. 727–54 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/social_science_history/v024/24.4chase-dunn.html in Project Muse]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism == 

Belief in exceptionalism can represent erroneous thought analogous to [[historicism]] in that it overemphasizes peculiarities in an analysis and ignores or downplays meaningful comparisons {{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}. A group may assert ''exceptionalism'' in order to exaggerate the appearance of difference, to invoke a wider latitude of action, and to avoid recognition of similarities that would reduce perceived justifications {{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}. This can be an example of [[special pleading]], a form of spurious argumentation that ignores relevant bases for meaningful comparisons {{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}.

== Separateness ==
[[J. Bradford DeLong]] has used the term "exceptionalism" to describe the economic growth of post-[[World War II]] [[Western Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=DeLong|first1=J. Bradford|authorlink1=J. Bradford DeLong|title=Post-WWII Western European Exceptionalism: The Economic Dimension|url=http://econ161.berkeley.edu/Econ_Articles/ucla/ucla_marshall2.html|publisher=[[University of California]]|accessdate=14 November 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120728125244/http://econ161.berkeley.edu/Econ_Articles/ucla/ucla_marshall2.html|archivedate=28 July 2012|location=Berkeley|date=September 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exceptionalism can represent an error analogous to [[historicism]] in assuming that only peculiarities are relevant to analysis, while overlooking meaningful comparisons. "[W]hat is seemingly exceptional in one country may be found in other countries."{{attribution needed|date=April 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japanesestudies.org.uk/discussionpapers/Matsuda.html |title=ejcjs - Exceptionalism in Political Science: Japanese Politics, US Politics, and Supposed International Norms |publisher=Japanesestudies.org.uk |date= 2003-08-13|accessdate=2015-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ideologically-driven debates, a group may assert ''exceptionalism'', with or without the term, in order to exaggerate the appearance of difference, perhaps to create an atmosphere permissive of a wider latitude of action, and to avoid recognition of similarities that would reduce perceived justifications. If unwarranted, this represents an example of [[special pleading]], a form of spurious argumentation that ignores relevant bases for meaningful comparison.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

The term "exceptionalism" can imply criticism of a tendency to remain separate from others. For example, the reluctance of the [[United States]] government to join various [[international treaties]] is sometimes called "exceptionalist".&lt;ref name="foreignaffairs.org"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Park |first=Jeanne |url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2000-11-01/new-sovereigntists-american-exceptionalism-and-its-false-prophets |title=The New Sovereigntists: American Exceptionalism and Its False Prophets |journal=Foreign Affairs |issue=November/December 2000 |date= November 2000|accessdate=2015-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical exceptionalism==
Use of the term "[[HIV exceptionalism]]" implies that AIDS is a contagious disease that is or should be treated differently from other contagions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hanssens |first=Catherine ([[Lambda Legal]]) |url=http://www.thebody.com/hanssens/exceptionalism.html |title=Inventing "AIDS Exceptionalism" |publisher=[[TheBody.com]]|date=Winter 1997/1998 |accessdate=2015-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; or entails benefits not available to those suffering from other diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Sheryl Gay Stolberg|title=New Challenge to Idea That 'AIDS Is Special'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/12/us/new-challenge-to-idea-that-aids-is-special.html?pagewanted=all|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=14 November 2015|location=[[New York City]]|date=12 November 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[United States Congress]]|title=Congressional Record, V. 152, Pt. 16, September 29 2006|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iwW_dE91hF4C&amp;pg=PA539-IA69|date=25 October 2010|publisher=[[United States Government Publishing Office]]|location=|isbn=978-0-16-086781-1|page=539}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Genetic exceptionalism]] is a policy program that [[medicalizes]] genetic information.  Like the exceptionalism surrounding HIV testing, genetic exceptionalism is based on the belief that the average person needs a licensed health professional for guidance and support through the discovery of information with health implications, even if this information is common knowledge, such as that the person has red hair, which is associated with a higher risk of sunburns and skin cancer.  In countries with strong genetic exceptionalism laws, permission from a physician is necessary to obtain information about one's genes.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==Biography==

===Early life===
Born on 15 December 1923, at [[Crowthorne]] in [[Berkshire]], Dyson is the son of the English composer [[George Dyson (composer)|George Dyson]], who was later knighted. His mother had a law degree, and after Dyson was born she worked as a social worker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildriverreview.com/quarkpark_dyson.php |title=The Scientist as Rebel |access-date=5 December 2017}} Wild River Review Interview by Joy E. Stocke&lt;/ref&gt; Although not known to be related to the early 20th-century astronomer [[Frank Watson Dyson]], as a small boy Dyson was aware of him and has credited the popularity of an astronomer sharing his surname with helping to spark his own interest in science.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman Dyson. From Eros to Gaia 1992 p.vii&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of five he calculated the number of atoms in the sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |medium=Video |title=Greatest Mysteries of the Cold War: America's Interplanetary Spaceship (Project Orion) |publisher=BBC Four}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, he showed an interest in large numbers and in the solar system, and was strongly influenced by the book ''[[Men of Mathematics]]'' by [[Eric Temple Bell]].&lt;ref name=wired20140331 /&gt; Politically, Dyson says he was "brought up as a socialist".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Ghodsee | first = Kristen | year = 2015 | title = The Left Side of History: World War II and the Unfulfilled Promise of Communism in Eastern Europe | location = Durham, NC | publisher = Duke University Press | page = 5 | isbn = 978-0-822-35823-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1936 to 1941, Dyson was a Scholar at [[Winchester College]], where his father was Director of Music. At age 17 he studied mathematics with [[G.H. Hardy]] at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] (where he won a scholarship at age 15) and at age 19 was assigned to war work in the [[Operations research#Second World War|Operational Research Section]] (ORS) of the Royal Air Force's [[RAF Bomber Command|Bomber Command]],&lt;ref name=MIT&gt;{{cite web|last=Dyson|first=Freeman|title=A Failure of Intelligence|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/article/406789/a-failure-of-intelligence/|website=MIT Technology Review Magazine|publisher=MIT Technology Review|access-date=20 October 2013|date=1 November 2006|quote=Prominent physicist Freeman Dyson recalls the time he spent developing analytical methods to help the British Royal Air Force bomb German targets during World War II.}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he developed analytical methods to help the Royal Air Force bomb German targets during the [[World War II|Second World War]].&lt;ref name=MIT /&gt; After the war, Dyson was readmitted to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]],&lt;ref&gt;''Fractals in Physics: Essays in Honour of Benoit B. Mandelbrot : Proceedings of the International Conference Honouring Benoit B. Mandelbrot on His 65th Birthday, Vence, France, 1–4 October 1989'', p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; where he obtained a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] degree in mathematics.&lt;ref name=IAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Freeman Dyson|url=http://www.sns.ias.edu/dyson/|website=Institute for Advanced Study, School of Natural Sciences|publisher=Princeton University|access-date=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1946 to 1949, he was a [[Fellow]] of his college, occupying rooms just below those of the philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], who resigned his professorship in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Dyson, F. (10 Nov 2011) [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2012/nov/08/what-can-you-really-know/?pagination=false "What Can You Really Know"], [[New York Review of Books]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, Dyson published two papers in [[number theory]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Approximation to Algebraic Numbers by Rationals," Acta Mathematica (Uppsala), 89, 1947, pp. 225–240.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
"On Simultaneous Diophantine Approximations," Proceedings of the London
Mathematical Society, Series 2, 49, 1947, pp. 409–420.&lt;/ref&gt; Friends and colleagues describe him as shy and self-effacing, with a contrarian streak that his friends find refreshing but his intellectual opponents find exasperating. "I have the sense that when consensus is forming like ice hardening on a lake, Dyson will do his best to chip at the ice", [[Steven Weinberg]] said of him. His friend, the neurologist and author [[Oliver Sacks]], said: "A favourite word of Freeman's about doing science and being creative is the word 'subversive'. He feels it's rather important not only to be not orthodox, but to be subversive, and he's done that all his life."&lt;ref name="civil"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Dawidoff |first=Nicholas |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/29/magazine/29Dyson-t.html?_r=1&amp;ref=magazine |title=The Civil Heretic |work=The New York Times Magazine |date=25 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{clarify|reason=How does the following pertain to character?|date=November 2013}}

===Career in the United States===
On [[G. I. Taylor]]'s advise and recommendation, Dyson moved to the United States in 1947 as a Commonwealth Fellow to earn a physics doctorate with [[Hans Bethe]] at [[Cornell University]] (1947–48).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |subject= Freeman Dyson |interviewer=Finn Aaserud |title=Freeman Dyson |url=https://www.aip.org/history-programs/niels-bohr-library/oral-histories/4585 |publisher=American Institute of Physics |location=Princeton, New Jersey |date=17 December 1986 |work=Oral History Interviews }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = QED and the Men Who Made It|last = Schweber|first = Silvan S.|publisher = Princeton University Press|year = 1994|isbn = |location = Princeton, NJ|pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=61n5dE7FJQgC&amp;pg=492 392ff]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a week, however, he had made the acquaintance of [[Richard Feynman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlaPLvETBug|title = Freeman Dyson: A 'Rebel' Without a Ph.D|last = |first = |date = 11 June 2015|language = |at = Event at 1:17 |publisher = Quanta Magazine|access-date = 20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The budding English physicist recognized the brilliance of the flamboyant American, and attached himself as quickly as possible. He then moved to the Institute for Advanced Study (1948–49), before returning to England (1949–51), where he was a research fellow at the [[University of Birmingham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Freeman Dyson |url=http://www.aip.org/history/acap/biographies/bio.jsp?dysonf |publisher=The American Institute of Physics |access-date=23 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017131442/http://www.aip.org/history/acap/biographies/bio.jsp?dysonf |archivedate=17 October 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dyson never got his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] degree.

In 1949, Dyson demonstrated the equivalence of two then-current formulations of [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED): [[Richard Feynman]]'s diagrams and the operator method developed by [[Julian Schwinger]] and [[Shin'ichirō Tomonaga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=F. J. Dyson|title= The radiation theories of Tomonaga, Schwinger, and Feynman|journal=Phys. Rev.|volume=75|pages=486–502|year=1949|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.75.486|issue=3|bibcode = 1949PhRv...75..486D }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first person after their creator to appreciate the power of [[Feynman diagram]]s, and his paper written in 1948 and published in 1949 was the first to make use of them. He said in that paper that Feynman diagrams were not just a computational tool, but a physical theory, and developed rules for the diagrams that completely solved the [[renormalization]] problem. Dyson's paper and also his lectures presented Feynman's theories of QED in a form that other physicists could understand, facilitating the physics community's acceptance of Feynman's work. [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], in particular, was persuaded by Dyson that Feynman's new theory was as valid as Schwinger's and Tomonaga's. Oppenheimer rewarded Dyson with a lifetime appointment at the Institute for Advanced Study, "for proving me wrong", in Oppenheimer's words.&lt;ref name="Dyson, F.J. 1979"/&gt;

Also in 1949, in related work, Dyson invented the [[Dyson series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=F. J. Dyson|title= The S matrix in quantum electrodynamics|journal=[[Phys. Rev.]]|volume=75|pages=1736–1755|year=1949|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.75.1736|issue=11|bibcode = 1949PhRv...75.1736D }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was this paper that inspired [[John Clive Ward|John Ward]] to derive his celebrated [[Ward–Takahashi identity#The Ward identity|Ward identity]].&lt;ref name="qeid-jw-1950"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=J. C. Ward|journal=Phys. Rev.|volume=78|page=182|year=1950|bibcode = 1950PhRv...78..182W |doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.78.182|title=An Identity in Quantum Electrodynamics|issue=2 }}. [Note: this Ward letter opens with "It has been recently proven by Dyson&amp;nbsp;..."]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, Dyson joined the faculty at Cornell as a physics professor, although still lacking a doctorate, and in 1953, he received a permanent post at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], where he has now lived for more than sixty years.&lt;ref name="civil" /&gt; In 1957, he became a [[Naturalization|naturalized citizen]] of the United States and renounced his [[British nationality law|British nationality]]. One reason he gave decades later is that his children born in the United States had not been recognized as British subjects.&lt;ref name="brit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="abjure" /&gt;

From 1957 to 1961, he worked on [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Project Orion]], which proposed the possibility of space-flight using [[nuclear pulse propulsion]]. A prototype was demonstrated using [[Explosive material|conventional explosives]], but the 1963 [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty|Partial Test Ban Treaty]], in which Dyson was involved and supported, permitted only [[underground nuclear weapons testing]], so the project was abandoned.

In 1958, he led the design team for the [[TRIGA]], a small, inherently safe [[nuclear reactor]] used throughout the world in hospitals and universities for the production of [[Isotopes in medicine|medical isotopes]].

A seminal paper by Dyson came in 1966, when, together with Andrew Lenard and independently of [[Elliott H. Lieb]] and [[Walter Thirring]], he proved rigorously that the [[Pauli exclusion principle|exclusion principle]] plays the main role in the stability of bulk matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=F. J. Dyson, A. Lenard|journal=[[J. Math. Phys.]]|volume=8|issue=3|pages=423–434|year=1967|doi=10.1063/1.1705209|title=Stability of Matter. I|bibcode = 1967JMP.....8..423D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= F. J. Dyson, A. Lenard|journal=J. Math. Phys.|volume=9|issue= 5|pages= 698–711 |year=1968|doi= 10.1063/1.1664631|title= Stability of Matter. II|bibcode = 1968JMP.....9..698L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= E. H. Lieb, W. Thirring|journal=[[Phys. Rev. Lett.]]|volume=35|pages=687–689 |year=1975|doi= 10.1103/PhysRevLett.35.687|title= Bound for the Kinetic Energy of Fermions Which Proves the Stability of Matter|issue= 11|bibcode = 1975PhRvL..35..687L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, it is not the electromagnetic repulsion between outer-shell orbital electrons which prevents two wood blocks that are left on top of each other from coalescing into a single piece, but rather it is the exclusion principle applied to electrons and protons that generates the classical macroscopic [[normal force]]. In [[condensed matter physics]], Dyson also analysed the phase transition of the [[Ising model]] in 1 dimension and [[spin wave]]s.&lt;ref name=SelectedPapers&gt;F. J. Dyson, E. H. Lieb, ''Selected papers by Freeman Dyson'', AMS (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

Dyson also did work in a variety of topics in mathematics, such as topology, analysis, number theory and [[Random matrix|random matrices]].&lt;ref name="SelectedPapers" /&gt; There is an interesting story involving random matrices. In 1973, the number theorist [[Hugh Montgomery (mathematician)|Hugh Montgomery]] was visiting the Institute for Advanced Study and had just made his [[Montgomery's pair correlation conjecture|pair correlation conjecture]] concerning the distribution of the zeros of the [[Riemann zeta function]]. He showed his formula to the mathematician [[Atle Selberg]] who said it looked like something in [[mathematical physics]] and he should show it to Dyson, which he did. Dyson recognized the formula as the [[pair correlation function]] of the [[Gaussian unitary ensemble]], which has been extensively studied by physicists. This suggested that there might be an unexpected connection between the [[distribution of primes]] 2,3,5,7,11,&amp;nbsp; ... and the energy levels in the [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]] of [[heavy elements]] such as [[uranium]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Derbyshire]], ''[[Prime Obsession]]'', 2004, {{ISBN|0309085497}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1979, Dyson worked with the [[Oak Ridge Associated Universities|Institute for Energy Analysis]] on [[Climatology|climate studies]]. This group, under the direction of [[Alvin Weinberg]], pioneered multidisciplinary climate studies, including a strong biology group. Also during the 1970s, he worked on climate studies conducted by the [[JASON (advisory group)|JASON]] defense advisory group.&lt;ref name="civil" /&gt;

Dyson retired from the Institute for Advanced Study in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasonline.org/news-and-multimedia/podcasts/interviews/freeman-dyson.html|access-date=2011-12-19|title=InterViews Freeman Dyson|date=2004-07-23|publisher=[[National Academy of Sciences]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201035534/http://www.nasonline.org/news-and-multimedia/podcasts/interviews/freeman-dyson.html|archive-date=1 December 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, Dyson joined the board of the [[Solar Electric Light Fund]]. {{As of|2003}} he was president of the [[Space Studies Institute]], the space research organization founded by [[Gerard K. O'Neill]]; {{as of|2013}} he is on its Board of Trustees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ssi.org/about/ssi-officers-and-board/|title=Officers and Board|publisher=Space Studies Institute|access-date=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dyson is a long-time member of the [[JASON (advisory group)|JASON]] group.

Dyson has won numerous scientific awards but never a [[Nobel Prize]]. Nobel physics laureate [[Steven Weinberg]] has said that the [[Nobel Committee for Physics|Nobel committee]] has "fleeced" Dyson, but Dyson himself remarked in 2009, "I think it's almost true without exception if you want to win a Nobel Prize, you should have a long attention span, get hold of some deep and important problem and stay with it for ten years. That wasn't my style."&lt;ref name="civil" /&gt; Dyson is a regular contributor to ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''.

In 2012, he published (with [[William H. Press]]) a fundamental new result about the [[Prisoner's Dilemma]] in [[PNAS]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/05/16/1206569109.full.pdf+html "Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma contains strategies that dominate any evolutionary opponent"]. [[William H. Press]] and Freeman Dyson. ''[[PNAS]]'' vol. 109 no. 26 pp 0409–10413&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family===
With his first wife, the Swiss mathematician [[Verena Huber-Dyson]], Dyson had two children, [[Esther Dyson|Esther]] and [[George Dyson (science historian)|George]]. In 1958, he married Imme Jung, a [[Masters athletics (track and field)|masters runner]], and they had four more children, Dorothy, Mia, Rebecca, and Emily Dyson.&lt;ref name="civil" /&gt;

Dyson's eldest daughter, Esther, is a digital technology consultant and investor; she has been called "the most influential woman in all the computer world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26858383 |title=Esther Dyson: Breaking through tech's glass ceiling|last=McKelvey|first=Tara|date=27 May 2014|access-date=11 February 2017|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His son George is a [[history of science|historian of science]],&lt;ref&gt;See excerpt from [http://www.edge.org/documents/digerati/Dyson.html Digerati: Encounters with the Cyber Elite] by John Brockman (HardWired Books, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; one of whose books is ''[[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)#note-0|Project Orion]]: The Atomic Spaceship 1957–1965''.

===Biotechnology and genetic engineering===
{{quote|My book ''[[The Sun, the Genome and the Internet|The Sun, the Genome, and the Internet]]'' (1999) describes a vision of green technology enriching villages all over the world and halting the migration from villages to megacities. The three components of the vision are all essential: the sun to provide energy where it is needed, the genome to provide plants that can convert sunlight into chemical fuels cheaply and efficiently, the Internet to end the intellectual and economic isolation of rural populations. With all three components in place, every village in Africa could enjoy its fair share of the blessings of civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Dyson, F. (19 July 2007) [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/20370 "Our Biotech Future"], [[New York Review of Books]]. Retrieved on 2011-10-07.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Dyson cheerfully admits his record as a prophet is mixed, but "it is better to be wrong than to be vague."&lt;ref&gt;Dyson, F.J. (1999) ''The Sun, the Genome, and the Internet''&lt;/ref&gt;

"To answer the world's material needs, technology has to be not only beautiful but also cheap."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Dyson, F.J.|1979}}. "The Greening of the Galaxy" in ''Disturbing the Universe''&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Origin of Life''===
Dyson favors the dual origin concept: Life first formed cells, then enzymes, and finally, much later, genes. This was first propounded by the Russian [[Alexander Oparin]].&lt;ref&gt;Oparin, A. I. ''The Origin of Life'', Moscow Worker publisher, 1924 (Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; [[J. B. S. Haldane]] developed the same theory independently.&lt;ref&gt;''The Origin of Life'', J.B.S.Haldane, The Rationalist Annual, 1929&lt;/ref&gt; Dyson has simplified things by saying simply that life evolved in two stages, widely separated in time. He regards it as too unlikely that genes could have developed fully blown in one process, because of the biochemistry. Current cells contain [[adenosine triphosphate]] or ATP and [[adenosine 5'-monophosphate]] or AMP, which greatly resemble each other but have completely different functions. ATP transports energy around the cell, and AMP is part of RNA and the genetic apparatus. Dyson proposes that in a primitive early cell containing ATP and AMP, RNA and replication were invented accidentally because of the similarity between AMP and RNA. He suggests that AMP was produced when ATP molecules lost two of their phosphate radicals, and then one cell somewhere performed [[Manfred Eigen|Eigen]]'s experiment and produced RNA.

Unfortunately there is no direct evidence for the dual origin concept, because once genes developed, they took over, obliterating all traces of the earlier forms of life. In the first origin, the cells were probably just drops of water held together by surface tension, teeming with enzymes and chemical reactions, and a primitive kind of growth or replication. When the liquid drop became too big, it split into two drops. Many complex molecules formed in these "little city economies" and the probability that genes would eventually develop in them was much greater than in the prebiotic environment.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman Dyson, ''Origins of Life,,. Second Edition'', Cambridge University Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Dyson rings.PNG|thumb|Artist's concept of Dyson rings, forming a stable [[Dyson Sphere#Dyson swarm|Dyson swarm]], or "Dyson sphere"]]

===Dyson sphere===
{{Main|Dyson sphere}}
{{quote|One should expect that, within a few thousand years of its entering the stage of industrial development, any intelligent species should be found occupying an artificial biosphere which completely surrounds its parent star.&lt;ref name=DavisInterview&gt;{{cite interview |subject= Freeman Dyson |url=http://www.omnimag.com/archives/interviews/dyson.html |title=Freeman Dyson: Imagine … |interviewer=Monte Davis |date=October 1978 |work=[[Omni (magazine)|OMNI]] |access-date=2006-12-17 |deadurl=usurped |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19981207065016/http://www.omnimag.com/archives/interviews/dyson.html |archivedate=1998-12-07 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1960, Dyson wrote a short paper for the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', titled "Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infrared Radiation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infrared Radiation| doi=10.1126/science.131.3414.1667| journal=Science| volume= 131| pages= 1667–1668| first=Freeman J.| last=Dyson| date=3 June 1960| issue=3414| pmid=17780673| bibcode= 1960Sci...131.1667D }}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, he theorized that a technologically advanced [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial civilization]] might completely surround its native star with artificial structures in order to maximize the capture of the star's available energy. Eventually, the civilization would completely enclose the star, intercepting [[electromagnetic radiation]] with wavelengths from visible light downwards and radiating waste heat outwards as [[infrared]] radiation. Therefore, one method of [[Search for extraterrestrial intelligence|searching for extraterrestrial civilizations]] would be to look for large objects radiating in the infrared range of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].

Dyson conceived that such structures would be clouds of [[asteroid]]-sized [[space habitat]]s, though [[science fiction]] writers have preferred a solid structure: either way, such an artifact is often called a [[Dyson sphere]], although Dyson used the term "shell". Dyson says that he used the term "artificial biosphere" in the article meaning a habitat, not a shape.&lt;ref&gt;20 minutes into [http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=350379535220823176&amp;q=genome a video]&lt;/ref&gt; The general concept of such an energy-transferring shell had been advanced decades earlier by author [[Olaf Stapledon]] in his 1937 novel ''[[Star Maker]]'', a source that Dyson has credited publicly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech | title = Living Through Four Revolutions |first = Freeman | last = Dyson | event = Perimeter Institute Public Lecture Series | location = Waterloo, Ontario, Canada | date = 1 June 2011 | url = https://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/videos/living-through-four-revolutions }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Dyson, F.J.|1979}}. ''Disturbing the Universe'', p. 211, "Some science fiction writers have wrongly given me the credit of inventing the artificial biosphere. In fact, I took the idea from Olaf Stapledon, one of their own colleagues"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dyson tree===
{{Main|Dyson tree}}

Dyson has also proposed the creation of a ''Dyson tree'', a [[genetic engineering|genetically-engineered]] plant capable of growing on a [[comet]]. He suggested that comets could be engineered to contain hollow spaces filled with a breathable atmosphere, thus providing self-sustaining habitats for humanity in the outer [[Solar System]].

{{quote|Plants could grow greenhouses ... just as turtles grow shells and polar bears grow fur and polyps build coral reefs in tropical seas. These plants could keep warm by the light from a distant Sun and conserve the oxygen that they produce by photosynthesis. The greenhouse would consist of a thick skin providing thermal insulation, with small transparent windows to admit sunlight. Outside the skin would be an array of simple lenses, focusing sunlight through the windows into the interior ... Groups of greenhouses could grow together to form extended habitats for other species of plants and animals.&lt;ref name=PlantsFish&gt;Dyson, FJ, "Warm-blooded plants and freeze-dried fish: the future of space exploration.

===Space colonies===
{{quote|I've done some historical research on the costs of the Mayflower's voyage, and on the Mormons' emigration to Utah, and I think it's possible to go into space on a much smaller scale. A cost on the order of $40,000 per person [1978 dollars, $143,254 in 2013 dollars] would be the target to shoot for; in terms of real wages, that would make it comparable to the colonization of America. Unless it's brought down to that level it's not really interesting to me, because otherwise it would be a luxury that only governments could afford.&lt;ref name=DavisInterview /&gt;}}

Dyson has been interested in space travel since he was a child, reading such [[science fiction]] classics as [[Olaf Stapledon]]'s ''[[Star Maker]]''. As a young man, he worked for [[General Atomics]] on the nuclear-powered [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Orion]] spacecraft. He hoped Project Orion would put men on Mars by 1965, Saturn by 1970. He's been unhappy for a quarter-century about how the government conducts space travel:
{{quote|The problem is, of course, that they can't afford to fail. The rules of the game are that you don't take a chance, because if you fail, then probably your whole program gets wiped out.&lt;ref name=DavisInterview /&gt;}}

He still hopes for cheap space travel, but is resigned to waiting for private entrepreneurs to develop something new and inexpensive.

{{quote|No law of physics or biology forbids cheap travel and settlement all over the solar system and beyond. But it is impossible to predict how long this will take. Predictions of the dates of future achievements are notoriously fallible. My guess is that the era of cheap unmanned missions will be the next fifty years, and the era of cheap manned missions will start sometime late in the twenty-first century.

Any affordable program of manned exploration must be centered in biology, and its time frame tied to the time frame of biotechnology; a hundred years, roughly the time it will take us to learn to grow warm-blooded plants, is probably reasonable.&lt;ref name=PlantsFish /&gt;}}

Dyson also proposed the use of bioengineered space colonies to colonize the Kuiper Belt on the outer edge of our Solar System. He proposed that habitats could be grown from space hardened spores. The colonies could then be warmed by large reflector plant leaves that could focus the dim, distant sunlight back on the growing colony. This was illustrated by Pat Rawlings on the cover of the National Space Society's Ad Astra magazine.

===Space exploration===
{{quote|A direct search for life in Europa's ocean would today be prohibitively expensive. Impacts on Europa give us an easier way to look for evidence of life there. Every time a major impact occurs on Europa, a vast quantity of water is splashed from the ocean into the space around Jupiter. Some of the water evaporates, and some condenses into snow. Creatures living in the water far enough from the impact have a chance of being splashed intact into space and quickly freeze-dried. Therefore, an easy way to look for evidence of life in Europa's ocean is to look for freeze-dried fish in the ring of space debris orbiting Jupiter.

Freeze-dried fish orbiting Jupiter is a fanciful notion, but nature in the biological realm has a tendency to be fanciful. Nature is usually more imaginative than we are. ... To have the best chance of success, we should keep our eyes open for all possibilities.&lt;ref name=PlantsFish /&gt;}}

===Dyson's eternal intelligence===
{{Main|Dyson's eternal intelligence}}
Dyson's proposal that intelligent beings may be capable of thinking an infinite number of thoughts in an open/ expanding universe.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman J. Dyson, [http://www.aleph.se/Trans/Global/Omega/dyson.txt "Time without end: Physics and biology in an open universe,"] ''Reviews of Modern Physics'', Vol. 51, Issue 3 (July 1979), pp. 447-460; {{doi|10.1103/RevModPhys.51.447}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dyson's transform===
{{Main|Dyson's transform}}
Dyson also has some credits in pure mathematics. His concept "Dyson's transform" led to one of the most important [[lemma (mathematics)|lemmas]] of [[Olivier Ramaré]]'s theorem that every even integer can be written as a sum of no more than six primes.

===Dyson series===
The [[Dyson series]], the formal solution of an explicitly time-dependent [[Schrödinger equation]] by iteration, and the corresponding Dyson time-ordering operator &lt;math&gt;\mathcal T\,,&lt;/math&gt; an entity of basic importance in the [[mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics]], are also named after Dyson.

===Quantum physics and prime numbers===
Dyson and [[Hugh Montgomery (mathematician)|Hugh Montgomery]] discovered together an intriguing connection between quantum physics and [[Montgomery's pair correlation conjecture]] about the zeros of the Zeta function. The primes 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, ... are described by the [[Riemann Zeta function]], and Dyson had previously developed a description of quantum physics based on m by m arrays of totally random numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dyson | first1 = Freeman J. | year = 1962 | title = A Brownian?Motion Model for the Eigenvalues of a Random Matrix | url = | journal = J. Math. Phys. | volume = 3 | issue = 6| page = 1191 | doi = 10.1063/1.1703862 |bibcode = 1962JMP.....3.1191D }}&lt;/ref&gt;  What Montgomery and Dyson discovered is that the ''[[eigenvalues]]'' of these matrices are spaced apart in exactly the same manner as Montgomery conjectured for the nontrivial zeros of the Zeta function. [[Andrew Odlyzko]] has verified the conjecture on a computer, using his  [[Odlyzko–Schönhage algorithm]] to calculate many zeros. Dyson recognized this connection because of a number-theory question Montgomery asked him. Dyson had published results in [[number theory]] in 1947, while a Fellow at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] and so was able to understand Montgomery's question. If Montgomery had not been visiting the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] that week, this connection might not have been discovered.

There are in nature one, two, and three dimensional [[quasicrystals]]. Mathematicians define a quasicrystal as a set of discrete points whose [[Fourier transform]] is also a set of discrete points. [[Andrew Odlyzko]] has done extensive computations of the Fourier transform of the nontrivial zeros of the [[Riemann Zeta function]], and they seem to form a one dimensional quasicrystal. This would in fact follow from the [[Riemann hypothesis]].&lt;ref&gt;Freeman Dyson, Selected papers, 1990-2014, pp. 41–42, World Scientific, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views==

===Metaphysics===
Dyson has suggested a kind of cosmic metaphysics of [[mind]]. In his book ''[[Infinite in All Directions]]'' he writes about three levels of mind: "The universe shows evidence of the operations of mind on three levels. The first level is the level of elementary physical processes in quantum mechanics. Matter in quantum mechanics is ... constantly making choices between alternative possibilities according to probabilistic laws. ... The second level at which we detect the operations of mind is the level of direct human experience. ... [I]t is reasonable to believe in the existence of a third level of mind, a mental component of the universe. If we believe in this mental component and call it God, then we can say that we are small pieces of God's mental apparatus" (p.&amp;nbsp;297).

===Climate change===
Dyson agrees that anthropogenic [[global warming]] exists. While he agrees that "[one] of the main causes of warming is the increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere resulting from our burning of fossil fuels such as oil and coal and natural gas",&lt;ref name="heretic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/dysonf07/dysonf07_index.html|publisher=Edge|title=Heretical Thoughts about Science and Society|date=8 August 2007|author=Freeman Dyson|access-date=2007-09-05}}dl&lt;/ref&gt; he believes that existing simulation models of climate fail to account for some important factors, and hence the results will contain too much error to reliably predict future trends:

{{quote|The models solve the equations of fluid dynamics, and they do a very good job of describing the fluid motions of the atmosphere and the oceans. They do a very poor job of describing the clouds, the dust, the chemistry and the biology of fields and farms and forests. They do not begin to describe the real world we live in&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref name="heretic" /&gt;}}

and, in 2009:

{{quote|What has happened in the past 10 years is that the discrepancies between what's observed and what's predicted have become much stronger. It's clear now the models are wrong, but it wasn't so clear 10 years ago.&lt;ref name=dy8&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/10/11/freeman_dyson_interview/ "Top boffin Freeman Dyson on climate change, interstellar travel, fusion, and more"], interview published 2 June 2009 by [[The Register]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He is among signatories of a letter to the UN criticizing the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases-all?ID=d4b5fd23-802a-23ad-4565-3dce4095c360 |title=Don't fight, adapt |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher= |dead-url=yes |access-date=19 August 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160911074152/http://www.epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases-all?ID=d4b5fd23-802a-23ad-4565-3dce4095c360 |archivedate=11 September 2016 |df=dmy }} Open Letter to the Secretary-General of the United Nations.

"[H]eretics who question the dogmas are needed&amp;nbsp; ... I am proud to be a heretic. The world always needs heretics to challenge the prevailing orthodoxies."&lt;ref name="heretic" /&gt;

Dyson says his views on global warming have been strongly criticized. In reply, he notes that "[m]y objections to the global warming propaganda are not so much over the technical facts, about which I do not know much, but it's rather against the way those people behave and the kind of intolerance to criticism that a lot of them have."&lt;ref name=e360&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090608114821/http://www.e360.yale.edu/content/feature.msp?id=2151 "Freeman Dyson Takes On The Climate Establishment"], interview published 2 June 2009 by [[Yale University]]'s ''Environment 360''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, he endorsed the now common usage of "global warming" as synonymous with global anthropogenic climate change, referring to "measurements that transformed global warming from a vague theoretical speculation into a precise observational science."&lt;ref&gt;Dyson, F. (12 June 2008) [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/21494 "The Question of Global Warming"], The New York Review of Books. Retrieved on 2011-10-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

He has, however, argued that political efforts to reduce the causes of climate change distract from other global problems that should take priority:

{{quote|I'm not saying the warming doesn't cause problems, obviously it does. Obviously we should be trying to understand it. I'm saying that the problems are being grossly exaggerated. They take away money and attention from other problems that are much more urgent and important. Poverty, infectious diseases, public education and public health. Not to mention the preservation of living creatures on land and in the oceans.&lt;ref name="um"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060831094244/http://www.umich.edu/news/index.html?DysonWinCom05|archivedate=31 August 2006 |url=http://www.umich.edu/news/index.html?DysonWinCom05|title= University of Michigan 2005 Winter Commencement Address|publisher=University of Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In an opinion piece in the Boston Globe of 3 Dec 2015 he wrote,

{{quote|[T]he environmental movement [has been] hijacked by a bunch of climate fanatics, who have captured the attention of the public with scare stories. ...

China and India have a simple choice to make. Either they get rich [by burning prodigious quantities of coal and causing] a major increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide, or they stay poor. I hope they choose to get rich. ...

The good news is that the main effect of carbon dioxide ... is to make the planet greener, [by] feeding the growth of green plants of all kinds [and] increasing the fertility of farms and fields and forests."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dyson|first1=Freeman|title=Misunderstandings, questionable beliefs mar Paris climate talks|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2015/12/03/freeman-dyson-misunderstandings-questionable-beliefs-mar-paris-climate-talks/vG3oBrbmcZlv2m22DTNjMP/story.html|access-date=7 December 2015|publisher=''Boston Globe''|date=3 Dec 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Since originally taking interest in climate studies in the 1970s, Dyson has suggested that [[carbon dioxide]] levels in the atmosphere could be controlled by planting fast-growing trees. He calculates that it would take a trillion trees to remove all carbon from the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman J. Dyson, "Can we control the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere?", Energy, Volume 2, Issue 3, September 1977, Pages 287–291. {{doi|10.1016/0360-5442(77)90033-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="civil"/&gt;

In a 2014 interview, he said that "What I'm convinced of is that we don't understand climate ...  It will take a lot of very hard work before that question is settled."&lt;ref name=wired20140331&gt;

===Nuclear winter===
From his 1988 book ''[[Infinite in All Directions]]'', he offered some criticism of then current models predicting a devastating [[nuclear winter]] in the event of a large-scale nuclear war:

{{quote|As a scientist I want to rip the theory of nuclear winter apart, but as a human being I want to believe it.  This is one of the rare instances of a genuine conflict between the demands of science and the demands of humanity.  As a scientist, I judge the nuclear winter theory to be a sloppy piece of work, full of gaps and unjustified assumptions.  As a human being, I hope fervently that it is right.  Here is a real and uncomfortable dilemma.  What does a scientist do when science and humanity pull in opposite directions?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Freeman J. Dyson|title=Infinite in All Directions: Gifford Lectures Given at Aberdeen, Scotland April—November 1985|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ca3OH0a4tZoC&amp;pg=PA259|access-date=8 October 2011|date=22 July 2004|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-072889-2|pages=259–}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Warfare and weapons===

At the [[British Bomber Command]], Dyson and colleagues proposed removing two gun turrets from the RAF [[Lancaster bomber]]s, to cut the catastrophic losses due to German fighters in the [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II|Battle of Berlin]]. A Lancaster without turrets could fly {{convert|50|mph|-1|abbr=on}} faster and be much more maneuverable.

{{quote|All our advice to the commander in chief [went] through the chief of our section, who was a career civil servant. His guiding principle was to tell the commander in chief things that the commander in chief liked to hear ... To push the idea of ripping out gun turrets, against the official mythology of the gallant gunner defending his crew mates ... was not the kind of suggestion the commander in chief liked to hear.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Dyson, F.J.|1979}}. "The Children's Crusade" in ''Disturbing the Universe''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On hearing the news of the bombing of [[Hiroshima]]:

{{quote|I agreed emphatically with [[Henry Stimson]]. Once we had got ourselves into the business of bombing cities, we might as well do the job competently and get it over with. I felt better that morning than I had felt for years ... Those fellows who had built the atomic bombs obviously knew their stuff ... Later, much later, I would remember [the downside].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Dyson, F.J.|1979}}. "The Blood of a Poet" in ''Disturbing the Universe''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|I am convinced that to avoid nuclear war it is not sufficient to be afraid of it. It is necessary to be afraid, but it is equally necessary to understand. And the first step in understanding is to recognize that the problem of nuclear war is basically not technical but human and historical. If we are to avoid destruction we must first of all understand the human and historical context out of which destruction arises.&lt;ref&gt;Dyson, F.J. (1984) ''Weapons and Hope''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1967, in his capacity as a military adviser Dyson wrote an influential paper on the issue of possible US use of tactical nuclear weapons in the [[Vietnam War]]. When a general said in a meeting, "I think it might be a good idea to throw in a nuke now and then, just to keep the other side guessing ..."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Dyson, F.J.|1979}}. "The Ethics of Defense" in ''Disturbing the Universe'', p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; Dyson became alarmed and obtained permission to write an objective report discussing the pros and cons of using such weapons from a purely military point of view. (This report, ''Tactical Nuclear Weapons in Southeast Asia'', published by the [[Institute for Defense Analyses]], was obtained, with some redactions, by the [[Nautilus Institute for Security and Sustainability]] under the [[Freedom of Information act]] in 2002.)&lt;ref&gt;F.J. Dyson, R. Gomer, S. Weinberg, S.C. Wright [http://nautilus.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/tactical_nukes_vietnam.pdf "Tactical Nuclear Weapons in Southeast Asia"] (March 1967) [declassified December 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; It was sufficiently objective that both sides in the debate based their arguments on it. Dyson says that the report showed that, even from a narrow military point of view, the US was better off not using nuclear weapons. Dyson stated on the [[Dick Cavett show]] that the use of nuclear weaponry was a bad idea for the US at the time because "our targets were large and theirs were small." (His unstated assumption was that the Soviets would respond by supplying tactical nukes to the other side.)

Dyson opposed the [[Vietnam War]], the [[Gulf War]] and the [[invasion of Iraq]]. He supported [[Barack Obama]] in the [[2008 US presidential election]] and ''[[The New York Times]]'' has described him as a [[Modern liberalism in the United States|political liberal]].&lt;ref name=civil /&gt; He was one of 29 leading US scientists who wrote a strongly supportive letter to Obama regarding his administration's 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.&lt;ref name = "29 support letter"&gt;{{Cite web | last = Broad | first = William J. | date = 8 August 2015 | title = 29 U.S. Scientists Praise Iran Nuclear Deal in Letter to Obama | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/09/world/29-us-scientists-praise-iran-nuclear-deal-in-letter-to-obama.html | work = The New York Times | access-date = 9 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil defence===
While teaching for a few weeks in Zurich, Dyson was visited by two officials from the Swiss civil defence authority. Their experts were telling them that fairly simple shelters on a large scale would enable them to survive a nuclear attack, and they wanted confirmation. They knew that Dyson had a security clearance. Dyson reassured them that their shelters would do the job. The US does not build such shelters because it would be contrary to the doctrine of [[mutual assured destruction]], since the US would be able to launch a first strike but survive retaliation.&lt;ref&gt;Dyson, F.J.

===On English academics===
{{quote|My view of the prevalence of doom-and-gloom in [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] is that it is a result of the English class system.  In England there were always two sharply opposed middle classes, the academic middle class and the commercial middle class. In the nineteenth century, the academic middle class won the battle for power and status.  As a child of the academic middle class, I learned to look on the commercial middle class with loathing and contempt.  Then came the triumph of [[Margaret Thatcher]], which was also the revenge of the commercial middle class.  The academics lost their power and prestige and the business people took over. The academics never forgave Thatcher and have been gloomy ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.staff.livjm.ac.uk/spsbpeis/Freeman-Dyson.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703082513/http://www.staff.livjm.ac.uk/spsbpeis/Freeman-Dyson.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=3 July 2007|

===Science and religion===
He is a [[Nondenominational Christianity|nondenominational Christian]] and has attended various churches from [[Presbyterian]] to [[Roman Catholic]]. Regarding doctrinal or [[Christological]] issues, he has said, "I am neither a saint nor a theologian. To me, good works are more important than theology."&lt;ref name="edge68.html"&gt;{{cite speech |url=https://www.edge.org/documents/archive/edge68.html |author= Freeman Dyson |event=Templeton Prize Lecture |title=Progress In Religion |via=[[Edge.org]] |date=15 March 2000 |access-date=2011-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Science and religion are two windows that people look through, trying to understand the big universe outside, trying to understand why we are here. The two windows give different views, but they look out at the same universe. Both views are one-sided, neither is complete. Both leave out essential features of the real world. And both are worthy of respect.

Trouble arises when either science or religion claims universal jurisdiction, when either religious or scientific dogma claims to be infallible. Religious creationists and scientific materialists are equally dogmatic and insensitive. By their arrogance they bring both science and religion into disrepute. The media exaggerate their numbers and importance. The media rarely mention the fact that the great majority of religious people belong to moderate denominations that treat science with respect, or the fact that the great majority of scientists treat religion with respect so long as religion does not claim jurisdiction over scientific questions.&lt;ref name="edge68.html" /&gt;}}

Dyson partially disagrees with the famous remark by his fellow physicist [[Steven Weinberg]] that "With or without religion, good people can behave well and bad people can do evil; but for good people to do evil—that takes religion."&lt;ref name="nyrb06.html"&gt;{{cite web |title=Religion from the Outside |author=Freeman Dyson |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/19090 |date=22 June 2006 |work=The New York Review of Books |access-date=2011-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Weinberg's statement is true as far as it goes, but it is not the  whole truth. To make it the whole truth, we must add an additional clause: "And for bad people to do good things—that [also] takes religion." The main point of Christianity is that it is a religion for sinners. Jesus made that very clear. When the Pharisees asked his disciples, "Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners?" he said, "I come to call not the righteous but sinners to repentance." Only a small fraction of sinners repent and do good things but only a small fraction of good people are led by their religion to do bad things.&lt;ref name="nyrb06.html" /&gt;}}

While Dyson has labeled himself a Christian, he identifies himself as agnostic about some of the specifics of his faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Back to Hell |publisher=Xulon Press |isbn=9781591608158 |author=Moses Gbenu |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R8aLHpyW7vEC&amp;pg=PA110#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=110 |quote=The cash part of this award is over $1 million.

But I find Polkinghorne's theology altogether too narrow for my taste. I have no use for a theology that claims to know the answers to deep questions but bases its arguments on the beliefs of a single tribe. I am a practicing Christian but not a believing Christian. To me, to worship God means to recognize that mind and intelligence are woven into the fabric of our universe in a way that altogether surpasses our comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Science &amp; Religion: No Ends in Sight |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2002/mar/28/science-religion-no-ends-in-sight/ |work=The New York Review of Books|access-date=30 July 2012|author=Freeman Dyson|date=28 March 2002|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''[[The God Delusion]]'' (2006), biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] criticized Dyson for accepting the religious [[Templeton Prize]] in 2000; "It would be taken as an endorsement of religion by one of the world's most distinguished physicists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The God Delusion |last=Dawkins|first=Richard|publisher=[[Bantam Press]]|year=2006|isbn=978-0-61868-000-9|page=152|title-link=The God Delusion}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Dyson declared in 2000 that he is a (non-denominational) Christian,&lt;ref name="edge68.html"/&gt; and he has disagreed with Dawkins on several occasions, as when he criticized Dawkins' understanding of [[evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=John Brockman |url=http://www.edge.org/discourse/dawkins_dyson.html |title=Richard Dawkins—Freeman Dyson: an exchange |year=2007 |website=[[Edge.org]]|access-date=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5959">'''Frege's puzzles''' are puzzles about the [[semantics]] of [[proper name]]s, although related puzzles also arise in the case of [[indexical]]s. [[Gottlob Frege]] (1848–1925) introduced the puzzle at the beginning of his article "Über Sinn und Bedeutung" ("[[On Sense and Reference]]") in 1892 in one of the most influential articles in [[analytic philosophy]] and [[philosophy of language]].

==The puzzles ==

The term "Frege's puzzle" is commonly applied to two related problems.  One is a problem about identity statements that Frege raised at the beginning of "On Sense and Reference", and another concerns propositional attitude reports.&lt;ref&gt;Zalta, Edward N., "[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2014/entries/frege/ Gottlob Frege]", ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' (Fall 2014), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;  For the first problem, consider the following two sentences:

(1) [[Hesperus]] is Hesperus.

(2) Hesperus is [[Phosphorus (morning star)|Phosphorus]].

Each of these sentences is true, since 'Hesperus' refers to the same object as 'Phosphorus' (the planet Venus). Nonetheless, (1) and (2) seem to differ in their meaning or what Frege called "cognitive value". (1) is just a truth of logic that can be known [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]], whereas (2) records an empirical truth that was discovered by astronomers. The problem, however, is that proper names are often taken to have no meaning beyond their reference (a view often associated with [[John Stuart Mill]]). But this seems to imply that the two statements mean the same thing, or have the same cognitive value.&lt;ref&gt;Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2017). Lexemes, practs, and those who have yet to decide. Linguistik Online, 81, 77-93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2018). Which view of indirect reports do Persian data corroborate? International Review of Pragmatics, 10(1), 76-100. &lt;/ref&gt;

Frege proposed to resolve this puzzle by postulating a second level of meaning besides reference in the form of what he called [[Sense and reference|sense]]: a difference in the mode of presentation or the way an object can be "given" to us.  Thus 'Hesperus' and 'Phosphorus' have the same reference, but differ in sense because they present Venus in different ways.

The second puzzle concerns [[propositional attitude]] reports, such as belief reports.  Ordinarily, coreferring names are substitutable [[salva veritate]], that is, without change in truth value.  For example, if 'Hesperus is bright' is true then 'Phosphorus is bright' is also true given that 'Hesperus' and 'Phosphorus' refer to the same planet.  But now consider the following argument:

(3) Alex believes Hesperus is visible in the evening.

(4) Hesperus = Phosphorus.

(5) Alex believes Phosphorus is visible in the evening.

This argument appears to be [[Validity (logic)|invalid]]: even if (3) and (4) are true, (5) could be false.  If Alex is not aware that Hesperus and Phosphorus are the same planet, then it seems that he could believe that Hesperus is visible in the evening while rejecting the claim that Phosphorus is visible in the evening (perhaps he thinks Phosphorus, the morning star, is only visible in the morning).  The principle that coreferring names are substitutable ''salva veritate'' thus appears to fail in the context of belief reports (and similarly for other propositional attitude reports).

Frege again proposed to solve this problem by appeal to his distinction between sense and reference.  In particular, he held that when a proper name occurs in the context of an attitude report, its reference shifts to its ordinary sense: thus 'Phosphorus', for example, denotes the planet Venus when it occurs in the sentence 'Phosphorus is visible in the evening' or in an identity sentence like (4), but when it occurs embedded in an attitude report like (5) it denotes its ordinary ''sense.''

==New theories of reference and the return of Frege's puzzle==

Frege's puzzle has received a great deal of attention since the attacks on the [[descriptivist theory of names]] mounted in the 1970s and 1980s by philosophers such as [[Keith Donnellan]], [[Saul Kripke]], [[Ruth Barcan Marcus]], [[Hilary Putnam]], and [[David Kaplan (philosopher)|David Kaplan]].&lt;ref&gt;Cumming, S. "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/names/ Names]", ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the wake of these attacks on descriptivism, many philosophers embraced the Millian or direct-reference view of proper names, according to which the meaning of a name is simply its referent. As noted above, this Millian view has the result that (1) and (2) express the same proposition.  Similarly, the embedded sentences 'Hesperus is visible in the evening' and 'Phosphorus is visible in the evening' from (3) and (5) express the same proposition.  It therefore looks like (3) and (5) cannot differ in truth value since they attribute belief in one and the same proposition.

In view of this problem, many philosophers of language have attempted to work out a solution to the puzzle within the confines of direct-reference theories of proper names. Some of these philosophers include [[Nathan Salmon]] (e.g. in ''Frege's puzzle'' and ''Content, Cognition, and Communication''), [[Howard Wettstein]] (e.g. in "Has Semantics Rested on a Mistake?"), [[Scott Soames]], [[David Kaplan (philosopher)|David Kaplan]], [[John Perry (philosopher)|John Perry]] (e.g. in ''Reference and Reflexivity''), and [[Joseph Almog]].

The '''Rationality Debate'''—also called the '''Great Rationality Debate'''—is the question of whether humans are [[rationality|rational]] or not. This issue is a topic in the study of [[cognition]] and is important in fields such as [[economics]] where it is relevant to the theories of [[market efficiency]].

Many studies in [[experimental psychology]] have shown that humans often [[reason]] in a way that is inaccurate or imperfect—that they do not naturally chose the ideal method or solution.{{sfn|Stanovich|West|Toplak|2011|p=356}} An example of a problem which causes difficulty and debate is the [[St. Petersburg paradox]].{{sfn|Stanovich|West|Toplak|2011|p=360}} This is a lottery which is constructed so that the [[expected value]] is infinite but unlikely so that most people will not pay a large fee to play. [[Gerd Gigerenzer]] explained that, in this case, mathematicians refined their formulae to model this pragmatic behaviour.{{sfn|Gigerenzer|1991|p=21}} [[Keith Stanovich]] characterizes this as a [[Panglossian]] position in the debate—that humans are fundamentally rational and any variance between the [[normative]] position and empirical outcomes may be explained by such adjustments.{{sfn|Stanovich|West|Toplak|2011|p=361}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24340">'''Gödel's ontological proof''' is a formal argument by the mathematician [[Kurt Gödel]] (1906–1978) for [[God]]'s existence. More precisely, it presupposes the notion of ''positive'' and ''negative'' properties, and proves the necessary existence of an object which each positive property, but no negative property, applies to.

The argument is in a line of development that goes back to [[Anselm of Canterbury]] (1033–1109).  St. Anselm's [[ontological argument]], in its most succinct form, is as follows: "God, by definition, is that for which no greater can be conceived. God exists in the understanding. If God exists in the understanding, we could imagine Him to be greater by existing in [[reality]]. Therefore, God must exist." A more elaborate version was given by [[Gottfried Leibniz]] (1646–1716); this is the version that Gödel studied and attempted to clarify with his ontological argument.

Gödel left a fourteen-point outline of his philosophical beliefs in his papers.&lt;ref&gt;In: Wang, Hao. ''A Logical Journey: From Gödel to Philosophy.'' A Bradford Book, 1997. Print. p.316.&lt;/ref&gt; Points relevant to the ontological proof include
:4. There are other worlds and rational beings of a different and higher kind.
:5. The world in which we live is not the only one in which we shall live or have lived.
:13. There is a scientific (exact) philosophy and theology, which deals with concepts of the highest abstractness; and this is also most highly fruitful for science.
:14. Religions are, for the most part, bad—but religion is not.

== History ==
The first version of the ontological proof in Gödel's papers is dated "around 1941". Gödel is not known to have told anyone about his work on the proof until 1970, when he thought he was dying. In February, he allowed [[Dana Scott]] to copy out a version of the proof, which circulated privately. In August 1970, Gödel told [[Oskar Morgenstern]] that he was "satisfied" with the proof, but Morgenstern recorded in his diary entry for 29 August 1970, that Gödel would not publish because he was afraid that others might think "that he actually believes in God, whereas he is only engaged in a logical investigation (that is, in showing that such a proof with classical assumptions (completeness, etc.) correspondingly axiomatized, is possible)."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gödel 1995, p. 388. The German original is quoted in Dawson 1997, p. 307. The nested parentheses are in Morgenstern's original diary entry, as quoted by Dawson.&lt;/ref&gt; Gödel died January 14, 1978. Another version, slightly different from Scott's, was found in his papers. It was finally published, together with Scott's version, in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;The publication history of the proof in this paragraph is from Gödel 1995, p. 388&lt;/ref&gt;

Morgenstern's diary is an important and usually reliable source for Gödel's later years, but the implication of the August 1970 diary entry—that Gödel did not believe in God—is not consistent with the other evidence. In letters to his mother, who was not a churchgoer and had raised Kurt and his brother as freethinkers,&lt;ref&gt;Dawson 1997, pp. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Gödel argued at length for a belief in an afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;Dawson 1997, pp. 210–212.&lt;/ref&gt; He did the same in an interview with a skeptical [[Hao Wang (academic)|Hao Wang]], who said: "I expressed my doubts as G spoke [...] Gödel smiled as he replied to my questions, obviously aware that his answers were not convincing me."&lt;ref&gt;Wang 1996, p. 317. The ellipsis is Wikipedia's.&lt;/ref&gt; Wang reports that Gödel's wife, Adele, two days after Gödel's death, told Wang that "Gödel, although he did not go to church, was religious and read the Bible in bed every Sunday morning."&lt;ref&gt;Wang 1996, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; In an unmailed answer to a questionnaire, Gödel described his religion as "baptized Lutheran (but not member of any religious congregation). My belief is ''[[Theism|theistic]]'', not [[Pantheism|pantheistic]], following [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] rather than [[Spinoza]]."&lt;ref group=note&gt;Gödel's answer to a special questionnaire sent him by the sociologist Burke Grandjean. This answer is quoted directly in Wang 1987, p. 18, and indirectly in Wang 1996, p. 112. It's also quoted directly in Dawson 1997, p. 6,
who cites Wang 1987.

The Grandjean questionnaire is perhaps the most extended autobiographical item in Gödel's papers. Gödel filled it out in pencil and wrote a cover letter, but he never returned it. "Theistic" is italicized in both Wang 1987 and Wang 1996. It is possible that this italicization is Wang's and not Gödel's.

The quote follows Wang 1987, with two corrections taken from Wang 1996. Wang 1987 reads "Baptist Lutheran" where Wang 1996 has "baptized Lutheran". "Baptist Lutheran" makes no sense, especially in context, and was presumably a typo or mistranscription. Wang 1987 has "rel. cong.", which in Wang 1996 is expanded to "religious congregation".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outline==

The proof uses [[modal logic]], which distinguishes between [[logical truth|''necessary'' truths]] and [[Contingency (philosophy)|''contingent'' truths]]. In the most common semantics for modal logic, many "[[Modal logic#Semantics|possible worlds]]" are considered. A [[truth]] is ''necessary'' if it is true in all possible worlds. By contrast, a truth is ''contingent'' if it just happens to be the case. For instance, "more than half of this planet is covered by water" is a contingent truth, that relies upon which planet "this planet" is. If a statement happens to be true in our world, but is false in another world, then it is a contingent truth. A statement that is true in some world (not necessarily our own) is called a ''[[logically possible|possible]]'' truth.

Furthermore, the proof uses [[higher-order logic|higher-order]] (modal) logic because the definition of God employs an explicit quantification over properties.&lt;ref&gt;Fitting, 2002, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

First, Gödel axiomatizes the notion of a "positive property":&lt;ref group=note&gt;This assumes that it is possible to single out ''positive'' properties from among all properties. Gödel comments that "Positive means positive in the [[moral]] [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] sense (independently of the accidental structure of the world)... It may also mean pure ''attribution'' as opposed to ''privation'' (or containing privation)." (Gödel 1995), see also manuscript in (Gawlick 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; for each property ''φ'', either ''φ'' or its [[negation]] ¬''φ'' must be positive, but not both (axiom 2). If a positive property ''φ'' implies a property ''ψ'' in each possible world, then ''ψ'' is positive, too (axiom 1). Gödel then argues that each positive property is "possibly exemplified", i.e. applies at least to some object in some world (theorem 1). Defining an object to be Godlike if it has all positive properties (definition 1), and requiring that property to be positive itself (axiom 3),&lt;ref group=note&gt;Axioms 1, 2 and 3 can be summarized by saying that positive properties form a principal [[ultrafilter]].&lt;/ref&gt; Gödel shows that in ''some'' possible world a Godlike object exists (theorem 2), called "God" in the following.&lt;ref group=note&gt;By removing all modal operators from axioms, definitions, proofs, and theorems, a modified version of theorem 2 is obtained saying "∃''x'' ''G''(''x'')", i.e. "There exists an object which has all positive, but no negative properties". Nothing more than axioms 1-3, definition 1, and theorems 1-2 needs to be considered for this result.&lt;/ref&gt; Gödel proceeds to prove that a Godlike object exists in ''every'' possible world.

To this end, he defines ''essences'': if ''x'' is an object in some world, then a property ''φ'' is said to be an essence of ''x'' if ''φ''(''x'') is true in that world and if ''φ'' necessarily entails all other properties that ''x'' has in that world (definition 2). Requiring positive properties being positive in every possible world (axiom 4), Gödel can show that Godlikeness is an essence of a Godlike object (theorem 3). Now, ''x'' is said to ''exist necessarily'' if, for every essence ''φ'' of ''x'', there is an element ''y'' with property ''φ'' in every possible world (definition 3). Axiom 5 requires necessary existence to be a positive property.

Hence, it must follow from Godlikeness. Moreover, Godlikeness is an essence of God, since it entails all positive properties, and any non-positive property is the negation of some positive property, so God cannot have any non-positive properties. Since necessary existence is also a positive property (axiom 5), it must be a property of every Godlike object, as every Godlike object has all the positive properties (definition 1). Since any Godlike object is necessarily existent, it follows that any Godlike object in one world is a Godlike object in all worlds, by the definition of necessary existence. Given the existence of a Godlike object in one world, proven above, we may conclude that there is a Godlike object in every possible world, as required (theorem 4). Besides axiom 1-5 and definition 1-3, a few other axioms from modal logic{{clarify|reason=They should be stated.|date=August 2016}} were tacitly used in the proof.

From these hypotheses, it is also possible to prove that there is only one God in each world by Leibniz's law, the [[identity of indiscernibles]]: two or more objects are identical (the same) if they have all their properties in common, and so, there would only be one object in each world that possesses property G. Gödel did not attempt to do so however, as he purposely limited his proof to the issue of existence, rather than uniqueness.

There is an ongoing open-source effort to formalize Gödel's proof to a level that is suitable for [[automated theorem proving]] or at least computer verification via [[proof assistant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/FormalTheology/GoedelGod&lt;/ref&gt;  The effort made headlines in German newspapers. According to the authors of this effort, they were inspired by [[Melvin Fitting]]'s book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Knight|first=David|title=Scientists Use Computer to Mathematically Prove Gödel's God Theorem|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/scientists-use-computer-to-mathematically-prove-goedel-god-theorem-a-928668.html|accessdate=28 October 2013|newspaper=Der Spiegel|date=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Most criticism of Gödel's proof is aimed at its axioms: As with any proof in any logical system, if the axioms the proof depends on are doubted, then the conclusions can be doubted. This is particularly applicable to Gödel's proof – because it rests on five axioms, some of which are questionable. A proof does not necessitate that the conclusion be correct, but rather that by accepting the axioms, the conclusion follows logically.

Many philosophers have questioned the axioms. The first layer of attack is simply that there are no arguments presented that give reasons why the axioms are true. A second layer is that these particular axioms lead to unwelcome conclusions. This line of thought was argued by [[Jordan Howard Sobel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Jordan Howard Sobel | authorlink=Jordan Howard Sobel|contribution=Gödel's ontological proof | pages=241–261 | isbn=978-0262200639 | editor=Judith Jarvis Thomson |editorlink=Judith Jarvis Thomson | title=On Being and Saying: Essays for Richard Cartwright | location=Cambridge/MA &amp; London, England | publisher=MIT Press | date=Nov 1987 }}&lt;/ref&gt; showing that if the axioms are accepted, they lead to a "modal collapse" where every statement that is true is necessarily true, i.e. the sets of necessary, of contingent, and of possible truths all coincide (provided there are [[accessibility relation|accessible]] worlds at all).&lt;ref group=note&gt;Formally, &lt;math&gt;p \Rightarrow \Box p&lt;/math&gt; for all ''p'' implies &lt;math&gt;\Diamond p \Rightarrow p&lt;/math&gt; for all ''p'' by [[indirect proof]], and &lt;math&gt;\Box p \Rightarrow \Diamond p&lt;/math&gt; holds for all ''p'' whenever there are accessible worlds.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Koons,&lt;ref name="Koons.2005"/&gt;{{rp|9}} Sobel suggested that Gödel might have welcomed modal collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn=0-19-507255-3 | url=https://monoskop.org/images/a/aa/Kurt_G%C3%B6del_Collected_Works_Volume_III_1995.pdf | author=Kurt Gödel |editor1 = Solomon Feferman | editor2= John W.

Rather, &lt;math&gt;\varphi(x) \Rightarrow \Box \varphi(x)&lt;/math&gt; should follow first from the existence of God."'' The note might indicate that Gödel was aware of his axioms implying modal collapse.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are suggested amendments to the proof, presented by [[C. Anthony Anderson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://appearedtoblogly.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/anderson-anthony-c-22some-emendations-of-gc3b6dels-ontological-proof22.pdf | author=Curtis Anthony Anderson | authorlink=Curtis Anthony Anderson | title=Some Emendations of Gödel's Ontological Proof | journal=[[Faith and Philosophy]] | volume=7 | number=3 | pages=291&amp;mdash;303 | date=Jul 1990 | doi=10.5840/faithphil19907325}}&lt;/ref&gt; but argued to be refutable by Anderson and Michael Gettings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | contributionurl=https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.lnl/1235417020 | author=Curtis Anthony Anderson and Michael Gettings | contribution=Gödel's ontological proof revisited | editor=Petr Hájek | title=Proc.

Gödel's proof has also been questioned by [[Graham Oppy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/31121878_Godelian_ontological_arguments | author=Graham Oppy | authorlink=Graham Oppy | title=Godelian ontological arguments | journal=Analysis | volume=54 | number=4 | pages=226&amp;mdash;230 | date=Oct 1996 | doi = 10.1093/analys/56.4.226 }} &amp;mdash; [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Graham_Oppy/publication/31121878_Godelian_ontological_arguments/links/0f3175343e378809ad000000.pdf?origin=publication_detail Longer version (2005)]&lt;/ref&gt; asking whether lots of other almost-gods would also be "proven" by Gödel's axioms. This counter-argument has been questioned by Gettings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gettings Michael | year = 1999 | title = Gödel's ontological argument: a reply to Oppy | url = | journal = Analysis | volume = 59 | issue = 264| pages = 309–313 | doi=10.1111/1467-8284.00184}}&lt;/ref&gt; who agrees that the axioms might be questioned, but disagrees that Oppy's particular counter-example can be shown from Gödel's axioms.

Religious scholars such as [[Robert Spitzer (priest)|Fr. Robert J. Spitzer]] have accepted Gödel's proof, calling it "an improvement over the Anselmian Ontological Argument (which does not work)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.magiscenter.com/proof-from-godel-theorem-shows-god-exists-through-super-axiom/|title=Godel's Theorem and the Existence of God|date=2017-04-26|work=Magis Center|access-date=2018-05-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are, however, many more criticisms, most focusing on the philosophically interesting question of whether these axioms ''must'' be rejected to avoid odd conclusions. The broader criticism is that even if the axioms cannot be shown to be false, that does not mean that they are true. Hilbert's famous [[Synthetic geometry#Logical synthesis|remark]] about interchangeability of the primitives' names applies to those in Gödel's ontological axioms (''"positive", "god-like", "essence"'') as well as to those in Hilbert's geometry axioms (''"point", "line", "plane"''). According to [[André Fuhrmann]] (2005) it remains to show that the dazzling notion prescribed by traditions and often believed to be essentially mysterious satisfies Gödel's axioms. This is not a mathematical, but merely a theological task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | contributionurl=https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/19453127/Homepage/downloads/GoedelExistenzNotwendigkeit.pdf | author=André Fuhrmann | chapter=Existenz und Notwendigkeit &amp;mdash; Kurt Gödels axiomatische Theologie |trans-chapter=Existence and Necessity &amp;mdash; Kurt Gödel's Axiomatic Theology | language=German | pages=349&amp;mdash;374 | editor=W. Spohn | title=Logik in der Philosophie |trans-title=Logic in Philosophy | location=Heidelberg | publisher=Synchron | year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|364–366}} It is this task which decides which religion's god has been proven to exist.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1365">'''Historical determinism''' is the stance that events are historically predetermined or currently constrained by various forces. Historical determinism can be understood in contrast to its negation, i.e. the rejection of historical determinism.

Some political philosophies (e.g. Early and Stalinist [[Marxism]]) assert a [[historical materialism]] of either predetermination or constraint, or both.

Used as a pejorative, it is normally meant to designate an overdetermination of present possibilities by historical conditions.

'''Johan Rudolph Thorbecke''' (14 January 1798 – 4 June 1872) was a Dutch statesman of [[Liberalism in the Netherlands|a liberal]] bent, one of the most important Dutch politicians of the [[19th century]]. In 1848, he virtually single-handedly drafted the revision of the [[Constitution of the Netherlands]], giving less power to the king and more to the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]], and guaranteeing more religious, personal and political freedom to the people.

==Early life and education==
[[File:Zwolle, Thorbeckehuis.jpg|thumb|left|Thorbecke's birthplace in Zwolle, nowadays known as the Thorbeckehuis]]
Thorbecke was born in [[Zwolle]]. His father Frederik Willem was a Lutheran tobacco manufacturer of German descent, while his mother Christine Regina was born in the Lower Saxon [[Osnabrück]]. Frederik Willem's business suffered badly from the [[Continental System| anti-British policies]] of the French occupiers, and his tobacco factory went bankrupt in 1803, after which he was unable to find another source of employment and would spend most of his time on the education of Johan Rudolph and his younger brother.&lt;ref name=HN&gt;{{Cite web |last=Blessing |first=Maurice |url=http://www.historischnieuwsblad.nl/nl/artikel/26817/thorbecke-romantisch-liberaal.html |title=Thorbecke: Romantisch liberaal |website=Historisch Nieuwsblad |language=Dutch |date=July 2010 |accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johan Rudolph proved to be diligent and exemplary at a young age, showing intelligence and curiosity. Because of the sacrifices of his parents, who continued to struggle with financial problems, he was able to enjoy decent education.&lt;ref name=Elsevier&gt;{{Cite web|last=Van der List |first=Gerry |url=http://www.elsevier.nl/Dossiers/achtergrond/2008/9/Thorbecke-de-belangrijkste-van-allemaal-ELSEVIER202081W/ |title=Thorbecke, de belangrijkste van allemaal |website=[[Elsevier (magazine)|Elsevier]] |language=Dutch |date=4 September 2008 |accessdate=10 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304192720/http://www.elsevier.nl/Dossiers/achtergrond/2008/9/Thorbecke-de-belangrijkste-van-allemaal-ELSEVIER202081W/ |archivedate= 4 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He enjoyed primary education in his birthplace and in [[Amsterdam]], where he lived until 1806, and attended a [[Latin school]] back in Zwolle until 1814.&lt;ref name=Parlement&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.parlement.com/id/vg09llalluyf/j_r_thorbecke |title=Dr.Mr. J.R. Thorbecke |website=Parlement &amp; Politiek |language=Dutch |accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thorbecke began studying [[classical literature]] and [[philosophy]] in [[Amsterdam]], studies he finished in [[Leiden]] defending a thesis on [[Asinius Pollio]] in 1820.&lt;ref&gt;See his PhD thesis links in External Links section below which has MDCCCXX on front matter.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after taking his doctorate, Thorbecke was granted a state scholarship for a journey through Germany. At [[University of Giessen|Giessen]] he lectured as an extraordinary professor, and at [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]], in 1824, published his treatise, ''Ueber das Wesen der Geschichte''.&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Thorbecke, Jan Rudolf|volume=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would spend four years travelling, during which he was introduced to [[historism]] and [[Romanticism]], and developed emotionally and spiritually.&lt;ref name=HN/&gt;&lt;ref name=NRC&gt;{{Cite web |last=Stevens |first=Harm |url=http://retro.nrc.nl/W2/Lab/Profiel/Grondwet/thorbecke.html |title=Een stijf Hollands heertje |website=[[NRC Handelsblad]] |language=Dutch |date=13 March 1998 |accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his return to the Netherlands in 1824, he settled in [[Amsterdam]], where he wrote his first political work of significance, ''Bedenkingen aangaande het Regt en Den Staat'' ("Objections concerning the Law and the State"). The work managed to catch attention, and Thorbecke became professor of Political Science at [[Ghent University]] the following year,&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; a position he was forced to resign from due to the [[Belgian Revolution]] in 1830. The following year, Thorbecke became professor of Diplomacy and Modern History at the [[Leiden University]],&lt;ref name=NRC/&gt; where his students would describe him as a distant, analytical mind, living a secluded life in his study.&lt;ref name=Elsevier/&gt;&lt;ref name=NRC/&gt;

Originally a loyal supporter of the conservative government of [[William I of the Netherlands|William I]], Thorbecke developed a more critical view of the government and indeed the autocratic system of government throughout the 1830s. His increasingly strong support for constitutional reform is shown in a series of essays he published from 1839 onward, starting with ''Aanteekening op de grondwet'', literally "Annotation on the constitution". The climax of this series was ''Over het hedendaags burgerschap'', literally "On contemporary citizenship", published in 1844, in which he argued that universal suffrage would eventually be unavoidable.&lt;ref name=Elsevier/&gt;&lt;ref name=NRC/&gt;

==Political career==
{{see| Constitutional Reform of 1848}}
[[Image:TK statenpassage Thorbecke.JPG|thumb|left|Statue of Thorbecke in The Hague]]
On 21 May 1844, Thorbecke was elected into the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]] for [[South Holland]].&lt;ref name=Parlement/&gt; In the House, he developed into the leader of the liberal opposition and, later that year, joined forces with eight like-minded members in a vain attempt to amend the constitution in the so-called ''Voorstel der Negenmannen'' ("Proposition of the Nine Men"). Four years later, with much of Europe convulsed by the [[Revolutions of 1848]], [[William II of the Netherlands|William II]] agreed upon the formation of a committee for revision of the constitution. Thorbecke was appointed as head of this committee on 17 March. The changes were virtually all created by Thorbecke, as the other members of the committee did little but approve of his proposals. The drafted constitution was somewhat reluctantly approved by the States General, and was proclaimed on 3 November 1848.&lt;ref name=NRC/&gt; The new constitution established civil rights and parliamentary competences, and introduced direct election of members of House of Representatives and [[ministerial responsibility]], thus limiting the power of the King and turning the country into a complete constitutional monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Turpijn |first=Jouke |url=http://www.historischnieuwsblad.nl/nl/artikel/24975/de-tweede-kamer-en-de-grondwet-van-1848.html |title=De Tweede Kamer en de grondwet van 1848 |website=Historisch Nieuwsblad |language=Dutch |date=January 2009 |accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite initial reluctance, William II appointed Thorbecke as [[formateur]] in late October 1849, and his first cabinet took office on 13 November. In this cabinet, Thorbecke served as minister of the Interior and chaired the [[Council of Ministers (Netherlands)|Council of Ministers]], thus becoming ''de facto'' [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands]]. Thorbecke's first cabinet passed several acts of particular importance, including the Electoral Act and the Province Act in 1850, and the Municipality Act in the following year.&lt;ref name=NRC/&gt;&lt;ref name=dbnl&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Molhuysen |first1=P.C. |last2=Blok |first2=P.J. |date=1918 |title=Nieuw Nederlandsch biografisch woordenboek. Deel 4 |trans-title=New Dutch biographic dictionary. Part 4 |url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/molh003nieu04_01/molh003nieu04_01_1918.php |language=Dutch |location=Leiden |publisher=A.W. Sijthoff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these successes, Thorbecke's reforms were increasingly subjected to resistance, and he was criticised for his haughtiness and his strained relationship with the King. In 1853, the [[Catholic Church]] sought to restore the episcopal hierarchy in the Netherlands. Common people, pastors and conservative notables showed resistance to this in an anti-papal movement known as the ''Aprilbeweging''. Thorbecke, who remained passive in the issue in defence of the [[separation of church and state]], was accused of catholic sympathies, and he was forced to resign.&lt;ref name=Elsevier/&gt;

Thorbecke spent nine years as leader of the opposition in the House of Representatives. He pleaded for neutrality in the [[Crimean War]] 1854, and opposed the religious nature of the Primary Education Act in 1857.&lt;ref name=dbnl/&gt;

The collapse of the conservative cabinet in 1862 brought Thorbecke back in power. On 31 January 1862, he started his second term as minister of the Interior and chairman of the Council of Minister.&lt;ref name=Parlement/&gt; Thorbecke's relationship with the King had improved because the focus of his reforms had shifted from politics to economics, and despite the increased disunity among the liberals, his cabinet lasted for four years because of the support of the Catholics. One of Thorbecke's first acts in his second term was the abolition of the governmental departments for religious services. Other notable achievements include the construction of several canals, the Secondary Education Act in May 1863, several acts on healthcare, and the municipal tax reform in 1865. The cabinet collapsed on 10 February 1866 and Thorbecke resigned after a conflict regarding criminal law in the [[Dutch East Indies]].&lt;ref name=Elsevier/&gt;&lt;ref name=dbnl/&gt;

Thorbecke returned to being leader of the opposition in the House of Representatives. In 1868, he formed the Van Bosse-Fock cabinet, but did not take part in the cabinet himself. Three years later, after this cabinet had collapsed over foreign policy, the 73-year old Thorbecke did not hesitate to start his third term.&lt;ref name=dbnl/&gt; In December 1871 fell ill, and never fully recovered. Thorbecke died at his home in [[The Hague]] on 4 June 1872, at the age of 74.&lt;ref name=NRC/&gt;

Hated by some (he was not a man of concessions), he is nowadays considered a towering figure in Dutch parliamentary history.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} There are three statues of Thorbecke (one in Amsterdam, one in The Hague and one in Zwolle) and a room in the Dutch parliament building is named after him.

Thorbecke wrote many articles on history and several newspaper articles (especially in the ''Journal de La Haye'') on topics of the day. He published a study on the [[philosophy of history]] (in German). All of his speeches in parliament have been published.

Cabrera, ''Crítica de la moral afirmativa: Una reflexión sobre nacimiento, muerte y valor de la vida'', Barcelona: Gedisa, 1996 (original Spanish edition).&lt;/ref&gt;, Julio Cabrera presents his theory about the value of human existence. Human life, for Cabrera, is "structurally negative" in that its constitutive components are inherently adverse: as prominent among them Cabrera cites loss, scarcity, [[pain]], conflicts, fragility, [[illness]], [[aging]], [[boredom]] and [[death]]. According to Cabrera they form the basic structure to human life, which he analyzes through what he calls [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], drawing freely from thinkers such as [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. Cabrera has called his work an attempt to put together Schopenhauer and Heidegger, introducing a determinant judgement of the value of Being into the analysis of [[Dasein]], and putting morality above life, against Nietzsche. 

Cabrera develops an ethical theory, negative ethics, that is informed by this phenomenological analysis. He argues that there has been an unwarranted prejudice in ethics against non-Being, a view he calls "affirmativity". Because affirmative views take Being as good, they always view things that threaten this hegemony as bad; particularly things like abstention from [[procreation]] or [[suicide]]. Cabrera criticizes affirmative ethics for asking how people should live without asking the radical question of whether people should live tout court. He argues that, because of the structural negativity of Being, there is a fundamental "moral disqualification" of human beings due to the impossibility of nonharming and nonmanipulating others. Nonharming and nonmanipulating others is called by him the "fundamental ethical articulation" ("FEA"). The FEA is violated by our structural "moral impediment", by the worldly discomforts – notably pain and discouragement – imposed on us that prevent us from acting ethically. Cabrera argues that an affirmative morality is a self-contradiction because it conceives a human existence that precludes the possibility of not-harming or not-manipulating others. Thus he believes that affirmative societies, through their politics, require the common suspension of the FEA to even function.

As a response to the negative structure of Being, Cabrera's negative ethics is acutely aware of the morally disqualifying nature of Being. Cabrera believes children are usually considered as mere aesthetic objects, are not created for their own sake but for the sake of their parents, and are thrown into a structurally negative life by the act of procreation. Procreation is, as Cabrera argues, a supreme act of manipulation, a harm  and a violation of autonomy. He argues that the consistent application of normal moral concepts – like duty, virtue or respect – present in most affirmative moralities entails [[antinatalism]]. Cabrera also believes that a human being adopting negative ethics should not only abstain from procreation, but also should have a complete willingness for an ethical death, by immediate suspension of all personal projects in benefit of a political fight&lt;ref name=autoname1&gt;J.

(Mi encuentro con Enrique Dussel)'', Essay 9 in: ''Análisis y existencia: pensamiento en travesía'', Córdoba: Ediciones del Copista, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; or an altruistic suicide, when it becomes the least immoral course of action.

Cabrera’s ''Critique'' is one of his most systematic defenses of negative ethics, but he has also explored the same ideas in other works, such as ''Projeto de Ética Negativa''&lt;ref&gt;J.

== Cinema and philosophy ==

In his first book about cinema-philosophical thought, ''Cine, 100 anos de filosofia: Una Introducción a la Filosofia A Traves del Análisis de Películas''&lt;ref&gt;J. Cabrera, ''Cine, 100 años de filosofia: Una Introducción a la Filosofia A Traves del Análisis de Películas'', Barcelona: Gedisa, 1999 (second edition in 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;, Julio Cabrera proposes the notion of "logopathy" (from Greek: "logos" – "reason" and "páthos" – "feelings"), that is, of "cognitive-affective concepts", treating them as capable of putting in question the traditional view of philosophy about concepts, which he calls apathetic and tied to purely [[intellectualism|intellectual]] concepts. Cabrera sustains that logopathic philosophy is of the order of meaning, and not of truth, and that it adds affective elements of judgment to these traditional intellectual view of concepts. 

Cabrera considers cinema one of the most fruitful means for the generation of concepts of a logopathic type, specifically denominated by him as "concept-image", as opposed to "concept-idea", the apathetic type of concept. He believes that cinema, by its powerful audiovisual means of expression, would provide a "superpotentiation" of conceptual possibilities, and therefore, of the establishment of the experience of the film, indispensable to the development of the concept-image, with the consequent increase of affective impact.

On the other hand, Cabrera believes that throughout history of European philosophy, at various moments, written philosophy – the opposite of visual philosophy – has also been logopathic, it has thought through affections, but without assuming it openly, while cinema usually has been seen only as a mere affective phenomenon, without relevant cognitive power. His notions of logopathy and concept-image seek to eliminate this dichotomy, pointing to the affectivity of the intellect and the cognitiveness of affections.
 
Cabrera gave continuity to the exposition of his cinema-philosophy thinking in books like ''De Hitchcock a Greenaway pela história da filosofia: novas reflexoes sobre cinema e filosofia''&lt;ref&gt;[http://repositorio.unb.br/bitstream/10482/15246/1/LIVRO_HitchcockGreenawaypelahistoria.pdf] J.

Cabrera, M. Tiburi, ''Diálogo/cinema'', São Paulo: Senac, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;, where in a debate through letters with Marcia Tiburi, he discusses the subject from the perspective that, long before the invention of the cinema, philosophy was already "filming" ideas through images, and also in articles ''Para una des-comprensión filosófica Del cine: el caso Inland Empire de David Lynch''&lt;ref&gt;[https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=3003168] J.

== Philosophy of language and logic ==

For Cabrera, philosophies of language are philosophies for which language does not matter in so far as it merely conveys something, but insofar as it constitutes – and implements – concepts and structures of understanding of the world. From this large sense of the term, he identifies four philosophies of language, which are: [[analytic philosophy|analytical]], [[hermeneutic]], phenomenological and meta-critical. Looking through the prism of negativity, Cabrera shows how the four above types of philosophies of language fail at a common point: their incapacity to fight against the failures of meaning. For the analytics, the point presents itself in the “meaninglessness” of expressions which is treated as a limit beyond which one should not go. However, according to Cabrera, this analytic objectivism excludes fundamental dimensions of the problem of meaning, such as time and lived experience. Phenomenology expands the analytic semantic horizon with the dimension of [[intentionality]] (of which analytic [[intensionality]] is only an inauthentic correlate, essentially objective) without the problem of meaninglessness being tamed. It remains for phenomenology, however, the temporality and historicity that hermeneutics adds to the approach of the problem, which is called "misunderstanding". Hermeneutic falls into the basic "distortions of meanings", something stronger than "meaninglessness" and "misunderstanding", a subject of meta-critical philosophies, represented by [[Karl Marx|Karl Marx’s]] and [[Sigmund Freud|Sigmund Freud’s]] philosophies of language. 

Cabrera strongly criticizes the analytic approach to language for its denial of everything that is not objective. But according to him, also the other philosophies of language show their faults, from phenomenology to hermeneutics and even meta-criticism harboring therapies redeeming only in an illusory manner: [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic healing]] or [[communism|communist utopia]]. Cabrera’s philosophy of language is a philosophy of confrontations between philosophies, which can only be made under the sign of resignation in finitude and negativism. He argues that not one of the kinds of philosophies of language that have been side-by-side in the last century and a half can, by itself, account for the complexity of the human. It is in this sense that, for Cabrera, all understanding is, ultimately, a self-sustaining illusion.

Logic for Cabrera is often linked to three fundamental principles: (1) The object that propositions deal with is indeterminate and general, (2) Logic applies to ordinary reasoning, albeit with some effort, and (3) Logic is formal rather than lexical, that is, based on the structural and non-semantic connections in language. Cabrera constructs his thought in this area by criticizing each of these three basic premises of the logical tradition. 

His intuition in this field of research is the same as in others: the intersections of traditions enriches thought and is essential to account for the human condition. Thus, logical formalization is important for thinking about existence, just as the issues of human existence are essential for understanding thinking and logic. This conception of philosophy owes the hardly unorthodox intersections that Cabrera did in his studies of logic, connecting [[Saul Kripke]] with Martin Heidegger, [[Immanuel Kant]] with [[John Langshaw Austin|John Austin]], and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] with [[Jean-Paul Sartre]].

Cabrera's work has the expectation of allying the formal instruments to the [[existentialism|existential]] contents of life. The critique to the alleged empty generality of logic goes in this direction as well as the proposal of a lexical logic of predicative connections, in an attempt to lend to lexical analysis a formal dimension, but loaded with content. The specific work on concept networks in lexical logic was developed in partnership with the physicist Olavo Leopoldino da Silva Filho, from the University of Brasilia.

His work on logic also proceeds to a revision of the history of logic. An outline of his version of the history of logic would be as follows: (1) [[Aristotle]], in [[syllogism|syllogisms]] and beyond, (2) The [[Plato]]nic conception of logic, (3) The logic of the connections of meanings in the [[Middle Ages]], (4) Modern criticisms of [[formal logic]]: [[Francis Bacon]], [[Rene Descartes]] and [[John Locke]], the [[scientific method]] and logic, [[analysis|philosophical analysis]] and [[heuristics]], the [[Port-Royal Logic]], (5) The case of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]: what the official history took and what it didn't analyze, (6) Formal logic, [[transcendental logic]]: [[Immanuel Kant]], (7) The logic in motion of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]: Hegelian criticism of denial, (8) [[Mill's Methods|the logic of the induction]] of [[John Stuart Mill]], (9) Three conceptions of logic in the passage from the nineteenth to the twentieth century: [[Gottlob Frege]], [[John Dewey]] and [[Edmund Husserl]], logic within analysis, [[pragmatism]], and phenomenology, (10) The case of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]: what the official story took and what it didn't analyze.&lt;ref name=autoname2&gt;[http://repositorio.unb.br/bitstream/10482/15264/1/LIVRO_MargensFilosofiasLinguagem.pdf] J. Cabrera, ''Margens das filosofias da linguagem: conflitos e aproximações entre analíticas, hermenêuticas, fenomenologias e metacríticas da linguagem'', Brasília: UnB, 2003 (reprinted in 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Cabrera, O.L. Da Silva Filho, ''Inferências Lexicais e Interpretação de Redes de Predicados'', Brasília: UnB, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autoname3&gt;J. Cabrera, ''Diário de um filósofo no Brasil'', Unijuí: Unijuí, 2010. (second edition in 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Cabrera also develops a negative approach to argumentation in the field of informal logic, a pessimistic parallel theory to his negative ethics. For him, an affirmative approach to argumentation is one in which philosophical problems are considered to have one solution or at least an adequate treatment amongst many others that are inadequate and wrong. In Cabrera's view, according to the affirmative approach, the multiplicity of answers given by philosophy is a mistake which must be "resolved" in some way. On the other hand, according to the negative approach, the multiplicity of answers given by philosophy is not a mistake, but its most natural development. The negative approach to argumentation is concerned with treating one's own position and perspective not as a unique truth, but as one of many within an extensive and complex [[holism|holistic]] web of approaches and perspectives, that speak and criticize mutually without discarding one another, although each of such positions may be fiercely maintained based on its perspective and assumptions, supported on defensible grounds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosopherjuliocabrera.blogspot.com/2011/05/philosophy-of-logic.html] J. Cabrera, ''Philosophy of logic'', ''The negative approach to argumentation''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://online.unisc.br/seer/index.php/signo/article/view/7990] J. Cabrera, ''Introduçao a uma abordagem negativa da argumentaçao'', Signo, Santa Cruz do Sul, volume 42, number 73, Januar/April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Latin American philosophy ==

Cabrera argues that there are epistemic injustices associated with the practice of philosophy in [[colonialism|colonized]] contexts such as in Latin America. In a lecture in [[Unisinos|Unisinos University]], Cabrera began to enunciate the problem of colonization in philosophy in a succinct and direct way:

{{blockquote|The problem is: they come here and talk about their problems in their language, we go there and talk about their problems in their language''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://filosofojuliocabrera.blogspot.com/2011/08/filosofia-no-brasil.html] J. Cabrera, ''A questão da filosofia no Brasil no contexto da reflexão sobre civilização e barbárie no pensamento argentino'', lecture given at Unisinos University, 14 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A central idea he came to defend is that the current status of philosophy in many Latin American countries is a product of the way philosophy is taught, researched, and written by local institutions that are subordinate to the international scene. Professional philosophy in these countries have been developed around commenting European (and, to a lesser extent, North American) philosophers, and this emphasis has developed as a corollary of the idea that philosophy is done only with reference to European philosophers and no Latin American is encouraged to challenge this hegemony. Alongside this inhibition of Latin American philosophy is the idea that what is European is universal while what is Latin American is merely local or national. He makes a diagnosis in the form of "acervo T" ("T collection"), theses on the hegemony of [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] philosophy; this collection of theses is understood by Cabrera as being tacitly adopted by most of the Latin American philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://repositorio.unb.br/bitstream/10482/18028/1/ARTIGO_EuropeuNaoSignificaUniversal.pdf] J. Cabrera, ''Europeu não significa universal, brasileiro não significa nacional'', Brasileira de Humanidades, Nabuco, number 2, November 2014/January/February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In opposition to this colonial order, Cabrera proposes and recommends several practices concerning the teaching and practice of philosophy, among them: (1) A greater attention to Latin American sources so that the history of philosophy on the continent does not continue to be ignored by local philosophers and that the work of these philosophers be as much discussed as that of European sources, (2) A stimulus to philosophy that is not from Latin America nor about Latin America, but from Latin America where the local starting point is made explicit, (3) The practice of appropriation in which philosophers from other contexts are placed in discussions of interest to Latin America. This practice can be found in important philosophical works in Latin America such as that of [[Enrique Dussel]] with which Cabrera maintained published debates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dianoia.filosoficas.unam.mx/files/1913/6132/3542/DIA52_Cabrera.pdf] J. Cabrera, ''Dussel y el suicídio'', Dianoia, XLIX, 52, 2004, pp. 111–124.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autoname1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Cabrera, ''Análisis y existencia: pensamiento en travesía'', Córdoba: Ediciones del Copista, 2010, Essay 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cabrera has defended the crossing of boundaries between traditions and has on many occasions shown the potential for fertilization stemming from the juxtaposition, friction and debate between philosophies originating from analytical and [[continental philosophy|continental]] traditions.&lt;ref name="autoname2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Cabrera, ''Análisis y existencia: pensamiento en travesía'', Córdoba: Ediciones del Copista, 2010, Essays 1–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, he extended this metaphilosophical approach in the direction of making it an element of the struggle against what he began to clearly see as the colonized state of philosophy in Latin America.

In his book ''Diário de um filósofo no Brasil'', Cabrera documents the problems of self-reliant inventive philosophy in Brazil; the book describes the environment of suppression of philosophical intuition in its many mechanisms attending to what is specific in the Brazilian colonized context.&lt;ref name="autoname3" /&gt; The book portraits what it means to philosophize from somewhere and tries to present alternatives to the philosophical commentary that can flourish even in a hostile environment. 

For Cabrera, it is important to understand from where philosophy in Latin America is made: it is made from invaded, looted, dominated countries that have been placed in intellectual subservience. He claims that this makes the philosophy produced there different from all European philosophy – and it is important to stress that no philosophy is born universal. Cabrera notes that philosophy in Brazil, especially made in departments in the academy, is particularly blind to the sources of Latin American thought, both from the classics ([[Bartolomé de Las Casas]], [[Antônio Vieira]], [[Flora Tristan]], [[Juan Bautista Alberdi]], [[José Martí]] and [[José Enrique Rodó]]) and contemporary ([[José Carlos Mariátegui]], [[Edmundo O'Gorman]], [[Leopoldo Zea]], [[Miguel León Portilla]], [[Roberto Fernández Retamar]] and Santiago Castro-Gómez), known only in isolated expert communities. His proposition is a course in the history of thought that begins with pre-Columbian [[Amerindian]] thought and which does not pass through Europeans (nor Greeks) until the nineteenth century. The idea is to read nineteenth-century European philosophers who challenged intellectualist and Christian traditions, such as Arthur Schopenhauer, [[Søren Kierkegaard]] and Friedrich Nietzsche (and their precursors [[Michel de Montaigne]], [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]), as influenced virtually by Amerindian ways of living and thinking.&lt;ref&gt;J.

{{Immanuel Kant}}

'''Kantianism''' is the philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]], a [[Germans|German]] philosopher born in [[Königsberg]], [[Prussia]] (now [[Kaliningrad]], [[Russia]]). The term "Kantianism" or "Kantian" is sometimes also used to describe contemporary positions in [[philosophy of mind]], [[epistemology]], and [[ethics]].

== Ethics ==
{{Main|Kantian ethics}}
[[Kantian ethics]] are [[deontological]], revolving entirely around duty rather than emotions or end goals. All actions are performed in accordance with some underlying [[Maxim (philosophy)|maxim]] or principle, which are vastly different from each other; it is according to this that the moral worth of any action is judged. Kant's ethics are founded on his view of rationality as the ultimate good and his belief that all people are fundamentally rational beings. This led to the most important part of Kant's ethics, the formulation of the [[categorical imperative]], which is the criterion for whether a maxim is good or bad.

Simply put, this criterion amounts to a [[thought experiment]]: to attempt to universalize the maxim (by imagining a world where all people necessarily acted in this way in the relevant circumstances) and then see if the maxim and its associated action would still be conceivable in such a world. For instance, holding the maxim ''kill anyone who annoys you'' and applying it universally would result in a world which would soon be devoid of people and without anyone left to kill. Thus holding this maxim is irrational as it ends up being impossible to hold it.

Universalizing a maxim (statement) leads to it being valid, or to one of two contradictions — a contradiction in conception (where the maxim, when universalized, is no longer a viable means to the end) or a contradiction in will (where the will of a person contradicts what the universalization of the maxim implies). The first type leads to      a "perfect duty", and the second leads to an "imperfect duty."

Kant's ethics focus then only on the maxim that underlies actions and judges these to be good or bad solely on how they conform to reason. Kant showed that many of our common sense views of what is good or bad conform to his system but denied that any action performed for reasons other than rational actions can be good (saving someone who is drowning simply out of a great pity for them is not a morally good act). Kant also denied that the consequences of an act in any way contribute to the moral worth of that act, his reasoning being (highly simplified for brevity) that the physical world is outside our full control and thus we cannot be held accountable for the events that occur in it.

The Formulations of the [[Categorical Imperative]]:

# Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|authorlink=Immanuel Kant |translator=James W. Ellington |title=Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals |edition=3rd |publisher=Hackett|year=1993|page=30|isbn=0-87220-166-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|authorlink=Immanuel Kant |translator=James W.

#Therefore, every rational being must so act as if he were through his maxim always a legislating member in the universal kingdom of ends.&lt;ref name="Ellington"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|authorlink=Immanuel Kant |translator=James W. Ellington |title=Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals |edition=3rd |publisher=Hackett|year=1993|page=43|isbn=0-87220-166-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political philosophy==
In [[political philosophy]], Kant has had wide and increasing influence with major political philosophers of the late twentieth century. For example,  [[John Rawls]] {{citation needed|date=November 2015}} drew heavily on his inspiration in setting out the basis for a [[Liberalism|liberal]] view of political institutions.{{clarify | date = November 2015 | reason = | What inspiration? What is Rawls's view? What is Kant's view? How are the two views reconciled in Liberal thought? }} The nature of Rawls' use of Kant has engendered serious controversy  {{ clarify | date = November 2015 | reason = | What nature? What controversy? |}} but has demonstrated the vitality of Kantian considerations across a wider range of questions than was once thought plausible.

The '''liberal paradox''', also '''Sen paradox''' or '''Sen's paradox''', is a logical [[paradox]] discovered by [[Amartya Sen]] which purports to show that no social system can simultaneously
# be committed to a minimal sense of freedom,
# always result in a type of economic efficiency known as [[Pareto efficiency]], and
# be capable of functioning in any society whatsoever.&lt;ref name="SenJPE"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Amartya|last=Sen|title=The Impossibility of a Paretian Liberal|journal=Journal of Political Economy|year=1970|volume=78|pages=152–157|jstor=1829633|doi=10.1086/259614}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SenCCSW"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sen|first=Amartya|title=Collective Choice and Social Welfare|origyear=1970|year=1984|publisher=New Holland|isbn=978-0444851277}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SenRF"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sen|first=Amartya|title=Rationality and Freedom|year=2004|publisher= Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0674013513}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This paradox is contentious because it appears to contradict the [[classical liberal]] claim that markets are both [[Pareto efficient]] and respect [[Civil liberties|individual freedoms]].

The paradox is similar in many respects to [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]] and uses similar mathematical techniques.

==Pareto efficiency==
{{main|Pareto efficiency}}

===Definition===

A particular distribution of goods or outcome of any social process is regarded as ''Pareto efficient'' if there is no way to improve one or more people's situations without harming another. Put another way, an outcome is '''not''' Pareto efficient if there is a way to improve at least one person's situation without harming anyone else.

For example, suppose a mother has ten dollars which she intends to give to her two children Carlos and Shannon. Suppose the children each want only money, and they do not get jealous of one another. The following distributions are Pareto efficient:

{| class="wikitable"
! Carlos 
! Shannon
|-
| $5 
| $5
|-
| $10 
| $0
|-
| $2 
| $8
|}

But a distribution that gives each of them $2 and where the mother wastes the remaining $6 is not Pareto efficient, because she could have given the wasted money to either child and made that child better off without harming the other.

In this example, it was presumed that a child was made better or worse off by gaining or losing money, respectively, and that neither child gained or lost by evaluating her share in comparison to the other.  To be more precise, we must evaluate all possible [[utility|preferences]] that the child might have and consider a situation as Pareto efficient if there is no other social state that at least one person favors (or prefers) and no one disfavors.

===Use in economics===

Pareto efficiency is often used in economics as a minimal sense of [[economic efficiency]].  If a mechanism does not result in Pareto efficient outcomes, it is regarded as inefficient since there was another outcome which could have made some people better off without harming anyone else.

The view that [[Market (economics)|markets]] produce Pareto efficient outcomes is regarded as an important and central justification for [[capitalism]].  This result was established (with certain assumptions) in an area of study known as [[general equilibrium theory]], and is known as [[Fundamental theorems of welfare economics|the first fundamental theorem of welfare economics]]. As a result, these results often feature prominently in [[libertarian]] justifications of unregulated markets.

==Two examples==

=== Sen's original example ===

Sen's original example&lt;ref name="SenJPE" /&gt; used a simple society with only two people and only one social issue to consider.  The two members of society are named "Lewd" and "Prude".  In this society there is a copy of a ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' and it must be given either to Lewd to read, to Prude to read, or disposed of unread.  Suppose that Lewd enjoys this sort of reading and would prefer to read it himself rather than have it disposed of.  However, he would get even more enjoyment out of Prude being forced to read it.

Prude thinks that the book is indecent and that it should be disposed of unread.  However, if someone must read it Prude would prefer that he, himself read it rather than Lewd since Prude thinks it would be even worse for someone to read and enjoy the book rather than read it in disgust.

Given these preferences of the two individuals in the society, a social planner must decide what to do.  Should the planner force Lewd to read the book, force Prude to read the book, or let it go unread?  More particularly, the social planner must rank all three possible outcomes in terms of their social desirability.  The social planner decides that she should be committed to individual rights, each individual should get to choose whether he, himself will read the book. Lewd should get to decide whether the outcome "Lewd reads" will be ranked higher than "No one reads", and similarly Prude should get to decide whether the outcome "Prude reads" will be ranked higher than "No one reads".

Following this strategy, the social planner declares that the outcome "Lewd reads" will be ranked higher than "No one reads" (because of Lewd's preferences) and that "No one reads" will be ranked higher than "Prude reads" (because of Prude's preferences).  Consistency then requires that "Lewd reads" be ranked higher than "Prude reads", and so the social planner gives the book to Lewd to read.

Notice that this outcome is regarded as worse than "Prude reads" by both Prude ''and'' Lewd, and the chosen outcome is therefore [[Pareto efficiency|Pareto inferior]] to another available outcome—the one where Prude is forced to read the book.

=== Gibbard's example ===

Another example was provided by philosopher [[Allan Gibbard]].&lt;ref name="Gibbard"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gibbard|first=Allan|title=A Pareto Consistent Libertarian Claim|journal=Journal of Economic Theory|year=1974|volume=7|pages=388–410 |doi=10.1016/0022-0531(74)90111-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suppose there are two individuals Alice and Bob who live next door to each other.  Alice loves the color blue and hates red.  Bob loves the color green and hates yellow.  If each were free to choose the color of their house independently of the other, they would choose their favorite colors.  But Alice hates Bob with a passion, and she would gladly endure a red house if it meant that Bob would have to endure his house being yellow.  Bob similarly hates Alice, and would gladly endure a yellow house if that meant that Alice would live in a red house.

If each individual is free to choose their own house color, independently of the other, Alice would choose a blue house and Bob would choose a green one.  But, this outcome is not Pareto efficient, because both Alice and Bob would prefer the outcome where Alice's house is red and Bob's is yellow.  As a result, giving each individual the freedom to choose their own house color has led to an inefficient outcome—one that is inferior to another outcome where neither is free to choose their own color.

Mathematically, we can represent Alice's preferences with this symbol: &lt;math&gt;\succ_A&lt;/math&gt; and Bob's preferences with this one: &lt;math&gt;\succ_B&lt;/math&gt;.  We can represent each outcome as a pair: (''Color of Alice's house'', ''Color of Bob's house'').  As stated Alice's preferences are:

:(Blue, Yellow) &lt;math&gt;\succ_A&lt;/math&gt; (Red, Yellow) &lt;math&gt;\succ_A&lt;/math&gt; (Blue, Green) &lt;math&gt;\succ_A&lt;/math&gt; (Red, Green)

And Bob's are:

:(Red, Green) &lt;math&gt;\succ_B&lt;/math&gt; (Red, Yellow) &lt;math&gt;\succ_B&lt;/math&gt; (Blue, Green) &lt;math&gt;\succ_B&lt;/math&gt; (Blue, Yellow)

If we allow free and independent choices of both parties we end up with the outcome (Blue, Green) which is dispreferred by both parties to the outcome (Red, Yellow) and is therefore not Pareto efficient.

==The theorem==
Suppose there is a society ''N'' consisting of two or more individuals and a set ''X'' of two or more social outcomes. (For example, in the Alice and Bob case, ''N'' consisted of Alice and Bob, and ''X'' consisted of the four color options ⟨Blue, Yellow⟩, ⟨Blue, Green⟩, ⟨Red, Yellow⟩, and ⟨Red, Green⟩.)

Suppose each individual in the society has a [[Total relation|total]] and [[transitive relation|transitive]] preference relation on the set of social outcomes ''X''. For notation, the preference relation of an individual ''i''∊''N'' is denoted by ≼&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. Each preference relation belongs to the set ''Rel(X)'' of all total and transitive relations on ''X''.

A social choice function is a map which can take any configuration of preference relations of ''N'' as input and produce a subset of ("chosen") social outcomes as output. Formally, a social choice function is a map

&lt;math&gt;F : {Rel}(X)^N \rightarrow \mathcal{P}(X)&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!--all possible combinations of preference relations for members of ''N''!--&gt;

from the set of functions between ''N''→''Rel(X)'', to the power set of ''X''. (Intuitively, the social choice function represents a societal principle for choosing one or more social outcomes based on individuals' preferences. By representing the social choice process as a ''function'' on ''Rel(X)''&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;, we are tacitly assuming that the social choice function is defined for any possible configuration of preference relations; this is sometimes called the Universal Domain assumption.)


The liberal paradox states that every social choice function satisfies ''at most one'' of the following properties, never both:

# '''Pareto optimality''': whenever all individuals of a society strictly prefer an outcome ''x'' over an outcome ''y'', the choice function doesn't pick ''y''. 
#* Formally, a social choice function ''F'' is Pareto optimal if whenever ''p''∊''Rel(X)''&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt; is a configuration of preference relations and there are two outcomes ''x'' and ''y'' such that  ''x''⪲&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;''y'' for every individual ''i''∊''N'', then ''y''∉ ''F(p)''.
# '''Minimal liberalism''': More than one individual in the society is '''decisive''' on a pair of social outcomes. (An individual is decisive on a pair of social outcomes ''x'' and ''y'' if, whenever he prefers ''x'' over ''y'', the social choice function prefers ''x'' over ''y'' regardless of what other members of the society prefer. And similarly whenever he prefers ''y'' over ''x'', the social choice function prefers ''y'' over ''x''.)
#* Formally, a social choice function ''F'' respects minimal liberalism if there is more than one individual ''i''∊''N'' for which there exists a pair of outcomes ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; on which he is decisive—that is, for every configuration of preference relations  ''p''∊''Rel(X)''&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;∊ ''F(p)'' only when ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;≼&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; (and similarly, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;∊ ''F(p)'' only when ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;≼&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;).
#* As an example of decisiveness: in the Lewd/Prude case, Lewd was decisive on the pair of outcomes ⟨"Lewd reads", "No one reads"⟩ and Prude was decisive on the pair of outcomes ⟨"Prude reads", "No one reads"⟩.

In other words, the liberal paradox states that for every social choice function ''F'', there is a configuration of preference relations ''p''∊''Rel(X)''&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt; for which ''F'' violates either Pareto optimality or Minimal liberalism (or both). In the examples of Sen and Gibbard noted above, the social choice function satisfies minimal liberalism at the expense of Pareto optimality.

==Ways out of the paradox==

Because the paradox relies on very few conditions, there are a limited number of ways to escape the paradox.  Essentially one must either reject the ''universal domain'' assumption, the ''Pareto principle'', or the ''minimal liberalism principle.''  Sen himself suggested two ways out, one a rejection of universal domain another a rejection of the Pareto principle.

=== Universal domain ===

Julian Blau proves that Sen's paradox can only arise when individuals have "nosy" preferences—that is when their preference depends not only on their own action but also on others' actions.&lt;ref name="Blau"&gt;{{cite book|last=Blau|first=Julian|title=Liberal Values and Independence|journal=The Review of Economic Studies|year=1975|volume=42|number=3|pages=395–401 |doi=10.2307/2296852 |jstor=2296852}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the example of Alice and Bob above, Alice has a preference over how Bob paints his house, and Bob has a preference over Alice's house color as well.

Most arguments which demonstrate market efficiency assume that individuals care about only their own consumption and not others' consumption and therefore do not consider the situations that give rise to Sen's paradox.  In fact, this shows a strong relationship between Sen's paradox and the well known result that [[Market failure|markets fail]] to produce Pareto outcomes in the presence of [[externalities]].&lt;ref name= "Laffont"&gt;[[Jean-Jacques Laffont|Laffont, J. J.]] (2008). "externalities," ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2nd Ed. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_E000200&amp;q=externality&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=9 Abstract.]&lt;/ref&gt; Externalities arise when the choices of one party affect another.  Classic examples of externalities include [[pollution]] or [[over fishing]]. Because of their nosy preferences, Alice's choice imposes a negative externality on Bob and vice versa.

To prevent the paradox, Sen suggests that "The ultimate guarantee for individual liberty may rest not on rules for social choice but on developing individual values that respect each other's personal choices."&lt;ref name="SenJPE" /&gt; Doing so would amount to limiting certain types of nosy preferences, or alternatively restricting the application of the Pareto principle only to those situations where individuals fail to have nosy preferences.

Note that if we consider the case of cardinal preferences—for instance, if Alice and Bob both had to state, within certain bounds, how much happiness they would get for each color of each house separately, and the situation which produced the most happiness were chosen—a minimally-liberal solution does not require that they have no nosiness at all, but just that the sum of all "nosy" preferences about one house's color are below some threshold, while the "non-nosy" preferences are all above that threshold. Since there are generally some questions for which this will be true—Sen's classic example is an individual's choice of whether to sleep on their back or their side—the goal of combining minimal liberalism with Pareto efficiency, while impossible to guarantee in all theoretical cases, may not in practice be impossible to obtain.

=== Pareto ===

Alternatively, one could remain committed to the universality of the rules for social choice and to individual rights and instead reject the universal application of the Pareto principle.  Sen also hints that this should be how one escapes the paradox: 
{{quote|What is the moral?  It is that in a very basic sense liberal values conflict with the Pareto principle. If someone takes the Pareto principle seriously, as economists seem to do, then he has to face problems of consistency in cherishing liberal values, even very mild ones.  Or, to look at it in another way, if someone does have certain liberal values, then he may have to eschew his adherence to Pareto optimality. While the Pareto criterion has been thought to be an expression of individual liberty, it appears that in choices involving more than two alternatives it can have consequences that are, in fact, deeply illiberal.&lt;ref name="SenJPE" /&gt;}}

=== Minimal liberalism ===

Most commentators on Sen's paradox have argued that Sen's minimal liberalism condition does not adequately capture the notion of individual rights.&lt;ref name="Gibbard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nozick"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nozick|first=Robert|year=1974|title=Anarchy, State, and Utopia|publisher=Basic books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gardenfors"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gärdenfors|first=Peter|year=1981|title=Rights, games and social choice|journal=Nous|volume=15|number=3|pages=341–356 |jstor=2215437|doi=10.2307/2215437 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sugden"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sugden|first=Robert|year=1985|title=Why be consistent? A critical analysis of consistency requirements in choice theory|journal=Economica|volume=52|number=206|pages=167–183 |jstor=2554418|doi=10.2307/2554418 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially what is excluded from Sen's characterization of individual rights is the ability to voluntarily form contracts that lay down one's claim to a right.

For example, in the example of Lewd and Prude, although each has a right to refuse to read the book, Prude would voluntarily sign a contract with Lewd promising to read the book on condition that Lewd refrain from doing so.  In such a circumstance there was no violation of Prude's or Lewd's rights because each entered the contract willingly.  Similarly, Alice and Bob might sign a contract to each paint their houses their dispreferred color on condition that the other does the same.

In this vein, Gibbard provides a weaker version of the minimal liberalism claim which he argues is consistent with the possibility of contracts and which is also consistent with the Pareto principle given any possible preferences of the individuals.&lt;ref name="Gibbard" /&gt;

=== Dynamism ===

Alternatively, instead of both Lewd and Prude deciding what to do at the same time, they should do it one after the other. If Prude decides not to read, then Lewd will decide to read, same outcome. However, if Prude decides to read, Lewd won't. "Prude reads" is preferred by Prude (and also Lewd) than "Lewd reads", so he will decide to read (with no obligation, voluntarily) to get this Pareto Efficient outcome. Marc Masat hints that this should be another way out of the paradox: 

{{quote|If there's, at least, one player without dominant strategy, the game will be played sequentially where players with dominant strategy and need to change it (if they are in the Pareto optimal they don't have to) will be the firsts to choose, allowing to reach the Pareto Efficiency without dictatorship nor restricted domain and also avoiding contract's costs such as time, money or other people. If all players present a dominant strategy, contracts may be used.&lt;ref name="Masat"&gt;{{cite paper|last=Masat|first=Marc|year=2014|title=Did you save room for dessert?

'''Ordinary language philosophy''' is a [[philosophical methodology]] that sees traditional philosophical problems as rooted in misunderstandings philosophers develop by [[stipulative definition|distorting or forgetting what words actually mean]] in [[natural language|everyday use]]. "Such 'philosophical' uses of language, on this view, create the very philosophical problems they are employed to solve."&lt;ref name=ParkerRyan/&gt; Ordinary language philosophy is a branch of [[linguistic philosophy]] closely related to [[logical positivism]].&lt;ref name=ParkerRyan/&gt;

This approach typically involves eschewing philosophical "theories" in favor of close attention to the details of the use of everyday "ordinary" language. It is sometimes associated with the later work of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and a number of mid-20th century philosophers that can be split into two main groups, neither of which could be described as an organized "school".&lt;ref name=Chappell/&gt; In its earlier stages contemporaries of Wittgenstein at Cambridge University such as [[Norman Malcolm]], [[Alice Ambrose]], [[Friedrich Waismann]], [[Oets Kolk Bouwsma]] and [[Morris Lazerowitz]] started to develop ideas recognisable as ordinary language philosophy. These ideas were further elaborated from 1945 onwards through the work of some Oxford University philosophers led initially by [[Gilbert Ryle]], then followed by [[J. L. Austin]]. This Oxford group also included [[H. L. A. Hart]], [[Geoffrey Warnock]], [[J. O. Urmson]] and [[P. F. Strawson|Peter Strawson]]. The close association between ordinary language philosophy and these later thinkers has led to it sometimes being referred to as "Oxford philosophy". More recent philosophers with at least some commitment to the method of ordinary language philosophy include [[Stanley Cavell]], [[John Searle]] and [[Oswald Hanfling]].

== Central ideas ==
The later Wittgenstein held that the meanings of words reside in their ordinary uses and that this is why philosophers trip over words taken in [[abstraction]]. From this came the idea that philosophy had gotten into trouble by trying to use words outside of the context of their use in ordinary language. For example, "understanding" is what you mean when you say "I understand". "Knowledge" is what you mean when you say "I know that". The point is, you ''already know'' what "understanding" or "knowledge" are, at least implicitly. Philosophers are ill-advised to construct new definitions for these terms, because this is necessarily a ''re''definition, and the argument may unravel into self-referential nonsense. Rather, philosophers must explore the definitions that these terms already have, without forcing a convenient redefinition onto them. 

The controversy really begins when ordinary language philosophers apply the same leveling tendency to questions such as ''What is Truth?'' or ''What is Consciousness?'' Philosophers in this school would insist that we cannot assume that (for example) 'Truth' 'is' a 'thing' (in the same sense that tables and chairs are 'things'), which the word 'truth' represents. Instead, we must look at the differing ways in which the words 'truth' and 'conscious' actually function in ordinary language. We may well discover, after investigation, that there is no single entity to which the word 'truth' corresponds, something Wittgenstein attempts to get across via his concept of a 'family resemblance' (cf. ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]''). Therefore, ordinary language philosophers tend to be anti-[[essentialism|essentialist]].

Anti-essentialism and the linguistic philosophy associated with it are often important to contemporary accounts of [[feminism]], [[Marxism]], and other social philosophies that are critical of the injustice of the [[status quo]]. The essentialist 'Truth' as 'thing' is argued to be closely related to projects of domination, where the denial of alternate truths is understood to be a denial of alternate forms of living. Similar arguments sometimes involve ordinary language philosophy with other anti-essentialist movements like [[post-structuralism]]. However, strictly speaking, this is not a position derived from Wittgenstein, as it still involves 'misuse' (ungrammatical use) of the term "truth" in reference to "alternate truths".

== History ==
{{Wittgenstein|Movements}}
Early analytic philosophy had a less positive view of ordinary language. [[Bertrand Russell]] tended to dismiss language as being of little philosophical significance, and ordinary language as just being too confused to help solve metaphysical and epistemological problems.  [[Frege]], the [[Vienna Circle]] (especially [[Rudolf Carnap]]), the young Wittgenstein, and [[W.V. Quine]], all attempted to improve upon it, in particular using the resources of modern [[logic]]. Wittgenstein's view in the ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'' more or less agreed with Russell's that language ought to be reformulated so as to be unambiguous, so as to accurately represent the world, so that we could better deal with the questions of philosophy.

By contrast, Wittgenstein would later describe his task as bringing "words back from their metaphysical to their everyday use".&lt;ref name=Wittgenstein/&gt; The sea-change brought on by his unpublished work in the 1930s centered largely on the idea that there is nothing ''wrong'' with ordinary language as it stands, and that many traditional philosophical problems were only illusions brought on by misunderstandings about language and related subjects. The former idea led to rejecting the approaches of earlier analytic philosophy – arguably, of any earlier philosophy – and the latter led to replacing them with the careful attention to language in its normal use, in order to "dissolve" the appearance of philosophical problems, rather than attempt to solve them. At its inception, ordinary language philosophy (also called linguistic philosophy) had been taken as either an extension of or as an alternative to analytic philosophy. Now that the term "[[analytic philosophy]]" has a more standardized meaning, ordinary language philosophy is viewed as a stage of the analytic tradition that followed logical positivism and that preceded the yet-to-be-named stage analytic philosophy continues in today. According to Preston, analytic philosophy is now in a fifth, eclectic or pluralistic, phase he calls 'post-linguistic analytic philosophy' that tends to 'emphasize precision and thoroughness about a narrow topic, and to deemphasize the imprecise or cavalier discussion of broad topics'.&lt;ref name=Preston/&gt;

Ordinary language analysis largely flourished and developed at [[Oxford]] in the 1940s, under Austin and [[Gilbert Ryle]], and was quite widespread for a time before declining rapidly in popularity in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It is now not uncommon to hear that Ordinary Language philosophy is no longer an active force.&lt;ref name=Forguson/&gt; Wittgenstein is perhaps the only one among the major figures of linguistic philosophy to retain anything like the reputation he had at that time. On the other hand, the attention to language remains one of the most important techniques in contemporary analytic thought, and many of the effects of ordinary language philosophy can still be felt across many academic disciplines.

== Criticism ==

One of the most ardent critics of ordinary language philosophy was a student at Oxford, [[Ernest Gellner]] who said:&lt;ref name=Gellner/&gt;

{{quote|"[A]t that time the orthodoxy best described as linguistic philosophy, inspired by Wittgenstein, was crystallizing and seemed to me totally and utterly misguided. Wittgenstein's basic idea was that there is no general solution to issues other than the custom of the community. Communities are ultimate. He didn't put it this way, but that was what it amounted to. And this doesn't make sense in a world in which communities are not stable and are not clearly isolated from each other. Nevertheless, Wittgenstein managed to sell this idea, and it was enthusiastically adopted as an unquestionable revelation. It is very hard nowadays for people to understand what the atmosphere was like then. This was ''the'' Revelation. It wasn't doubted. But it was quite obvious to me it was wrong. It was obvious to me the moment I came across it, although initially, if your entire environment, and all the bright people in it, hold something to be true, you assume ''you'' must be wrong, not understanding it properly, and they must be right. And so I explored it further and finally came to the conclusion that I did understand it right, and it ''was'' rubbish, which indeed it is."|Ernest Gellner|Interview with John Davis, 1991}}

'''Philosophy of Architecture''' is a branch of [[philosophy of art]], dealing with aesthetic value of [[architecture]], its [[semantics]] and relations with development of [[culture]].

==History ==

=== Early history ===

[[Plato]], whose influence on architecture is widely documented (e.g., 'idealism', 'neo-Platonic' architecture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hendrix | first=John Shannon | authorlink=John Shannon Hendrix | date=1999 | title=Neoplatonic Philosophy and Roman Baroque Architecture | journal=The European Studies Journal | publisher=University of Northern Iowa | volume=16 | issue=1 |pages=31–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;), may be counted as part of a classical geometric model of cosmology, the popularity of which could be attributed to earlier thinkers such as [[Pythagoras]]. In early history, philosophers distinguished architecture ('technion') from building ('demiorgos'), attributing the former to mental traits, and the latter to the divine or natural. It was only with Socratic irony that the name craftsman could become representative of a religious deity. The presence of some degree of formalism ala Platonism continues to be an important trait in distinguishing one architectural style from another, and thus in distinguishing the philosophy of a style.

Due to the nature of critique, the philosophy of architecture is an outgrowth of the [[philosophy of art]], which began to be expressed in books on architecture and history of architecture during the latter half of the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="Harries p. 29"&gt;{{ cite journal | author=Harries K. | title= Philosophy and the Task of Architecture | journal=Journal of Architectural Education | volume=40 | issue=2 | date=Winter 1987 | pages=29 | doi=10.2307/1424928}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to that, largely because of its reliance on technology and engineering, architecture was seen as incompatible, or beneath, the proper subject areas of classical aesthetics as delimited by, notably, [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten]], with their ideal of "pure art."&lt;ref name="Harries p. 29" /&gt;

=== Modern period ===

[[File:Panopticon.jpg|thumb | Panopticon. Drawing by [[Jeremy Bentham]] in 1791.]]
As it was noted by [[Michel Foucault]], the architecture is able to set the life of society, and therefore it is particularly important for understanding of the person's values and culture. In "[[Discipline and Punish]]" Foucault analized contemporary culture through architecture project of principally new prison [[Panopticon]]. The point of this project by [[Jeremy Bentham]] was to create a special transparent environment for prisoners, where everyone would be under constant surveillance. Although the project was not realized, Bentham's thought deeply influenced ideology of prisons, changing social practices of punishment. Simultaneously with its main conclusions Foucault reached other goal - his instrumental use of architecture in cultural studies showed the potential of this philosophical theme.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

However, philosophy of architecture as a full-fledged part of the Philosophy of Art, would not have been possible without the [[Avant-garde]]`s shift of the aesthetic paradigm. Art, set in the conditions of [[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction|mechanical reproduction of the image]], was forced to look for new ways. Around the same time architectural styles of [[Constructivist architecture|Constructivism]] and [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalism]] find way to justify new, totally engineering aesthetics. Side of the architecture, which had been considered a shame (as a sign of its connection with the pragmatic needs of man and society), became a major advantage, central part of new system of aesthetic values. [[Cubism]] and [[Futurism]] set aesthetic, full of mechanized, slaughtered, brutal forms, what was very close to the same engineering ideal. All this created more than favorable environment to change status of architecture in our system of art, as well as our understanding of art by itself.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

=== Postmodernism ===
[[File:Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village crop.jpg| thumb | 450pks | Photography "[[Stuyvesant Town - Peter Cooper Village]]," according to Martin R.&lt;ref name="Martin R."&gt;Martin R. "Architecture's Image Problem. Have We Ever Been Postmodern." ''Grey Room,'' No. 22 (Winter, 2006), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; it is an architectural work, which may serve as one of the first manifestations of postmodernism]]
Architecture assumed much more significant role after establishing of the phenomenon of [[Postmodernism]]. According to R. Martin "it remains surprising how many influential accounts of cultural postmodernism make reference to architecture."&lt;ref name="Martin R." /&gt;
Some scholars go so far as to claim that the entire post-modernism comes from the practice of architecture, and the rejection of "[[Art Nouveau|style of Modern]]" as an architectural style, and by so architects terminologically formulated postmodernism. Thus, F. Jameson writes that "it is in the realm of architecture, however, that modifications in aesthetic production are most dramatically visible, and that their theoretical problems have been most centrally raised and articulated (...) it was indeed from architectural debates that my own conception of post-modernism (...) initially began to emerge."&lt;ref&gt;Jameson F. Postmodernism, or, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism. 2003. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; As it was noted by researchers, "Barthes and Eco, taking their cue from Russian Formalism, see norm breaking as the mark of the aesthetic (sc., the aesthetic code). Art is characteristically inventive in its capacity to have signs do duty as signifier of further meanings in a potentially endless play upon convention as well as within it or on its margin."&lt;ref name="Donougho M 1987 p. 65"&gt;Donougho M. The Language of Architecture // Journal of Aesthetic Education, Vol. 21, No. 3 (Autumn, 1987), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; So important to postmodern writers like [[Barthes, Roland|R. Bart]] and [[Eco, Umberto|U. Eco]], saw architecture as a source of revolutionary innovations in art.&lt;ref name="Donougho M 1987 p. 65"/&gt;
[[File:The Luxor From Airport.jpg| thumb | 450pks | Photo of casino "Luxor", an example of architecture of "Las Vegas", which formed the basis for post-modernist manifesto of [[Robert Venturi]] and has played a key role in the development of post-modernism according to F. Jameson]]F. Jameson believes that there is a special relationship between postmodernism and American architecture, in which the birth of a national architecture coincided, in his opinion, with the emergence of the terminology or even the reality of postmodernism.&lt;ref&gt;Jameson F. Postmodernism, or, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism. 2003. p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all researchers agree with his post-modern "architectural origins," so [[Andreas Huyssen]], suggests that the conceptual frame of postmodernism has been defined within certain movements of literature. However, this researcher also notes the special role of architecture in the development of post-modernism. Martin describes, that "Huyssen credits architecture with helping to disseminate the term postmodernism, originally from literature, into the expanded aesthetic sphere during the 1970s."&lt;ref name="Martin R." /&gt; [[Jean-François Lyotard|Lyotard]] contends that postmodern architects have nothing in common with true Postmodernism &lt;ref name="Martin R." /&gt; and, as Lyotard states it in his article, ''Answering the Question: What Is Postmodernism?'': "under the name of postmodernism, architects are getting rid of the Bauhaus project, throwing out the baby of experimentation with the bathwater of functionalism."&lt;ref&gt;Lyotard J.-F. Answering the Question: What Is Postmodernism? // Lyotard J.-F. The Posmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge. 1984. p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

A special figure for the philosophy of architecture can be considered the architect [[Robert Venturi]], whose books may have played a no lesser role in the development of [[postmodernism]], than his stylistic experiments in architecture. R. Venturi first lead attention of architects to [[pop-art]]. In his rejection of architectural modernism Venturi  gave rise to the new cultural setting. By this Venturi showed a deep connection between civilization and architectural forms.&lt;ref&gt;Martin R. Architecture's Image Problem. Have We Ever Been Postmodern // Grey Room, No. 22 (Winter, 2006), pp. 9-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wittgenstein and philosophy of architecture ==
[[File:Wittgenstein haus.jpg|thumb|300px|A photo of Wittgenstein House]]
The [[Wittgenstein House]] is considered one of the most important examples of interactions between philosophy and architecture. Built by renowned [[Austria]]n philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], the house has been the subject of extensive research about the relationship between its stylistic features, Wittgenstein's personality, and his philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Himmelfarb G.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3221">The '''philosophy of film''' is a branch of [[aesthetics]] within the discipline of [[philosophy]] that seeks to understand the most basic questions regarding [[film]]. Philosophy of film has significant overlap with [[film theory]], a branch of [[film studies]].

== History ==
The earliest person to explore philosophical questions regarding film was [[Hugo Münsterberg]]. During the [[silent film]] era, he sought to understand what it was about film that made it conceptually distinct from theater. He concluded that the use of close-ups, flash-backs, and edits were unique to film and constituted its nature.

[[Rudolf Arnheim]], with the beginning of the era of sound for film, argued that the silent film era was aesthetically superior to the "talkies". He held that by adding sound to previously silent moving images, the unique status of film had been removed. Instead of being a unique art form that could carefully study bodies in motion, film had become merely a combination of two other art forms.

[[André Bazin]], contrary to Arnheim, held that whether or not a film has sound is largely irrelevant. He believed that film, due mainly to its foundation in and relationship with photography, had a realist aspect to it. He argued that film has the ability to capture the real world. The film ''[[Waking Life]]'' also features a discussion of the philosophy of film where the theories of Bazin are emphasized. In it, the character waxes philosophic that every moment of film is capturing an aspect of [[God]].

[[American philosopher]] [[Noël Carroll]] has argued that the earlier characterizations of film made by philosophers too narrowly defined the nature of film and that they incorrectly conflated aspects of genres of films with film in general.

Aspects of Bazin's realist theories have been accepted by philosophers in spite of Carroll's critique. The ''transparency thesis'', which says that film is a medium transparent to true reality, has been accepted by [[Kendall Walton]].

The '''philosophy of information''' ('''PI''') is a branch of [[philosophy]] that studies topics relevant to [[computer science]], [[information science]] and [[information technology]].

It includes:
# the critical investigation of the conceptual nature and basic principles of [[information]], including its dynamics, utilisation and sciences
# the elaboration and application of information-theoretic and computational methodologies to philosophical problems.&lt;ref&gt;Luciano Floridi, [http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/pci/downloads/introduction.pdf "What is the Philosophy of Information?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316090017/http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/pci/downloads/introduction.pdf |date=2012-03-16 }}, ''Metaphilosophy'', 2002, (33), 1/2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The philosophy of information (PI) has evolved from the [[philosophy of artificial intelligence]], [[logic of information]], [[cybernetics]], [[social theory]], [[ethics]] and the study of language and information.

===Logic of information===
The [[logic of information]], also known as the ''logical theory of information'', considers the information content of logical [[sign (semiotics)|sign]]s and expressions along the lines initially developed by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]].

===Cybernetics===
One source for the philosophy of information can be found in the technical work of [[Norbert Wiener]], [[Alan Turing]] (though his work has a wholly different origin and theoretical framework), [[William Ross Ashby]], [[Claude Shannon]], [[Warren Weaver]], and many other scientists working on computing and information theory back in the early 1950s. See the main article on [[Cybernetics]].

Some important work on information and communication was done by [[Gregory Bateson]] and his colleagues.

===Study of language and information===
Later contributions to the field were made by [[Fred Dretske]], [[Jon Barwise]], [[Brian Cantwell Smith]], and others.

The [[Center for the Study of Language and Information|Center for the Study of Language and Information (CSLI)]] was founded at Stanford University in 1983 by philosophers, computer scientists, linguists, and psychologists, under the direction of [[John Perry (philosopher)|John Perry]] and [[Jon Barwise]].

===P.I.===
More recently this field has become known as the philosophy of information. The expression was coined in the 1990s by [[Luciano Floridi]], who has published prolifically in this area with the intention of elaborating a unified and coherent, conceptual frame for the whole subject.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Definitions of "information"==

The concept ''information'' has been defined by several theorists.

===Peirce===
[[Charles S. Peirce]]'s theory of information was embedded in his wider theory of symbolic communication he called the ''semeiotic'', now a major part of [[semiotics]]. For Peirce, information integrates the aspects of [[sign]]s and [[Expression (mathematics)|expressions]] separately covered by the concepts of [[denotation]] and [[extension (semantics)|extension]], on the one hand, and by [[connotation]] and [[comprehension (logic)|comprehension]] on the other.

=== Shannon and Weaver ===
Claude E. Shannon, for his part, was very cautious: "The word 'information' has been given different meanings by various writers in the general field of information theory. It is likely that at least a number of these will prove sufficiently useful in certain applications to deserve further study and permanent recognition. It is hardly to be expected that a single concept of information would satisfactorily account for the numerous possible applications of this general field." (Shannon 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;180){{full citation needed|date=April 2015}}. Thus, following Shannon, Weaver supported a tripartite analysis of information in terms of (1) technical problems concerning the quantification of information and dealt with by Shannon's theory; (2) semantic problems relating to meaning and truth; and (3) what he called "influential" problems concerning the impact and effectiveness of information on human behaviour, which he thought had to play an equally important role. And these are only two early examples of the problems raised by any analysis of information.

A map of the main senses in which one may speak of information is provided by  [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/information-semantic/ the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy article]. The previous paragraphs are based on it.

===Bateson===
[[Gregory Bateson]] defined information as "a difference that makes a difference".&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.acadiau.ca/courses/educ/reid/papers/PME25-WS4/SEM.html Extract from "Steps to an Ecology of Mind"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204101244/http://plato.acadiau.ca/courses/educ/reid/papers/PME25-WS4/SEM.html |date=2012-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is based on [[Donald M. MacKay]]: information is a distinction that makes a difference.&lt;ref&gt;The Philosophy of Information.
Luciano Floridi. Chapter 4. Oxford University Press, USA (March 8, 2011) ASIN: 0199232385 [https://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Information-Luciano-Floridi/dp/0199232385]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Floridi===
According to Luciano Floridi{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}, four kinds of mutually compatible phenomena are commonly referred to as "information": 
*  Information about something (e.g. a train timetable)
*  Information as something (e.g. DNA, or fingerprints)
*  Information for something (e.g. algorithms or instructions)
*  Information in something (e.g. a pattern or a constraint).

The word "information" is commonly used so metaphorically or so abstractly that the meaning is unclear.

==Philosophical directions==

===Computing and philosophy===

Recent creative advances and efforts in [[computing]], such as [[semantic web]], [[ontology engineering]], [[knowledge engineering]], and modern [[artificial intelligence]] provide [[philosophy]] with fertile ideas, new and evolving subject matters, methodologies, and models for philosophical inquiry. While [[computer science]] brings new opportunities and challenges to traditional philosophical studies, and changes the ways philosophers understand foundational concepts in philosophy, further major progress in [[computer science]] would only be feasible when philosophy provides sound foundations for areas such as bioinformatics, software engineering, knowledge engineering, and ontologies.

Classical topics in philosophy, namely, [[mind]], [[consciousness]], [[experience]], [[reasoning]], [[knowledge]], [[truth]], [[morality]] and [[creativity]] are rapidly becoming common concerns and foci of investigation in [[computer science]], e.g., in areas such as agent computing, [[software agents]], and intelligent mobile agent technologies.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

According to Luciano Floridi "&lt;ref&gt;Luciano Floridi, [http://www.philosophyofinformation.net/publications/pdf/oppi.pdf ''Open Problems in the Philosophy of Information''] ''Metaphilosophy'' 35.4, 554-582. Revised version of ''The Herbert A. Simon Lecture on Computing and Philosophy'' given at Carnegie Mellon University in 2001, with [https://web.archive.org/web/20020111085711/http://ethics.sandiego.edu/video/CAP/CMU2001/Floridi/index.html RealVideo]&lt;/ref&gt; one can think of several ways for applying computational methods towards philosophical matters:
# Conceptual experiments in silico: As an innovative extension of an ancient tradition of [[thought experiment]], a trend has begun in philosophy to apply computational [[Computer model|modeling]] schemes to questions in [[logic]], [[epistemology]], [[philosophy of science]], [[philosophy of biology]], [[philosophy of mind]], and so on.
# [[Pancomputationalism]]: On this view, computational and informational concepts are considered to be so powerful that given the right level of [[abstraction]], anything in the world could be modeled and represented as a computational system, and any process could be simulated computationally. Then, however, pancomputationalists have the hard task of providing credible answers to the following two questions:
## how can one avoid blurring all differences among systems?
## what would it mean for the system under investigation not to be an [[Information system|informational system]] (or a computational system, if computation is the same as information processing)?

===Information and society===
Numerous philosophers and other thinkers have carried out philosophical studies of the social and cultural aspects of electronically mediated information.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2540">'''Postanalytic philosophy''' describes a detachment from the mainstream philosophical movement of [[analytic philosophy]], which is the predominant school of thought in [[English-speaking countries]]. Postanalytic philosophy derives mainly from contemporary American thought, especially from the works of philosophers [[Richard Rorty]], [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]], [[Hilary Putnam]], [[W. V. O. Quine]], and [[Stanley Cavell]]. The term is closely associated with the much broader movement of contemporary [[American pragmatism]], which, loosely defined, advocates a detachment from the definition of 'objective truth' given by modern philosophers such as Descartes. Postanalytic philosophers emphasize the contingency of human thought, [[convention (norm)|convention]], [[utility]], and [[social progress]].

==On "postanalytic philosophy"==
The term "postanalytic philosophy" itself has been used in a vaguely descriptive sense and not in the sense of a concrete philosophical movement. Many postanalytic philosophers write along an analytic vein and on traditionally analytic topics. Richard Rorty said: "I think that analytic philosophy can keep its highly professional methods, the insistence on detail and mechanics, and just drop its transcendental project. I'm not out to criticize analytic philosophy as a style. It's a good style. I think the years of superprofessionalism were beneficial."&lt;ref&gt;Eduardo Mendieta, ''Take Care of Freedom and Truth Will Take Care of Itself'', 2005, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

Rorty says the goal of postanalytic philosophy is not to oppose analytic philosophy or its methods, but to dispute its hope to make philosophy the penultimate form of knowledge from which every other knowledge claim must be derived. 

Postanalytic philosophy may also be known as '''post-philosophy''',&lt;ref&gt;Christopher J. Voparil, Richard J. Bernstein, ''The Rorty Reader'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2010, p. 493.&lt;/ref&gt; a term used by Rorty, to emphasize the notion that the project of philosophy as conceived by Enlightenment philosophers no longer serves the role it used to in society and that this role has been replaced by other media.

The '''problem of other minds''' is a philosophical problem traditionally stated as the following [[Epistemology|epistemological]] challenge raised by the [[Skepticism|skeptic]]: given that I can only observe the [[behavior]] of others, how can I know that others have [[mind]]s?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/other-minds/|first=Alec|last=Hyslop|title=Other Minds|editor1-last=Zalta|editor1-first=Edward N.|editor2-last=Nodelman|editor2-first=Uri|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Center for the Study of Language and Information, Stanford University|issn=1095-5054|date=14 January 2014|accessdate=May 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a central tenet of the philosophical idea known as [[solipsism]]; the notion that for any person only one's own mind is known to exist. Solipsism maintains that no matter how sophisticated someone's behavior is, behavior on its own does not guarantee the presence of mentality.

'''Process philosophy''' — also '''ontology of becoming''', '''processism''',&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Rescher]], ''Process Metaphysics: An Introduction to Process Philosophy'', SUNY Press, 1996, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''philosophy of organism'''&lt;ref&gt;[[Dorothy Emmet]], 1932, ''Whitehead's Philosophy of Organism'', London: Macmillan; 2nd edn, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; — identifies [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] [[reality]] with [[Change (philosophy)|change]]. In opposition to the classical model of change as illusory (as argued by Parmenides) or accidental (as argued by Aristotle), process philosophy regards change as the cornerstone of reality—the cornerstone of [[being]] thought of as [[Becoming (philosophy)|becoming]].

Since the time of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], philosophers have posited true reality as "timeless", based on permanent [[Substance theory|substance]]s, while processes are denied or subordinated to timeless substances. If [[Socrates]] changes, becoming sick, Socrates is still the same (the substance of Socrates being the same), and change (his sickness) only glides over his substance: change is accidental, whereas the substance is essential. Therefore, classic [[ontology]] denies any full reality to change, which is conceived as only accidental and not essential. This classical ontology is what made knowledge and a [[theory of knowledge]] possible, as it was thought that a science of something in becoming was an impossible feat to achieve.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Fagot-Largeau, [http://www.college-de-france.fr/default/EN/all/phi_sci/p1184676830986.htm 7 December 2006 course] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206183341/http://www.college-de-france.fr/default/EN/all/phi_sci/p1184676830986.htm |date=6 February 2009 }} at the [[Collège of France]], first part of a series of courses on the "Ontology of Becoming" {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophers who appeal to process rather than substance include [[Heraclitus]], [[Karl Marx]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/24196-marx-and-whitehead-process-dialectics-and-the-critique-of-capitalism/ Marx and Whitehead: Process, Dialectics, and the Critique of Capitalism]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Henri Bergson]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[William James]],  [[Alfred North Whitehead]], [[Alfred Korzybski]], [[R. G. Collingwood]], [[Alan Watts]], [[Robert M. Pirsig]], [[Charles Hartshorne]], [[Arran Gare]], [[Nicholas Rescher]], [[Colin Wilson]], [[Jacques Derrida]], and [[Gilles Deleuze]]. In physics, [[Ilya Prigogine]]&lt;ref&gt;Ilya Prigogine, ''From being to becoming'', W. H. Freeman and Company, San Francisco, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; distinguishes between the "physics of being" and the "physics of becoming". Process philosophy covers not just scientific intuitions and experiences, but can be used as a conceptual bridge to facilitate discussions among religion, philosophy, and science.&lt;ref name="Hustwit"&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeremy R. Hustwit|title=Process Philosophy: 2.a. In Pursuit of a Holistic Worldview |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/processp/#SH2a|publisher=[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Michel Weber]] (ed.), ''[https://www.academia.edu/6359324/Michel_Weber_ed._After_Whitehead_Rescher_on_Process_Metaphysics_2004 After Whitehead: Rescher on Process Metaphysics]'', Frankfurt / Paris / Lancaster, Ontos Verlag, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Process philosophy is sometimes classified as closer to [[Continental philosophy]] than [[analytic philosophy]], because it is usually only taught in Continental departments.&lt;ref&gt;William Blattner, [http://faculty.georgetown.edu/blattnew/contanalytic.html "Some Thoughts About "Continental" and "Analytic" Philosophy"]&lt;/ref&gt; However, other sources state that process philosophy should be placed somewhere in the middle between the poles of analytic versus Continental methods in contemporary philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=process-philosophy |title=Process Philosophy |last=Seibt |first=Johanna}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Gaskill, A. J. Nocek, ''The Lure of Whitehead'', University of Minnesota Press, 2014, p. 4: "it is no wonder that Whitehead fell by the wayside. He was too scientific for the "continentals," not scientific enough for the "analytics," and too metaphysical—which is to say [[Critical philosophy|uncritical]]—for them both" and p. 231: "the analytics and Continentals are both inclined toward [[Kantianism|Kantian]] presuppositions in a manner that Latour and Whitehead brazenly renounce."&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Original research|date=September 2007}}

=== In ancient Greek thought ===

Heraclitus proclaimed that the basic nature of all things is change.

The quotation from [[Heraclitus]] appears in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' twice; in 401d as:&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' Paragraph [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0171%3Atext%3DCrat.%3Asection%3D401d Crat. 401 section d line 5].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;{{lang|grc|τὰ ὄντα ἰέναι τε πάντα καὶ μένειν οὐδέν}}&lt;br/&gt;''Ta onta ienai te panta kai menein ouden''&lt;br/&gt;"All entities move and nothing remains still"&lt;/blockquote&gt;and in 402a&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plat.+Crat.+402&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0171 Paragraph 402 section a line 8].&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;{{lang|grc|"πάντα χωρεῖ καὶ οὐδὲν μένει" καὶ "δὶς ἐς τὸν αὐτὸν ποταμὸν οὐκ ἂν ἐμβαίης"}}&lt;br/&gt;''Panta chōrei kai ouden menei kai dis es ton auton potamon ouk an embaies''
&lt;br /&gt;"Everything changes and nothing remains still&amp;nbsp;... and&amp;nbsp;... you cannot step twice into the same stream"&lt;ref&gt;This sentence has been translated by [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] in Epistulae, [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/sen/seneca.ep6.shtml VI, 58, 23].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Heraclitus considered fire as the most fundamental element.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"All things are an interchange for fire, and fire for all things, just like goods for gold and gold for goods."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harris|first1=William|title=Heraclitus: The Complete Philosophical Fragments|url=http://community.middlebury.edu/~harris/Philosophy/Heraclitus.html|website=Middlebury College|accessdate=3 October 2015|ref=DK B90}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The following is an interpretation of Heraclitus's concepts into modern terms by Nicholas Rescher.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"...reality is not a constellation of things at all, but one of processes.  The fundamental "stuff" of the world is not material substance, but volatile flux, namely "fire", and all things are versions thereof (puros tropai).  Process is fundamental: the river is not an object, but a continuing flow; the sun is not a thing, but an enduring fire.  Everything is a matter of process, of activity, of change (panta rhei)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rescher|first1=Nicholas|title=Process philosophy a survey of basic issues|date=2000|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|location=[Pittsburgh]|isbn=0822961288|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An early expression of this viewpoint is in [[Heraclitus]]'s fragments. He posits strife, ''ἡ ἔρις'' (strife, conflict), as the underlying basis of all reality defined by change.&lt;ref&gt;Wheelwright, P. (1959). ''Heraclitus'', Oxford University Press, Oxford UK, {{ISBN|0-19-924022-1}}, p.35.&lt;/ref&gt; The balance and opposition in strife were the foundations of change and stability in the flux of existence.

===Twentieth century===
In early twentieth century, the [[philosophy of mathematics]] was undertaken to develop mathematics as an airtight, axiomatic system in which every truth could be derived logically from a set of axioms. In the [[foundations of mathematics]], this project is variously understood as [[logicism]] or as part of the [[Formalism (philosophy)|formalist]] program of [[David Hilbert]]. [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and [[Bertrand Russell]] attempted to complete, or at least facilitate, this program with their seminal book [[Principia Mathematica]], which purported to build a logically consistent [[set theory]] on which to found mathematics. After this, Whitehead extended his interest to natural science, which he held needed a deeper philosophical basis. He intuited that natural science was struggling to overcome a traditional ontology of timeless material substances that does not suit natural phenomena. According to Whitehead, material is more properly understood as 'process'. In 1929, he produced the most famous work of process philosophy, ''[[Process and Reality]]'',&lt;ref name="Whitehead 1929"/&gt; continuing the work begun by [[Hegel]] but describing a more complex and fluid dynamic ontology.

Process thought describes truth as "movement" in and through substance ([[Hegelian]] truth), rather than [[substance theory|substances]] as fixed concepts or "things" ([[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] truth). Since Whitehead, process thought is distinguished from [[Hegel]] in that it describes entities that arise or coalesce in ''becoming'', rather than being simply dialectically determined from prior posited determinates. These entities are referred to as ''complexes of occasions of experience''. It is also distinguished in being not necessarily conflictual or oppositional in operation. Process may be integrative, destructive or both together, allowing for aspects of interdependence, influence, and confluence, and addressing coherence in universal as well as particular developments, i.e., those aspects not befitting Hegel's system. Additionally, instances of determinate occasions of experience, while always ephemeral, are nonetheless seen as important to define the type and continuity of those occasions of experience that flow from or relate to them.

==Whitehead's ''Process and Reality''==
[[Alfred North Whitehead]] began teaching and writing on process and metaphysics when he joined [[Harvard University]] in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/whitehed/|title= Alfred North Whitehead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Science and the Modern World'' (1925), Whitehead noted that the human intuitions and experiences of science, aesthetics, ethics, and religion influence the worldview of a community, but that in the last several centuries science dominates [[Western culture]]. Whitehead sought a holistic, comprehensive [[Cosmology (philosophy)|cosmology]] that provides a systematic descriptive theory of the world which can be used for the diverse human intuitions gained through ethical, aesthetic, religious, and scientific experiences, and not just the scientific.&lt;ref name="Hustwit"/&gt;

Whitehead's influences were not restricted to philosophers or physicists or mathematicians. He was influenced by the French philosopher [[Henri Bergson]] (1859–1941), whom he credits along with [[William James]] and [[John Dewey]] in the preface to ''Process and Reality''.&lt;ref name="Whitehead 1929"&gt;Whitehead, A. N. (1929). ''Process and Reality'', Macmillan, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Process metaphysics===

For Whitehead, metaphysics is about logical frameworks for the conduct of discussions of the character of the world. It is not directly and immediately about facts of nature, but only indirectly so, in that its task is to explicitly formulate the language and conceptual presuppositions that are used to describe the facts of nature. Whitehead thinks that discovery of previously unknown facts of nature can in principle call for reconstruction of metaphysics.&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead, A. N. (1929), pp. 13, 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The process metaphysics elaborated in ''[[Process and Reality]]''&lt;ref name="Whitehead 1929"/&gt; posits an ontology which is based on the two kinds of existence of [[entity]], that of actual entity and that of abstract entity or [[abstraction]], also called 'object'.&lt;ref&gt;Palter, R.M. (1960). ''Whitehead's Philosophy of Science'', University of Chicago Press, Chicago IL, p.&amp;nbsp;23.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Actual entity''' is a term coined by Whitehead to refer to the entities that really exist in the natural world.&lt;ref name="Audi (ed.)"&gt;Robert Audi. 1995, ''The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy.'' Cambridge: The Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge. 851–853.&lt;/ref&gt; For Whitehead, actual entities are spatiotemporally extended events or processes.&lt;ref name="Cobb"/&gt; An actual entity is how something is happening, and how its happening is related to other actual entities.&lt;ref name="Cobb"/&gt; The actually existing world is a multiplicity of actual entities overlapping one another.&lt;ref name="Cobb"/&gt;

The ultimate abstract principle of actual existence for Whitehead is '''creativity'''. Creativity is a term coined by Whitehead to show a power in the world that allows the presence of an actual entity, a new actual entity, and multiple actual entities.&lt;ref name="Cobb"/&gt; Creativity is the principle of novelty.&lt;ref name="Audi (ed.)"/&gt; It is manifest in what can be called 'singular causality'. This term may be contrasted with the term 'nomic causality'. An example of singular causation is that I woke this morning because my alarm clock rang. An example of nomic causation is that alarm clocks generally wake people in the morning. Aristotle recognizes singular causality as [[Four causes#Efficient cause|efficient causality]]. For Whitehead, there are many contributory singular causes for an event. A further contributory singular cause of my being awoken by my alarm clock this morning was that I was lying asleep near it till it rang.

An actual entity is a general philosophical term for an utterly determinate and completely concrete individual particular of the actually existing world or universe of [[Metaphysics (Aristotle)#IX: Theta|changeable entities]] considered in terms of singular causality, about which categorical statements can be made. Whitehead's most far-reaching and radical contribution to metaphysics is his invention of a better way of choosing the actual entities. Whitehead chooses a way of defining the actual entities that makes them all alike, ''qua'' actual entities, with a single exception.

For example, for [[Aristotle]], the actual entities were the [[Metaphysics (Aristotle)#Summary#Zeta|substance]]s, such as Socrates. Besides Aristotle's ontology of substances, another example of an ontology that posits actual entities is in the [[Monadology|monads]] of [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]], which are said to be 'windowless'.

====Whitehead's actual entities====

For Whitehead's ontology of processes as defining the world, the actual entities exist as the only fundamental elements of reality.

The actual entities are of two kinds, temporal and atemporal.

With one exception, all actual entities for Whitehead are '''temporal''' and are '''[[wiktionary:actual occasions|occasions of experience]]''' (which are not to be confused with [[consciousness]]). An entity that people commonly think of as a simple concrete [[object (philosophy)|object]], or that Aristotle would think of as a substance, is, in this ontology, considered to be a temporally serial composite of indefinitely many overlapping occasions of experience. A human being is thus composed of indefinitely many occasions of experience.

The one exceptional actual entity is at once both temporal and '''atemporal''': God. He is objectively immortal, as well as being immanent in the world. He is objectified in each temporal actual entity; but He is not an eternal object.

The occasions of experience are of four grades. The first grade comprises processes in a physical vacuum such as the propagation of an electromagnetic wave or gravitational influence across empty space. The occasions of experience of the second grade involve just inanimate matter; "matter" being the composite overlapping of occasions of experience from the previous grade. The occasions of experience of the third grade involve living organisms. Occasions of experience of the fourth grade involve experience in the mode of presentational immediacy, which means more or less what are often called the [[qualia]] of subjective experience. So far as we know, experience in the mode of presentational immediacy occurs in only more evolved animals. That some occasions of experience involve experience in the mode of presentational immediacy is the one and only reason why Whitehead makes the occasions of experience his actual entities; for the actual entities must be of the ultimately general kind. Consequently, it is inessential that an occasion of experience have an aspect in the mode of presentational immediacy; occasions of the grades one, two, and three, lack that aspect.

There is no [[Mind-body dualism|mind-matter duality]] in this ontology, because "mind" is simply seen as an abstraction from an occasion of experience which has also a material aspect, which is of course simply another abstraction from it; thus the mental aspect and the material aspect are abstractions from one and the same concrete occasion of experience. The brain is part of the body, both being abstractions of a kind known as ''persistent physical objects'', neither being actual entities. Though not recognized by Aristotle, there is biological evidence, written about by [[Galen]],&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, R. E. (1973). ''Galen: On Psychology, Psychopathology, and Function and Diseases of the Nervous System. An Analysis of his Doctrines, Observations, and Experiments'', Karger, Basel, {{ISBN|978-3-8055-1479-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that the human brain is an essential seat of human experience in the mode of presentational immediacy. We may say that the brain has a material and a mental aspect, all three being abstractions from their indefinitely many constitutive occasions of experience, which are actual entities.

=====Time, causality, and process=====

Inherent in each actual entity is its respective dimension of time. Potentially, each Whiteheadean occasion of experience is causally consequential on every other occasion of experience that precedes it in time, and has as its causal consequences every other occasion of experience that follows it in time; thus it has been said that Whitehead's occasions of experience are 'all window', in contrast to Leibniz's 'windowless' monads. In time defined relative to it, each occasion of experience is causally influenced by prior occasions of experiences, and causally influences future occasions of experience. An occasion of experience consists of a process of prehending other occasions of experience, reacting to them. This is the process in process philosophy.

Such process is never deterministic. Consequently, [[free will]] is essential and inherent to the universe.

The causal outcomes obey the usual well-respected rule that the causes precede the effects in time. Some pairs of processes cannot be connected by cause-and-effect relations, and they are said to be [[Spacetime#Basic concepts#Space-like interval|spatially separated]]. This is in perfect agreement with the viewpoint of the Einstein theory of [[special relativity]] and with the [[Minkowski space|Minkowski geometry]] of spacetime.&lt;ref name="Naber"&gt;Naber, G. L. (1992). ''The Geometry of Minkowski Spacetime. An Introduction to the Mathematics of the Special Theory of Relativity'', Springer, New York, {{ISBN|978-0-387-97848-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is clear that Whitehead respected these ideas, as may be seen for example in his 1919 book ''An Enquiry concerning the Principles of Natural Knowledge''&lt;ref name="Whitehead 1919"&gt;Whitehead, A. N. (1919). ''An Enquiry concerning the Principles of Natural Knowledge'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in ''[[Process and Reality]]''. Time in this view is relative to an inertial reference frame, different reference frames defining different versions of time.

=====Atomicity=====

The actual entities, the occasions of experience, are logically '''atomic''' in the sense that an occasion of experience cannot be cut and separated into two other occasions of experience. This kind of logical atomicity is perfectly compatible with indefinitely many spatio-temporal overlaps of occasions of experience. One can explain this kind of atomicity by saying that an occasion of experience has an internal causal structure that could not be reproduced in each of the two complementary sections into which it might be cut. Nevertheless, an actual entity can completely contain each of indefinitely many other actual entities.

Another aspect of the atomicity of occasions of experience is that they do not change. An actual entity is what it is. An occasion of experience can be described as a process of change, but it is itself unchangeable.

The reader should bear in mind that the atomicity of the actual entities is of a simply logical or philosophical kind, thoroughly different in concept from the natural kind of atomicity that describes the [[atom]]s of [[physics]] and [[chemistry]].

=====Topology=====

Whitehead's theory of extension was concerned with the spatio-temporal features of his occasions of experience. Fundamental to both Newtonian and to quantum theoretical mechanics is the concept of velocity. The measurement of a velocity requires a finite spatiotemporal extent. Because it has no finite spatiotemporal extent, a single point of Minkowski space cannot be an occasion of experience, but is an abstraction from an infinite set of overlapping or contained occasions of experience, as explained in ''Process and Reality''.&lt;ref name="Whitehead 1929"/&gt; Though the occasions of experience are atomic, they are not necessarily separate in extension, spatiotemporally, from one another. Indefinitely many occasions of experience can '''overlap''' in Minkowski space.

Nexus is a term coined by Whitehead to show the network actual entity from universe. In the universe of actual entities spread&lt;ref name="Audi (ed.)"/&gt; actual entity. Actual entities are clashing with each other and form other actual entities.&lt;ref name="Cobb"/&gt; The birth of an actual entity based on an actual entity, actual entities around him referred to as nexus.&lt;ref name="Audi (ed.)"/&gt;

An example of a nexus of temporally overlapping occasions of experience is what Whitehead calls an '''enduring physical object''', which corresponds closely with an Aristotelian substance. An enduring physical object has a temporally earliest and a temporally last member. Every member (apart from the earliest) of such a nexus is a causal consequence of the earliest member of the nexus, and every member (apart from the last) of such a nexus is a causal antecedent of the last member of the nexus. There are indefinitely many other causal antecedents and consequences of the enduring physical object, which overlap, but are not members, of the nexus. No member of the nexus is spatially separate from any other member. Within the nexus are indefinitely many continuous streams of overlapping nexūs, each stream including the earliest and the last member of the enduring physical object. Thus an enduring physical object, like an Aristotelian substance, undergoes changes and adventures during the course of its existence.

In some contexts, especially in the [[theory of relativity]] in physics, the word 'event' refers to a single point in Minkowski or in Riemannian space-time. A point event is not a process in the sense of Whitehead's metaphysics. Neither is a countable sequence or array of points. A Whiteheadian process is most importantly characterized by extension in space-time, marked by a continuum of uncountably many points in a Minkowski or a Riemannian space-time. The word 'event', indicating a Whiteheadian actual entity, is not being used in the sense of a point event.

====Whitehead's abstractions====

Whitehead's '''abstractions''' are conceptual entities that are abstracted from or derived from and founded upon his actual entities. Abstractions are themselves not actual entities. They are the only entities that can be real but are not actual entities. This statement is one form of Whitehead's 'ontological principle'.

An abstraction is a conceptual entity that refers to more than one single actual entity. Whitehead's ontology refers to importantly structured collections of actual entities as nexuses of actual entities. Collection of actual entities into a '''nexus''' emphasizes some aspect of those entities, and that emphasis is an abstraction, because it means that some aspects of the actual entities are emphasized or dragged away from their actuality, while other aspects are de-emphasized or left out or left behind.

'Eternal object' is a term coined by Whitehead. It is an abstraction, a possibility, or pure potential. It can be ingredient into some actual entity.&lt;ref name="Audi (ed.)"/&gt; It is a principle that can give a particular form to an actual entity.&lt;ref name="Cobb" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Michel Weber]] (ed.), ''[https://www.academia.edu/279952/After_Whitehead_Rescher_on_Process_Metaphysics After Whitehead: Rescher on Process Metaphysics]'', Frankfurt / Paris / Lancaster, Ontos Verlag, 2004 ({{ISBN|3-937202-49-8}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitehead admitted indefinitely many eternal objects. An example of an '''eternal object''' is a number, such as the number 'two'. Whitehead held that eternal objects are abstractions of a very high degree of abstraction. Many abstractions, including eternal objects, are potential ingredients of processes.

====Relation between actual entities and abstractions stated in the ontological principle====

For Whitehead, besides its temporal generation by the actual entities which are its contributory causes, a process may be considered as a concrescence of abstract '''ingredient''' eternal objects. God enters into every temporal actual entity.

Whitehead's '''ontological principle''' is that whatever reality pertains to an abstraction is derived from the actual entities upon which it is founded or of which it is comprised.

====Causation and concrescence of a process====
Concrescence is a term coined by Whitehead to show the process of jointly forming an actual entity that was without form, but about to manifest itself into an entity Actual full (''satisfaction'') based on datums or for information on the universe.&lt;ref name="Audi (ed.)"/&gt; The process of forming an actual entity is the case based on the existing datums. Concretion process can be regarded as ''subjectification process.''&lt;ref name="Cobb"&gt;John B. Cobb and David Ray Griffin. 1976, ''Process Theology, An Introduction. Philadelphia: The Westminster Press.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Datum is a term coined by Whitehead to show the different variants of information possessed by actual entity. In process philosophy, datum is obtained through the events of concrescence. Every actual entity has a variety of datum.&lt;ref name="Audi (ed.)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cobb"/&gt;

==Commentary on Whitehead and on process philosophy==
Whitehead is not an [[idealism|idealist]] in the strict sense.{{which|date=May 2013}} Whitehead's thought may be regarded as related to the idea of [[panpsychism]] (also known as panexperientialism, because of Whitehead's emphasis on experience).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Seager|first1=William|title=Whitehead and the Revival (?) of Panpsychism|url=http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~seager/whitehead.htm|website=University of Toronto Scarborough|publisher=University of Toronto at Scarborough|accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== On God ===
Whitehead's philosophy is very complex, subtle and nuanced and in order to comprehend his thinking regarding what is commonly referred to by many religions as "God", it is recommended that one read from ''Process and Reality Corrected Edition'', wherein regarding "God" the authors elaborate Whitehead's conception.
&lt;blockquote&gt;"He is the unconditioned actuality of conceptual feeling at the base of things; so that by reason of this primordial actuality, there is an order in the relevance of eternal objects to the process of creation (343 of 413) (Location 7624 of 9706 Kindle ed.)  Whitehead continues later with, "The particularities of the actual world presuppose it ; while it merely presupposes the general metaphysical character of creative advance, of which it is the primordial exemplification (344 of 413) (Location 7634 of 9706 Kindle Edition)." &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Process philosophy, might be considered according to some theistic forms of religion to give a [[God#Process theology and process philosophy definition of God|God]] a special place in the universe of occasions of experience. Regarding Whitehead's use of the term, "occasions" in reference to, "God" it is explained in ''Process and Reality Corrected Edition'' that &lt;blockquote&gt;"'Actual entities'-also termed 'actual occasions'-are the final real things of which the world is made up. There is no going behind actual entities to find anything [28] more real.  They differ among themselves: God is an actual entity, and so is the most trivial puff of existence in far-off empty space.  But, though there are gradations of importance, and diversities of function, yet in the principles which actuality exemplifies all are on the same level.  The final facts are, all alike, actual entities; and these actual entities are drops of experience, complex and interdependent.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It can be also be assumed within some forms of theology that a God encompasses all the other occasions of experience but also transcends them and this might lead to it being argued that Whitehead endorses some form of [[panentheism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cooper|first1=John W.|title=Panentheism--The Other God of the Philosophers: From Plato to the Present|date=2006|publisher=Baker Academic|location=Grand Rapids MI|isbn=978-0801049316|page=176|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aokfbkOdjuEC&amp;pg=PA176&amp;dq=Whitehead++panentheism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwilv8Xpxb7UAhVGOCYKHaBCB-UQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Whitehead%20%20panentheism&amp;f=false|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since, it is argued theologically, that "free will" is inherent to the nature of the universe, Whitehead's God is not omnipotent in Whitehead's metaphysics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dombrowski|first1=Daniel A.|title=Whitehead's Religious Thought: From Mechanism to Organism, From Force to Persuasion|date=2017|publisher=State Univ of New York Pr|location=Albany|isbn=978-1438464299|pages=33–35|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ACKRDQAAQBAJ&amp;dq=Whitehead%27s+God+is+not+omnipotent&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  God's role is to offer enhanced occasions of experience. God participates in the evolution of the universe by offering possibilities, which may be accepted or rejected. Whitehead's thinking here has given rise to [[process theology]], whose prominent advocates include [[Charles Hartshorne]], [[John B. Cobb, Jr.]], and [[Hans Jonas]], who was also influenced by the non-theological philosopher Martin Heidegger. However, other process philosophers have questioned Whitehead's theology, seeing it as a regressive Platonism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hustwit|first1=J. R.|title=Process Philosophy|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/processp/|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy (IEP)|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitehead enumerated three essential ''natures of God''. The ''primordial'' nature of God consists of all potentialities of existence for actual occasions, which Whitehead dubbed eternal objects. God can offer possibilities by ordering the relevance of eternal objects. The ''consequent'' nature of God prehends everything that happens in reality. As such, God experiences all of reality in a sentient manner. The last nature is the ''superjective''. This is the way in which God's synthesis becomes a sense-datum for other actual entities. In some sense, God is prehended by existing actual entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Viney|first1=Donald|title=Process Theism|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/process-theism/|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosoph|publisher=Center for the Study of Language and Information (CSLI), Stanford University|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy and applications ==
=== Biology ===
In [[plant morphology]], [[Rolf Sattler]] developed a process morphology (dynamic morphology) that overcomes the structure/process (or structure/function) dualism that is commonly taken for granted in biology. According to process morphology, structures such as leaves of plants do not have processes, they ''are'' processes.&lt;ref&gt;Sattler, R. 1990. "Towards a more dynamic plant morphology". ''[[Acta Biotheoretica]]'' 38: 303–315&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sattler, R. 1992. "Process morphology: structural dynamics in development and evolution". ''[[Canadian Journal of Botany]]'' 70: 708–714.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[evolution]] and in [[Developmental biology|development]], the nature of the changes of biological objects are considered by many authors to be more radical than in physical systems. In biology, changes are not just changes of state in a pre-given space, instead the space and more generally the mathematical structures required to understand object change over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Montévil|first=Maël|last2=Mossio|first2=Matteo|last3=Pocheville|first3=Arnaud|last4=Longo|first4=Giuseppe|date=2016-10-01|year=|title=Theoretical principles for biology: Variation|url=https://www.academia.edu/27942089/Theoretical_principles_for_biology_Variation|journal=Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology|series=From the Century of the Genome to the Century of the Organism: New Theoretical Approaches|volume=122|issue=1|pages=36–50|doi=10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2016.08.005|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Longo|first=Giuseppe|last2=Montévil|first2=Maël|last3=Kauffman|first3=Stuart|date=2012-01-01|year=|title=No Entailing Laws, but Enablement in the Evolution of the Biosphere|url=https://www.academia.edu/11720588/No_entailing_laws_but_enablement_in_the_evolution_of_the_biosphere|journal=Proceedings of the 14th Annual Conference Companion on Genetic and Evolutionary Computation|series=GECCO '12|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|volume=|pages=1379–1392|doi=10.1145/2330784.2330946|isbn=9781450311786|via=|arxiv=1201.2069}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ecology ===
With its perspective that everything is interconnected, that all life has value, and that non-human entities are also experiencing subjects, process philosophy has played an important role in discourse on ecology and sustainability. The first book to connect process philosophy with environmental ethics was [[John B. Cobb, Jr.]]'s 1971 work, ''Is It Too Late: A Theology of Ecology''.&lt;ref name="Is It Too Late"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cobb, Jr. |first1=John B. |title=Is It Too Late?: A Theology of Ecology |date=1971 |publisher=Macmillan Publishing Company |isbn=978-0028012803 |url=https://www.amazon.com/too-late-theology-ecology/dp/0962680737}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a more recent book (2018) edited by [[John B. Cobb, Jr.]] and Wm. Andrew Schwartz, ''Putting Philosophy to Work: Toward an Ecological Civilization''&lt;ref name="Putting Philosophy to Work"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cobb, Jr. |first1=John B. |last2=Scwhartz |first2=Wm. Andrew |title=Putting Philosophy to Work: Toward an Ecological Civilization |date=2018 |publisher=Process Century Press |location=Minnesota |isbn=978-1940447339 |url=https://www.amazon.com/Putting-Philosophy-Work-Ecological-Civilization/dp/194044733X}}&lt;/ref&gt; contributors explicitly explore the ways in which process philosophy can be put to work to address the most urgent issues facing our world today, by contributing to a transition toward an ecological civilization. That book emerged out of the largest international conference held on the theme of [[ecological civilization]] (''Seizing an Alternative: Toward an Ecological Civilization'') which was organized by the Center for Process Studies in June 2015. The conference brought together roughly 2,000 participants from around the world and featured such leaders in the environmental movement as [[Bill McKibben]], [[Vandana Shiva]], [[John B. Cobb, Jr.]], [[Wes Jackson]], and [[Sheri Liao]].&lt;ref name="conferencereport"&gt;Herman Greene, [http://www.ecozoicsocieties.org/musings/2015/re-imagining-civilization-as-ecological-report-on-the-seizing-an-alternative-toward-an-ecological-civilization-conference/ "Re-Imagining Civilization as Ecological: Report on the 'Seizing an Alternative: Toward an Ecological Civilization' Conference"], last modified August 24, 2015, ''Center for Ecozoic Societies'', accessed November 1, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of [[ecological civilization]] is often affiliated with the process philosophy of [[Alfred North Whitehead]]--especially in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wang |first1=Zhihe |last2=Huili |first2=He |last3=Meijun |first3=Fan |title=The Ecological Civilization Debate in China: The Role of Ecological Marxism and Constructive Postmodernism—Beyond the Predicament of Legislation |url=https://monthlyreview.org/2014/11/01/the-ecological-civilization-debate-in-china/ |website=Monthly Review |accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mathematics ===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}
In the [[philosophy of mathematics]], some of Whitehead's ideas re-emerged in combination with [[Cognitivism (ethics)|cognitivism]] as the [[cognitive science of mathematics]] and [[embodied mind]] theses.

Somewhat earlier, exploration of [[mathematical practice]] and [[quasi-empiricism in mathematics]] from the 1950s to 1980s had sought alternatives to [[metamathematics]] in social behaviours around [[mathematics]] itself: for instance, [[Paul Erdős]]'s simultaneous belief in [[Platonism]] and a single "big book" in which all proofs existed, combined with his personal obsessive need or decision to collaborate with the widest possible number of other mathematicians. The process, rather than the outcomes, seemed to drive his explicit behaviour and odd use of language, as if the synthesis of Erdős and collaborators in seeking proofs, creating sense-datum for other mathematicians, was itself the expression of a divine will. Certainly, Erdős behaved as if nothing else in the world mattered, including money or love, as emphasized in his biography ''[[The Man Who Loved Only Numbers]]''.

=== Medicine ===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}
Several fields of science and especially [[medicine]] seem {{vague|date=May 2013}} to make liberal use of ideas in process philosophy, notably the theory of [[pain]] and [[healing]] of the late 20th century. The [[Philosophy of healthcare|philosophy of medicine]] began to deviate somewhat from [[scientific method]] and an emphasis on repeatable results in the very late 20th century by embracing [[Health system|population thinking]], and a more pragmatic approach to issues in [[public health]], [[environmental health]] and especially [[mental health]]. In this latter field, [[R. D. Laing]], [[Thomas Szasz]] and [[Michel Foucault]] were instrumental in moving medicine away from emphasis on "cures" and towards concepts of individuals in balance with their society, both of which are changing, and against which no benchmarks or finished "cures" were very likely to be measurable.

=== Psychology ===
In [[psychology]], the subject of imagination was again explored more extensively since Whitehead, and the question of feasibility or "eternal objects" of thought became central to the impaired [[theory of mind]] explorations that framed postmodern [[cognitive science]]. A biological understanding of the most eternal object, that being the emerging of similar but independent cognitive apparatus, led to an obsession with the process "embodiment", that being, the emergence of these [[cognition]]s. Like Whitehead's God, especially as elaborated in [[J. J. Gibson]]'s [[perceptual psychology]] emphasizing [[affordance]]s, by ordering the relevance of eternal objects (especially the cognitions of other such actors), the world becomes. Or, it becomes simple enough for human beings to begin to make choices, and to prehend what happens as a result. These experiences may be summed in some sense but can only approximately be shared, even among very similar cognitions with identical DNA. An early explorer of this view was [[Alan Turing]] who sought to prove the limits of expressive complexity of human genes in the late 1940s, to put bounds on the complexity of human [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] and so assess the feasibility of [[artificial intelligence]] emerging. Since 2000, Process Psychology has progressed as an independent academic and therapeutic discipline: In 2000, [[Michel Weber]] created the Whitehead Psychology Nexus: an open forum dedicated to the cross-examination of Alfred North Whitehead's process philosophy and the various facets of the contemporary psychological field.&lt;ref&gt;Cobb, John B., Jr. "Process Psychotherapy: Introduction".

[[File:Paolo Monti - Servizio fotografico (Napoli, 1969) - BEIC 6353768.jpg|thumb|[[Zeno of Citium]], bust in the [[Farnese collection]], Naples – Photo by [[Paolo Monti]], 1969.]]

'''Stoicism''' is a school of [[Hellenistic philosophy]] founded by [[Zeno of Citium]] in Athens in the early 3rd century BC. It was heavily influenced by certain teachings of [[Socrates]], while [[Stoic physics]] are largely drawn from the teachings of the philosopher [[Heraclitus]]. Stoicism is predominantly a philosophy of personal ethics informed by its system of logic and its views on the natural world. According to its teachings, as social beings, the path to happiness for humans is found in accepting the moment as it presents itself, by not allowing oneself to be controlled by the desire for pleasure or fear of pain, by using one’s mind to understand the world and to do one’s part in nature's plan, and by working together and treating others fairly and justly.

The Stoics are especially known for teaching that "virtue is the only good" for human beings, and that external things—such as health, wealth, and pleasure—are not good or bad in themselves, but have value as "material for virtue to act upon".  Alongside [[Aristotelian ethics]], the Stoic tradition forms one of the major founding approaches to Western [[virtue ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharpe, Matthew. "[http://dro.deakin.edu.au/eserv/DU:30059463/sharpe-stoicvirtue-2013.pdf Stoic Virtue Ethics]." ''Handbook of Virtue Ethics'', 2013, 28–41.&lt;/ref&gt; The Stoics also held that certain destructive emotions resulted from errors of judgment, and they believed people should aim to maintain a will (called ''[[prohairesis]]'') that is "in accord with nature". Because of this, the Stoics thought the best indication of an individual's philosophy was not what a person said, but how a person behaved.&lt;ref&gt;John Sellars. ''Stoicism'', 2006, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; To live a good life, one had to understand the rules of the natural order since they thought everything was rooted in nature.

Many Stoics—such as [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] and [[Epictetus]]—emphasized that because "virtue is sufficient for [[Philosophy of happiness|happiness]]", a [[Sage (philosophy)|sage]] would be emotionally resilient to misfortune. This belief is similar to the meaning of the phrase "stoic calm", though the phrase does not include the "radical ethical" Stoic views that only a sage can be considered truly free, and that all moral corruptions are equally vicious.&lt;ref name="Stoicism"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/stoicism/ Stoicism], Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Stoicism flourished throughout the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Roman Greece|Greek]] world until the 3rd century AD, and among its adherents was Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]]. It experienced a decline after Christianity became the state religion in the 4th century AD. Since then it has seen revivals, notably in the [[Renaissance philosophy|Renaissance]] ([[Neostoicism]]) and in the contemporary era ([[modern Stoicism]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Becker|first1=Lawrence C.|author-link=Lawrence C. Becker|title=A New Stoicism|date=2001|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|location=Princeton|isbn=9781400822447|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NbqFt3RPsuQC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
Stoic comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''stōïkos'', meaning "of the stoa [portico, or porch]". This, in turn, refers to the [[Stoa Poikile]], or "Painted Stoa," in Athens, where the influential Stoic [[Zeno of Citium]] taught.&lt;ref name="etymologymerriam"&gt;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/stoic&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Williamson2015"&gt;{{cite book|last=Williamson|first=D.|title=Kant's Theory of Emotion: Emotional Universalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=62WCDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA17|date=1 April 2015|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan US|isbn=978-1-137-49810-6|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In laymen's terms stoicism is sometimes referred to as "suffering in silence", and the ethics associated with that.&lt;ref&gt;Yong, Hua‐Hie. "Can attitudes of stoicism and cautiousness explain observed age‐related variation in levels of self‐rated pain, mood disturbance and functional interference in chronic pain patients?." European Journal of Pain 10.5 (2006): 399–399.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic tenets==
{{rquote|right|Philosophy does not promise to secure anything external for man, otherwise it would be admitting something that lies beyond its proper subject-matter. For as the material of the carpenter is wood, and that of statuary bronze, so the subject-matter of the art of living is each person's own life.|Epictetus|''[[Discourses of Epictetus|Discourses]]'' 1.15.2, Robin Hard revised translation}}

The Stoics provided a unified account of the world, consisting of formal [[logic]], [[monism|monistic]] [[physics]] and [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] ethics. Of these, they emphasized ethics as the main focus of human knowledge, though their logical theories were of more interest for later philosophers.

Stoicism teaches the development of self-control and fortitude as a means of overcoming destructive [[emotion]]s; the philosophy holds that becoming a clear and unbiased thinker allows one to understand the universal reason (''[[logos]]''). A primary aspect of Stoicism involves improving the individual's ethical and moral well-being: "''Virtue'' consists in a ''will'' that is in agreement with Nature."&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;Russell, Bertrand. ''A History of Western Philosophy,'' p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; This principle also applies to the realm of interpersonal relationships; "to be free from anger, envy, and jealousy,"&lt;ref name="Russell1"&gt;Russell, Bertrand. ''A History of Western Philosophy'', p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; and to accept even slaves as "equals of other men, because all men alike are products of nature".&lt;ref name="Russell5"&gt;Russell, Bertrand. ''A History of Western Philosophy'', p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stoic ethic espouses a [[determinism|deterministic]] perspective; in regard to those who lack Stoic virtue, [[Cleanthes]] once opined that the wicked man is "like a dog tied to a cart, and compelled to go wherever it goes".&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt; A Stoic of virtue, by contrast, would amend his will to suit the world and remain, in the words of Epictetus, "sick and yet happy, in peril and yet happy, dying and yet happy, in exile and happy, in disgrace and happy,"&lt;ref name="Russell1" /&gt; thus positing a "completely autonomous" individual will, and at the same time a universe that is "a rigidly deterministic single whole".  This viewpoint was later described as "[[Classical Pantheism]]" (and was adopted by Dutch philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]]).&lt;ref&gt;Charles Hartshorne and William Reese, "Philosophers Speak of God," Humanity Books, 1953 ch 4&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Antisthenes Pio-Clementino Inv288.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Antisthenes]], founder of the Cynic school of philosophy]]

Stoicism became the foremost popular philosophy among the educated elite in the Hellenistic world and the Roman Empire,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=These Were the Greeks|last=Amos|first=H.|publisher=Dufour Editions|year=1982|isbn=978-0-8023-1275-4|location=Chester Springs|oclc=9048254}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the point where, in the words of [[Gilbert Murray]] "nearly all the [[diadochi|successors of Alexander]] [...] professed themselves Stoics."&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert Murray, ''The Stoic Philosophy'' (1915), p. 25. In Bertrand Russell, ''A History of Western Philosophy'' (1946).&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning around 301&amp;nbsp;BC, [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] taught philosophy at the Stoa Poikile ("Painted Porch"), from which his philosophy got its name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Becker | first = Lawrence | title = A History of Western Ethics | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-0-415-96825-6 |page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the other schools of philosophy, such as the [[Epicureans]], Zeno chose to teach his philosophy in a public space, which was a [[colonnade]] overlooking the central gathering place of Athens, the [[Ancient Agora of Athens|Agora]].

Zeno's ideas developed from those of the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]], whose founding father, [[Antisthenes]], had been a disciple of [[Socrates]]. Zeno's most influential follower was [[Chrysippus]], who was responsible for the molding of what is now called Stoicism. Later Roman Stoics focused on promoting a life in harmony within the universe, over which one has no direct control.

[[File:Seneca-berlinantikensammlung-1.jpg|thumb|right|Bust of Seneca]] 
Scholars usually divide the history of Stoicism into three phases:
* Early Stoa, from the founding of the school by Zeno to [[Antipater of Tarsus|Antipater]].
* Middle Stoa, including [[Panaetius]] and [[Posidonius]].
* Late Stoa, including [[Gaius Musonius Rufus|Musonius Rufus]], [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[Epictetus]], and [[Marcus Aurelius]].

No complete work by any Stoic philosopher survives from the first two phases of Stoicism. Only Roman texts from the Late Stoa survive.&lt;ref&gt;A.A.Long, ''Hellenistic Philosophy'', p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logic==
{{Main|Stoic logic}}
===Propositional logic===
[[Diodorus Cronus]], who was one of Zeno's teachers, is considered the philosopher who first introduced and developed an approach to logic now known as [[propositional logic]], which is based on statements or propositions, rather than terms, making it very different from Aristotle's [[term logic]]. Later, [[Chrysippus]] developed a system that became known as Stoic logic and included a deductive system, Stoic Syllogistic, which was considered a rival to Aristotle's Syllogistic (see [[Syllogism]]). New interest in Stoic logic came in the 20th&amp;nbsp;century, when important developments in logic were based on propositional logic. [[Susanne Bobzien]] wrote, "The many close similarities between Chrysippus' philosophical logic and that of [[Gottlob Frege]] are especially striking."&lt;ref name=SEP&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-ancient/ ''Ancient Logic''] by [[Susanne Bobzien]]. Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bobzien also notes that "Chrysippus wrote over 300 books on logic, on virtually any topic logic today concerns itself with, including [[speech act]] theory, sentence analysis, singular and plural expressions, types of [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]], [[Indexicality|indexicals]], [[Existential quantification|existential propositions]], [[Logical connective|sentential connectives]], [[negation]]s, [[Logical disjunction|disjunctions]], [[Conditional proof|conditionals]], [[logical consequence]], [[validity (logic)|valid argument]] forms, [[Deductive reasoning|theory of deduction]], propositional logic, [[modal logic]], [[tense logic]], [[epistemic logic]], [[Supposition theory|logic of suppositions]], [[Imperative logic|logic of imperatives]], ambiguity and logical [[paradox]]es."&lt;ref name=SEP/&gt;

===Categories===
{{Main article|Stoic categories}}

The Stoics held that all [[being]] (ὄντα) – though not all things (τινά) – is [[Matter|material]]. They accepted the distinction between [[Abstract and concrete]] bodies, but rejected [[Aristotle]]'s belief that purely [[incorporeality|incorporeal]] being exists. Thus, they accepted [[Anaxagoras]]' idea (as did Aristotle) that if an object is hot, it is because some part of a universal heat body had entered the object. But, unlike Aristotle, they extended the idea to cover all [[Accident (philosophy)|accidents]]. Thus if an object is red, it would be because some part of a universal red body had entered the object.

They held that there were four [[Stoic categories|categories]].
* '''[[Substance theory|substance]] (ὑποκείμενον)'''
::The primary matter, formless substance, (''ousia'') that things are made of
* '''[[Quality (philosophy)|quality]] (ποιόν)'''
::The way matter is organized to form an individual object; in Stoic physics, a physical ingredient (''pneuma'': air or breath), which informs the matter
*'''somehow disposed (πως ἔχον)'''
::Particular characteristics, not present within the object, such as size, shape, action, and posture{{Rquote|right|Make for yourself a definition or description of the thing which is presented to you, so as to see distinctly what kind of a thing it is in its substance, in its nudity, in its complete entirety, and tell yourself its proper name, and the names of the things of which it has been compounded, and into which it will be resolved. For nothing is so productive of elevation of mind as to be able to examine methodically and truly every object that is presented to you in life, and always to look at things so as to see at the same time what kind of universe this is, and what kind of use everything performs in it, and what value everything has with reference to the whole.|Marcus Aurelius|''[[Meditations]]'', iii. 11}}
*'''Somehow disposed in relation to something (πρός τί πως ἔχον)'''
::Characteristics related to other phenomena, such as the position of an object within time and space relative to other objects

===Epistemology===
The Stoics propounded that [[knowledge]] can be attained through the use of [[reason]]. [[Truth]] can be distinguished from [[fallacy]]—even if, in practice, only an approximation can be made. According to the Stoics, the [[sense]]s constantly receive sensations: pulsations that pass from objects through the senses to the [[mind]], where they leave an impression in the [[imagination]] (phantasia) (an impression arising from the mind was called a phantasma).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Diogenes Laërtius | author-link = Diogenes Laërtius | year = 2000 | title = Lives of eminent philosophers | publisher = [[Harvard University Press]] | location = Cambridge, MA}} VII.49&lt;/ref&gt;

The mind has the ability to judge (συγκατάθεσις, ''synkatathesis'')—approve or reject—an impression, enabling it to distinguish a true representation of reality from one that is false. Some impressions can be assented to immediately, but others can only achieve varying degrees of hesitant approval, which can be labeled [[belief]] or opinion (''[[doxa]]''). It is only through reason that we gain clear comprehension and conviction (''[[katalepsis]]''). [[Certain]] and true knowledge (''[[episteme]]''), achievable by the Stoic sage, can be attained only by verifying the conviction with the expertise of one's peers and the collective judgment of humankind.

==Metaphysics==
The first philosophers to explicitly describe [[Nominalism|nominalist]] arguments were the Stoics, especially Chrysippus.&lt;ref&gt;John Sellars, ''Stoicism'', Routledge, 2014, pp. 84–85: "[Stoics] have often been presented as the first nominalists, rejecting the existence of universal concepts altogether. ... For Chrysippus there are no universal entities, whether they be conceived as substantial [[Platonic Forms]] or in some other manner.".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iep.utm.edu/chrysipp/ Chrysippus – Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physics, theology and cosmology==
{{main article|Stoic physics}}
{{See also|De Mundo}}
According to the Stoics, the [[Universe]] is a material, reasoning substance, known as God or [[Nature]], which the Stoics divided into two classes, the active and the passive. The passive substance is matter, which "lies sluggish, a substance ready for any use, but sure to remain unemployed if no one sets it in motion".&lt;ref&gt;Seneca, ''Epistles'', lxv. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The active substance, which can be called [[Destiny|Fate]] or Universal Reason (''Logos''), is an intelligent [[Aether (classical element)|aether]] or primordial fire, which acts on the passive matter:
{{quote|The universe itself is God and the universal outpouring of its soul; it is this same world's guiding principle, operating in mind and reason, together with the common nature of things and the totality that embraces all existence; then the foreordained might and necessity of the future; then fire and the principle of aether; then those elements whose natural state is one of flux and transition, such as water, earth, and air; then the sun, the moon, the stars; and the universal existence in which all things are contained.|sign=Chrysippus|source=in Cicero, ''[[De Natura Deorum]]'', i. 39}}

Everything is subject to the laws of Fate, for the Universe acts according to its own nature, and the nature of the passive matter it governs. The [[soul]]s of humans and animals are emanations from this primordial Fire, and are, likewise, subject to Fate:

{{quote|Constantly regard the universe as one living being, having one substance and one soul; and observe how all things have reference to one perception, the perception of this one living being; and how all things act with one movement; and how all things are the cooperating causes of all things that exist; observe too the continuous spinning of the thread and the structure of the web.|sign=Marcus Aurelius|source=''[[Meditations]]'', iv. 40}}

Individual souls are perishable by nature, and can be "transmuted and diffused, assuming a fiery nature by being received into the ''seminal reason'' ("[[logos spermatikos]]") of the Universe".&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Aurelius, ''Meditations'', iv. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Since right Reason is the foundation of both humanity and the universe, it follows that the goal of life is to live according to Reason, that is, to live a life according to [[Natural law|Nature]].

Stoic theology is a [[Fatalism|fatalistic]] and [[naturalistic pantheism]]: God is never fully transcendent but always [[Immanence|immanent]], and identified with [[Nature]]. [[Abrahamic religions]] personalize God as a world-creating entity, but Stoicism equates God with the totality of the universe; according to Stoic [[cosmology]], which is very similar to the [[Hindu cosmology|Hindu conception of existence]], there is no absolute start to time, as it is considered infinite and cyclic. Similarly, the [[space]] and [[Universe]] have neither start nor end, rather they are cyclical. The current Universe is a phase in the present cycle, preceded by an infinite number of Universes, doomed to be destroyed ("[[Ekpyrosis|ekpyrōsis]]", ''conflagration'') and [[Palingenesis|re-created again]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Lapidge]], ''Stoic Cosmology'', in: John M. Rist, ''The Stoics'', [[Cambridge University Press]], 1978, pp. 182–183.&lt;/ref&gt; and to be followed by another infinite number of Universes. Stoicism considers all [[existence]] as cyclic, the cosmos as eternally self-creating and self-destroying (see also [[Eternal return]]).

Stoicism, just like [[Indian religions]] such as [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]], does not posit a beginning or end to the Universe.&lt;ref name="ferg" /&gt; According to the Stoics, the ''[[logos]]'' was the active [[reason]] or ''[[anima mundi]]'' pervading and animating the entire Universe. It was conceived as material and is usually identified with God or Nature. The Stoics also referred to the ''seminal reason'' ("[[logos spermatikos]]"), or the law of generation in the Universe, which was the principle of the active reason working in inanimate [[matter]]. Humans, too, each possess a portion of the divine ''logos'', which is the primordial Fire and reason that controls and sustains the Universe.&lt;ref&gt;Tripolitis, A., ''Religions of the Hellenistic-Roman Age'', pp. 37–38. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics and virtues&lt;!--linked from 'Zeno of Citium' and 'Oikeiôsis'--&gt;==
The ancient Stoics are often misunderstood because the terms they used pertained to different concepts in the past than they do today. The word "stoic" has come to mean "unemotional" or indifferent to pain because Stoic ethics taught freedom from "passion" by following "reason". The Stoics did not seek to extinguish emotions; rather, they sought to transform them by a resolute "[[asceticism|askēsis]]" that enables a person to develop clear judgment and inner calm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Graver | first = Margaret | title = Stoicism and Emotion | publisher = [[University of Chicago Press]] | location = Chicago | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-0-226-30558-5 |oclc=430497127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Logic, reflection, and concentration were the methods of such self-discipline.

Borrowing from the Cynics, the foundation of Stoic ethics is that good lies in the state of the soul itself; in wisdom and self-control. Stoic ethics stressed the rule: "Follow where reason leads." {{citationneeded|date=June 2017}} One must therefore strive to be free of the [[Stoic passions|passions]], bearing in mind that the ancient meaning of "passion" was "anguish" or "suffering",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/passion |website=[[Merriam-Webster]] |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |title=Passion |accessdate=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is, "passively" reacting to external events, which is somewhat different from the modern use of the word. A distinction was made between ''pathos'' (plural ''pathe'') which is normally translated as ''passion'', ''propathos'' or instinctive reaction (e.g., turning pale and trembling when confronted by physical danger) and ''eupathos'', which is the mark of the Stoic sage (''sophos''). The ''eupatheia'' are feelings that result from correct judgment in the same way that passions result from incorrect judgment.

The idea was to be free of [[suffering]] through ''[[apatheia]]'' (Greek: {{lang|grc|ἀπάθεια}}; literally, "without passion") or [[Inner peace|peace of mind]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Seddon | first = Keith | title = Epictetus' Handbook and the Tablet of Cebes | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-0-415-32451-9 |page=217 |oclc=469313282}}&lt;/ref&gt; where peace of mind was understood in the ancient sense—being [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] or having "clear judgment" and the maintenance of [[equanimity]] in the face of life's highs and lows.

For the Stoics, reason meant not only using logic, but also understanding the processes of nature—the logos or universal reason, inherent in all things. Living according to reason and virtue, they held, is to live in harmony with the divine order of the universe, in recognition of the common reason and essential value of all people.

The four [[cardinal virtues]] (''[[Arete (moral virtue)|aretai]]'') of Stoic philosophy is a classification derived from the teachings of [[Plato]] (''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' IV. 426–435):
* [[Wisdom]] (σοφία "''sophia''")
* [[Courage]] (ανδρεία "''andreia''")
* [[Justice]] (δικαιοσύνη "''dikaiosyne''")
* [[Temperance (virtue)|Temperance]] (σωφροσύνη ''"[[sophrosyne]]''")

Following Socrates, the Stoics held that unhappiness and [[evil]] are the results of human ignorance of the reason in nature. If someone is unkind, it is because they are unaware of their own universal reason, which leads to the conclusion of unkindness. The solution to evil and unhappiness then is the practice of Stoic philosophy: to examine one's own judgments and behavior and determine where they diverge from the universal reason of nature.

The Stoics accepted that suicide was permissible for the wise person in circumstances that might prevent them from living a virtuous life.&lt;ref name="marietta153"&gt;Don E. Marietta, (1998), ''Introduction to ancient philosophy'', pp. 153–54. Sharpe&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plutarch]] held that accepting life under tyranny would have compromised [[Cato the Younger|Cato]]'s self-consistency (''constantia'') as a Stoic and impaired his freedom to make the honorable moral choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Cato's suicide in Plutarch AV Zadorojnyi|publisher=The Classical Quarterly|year=2007|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0009838807000195|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

===The doctrine of "things indifferent"===
{{main article|Apatheia}}
{{see also|Eudaimonia}}
In philosophical terms, things that are indifferent are outside the application of [[Moral absolutism|moral law]]—that is without tendency to either promote or obstruct moral ends. Actions neither required nor forbidden by the moral law, or that do not affect [[morality]], are called morally indifferent. The doctrine of things indifferent ({{lang|grc|ἀδιάφορα}}, ''[[adiaphora]]'') arose in the Stoic school as a [[corollary]] of its diametric opposition of virtue and vice ({{lang|grc|καθήκοντα}} ''[[kathekon]]'', "convenient actions", or actions in accordance with nature; and ἁμαρτήματα ''hamartemata'', mistakes). As a result of this [[dichotomy]], a large class of objects were left unassigned and thus regarded as indifferent.

Eventually three sub-classes of "things indifferent" developed: things to prefer because they assist life according to nature; things to avoid because they hinder it; and things indifferent in the narrower sense. The principle of ''adiaphora'' was also common to the Cynics. [[Philipp Melanchthon]] revived the doctrine of things indifferent during the [[Renaissance]].

===Spiritual exercise===
[[File:L'Image et le Pouvoir - Buste cuirassé de Marc Aurèle agé - 3.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Marcus Aurelius]], the Stoic Roman emperor]]
Philosophy for a Stoic is not just a set of beliefs or ethical claims, it is a way of life involving constant practice and training (or "[[asceticism|askēsis]]"). Stoic philosophical and spiritual practices included [[History of logic#Stoics|logic]], [[Socratic dialogue]] and [[Introspection|self-dialogue]], [[Mortality salience|contemplation of death]], training attention to remain in the present moment (similar to some forms of [[Buddhist meditation]]), and daily reflection on everyday problems and possible solutions. Philosophy for a Stoic is an active process of constant practice and self-reminder.

In his ''[[Meditations]]'', Marcus Aurelius defines several such practices. For example, in Book II.I:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Say to yourself in the early morning: I shall meet today ungrateful, violent, treacherous, envious, uncharitable men. All of the ignorance of real good and ill... I can neither be harmed by any of them, for no man will involve me in wrong, nor can I be angry with my kinsman or hate him; for we have come into the world to work together...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Prior to Aurelius, Epictetus in his ''[[Discourses of Epictetus|Discourses]],'' distinguished between three types of act: judgment, desire, and inclination.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, A.I. (1995) ''Pierre Hadot and the Spiritual Phenomenon of Ancient Philosophy'', in ''Philosophy as a Way of Life'', Hadot, P. Oxford Blackwells, pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt; According to French philosopher [[Pierre Hadot]], Epictetus identifies these three acts with logic, physics and ethics respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Hadot, P. (1992) ''La Citadelle intérieure. Introduction aux Pensées de Marc Aurèle''. Paris, Fayard, pp. 106–15&lt;/ref&gt; Hadot writes that in the ''Meditations'', "Each maxim develops either one of these very characteristic ''topoi'' [i.e., acts], or two of them or three of them."&lt;ref&gt;Hadot, P. (1987) ''Exercices spirituels et philosophie antique''. Paris, 2nd ed., p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seamus Mac Suibhne has described the practices of spiritual exercises as influencing those of [[reflective practice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mac Suibhne, S.|year=2009|title='Wrestle to be the man philosophy wished to make you': Marcus Aurelius, reflective practitioner|journal=Reflective Practice|volume=10|issue=4|pages=429–36|doi=10.1080/14623940903138266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robertson's ''The Philosophy of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy'' details at length parallels between Stoic spiritual exercises and modern [[cognitive behavioral therapy]].&lt;ref name="Robertson_2010"&gt;{{Cite book| author=Robertson, D | title=The Philosophy of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy: Stoicism as Rational and Cognitive Psychotherapy| year=2010| publisher=Karnac| location=London| isbn=978-1-85575-756-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XsOFyJaR5vEC&amp;lpg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stoics were also known for consolatory orations, which were part of the ''[[consolatio]]'' literary tradition.  Three such [[Seneca's Consolations|consolations]] by Seneca have survived.

==Social philosophy==
A distinctive feature of Stoicism is its [[cosmopolitanism]]: All people are manifestations of the one universal spirit and should live in brotherly love and readily help one another according to the Stoics. In the ''[[Discourses of Epictetus|Discourses]]'', [[Epictetus]] comments on man's relationship with the world: "Each human being is primarily a citizen of his own commonwealth; but he is also a member of the great city of gods and men, whereof the city political is only a copy."&lt;ref&gt;Epictetus, ''Discourses'', ii. 5. 26&lt;/ref&gt; This sentiment echoes that of [[Diogenes of Sinope]], who said, "I am not an [[Athens, Greece|Athenian]] or a [[Ancient Corinth|Corinthian]], but a citizen of the world."&lt;ref&gt;Epictetus, ''Discourses'', i. 9. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

They held that external differences such as rank and wealth are of no importance in social relationships. Instead, they advocated the brotherhood of humanity and the natural equality of all human beings. Stoicism became the most influential school of the Greco-Roman world, and produced a number of remarkable writers and personalities, such as [[Cato the Younger]] and Epictetus.

In particular, they were noted for their urging of [[clemency]] toward [[slave]]s. Seneca exhorted, "Kindly remember that he whom you call your slave sprang from the same stock, is smiled upon by the same skies, and on equal terms with yourself breathes, lives, and dies."&lt;ref&gt;[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[s:Moral letters to Lucilius/Letter 47|''Moral letters to Lucilius'', Letter 47: ''On master and slave'']], 10, circa AD 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on Christianity==
{{See also|Neostoicism}}
[[Image:Justus Lipsius.png|right|thumb|[[Justus Lipsius]], founder of Neostoicism]]
In his introduction to the 1964 [[Penguin Classics]] edition of ''Meditations'', the Anglican priest Maxwell Staniforth discussed the profound impact Stoicism had on Christianity. He claimed the author of the Fourth Gospel declared Christ to be the Logos, which "had long been one of the leading terms of Stoicism, chosen originally for the purpose of explaining how deity came into relation with the universe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marcus Aurelius |authorlink=Marcus Aurelius| title=Meditations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WV7Teosv0bIC |year=1964 |location=London |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |page=24 |isbn=978-0-140-44140-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In St. Ambrose of Milan's ''Duties'', "The voice is the voice of a Christian bishop, but the precepts are those of [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3401.htm|title=On the Duties of the Clergy|website=www.newadvent.org|access-date=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aurelius |first=Marcus |authorlink=Marcus Aurelius| title=Meditations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WV7Teosv0bIC |year=1964 |location=London |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |page=26 |isbn=978-0-140-44140-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding what he called "the Divine Spirit", Stanisforth wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Cleanthes, wishing to give more explicit meaning to Zeno's 'creative fire', had been the first to hit upon the term ''pneuma'', or 'spirit', to describe it. Like fire, this intelligent 'spirit' was imagined as a tenuous substance akin to a current of air or breath, but essentially possessing the quality of warmth; it was immanent in the universe as God, and in man as the soul and life-giving principle. Clearly it is not a long step from this to the 'Holy Spirit' of Christian theology, the 'Lord and Giver of life', visibly manifested as tongues of fire at Pentecost and ever since associated—in the Christian as in the Stoic mind—with the ideas of vital fire and beneficient warmth.&lt;ref name="Marcus Aurelius 1964 25"&gt;{{cite book |last=Marcus Aurelius |authorlink=Marcus Aurelius| title=Meditations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WV7Teosv0bIC |year=1964 |location=London |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |page=25 |isbn=978-0-140-44140-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Regarding the [[Trinity]], Staniforth wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Again in the doctrine of the Trinity, the ecclesiastical conception of Father, Word, and Spirit finds its germ in the different Stoic names of the Divine Unity. Thus Seneca, writing of the supreme Power which shapes the universe, states, 'This Power we sometimes call the All-ruling God, sometimes the incorporeal Wisdom, sometimes the holy Spirit, sometimes Destiny.' The Church had only to reject the last of these terms to arrive at its own acceptable definition of the Divine Nature; while the further assertion 'these three are One', which the modern mind finds paradoxical, was no more than commonplace to those familiar with Stoic notions.&lt;ref name="Marcus Aurelius 1964 25"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Paul of Tarsus|apostle Paul]] met with Stoics during his stay in Athens, reported in {{bibleverse||Acts|17:16–18|NKJV}}. In his [[Pauline epistles|letters]], Paul reflected heavily from his knowledge of Stoic philosophy, using Stoic terms and metaphors to assist his new [[Gentile]] converts in their understanding of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Kee, Howard and Franklin W. Young, ''Understanding The New Testament'', Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, Prentice Hall, Inc. 1958, p. 208. {{ISBN|978-0139365911}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stoic influence can also be seen in the works of [[St. Ambrose]], [[Marcus Minucius Felix]], and [[Tertullian]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/topic/Stoicism Encyclopædia Britannica. Stoicism. §''Stoic elements in Pauline and patristic thought'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Fathers of the Church]] regarded Stoicism as a "pagan philosophy";&lt;ref name="Agathias"&gt;[[Agathias]]. ''Histories,'' 2.31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sedley"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=David |first=Sedley |editor=E. Craig |encyclopedia=[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |title=Ancient philosophy |url=http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/A130 |accessdate=2008-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; nonetheless, early Christian writers employed some of the central philosophical concepts of Stoicism. Examples include the terms "logos", "[[virtue]]", "[[Spirit]]", and "[[conscience]]".&lt;ref name="ferg"&gt;Ferguson, Everett. ''Backgrounds of Early Christianity''. 2003, p. 368.&lt;/ref&gt; But the parallels go well beyond the sharing and borrowing of terminology. Both Stoicism and Christianity assert an inner freedom in the face of the external world, a belief in human kinship with Nature or God, a sense of the innate depravity—or "persistent evil"—of humankind,&lt;ref name="ferg" /&gt; and the futility and temporary nature of worldly possessions and attachments. Both encourage ''Ascesis'' with respect to the passions and inferior emotions such as lust, and envy, so that the higher possibilities of one's humanity can be awakened and developed.

Stoic writings such as ''[[Meditations]]'' by [[Marcus Aurelius]] have been highly regarded by many Christians throughout the centuries. The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and [[Oriental Orthodox Church]] accept the Stoic ideal of [[Apatheia|dispassion]] to this day.

==Modern usage==
The word "stoic" commonly refers to someone indifferent to pain, pleasure, grief, or joy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://buildthefire.com/modern-stoicism/|title=Modern Stoicism {{!}} Build The Fire|date=9 February 2016|website=Build The Fire|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern usage as "person who represses feelings or endures patiently" was first cited in 1579 as a [[noun]], and 1596 as an [[adjective]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=stoic |title=Online Etymology Dictionary&amp;nbsp;– Stoic |accessdate=2006-09-02|last=Harper |first=Douglas |date=November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the term "[[Epicureanism|Epicurean]]", the ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy's'' entry on Stoicism notes, "the sense of the English adjective 'stoical' is not utterly misleading with regard to its philosophical origins."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/stoicism/ |title=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&amp;nbsp;– Stoicism |accessdate=2006-09-02 |last=Baltzly |first=Dirk |date=13 December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Swami Vivekananda 1893 Scanned Image.jpg|thumb|Swami Vivekananda &amp;ndash; his teachings and philosophy stressed on different aspects of religion, youth, education, faith, character building as well as social issues pertaining to India."]]

Swami Vivekananda was a [[Hindu]] monk from India. He played significant role in the growing Indian nationalism of the 19th and 20th century, reinterpreting and harmonising certain aspects of Hinduism. His '''teachings and philosophy''' applied this reinterpretation to various aspects of education, faith, character building as well as social issues pertaining to [[India]], and was also instrumental in introducing Yoga to the west.

According to Vivekananda a country's future depends on its people, stating that "man-making is my mission."&lt;ref name="My India India Eternal"&gt;{{cite book|last=Vivekananda|first=Swami|title=My India: the India eternal|year=1996|publisher=Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture|location=Calcutta|isbn=81-85843-51-1|pages=1–2|edition=1st|editor=Swami Lokeswarananda}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religion plays a central role in this man-making, stating "to preach unto mankind their divinity, and how to make it manifest in every movement of life."&lt;ref name="Swami Vivekananda: Life and Teachings, Belur Math"&gt;{{cite|title=Swami Vivekananda: Life and Teachings|url=http://www.belurmath.org/swamivivekananda.htm|publisher=Belur Math|accessdate=30 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330175816/http://www.belurmath.org/swamivivekananda.htm|archivedate=30 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indian nationalism==
Vivekananda played a major role in the growing Indian nationalism in the late 19th and the 20th century, encouraging many Indians with his success and appeal in the west. His example helped to build pride in India's cultural and religious heritage, and to stand up against the British colonial system.

Swami Vivekananda believed that India is the blessed ''punyabhumi'', the "land of virtue":

{{quote|".. the land where humanity has attained its highest towards generosity, towards purity, towards calmness, above all, the land of introspection and of spirituality - it is [[India]]. "&lt;ref name="Vivekananda’s Lankan connection"&gt;{{cite web|title=Vivekananda’s Lankan connection|url=http://dailypioneer.com/sunday-edition/sundayagenda/spirituality-agenda/38428-vivekanandas-lankan-connection.html|accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
According to Swami Vivekananda it is coordinated willpower that leads to independence. He gave the British colonial system as an example, with forty millions of Englishmen ruling three hundred millions of people in [[India]]. According to Vivekananda, the forty millions put their wills together and that resulted infinite power, and that was the reason of their success. Vivekananda prescribed, to make a great future [[India]] the whole serest will lie in organization, accumulation of power, co-ordination of wills.&lt;ref name="The future of India RKV"&gt;{{cite web|title=The future of India|url=http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info/vivekananda/volume_3/lectures_from_colombo_to_almora/the_future_of_india.htm|work=ramakrishnavivekananda.info|accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Vivekananda the Indian race never cared about physical wealth, although they acquired immense wealth.&lt;ref name="My life and mission RKVI CW"&gt;{{cite web|title=My life and mission|url=http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info/vivekananda/volume_8/lectures_and_discourses/my_life_and_mission.htm|work=ramakrishnavivekananda.info|accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
Religion played a major role in Vivekananda's ideas. To Vivekananda religion was not only talk or doctrine or theory, but realization of the best and strongest powers within oneself. He said, 
{{quote|[I]t is being and becoming, not hearing or acknowledging; it is the whole soul becoming changed into what it believes."&lt;ref name="Swami Vivekananda: Life and Teachings, Belur Math" /&gt; He also felt religion is the gist of all worship is to be pure and to do good to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Universal teachings of Swami Vivekananda|url=http://www.ramakrishna.org/ut_sv.htm|work=ramakrishna.org|accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Swami Vivekananda, religion is the idea which is raising the brute into man, and man into God.&lt;ref name="Swami Vivekananda Sayings AB"&gt;{{cite web|title=Swami Vivekananda Sayings|url=http://www.abuddhistlibrary.com/Buddhism/H%20-%20World%20Religions%20and%20Poetry/World%20Religions/From%20the%20Indian%20Tradition/Teachers%20from%20the%20Indian%20Tradition/Swami%20Vivekananda/Sayings/Sayings%20of%20Swami%20Vivekananda%20-%20The%20Holy%20Trinity%20-%20%5B%20RMIC%20%5D.htm|work=abuddhistlibrary.com|accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ramakrishna===
Vivekananda was deeply influenced by the [[Brahmo Samaj]], and by his guru [[Ramakrishna]], who regarded the Absolute and the relative reality to be nondual aspects of the same integral reality. According to Michael Taft, Ramakrishna reconciled the dualism of form and formless,{{sfn|Taft|2014}} regarding the Supreme Being to be both Personal and Impersonal, active and inactive. Ramakrishna &lt;blockquote&gt;The Personal and Impersonal are the same thing, like milk and its whiteness, the diamond and its lustre, the snake and its wriggling motion. It is impossible to conceive of the one without the other. The Divine Mother and Brahman are one.&lt;ref name="GM"&gt;{{cite web |title=Sri Ramakrisha The Great Master, by Swami Saradananda, (tr.)

Swami Vivekananda (12 January 1863 – 4 July 1902), born Narendranath Datta, was an [[India]]n [[Hindu]] [[monk]], a chief disciple of the 19th-century Indian mystic [[Ramakrishna]]. &lt;sup&gt;[[Swami Vivekananda#cite note-4|[4]]][[Swami Vivekananda#cite note-5|[5]]]&lt;/sup&gt; He was a key figure in the introduction of the Indian philosophies of [[Vedanta]] and [[Yoga]] to the Western world&lt;sup&gt;[[Swami Vivekananda#cite note-6|[6]]][[Swami Vivekananda#cite note-FOOTNOTEGeorg2002600-7|[7]]]&lt;/sup&gt; and is credited with raising [[Interfaith dialogue|interfaith]] awareness, bringing [[Hinduism]] to the status of a major world religion during the late 19th century.&lt;sup&gt;[[Swami Vivekananda#cite note-FOOTNOTEClarke2006209-8|[8]]]&lt;/sup&gt; He was a major force in the [[Hindu reform movements|revival of Hinduism]] in India, and contributed to the concept of [[nationalism]] in [[colonial India]].&lt;sup&gt;[[Swami Vivekananda#cite note-FOOTNOTEVon Dense1999191-9|[9]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Vivekananda founded the [[Ramakrishna Math]] and the [[Ramakrishna Mission]].&lt;sup&gt;[[Swami Vivekananda#cite note-FOOTNOTEGeorg2002600-7|[7]]]&lt;/sup&gt; He is perhaps best known for his speech which began, "Sisters and brothers of America ...,"&lt;sup&gt;[[Swami Vivekananda#cite note-FOOTNOTEDutt2005121-10|[10]]]&lt;/sup&gt; in which he introduced Hinduism at the [[Parliament of the World's Religions]] in [[Chicago]] in 1893.

Born into an aristocratic [[Bengali people|Bengali]] family of [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], Vivekananda was inclined towards spirituality. He was influenced by his [[guru]], Ramakrishna, from whom he learnt that all living beings were an embodiment of the divine self; therefore, service to God could be rendered by service to mankind. After Ramakrishna's death, Vivekananda toured the [[Indian subcontinent]] extensively and acquired first-hand knowledge of the conditions prevailing in [[British India]]. He later travelled to the United States, representing India at the 1893 Parliament of the World's Religions. Vivekananda conducted hundreds of public and private lectures and classes, disseminating tenets of [[Hindu philosophy]] in the United States, England and Europe. In India, Vivekananda is regarded as a [[List of Hindu gurus and saints|patriotic saint]] and his birthday is celebrated there as [[National Youth Day (India)|National Youth Day]].

He belonged to a traditional family and was one of nine siblings.  His mother, Bhubaneswari Devi, was a devout housewife. The progressive, rational attitude of Narendra's father and the religious temperament of his mother helped shape his thinking and personality.

In 1880 Narendra joined [[Keshab Chandra Sen]]'s [[Nava Vidhan]], which was established by Sen after meeting [[Ramakrishna]] and reconverting from Christianity to Hinduism. The same search for direct intuition and understanding can be seen with Vivekananda. Not satisfied with his knowledge of philosophy, Narendra came to "the question which marked the real beginning of his intellectual quest for God."&lt;sup&gt;[[Swami Vivekananda#cite note-FOOTNOTEBanhatti19958-39|[39]]]&lt;/sup&gt; He asked several prominent Calcutta residents if they had come "face to face with God", but none of their answers satisfied him.&lt;sup&gt;[[Swami Vivekananda#cite note-FOOTNOTESen200612–13-49|[49]]][[Swami Vivekananda#cite note-FOOTNOTEPangbornSmith1976106-31|[31]]]&lt;/sup&gt; At this time, Narendra met Debendranath Tagore (the leader of Brahmo Samaj) and asked if he had seen God. Instead of answering his question, Tagore said "My boy, you have the [[Yogi]]'s eyes."&lt;sup&gt;[[Swami Vivekananda#cite note-FOOTNOTEBanhatti19958-39|[39]]][[Swami Vivekananda#cite note-FOOTNOTEChattopadhyaya199931-36|[36]]]&lt;/sup&gt; According to Banhatti, it was Ramakrishna who really answered Narendra's question, by saying "Yes, I see Him as I see you, only in an infinitely intenser sense."&lt;sup&gt;[[Swami Vivekananda#cite note-FOOTNOTEBanhatti19958-39|[39]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Nevertheless, Vivekananda was more influenced by the Brahmo Samaj's and its new ideas, than by Ramakrishna.&lt;sup&gt;[[Swami Vivekananda#cite note-FOOTNOTEMichelis200549-48|[48]]]&lt;/sup&gt; It was Sen's influence who brought Vivekananda fully into contact with western esotericism, and it was also via Sen that he met Ramakrishna.

In 1881 Narendra first met Ramakrishna, who became his spiritual focus after his own father had died in 1884. Narendra's first introduction to Ramakrishna occurred in a literature class at General Assembly's Institution when he heard Professor William Hastie lecturing on [[William Wordsworth]]'s poem, [[The Excursion]]. While explaining the word "trance" in the poem, Hastie suggested that his students visit Ramakrishna of [[Dakshineswar]] to understand the true meaning of trance. This prompted some of his students (including Narendra) to visit Ramakrishna.

According to Banhatti, "[a] singer, a painter, a wonderful master of language and a poet, Vivekananda was a complete artist",&lt;sup&gt;[[Swami Vivekananda#cite note-FOOTNOTEBanhatti1963273-203|[195]]]&lt;/sup&gt; composing many songs and poems, including his favourite, "[[Kali the Mother (poem)|Kali the Mother]]". Vivekananda blended humour with his teachings, and his language was lucid. His Bengali writings testify to his belief that words (spoken or written) should clarify ideas, rather than demonstrating the speaker (or writer's) knowledge.

=== UNIVERSITIES ===

Born on 12 January 1863 at Calcutta in the West Bengal, Vivekananda was the son of Viswanath Datta and Bhubaneswari Devi. His mother became his first teacher and taught her English and Bengali. Vivekananda listened from his mother the stories of Ramayana and Mahabharata. Being attached with the educational institutions like the Presidency College and General Assembly’s institution, he passed B.A. and became a member of the Brahmo Samaj. His curiosity increased on the question of the existence of God and he asked one question to all whom, he met – “Have you seen God?” At last he met Rama Krishna Parmahamsa, a priest of the Dakshineswar Kali temple and accepted him as his Guru. He was known then Vivekananda. His address in the parliament of Religions at Chicago as “Sisters and Brothers of America” astonished all. He visited different parts of Europe and many foreigners including sister Nivedita became his disciple. Later on Vivekananda established Ramakrishna Mission on social, religious and cultural foundation. He wrote several books like ‘Jnanayoga’, ‘Bhaktiyoga’, ‘Rajayoga’, ‘To the youth of India’ etc. His divinity was greatly feel by the Indians through his speech and works. He breathed his last in 1902.

=== Reforms ===

=== Hinduism-Universal Religion ===
Vivekananda considered Hinduism to be the mother of all religions. He established through historical sequence. He showed that Vedic religion had influenced Buddhism which again was instrumental in influencing Christianity. He told that all the religions of the world have the same value and importance. In the Parliament of Religions he told—&lt;blockquote&gt;” …The Christian is not to become a Hindu or a Buddhist, nor a Hindu or a Buddhist to become a Christian. But each must assimilate the spirit of the others and yet preserve his individuality and grow according to his own law of growth ….Upon the banner of every religion soon be written … ‘Help and not fight’,‘Assimilation and not Destruction’,‘Harmony, and peace and not Dissension.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Thus, through his universal religion, Vivekananda preached the unity of God. He told that though the paths are different for different religions but the goal is same. He attached great importance to the unity of all religions and their fusion into one universal religion.

=== Advaita Vedantism ===
Swami Vivekananda was a great lover of Vedantic philosophy. He believed in monism. He had firm faith on one God. His motto, as reflected earlier, was to establish a link among different religions. He had told that as water of different rivers mingle in the sea, similarly every religion finds itself at the feet of God. He did not see any difference between a Veda or Koran or Bible. Temple, Mosque and Church were equal for him.

He preferred to meditate at any place without any inhibition in his mind. By his personal example he preached monism or Advaita Vedantism. By that he showed his toleration towards every religion. He spoke the message of Vedanta regarding the world unity and to believe shapeless God.

=== Caste System ===
A striking contrast was noticed in the idea of Vivekananda regarding the caste system. Strangely enough, he supported the Varna system as described in the Vedas. Unfolding the advantages of the caste system, he told that division of labour is a great blessing of this system. It would lead to excellence in any profession.

This division, of course, will lead to a caste on the path of progress. However, he also exposed the evils of this system. Untouchability was its worst part. So, Vivekananda criticized this type of “Don’t touches”. He wanted to curb out this type of dogmatism from the society.

=== Estimate ===
Of course, Vivekananda was criticized for his idea regarding the caste system. His idea of internationalism was regarded as a platonic utopia. However, criticisms are only for criticisms sake. Swami Vivekananda’s constituent endeavor to free religion from superstitions really establishes him as a great reformer. His synthesis of the materialism and spiritualism is another remarkable feature of his philosophical thought. Thus, he was a great spiritual, nationalist, internationalist and so on.

Renaissance and reformation were the two peas of Vivekananda’s personality. He really brought a reawakening of the Indian culture. By his sharp intellect and reformative attitude he made Hinduism a progressive force in the world. A rare gem he was in the treasure of Indian wisdom. Undoubtedly he dazzled as a shining star in the cultural horizon of India and attracted the attention of the people of the world.

Swami Vivekananda compared human mind with a monkey who is always restless and incessantly active by his own nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The mind is like a monkey|url=http://www.psychokhemia.com/learn/treasures/020-vivekananda-monkey-mind.html|work=psychokhemia.com|accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He noticed, the human mind naturally wants to get outside, to peer out of the body, as it were, through the channels of the organs.&lt;ref name="The Cosmons- The Microcosm"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Cosmons- The Microcosm|url=http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info/vivekananda/volume_2/jnana-yoga/the_microcosm.htm|work=ramakrishnavivekananda.info|accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; So, he stressed on practice of concentration,&lt;ref name="Concentration, its practice"&gt;{{cite web|title=Concentration, its practice|url=http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info/vivekananda/volume_1/raja-yoga/concentration_its_practice.htm|work=ramakrishnavivekananda.info|accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as he felt there is no limit to the power of the human mind, the more concentrated it is, the more powerful it becomes.&lt;ref name="Why Control Mind? GR"&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Control Mind?|url=http://www.greenmesg.org/swami_vivekananda_sayings_quotes/mind-why_control_mind.php|work=greenmesg.org|accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Swami Vivekananda suggested not to do anything which disturbs the mind or makes it restless.

===Universalism===
Although embracing and propagating Universalism, he regarded Hinduism the best of all religions, and Advaita Vedanta the best of what Indian religious thought had to offer. According to Vivekananda the greatest misfortune of the world is we do not tolerate and accept other religions. In his lecture in Parliament of religions on September 15, 1893, he told a story of a frog who lived in a well for a long time, he was born there and brought up there and he used to think that nothing in the world can be bigger than that. Swami Vivekananda concluded the story: 
{{cquote|I am a Hindu. I am sitting in my own little well and thinking that the whole world is my little well. The Christian sits in his little well and thinks the whole world is his well. The Mohammedan sits in his little well and thinks that is the whole world.&lt;ref name="Why we disagree"&gt;{{cite web|title=Why we disagree|url=http://www.indianeye.org/2008/01/07/why-we-disagree-by-swami-vivekananda/|accessdate=30 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609023028/http://www.indianeye.org/2008/01/07/why-we-disagree-by-swami-vivekananda/|archivedate=9 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Vivekananda we must not only tolerate other religions, but positively embrace them, since the truth is the basis of all religions.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda/Volume 5/Epistles - First Series/XXII Alasinga]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society==

===Social service===
Social service was an essential aspect of Vivekananda's ideas, and an innovation which deviated from both Advaita Vedanta and Ramakrishna. He nevertheless attributed these ideas to both, trying to reconcile them with his own ideas.

According to Vivekananda, an important teaching he received from Ramakrishna was that ''Jiva is Shiva'' (each individual is divinity itself). So he stressed on ''Shiva Jnane Jiva Seva'', (to serve common people considering them as manifestation of God). According to Vivekananda, man is potentially Divine, so, service to man is indeed service to God.&lt;ref name="IDEOLOGY of Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission"&gt;{{cite web|title=IDEOLOGY of Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission|url=http://www.belurmath.org/Ideology.htm|work=belurmath.org|accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-injury===
Swami Vivekananda called [[Jain]] [[Digambara|monks]] the first great ascetics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://belurmath.org/complete_works_of_swami_vivekananda/volume_3/vol_3_frame.htm BUDDHISTIC INDIA Para 22-23]&lt;/ref&gt; He praised their ancient knowledge of presence of low form of life in water:&lt;ref&gt;[[s:The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda/Volume 3/Buddhistic India|BUDDHISTIC INDIA Para 24]]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|A terrible thing, killing these low forms of life. So these monks, if they died of thirst, they would never kill these animals by drinking water. How all that we call ethics they simply bring out from that one great principle of non-injury and doing good.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info/vivekananda/volume_3/buddhistic_india.htm&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Personal development==
In line with the influence of western ideas, Vivekananda stressed the importance of individual development.

===Character building===
Swami Vivekananda realized three things are necessary to make every man great, every nation great:&lt;ref name="Swami Vivekananda Ebook Q"&gt;{{cite web|title=Swami Vivekananda Ebook|url=http://www.consciouslivingfoundation.org/ebooks/13/CLF-SwamiVivekananda-Quotes.pdf|work=consciouslivingfoundation.org|accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Conviction of the powers of goodness;
* Absence of jealousy and suspicion;
* Helping all who are trying to be and do good.

Swami Vivekananda suggested to try to give up jealousy and conceit and learn to work unitedly for others. He told that purity, patience and perseverance overcome all obstacles. He suggested to take courage and work on. Patience and steady work, according to Swami Vivekananda, this is the only way to get success.

According to Swami Vivekananda "faith in ourselves and faith in God- this is the secret of greatness. Swami Vivekananda observed the history of the world is the history of a few men who had faith in themselves, and it is faith which calls out divinity within. So he told, if people have faith in three hundred and thirty millions of [[Hindu]] mythological gods, and in all the gods which foreigners have now and still have no faith in themselves, there will be no salvation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vivekananda|first=Swami|title=My India: the India eternal|year=1996|publisher=Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture|location=Calcutta|isbn=81-85843-51-1|pages=110–111|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
Vivekananda believed education is the manifestation of perfection already in men.&lt;ref name="Swami Vivekananda: Life and Teachings, Belur Math" /&gt; He thought it a pity that the existing system of education did not enable a person to stand on his own feet, nor did it teach him self-confidence and self-respect. To Vivekananda, education was not only collection of information, but something more meaningful; he felt education should be man-making, life giving and character-building. To him education was an assimilation of noble ideas.&lt;ref name="My India India Eternal" /&gt; 
{{quote|Education is not the amount of information that we put into your brain and runs riot there, undigested, all your life. We must have life building, man making, character making assimilation of ideas. If you have assimilated five ideas and made them your life and character, you have more education than any man who has got by heart a whole library...&lt;ref name="The Future of India Wikisource"&gt;[[s:The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda/Volume 3/Lectures from Colombo to Almora/The Future of India]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Swami Vivekananda quotes"&gt;{{cite web|title=Swami Vivekananda quotes|url=http://jnanagni.com/quotes/swami-vivekananda/|work=jnanagni.com|accessdate=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  }}

Swami Vivekananda felt that the education that young boys and girls receive is very negative. He thinks they do not gain confidence or self-respect from these education, so according to Swami Vivekananda only positive education should be given to children.&lt;ref name="The Education that India needs"&gt;[[s:The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda/Volume 4/Translation: Prose/The Education that India needs]]&lt;/ref&gt; Swami Vivekananda told, if young boys and girls are encouraged and are not unnecessarily criticized all the time, they are bound to improve in time.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda/Volume 7/Conversations And Dialogues/X]]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt; He also told the youth: 
{{quote|Set yourselves to the task of spreading education among the masses. Tell them and make them understand, "You are our brothers—a part and parcel of our bodies, and we love you and never hate you."&lt;ref name="Vivekananda Reader"&gt;{{cite web | title=Vivekananda Reader | publisher=Advaita Ashrama | date=2012 | author=Narasimhananda, Swami | pages=335}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Womanhood==
Swami Vivekananda warned it is completely unfair to discriminate between sexes, as there is not any sex distinction in ''atman'' (soul), the soul has neither sex, nor caste nor imperfection. He suggested not to think that there are men and women, but only that there are human beings.&lt;ref name="Thoughts on Women SV"&gt;{{cite web|title=Thoughts on Women|url=http://www.writespirit.net/inspirational_talks/spiritual/swami_vivekananda_talks/thoughts-on-women-swami-vivekananda/index.html|work=writespirit.net|accessdate=30 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511145313/http://www.writespirit.net/inspirational_talks/spiritual/swami_vivekananda_talks/thoughts-on-women-swami-vivekananda/index.html|archivedate=11 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swami Vivekananda felt, The best thermometer to the progress of a nation is its treatment of its women&lt;ref name="Thoughts on Women SV"/&gt; and it is impossible to get back India's lost pride and honor unless they try to better the condition of women.&lt;ref name="Vivekananda's letters condition of women"&gt;{{cite web|title=Vivekananda's letters|url=http://www.angelfire.com/ma/vivekananda/vivekanandaletters.html|work=Angelfire|accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vivekananda considered men and women as two wings of a bird, and it is not possible for a bird to fly on only one wing. So, according to him, there is no chance for welfare of the world unless the condition of woman is improved.

Swami Vivekananda noticed almost everywhere women are treated as playthings. In modern countries like America, women have more independence, still, Vivekananda had noticed, men bow low, offer a woman a chair and in another breath they offer compliments like "Oh, how beautiful your eyes.." etc. Vivekananda felt, a man does not have any right to do this or venture so far, and any woman should not permit this as well. According to Swami Vivekananda such things develop the less noble side of humanity. They do not tend to noble ideals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vivekananda|first=Swami|title=My India: the India eternal|year=1996|publisher=Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture|location=Calcutta|isbn=8185843511|pages=68–69|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Vivekananda, the ideal of womanhood in [[India]] is motherhood &amp;ndash; that marvelous, unselfish, all-suffering, ever-forgiving mother.&lt;ref name="Swami Vivekananda RKMD"&gt;{{cite web|title=Swami Vivekananda|url=http://www.rkmdelhi.org/about-us/our-inspiration/swami-vivekananda/|work=rkmdelhi.org|accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vivekananda felt, in [[India]], there are two great evils &amp;ndash; trampling on the women, and grinding through the poor through caste restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Letters written from Chicago January 1895, To Mrs. Ole Bull|url=http://www.vivekananda.net/knownletters/1895Chicago.html|work=vivekananda.net|accessdate=30 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121055245/http://www.vivekananda.net/KnownLetters/1895Chicago.html|archivedate=21 January 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Swami Vivekananda]], [[Sita]] is typical of [[India]] &amp;ndash; the idealized [[India]]. Swami Vivekananda assured if world literature of the past and world literature of the future are thoroughly exhausted, yet, it'll not be possible to find out another [[Sita]], because [[Sita]] is unique, the character was depicted once for all. Swami Vivekananda felt there may have been several [[Rama]]s, perhaps, but never more than one [[Sita]].&lt;ref name="Valmiki's Sita"&gt;{{cite web|title=Valmiki's Sita|url=http://www.hindupedia.com/en/Valmiki%E2%80%99s_Sita|work=hindupedia.com|accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="A Vedantist's View of Mary"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Vedantist's View of Mary|url=http://www.vedanta-atlanta.org/articles/Mary.html|work=vedanta-atlanta.org|author=Swami Yogeshananda}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vivekananda felt:
{{cquote|All our mythology may vanish, even our Vedas may depart, and our Sanskrit language may vanish for ever, but so long as there will be five Hindus living here, even if only seeking the most vulgar patois, there will be the story of Sita present.&lt;ref name="The ideal of womanhood, Sita Y"&gt;{{cite web|title=The ideal of womanhood, Sita|url=http://www.yabaluri.org/TRIVENI/CDWEB/theidealofwomanhoodsitajan55.htm|work=yabaluri.org|accessdate=3 April 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130416061555/http://www.yabaluri.org/TRIVENI/CDWEB/theidealofwomanhoodsitajan55.htm|archivedate=16 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  }}
Sita was a true [[India]]n by nature, Vivekananda concluded, who never returned injury.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda/Volume 4/Lectures and Discourses/The Ramayana]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Anti-Œdipus Papers''''' is a collection of journal entries and notes written between 1969 and 1973&lt;ref&gt;Nadaud (2006, 11)&lt;/ref&gt; by the French philosopher and psychotherapist [[Félix Guattari]]. These notes, addressed to [[Gilles Deleuze]] by Guattari in preparation for ''[[Anti-Oedipus]]'' (1972), serve to substantiate their claims, finally bringing out the factory behind the theatre. They reveal Guattari as an inventive, highly analytical, mathematically-minded “conceptor,” arguably one of the most prolific and enigmatic figures in philosophy and sociopolitical theory today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Anti-Œdipus Papers|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/anti-%C5%93dipus-papers|website=The Anti-Œdipus Papers|publisher=The MIT Press|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though as a whole, the papers serve to expand upon, and propose their own, psychoanalytic theory, they are supplemented by journal entries explaining the relationships between Guattari and many of his companions including Deleuze, [[Jacques Lacan]], and [[Jean Oury]].

{{Socrates}}
'''Virtue ethics''' (or '''aretaic ethics'''&lt;ref&gt;David Carr, Jan Steutel (eds.), ''Virtue Ethics and Moral Education'', Routledge, 1999, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPAc-en|ˌ|ær|ə|ˈ|t|eɪ|.|ɪ|k}}, from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[wikt:ἀρετή|ἀρετή]] (''[[arete (moral virtue)|arete]]'')) are [[normative ethics|normative ethical]] theories which emphasize [[virtues]] of mind and character. Virtue ethicists discuss the nature and definition of [[virtues]] and other related problems. These include how virtues are acquired, how they are applied in various real life contexts, and whether they are rooted in a universal human nature or in a plurality of cultures.

== Key concepts ==
The western tradition's key concepts derive from [[ancient Greek philosophy]]. These theories include ''[[arete (moral virtue)|arete]]'' (excellence or virtue), ''[[phronesis]]'' (practical or moral wisdom), and ''[[eudaimonia]]'' (flourishing).

A virtue is generally agreed to be a character trait, such as a habitual action or settled sentiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2013/entries/ethics-virtue/|title=Virtue Ethics|last=Hursthouse|first=Rosalind|date=2013-01-01|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, a virtue is a positive trait that makes its possessor a good human being. A virtue is thus to be distinguished from single actions or feelings. [[Rosalind Hursthouse]] says:  &lt;blockquote&gt;A virtue such as honesty or generosity is not just a tendency to do what is honest or generous, nor is it to be helpfully specified as a “desirable” or “morally valuable” character trait. It is, indeed a character trait—that is, a disposition which is well entrenched in its possessor, something that, as we say “goes all the way down”, unlike a habit such as being a tea-drinker—but the disposition in question, far from being a single track disposition to do honest actions, or even honest actions for certain reasons, is multi-track. It is concerned with many other actions as well, with emotions and emotional reactions, choices, values, desires, perceptions, attitudes, interests, expectations and sensibilities. To possess a virtue is to be a certain sort of person with a certain complex mindset. (Hence the extreme recklessness of attributing a virtue on the basis of a single action.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;Practical wisdom is an acquired trait that enables its possessor to identify the thing to do in any given situation.&lt;ref&gt;Pincoffs, Edmund (1971). Quandary ethics. _Mind_ 80 (320):552-571.
&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike theoretical wisdom, practical reason results in action or decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2016/entries/aristotle-ethics/|title=Aristotle's Ethics|last=Kraut|first=Richard|date=2016-01-01|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Spring 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As John McDowell puts it, practical wisdom involves a "perceptual sensitivity" to what a situation requires.&lt;ref&gt;McDowell, John. "Virtue and Reason". _The Monist_. 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Eudaimonia]]'' (εὐδαιμονία) is a state variously translated from Greek as 'well-being', 'happiness', 'blessedness', and in the context of virtue ethics, 'human flourishing'.&lt;ref&gt;Pojman, L.P. &amp; Fieser, J. (2009). Virtue Theory. In ''Ethics: Discovering Right and Wrong'' (pp. 146-169). (6th ed.)  Belmont, CA: Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Eudaimonia'' in this sense is not a subjective, but an objective, state. It characterizes the well-lived life. According to Aristotle, the most prominent exponent of ''eudaimonia'' in the Western philosophical tradition, "eudaimonia" is the proper goal of human life. It consists of exercising the characteristic human quality—[[reason]]—as the soul's most proper and nourishing activity. In his ''Nicomachean Ethics'', Aristotle, like Plato before him, argued that the pursuit of ''eudaimonia'' is an "activity of the soul in accordance with perfect virtue",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aristotle|title=Nicomachean Ethics|pages=Book I}}&lt;/ref&gt; which further could only properly be exercised in the characteristic human community—the ''[[polis]]'' or [[city-state]].

Although ''eudaimonia'' was first popularized by Aristotle, it now belongs to the tradition of virtue theories generally. For the virtue theorist, ''eudaimonia'' describes that state achieved by the person who lives the proper human life, an outcome that can be reached by practicing the virtues.  A virtue is a habit or quality that allows the bearer to succeed at his, her, or its purpose. The virtue of a knife, for example, is sharpness; among the virtues of a racehorse is speed. Thus, to identify the virtues for human beings, one must have an account of what the human purpose is.

==History of virtue==
{{Catholic philosophy |expanded=all}}
Like much of the Western tradition, virtue theory seems to have originated in ancient [[Greek Philosophy|Greek philosophy]].

Virtue ethics began with [[Socrates]], and was subsequently developed further by [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and the [[Stoics]].&lt;ref&gt;P Gardiner - [http://jme.bmj.com/content/29/5/297 A virtue ethics approach to moral dilemmas in medicine] Journal of Medical Ethics / Volume 29, Issue 5 https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jme.29.5.297 Accessed November 24th, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Bowin -  [https://people.ucsc.edu/~jbowin/virtue.pdf Aristotle's Virtue Ethics] [[University of California, Santa Cruz |University of Santa Cruz (California)]] Accessed November 24th, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T. Chappell (2010) - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IiXfj1PCr9YC&amp;pg Plato: Oxford Bibliographies Online Research Guide] [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IiXfj1PCr9YC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=Virtue+ethics+began+with+Socrates&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjWwdOl6dfXAhVK1xoKHfxgBnYQ6AEIPzAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Virtue%20ethics%20began%20with%20Socrates&amp;f=false p.10] {{ISBN|019980902X}}  Accessed November 24th, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Virtue ethics refers to a collection of [[normative]] ethical philosophies that place an emphasis on being rather than doing.  Another way to say this is that in virtue ethics, morality stems from the identity or character of the individual, rather than being a reflection of the actions (or consequences thereof) of the individual.  Today, there is debate among various adherents of virtue ethics concerning what specific virtues are morally praiseworthy.  However, most theorists agree that morality comes as a result of intrinsic virtues. Intrinsic virtues are the common link that unites the disparate normative philosophies into the field known as virtue ethics. Plato and Aristotle's treatment of virtues are not the same. Plato believes virtue is effectively an end to be sought, for which a friend might be a useful means. Aristotle states that the virtues function more as means to safeguard human relations, particularly authentic friendship, without which one's quest for happiness is frustrated.

Discussion of what were known as the [[Four Cardinal Virtues]] – [[wisdom]], [[justice]], [[Cardinal virtues|fortitude]], and [[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]] – can be found in Plato's ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''. The virtues also figure prominently in Aristotle's moral theory (see below). Virtue theory was inserted into the study of [[history]] by moralistic historians such as [[Livy]], [[Plutarch]], and [[Tacitus]].  The Greek idea of the virtues was passed on in Roman philosophy through [[Cicero]] and later incorporated into [[Christian]] moral theology by [[St. Ambrose]] of Milan. During the [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] period, the most comprehensive consideration of the virtues from a theological perspective was provided by St. [[Thomas Aquinas]] in his ''[[Summa Theologica|Summa Theologiae]]'' and his ''Commentaries on the [[Nicomachean Ethics]]''.

Though the tradition receded into the background of European philosophical thought in these centuries, the term "virtue" remained current during this period, and in fact appears prominently in the tradition of [[classical republicanism]] or [[classical liberalism]]. This tradition was prominent in the intellectual life of 16th-century [[Italy]], as well as 17th- and 18th-century Britain and America; indeed the term "virtue" appears frequently in the work of [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], [[David Hume]], the republicans of the [[English Civil War]] period, the 18th-century English [[British Whig Party|Whigs]], and the prominent figures among the [[Scottish Enlightenment]] and the [[Founding Fathers|American Founding Fathers]].

Although some [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophers (e.g. [[David Hume|Hume]]) continued to emphasise the virtues, with the ascendancy of [[utilitarianism]] and [[deontology]], virtue theory moved to the margins of Western philosophy. The contemporary revival of virtue theory is frequently traced to the philosopher [[G. E. M. Anscombe]]'s 1958 essay "[[Modern Moral Philosophy]]". Following this:
* In the 1976 paper "[[The Schizophrenia of Modern Ethical Theories]]", Michael Stocker summarises the main aretaic criticisms of deontological and consequentialist ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stocker | first1 = Michael | year = 1976 | title = The Schizophrenia of Modern Ethical Theories | url = | journal = The Journal of Philosophy | volume = 73 | issue = 14| pages = 453–466 | doi = 10.2307/2025782 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Philippa Foot]], who published a collection of essays in 1978 entitled ''Virtues and Vices.''
* [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] has made an effort to reconstruct a virtue-based theory in dialogue with the problems of modern and [[postmodernism|postmodern]] thought; his works include ''[[After Virtue]]'' and ''Three Rival Versions of Moral Enquiry''.
* [[Paul Ricoeur]] has accorded an important place to Aristotelian [[teleological ethics]] in his [[hermeneutical]] [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of the subject, most notably in his book ''Oneself as Another''.
* Theologian [[Stanley Hauerwas]] has also found the language of virtue quite helpful in his own project.
* [[Rosalind Hursthouse]] has published ''On Virtue Ethics''.
* [[Roger Crisp]] and [[Michael Slote]] have edited a collection of important essays titled ''Virtue Ethics''.
* [[Martha Nussbaum]] and [[Amartya Sen]] have employed virtue theory in theorising the [[capability approach]] to [[international development]].
* [[Julia Annas]] wrote ''The Morality of Happiness'' (1993).
* [[Lawrence C. Becker]] identified current virtue theory with [[Stoicism]] (or [[Modern Stoicism]]) in ''A New Stoicism.'' (1998).

The '''aretaic turn'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; in moral philosophy is paralleled by analogous developments in other philosophical disciplines. One of these is [[epistemology]], where a distinctive [[virtue epistemology]] has been developed by [[Linda Trinkaus Zagzebski|Linda Zagzebski]] and others. In political theory, there has been discussion of "virtue politics", and in legal theory, there is a small but growing body of literature on [[virtue jurisprudence]]. The aretaic turn also exists in [[United States of America|American]] [[constitutional theory]], where proponents argue for an emphasis on virtue and vice of constitutional [[adjudicator]]s.

Aretaic approaches to morality, epistemology, and jurisprudence have been the subject of intense debates. One criticism that is frequently made focuses on the problem of guidance; opponents, such as Robert Louden in his article "Some Vices of Virtue Ethics", question whether the idea of a virtuous moral actor, believer, or judge can provide the guidance necessary for action, belief formation, or the decision of legal disputes.

== Lists of virtues ==
There are several different lists of particular virtues. Socrates argued that virtue is knowledge, which suggests that there is really only one virtue.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, Meno.&lt;/ref&gt; The Stoics concurred, claiming the four cardinal virtues were only aspects of true virtue. John McDowell is a recent defender of this conception. He argues that virtue is a "perceptual capacity" to identify how one ought to act, and that all particular virtues are merely "specialized sensitivities" to a range of reasons for acting.&lt;ref&gt;McDowell, John. "Virtue and reason." ''The monist'' 62.3 (1979): 331-350.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Aristotle's list

Aristotle identifies approximately eighteen virtues that enable a person to perform their human function well.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Nicomachean Ethics.''&lt;/ref&gt;  He distinguished virtues pertaining to emotion and desire from those pertaining to the mind.&lt;ref&gt;Nicomachean Ethics, Book II.&lt;/ref&gt; The first he calls "moral" virtues, and the second intellectual virtues (though both are "moral" in the modern sense of the word).  Each moral virtue was a mean (see [[Golden mean (philosophy)|golden mean]]) between two corresponding vices, one of excess and one of deficiency. Each intellectual virtue is a mental skill or habit by which the mind arrives at truth, affirming what is or denying what is not.&lt;ref&gt;''Nicomachean Ethics'' Book VI&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Nicomachean Ethics'' he discusses about 11 moral virtues:

;Moral Virtues

1. '''Courage''' in the face of fear

2. '''Temperance''' in the face of pleasure and pain

3. '''Liberality''' with wealth and possessions

4. '''Magnificence''' with great wealth and possessions

5. '''Magnanimity''' with great honors

6. '''Proper ambition''' with normal honors

7. '''Truthfulness''' with self-expression

8. '''Wittiness''' in conversation

9. '''Friendliness''' in social conduct

10. '''Modesty''' in the face of shame or shamelessness

11. '''Righteous indignation''' in the face of injury

;Intellectual virtues
# [[Nous]] (intelligence), which apprehends fundamental truths (such as definitions, self-evident principles)
# [[Episteme]] (science), which is skill with inferential reasoning (such as proofs, syllogisms, demonstrations)
# Sophia (theoretical wisdom), which combines fundamental truths with valid, necessary inferences to reason well about unchanging truths.
Aristotle also mentions several other traits: 
* Gnome (good sense) -- passing judgment, "sympathetic understanding" 
* Synesis (understanding) -- comprehending what others say, does not issue commands
* [[Phronesis]] (practical wisdom) -- knowledge of what to do, knowledge of changing truths, issues commands
* Techne (art, craftsmanship)
Aristotle's list is not the only list, however. As [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] observed in ''[[After Virtue]]'',  thinkers as diverse as: [[Homer]]; the authors of the [[New Testament]]; [[Thomas Aquinas]]; and [[Benjamin Franklin]]; have all proposed lists.&lt;ref&gt;MacIntyre, ''After Virtue'', chp 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Some philosophers criticise virtue ethics as [[culturally relative]]. Since different people, cultures and societies often have different opinions on what constitutes a virtue, perhaps there is no one objectively right list.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

For example, regarding what are the most important virtues, Aristotle proposed the following nine: wisdom; prudence; justice; fortitude; courage; liberality; magnificence; magnanimity; temperance.  In contrast, one modern-era philosopher proposed as the four cardinal virtues:  ambition/humility;  love;  courage;  and honesty.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Kaufmann, W.]], 1961. The Faith Of A Heretic. Doubleday &amp; Co., pages 317-338.&lt;/ref&gt;

As another example, regarding virtues once supposedly applicable to women, many would have once considered a virtuous woman to be quiet, servile, and industrious. This conception of female virtue no longer holds true in many modern societies. Proponents of virtue theory sometimes respond to this objection by arguing that a central feature of a virtue is its ''universal applicability''. In other words, any character trait defined as a virtue must reasonably be universally regarded as a virtue for all sentient beings. According to this view, it is inconsistent to claim for example servility as a female virtue, while at the same time not proposing it as a male one.

Other proponents of virtue theory, notably [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], respond to this objection by arguing that any account of the virtues must indeed be generated out of the community in which those virtues are to be practiced: the very word ''ethics'' implies "[[ethos]]". That is to say that the virtues are, and necessarily must be, grounded in a particular time and place. What counts as virtue in 4th-century Athens would be a ludicrous guide to proper behavior in 21st-century Toronto, and vice versa. To take this view does not necessarily commit one to the argument that accounts of the virtues must therefore be static: moral activity—that is, attempts to contemplate and practice the virtues—can provide the cultural resources that allow people to change, albeit slowly, the ethos of their own societies. [[Alasdair MacIntyre|MacIntyre]] appears to take this position in his seminal work on virtue ethics, ''[[After Virtue]]''. One might cite (though [[Alasdair MacIntyre|MacIntyre]] does not) the rapid emergence of [[abolitionism|abolitionist]] thought in the [[slave]]-holding societies of the 18th-century [[Atlantic world]] as an example of this sort of change: over a relatively short period of time, perhaps 1760 to 1800, in Britain, France, and British America, slave-holding, previously thought to be morally neutral or even virtuous, rapidly became seen as vicious among wide swathes of society. While the emergence of abolitionist thought derived from many sources, the work of [[David Brion Davis]], among others,{{who|date=January 2011}} has established that one source was the rapid, internal evolution of moral theory among certain sectors of these societies, notably the [[Quakers]].

Another objection to virtue theory is that the school does not focus on what ''sorts of actions'' are morally permitted and which ones are not, but rather on what sort of qualities someone ought to foster in order to become a good person. In other words, while some virtue theorists may not condemn, for example, murder as an inherently immoral or impermissible sort of action, they may argue that someone who commits a murder is severely lacking in several important virtues, such as [[compassion]] and [[wikt:fairness|fairness]]. Still, antagonists of the theory often object that this particular feature of the theory makes virtue ethics useless as a universal norm of acceptable conduct suitable as a base for [[legislation]]. Some virtue theorists concede this point, but respond by opposing the very notion of legitimate legislative [[authority]] instead, effectively advocating some form of [[anarchism]] as the political ideal.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} Others argue that laws should be made by virtuous legislators. Still others argue that it is possible to base a judicial system on the moral notion of virtues rather than rules.

Some virtue theorists might respond to this overall objection with the notion of a "bad act" also being an act characteristic of [[vice]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} That is to say that those acts that do not aim at virtue, or stray from virtue, would constitute our conception of "bad behavior". Although not all virtue ethicists agree to this notion, this is one way the virtue ethicist can re-introduce the concept of the "morally impermissible".  One could raise objection with Foot that she is committing an [[argument from ignorance]] by postulating that what is not virtuous is unvirtuous.  In other words, just because an action or person 'lacks of evidence' for virtue does not, [[ceteris paribus|all else constant]], imply that said action or person is unvirtuous.

=== Subsumed in deontology and utilitarianism ===

[[Martha Nussbaum]] has suggested that while virtue ethics is often considered to be anti-[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], "suspicious of theory and respectful of the wisdom embodied in local practices",&lt;ref name="Nussbaum" /&gt; it is actually neither fundamentally distinct from, nor does it qualify as a rival approach to deontology and utilitarianism. She argues that philosophers from these two Enlightenment traditions often include theories of virtue. She pointed out that [[Immanuel Kant|Kant's]] "Doctrine of Virtue" (in ''[[The Metaphysics of Morals]]'') "covers most of the same topics as do classical Greek theories", "that he offers a general account of virtue, in terms of the strength of the will in overcoming wayward and selfish inclinations; that he offers detailed analyses of standard virtues such as courage and self-control, and of vices, such as avarice, mendacity, servility, and pride; that, although in general he portrays inclination as inimical to virtue, he also recognizes that sympathetic inclinations offer crucial support to virtue, and urges their deliberate cultivation."&lt;ref name="Nussbaum"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nussbaum|first=Martha C.|title=Virtue Ethics: A Misleading Category?|journal=The Journal of Ethics|year=1999|volume=3|issue=3|pages=163–201|jstor=25115613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nussbaum also points to considerations of virtue by utilitarians such as [[Henry Sidgwick]] (''[[The Methods of Ethics]]''), [[Jeremy Bentham]] (''[[The Principles of Morals and Legislation]]''), and [[John Stuart Mill]], who writes of moral development as part of an argument for the moral equality of women (''[[The Subjection of Women]]''). She argues that contemporary virtue ethicists such as [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], [[Bernard Williams]], [[Philippa Foot]], and [[John McDowell]] have few points of agreement, and that the common core of their work does not represent a break from Kant.

=== Utopianism and pluralism ===

[[Robert Louden]] criticises virtue ethics on the basis that it promotes a form of unsustainable [[utopianism]]. Trying to come to ''a'' single set of virtues is immensely difficult in contemporary societies as, according to Louden, they contain "more ethnic, religious, and class groups than did the moral community which Aristotle theorized about" with each of these groups having "not only its own interests but its own set of virtues as well". Louden notes in passing that MacIntyre, a supporter of virtue-based ethics, has grappled with this in ''[[After Virtue]]'' but that ethics cannot dispense with building rules around acts and rely only on discussing the moral character of persons.&lt;ref name="Louden"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Louden|first=Robert B.|title=On Some Vices of Virtue Ethics|journal=American Philosophical Quarterly|date=July 1984|volume=21|issue=3|pages=227–236|jstor=20014051}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Topics in virtue ethics ==

=== Virtue ethics as a category ===
Virtue ethics can be contrasted to [[deontological]] ethics and [[consequentialist]] ethics by an examination of the other two (the three being together the most predominant contemporary normative ethical theories).

[[Deontological ethics]], sometimes referred to as duty ethics, places the emphasis on adhering to ethical principles or duties.  How these duties are defined, however, is often a point of contention and debate in deontological ethics.  One of the predominant rule schemes utilized by deontologists is the [[Divine Command Theory]]. Deontology also depends upon meta-ethical [[Philosophical realism|realism]], in that it postulates the existence of [[moral absolute]]s that make an action moral, regardless of circumstances.  For more information on deontological ethics refer to the work of [[Immanuel Kant]].

The next predominant school of thought in normative ethics is [[consequentialism]].  While deontology places the emphasis on doing one's duty, which is established by some kind of moral imperative (in other words, the emphasis is on obedience to some higher moral absolute), consequentialism bases the morality of an action upon the consequences of the outcome.  Instead of saying that one has a moral duty to abstain from murder, a consequentialist would say that we should abstain from murder because it causes undesirable effects.  The main contention here is what outcomes should/can be identified as objectively desirable.  The [[Greatest Happiness Principle]] of [[John Stuart Mill]] is one of the most commonly adopted criteria.  Mill asserts that our determinant of the desirability of an action is the net amount of happiness it brings, the number of people it brings it to, and the duration of the happiness.  He also tries to delineate classes of happiness, some being preferable to others, but there is a great deal of difficulty in classifying such concepts.  
{{see|Utilitarianism|Utilitarianism (book)|On Liberty}}
Virtue ethics differs from both deontology consequentialism as it focuses on being over doing. A virtue ethicist identifies [[virtues]], desirable characteristics, that the moral or virtuous person embodies.  Possessing these virtues is what makes one moral, and one's actions are a mere reflection of one's inner morality.  To the virtue philosopher, action cannot be used as a demarcation of morality, because a virtue encompasses more than just a simple selection of action.  Instead, it is about a way of being that would cause the person exhibiting the virtue to make a certain "virtuous" choice consistently in each situation.  There is a great deal of disagreement within virtue ethics over what are virtues and what are not.  There are also difficulties in identifying what is the "virtuous" action to take in all circumstances, and how to define a virtue.

Consequentialist and deontological theories often still employ the term 'virtue', but in a restricted sense, namely as a tendency or disposition to adhere to the system's principles or rules.  These very different senses of what constitutes virtue, hidden behind the same word, are a potential source of confusion.  This disagreement over the meaning of virtue points to a larger conflict between virtue theory and its philosophical rivals.  A system of virtue theory is only intelligible if it is [[teleological]]: that is, if it includes an account of the purpose (''telos'') of human life, or in popular language, the [[meaning of life]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}  Obviously, strong claims about the purpose of human life, or of what the good life for human beings is, will be highly controversial.  Virtue theory's necessary commitment to a teleological account of human life thus puts the tradition in sharp tension with other dominant approaches to normative ethics, which, because they focus on actions, do not bear this burden.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Virtue ethics mainly deals with the honesty and morality of a person. It states that practicing good habits such as honesty, generosity makes a moral and virtuous person. It guides a person without specific rules for resolving the ethical complexity.

=== Virtue and politics ===
Virtue theory emphasises [[Aristotle]]'s belief in the [[polis]] as the acme of political organisation, and the role of the virtues in enabling human beings to flourish in that environment. Classical republicanism in contrast emphasises [[Tacitus]]' concern that power and luxury can corrupt individuals and destroy liberty, as Tacitus perceived in the transformation of the [[Roman Republic]] into the [[Roman Empire]]; virtue for classical republicans is a shield against this sort of corruption and a means to preserve the good life one has, rather than a means by which to achieve the good life one does not yet have. Another way to put the distinction between the two traditions is that virtue ethics relies on Aristotle's fundamental distinction between the human-being-as-he-is from the human-being-as-he-should-be, while classical republicanism relies on the Tacitean distinction of the human-being-as-he-is from the human-being-as-he-is-at-risk-of-becoming.&lt;ref&gt;J.G.A. Pocock, The Machiavellian Moment&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Applied virtue ethics ===
Virtue ethics has a number of contemporary applications.

;Social and political philosophy
Within the field of social ethics, [[Deirdre McCloskey]] argues that virtue ethics can provide a basis for a balanced approach to understanding capitalism and capitalist societies.&lt;ref&gt;McCloskey, D. ''The Bourgeois Virtues: Ethics for an Age of Commerce.'' (2007) Chicago: University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|978-0-226-55664-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Education
Within the field of [[philosophy of education]], [[James Page (Australian educationist)|James Page]] argues that virtue ethics can provide a rationale and foundation for [[peace education]].&lt;ref&gt;Page, James S. (2008) '' Peace Education: Exploring Ethical and Philosophical Foundations. '' Charlotte: Information Age Publishing. {{ISBN|978-1-59311-889-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

; Health care and medical ethics

[[Thomas Alured Faunce]] has argued that whistleblowing in the healthcare setting would be more respected within clinical governance pathways if it had a firmer academic foundation in virtue ethics.&lt;ref&gt;Faunce TA Developing and Teaching the Virtue-Ethics Foundations of Healthcare Whistle Blowing Monash Bioethics Review 2004; 23(4): 41-55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Faunce TA and Jefferys S. Whistleblowing and Scientific Misconduct: Renewing Legal and Virtue Ethics Foundations Journal of Medicine and Law 2007, 26 (3): 567-84&lt;/ref&gt; He called for whistleblowing to be expressly supported in the [[UNESCO]] Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights.&lt;ref&gt;Faunce TA and Nasu H. Normative Foundations of Technology Transfer and Transnational Benefit Principles in the UNESCO Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human RightsJournal of Medicine and Philosophy, 0 : 1 – 26, 2009 {{doi|10.1093/jmp/jhp021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barry Schwartz argues that "practical wisdom" is an antidote to much of the inefficient and inhumane bureaucracy of modern health care systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/barry_schwartz_on_our_loss_of_wisdom?language=en|title=Our loss of wisdom|last=Schwartz|first=Barry|website=www.ted.com|access-date=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20707">The '''von Neumann–Wigner interpretation''', also described as "'''consciousness causes collapse''' [of the wave function]", is an [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics|interpretation of quantum mechanics]] in which [[consciousness]] is postulated to be necessary for the completion of the process of [[measurement in quantum mechanics|quantum measurement]].

== Background: observation in quantum mechanics ==
In the orthodox [[Copenhagen interpretation]], quantum mechanics predicts only the probabilities for different outcomes of pre-specified observations. What constitutes an "observer" or an "observation" is not directly specified by the theory, and the behavior of a system upon observation is completely different than its usual behavior: the wavefunction that describes a system spreads out into an ever-larger superposition of different possible situations. However, during observation, the wavefunction describing the system collapses to one of several options. If there is no observation, this collapse does not occur, and none of the options ever becomes less likely.

It can be predicted using quantum mechanics, absent a collapse postulate, that an observer observing a quantum superposition will turn into a superposition of different observers seeing different things. The observer will have a wavefunction which describes all the possible outcomes. Still, in actual experience, an observer never senses a superposition, but always senses that one of the outcomes has occurred with certainty. This apparent conflict between a wavefunction description and classical experience is called the problem of observation (see [[Measurement problem]]).

== The interpretation ==

In his 1932 book ''The Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics'', [[John von Neumann]] argued that the mathematics of quantum mechanics allows the [[Wave function collapse|collapse of the wave function]] to be placed at any position in the causal chain from the measurement device to the "subjective perception" of the human observer.  In 1939, [[Fritz London]] and Edmond Bauer argued for the latter boundary (consciousness).&lt;ref&gt;F. London and E. Bauer, "La théorie de l’observation en mécanique quantique" (1939), English translation in ''Quantum Theory and Measurement'', edited by J. A. Wheeler and W. H. Zurek, Princeton University, Princeton, 1983, pp. 217–259.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1960s, [[Eugene Wigner]]&lt;ref name="Wigner"&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1119/1.1973829| volume = 35| issue = 12| pages = 1169–1170| last = Wigner| first = Eugene| author2 = Henry Margenau| title = Remarks on the Mind Body Question, in Symmetries and Reflections, Scientific Essays| journal = American Journal of Physics| accessdate = 2009-07-30| date = 1967| url = http://link.aip.org/link/?AJP/35/1169/1| bibcode = 1967AmJPh..35.1169W| archive-url = https://archive.is/20130112081842/http://link.aip.org/link/?AJP/35/1169/1| archive-date = 2013-01-12| dead-url = yes| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; reformulated the "[[Schrödinger's cat]]" [[thought experiment]] as "[[Wigner's friend]]" and proposed that the consciousness of an observer is the demarcation line that precipitates collapse of the wave function, independent of any realist interpretation.  See [[Wigner's friend#Consciousness and measurement|Consciousness and measurement]]. The non-physical mind is postulated to be the only true measurement apparatus.&lt;ref name=Schreiber&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9501014v5 Schreiber, Z. ''The Nine Lives of Schrödingers's Cat''].&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Rudolf Peierls]] was also a proponent of this interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;P. C. W. Davies and J. R. Brown (editors), ''The Ghost in the Atom'', Cambridge University Press, 1986, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

This interpretation has been summarized thus:&lt;ref name=Schreiber/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The rules of quantum mechanics are correct but there is only one system which may be treated with quantum mechanics, namely the entire material world. There exist external observers which cannot be treated within quantum mechanics, namely human (and perhaps animal) ''minds'', which perform [[quantum measurement|measurement]]s on the brain causing wave function collapse.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Henry Stapp]] has argued for the concept as follows:&lt;ref name="Stapp2001"&gt;{{cite journal |author=H. Stapp |title=Quantum Theory and the Role of Mind in Nature |journal=Foundations of Physics |volume=31 |issue=10 |pages=1465–1499 |year=2001 |doi=10.1023/A:1012682413597|arxiv=quant-ph/0103043 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
From the point of view of the mathematics of quantum theory it makes no sense to treat a measuring device as intrinsically different from the collection of atomic constituents that make it up. A device is just another part of the physical universe...  Moreover, the conscious thoughts of a human observer ought to be causally connected ''most directly and immediately'' to what is happening in his brain, not to what is happening out at some measuring device...  Our bodies and brains thus become ... parts of the quantum mechanically described physical universe. Treating the entire physical universe in this unified way provides a conceptually simple and logically coherent theoretical foundation...
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Objections to the interpretation ==

There are other possible solutions to the "Wigner's friend" thought experiment, which do not require consciousness to be different from other physical processes.  Moreover, Wigner actually shifted to those interpretations (and away from "consciousness causes collapse") in his later years. This was partly because he was embarrassed that "consciousness causes collapse" can lead to a kind of [[solipsism]], but also because he decided that he had been wrong to try to apply quantum physics at the scale of everyday life (specifically, he rejected his initial idea of treating macroscopic objects as isolated systems).&lt;ref name=Esfeld&gt;Michael Esfeld, (1999), [http://www.unil.ch/webdav/site/philo/shared/DocsPerso/EsfeldMichael/1999/SHPMP99.pdf Essay Review: Wigner’s View of Physical Reality], published in Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics, 30B, pp. 145–154, Elsevier Science Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Wigner's friend#Consciousness and Superposition|Consciousness and Superposition]].

To many scientists this interpretation fails to compete with other [[interpretations of quantum mechanics]] because "consciousness causes collapse" relies upon an [[Interactionism (philosophy of mind)|interactionist]] form of [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] that is inconsistent with the [[materialism]] presupposed by many physicists.&lt;ref name=Schreiber/&gt; The [[measurement problem]] notwithstanding, they point to a [[Causal closure|causal closure of physics]], suggesting a problem with how consciousness and matter might interact, reminiscent of objections to Descartes' [[substance dualism]].

{{quote|The only form of [[interactionist dualism]] that has seemed even remotely tenable in the contemporary picture is one that exploits certain properties of quantum mechanics. There are two ways this might go. First, some [e.g., [[How the Self Controls Its Brain|Eccles 1986&amp;#x5D;]] have appealed to the existence of [[quantum indeterminacy]], and have suggested that a nonphysical consciousness might be responsible for filling the resultant causal gaps, [[determinism|determining]] which values some physical magnitudes might take within an apparently "[[probabilistic]]" distribution… This is an audacious and interesting suggestion, but it has a number of problems… A second way in which quantum mechanics bears on the issue of [[causal closure]] lies with the fact that in some [[interpretations of quantum mechanics|interpretations of the quantum formalism]], consciousness itself plays a vital causal role, being required to bring about the so-called "[[wave function collapse|collapse of the wave-function]]." This collapse is supposed to occur upon any act of [[measurement in quantum mechanics|measurement]]; and in one interpretation, the only way to distinguish a measurement from a nonmeasurement is via the presence of consciousness. This theory is certainly not universally accepted (for a start, it ''presupposes'' that consciousness is not itself [[physicalism|physical]], surely contrary to the views of most physicists), and I do not accept it myself, but in any case it seems that the kind of causal work consciousness performs here is quite different from the kind required for consciousness to play a role in [[free will|directing behavior]]… In any case, all versions of interactionist dualism have a conceptual problem that suggests that they are less successful in avoiding [[epiphenomenalism]] than they might seem; or at least they are no better off than &amp;#x5B;[[naturalistic dualism]]&amp;#x5D;. Even on these views, there is a sense in which the [[phenomenalism|phenomenal]] is irrelevant. We can always subtract the phenomenal component from any explanatory account, yielding a purely [[causality|causal]] component.&lt;ref name="Chalmers1996"&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Chalmers |year=1996 |title=The Conscious Mind: In Search of a Fundamental Theory |series=Philosophy of Mind Series |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |isbn=978-0-19-983935-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XtgiH-feUyIC&amp;pg=PA156 |pages=156–157}}&lt;/ref&gt;|[[David Chalmers]]|"The Irreducibility of Consciousness" in ''The Conscious Mind: In Search of a Fundamental Theory''}}

The interpretation has also been criticized for not explaining which things have sufficient consciousness to collapse the wave function. Also, it posits an important role for the conscious mind, and it has been questioned how this could be the case for the earlier universe, before consciousness had evolved or emerged.  It has been argued that "[consciousness causes collapse] does not allow sensible discussion of [[Big Bang]] cosmology or biological [[evolution]]".&lt;ref name=Schreiber/&gt; For example, [[Roger Penrose]] remarked: "[T]he evolution of conscious life on this planet is due to appropriate mutations having taken place at various times.  These, presumably, are quantum events, so they would exist only in linearly superposed form until they finally led to the evolution of a conscious being—whose very existence depends on all the right mutations having 'actually' taken place!"&lt;ref&gt;R. Penrose, ''The Emperor's New Mind'', Penguin Books, 1989, p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others further suppose a universal mind (see also [[panpsychism]] and [[panexperientialism]]). To most physicists{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}, this merely pushes the problem back, which some see as a fatal [[Occam's razor|unparsimonious]] move in a competition with [[interpretations of quantum mechanics|other theories]].

Recently, it has been argued that the results of [[delayed-choice quantum eraser]] experiments preclude this interpretation.&lt;ref name=Yu_and_Nikolic&gt;{{cite journal | author = Yu S., Nikolić D. | year = 2011 | title = Quantum mechanics needs no consciousness | url = http://www.danko-nikolic.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Yu-and-Nikolic-Qm-and-consciousness-Annalen-Physik.pdf | journal = Annalen der Physik | volume = 523 | issue = 11| pages = 931–938 | doi = 10.1002/andp.201100078|bibcode = 2011AnP...523..931Y }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the experiment has also been used to argue for support of this interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0610241&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.4834&lt;/ref&gt;  Other researchers have expressed similar objections to the introduction of any subjective element in the collapse of the wavefunction.&lt;ref name=Mandel&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mandel L. | year = 1999 | title = Quantum effects in one-photon and two-photon interference | journal = Rev.

== Reception ==

A poll was conducted at a quantum mechanics conference in 2011 using 33 participants (including physicists, mathematicians, and philosophers). Researchers found that 6% of participants (2 of the 33) indicated that they believed the observer "plays a distinguished physical role (e.g., wave-function collapse by consciousness)". This poll also states that 55% (18 of the 33) indicated that they believed the observer "plays a fundamental role in the application of the formalism but plays no distinguished physical role". They also mention that "Popular accounts have sometimes suggested that the Copenhagen interpretation attributes such a role to consciousness. In our view, this is to misunderstand the Copenhagen interpretation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=M. Schlosshauer |author2=J. Koer |author3=A.

=== Views of the pioneers of quantum mechanics ===

Many of the originators of quantum mechanical theory held that humans can effectively interrogate nature through interacting with it, and that in this regard quantum mechanics is not different from [[classical mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Wiley| last = Bohr| first = Niels| title = Atomic Physics and Human Knowledge| year = 1958}}, pp. 73, 81: "The freedom of experimentation, presupposed in classical physics, is of course retained and corresponds to the free choice of experimental arrangement for which the mathematical structure of the quantum mechanical formalism offers the appropriate latitude.  ...  In the great drama of existence we ourselves are both actors and spectators.”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Harper &amp; Row| last = Heisenberg| first = Werner| title = Physics and Philosophy| year = 1958}}, p. 32: "[T]he measuring device has been constructed by the observer, and we have to remember that what we observe is not nature in itself but nature exposed to our method of questioning."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal= Dialectica |author=Wolfgang Pauli| title= Naturwissenschaftliche und erkenntnistheoretische Aspekte der Ideen vom Unbewussten| volume=8| pages=283–301| year= 1954| doi=10.1111/j.1746-8361.1954.tb01265.x}} as translated in Harald Atmanspacher and Hans Primas, ''Journal of Consciousness Studies'' 13(3), 5-50 (2006):  "Pauli’s ideas on mind and matter in the context of contemporary science": “Once the physical observer has chosen his experimental arrangement, he has no further influence on the result which is objectively registered and generally accessible. Subjective properties of the observer or his psychological state are as irrelevant in the quantum mechanical laws of nature as in classical physics.”&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, Werner Heisenberg maintained that [[wave function collapse]], "The discontinuous change in the probability function", takes place when the result of a measurement is registered in the mind of an observer. However, this is because he understood the probability function as an artifact of human knowledge: he also argued that the reality of the material transition from "possible" to "actual" was mind-independent. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Harper &amp; Row| last = Heisenberg| first = Werner| title = Physics and Philosophy| year = 1958}}, p. 28. ("The transition from the 'possible' to the 'actual' takes place  as soon as the interaction of the object with the measuring device, and thereby the rest of the world, has come into play; it is not connected with the act of registration of the result by the mind of the observer.   The discontinuous change in the probability function, however, takes place with the act of registration, because it is the discontinuous change of our knowledge in the instant of registration that has its image in the discontinuous change of the probability function.")&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Albert Einstein]], who believed in [[philosophical realism|realism]], and did not accept the theoretical completeness of quantum mechanics, similarly appealed for the merely epistemic conception of the wave function:

&lt;blockquote&gt;“[I advocate] that one conceives of the psi-function [i.e., wavefunction] only as an incomplete description of a real state of affairs, where the incompleteness of the description is forced by the fact that observation of the state is only able to grasp part of the real factual situation. Then one can at least escape the singular conception that observation (conceived as an act of consciousness) influences the real physical state of things; the change in the psi-function through observation then does not correspond essentially to the change in a real matter of fact but rather to the alteration in ''our knowledge'' of this matter of fact.”&lt;ref&gt;A. Einstein to W. Heitler, 1948, translated in A. Fine, ''Einstein’s Interpretations of Quantum Theory'' p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Heisenberg and Bohr described quantum mechanics in [[logical positivism|logical positivist]] terms. Bohr also took an active interest in the philosophical implications of quantum theories such as his [[complementarity (physics)|complementarity]], for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Zygon: Journal of Religion &amp; Science |author=John Honner |title= Niels Bohr and the Mysticism of Nature |volume=17-3 |pages=243–253 |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed quantum theory offers a complete description of nature, albeit one that is simply ill-suited for everyday experiences - which are better described by classical mechanics and probability. Bohr never specified a demarcation line above which objects cease to be quantum and become classical. He believed that it was not a question of physics, but one of philosophy or convenience.&lt;ref name="Bohr1928"&gt;{{cite journal| journal= Nature |author=Niels Bohr| title= The Quantum Postulate and the Recent Development of Atomic Theory| volume=121 |pages=580–590| year= 1928 |url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v121/n3050/abs/121580a0.html | doi=10.1038/121580a0|bibcode = 1928Natur.121..580B }} ": "[T]he quantum postulate implies that any observation of atomic phenomena will involve an interaction with the agency of observation not to be neglected. Accordingly, an independent reality in the ordinary physical sense can neither be ascribed to the phenomena nor to the agencies of observation.  After all, the concept of observation is in so far arbitrary as it depends upon which objects are included in the system to be observed.  Ultimately, every observation can, of course, be reduced to our sense perceptions.  The circumstance, however, that in interpreting observations use has always to be made of theoretical notions entails that for every particular case it is a question of convenience at which point the concept of observation involving the quantum postulate with its inherent "irrationality" is brought in."&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3489">'''Wonderism''' is a term coined by French sinologist [[Terrien de Lacouperie]] (1845-1894) to differentiate the proto-Daoism of [[Jixia Academy]] from the philosophical [[Daoism]] of [[Laozi]], although his ideas were received with skepticism at the time of assertion [[Albert_Étienne_Jean_Baptiste_Terrien_de_Lacouperie#Evaluations_of_Terrien.27s_theories|and have since been discredited by modern sinology]].{{elaboration needed|reason=linked section does not mention this idea|date=December 2016}}

Lacouperie believed that Chinese civilization was influenced by early sea traders from the [[Erythraean Sea]] and [[Indian Ocean]] who established a settlement in [[East China]] circa 675 BCE. It was located in the [[Zhou Dynasty]] state of [[Qi (Shandong)|Qi]] 齊 (present day [[Shandong]] Province) at Langye 琅琊 (near [[Linyi]]) and [[Jimo, Shandong|Jimo]] 即墨 (northeast and southwest of [[Jiaozhou Bay]]). In the history of [[Ancient Chinese coinage]], Jimo was an important mint where large bronze [[knife money]] called "Qi knives" were manufactured.&lt;ref&gt; Albert Étienne Terrien de Lacouperie (1892), [https://books.google.com/books?id=xZAUAAAAYAAJ Catalogue of Chinese coins from the VIIth cent. B.C. to A.D. 621, Including the Series in the British Museum], Gilbert and Rivington, p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;These foreigners, Sabaeans, Syrians and Hindus introduced new notions, such as astrology and superstitions, and by their sailors' yarns awakened a curiosity for the wonderful. The social and political condition of the country was favourable to a movement of this sort. The Chinese princes were anxious of novelty to show their independence from the once respected and now disregarded suzerainty of the Kings of Chou. It was really an age of wonderism.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Terrien de Lacouperie (1892), [https://books.google.com/books?id=0QULAAAAYAAJ The Oldest Book of the Chinese, the Yh-king, and its Authors], D. Nutt, pp. 114-115.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Lacouperie, this [[school of thought]] combined with early philosophical Daoism to create religious Daoism. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The school of Wonderism, which had grown out of the influence of the trader-colonists of the Indian Ocean settled at Lang-ya and Tsih-Moh who had taught Astrology and an overrated conception of the transforming powers of nature, amalgamated with the pure Taoism of Lao-tze, and formed henceforth what may be called the Neo-Taoism or Tao-szeism, while Confucianism remained in opposition to it, such as his founder had conceived it against the encroachments of Wonderism, Taoism, and Shamanism. It was indeed the rising of Confucianism which led to the fusion of these various elements. &lt;ref&gt;Albert Étienne Terrien de Lacouperie (1894), [https://archive.org/details/westernoriginofe00terrrich Western Origin of the Early Chinese Civilisation from 2300 B.C. to 200 A.D.: or, Chapters on the Elements Derived from the old Civilisations of West Asia in the Formation of the Ancient Chinese Culture], Asher &amp; Co., p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This terminology is outmoded. "Taoszeism" (from the French [[Romanization of Chinese|romanization]] ''tao-sze'' for ''daoshi'' 道士 "Daoist master, Daoist priest/priestess") was used by [[Léon de Rosny]] in reference to religious Daoism. "Neotaoism" or "Neodaoism" usually refers to [[Xuanxue]] 玄學 (lit. "arcane studies").

[[Image:Ernst Haeckel 2.jpg|thumb|170px|right| [[Ernst Haeckel]] wrote about the ''World Riddle'' in 1895]]

The term "'''world riddle'''" or "'''world-riddle'''" has been associated, for over 100 years, with [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (who mentioned ''Welträthsel'' in several of his writings)
and with the [[biologist]]-[[philosopher]] [[Ernst Haeckel]], who, as a [[professor]] of [[zoology]] at the [[University of Jena]],&lt;ref name=Ha1911&gt;

The term "world riddle" concerns the nature of the universe and the [[meaning of life]].

The question and answer of the World Riddle has also been examined as an inspiration or [[allegory|allegorical meaning]] within some musical compositions, such as the unresolved harmonic progression at the end of ''[[Also sprach Zarathustra (Strauss)|Also sprach Zarathustra]]'' (1896) by [[composer]] [[Richard Strauss]], made famous in the film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.&lt;ref&gt;

== View of Nietzsche ==
[[Image:FWNietzscheSiebe.jpg|thumb|120px|right| [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].]]

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] referred to the "World Riddle" (''Welträthsel'') in several of his writings; however, his direct influence was limited to a few years, by his failing health.{{cn|date=June 2015}}

== View of Haeckel ==
[[Ernst Haeckel]] viewed the World Riddle as a dual-question of the form, "What is the nature of the physical universe and what is the nature of human thinking?" which he explained would have a single answer since humans and the universe were contained within one system, a mono-system, as Haeckel wrote in 1895:

&lt;/ref&gt;
:: [From ''Monism as Connecting Religion and Science'' by Ernst Haeckel (translated):]
:: "The following lecture on [[Monism]] is an informal address delivered extemporaneously on October 9, 1892, at Altenburg, on the seventy-fifth anniversary of the ''"Naturforschende Gesellschaft des Osterlandes."'' ... The "exacting" [[Berlin]] [[physiologist]] shut this knowledge out from his mind, and, with a short-sightedness almost inconceivable, placed this special [[neurological]] question alongside of the one great "'''world-riddle'''," the fundamental question of substance, the general question of the connection between matter and energy.  As I long ago pointed out, these two great questions are not two separate "'''world-riddles'''." The neurological problem of [[consciousness]] is only a special case of the all-comprehending [[cosmology|cosmological]] problem, the question of substance. "If we understood the nature of matter and energy, we should also understand how the substance underlying them can under certain conditions feel, desire, and think." Consciousness, like feeling and willing, among the higher animals is a mechanical work of the [[ganglion|ganglion-cells]], and as such must be carried back to chemical and physical events in the [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] of these.  -Ernst Haeckel, 1895 &lt;ref name=PGmono/&gt;

Haeckel had written that human behavior and feeling could be explained, within the laws of the physical universe, as "mechanical work of the ganglion-cells" as stated.

== View of William James ==
The [[philosopher]] [[William James]] in his book ''[[Pragmatism]]'' (1907) wrote about the world-riddle, as follows:

:: [From ''Pragmatism'' (Lecture VII) by William James:]
:: "All the great single-word answers to the world's riddle, such as God, the One, Reason, Law, Spirit, Matter, Nature, Polarity, the [[Dialectic]] Process, the Idea, the Self, the Oversoul, draw the admiration that men have lavished on them from this oracular role. By amateurs in philosophy and professionals alike, the universe is represented as a queer sort of petrified sphinx whose appeal to man consists in a monotonous challenge to his divining powers. THE Truth: what a perfect idol of the rationalistic mind!"

William James has questioned the attitude of thinking that a single answer applies to everything or everyone.  In the passage, the capitalized "THE" signifies the viewpoint meaning "the one and only" [[absolute truth]].

'''Zeno's paradoxes''' are a set of [[philosophy|philosophical]] problems generally thought to have been devised by [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] philosopher [[Zeno of Elea]] (c. 490–430 BC) to support [[Parmenides]]' doctrine that contrary to the evidence of one's senses, the belief in [[Ontological pluralism|plurality]] and change is mistaken, and in particular that [[motion (physics)|motion]] is nothing but an [[illusion]].  It is usually assumed, based on [[Plato|Plato's]] [[Parmenides (dialogue)|''Parmenides'']] (128a–d), that Zeno took on the project of creating these [[paradox]]es because other philosophers had created paradoxes against Parmenides' view.  Thus Plato has Zeno say the purpose of the paradoxes "is to show that their hypothesis that existences are many, if properly followed up, leads to still more absurd results than the hypothesis that they are one."&lt;ref&gt;''Parmenides'' 128d&lt;/ref&gt; Plato has [[Socrates]] claim that Zeno and Parmenides were essentially arguing exactly the same point.&lt;ref&gt;''Parmenides'' 128a–b&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Zeno's nine surviving paradoxes (preserved in [[Physics (Aristotle)|Aristotle's ''Physics'']]&lt;ref name=aristotle&gt;[http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.html Aristotle's ''Physics''] "Physics" by Aristotle translated by R. P. Hardie and R. K. Gaye

and [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius's]] commentary thereon) are essentially equivalent to one another. Aristotle offered a refutation of some of them.&lt;ref name=aristotle/&gt;  Three of the strongest and most famous—that of Achilles and the tortoise, the [[Dichotomy]] argument, and that of an arrow in flight—are presented in detail below.

Zeno's arguments are perhaps the first examples of a method of proof called ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' also known as [[proof by contradiction]].  They are also credited as a source of the [[dialectic]] method used by Socrates.&lt;ref&gt;([fragment 65], Diogenes Laertius. [http://classicpersuasion.org/pw/diogenes/dlzeno-eleatic.htm IX] 25ff and VIII 57).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some mathematicians and historians, such as [[Carl Boyer]], hold that Zeno's paradoxes are simply mathematical problems, for which modern [[calculus]] provides a mathematical solution.&lt;ref name=boyer&gt;{{cite book |last=Boyer |first=Carl |title=The History of the Calculus and Its Conceptual Development |url=https://books.google.com/?id=w3xKLt_da2UC&amp;dq=zeno+calculus&amp;q=zeno#v=snippet&amp;q=zeno |year=1959 |publisher=Dover Publications  |accessdate=2010-02-26 |page=295 | quote=If the paradoxes are thus stated in the precise mathematical terminology of continuous variables (...) the seeming contradictions resolve themselves. |isbn=978-0-486-60509-8 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Some [[philosopher]]s, however, say that Zeno's paradoxes and their variations (see [[Thomson's lamp]]) remain relevant [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] problems.&lt;ref name=KBrown/&gt;&lt;ref name=FMoorcroft&gt;{{cite web |first=Francis |last=Moorcroft |title=Zeno's Paradox |url=http://www.philosophers.co.uk/cafe/paradox5.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100418141459/http://www.philosophers.co.uk/cafe/paradox5.htm |archivedate=2010-04-18 }}

The origins of the paradoxes are somewhat unclear. [[Diogenes Laertius]], a fourth source for information about Zeno and his teachings, citing [[Favorinus]], says that Zeno's teacher Parmenides was the first to introduce the Achilles and the tortoise paradox. But in a later passage, Laertius attributes the origin of the paradox to Zeno, explaining that Favorinus disagrees.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laertius, ''Lives'', 9.23 and 9.29.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Paradoxes of motion ==

=== Achilles and the tortoise ===
{{Redirect|Achilles and the Tortoise}}
[[File:Race between Achilles and the tortoise.gif|thumb|Distance vs. time, assuming the tortoise to run at Achilles' half speed]]
[[File:Zeno Achilles Paradox.png|thumb|left|Achilles and the tortoise]]

}}
In the paradox of [[Achilles]] and the [[tortoise]], Achilles is in a footrace with the tortoise. Achilles allows the tortoise a [[Head start (positioning)|head start]] of 100 meters, for example. Supposing that each racer starts running at some constant speed (one very fast and one very slow), then after some finite [[time]], Achilles will have run 100 meters, bringing him to the tortoise's starting point. During this time, the tortoise has run a much shorter distance, say, 10 meters. It will then take Achilles some further time to run that distance, by which time the tortoise will have advanced farther; and then more time still to reach this third point, while the tortoise moves ahead. Thus, whenever Achilles arrives somewhere the tortoise has been, he still has some distance to go before he can even reach the tortoise.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Dichotomy paradox ===

Suppose Homer wishes to walk to the end of a path. Before he can get there, he must get halfway there. Before he can get halfway there, he must get a quarter of the way there. Before traveling a quarter, he must travel one-eighth; before an eighth, one-sixteenth; and so on.

The resulting sequence can be represented as:
:&lt;math&gt; \left\{ \cdots,  \frac{1}{16},  \frac{1}{8},  \frac{1}{4},  \frac{1}{2},  1 \right\}&lt;/math&gt;

This description requires one to complete an infinite number of tasks, which Zeno maintains is an impossibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lindberg|first1=David|title=The Beginnings of Western Science|date=2007|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-48205-7|page=33|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This sequence also presents a second problem in that it contains no first distance to run, for any possible ([[wikt:finite|finite]]) first distance could be divided in half, and hence would not be first after all. Hence, the trip cannot even begin. The paradoxical conclusion then would be that travel over any finite distance can neither be completed nor begun, and so all motion must be an [[illusion]]. An alternative conclusion, [[Duration (philosophy)#Responses to Kant and Zeno|proposed]] by [[Henri Bergson]], is that motion (time and distance) is not actually divisible.

This argument is called the ''[[Dichotomy]]'' because it involves repeatedly splitting a distance into two parts. It contains some of the same elements as the ''Achilles and the Tortoise'' paradox, but with a more apparent conclusion of motionlessness. It is also known as the '''Race Course''' paradox. Some, like Aristotle, regard the Dichotomy as really just another version of ''Achilles and the Tortoise''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Huggett |first=Nick |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paradox-zeno/#Dic |title=Zeno's Paradoxes: 3.1 The Dichotomy |year=2010 |work=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |accessdate=2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arrow paradox ===
[[File:Zeno Arrow Paradox.png|thumb|The arrow]]

{{quote|If everything when it occupies an equal space is at rest, and if that which is in locomotion is always occupying such a space at any moment, the flying arrow is therefore motionless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.6.vi.html#752 |work=The Internet Classics Archive |title=Physics |author=Aristotle |quote=Zeno's reasoning, however, is fallacious, when he says that if everything when it occupies an equal space is at rest, and if that which is in locomotion is always occupying such a space at any moment, the flying arrow is therefore motionless. This is false, for time is not composed of indivisible moments any more than any other magnitude is composed of indivisibles.}}&lt;/ref&gt;|as recounted by [[Aristotle]], [[Physics (Aristotle)|''Physics'']] VI:9, 239b5}}

In the arrow paradox (also known as the '''[[fletching|fletcher's]] paradox'''), Zeno states that for motion to occur, an object must change the position which it occupies. He gives an example of an arrow in flight. He states that in any one (duration-less) instant of time, the arrow is neither moving to where it is, nor to where it is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | chapter-url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Lives_of_the_Eminent_Philosophers/Book_IX#Pyrrho | first=Diogenes |last=Laertius |authorlink=Diogenes Laërtius | title=[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]] | volume=IX |chapter=Pyrrho  |at= passage 72 | year=c. 230| isbn=1-116-71900-2  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It cannot move to where it is not, because no time elapses for it to move there; it cannot move to where it is, because it is already there. In other words, at every instant of time there is no motion occurring.  If everything is motionless at every instant, and time is entirely composed of instants, then motion is impossible.

Whereas the first two paradoxes divide space, this paradox starts by dividing time—and not into segments, but into points.&lt;ref name=HuggettArrow&gt;{{cite web |last=Huggett |first=Nick |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paradox-zeno/#Arr |title=Zeno's Paradoxes: 3.3 The Arrow |year=2010 |work=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |accessdate=2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Three other paradoxes as given by Aristotle ==

=== Paradox of Place ===
From Aristotle:
{{quote
|If everything that exists has a place, place too will have a place, and so on ''[[ad infinitum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.4.iv.html ''Physics'' IV:1, 209a25]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Paradox of the Grain of Millet ===
Description of the paradox from the ''Routledge Dictionary of Philosophy'':
{{quote
|The argument is that a single grain of [[millet]] makes no sound upon falling, but a thousand grains make a sound. Hence a thousand nothings become something, an absurd conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;The Michael Proudfoot, A.R. Lace. Routledge Dictionary of Philosophy. Routledge 2009, p. 445&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Aristotle's refutation:
{{quote
|Zeno is wrong in saying that there is no part of the millet that does not make a sound: for there is no reason why any such part should not in any length of time fail to move the air that the whole bushel moves in falling. In fact it does not of itself move even such a quantity of the air as it would move if this part were by itself: for no part even exists otherwise than potentially.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.7.vii.html ''Physics'' VII:5, 250a20]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Description from Nick Huggett:
{{quote
|This is a [[Parmenides|Parmenidean]] argument that one cannot trust one's sense of hearing. Aristotle's response seems to be that even inaudible sounds can add to an audible sound.&lt;ref&gt;Huggett, Nick, "Zeno's Paradoxes", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paradox-zeno/#GraMil&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== The Moving Rows (or Stadium) ===
[[File:Zeno Moving Rows Paradox.png|thumb|The moving rows]]From Aristotle:
{{quote
|... concerning the two rows of bodies, each row being composed of an equal number of bodies of equal size, passing each other on a race-course as they proceed with equal velocity in opposite directions, the one row originally occupying the space between the goal and the middle point of the course and the other that between the middle point and the starting-post. This...involves the conclusion that half a given time is equal to double that time.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.6.vi.html ''Physics'' VI:9, 239b33]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For an expanded account of Zeno's arguments as presented by Aristotle, see [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius']] commentary ''On Aristotle's Physics''.

== Proposed solutions ==

=== Diogenes the Cynic ===
According to [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]], [[Diogenes the Cynic]] said nothing upon hearing Zeno's arguments, but stood up and walked, in order to demonstrate the falsity of Zeno's conclusions (see ''[[solvitur ambulando]]''). To fully solve any of the paradoxes, however, one needs to show what is wrong with the argument, not just the conclusions. Through history, several solutions have been proposed, among the earliest recorded being those of Aristotle and Archimedes.

=== Aristotle ===
[[Aristotle]] (384 BC−322 BC) remarked that as the distance decreases, the time needed to cover those distances also decreases, so that the time needed also becomes increasingly small.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. Physics 6.9
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Aristotle's observation that the fractional times also get shorter does not guarantee, in every case, that the task can be completed. One case in which it does not hold is that in which the fractional times decrease in a [[Harmonic series (mathematics)|harmonic series]], while the distances decrease geometrically, such as: 1/2 s for 1/2 m gain, 1/3 s for next 1/4 m gain, 1/4 s for next 1/8 m gain, 1/5 s for next 1/16 m gain, 1/6 s for next 1/32 m gain, etc. In this case, the distances form a convergent series, but the times form a [[divergent series]], the sum of which has no limit. Archimedes developed a more explicitly mathematical approach than Aristotle.&lt;/ref&gt;
Aristotle also distinguished "things infinite in respect of divisibility" (such as a unit of space that can be mentally divided into ever smaller units while remaining spatially the same) from things (or distances) that are infinite in extension ("with respect to their extremities").&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. Physics 6.9; 6.2, 233a21-31&lt;/ref&gt;
Aristotle's objection to the arrow paradox was that "Time is not composed of indivisible nows any more than any other magnitude is composed of indivisibles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Aristotle |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.6.vi.html |title=Physics |volume=VI |at=Part 9 verse: 239b5 |isbn=0-585-09205-2 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thomas Aquinas ===
[[Thomas Aquinas]],&lt;!-- please do not change to Saint Thomas Aquinas, see [[MOS:SAINTS]] --&gt; commenting on Aristotle's objection, wrote "Instants are not parts of time, for time is not made up of instants any more than a magnitude is made of points, as we have already proved. Hence it does not follow that a thing is not in motion in a given time, just because it is not in motion in any instant of that time."&lt;ref&gt;Aquinas. Commentary on Aristotle's Physics, Book 6.861
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Archimedes ===
Before 212 BC, [[Archimedes]] had developed a method to derive a finite answer for the sum of infinitely many terms that get progressively smaller. (See: [[Geometric series]], [[1/4 + 1/16 + 1/64 + 1/256 + · · ·]], ''[[The Quadrature of the Parabola]]''.) Modern calculus achieves the same result, using more rigorous methods (see [[convergent series]], where the "reciprocals of powers of 2" series, equivalent to the Dichotomy Paradox, is listed as convergent). These methods allow the construction of solutions based on the conditions stipulated by Zeno, i.e. the amount of time taken at each step is geometrically decreasing.&lt;ref name=boyer /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George B. Thomas, ''Calculus and Analytic Geometry'', Addison Wesley, 1951&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bertrand Russell ===
[[Bertrand Russell]] offered what is known as the "at-at theory of motion". It agrees that there can be no motion "during" a durationless instant, and contends that all that is required for motion is that the arrow be at one point at one time, at another point another time, and at appropriate points between those two points for intervening times. In this view motion is a function of position with respect to time.&lt;ref name=HuggettBook&gt;{{ cite book |title=Space From Zeno to Einstein |first=Nick |last=Huggett |year=1999 |isbn=0-262-08271-3 }}

Salmon | page=198 |isbn=978-0-19-510864-4 |year=1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nick Huggett ===
Nick Huggett argues that Zeno is [[begging the question|assuming the conclusion]] when he says that objects that occupy the same space as they do at rest must be at rest.&lt;ref name=HuggettArrow/&gt;

=== Peter Lynds ===
Peter Lynds has argued that all of Zeno's motion paradoxes are resolved by the conclusion that instants in time and instantaneous magnitudes do not physically exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/1197/|title=Zeno's Paradoxes: A Timely Solution|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Lynds, Peter. Time and Classical and Quantum Mechanics: Indeterminacy vs. Discontinuity. Foundations of Physics Letter s (Vol. 16, Issue 4, 2003). doi:10.1023/A:1025361725408
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Time’s Up Einstein"&gt;
[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.06/physics.html Time’s Up Einstein], Josh McHugh, [[Wired Magazine]], June 2005
&lt;/ref&gt;
Lynds argues that an object in relative motion cannot have an instantaneous or determined relative position (for if it did, it could not be in motion), and so cannot have its motion fractionally dissected as if it does, as is assumed by the paradoxes. For more about the inability to know both speed and location, see [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]].

=== Hermann Weyl ===
Another proposed solution is to question one of the assumptions Zeno used in his paradoxes (particularly the Dichotomy), which is that between any two different points in space (or time), there is always another point. Without this assumption there are only a finite number of distances between two points, hence there is no infinite sequence of movements, and the paradox is resolved. The ideas of [[Planck length]] and [[Planck time]] in modern physics place a limit on the measurement of time and space, if not on time and space themselves. According to [[Hermann Weyl]], the assumption that space is made of finite and discrete units is subject to a further problem, given by the "[[Weyl's tile argument|tile argument]]" or "distance function problem".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Van Bendegem|first=Jean Paul|title=Finitism in Geometry|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/geometry-finitism/#SomParSolProDea|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=2012-01-03|date=17 March 2010 }}

&lt;/ref&gt;
According to this, the length of the hypotenuse of a right angled triangle in discretized space is always equal to the length of one of the two sides, in contradiction to geometry. [[Jean Paul Van Bendegem]] has argued that the Tile Argument can be resolved, and that discretization can therefore remove the paradox.&lt;ref name=boyer/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=187807 |title=Discussion:Zeno's Paradoxes and the Tile Argument |first=Jean Paul |last=van Bendegem |location= Belgium |year=1987 |journal=Philosophy of Science |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=295–302|doi=10.1086/289379}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== The paradoxes in modern times ==
Infinite processes remained theoretically troublesome in mathematics until the late 19th century. The [[Ε-δ definition|epsilon-delta]] version of [[Karl Weierstrass|Weierstrass]] and [[Augustin Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]] developed a rigorous formulation of the logic and calculus involved. These works resolved the mathematics involving infinite processes.&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lee |first=Harold | title=Are Zeno's Paradoxes Based on a Mistake? |jstor=2251675 |year=1965 |journal= [[Mind (journal)|Mind]] |volume=74 |issue=296 |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages= 563–570 |doi=10.1093/mind/LXXIV.296.563}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=russell&gt;[[Bertrand Russell|B Russell]] (1956) ''Mathematics and the metaphysicians'' in "The World of Mathematics" (ed.

claim that mathematics does not address the central point in Zeno's argument, and that solving the mathematical issues does not solve every issue the paradoxes raise.

Popular literature often misrepresents Zeno's arguments. For example, Zeno is often said to have argued that the sum of an infinite number of terms must itself be infinite–with the result that not only the time, but also the distance to be travelled, become infinite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Benson|first= Donald C.|title= The Moment of Proof : Mathematical Epiphanies|year= 1999|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= New York|isbn= 978-0195117219|page= 14|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=8_vbuzxrpfIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A humorous take is offered by [[Tom Stoppard]] in his play Jumpers (1972), in which the principal protagonist, the philosophy professor George Moore, suggests that according to Zeno’s paradox, [[Saint Sebastian]], a 3rd Century Christian saint supposedly martyred by being shot with arrows, died of fright.  However, none of the original ancient sources has Zeno discussing the sum of any infinite series. Simplicius has Zeno saying "it is impossible to traverse an infinite number of things in a finite time". This presents Zeno's problem not with finding the ''sum'', but rather with ''finishing'' a task with an infinite number of steps: how can one ever get from A to B, if an infinite number of (non-instantaneous) events can be identified that need to precede the arrival at B, and one cannot reach even the beginning of a "last event"?&lt;ref name=KBrown/&gt;&lt;ref name=FMoorcroft/&gt;&lt;ref name=Papa-G /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Huggett |first=Nick |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paradox-zeno/#ZenInf |title=Zeno's Paradoxes: 5. Zeno's Influence on Philosophy |year=2010 |work=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |accessdate=2011-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Debate continues on the question of whether or not Zeno's paradoxes have been resolved. In ''The History of Mathematics: An Introduction'' (2010) Burton writes, "Although Zeno's argument confounded his contemporaries, a satisfactory explanation incorporates a now-familiar idea, the notion of a 'convergent infinite series.'".&lt;ref&gt;Burton, David, ''A History of Mathematics: An Introduction'', McGraw Hill, 2010, {{isbn|978-0-07-338315-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bertrand Russell]] offered a "solution" to the paradoxes based on the work of [[Georg Cantor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |date=2002 |title=Our Knowledge of the External World: As a Field for Scientific Method in Philosophy |chapter=Lecture 6. The Problem of Infinity Considered Historically |publisher=Routledge |page=169 |orig-year=First published in 1914 by The Open Court Publishing Company |isbn=0-415-09605-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Brown concludes "Given the history of 'final resolutions', from Aristotle onwards, it's probably foolhardy to think we've reached the end. It may be that Zeno's arguments on motion, because of their simplicity and universality, will always serve as a kind of [[Rorschach test|'Rorschach image']] onto which people can project their most fundamental phenomenological concerns (if they have any)."&lt;ref name=KBrown/&gt;

==A similar ancient Chinese philosophic consideration==
[[History of Science and Technology in China|Ancient Han Chinese]] philosophers from the [[School of Names|Mohist School of Names]] during the [[Warring States period|Warring States period of China (479-221 BCE)]] independently developed equivalents to some of Zeno's paradoxes. The scientist and historian [[Joseph Needham|Sir Joseph Needham]], in his ''[[Science and Civilisation in China]]'', describes an [[History of Science and Technology in China|ancient Chinese]] paradox from the surviving [[School of Names|Mohist School of Names]] book of logic which states, in the [[archaism|archaic]] [[Old Chinese|ancient Chinese script]], "a one-foot stick, every day take away half of it, in a myriad ages it will not be exhausted." Several other paradoxes from this philosophical school (more precisely, movement) are known, but their modern interpretation is more speculative.

== Quantum Zeno effect ==
{{Main article|Quantum Zeno effect}}

In 1977,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  |bibcode=1977JMP....18..756M |last=Sudarshan |first=E. C. G. |authorlink=E. C. G.

&lt;/ref&gt; physicists [[E. C. George Sudarshan]] and B. Misra discovered that the dynamical evolution (motion) of a quantum system can be hindered (or even inhibited) through observation of the system.&lt;ref name="u0"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.boulder.nist.gov/timefreq/general/pdf/858.pdf |format=PDF |author1=W.M.Itano |author2=D.J.

&lt;/ref&gt; This effect is usually called the "quantum Zeno effect" as it is strongly reminiscent of Zeno's arrow paradox. This effect was first theorized in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  |last=Khalfin |first=L.A. |author-link=   |journal=Soviet Phys. JETP |volume=6 |page=1053 |year=1958 |url= |doi=   |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |bibcode = 1958JETP....6.1053K  |title=Contribution to the Decay Theory of a Quasi-Stationary State }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Zeno behaviour ==
In the field of verification and design of [[timed event system|timed]] and [[hybrid system]]s, the system behaviour is called ''Zeno'' if it includes an infinite number of discrete steps in a finite amount of time.&lt;ref name="Fishwick2007"&gt;{{cite book | editor=Paul A.  Fishwick | title=Handbook of dynamic system modeling | url=https://books.google.com/?id=cM-eFv1m3BoC&amp;pg=SA15-PA22 | accessdate=2010-03-05 | edition=hardcover | series=Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC Computer and Information Science | date=1 June 2007 | publisher=CRC Press | location=Boca Raton, Florida, USA | isbn=978-1-58488-565-8 | pages=15–22 to 15–23 | chapter=15.6 "Pathological Behavior Classes" in chapter 15  "Hybrid Dynamic Systems: Modeling and Execution" by Pieter J.  Mosterman, The Mathworks, Inc. }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[formal verification]] techniques exclude these behaviours from analysis, if they are not equivalent to non-Zeno behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lamport |first=Leslie |authorlink=Leslie Lamport |year=2002 |title=Specifying Systems |format=PDF |publisher=Addison-Wesley |isbn=0-321-14306-X |url=http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/book-02-08-08.pdf |page=128 |accessdate=2010-03-06 }}

In [[systems design]] these behaviours will also often be excluded from system models, since they cannot be implemented with a digital controller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Henzinger |first2=Thomas |last1=Franck |first1=Cassez |first3=Jean-Francois |last3=Raskin |url=http://mtc.epfl.ch/~tah/Publications/a_comparison_of_control_problems_for_timed_and_hybrid_systems.html |title=A Comparison of Control Problems for Timed and Hybrid Systems |year=2002 |accessdate=2010-03-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528193234/http://mtc.epfl.ch/~tah/Publications/a_comparison_of_control_problems_for_timed_and_hybrid_systems.html |archivedate=May 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
