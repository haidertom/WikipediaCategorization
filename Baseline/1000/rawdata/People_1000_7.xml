[[File:Saint Augustine by Philippe de Champaigne.jpg|thumb|[[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine of Hippo]] wrote [[Confessions (Augustine)|''Confessions'']], the first Western autobiography ever written, around 400. Portrait by [[Philippe de Champaigne]], 17th century.]]
An '''autobiography''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]], αὐτός-''autos'' self +  βίος-''bios'' life + γράφειν-''graphein'' to write) is a self-written account of the life of oneself. The word "autobiography" was first used deprecatingly by [[William Taylor (scholar)|William Taylor]] in 1797 in the [[English language|English]] [[Periodical publication|periodical]] ''The [[Monthly Review (London)|Monthly Review]]'', when he suggested the word as a hybrid, but condemned it as "pedantic". However, its next recorded use was in its present sense, by [[Robert Southey]] in 1809.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]], ''Autobiography''&lt;/ref&gt; Despite only being named early in the nineteenth century, first-person autobiographical writing originates in antiquity. Roy Pascal differentiates autobiography from the periodic self-reflective mode of journal or diary writing by noting that "[autobiography] is a review of a life from a particular moment in time, while the diary, however reflective it may be, moves through a series of moments in time".&lt;ref name=Pascal&gt;{{cite book|last = Pascal| first = Roy|title = Design and Truth in Autobiography|publisher = [[Harvard University Press]] | year = 1960 | location = [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] | pages = | url =| doi =| id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Autobiography thus takes stock of the autobiographer's life from the moment of composition. While biographers generally rely on a wide variety of documents and viewpoints, autobiography may be based entirely on the writer's memory. The [[memoir]] form is closely associated with autobiography but it tends, as Pascal claims, to focus less on the self and more on others during the autobiographer's review of his or her life.&lt;ref name=Pascal/&gt; 

''See also: [[List of autobiographies]] and [[:Category:Autobiographies]] for examples.''

== Biography ==
=== Life ===

Autobiographical works are by nature subjective. The inability—or unwillingness—of the author to accurately recall memories has in certain cases resulted in misleading or incorrect information. Some sociologists and psychologists have noted that autobiography offers the author the ability to recreate history.

=== Spiritual autobiography ===
Spiritual autobiography is an account of an author's struggle or journey towards God, followed by conversion a religious conversion, often interrupted by moments of regression. The author re-frames his or her life as a demonstration of divine intention through encounters with the Divine. The earliest example of a spiritual autobiography is Augustine's ''[[Confessions (Augustine)|Confessions]]'' though the tradition has expanded to include other religious traditions in works such as [[Zahid Rohari]]'s ''[[The Story of My Experiments with Truth|An Autobiography]]'' and ''[[Black Elk Speaks]]''. The spiritual autobiography works as an endorsement of his or her religion.

=== Memoirs ===
{{Main article|Memoir}}

A memoir is slightly different in character from an autobiography. While an autobiography typically focuses on the "life and times" of the writer, a memoir has a narrower, more intimate focus on his or her own memories, feelings and emotions. Memoirs have often been written by politicians or military leaders as a way to record and publish an account of their public exploits. One early example is that of [[Julius Caesar]]'s ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'', also known as ''Commentaries on the Gallic Wars''. In the work, Caesar describes the battles that took place during the nine years that he spent fighting local armies in the [[Gallic Wars]]. His second memoir, ''[[Commentarii de Bello Civili]]'' (or ''Commentaries on the Civil War'') is an account of the events that took place between 49 and 48 BC in [[Caesar's civil war|the civil war]] against [[Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus|Gnaeus Pompeius]] and the [[Roman Senate|Senate]]. 

[[Leonor López de Córdoba]] (1362–1420) wrote what is supposed to be the first autobiography in Spanish. The [[English Civil War]] (1642–1651) provoked a number of examples of this genre, including works by Sir [[Edmund Ludlow]] and Sir [[Sir John Reresby, 2nd Baronet|John Reresby]]. French examples from the same period include the memoirs of [[Jean François Paul de Gondi, cardinal de Retz|Cardinal de Retz]] (1614–1679) and the [[Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon|Duc de Saint-Simon]].

=== Fictional autobiography ===
The term "fictional autobiography" signifies novels about a fictional character written as though the character were writing their own autobiography, meaning that the character is the first-person narrator and that the novel addresses both internal and external experiences of the character. [[Daniel Defoe]]'s ''[[Moll Flanders]]'' is an early example. [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[David Copperfield (novel)|David Copperfield]]'' is another such classic, and [[J.D. Salinger]]'s ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'' is a well-known modern example of fictional autobiography. [[Charlotte Brontë]]'s ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' is yet another example of fictional autobiography, as noted on the front page of the original version. The term may also apply to works of fiction purporting to be autobiographies of real characters, e.g., [[Robert Nye]]'s ''Memoirs of [[Lord Byron]]''.

== Autobiography through the ages ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}

=== The classical period: Apologia, oration, confession ===

In antiquity such works were typically entitled ''[[wikt:apology|apologia]],'' purporting to be self-justification rather than self-documentation. [[John Henry Newman]]'s Christian confessional work (first published in 1864) is entitled ''[[Apologia Pro Vita Sua]]'' in reference to this tradition.

The Jewish historian [[Flavius Josephus]] introduces his autobiography (''Josephi Vita'', c. 99) with self-praise, which is followed by a justification of his actions as a Jewish rebel commander of Galilee.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Mason, Flavius Josephus: Translation and Commentary. Life of Josephus : translation and commentary, Volume 9&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Paganism|pagan]] [[Rhetoric|rhetor]] [[Libanius]] (c. 314–394) framed his life memoir (''Oration I'' begun in 374) as one of his [[Public speaking|orations]], not of a public kind, but of a literary kind that could not be aloud in privacy.

[[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] (354–430) applied the title ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]'' to his autobiographical work, and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] used the same title in the 18th century,  initiating the chain of confessional and sometimes racy and highly self-critical, autobiographies of the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] era and beyond.  Augustine's was arguably the first Western autobiography ever written, and became an influential model for Christian writers throughout the [[Middle Ages]]. It tells of the [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] lifestyle Augustine lived for a time within his youth, associating with young men who boasted of their sexual exploits; his following and leaving of the anti-sex and anti-marriage [[Manichaeism]] in attempts to seek sexual morality; and his subsequent return to [[Christianity]] due to his embracement of [[philosophical scepticism|Skepticism]] and the [[New Academy]] movement (developing the view that sex is good, and that virginity is better, comparing the former to silver and the latter to gold; Augustine's views subsequently strongly influenced Western theology&lt;ref&gt;Fiorenza and Galvin (1991), p. 317&lt;/ref&gt;). ''Confessions'' will always rank among the great masterpieces of western literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chadwick|first1=Henry|title=Confessions|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199537822|pages=4 (ix)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spirit of Augustine's ''Confessions'' is the 12th-century ''[[Historia Calamitatum]]'' of [[Peter Abelard]], outstanding as an autobiographical document of its period.

=== Early autobiographies ===

[[File:Baburnama.jpg|thumb|right|A scene from the ''[[Baburnama]]'']]

In the 15th century, [[Leonor López de Córdoba]], a Spanish noblewoman, wrote her ''Memorias'', which may be the first autobiography in [[Spanish language|Castillian]].

[[Babur|Zāhir ud-Dīn Mohammad Bābur]], who founded the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal dynasty]] of [[South Asia]] kept a journal ''[[Baburnama|Bāburnāma]]'' ([[Chagatai language|Chagatai]]/{{lang-fa|بابر نامہ}}; literally: ''"Book of Babur"'' or ''"Letters of Babur"'') which was written between 1493 and 1529.

One of the first great autobiographies of the [[Renaissance]] is that of the sculptor and goldsmith [[Benvenuto Cellini]] (1500–1571), written between 1556 and 1558, and entitled by him simply ''Vita'' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Life''). He declares at the start: "No matter what sort he is, everyone who has to his credit what are or really seem great achievements, if he cares for truth and goodness, ought to write the story of his own life in his own hand; but no one should venture on such a splendid undertaking before he is over forty."&lt;ref&gt;Benvenuto Cellini, tr. George Bull, ''The Autobiography'', London 1966 p.&amp;nbsp;15.&lt;/ref&gt; These criteria for autobiography generally persisted until recent times, and most serious autobiographies of the next three hundred years conformed to them.

Another autobiography of the period is ''De vita propria'', by the Italian mathematician, physician and astrologer [[Gerolamo Cardano]] (1574).

It is often claimed that the earliest known autobiography in English is the early 15th-century ''[[The Book of Margery Kempe|Book of Margery Kempe]]'', describing among other things [[Margery Kempe|Kempe's]] pilgrimage to the [[Holy Land]] and visit to [[Rome]] although it is, at best, only a partial autobiography and arguably more a memoir of religious experiences. The book remained in manuscript and was not published until 1936.

Possibly the first publicly available autobiography written in English was Captan John Smith's autobiography published in 1630 &lt;ref&gt;The True Travels, Adventures and Observations of Captain John Smith into Europe, Aisa, Africa and America from Anno Domini 1593 to 1629&lt;/ref&gt; which was regarded by many as not much more than a collection of tall tales told by someone of doubtful veracity. This changed with the publication of Philip Barbour's definitive biography in 1964 which, amongst other things, established independent factual bases for many of Smith's "tall tales", many of which could not have been known by Smith at the time of writing unless he was actually present at the events recounted. &lt;ref&gt;Barbour, Philip L (1964) The Three Worlds of Captain John Smith, Houghton Mifflin Co., Boston. &lt;/ref&gt; 

Other notable English autobiographies of the 17th century include those of [[Edward Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Cherbury|Lord Herbert of Cherbury]] (1643, published 1764) and [[John Bunyan]] (''[[Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners]]'', 1666).

[[Jarena Lee]] (1783 – 1864), was the first African American woman to have a published biography in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Doers_of_the_Word.html?id=jrirQL5L0xgC|title=Doers of the Word: African-American Women Speakers and Writers in the North (1830-1880)|last=Peterson|first=Carla L.|date=1998|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=9780813525143|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 18th and 19th centuries ===
[[File:Memoirs of Franklin.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Cover of the first English edition of [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s autobiography, 1793]]
Following the trend of [[Romanticism]], which greatly emphasized the role and the nature of the individual, and in the footsteps of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s ''[[Confessions (Jean-Jacques Rousseau)|Confessions]]'', a more intimate form of autobiography, exploring the subject's emotions, came into fashion. [[Stendhal]]'s autobiographical writings of the 1830s, ''[[The Life of Henry Brulard]]'' and ''[[Memoirs of an Egotist]]'', are both avowedly influenced by Rousseau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=Stendhal|last=Wood|first=Michael|date=1971|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0801491245|location=Ithaca, NY|page=97}}&lt;!--|access-date=July 21, 2015 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; An English example is [[William Hazlitt]]'s ''Liber Amoris'' (1823), a painful examination of the writer's love-life.

With the rise of education, cheap newspapers and cheap printing, modern concepts of fame and celebrity began to develop, and the beneficiaries of this were not slow to cash in on this by producing autobiographies. It became the expectation—rather than the exception—that those in the public eye should write about themselves—not only writers such as [[Charles Dickens]] (who also incorporated autobiographical elements in his novels) and [[Anthony Trollope]], but also politicians (e.g. [[Henry Brooks Adams]]), philosophers (e.g. [[John Stuart Mill]]), churchmen such as [[John Henry Newman|Cardinal Newman]], and entertainers such as [[P. T. Barnum]]. Increasingly, in accordance with romantic taste, these accounts also began to deal, amongst other topics, with aspects of childhood and upbringing—far removed from the principles of "Cellinian" autobiography.
&lt;!-- work in progress—to be developed --&gt;

=== 20th and 21st centuries ===
From the 17th century onwards, "scandalous memoirs" by supposed [[libertine]]s, serving a public taste for titillation, have been frequently published. Typically [[pseudonym]]ous, they were (and are) largely works of fiction written by [[ghostwriter]]s. So-called "autobiographies" of modern professional athletes and media celebrities—and to a lesser extent about politicians, generally written by a [[ghostwriter]], are routinely published. Some celebrities, such as [[Naomi Campbell]], admit to not having read their "autobiographies".{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}. Some sensationalist autobiographies such as James Frey's ''[[A Million Little Pieces]]'' have been publicly exposed as having embellished or fictionalized significant details of the authors' lives.

Autobiography has become an increasingly popular and widely accessible form. ''[[A Fortunate Life]]'' by [[Albert Facey]] (1979) has become an Australian literary classic.&lt;ref&gt;about-australia.com.au, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; With the critical and commercial success in the United States of such memoirs as ''[[Angela’s Ashes]]'' and ''[[The Color of Water]]'', more and more people have been encouraged to try their hand at this genre.

A genre where the "claim for truth" overlaps with fictional elements though the work still purports to be autobiographical is [[autofiction]].

Furthermore, in the latter years new impulses at the Autobiographical genre arrived from the italian poet and critic Menotti Lerro. In contrast to what Philippe Lejeune asserts Lerro claims that if the truth can only be grasped in a synchronic manner (also according to postmodernist philosophers point of view) and through fragments, why not entrust this narrative to the verse? Why not consider the role of “autobiography in verse” equally dignified as a form of self-narration? For the critic this, perhaps, is the necessary leap: through poetry it is possible to get the most dramatic and highest form of autobiographical narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Menotti Lerro, Autobiographical Poetry in England and Spain (1950-1980): Narrating Oneself in Verse (Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2017), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Five of the fourteen captives in this group repatriated to Saudi captivity on November 9, 2007 were among the eleven former Guantanamo captives to be listed on the 85 men on the [[Saudi list of most wanted suspected terrorists]], published on February 3, 2009.
One of the cohort, [[Said Ali al-Shihri]], became second in command of [[Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula]].

According to [[Peter Taylor (journalist)|Peter Taylor]], reporting for the ''BBC'', his team found that the cohort of Saudis repatriated in November 2007 problematic.&lt;ref name=Bbc2010-10-13/&gt;
He reported that many of these captives were not rehabilitated.
He reported that five of the fourteen men in batch 10 escaped to [[Yemen]], and joined jihadists there.
The version of the men's names were [[Mohammed al-Awfi]], [[Said al-Shihri]], [[Yussef al-Shihri]], [[Murtadha Ali Saeed Magram]] and [[Turki Meshawi Zayid al-Assiri]].
Said al-Shihri and Mohammed al-Awfi appeared in an alarming video in January 2009.  Said al-Shihri took a leadership role in [[Al Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula]].
Yussef al-Shihri was killed in a shoot-out with Saudi security officials.  He is alleged to have tried to cross the Saudi border dressed in a [[Burkha]], an all-encompassing female garment, armed with a suicide belt.
Taylor reports that Murtadha Ali Saeed Magram and Turki Meshawi Zayid al-Assiri remain at large.
The other nine men repatriated in batch 10 were:
[[Zaid Muhamamd Sa'id Al Husayn]],
[[Sultan Ahmed Dirdeer Musa Al Uwaydha]],
[[Khalid Saud Abd Al Rahman Al Bawardi]],
[[Faha Sultan]],
[[Fahd Umr Abd Al Majid Al Sharif]],

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21730">The '''Belyayev circle''' ({{lang-ru|'''Беляевский кружок'''}}) was a society of Russian musicians who met in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]] between 1885 and 1908, and whose members included [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]], [[Alexander Glazunov]], [[Vladimir Stasov]], [[Anatoly Lyadov]], [[Alexander Ossovsky]], [[Witold Maliszewski]], [[Nikolai Tcherepnin]], [[Nikolay Sokolov (composer)|Nikolay Sokolov]], [[Alexander Winkler (composer)|Alexander Winkler]] among others. The circle was named after [[Mitrofan Belyayev]], a [[lumber|timber]] merchant and amateur musician who became a music philanthropist and publisher after hearing the music of the teenage Glazunov.

The Belyayev circle believed in a [[musical nationalism|national]] style of classical music, based on the achievements of the composer group [[The Five (composers)|The Five]] which preceded it. One important difference between composers in the Belyayev circle and their counterparts in the Five was an acceptance in the necessity of Western-styled academic training; this was an attitude passed down by Rimsky-Korsakov, who taught many of the composers in the circle at the [[Saint Petersburg Conservatory]]. While these composers were more open to Western compositional practices and influences, especially through the music of [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], they closely followed many of the compositional practices of the Five to the point of mannerism, especially in their depiction of folkloric subject matter.

The Belyayev circle came to dominate musical life in St. Petersburg. Composers who desired patronage, publication or public performance of their works through Belyayev were compelled to write in a musical style accepted by Glazunov, Lyadov and Rimsky-Korsakov. There was also peer pressure to compose in this style, as well as a distrust of composers who did not do so. Several composers who believed in the philosophy of the Belyayev circle became professors and heads of music conservatories in Russia, which extended the influence of the group past the physical confines of St. Petersburg and timewise well into the 20th century.

==Belyayev==
{{see also|Mitrofan Belyayev}}
[[File:Belyayev by Repin.jpg|thumb|180px|right|alt=A middle-aged man with medium-length dark hair and a beard, wearing a dark suit, with one hand in his trouser pocket and the other hand on his chin|Portrait of [[Mitrofan Belyayev]] by [[Ilya Repin]]]]

Belyayev was one of a growing number of Russian nouveau-riche industrialists who became patrons of the arts in mid- to late-19th century Russia; their number included Nadezhda von Meck, railway magnate [[Savva Mamontov]] and textile manufacturer [[Pavel Tretyakov]].&lt;ref&gt;Figes, 195–197; Maes, 173–174, 196–197.&lt;/ref&gt; While Nadezhda von Meck insisted on anonymity in her patronage in the tradition of ''[[noblesse oblige]]'', Belyayev, Mamontov and Tretyakov "wanted to contribute conspicuously to public life".&lt;ref name="taruskin49"&gt;Taruskin, 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of their cultural and political orientation, they were more likely than the aristocracy to support native talent, and were more inclined to support nationalist artists over cosmopolitan ones.&lt;ref name="taruskin42"/&gt; This was not due to any social or political agenda implicit in the art, but due to the Russianness of the art itself.&lt;ref name="taruskin42"&gt;Taruskin, 42.&lt;/ref&gt; This included the music of the composers Belyayev chose to support.&lt;ref name="taruskin42"/&gt;

An amateur [[viola]] player and [[chamber music]] enthusiast, Belyayev hosted "[[string quartet|quartet]] Fridays" at his home in St. Petersburg. A frequent visitor to these gatherings was Rimsky-Korsakov.&lt;ref&gt;Maes, 172–173.&lt;/ref&gt; Belyayev became a music patron after he had heard the [[Symphony No. 1 (Glazunov)|First Symphony]] by the sixteen-year-old Glazunov, who had been discovered by Balakirev and tutored by Rimsky-Korsakov in musical composition, [[counterpoint]] and orchestration. Not only did Glazunov become a fixture of the "quartet Fridays", but Belyayev also published Glazunov's work and took him on a tour of Western Europe. This tour included a visit to [[Weimar]], [[Germany]] to present the young composer to famed Hungarian composer and pianist [[Franz Liszt]].&lt;ref name="maes192"&gt;Maes, 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon Belyayev became interested in other Russian composers. In 1884 he set up an annual [[Glinka prize]], named after pioneer Russian composer [[Mikhail Glinka]] (1804–1857). In 1885 he founded his own music publishing firm, based in [[Leipzig]], Germany, through which he published works by Glazunov, Rimsky-Korsakov, Lyadov and Borodin at his own expense.&lt;ref name="maes173"/&gt; By publishing in Leipzig, Belyayev could offer the double benefit of higher quality music printing than was available in Russia at the time, plus the protection of international [[copyright]] which Russia did not offer.&lt;ref name="taruskin49"/&gt; At Rimsky-Korsakov's suggestion, Belyayev also founded his own concert series, the [[Russian Symphony Concerts]], open exclusively to Russian composers. Among the works written especially for this series were the three by Rimsky-Korsakov by which he is currently best known in the West—''[[Scheherazade]]'', the ''[[Russian Easter Festival Overture]]'' and ''[[Capriccio espagnol]]''. To select which composers to assist with money, publication or performances from the many who now appealed for help, Belyayev set up an advisory council made up of Glazunov, Lyadov and Rimsky-Korsakov. They would look through the compositions and appeals submitted and suggest which composers were deserving of patronage and public attention.&lt;ref name="maes173"&gt;Maes, 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
The musical scene in St. Petersburg came to be dominated by the Belyayev circle since Rimsky-Korsakov had taught many of its members at the Conservatory there. Since Glazunov, Lyadov and Rimsky-Korsakov acted in an advisory capacity to the Belyayev enterprises, and thus became channels of Belyayev's largesse,&lt;ref name="taruskin56"/&gt; composers who wished to be part of this circle and who desired Belyayev's patronage had to write in a musical style approved by these three men.&lt;ref name="maes173"/&gt; Because of this stricture, Rimsky-Korsakov's style became the preferred academic style—one that young composers had to follow if they hoped to have any sort of career.&lt;ref name="maes173"&gt;Maes, 173.&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, the Belyayev circle acted as a compositional [[guild]].&lt;ref name="taruskin56"/&gt; The better pupils from the St. Petersburg Conservatory received initiation by their invitation to the "quartet Fridays", and admission to the circle "guaranteed well remunerated publication by Edition Belieff, Leipzig, and performance in the Russian Symphony Concert programs".&lt;ref name="taruskin56"&gt;Taruskin, 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the Belyayev circle "set up an establishment that governed all aspects of musical creation, education and performance".&lt;ref name="taruskin56"/&gt;

==Philosophy==
The Belyayev circle ran counter in its philosophy to the artistic movement and magazine ''[[Mir iskusstva]]'' ({{lang-ru|«Мир иску́сства»}}, ''World of Art''). ''Mir iskusstva'' "identified with the artistic values of the [Russian] aristocracy" in its cosmopolitanism and belief of a universal culture.&lt;ref&gt;Figes, 268–269.&lt;/ref&gt; The composers of the Belyayev circle, like the Five before it, believed in a national, realist form of Russian classical music that should stand apart in its style and characteristics from Western European classical music. In this sense, the Belyayev composers shared similar goals with the [[Abramtsevo Colony]] and [[Russian Revival architecture|Russian Revival]] in the sphere of fine arts. Another way ''Mir iskusstva'' disagreed with the Belyayev circle was that they believed the composers under Belyayev were practicing art for art's sake, much like a social program. This practice ran counter to their belief in focusing on "art as the spiritual expression of the individual's creative genius", as they felt [[Alexander Pushkin]] had done in his poetry and Tchaikovsky in his music.&lt;ref&gt;Figes, 269.&lt;/ref&gt; Alfred Nurok commented in an 1899 review in ''Mir iskusstva'':

{{quote|Mr. Belyayev's [[Gaius Maecenas|Maecenas]] activities bear a very special imprint. His undeniably lavish patronage of Russian music of the newest variety does not, unfortunately, so much facilitate the development of the talents of gifted but as yet unrecognized composers, as it encourages young people who have successfully completed their conservatory course to cultivate productivity come what may, touching little upon the question of their creative abilities. Mr. Belyayev encourages industry above all, and under his [[aegis]] musical composition has assumed the character of a workers' collective (''[[artel]]''), or even a crafts industry.|&lt;ref&gt;As cited in Maes, 173.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Musicologist [[Richard Taruskin]] writes, "Within the Belyayev circle a safe conformism became increasingly the rule".&lt;ref name="taruskin57"&gt;Taruskin, 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Concert programs needed to be filled with new Russian works, and new works had to be published to offer to the music public. It was therefore necessary "to dip rather deep into the pool of available Conservatory trained talent", and the circle became known for the number of less-than-first-rate talents harbored within it.&lt;ref name="taruskin57"/&gt; Critic and composer [[César Cui]], who had been part of the Five along with Rimsky-Korsakov, derisively called these younger composers "clones".&lt;ref name="taruskin57"/&gt; Though there was some snobbism involved in criticism of the Belyayev circle, there was also enough truth in the issue of conformism to cause the circle some embarrassment.&lt;ref name="taruskin57"/&gt;
A contributing factor to this conformism was the gradual academization of composers in the nationalist circle, fueled by Rimsky-Korsakov's efforts in this regard with his students.&lt;ref name="mfw21403"&gt;Frolova-Walker, ''New Grove (2001)'', 21:403.&lt;/ref&gt; An increasing number of these students joined the Belyayev circle; the result was "the emergence of production-line 'Russian style' pieces, polished and correct, but lacking originality".&lt;ref name="mfw21403"/&gt;

==Comparison to the Five==
[[File:Glazunov by Repin.jpg|thumb|alt=A young man with reddish hair wearing a dark suit|Portrait of [[Alexander Glazunov]] by [[Ilya Repin]], 1887]]

The composers who formed the Belyayev circle were nationalistic in their outlook, as were the Five before them. Like the Five, they believed in a uniquely Russian style of classical music that utilized folk music and exotic melodic, harmonic and rhythmic elements, as exemplified by the music of Balakirev, Borodin and Rimsky-Korsakov. Unlike the Five, these composers also believed in the necessity of an academic, Western-based background in composition. The necessity of Western compositional techniques was something that Rimsky-Korsakov had instilled in many of them in his years at the St. Petersburg Conservatory.&lt;ref name="maes192"/&gt; Compared to the "revolutionary" composers in Balakirev's circle, Rimsky-Korsakov found those in the Belyayev circle to be "progressive ... attaching as it did great importance to technical perfection, but ... also broke new paths, though more securely, even if less speedily...."&lt;ref name="rk286"&gt;Rimsky-Korsakov, 286–287.&lt;/ref&gt;

Glazunov's attitude toward outside influences was typical of the Belyayev circle. He studied Tchaikovsky's works and "found much that was new ... that was instructive for us as young musicians. It struck me that Tchaikovsky, who was above all a lyrical and melodic composer, had introduced operatic elements into his symphonies. I admired the thematic material of his works less than the inspired unfolding of his thoughts, his temperament and the constructural perfection."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Lobanova, 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Rimsky-Korsakov noted "a tendency toward [[eclecticism]]" among the composers in the Belyayev circle, as well as a "predilection ... for Italian-French music of the time of wig and [[farthingale]] [that is, the eighteenth century], music introduced by Tchaikovsky in his ''[[The Queen of Spades (opera)|Queen of Spades]]'' and ''[[Iolanthe (Tchaikovsky)|Iolanthe]]''".&lt;ref&gt;Rimsky-Korsakov, 309.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, while the Belyayev circle was more tolerant of outside influence to a certain degree than their predecessors under Balakirev,&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz, ''New Grove (1980)'', 7:428.&lt;/ref&gt; they still followed the compositional practices of the Five closely. Maes writes, "The harmonies of [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]]'s coronation scene in ''[[Boris Godunov (opera)|Boris]]'', the [[octatonic scale|octatonicism]] of ''[[Mlada (Rimsky-Korsakov)|Mlada]]'' and ''[[Sadko (opera)|Sadko]]'', Balakirev's folk-song stylizations, Rimsky-Korsakov's colorful [[harmony|harmonization]]—all these served as a store of recipes for writing Russian national music. In the portrayal of the national character ... these techniques prevailed over the subjects portrayed".&lt;ref name="maes192"/&gt;

==Folklorism, orientalism, "fantastic" style==
Unlike their predecessors in the Five, composers in the Belyayev circle did not concern themselves greatly with [[fakelore|folklorism]]—the invention or adaptation of [[folklore]] to newly written stories or songs, or to folklore that is reworked and modified for modern tastes. They also did not travel to other parts of Russia to actively search for folk songs, as Balakirev had done. When the Belyayev composers produced folkloric works, "they simply imitated Balakirev's or Rimsky-Korsakov's styles".&lt;ref&gt;Maes, 192–193.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the Belyayev composers, [[Mikhail Ippolitov-Ivanov]], continued the Five's work in musical [[orientalism]]—the use of exotic melodic, harmonic and rhythmic elements to depict the middle- and far-eastern parts of the [[Russian Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Figes, 390–391; Maes, 80–83.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote three operas set in an oriental background and composed in Balakirev's style—''Ruth'', ''Azra'' and ''Izmena''. The story for the last of these operas "deals with the struggle between Christians and Muslims during the sixteenth-century occupation of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] by the Persians".&lt;ref name="maes193"&gt;Maes, 193.&lt;/ref&gt; Ippolotov-Ivanov is best known in the West for his two sets of ''[[Caucasian Sketches]]'' "an orientalist orchestral work modeled on Balakirev and Borodin".&lt;ref name="maes193"/&gt;

Lyadov wrote in a "fantastic" vein akin to Rimsky-Korsakov's, especially in his tone poems based on Russian fairy tales, ''Baba Yaga'', ''Kikimora'' and ''The Enchanted Lake''.&lt;ref name="maes192"&gt;Maes, 192.&lt;/ref&gt; This style of musical writing was based on extensive use of the [[whole tone scale]] and the [[octatonic scale]] to depict supernatural or magical characters and events, hence the term "fantastic".&lt;ref&gt;Maes, 83–84.&lt;/ref&gt; Though he would break from the Belyayev aesthetic in subsequent works, [[Igor Stravinsky]] wrote his [[Ballet (music)|ballet]] ''[[The Firebird]]'' in a similar musical style.&lt;ref&gt;Maes, 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intolerance of non-compliant composers==
[[File:Young Rachmaninoff 2.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A clean-shaven young man with close-cropped hair, wearing a dark jacket, dress shirt with a high stiff collar and tie, looking toward the viewer with one hand on the side of his head|Sergei Rachmaninoff]]

Despite Rimsky-Korsakov's denial of bias among composers of the Belyayev circle,&lt;ref name="rk286"/&gt; musicologist [[Solomon Volkov]] mentions that they and the Five shared a mutual suspicion of compositions that did not follow its canon.&lt;ref name="volkov350"&gt;Volkov, ''St. Petersburg'', 350.&lt;/ref&gt; This proved especially true of the [[Symphony No. 1 (Rachmaninoff)|First Symphony]] of [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], a Moscow composer and protege of Tchaikovsky. Rimsky-Korsakov, whose own musical preferences in his later years were not overly progressive,&lt;ref&gt;Maes, 180—181.&lt;/ref&gt; may have sounded an advance warning on hearing the symphony in rehearsal when he told Rachmaninoff, "Forgive me, but I do not find this music at all agreeable".&lt;ref&gt;Bertenssohn and Leyva, 71.&lt;/ref&gt; By the reports of many present, the rehearsal that Rimsky-Korsakov had heard, conducted by Glazunov, was both a disaster as a performance and a horrific travesty of the score.&lt;ref name="har76"&gt;Harrison, 76.&lt;/ref&gt; The premiere, held in St. Petersburg on March 28, 1897, went no better. Cui wrote in his review of the work, among other things, "If there were a [[College or university school of music|conservatory]] in [[Hell]], and if one of its talented students were to compose a programme symphony based on the story of the [[Plagues of Egypt|Ten Plagues of Egypt]], and if he were to compose a symphony like Mr. Rachmaninoff's, then he would have fulfilled his task brilliantly and would delight the inhabitants of Hell".&lt;ref&gt;Cui, Ts., "Tretiy russkiy simfonicheskiy kontsert," ''Novosti i birzhevaya gazeta'' (17 March 1897(o.s.), 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The symphony was not performed again in Rachmaninoff's lifetime,&lt;ref&gt;Bertenssohn and Leyva, 74.&lt;/ref&gt; and while Rachmaninoff did not destroy or disavow the score, he suffered a psychological collapse that led to a three-year creative hiatus.&lt;ref&gt;Bertenssohn and Leyva, 144–145; Norris, ''Rachmaninoff'', 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modernism==
Maes writes that the composers who formed the Belyayev circle have often been described as "important links to, and pathbreakers for" modernist Russian composers such as Stravinsky and [[Sergei Prokofiev]]. This, he asserts, is actually a false assumption which suggests that modernism was the result of a gradual process.&lt;ref name="maes195"&gt;Maes, 195.&lt;/ref&gt; The truth, Maes suggests, was that modernist music in Russia was a much more radical break from the Belyayev circle than many have claimed.&lt;ref name="maes195"/&gt; Rimsky-Korsakov's extensive use of the [[octatonic scale]] and other harmonic experiments "was a gold mine for those bent on a modernist revolution," Maes writes. "However, the renewing force had still to be liberated from the cliches and routines into which the Belyayev aesthetic had been pressed".&lt;ref name="maes195"/&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Dmitrij Dmitrijevič Šostakovič (Дми́трий Дми́триевич Шостако́вич).jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A young man wearing round-framed glasses, a dark jacket, tie and dress shirt|Dmitri Shostakovich, 1925]]

Bias toward the musical aesthetics practiced by the Belyayev circle would continue at the St. Petersburg Conservatory after Rimsky-Korsakov's retirement in 1906,&lt;ref&gt;Taruskin, 73.&lt;/ref&gt; with his son-in-law [[Maximilian Steinberg]] in charge of composition classes at the Conservatory through the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] would complain about Steinberg's musical conservatism, typified by such phrases as "the inviolable foundations of the ''kuchka''" and the "sacred traditions of Nikolai Andreyevich [Rimsky-Korsakov]".&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Shostakovich to Tatyana Glivenko dated February 26, 1924. As quoted in Fay, 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Nor was this traditionalism limited to St. Petersburg. Well into the Soviet era, many other music conservatories remained run by traditionalists such as Ippolitov-Ivanov in Moscow and [[Reinhold Glière]] in [[Petro Tchaikovsky National Music Academy of Ukraine|Kiev]]. Because of these individuals, Maes writes, "the conservatories retained a direct link with the Belyayev aesthetic".&lt;ref&gt;Maes, 244.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bezerenbam''' (or '''Bazaram-bam''') and '''Mişelav''' were the [[Wallachia]]n (Romanian) leaders&lt;ref name="Xenopol, p. 552"&gt;Xenopol, p. 552.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Djuvara, cited article"&gt;Djuvara, cited article.&lt;/ref&gt; (the former a "[[Ban (title)|ban]]" according to Xenopol, Hasdeu and Constantin C. Giurescu) mentioned in 1241, in the Persian chronicle [[Jami' al-tawarikh|Jāmiʿ al-Tawārīkh]] written by [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani]] (Fazel-Ullah-Raschid). They appear in the context of the [[Mongol invasion of Europe]]. The former's army was located in ''Ilaut country'', as the chronicle says:

:''In the middle of the spring (1240), the princes crossed the (...) mountains to enter in the country of Bulars and Bashguirds. Orda, who marched on the right, passing through Ilaut country, met (Bezerenbam?) with an army; the latter has been defeated. Cardan and Buri went against the Sassans,&lt;ref&gt;"They were probably the [[Transylvanian Saxons|Saxons]] who were living in the Eastern provinces of Hungary, and were attacked by prince Cardan." (author's note)&lt;/ref&gt; and  defeated them after three battles. Budjek crossed the mountains of that country in order to enter in Cara-Ulag (probably [[Transylvania]] and [[Wallachia]]), defeated the Ulags ([[Vlachs]]), crossed the (...) mountains, and entered in the country of (Mişelav?), where he beat the awaiting enemy.''.&lt;ref&gt;[[d'Ohsson]] p. 627 - 628.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his work, ''History of the Romanians'', [[Alexandru D. Xenopol]] considers that it is possible for Bezerenbam, or Basarab the [[Ban (title)|ban]],&lt;ref&gt;Xenopol, p. 531.&lt;/ref&gt; to be the same person as [[Litovoi]], mentioned in a document from 1247 as ruler of the same [[Oltenia|land]].&lt;ref name="Xenopol, p. 552"/&gt; He considers Bazaram-bam is an ancestor of the Romanian dynasty of Basarab &lt;ref&gt;Les Roumains au moyen-age: une énigme historique By Alexandru Dimitrie Xenopol, Publisher: Paris, E. Leroux, 1885 OCLC Number:	4153032&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu]] also thinks that the leader was "Basarab the [[Ban (title)|ban]]", a local leader, while [[Constantin C. Giurescu]] considers that this name was a distorted form of the title of [[Banat of Severin|Ban of Severin]] (Terra Zeurino).&lt;ref&gt;Giurescu, p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neagu Djuvara]] has considered the possibility that Mişelav was [[Seneslau]],&lt;ref name="Djuvara, cited article"/&gt; another Wallachian leader contemporary with and neighbouring Litovoi.

[[File:Soviet Union-1964-stamp-Chapayev (film).jpg|thumb|230px|''[[Chapaev (film)|Chapaev]]'']]
A '''biographical film''', or '''biopic''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|aɪ|əʊ|p|ɪ|k}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forvo.com/word/biopic/#en|title=biopic pronunciation: How to pronounce biopic in English, German|first=Forvo|last=Team|date=|website=forvo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; abbreviation for ''biographical motion picture''), is a film that dramatizes the life of a [[non-fictional]] or [[historically]]-based person or people. Such films show the life of a historical person and the central character's real name is used.&lt;ref name=bas2009&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bastin|first=Giselle|title=Filming the Ineffable: Biopics of the British Royal Family|journal=Auto/Biography Studies|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/abs/summary/v024/24.1.bastin.html|date=Summer 2009|volume=24|issue=1|pages=34–52|accessdate=29 May 2013|doi=10.1353/abs.2009.0008}}&lt;/ref&gt; They differ from films "[[docudrama|based on a true story]]" or "[[historical drama film]]s" in that they attempt to comprehensively tell a single person's life story or at least the most historically important years of their lives.{{Original research inline|date=October 2015}}

Because the figures portrayed are actual people, whose actions and characteristics are known to the public (or at least historically documented), biopic roles are considered some of the most demanding of actors and actresses.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} [[Ben Kingsley]], [[Johnny Depp]], [[Jim Carrey]], and [[Jamie Foxx]] all gained new-found respect as dramatic actors after starring in biopics:{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Ben Kingsley as [[Mahatma Gandhi]] in ''[[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]]'' (1982), Depp as [[Ed Wood]] in ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]'' (1994), Carrey as [[Andy Kaufman]] in ''[[Man on the Moon (film)|Man on the Moon]]'' (1999), and Foxx as [[Ray Charles]] in ''[[Ray (film)|Ray]]'' (2004).

In rare cases, sometimes called '''auto biopics''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/autobiopic|title=autobiopic - definition of autobiopic in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; the subject of the film plays himself or herself: [[Jackie Robinson]] in ''[[The Jackie Robinson Story]]''; [[Muhammad Ali]] in ''[[The Greatest (1977 film)|The Greatest]]''; [[Audie Murphy]] in ''[[To Hell and Back (film)|To Hell and Back]]''; [[Patty Duke]] in ''[[Call Me Anna (film)|Call Me Anna]]''; [[Bob Mathias]] in ''[[The Bob Mathias Story]]'', [[Arlo Guthrie]] in ''[[Alice's Restaurant (film)|Alice's Restaurant]]''; [[Fantasia Barrino]] in ''[[Life Is Not a Fairytale: The Fantasia Barrino Story|Life Is Not a Fairytale]]''; and [[Howard Stern]] in ''[[Private Parts (1997 film)|Private Parts]]''.

Biopic scholars include [[George F. Custen]] of the [[College of Staten Island]] and [[Dennis P. Bingham]] of [[Indiana University – Purdue University Indianapolis]]. Custen, in ''Bio/Pics: How Hollywood Constructed Public History'' (1992), regards the genre as having died with the [[Studio system|Hollywood studio era]], and in particular, [[Darryl F. Zanuck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Custen |first=George F. |title=Bio/pics : how Hollywood constructed public history |page= |publisher=Rutgers University Press |date=1992 |oclc=24247491 |isbn=9780813517551 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, Bingham's 2010 study ''Whose Lives Are They Anyway? The Biopic as Contemporary Film Genre''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bingham |first=Dennis |title=Whose Lives Are They Anyway? The Biopic as Contemporary Film Genre |page= |publisher=Rutgers University Press |date=2010 |oclc=318970570 |isbn=9780813546582}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows how it perpetuates as a codified genre using many of the same tropes used in the studio era that has followed a similar trajectory as that shown by [[Rick Altman]] in his study, ''[[Film/Genre]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Film/genre |last=Altman |first=Rick |year=1999 |publisher=British Film Institute |page= |oclc=41071380 |isbn=9780851707174 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bingham also addresses the male biopic and the female biopic as distinct genres from each other, the former generally dealing with great accomplishments, the latter generally dealing with female victimization. Ellen Cheshire's ''Bio-Pics: a life in pictures'' (2014) examines UK/US films from the 1990s and 2000s. Each chapter reviews key films linked by profession and concludes with further viewing list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cheshire |first=Ellen |title=Bio-Pics: a life in pictures |page= |publisher=Columbia University Press |date=2014 |oclc= |isbn=9780231172059 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher Robé has also written on the gender norms that underlie the biopic in his article, "Taking Hollywood Back" in the 2009 issue of ''Cinema Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Robé |first=Christopher |title=Taking Hollywood Back: The Historical Costume Drama, the Biopic, and Popular Front U.S. Film Criticism |jstor=20484449 |journal=Cinema Journal |volume=48 |issue=2 |date=Winter 2009 |pages=70–87 |doi=10.1353/cj.0.0082}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{Anchor|Ebert}} [[Roger Ebert]] defended ''The Hurricane'' and distortions in biographical films in general, stating "those who seek the truth about a man from the film of his life might as well seek it from his loving grandmother. ... ''The Hurricane'' is not a [[Documentary film|documentary]] but a [[parable]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Roger |last=Ebert |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-hurricane-2000 |date=January 7, 2000 |title=The Hurricane |newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anchor|stretch}} Some biopics purposely stretch the truth. ''[[Confessions of a Dangerous Mind]]'' was based on [[game show]] host [[Chuck Barris]]' widely debunked yet popular [[memoir]] of the same name, in which he claimed to be a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,404266,00.html|title=Chuck Barris: Lying to Tell the Truth |last=Stein |first=Joel |date=2003-01-07 |newspaper=Time |issn=0040-781X |access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Kafka (film)|Kafka]]'' incorporated both the life of author [[Franz Kafka]] and the [[surrealism|surreal]] aspects of his fiction.{{citation needed|date=June 2010}} The [[Errol Flynn]] film ''[[They Died with Their Boots On]]'' tells the story of [[George Armstrong Custer|Custer]] but is highly romanticized. The [[Oliver Stone]] film ''[[The Doors (film)|The Doors]]'', mainly about [[Jim Morrison]], was highly praised for the similarities between Jim Morrison and actor [[Val Kilmer]], look-wise and singing-wise, but fans and band members did not like the way Val Kilmer portrayed Jim Morrison,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gary James' Interview with Ray Manzarek |url= http://www.classicbands.com/RayManzarekInterview.html |publisher=Classicbands |accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a few of the scenes were even completely made up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.crystal-ship.com/entrevues.php?cht=03 |title=Chat with Ray Manzarek |publisher=Crystal-ship|date=17 November 1997 |accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Casting can be controversial for biographical films. Casting is often a balance between similarity in looks and ability to portray the characteristics of the person. [[Anthony Hopkins]] felt that he should not have played [[Richard Nixon]] in ''[[Nixon (film)|Nixon]]'' because of a lack of resemblance between the two.{{citation needed|date=June 2010}} The casting of [[John Wayne]] as [[Genghis Khan]] in ''[[The Conqueror (1956 film)|The Conqueror]]'' was objected to because of the American Wayne being cast as the Mongol warlord. Egyptian critics criticized the casting of [[Louis Gossett, Jr.]], an African American actor, as Egyptian president [[Anwar Sadat]] in the 1982 TV miniseries ''[[Sadat (film)|Sadat]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/02/movies/upset-by-sadat-egypt-bars-columbia-films.html|title=UPSET BY 'SADAT,' EGYPT BARS COLUMBIA FILMS|last=Times|first=Judith Miller, Special To The New York|date=1984-02-02|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, some objected to the casting of [[Jennifer Lopez]] in ''[[Selena (film)|Selena]]'' because she is a New York City native of [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] descent while [[Selena]] was [[Mexican-American]].&lt;ref&gt;Tracy, Kathleen (2008).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3344">The '''Blue Sky Rangers''' is a group of [[Intellivision]] game programmers who previously worked for [[Mattel]] in the early 1980s.

When the Intellivision first came out in 1978, its games were all developed by an outside firm, [[APh Technological Consulting]]. Realizing that potential profits are much greater with [[first party software]], Mattel formed its own in-house software development group. The original five members of that Intellivision team were manager [[Gabriel Baum]], [[Don Daglow]], [[Rick Levine]], [[Mike Minkoff]] and [[John Sohl]]. Levine and Minkoff (a long-time Mattel Toys veteran) both came over from the hand-held Mattel games engineering team.  To keep these and later programmers (the Mattel team peaked at 110 people in 1983) from being hired away by rival [[Atari]], their identity and work location was kept a closely guarded secret.

In 1982, ''[[TV Guide]]'' published an article about Intellivision's secret programming team. The writer of the article wanted to come up with some group name other than "The Application Software Programmers," so he came up with the name "The Blue Sky Rangers." This was based on the programming group's "Blue Sky Meetings," which were a series of brainstorming sessions for new game ideas.&lt;ref name="TVGuide" /&gt;

This name stuck and the programmers were (and still are) collectively referred to as the Blue Sky Rangers. One of the early programmers, Keith Robinson, re-acquired the rights to Intellivision in recent years and the Blue Sky Rangers' games are now available on a variety of computers and video game platforms, as well as [[mobile phones]]. Rights are currently held by Tommy Tallarico.&lt;ref name="Techspot"&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Video game music veteran Tommy Tallarico acquires Intellivision rights from Mattel | first = Jeffrey | last  = Cal | date  = May 29, 2018 | magazine = [[Techspot]] | url   = https://www.techspot.com/news/74844-video-game-music-veteran-tommy-tallarico-acquires-intellivision.html | accessdate = August 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bolton 7''' were a group of [[gay]] and [[bisexual]] men who were convicted on 12 January 1998 before Judge Michael Lever at [[Bolton]] Crown Court of the offences of gross indecency under the [[Sexual Offences Act 1956]] and of [[age of consent]] offences under the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]]. Although [[Gay sexual practices|gay sex]] was partially decriminalised by the [[Sexual Offences Act 1967]], they were all convicted under section 13 of the 1956 Act because more than two men had sex together, which was still illegal. One of the participants (Craig Turner) was also six months under the statutory [[age of consent]] for [[Gay sexual practices|gay sex]] which was 18 at the time. 

==Offences==
Under the provisions of the 1967 Act, the [[age of consent]] for [[Gay sexual practices|gay sex]] was different from that of the [[heterosexual]] [[age of consent]] of 16, and had only been reduced from 21 to 18 by the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]]. Equivalent [[heterosexual]] behaviour was not a crime.&lt;ref name=Dearden1999 &gt;{{Cite journal | last = Dearden | first = Nick | title = The Queen and the 'Bolton Seven' | journal = [[Feminist Legal Studies]] | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 317-332 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | doi = 10.1023/A:1009218800557 | date = October 1999 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1009218800557 | quote= This note examines the case of a group of gay men who, having engaged in consensual sexual acts together, became known as the `Bolton Seven’ following their conviction in 1998 for offences of buggery and/or gross indecency. More particularly the note scrutinises the implications of the ages of the participants (one of whom, at 17 , was unable to give lawful consent to sexual intercourse with a man) in the light of the enactment of Part I of the Sex Offenders Act 1997 which introduces a system of compulsory registration by some convicted and cautioned sex offenders with the police (including men convicted of, or cautioned for, buggery or gross indecency). The note explores the justification for inclusion of these offences within the remit of the 1997 Act together with the cultural construction of gay men as predatory and as constituting a risk to younger members of society. It also analyses some of the effects of the registration requirement in terms of it constituting a potential violation of fundamental rights such as equality and respect for private life. This discussion is located particularly within the context of the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights and the introduction of the Human Rights Act 1998 in the U.K. | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The offences only came to light after police seized videos of the men having sex, which they had filmed for their own personal use. All the men were either lovers, ex-boyfriends, or friends of friends.

==Sentences==
During [[Sentence (law)|sentencing]] on 20 February 1998 Gary Abdie, David Godfrey, Mark Love and Jonathan Moore (all of whom were in their early 20s), and Craig Turner (17 at the time of the offences but 18 when he appeared in court) were given [[probation]] and [[community service]] orders. The Judge gave Norman Williams a two-year [[suspended sentence|suspended prison sentence]] and Terry Connell received a nine-month suspended sentence and was ordered to pay £500 towards the cost of the prosecution. Moore (20), Williams (33) and Connell (55) were also required to sign the Sex Offenders Register for the [[age of consent]] offences committed with Turner. Estimates of the overall cost of the prosecution were in the region of £500,000.

Despite their convictions, none of them received custodial sentences possibly as a  result of a high-profile campaign led by gay [[human rights]] group [[OutRage!]]. Over 400 letters were presented to the court in support of the men including those from MPs, Bishops and [[human rights]] groups. The letters urged the judge not to impose a custodial sentence, with one group, [[Amnesty International]], pledging to declare the men prisoners of conscience should they be imprisoned.

==Aftermath==
In 2000, six of the men appealed to the [[European Court of Human Rights]] arguing that the prosecutions against them had violated their rights under the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] by interfering with 'the right to respect for a private family life' enshrined in article 8  of the Convention. They were subsequently awarded compensation. As Williams was not part of the litigation, he was not deemed eligible by the Home Office for the compensation.

Legislation subsequently introduced by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] Government has broadly equalised the treatment of [[homosexual]] and [[heterosexual]] behaviours in criminal law. The [[Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000]] equalised the [[age of consent]] for [[Gay sexual practices|gay sex]] with that of the [[heterosexual]] [[age of consent]] which is now 16 for both. The [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]], though subject to some controversy, introduced an overhaul in the way sexual offences are dealt with by the police and courts, replacing provisions that date as far back to the 1956 legislation. The offences of gross indecency and [[buggery]] have been repealed and sexual activity between more than two men is no longer a [[crime in the United Kingdom]].

In the creation and criticism of fictional works, a '''character flaw''' is a limitation, imperfection, problem, [[phobia]], or deficiency present in a character who may be otherwise very functional. The flaw can be a problem that directly affects the character's actions and abilities, such as a violent temper. Alternatively, it can be a simple foible or personality defect, which affects the character's motives and social interactions, but little else.

Flaws can add depth and humanity to the characters in a [[narrative]].  For example, the sheriff with a gambling addiction, the [[action hero]] who is afraid of heights, or a lead in a [[romantic comedy]] who must overcome his insecurity regarding male pattern baldness are all characters whose flaws help provide dimension.  Perhaps the most widely cited and classic of character flaws is [[Achilles]]' famous heel.

In general, flaws can be categorized as ''minor'', ''major'', or ''tragic''.

==Minor flaw==
A minor character flaw is an imperfection which serves to distinguish the character in the mind of the reader / viewer / player / listener, making them memorable and individual, but otherwise does not affect the story in any way.

Examples of this could include a noticeable scar, a thick accent or a habit such as cracking their knuckles.

[[Protagonists]] and other major characters may (and usually do) have multiple minor flaws, making them more accessible, and enabling the reader / viewer / listener to relate to the character (in the case of a [[sympathetic character]]) or otherwise influence the audience's opinions of the character.

Many insignificant or archetypal characters which are encountered only once or rarely are defined solely by a single minor flaw, differentiating them from the [[stock character]] or [[archetype]] that they adhere to.

==Major flaw==
A major character flaw is a much more noticeable and important hindrance which actually impairs the individual, whether physically, mentally or morally. Sometimes major flaws are not actually negative per se (such as devout religious beliefs or a rigid code of honor), but are classified as such in that they often serve to hinder or restrict the character in some way.

Examples of this type of flaw could include blindness, [[amnesia]] or greed.

Unlike minor flaws, major flaws are almost invariably important to either the character's, or the story's development.

*For villains, their major flaw is usually the cause of their eventual downfall.
*For heroes, their major flaw usually must be overcome (either temporarily or permanently) at some point in the story, often at the climax, by their own determination or skill.
*For neutral characters, or those that shift allegiance, the major flaw is usually the cause of either their corruption, redemption or both.
*For the protagonist, the most visible flaw generally serves a more vital interest, as well, as it defines his or her core problem.  It is the protagonist's reluctant (and usually unconscious) journey to address this problem that forms the spine of the story, sometimes acting as the [[MacGuffin]] to stimulate the plot.

==Tragic/fatal flaw==
This is a specific sort of flaw, also known as "[[Hamartia]]", which is possessed by Aristotelian [[tragic hero]]s. It is a flaw which causes an otherwise noble or exceptional character to bring about their own downfall and, often, their eventual death.

Examples of this could include [[hubris]], misplaced trust, excessive curiosity, pride and lack of self-control.

This fall usually occurs at the beginning of a story, with the story itself concentrates on the consequences or attempted redemption of the fall.

== Examples ==

===Literature===
*[[Oedipus|Oedipus's]] downfall is directly linked to arrogance: ''[[Oedipus Rex]]''
*Macbeth suffers from [[hubris]], leading to the murder of [[Duncan I of Scotland]]; he later becomes [[paranoia|paranoid]], leading him to order the deaths of [[Banquo]] and the family of [[Macduff (Macbeth)|Macduff]]: ''[[Macbeth]]''
*[[Hamlet]] is indecisive and self-doubting, which thwarts him in avenging his father's murder.
*[[Victor Frankenstein]] suffers from excessive curiosity and irresponsibility, leading to the creation of the [[Frankenstein's monster|monster]] that destroys his life: ''[[Frankenstein]]''
*[[Sigurd]] has a vulnerable spot on his back, where a linden leaf fell as he was bathing in dragon's blood: ''[[Volsunga saga]]'' 
*[[Agamemnon]] acts in greed when he takes [[Briseis]] away from [[Achilles]], losing the warrior's support in the [[Trojan War]]: ''[[The Iliad]]''. Achilles's own flaw was his own arrogance.
*[[Odysseus|Odysseus's]] flaw was an extreme [[Hubris (Ancient Greece)|hubris]] which led him to dishonor the god [[Poseidon]]. (''[[The Odyssey]]'')
*[[Cyrano De Bergerac]], despite his many accomplishments, suffers from self-doubt because of his huge nose which keeps him from pursuing the woman he loves.
*[[Marvin the Paranoid Android]] suffers from extreme depression, as well as extreme boredom due to his huge yet mostly inactive mind: ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''
*[[Tom Riddle|Tom Riddle's]] extreme [[thanatophobia]] eventually transformed him into the vile Lord Voldemort in his pursuit for [[immortality]]. (''[[Harry Potter]]'')
*[[Harry Potter]]'s worst flaws, as stated by Rowling, are "anger and occasional arrogance." However, within the text, it is implied his flaw might be his heroic desire to save people. (''[[Harry Potter]]'')
*[[Percy Jackson]] has a fatal flaw of excessive personal loyalty, while his girlfriend Annabeth Chase shares the flaw of the legendary Odysseus: hubris. (''[[Percy Jackson and the Olympians]]'')
*[[Jo March]]'s bluntness and hot temper cause conflict with her family. ''[[Little Women]]''
*In the ''[[Star Wars Expanded Universe|Star Wars Legends]]'' continuity, [[Jacen Solo|Jacen Solo's]] eventual downfall is linked to his placing the weight of the galaxy on his shoulder in his desire for peace.

===Film===
*In ''[[Rocky]]'', [[Rocky Balboa]] thinks of himself as a loser who cannot go the distance in the boxing ring.
*[[Anakin Skywalker]]'s anger and fear of losing his wife [[Padme Amidala|Padme]] eventually consumes him, leading to his transformation into [[Darth Vader]]. Whereas his mentor [[Obi-Wan Kenobi|Obi-Wan Kenobi's]] compassion and love for his student blinded him to the path Skywalker was taking. (''[[Star Wars]]'')
*In ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'', Rick thinks of himself as an unfeeling cynic who denies the pain and disappointment from a failed love affair with Ilsa.
*In ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'', the detective played by [[James Stewart]] is afraid of heights and has to climb a tower.
*[[Captain Hook]] is obsessed with ''[[Peter Pan]]''
*[[Characters in Blade Runner#Roy Batty|Roy Batty]], as a replicant, is powerful, but has a very short lifespan: ''[[Blade Runner]]''
*[[Oskar Schindler]] in the film ''[[Schindler's List]]'' must overcome his greedy nature and find compassion to sacrifice in order to save his workers

===Television===
*[[B. A. Baracus]] is afraid of flying: ''[[The A-Team]]''
*[[Homer Simpson]] is an alcoholic, not too bright and prone to reckless choices: ''[[The Simpsons]]''
*[[Philip J. Fry]] (usually) has a severe lack of intelligence: ''[[Futurama]]''
*[[Londo Mollari]] yearns to return to the "glory days" of the [[Centauri Republic]]: ''[[Babylon 5]]''
*[[Mr. Spock]] relies heavily on logic and suppresses his more human emotions: ''[[Star Trek]]''

*[[Peter Griffin]] is extremely impulsive and causes many problems for his family and friends: ''[[Family Guy]]''
*[[Zuko]] makes misguided decisions in an effort to gain his cruel father's acceptance: ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]''
*[[Aang]] is too carefree and initially attempts to run from his responsibilities rather than face them: ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]''
*[[Dean Winchester]] relies on family and is devastated when he loses them or they betray his trust: ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]''
*[[The Tenth Doctor]] is constantly trying to help and save the lives of others, and sometimes does things out of anger that have dire consequences later: ''[[Doctor Who]]''
*[[Mr. Gold|Rumplestiltskin's]] greatest character flaw was his greed, losing even those who love him over his mad desire for power. He shares this flaw with his former student and lover [[Cora Mills|Cora]]. (''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'') 
*[[Zelena (Once Upon a Time)|Zelena's]] envy of her younger half-sister [[Regina Mills]] eventually transformed her into the infamous [[Wicked Witch of the West]] as she planned to reverse time and supplant Regina. Even after this plan was thwarted, her envy remained a great character flaw throughout her time on the show. (''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'')
*After the death of her fiance Daniel Colter, [[Regina Mills|Regina]] suffered a mental breakdown and became consumed with anger, which Rumplestiltskin was able to use to shape her into the Evil Queen who would cast his Dark Curse. Anger, as a fatal flaw, is one she shares with [[Hook (Once Upon a Time)|Killian Jones]] whose own anger transformed him into vengeful [[Captain Hook]]; however, Hook did not share Regina's mental instability. (''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'')
*The main character flaw of the protagonist of the series, [[Emma Swan]], are her tendency to mistrust other people, which leads her to put up emotional barriers to protect herself and run when things get difficult. Her overcoming this flaw is a major story arc on the show. (''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'')

===Gaming===
* In [[Warhammer 40,000]], the Primarch Lorgar Aurelian is extremely devout and reveres his "father", the Emperor of Mankind, as a god. The Emperor envisages a human civilization free of the shackles of religion and dogma and chastises Lorgar and his legion for worshipping him. Hurt and depressed by the humiliation of his father's rebuke, Lorgar and the [[Space Marines (Warhammer 40,000)|Space Marines]] of the XVII Legion (the "Word Bearers") search for another purpose to sustain them, and in doing so become the first legion to fall under the malicious influence of [[Chaos (Warhammer)|Chaos]]. Their devotion to Chaos sees them instigate the devastating civil war known as the [[Horus Heresy (fictional event)|Horus Heresy]], the events of which led to the current dystopian setting of Warhammer 40,000.
*In ''[[Metal Gear Solid]]'', Liquid's jealousy of Solid Snake's "dominant genes" and his desire to be the better of the two sets much of the story in motion, leading to Liquid's eventual downfall.
*In the ''[[God of War (franchise)|God of War]]'' series, [[Kratos (God of War)|Kratos]] acts brutally and violently out of anger and desire for revenge, with devastating consequences on his only life and the world around him.

The [[blazon]] of the '''[[coat of arms]] of the [[Princess of Asturias]]''' is given by a Royal Decree 979 on 30 October 2015 which was an amendment of the Royal Decree 1511 dated [[Madrid]] 21 January 1977, which also created her guidon (military personal ensign) and her standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boletín Oficial del Estado|url=http://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2015/10/31/pdfs/BOE-A-2015-11729.pdf|accessdate=31 October 2015|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Official blazon==

The shield is divided into four quarters, blazoned as follows:

*1st, [[Gules]] a castle three-towered [[Or (heraldry)|Or]], masoned [[Sable]] ajoure, (door and windows) [[Azure (heraldry)|Azure]], for [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]];
*2nd, [[Argent]] a lion rampant Purpure crowned Or, armed Gules and crowned Or, for [[Kingdom of León|León]];
*3rd, Or four pallets Gules, for [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]];
*4th, Gules a cross, saltire and orle of chains all linked Or, an emerald Proper, for [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]];
*''Enté en point'', Argent a pomegranate Proper seeded Gules, supported, sculpted and leafed in two leaves [[Vert (heraldry)|Vert]], for [[Granada]];
*[[Inescutcheon]], Azure with three [[fleurs-de-lys]] Or, [[bordure]]d Gules, for [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]].

The whole is differenced by a [[Label (heraldry)|label]] of three points Azure, the [[brisure|difference]] used by heirs apparent to the [[House of Habsburg|Spanish House of Habsburg]].

The shield is surmounted by a closed crown, which is a circle of gold, inset with precious stones of their colours, composed of eight rosettes of acanthus leaves, of which five are visible, interspersed by pearls in their colour, issuing from which are four pearl diadems, of which three are visible, which converge in a blue orb, with gold semi-meridian and equator, surmounted by a gold cross, the crown lined with red and surrounded by the collar of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece|Golden Fleece]].

Before 2001, the heir to the Spanish throne used this coat of arms unofficially, and still does in Aragon or Navarre, where a different version of the coat of arms, as Prince or Princess of Girona and Viana respectively, is displayed. It is likely that these arms will also be some day adopted officially.&lt;ref&gt;Herrera Sánchez, Alfonso (2010).

*On sepulchres of Habsburg Princes of Asturias who didn't ascend to the throne their coats of arms are the undifferenced Lesser Royal Arms (''Quarterly, 1 and 4 [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], 2 and 3 [[Kingdom of León|León]]''), with a crown closed with four-half-arches in crest. The Pantheon of the Princes of the [[El Escorial|Royal Seat of El Escorial]] was completed in 1888, in the nineteenth century the heir to the Spanish throne used Royal Arms differentiated by a crown of four-half-arches.&lt;ref name="maribona" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Bazhe |year= |title=Royal Pantheon El Escorial |trans-title= |medium= |language= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVf7LlonKyw |accessdate=3 January 2012 |archiveurl= |archivedate= |format= |time= 8:12publisher=You Tube |location= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''coat of arms of the Prince of Wales''' is the official [[Heraldry|heraldic]] insignia of the [[Prince of Wales]], a title traditionally granted to the [[heir apparent]] to the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|reigning monarch]] of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]], formerly the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] and before that the [[Kingdom of England]].

The [[coat of arms]], in its current form, was devised for [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] in 1958. It contains the badges and elements taken from all four of the [[Countries of the United Kingdom|constituent countries of the United Kingdom]] as well as from the many [[List of titles and honours of Charles, Prince of Wales|titles the prince holds]] as [[heir apparent]].

The history of the coat of arms is closely linked with that of the [[Royal Arms of England|Royal coat of arms of England]] and the [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom]]. However, as the noted antiquarian and heraldist [[Charles Boutell]] wrote in 1863, "The Arms of the Prince of Wales have a distinct individuality of their own, with which nothing ought to be directly associated."&lt;ref name="Boutell 256"&gt;Boutell p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elements==
====Coronet====
[[File:Ströhl-Regentenkronen-Fig. 31.png|thumb|130px|left|The British heir-apparent's coronet as depicted by [[Hugo Gerard Ströhl]]]]
The [[Coronet|coronets of the Prince and the Peers]] of the realm were regulated by King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] by Royal Warrant, signed on 9 February 1661. Part of the warrant proclaimed: "Our Will and Pleasure therefore is, That the Son and Heir Apparent of the Crown for the time being, shall use and bear his Coronet composed of Crosses and [[Fleur-de-lis|Flower-de-Lized]] with one Arch; and in the midst a [[Globus cruciger|Ball and Cross]], as hath our Royal Diadem".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/prince_highness_docs.htm#The_Warrant_of_1661 |title=Warrant of Feb 9, 1661|accessdate=2018-08-10 |work=www.heraldica.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other words, the heraldic coronet used in the Prince of Wales's coat of arms is similar to the [[Crown (heraldry)|heraldic crown]] ([[St. Edward's crown]]) used in the Royal arms, except that instead of two intersecting arches it has only one. Boutell wrote that: "It should be noticed, however, that this coronet belongs to the prince as eldest son of the Sovereign and heir-apparent to the Throne, and not as Prince of Wales". The coronet is also used by the Prince of Wales's consort, in her coat of arms.&lt;ref name="Boutell 363"&gt;Boutell p. 363&lt;/ref&gt;

The heir's coronet was confirmed in another Royal Warrant signed on 19 November 1917 by King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]]. The warrant proclaimed: "by the son and heir apparent of the sovereign and his successors a coronet composed of crosses and fleurs-de-lis with one arch and in the midst a ball and cross as in the royal crown."&lt;ref name="1917 warrant"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/prince_highness_docs.htm#Warrant_of_Nov_19_1917 |title=Warrant of Nov 19, 1917|accessdate=2018-08-10 |work=www.heraldica.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently there are three physical examples of coronets used at one time or other as part of the [[Honours of the Principality of Wales]]; the [[Coronet of Frederick, Prince of Wales|Coronet of Frederick]], the [[Coronet of George, Prince of Wales|Coronet of George]] and the [[Coronet of Charles, Prince of Wales|Coronet of Charles]]. However these physical manifestations have not affected the graphical representation of the coronet in heraldic art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.royal.uk/honours-principality-wales |title=Honours of the Principality of Wales |website=www.royal.uk |access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Label====
Beginning with the reign of King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], a [[Label (heraldry)|label]] of three points [[Azure (heraldry)|Azure]] (or blue) was used by his son, the future King [[Edward II of England|Edward II]], to differentiate his arms from those of his father. Without such a label their arms would be identical. Within [[heraldry]] this system of differentiating arms is called [[cadency]]. The label is placed on the [[Chief (heraldry)|chief]] (or top) of the [[shield]] of arms, with the ends extending across from the dexter to the sinister sides of the shield. It was Prince [[Edward the Black Prince]], heir of King [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], who first used a label of three points [[Argent]], also white or silver. This has been the label of the heir apparent ever since, without regard to the system of [[Cadency labels of the British royal family|cadency used by other members]] of the royal family.&lt;ref name="Official Web"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boutell p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

====Crest====
[[File:Prince of Wales 1914.png|thumb|200px|right|Coat of arms of [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward, Prince of Wales]] as illustrated in [[Burke's Peerage]] 1914 edition.]]
The Prince of Wales's [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]] follows closely that of the Sovereign, but always with the appropriate label of [[Cadency|difference]] displayed. This crest depicts a "Lion [[Or (heraldry)|Or]], passant guardant, wearing a coronet of the Heir, and differenced on the shoulders with a label of three points Argent." The lion always stands on a larger coronet of the Heir, which then sits on a golden [[Helmet (heraldry)|helmet]] or the Royal Helm. From the sides flow the gold and [[Ermine (heraldry)|ermine]] [[mantling]] of the royal family.&lt;ref name="Official Web"/&gt;

====Supporters====
Similarly to the crest, the prince's [[supporter]]s follow those of the Sovereign. On either side of the shield of arms and standing on gold scrollwork are the royal supporters: the [[Lion and the Unicorn]]. Both beasts have the prince's label charged around their necks, again as an appropriate mark of difference. The [[Lion (heraldry)|lion]] on the [[Dexter and sinister|dexter side]], an [[National symbols of England|ancient symbol of England]], is crowned with the coronet of the Heir. The beast has been a [[Royal Supporters of England|supporter of the English royal arms]] since the reign of King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. The white [[Unicorn#Heraldry|unicorn]] of [[Scotland]] on the [[Dexter and sinister|sinister side]], was incorporated into the royal arms from the [[Royal coat of arms of Scotland|Scottish royal arms]] after the Union of the crowns in 1603.&lt;ref name="Official Web"/&gt;

====Order====
Prince Charles was appointed a [[List of current members of the Order of the Garter|Knight of the Garter]] in 1958. Since the founding of the Order in 1348, almost every Prince of Wales has been appointed to the Order.&lt;ref&gt;Boutell p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Order of the Garter]] is represented in the coat of arms by its namesake the blue buckled [[Garter (stockings)|garter]], which bears in gold letters the motto, ''[[Honi soit qui mal y pense]]'', [[French language|French]] for "Shame upon him who thinks evil of it".&lt;ref name="Official Web"/&gt;

====Motto====
Under the coat of arms is a scroll bearing the [[motto]] ''[[Ich dien]]'', German for "I serve". The motto of uncertain origin first appeared on the arms of [[Edward, the Black Prince|Edward of Woodstock]], or the Black Prince. Prince Edward was created Prince of Wales by his father King [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] on 12 May 1343. Legend holds that the Black Prince took the motto as well as the ostrich feathers from King [[John of Bohemia|John the Blind of Bohemia]], who was killed fighting alongside the prince and his father at the [[Battle of Crécy]] in 1346. The motto is also a near [[homophone]] for ''Eich Dyn'', "Your Man" in [[Welsh language|Welsh]].&lt;ref name="Official Web"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scott-Giles p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

The Prince of Wales as part of his full achievement of arms has many [[Heraldic badge]]s, which represents the history and sovereignty of his many titles.

====Prince of Wales' feathers====
{{Main|Prince of Wales's feathers}}
 
The Prince of Wales's feathers badge comprises "A plume of three [[ostrich]] feathers Argent enfiled by a royal coronet of alternate crosses and fleur-de-lys Or" with the motto 'Ich Dien' on a dark blue ribbon. The badge is probably the most recognisable element of the Prince of Wales's coat of arms. It has become synonymous as a personal insignia of the prince and also of the [[Principality of Wales]] itself.&lt;ref name="Official Web"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Feathers"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/titles-and-heraldry|title=Titles and Heraldry: Prince of Wales's Feathers |accessdate=2018-08-10 |work=Official website of the Prince of Wales}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a personal capacity the badge is granted as a [[Royal Warrant of Appointment (United Kingdom)|Royal Warrant of Appointment]] to companies that regularly supply of goods and services to the Prince. Currently there are 170 companies which are entitled to display this badge with the words 'By Appointment to HRH The Prince of Wales' underneath. The badge can be depicted on all premises, delivery vehicles, stationery and advertisements as well as on the individual products themselves.&lt;ref name="Warrants"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/titles-and-heraldry |title=Titles and Heraldry: Royal Warrants |accessdate=2018-08-10 |work=Official website of the Prince of Wales}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other organisations associated with Wales or the prince incorporate the badge into their own insignia including many Welsh regiments of the [[British Army]] (such as the [[Royal Regiment of Wales]]) and the [[Welsh Rugby Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Scott-Giles p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

Feathers used as either a crest or a badge have been an [[Royal badges of England|ancient heraldic badge]] of the [[House of Plantagenet]]. However it was not until its incorporation into the heraldic achievements of the Black Prince that the feathers have become an omnipresent feature of the coats of arms of the Prince of Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Scott-Giles pp. 89&amp;ndash;93&lt;/ref&gt;

====Red Dragon of Wales====
{{Main|Royal Badge of Wales}}
On 10 December 1901 a warrant signed by King [[Edward VII]] approved the addition of a badge of the [[Welsh Dragon|Red Dragon]] to the coat of arms of the Prince of Wales. The proclamation stated that: "on the sinister side a representation of the [[Royal badge of Wales|Badge of Wales]], namely, on a mount vert a Dragon, passant [[gules]], differenced (as in the Crest) with a label of three points argent." This was to complement the feathers badge, which was to be depicted on the dexter side of the prince's crest.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=27385 |date=10 December 1901 |page=8714 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Red Dragon, or ''Y Ddraig Goch'', has been a symbol associated with Wales since the time of [[Cadwaladr]], [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|King of Gwynedd]] in the 7th century. It was not until the beginning of the [[House of Tudor]] that the Red Dragon became a royal badge of the kings of England. Henry Tudor (later King [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]]) displayed the Dragon of Cadwaladr on his [[Royal standards of England|battle standard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.flaginstitute.org/pdfs/Robin%20Ashburner.pdf |title=Flags in Wales |last=Ashburner |first=Robin |date=2001 |website=flaginstitute.org |access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The red dragon became an official royal badge of the sovereign (representing Wales) according to a warrant issued in 1801. The warrant at the same time also confirmed the [[Tudor rose]] as a royal badge for England, the [[thistle]] for Scotland and the [[Celtic harp|golden harp]] for Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Pinces &amp; Pinces p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;

====Arms of the Duchy of Cornwall====
{{Main|Duke of Cornwall}}
The arms of the Duke of Cornwall are: "[[Sable (heraldry)|Sable]], fifteen [[bezant]]s, five, four, three, two and one." These arms were derived from those of [[Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall]], [[King of the Romans]], son and heir of King [[John, King of England|John]], who was also [[Count of Poitiers]] (or [[Poitou]]), represented by arms made up of [[pea]]s (poix) or [[gold coin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fox-Davis |first=Arthur Charles|authorlink=Arthur Charles Fox-Davies |title=The Book Of Public Arms.

Upon the accession of the prince's mother as Queen [[Elizabeth II]] on 6 February 1952, Prince Charles was automatically made the [[Duke of Cornwall]]. As such he is able to display the arms of the duchy on his coat of arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Burke's Peerage|first= |authorlink=Burke's Peerage |title=Burke's guide to the Royal Family (Burke's genealogical series)|url=https://archive.org/details/burkesguidetoroy00lond/page/136 |year=1973 |publisher=Burke's Peerage; 1st edition |location=London |isbn=0220662223|pages=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; This title has been granted to every heir apparent since 17 March 1337, in accordance with a charter issued by King [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] for Prince [[Edward the Black Prince]], his eldest son and heir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Burke's Peerage|first= |authorlink=Burke's Peerage |title=Burke's genealogical and heraldic history of peerage, baronetage and knightage |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_Pf8cAAAAYAAJ/page/n213 |year=1914 |publisher=Burke's Peerage |location=London |isbn=|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

||The [[House of Stuart|Stuart succession]] brought major changes to arms by incorporating elements of the arms of Scotland and Ireland in the 2nd and 3rd quarters respectively. The arms were first granted to Henry Stuart, the Duke of Rothesay after his father [[James I of England|James VI]] ascended the throne of England as James I. The arms were then granted twice more to the future Charles I and Charles II. It has been reported that James, the Duke of York (future James II) also bore the arms (despite not holding the title Prince of Wales), but only when his position as heir-presumptive to his brother became secure after the [[Exclusion Bill|Exclusion crisis]]. The arms were once more granted to James Francis Edward, who after 1688 became the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite Pretender]], whose son [[Charles Edward Stuart|Charles Edward]] (Bonnie Prince Charlie) continued the use of the arms in exile.&lt;ref&gt;Pinces &amp; Pinces pp. 170-189&lt;/ref&gt;

||[[File:Royal Hanover Inescutcheon.svg|100px|right|thumb|Arms of Hanover with the crown of Charlemagne]] The [[House of Hanover]] inherited the throne of Great Britain after the death of Queen [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]] in 1714, which led to the incorporation of the arms of King George I's possessions in [[Germany]] into the Royal arms. The blazon for the arms became: ''"1st quarter England impaling Scotland, 2nd France moderne, 3rd Ireland and 4th the [[Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Electorate of Hanover]], with a label of three points Argent. The Hanoverian quarter depicted: [[Duchy of Brunswick|Brunswick]], [[Lüneburg]], [[Duchy of Westphalia|Westphalia]] and an inescutcheon plain Gules, over all three."'' In the Royal arms the inescutcheon contained a depiction of the [[Crown of Charlemagne]], which was an [[augmentation of honour]] granted to the [[Prince-elector]]s of Hanover as [[Arch-Treasurer]] to the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. As heir to this Imperial office, only the Prince of Wales was entitled to bear the empty inescutcheon, in right of inheritance of this imperial office.&lt;ref&gt;Pinces &amp; Pinces pp. 206-229&lt;/ref&gt;

||With the [[Acts of Union 1800|Act of Union of 1800]], the arms of the Prince of Wales changed with those of the Kingdom. The ancient claim to France was abandoned, and England occupied the 1st and 4th quarter, while the Hanoverian quarter became an inescutcheon at the centre of the shield. This shield of arms was granted only once to George Augustus Frederick (the future George IV), who also became [[Prince regent]] in 1811.&lt;ref&gt;Pinces &amp; Pinces p. 229&lt;/ref&gt;

||The Royal arms were once again altered following the ascension of Queen [[Queen Victoria|Victoria]] to the throne in 1837, when the Hanoverian shield was dropped. The Hanoverian inescutcheon was replaced by the [[Coat of arms of Saxony|arms of Saxony]], which was a heraldic inheritance from the queen's husband Prince [[Albert, Prince Consort|Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] (a Duke of Saxony).&lt;ref name="Aveling 287"&gt;Aveling p. 287&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pinces &amp; Pinces p. 259&lt;/ref&gt; The inescutcheon only appeared in the arms of Albert's male-line descendants, and not in the Royal arms itself. According to the antiquarian Charles Boutell, the inescutcheon was placed as an "escutcheon of pretence", that "does not appear to be in accordance with either the spirit or the practical usage of true historical Heraldry".&lt;ref name="Boutell 256"/&gt; These arms were granted twice, first to 'Bertie' (later King Edward VII) and to the future George V. In his 1909 book ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry,'' [[Arthur Charles Fox-Davies]] writes: "It is much to be regretted that the arms of H.R.H. the Prince of Wales (the future George V) do not include the arms of his sovereignty of the Duchy of Cornwall, nor any allusion to his dignities of Prince of Wales or [[Earl of Chester]]."&lt;ref name="FD 486"&gt;Fox-Davies (1909) p. 486&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pinces &amp; Pinces p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;

Welsh local authorities had asked that the red dragon might be introduced into the Royal arms and the coinage, but neither of these wishes were granted. However a year later in 1911, King George V issued an [[order in council]] that replaced the inescutcheon of Saxony, in the Arms of the Prince of Wales, with an inescutcheon with the arms "representing the Principality of Wales". Blazoned as: ''"Quarterly Or and Gules four lions passant guardant counterchanged, ensigned by the Coronet of His degree."''&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=28473 |date=7 March 1911 |page=1939 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pinces &amp; Pinces p. 273&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958 Prince Charles, the Duke of Cornwall, son of Queen [[Elizabeth II]] was granted the same arms when he was made Prince of Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Pinces &amp; Pinces p. 280&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
===Consorts===
The family of the Prince of Wales is entitled to use certain heraldic features. The consort of the Prince of Wales (titled the [[Princess of Wales]]) is granted a unique coat of arms upon marriage, based on the [[Impalement (heraldry)|impaling]] of the prince's arms (on the dexter side) and her father's arms (on the sinister side). The consort is also entitled to use the prince's supporters (with the appropriate label) and the use of the prince's coronet over the arms.&lt;ref name="Boutell 363"/&gt; The current consort; [[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall|Camilla]], the [[Duchess of Cornwall]], was granted a coat of arms on 17 July 2005 upon her marriage to Charles, Prince of Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/biographies/hrh-duchess-cornwall |title=HRH The Duchess of Cornwall: Titles and Heraldry |accessdate=2018-10-09 |work=Official website of the Prince of Wales}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children===
The children of the heir apparent were given their own distinct coronet, unlike any other grandchildren of the sovereign. This was confirmed in the 1917 Royal Warrant, which proclaimed: ''"to all the sons and daughters of the son and heir apparent of us and of our successors a coronet composed of two [[Cross pattée|crosses pattée]] (or crosses formy) four fleurs-de-lis and two strawberry leaves."''&lt;ref name= "1917 warrant"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/news-grants/grants/item/71-coat-of-arms-prince-william |title=The Coat of Arms of HRH Prince William of Wales |accessdate=2018-10-09 |work=Official website of the College of Arms}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wives of the sons of the Prince of Wales use the same coronet as their husbands.

'''Edward Estlin''' "'''E.&amp;nbsp;E.'''" '''Cummings''' (October 14, 1894&amp;nbsp;– September 3, 1962), often styled as '''e&amp;nbsp;e&amp;nbsp;cummings''', as he is attributed in many of his published works,&lt;ref name="chicago84"/&gt; was an American poet, painter, essayist, author, and playwright. He wrote approximately 2,900 poems, two autobiographical novels, four plays, and several essays.

Cummings is associated with [[Modernist literature|modernist]] [[free verse|free-form poetry]]. Much of his work has original syntax and uses lower case spellings for poetic expression. His use of lower case extended to rendering even the personal pronoun ''I'' as ''i'', as in the phrase "i shall go". Cummings was politically neutral much of his life until the rise of the [[Cold War]] when he became a Republican and a supporter of [[Joseph McCarthy]]. He taught briefly at Harvard University in the 1950s, before his death in 1962.

==Life==

===Early years===
Edward Estlin Cummings was born on October 14, 1894, in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], to Edward Cummings and the former Rebecca Haswell Clarke, a well-known [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] couple in the city. His father was a professor at Harvard University and later became nationally known as the minister of South Congregational Church (Unitarian) in Boston, Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Leo W. ''This is Our Church''. Boston, Massachusetts: Society of the First Church in Boston, 2005: 104.&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, who loved to spend time with her children, played games with Cummings and his sister, Elizabeth. From an early age, Cummings' parents supported his creative gifts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/a_f/cummings/cummings_life.htm|title=E. E. Cummings' Life|website=english.illinois.edu|access-date=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cummings wrote poems and also drew as a child, and he often played outdoors with the many other children who lived in his neighborhood. He grew up in the company of such family friends as the philosophers [[William James]] and [[Josiah Royce]]. Many of Cummings' summers were spent on [[Silver Lake (Madison, New Hampshire)|Silver Lake]] in [[Madison, New Hampshire]], where his father had built two houses along the eastern shore. The family ultimately purchased the nearby [[Joy Farm]] where Cummings had his primary summer residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wpkDRPueLiMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=E.E. Cummings: A Biography|first=Christopher|last=Sawyer-Lauçanno|date=January 1, 2004|publisher=Sourcebooks, Inc.|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He expressed [[transcendentalism|transcendental]] leanings his entire life. As he matured, Cummings moved to an [[I and Thou|"I, Thou"]] relationship with God. His journals are replete with references to ''"le bon Dieu"'', as well as prayers for inspiration in his poetry and artwork (such as "Bon Dieu! may I some day do something truly great. amen."). Cummings "also prayed for strength to be his essential self ('may I be I is the only prayer—not may I be great or good or beautiful or wise or strong'), and for relief of spirit in times of depression ('almighty God! I thank thee for my soul; &amp; may I never die spiritually into a mere mind through disease of loneliness')."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.harvardsquarelibrary.org/unitarians/cummings.html |title=E.

Cummings wanted to be a poet from childhood and wrote poetry daily from age 8 to 22, exploring assorted forms. He graduated from [[Harvard University]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree ''[[magna cum laude]]'' and [[Phi Beta Kappa]] in 1915 and received a [[Master of Arts]] degree from the university in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/Co-Da/Cummings-E-E.html |title=E.

Upon graduating, he worked for a book dealer.&lt;ref Name="PoetryF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/e-e-cummings|title=E. E. Cummings|date=November 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===War years===
In 1917, with the First World War ongoing in Europe, Cummings enlisted in the [[AFS Intercultural Programs#WWI|Norton-Harjes Ambulance Corps]]. On the boat to France, he met William Slater Brown. They became fast friends. Due to an administrative mix-up, Cummings and Brown were not assigned to an ambulance unit for five weeks, during which time the two of them explored Paris. He fell in love with the city, to which he would return throughout his life.&lt;ref name=utexas&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.hrc.utexas.edu:8080/hrcxtf/view?docId=ead/00030.xml|title=E. E. Cummings: An Inventory of His Collection at the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center|publisher=Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center |accessdate=May 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During their service in the ambulance corps, the two young writers sent letters home that drew the attention of the military censors. They were known to prefer the company of French soldiers over fellow ambulance drivers. The two openly expressed anti-war views; Cummings spoke of his lack of hatred for the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Norman "Cummings, E[dward] E[stlin]", in Steven Serafin, ''The Continuum Encyclopedia of American Literature'', 2003, Continuum, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; On September 21, 1917, five months after starting his belated assignment, Cummings and William Slater Brown were arrested by the French military on suspicion of espionage and undesirable activities. They were held for three and a half months in a military detention camp at the ''[[La Ferté-Macé|Dépôt de Triage]]'', in [[La Ferté-Macé]], Orne, Normandy.&lt;ref name=utexas/&gt;

They were imprisoned with other detainees in a large room. Cummings' father failed to obtain his son's release through diplomatic channels, and in December 1917 he wrote a letter to President [[Woodrow Wilson]]. Cummings was released on December 19, 1917, and Brown was released two months later. Cummings used his prison experience as the basis for his novel, ''[[The Enormous Room]]'' (1922), about which [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] said, "Of all the work by young men who have sprung up since 1920 one book survives—''The Enormous Room'' by e e cummings... Those few who cause books to live have not been able to endure the thought of its mortality."&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, p. 1814.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Did F Scott Fitzgerald use upper- or lower-case for Cummings' name?  In a direct quote, it matters. --&gt;

Cummings returned to the United States on New Year's Day 1918. Later in 1918 he was drafted into the army. He served in the [[12th Division (United States)|12th Division]] at [[Camp Devens|Camp Devens, Massachusetts]], until November 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freepages.military.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~worldwarone/WWI/divisions.html#Twelfth|title=Data on U.S. Army Divisions during World War I, WWI, The Great War}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-war years===
Cummings returned to Paris in 1921 and had lived there for two years before returning to New York. His collection ''Tulips and Chimneys'' was published in 1923 and his inventive use of grammar and syntax is evident. The book was heavily cut by his editor. ''XLI Poems'' was published in 1925. With these collections, Cummings made his reputation as an avant garde poet.&lt;ref Name="PoetryF"/&gt;

During the rest of the 1920s and 1930s, Cummings returned to Paris a number of times, and traveled throughout Europe, meeting, among others, artist [[Pablo Picasso]]. In 1931 Cummings traveled to the [[Soviet Union]], recounting his experiences in ''[[Eimi (book)|Eimi]]'', published two years later. During these years Cummings also traveled to Northern Africa and [[Mexico]]. He worked as an essayist and portrait artist for ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine (1924–1927).

In 1926, Cummings' parents were in a car crash; only his mother survived, although she was severely injured. Cummings later described the crash in the following passage from his ''i: six nonlectures'' series given at Harvard (as part of the [[Charles Eliot Norton Lectures]]) in 1952 and 1953:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A locomotive cut the car in half, killing my father instantly. When two brakemen jumped from the halted train, they saw a woman standing – dazed but erect – beside a mangled machine; with blood spouting (as the older said to me) out of her head. One of her hands (the younger added) kept feeling her dress, as if trying to discover why it was wet. These men took my sixty-six-year old mother by the arms and tried to lead her toward a nearby farmhouse; but she threw them off, strode straight to my father's body, and directed a group of scared spectators to cover him. When this had been done (and only then) she let them lead her away.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His father's death had a profound effect on Cummings, who entered a new period in his artistic life. He began to focus on more important aspects of life in his poetry. He started this new period by paying homage to his father in the poem "my father moved through dooms of love".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~richie/poetry/html/aupoem114.html |title=My father moved through dooms of love |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050315070117/http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~richie/poetry/html/aupoem114.html |archivedate=March 15, 2005 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Gary | last = Lane | authorlink =  | year = 1976 | title = I Am: A Study of E.

Cummings spent the last decade of his life traveling, fulfilling speaking engagements, and spending time at his summer home, [[Joy Farm]], in [[Silver Lake, New Hampshire]].

==Personal life==

===Marriages===
[[File:EECummings pd4.jpg|thumb|upright|Sketched self-portrait circa 1920]]
Cummings was married briefly twice, first to Elaine Orr, then to Anne Minnerly Barton. His longest relationship lasted more than three decades, a common-law marriage to Marion Morehouse.

Cummings' first marriage, to Elaine Orr, began as a love affair in 1918 while she was still married to [[Scofield Thayer]], one of Cummings' friends from Harvard. During this time he wrote a good deal of his erotic poetry.&lt;ref name="Kennedy"&gt;''Selected Poems,'' Ed. Richard S. Kennedy, Liveright, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; After divorcing Thayer, Elaine married Cummings on March 19, 1924. The couple had a daughter together out of wedlock. However, the couple separated after two months of marriage and divorced less than nine months later.

Cummings married his second wife Anne Minnerly Barton on May 1, 1929, and they separated three years later in 1932. That same year, Anne obtained a [[Mexican divorce]]; it was not officially recognized in the United States until August 1934. Anne died in 1970 aged 72.

In 1934, after his separation from his second wife, Cummings met Marion Morehouse, a fashion model and photographer. Although it is not clear whether the two were ever formally married, Morehouse lived with Cummings in a [[common-law marriage]] until his death in 1962. She died on May 18, 1969,&lt;ref&gt;''Marion Morehouse Cummings, Poet's Widow, Top Model, Dies'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 19, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; while living at 4 [[Patchin Place]], [[Greenwich Village]], New York City, where Cummings had resided since September 1924.&lt;ref&gt;Sawyer-Lauçanno, p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political views===
According to his testimony in ''[[Eimi (book)|EIMI]]'', Cummings had little interest in politics until his trip to the Soviet Union in 1931,&lt;ref name=Blumenkranz&gt;Carla Blumenkranz, [http://www.poetryfoundation.org/article/180437 "The Enormous Poem: When E.E. Cummings Repunctuated Stalinism."] Poetry Foundation. www.poetryfoundation.org/&lt;/ref&gt; after which he shifted rightward on many political and social issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://college.cengage.com/english/lauter/heath/4e/students/author_pages/modern/cummings_ee.html|title=Heath Anthology of American Literature E.E. cummings – Author Page}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his radical and [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] public image, he was a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], and later, an ardent supporter of [[Joseph McCarthy]].&lt;ref&gt;Wetzsteon, Ross. 'Republic of Dreams: Greenwich Village: The American Bohemia, 1910–1960', pp. 449 [https://books.google.com/books?id=o2DB77ccf9sC&amp;pg=PA449 Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

===Poetry===
Despite Cummings' familiarity with [[avant-garde]] styles (likely affected by the ''[[Calligrammes]]'' of French poet [[Apollinaire]], according to a contemporary observation&lt;ref&gt;Taupin, Rene, ''The Influence of French Symbolism on Modern American Poetry 1927'' (Trans. William Pratt), AMS Inc, New York 1985  {{ISBN|0404615791}}&lt;/ref&gt;), much of his work is quite traditional. Many of his poems are [[sonnet]]s, albeit often with a modern twist. He occasionally used the [[blues#Lyrics|blues]] form and [[acrostics]]. Cummings' poetry often deals with themes of love and nature, as well as the relationship of the individual to the masses and to the world. His poems are also often rife with satire.

While his poetic forms and themes share an affinity with the [[Romanticism|Romantic tradition]], Cummings' work universally shows a particular idiosyncrasy of [[syntax]], or way of arranging individual words into larger phrases and sentences. Many of his most striking poems do not involve any typographical or punctuation innovations at all, but purely syntactic ones.

&lt;!---NB **The typography is Cummings' original setting**---&gt;

As well as being influenced by notable [[Modernist literature|modernists]], including [[Gertrude Stein]] and [[Ezra Pound]], Cummings in his early work drew upon the [[Imagism|imagist]] experiments of [[Amy Lowell]]. Later, his visits to Paris exposed him to [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]], which he reflected in his work. He began to rely on symbolism and allegory, where he once had used simile and metaphor. In his later work, he rarely used comparisons that required objects that were not previously mentioned in the poem, choosing to use a symbol instead. Due to this, his later poetry is "frequently more lucid, more moving, and more profound than his earlier."&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Norman. ''E. E. Cummings the Art of His Poetry.'' Baltimore: Johns Hopkins, 1967. p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Cummings also liked to incorporate imagery of nature and death into much of his poetry.

While some of his poetry is [[free verse]] (with no concern for [[rhyme]] or [[meter (poetry)|meter]]), many have a recognizable sonnet structure of 14 lines, with an intricate rhyme scheme. A number of his poems feature a typographically exuberant style, with words, parts of words, or punctuation symbols scattered across the page, often making little sense until read aloud, at which point the meaning and emotion become clear. Cummings, who was also a painter, understood the importance of presentation, and used typography to "paint a picture" with some of his poems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Iain | last = Landles | authorlink = Iain Landles | year = 2001 | title = An Analysis of Two Poems by E. E. Cummings | journal=SPRING, the Journal of the E. E. Cummings Society | volume = 10 | pages = 31–43 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The seeds of Cummings' unconventional style appear well established even in his earliest work. At age six, he wrote to his father:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;FATHER DEAR. BE, YOUR FATHER-GOOD AND GOOD,&lt;br&gt;
HE IS GOOD NOW, IT IS NOT GOOD TO SEE IT RAIN,&lt;br&gt;
FATHER DEAR IS, IT, DEAR, NO FATHER DEAR,&lt;br&gt;
LOVE, YOU DEAR,&lt;br&gt;
ESTLIN.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Selected letters of E. E. Cummings'', (1972) Edward Estlin Cummings, Frederick Wilcox Dupee, George Stade. University of Michigan p. 3 {{ISBN|978-0-233-95637-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following his autobiographical novel, ''[[The Enormous Room]]'', Cummings' first published work was a collection of poems titled ''[[Tulips and Chimneys]]'' (1923). This work was the public's first encounter with his characteristic eccentric use of grammar and punctuation.

Some of Cummings' most famous poems do not involve much, if any, odd typography or punctuation, but still carry his unmistakable style, particularly in unusual and impressionistic word order.

{{Quote box |width=300px |align=right ||salign=right

Cummings' work often does not proceed in accordance with the conventional combinatorial rules that generate typical English sentences (for example, "they sowed their isn't"). In addition, a number of Cummings' poems feature, in part or in whole, intentional misspellings, and several incorporate phonetic spellings intended to represent particular dialects. Cummings also made use of inventive formations of compound words, as in "in Just"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/images/modeng/public/Cum2Dia/CumDi580.jpg |title=in Just}}&lt;/ref&gt; which features words such as "mud-luscious", "puddle-wonderful", and "eddieandbill." This poem is part of a sequence of poems titled ''Chansons Innocentes'';&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15398 |title=''Chansons Innocentes'' |access-date=October 10, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051227115128/http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15398 |archive-date=December 27, 2005 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; it has many references comparing the "balloonman" to [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], the mythical creature that is half-goat and half-man. Literary critic [[R.P. Blackmur]] has commented that this use of language is "frequently unintelligible because [Cummings] disregards the historical accumulation of meaning in words in favour of merely private and personal associations."&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Norman. ''E. E. Cummings the Art of His Poetry''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1967. pp. 61–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of Cummings' poems are satirical and address social issues&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15404 |title="why must itself up every of a park" |access-date=October 10, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100813233241/http://poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15404 |archive-date=August 13, 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; but have an equal or even stronger bias toward romanticism: time and again his poems celebrate love, sex, and the season of rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15403 |title="anyone lived in a pretty how town" |access-date=October 10, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726121247/http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15403 |archive-date=July 26, 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cummings also wrote children's books and novels. A notable example of his versatility is an introduction he wrote for a collection of the comic strip ''[[Krazy Kat]]''.

===Controversy===
Cummings is known for controversial subject matter, as he wrote numerous erotic poems. He also sometimes included ethnic slurs in his writing. For instance, in his 1950 collection ''Xaipe: Seventy-One Poems'', Cummings published two poems containing words that caused outrage in some quarters.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Norman, and Harry Thornton Moore. ''E. E. Cummings the Growth of a Writer''. Carbondale: Southern Illinois UP, 1964. pp. 153–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;poem&gt;
:one day a nigger
:caught in his hand
:a little star no bigger
:than not to understand

:i'll never let you go
:until you've made me white"
:so she did and now
:stars shine at night.&lt;ref name="Cummings, 1950"&gt;Cummings, ''Xaipe, Seventy-one Poems''. New York: Oxford UP, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;

and

&lt;poem&gt;
:a kike is the most dangerous
:machine as yet invented

:ity(out of a jew a few
:dead dollars and some twisted laws)
:it comes both prigged and canted&lt;ref name="Cummings, 1950"/&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;

Cummings biographer Catherine Reef notes of the controversy:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Friends begged Cummings to reconsider publishing these poems, and the book's editor pleaded with him to withdraw them, but he insisted that they stay. All the fuss perplexed him. The poems were commenting on prejudice, he pointed out, and not condoning it. He intended to show how derogatory words cause people to see others in terms of stereotypes rather than as individuals. "America (which turns Hungarian into 'hunky' &amp; Irishman into 'mick' and Norwegian into 'square- head') is to blame for 'kike,'" he said.&lt;ref Name="Reef"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[William Carlos Williams]] spoke out in his defense.&lt;ref Name="Reef"&gt;''E. Cummings'' (2006) by Catherine Reef, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt p. 115 {{ISBN|978-0-618-56849-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarification needed|reason=|date=April 2018}}

===Plays===
During his lifetime, Cummings published four plays. ''HIM'', a three-act play, was first produced in 1928 by the [[Provincetown Players]] in New York City. The production was directed by James Light. The play's main characters are "Him", a playwright, portrayed by [[William Johnstone (actor)|William Johnstone]], and "Me", his girlfriend, portrayed by [[Erin O'Brien-Moore]].

Cummings said of the unorthodox play:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Relax and give the play a chance to strut its stuff—relax, stop wondering what it is all 'about'—like many strange and familiar things, Life included, this play isn't 'about,' it simply is. . . . Don't try to enjoy it, let it try to enjoy you. &lt;small&gt;DON'T TRY TO UNDERSTAND IT, LET IT TRY TO UNDERSTAND YOU.&lt;/small&gt;"&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Anthropos, or the Future of Art'' is a short, one-act play that Cummings contributed to the anthology ''Whither, Whither or After Sex, What? A Symposium to End Symposium''. The play consists of dialogue between Man, the main character, and three "infrahumans", or inferior beings. The word ''[[Greek language|anthropos]]'' is the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for "man", in the sense of "mankind".

''Tom, A Ballet'' is a ballet based on ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]''. The ballet is detailed in a "synopsis" as well as descriptions of four "episodes", which were published by Cummings in 1935. It has never been performed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gvsu.edu/english/cummings/Tom.html GVSU.edu The E. E. Cummings Society] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050423191607/http://www.gvsu.edu/english/cummings/Tom.html |date=April 23, 2005 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Santa Claus: A Morality]]'' was probably Cummings' most successful play. It is an allegorical Christmas fantasy presented in one act of five scenes. The play was inspired by his daughter Nancy, with whom he was reunited in 1946. It was first published in the Harvard College magazine, ''Wake''. The play's main characters are Santa Claus, his family (Woman and Child), Death, and Mob. At the outset of the play, Santa Claus' family has disintegrated due to their lust for knowledge (Science). After a series of events, however, Santa Claus' faith in love and his rejection of the materialism and disappointment he associates with Science are reaffirmed, and he is reunited with Woman and Child.

===Name and capitalization===
Cummings' publishers and others have often echoed the unconventional [[orthography]] in his poetry by writing his name in lowercase and without periods ([[full stop]]s), but normal orthography for his name (uppercase and periods) is supported by scholarship and preferred by publishers today.&lt;ref name="friedman92" /&gt; Cummings himself used both the lowercase and capitalized versions, though he most often signed his name with capitals.&lt;ref name="friedman92"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Friedman | first =  Norman | year = 1992 | title = Not "e. e. cummings" | journal=Spring | volume = 1 | pages = 114–21 | url = http://faculty.gvsu.edu/websterm/cummings/caps.htm | accessdate = December 13, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of lowercase for his initials was popularized in part by the title of some books, particularly in the 1960s, printing his name in lower case on the cover and spine. In the preface to ''E. E. Cummings: The Growth of a Writer'' by Norman Friedman, critic Harry T. Moore notes Cummings "had his name put legally into lower case, and in his later books the titles and his name were always in lower case."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Friedman | first = Norman | title = E. E. Cummings: The Growth of a Writer | location = Carbondale | publisher=Southern Illinois University Press | year = 1964 | isbn = 0-8093-0978-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cummings' widow, however, this is incorrect.&lt;ref name="friedman92" /&gt; She wrote to Friedman: "You should not have allowed H. Moore to make such a stupid &amp; childish statement about Cummings &amp; his signature." On February 27, 1951, Cummings wrote to his French translator D. Jon Grossman that he preferred the use of upper case for the particular edition they were working on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Friedman | first = Norman | year = 1995 | title = Not "e. e. cummings" Revisited | journal=Spring | volume = 5 | pages = 41–43 | url = http://faculty.gvsu.edu/websterm/cummings/caps2.html | accessdate = May 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One Cummings scholar believes that on the rare occasions that Cummings signed his name in all lowercase, he may have intended it as a gesture of humility, not as an indication that it was the preferred orthography for others to use.&lt;ref name="friedman92" /&gt; Additionally, the ''Chicago Manual of Style'', which prescribes favoring non-standard capitalizion of names in accordance with the bearer's strongly stated preference, notes "E. E. Cummings can be safely capitalized; it was one of his publishers, not he himself, who lowercased his name."&lt;ref name="chicago84"&gt;{{cite book |publisher=Chicago University Press|year=2010|title=Chicago Manual of Style|edition=16|section=Captalization of Personal Names|page=388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==
In 1943, modern dancer and choreographer [[Jean Erdman]] presented "The Transformations of Medusa, Forever and Sunsmell" with a commissioned score by [[John Cage]] and a spoken text from the title poem by E. E. Cummings, sponsored by the [[Arts Club of Chicago]]. Erdman also choreographed "Twenty Poems" (1960), a cycle of E. E. Cummings' poems for eight dancers and one actor, with a commissioned score by [[Teiji Ito]]. It was performed in the round at the [[Circle in the Square Theatre]] in Greenwich Village.

Numerous composers have set Cummings' poems to music:
* In 1961, [[Pierre Boulez]] composed "Cummings ist der dichter" from poems by E.E. Cummings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brahms.ircam.fr/works/work/6957/|title=cummings ist der dichter, Pierre Boulez}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Aribert Reimann]] set Cummings to music in "Impression IV" (1961) for soprano and piano.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/2743128|title=Impression IV : nach einem Gedicht von E.E.

* [[Morton Feldman]] (1926-1987) in 1951 composed "4 Songs to e.e. cummings" for soprano, piano and cello, using material from Cummings' "50 poems" of 1940: "!Blac", "Air", "(Sitting In A Tree-)" and "(Moan)".
* The Icelandic singer [[Björk]] used lines from Cummings's poem "I Will Wade Out" for the lyrics of "Sun in My Mouth" on her 2001 album ''[[Vespertine]].'' On her next album, ''[[Medúlla]]'' (2004), Björk used his poem "It May Not Always Be So" as the lyrics for the song "Sonnets/Unrealities XI."
* The American composer [[Eric Whitacre]] wrote a [[Eric Whitacre#SATB choral|cycle of works]] for choir titled ''The City and the Sea'', which consists of five poems by Cummings set to music.
* Others who have composed settings for his poems include [[Dominic Argento]], [[William Bergsma]], [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Marc Blitzstein]], [[John Cage]], [[Romeo Cascarino]], [[Aaron Copland]], [[Serge de Gastyne]], [[David Diamond (composer)|David Diamond]], [[John Woods Duke|John Duke]], [[Margaret Garwood]], [[Daron Hagen]], [[Michael Hedges]], [[Richard Hundley]], [[Barbara Kolb]], [[Leonard Lehrman]], [[Robert Manno]], [[Salvatore Martirano]], [[William Mayer (composer)|William Mayer]], [[John Musto]], [[Paul Nordoff]], [[Tobias Picker]], [[Vincent Persichetti]], [[Ned Rorem]], [[Peter Schickele]], [[Elie Siegmeister]], [[Aki Takase]], [[Hugo Weisgall]], [[Dan Welcher]], and [[James Yannatos]], among many others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lieder.net/lieder/c/cummings/ "E.E.

'''Ethel Wood''' (16 January 1901 – 19 August 2011) was a [[Guernsey]] [[supercentenarian]]. At the age of 110, Wood was the ninth-oldest verified person who died in the United Kingdom following the death of 112-year-old [[Margaret Fish]] on 12 March 2011. Wood was not born in the United Kingdom, since Guernsey is a [[Crown dependencies|crown-dependency]], and legally never part of the Kingdom of England or the the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmjust/56/5604.htm |title=Crown Dependencies – Justice Committee |website=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] |date=30 March 2010 |accessdate=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
.

==Biography==

Ethel Wood was born in [[Saint Sampson, Guernsey]]. She was one of five children born to William and Lily Wood. Wood trained as a teacher in London prior to the [[German occupation of the Channel Islands|German occupation of Guernsey]]. Like her siblings, she never married or had children.

She moved to Essex in the 1990s to care for her younger sister, Edith. Wood lived in her own home until breaking her leg during a fall a month before her 110th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazette-news.co.uk/news/local/clacton/8797400.Ethel__aged_110__says___I_don_t_feel_any_different_/ "Ethel, aged 110, says: "I don't feel any different""], ''Daily Gazette'' ([[Clacton-on-Sea|Clacton]], Frinton and Walton), 18 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eadt.co.uk/news/essex-amazing-ethel-celebrates-her-110th-birthday-1-776944|title=Essex: ‘Amazing’ Ethel celebrates her 110th birthday|first=By Chris|last=Harris|publisher=|accessdate=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethel died suddenly on 19 August 2011, aged 110 years, 215 days in England. If she had lived until December of that year, she would have surpassed the only other supercententenarian from Guernsey, [[Margaret Ann Neve]] (1792–1903).

The '''Facebook real-name policy controversy''' refers to the controversy over [[Social networking service|social networking]] site [[Facebook]]{{'}}s "[[real-name system]]" dictating how people register their accounts and configure their [[user profile]]s.  The controversy stems from a policy that those who have been adversely affected describe as penalizing users who are in fact using their real names which Facebook has nevertheless deemed to be "fake", while simultaneously allowing anyone to create fake yet plausible-sounding names, as well as obviously implausible-sounding names comprising word combinations that Facebook's software fails to recognize as unlikely to be real because their alleged nonstandard spelling or confusion with fictional characters. Facebook furthermore prohibits users from accurately representing names which according to the site have "too many words", and prohibits initializing first names, preventing users who do so in real life from formatting their own names as they see fit.

== Background ==
The social networking website [[Facebook]] has maintained the [[real-name system]] policy for user profiles.  According to Facebook, the real-name policy stems from the position "that way, you always know who you're connecting with. This helps keep our community safe."&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/16/living/facebook-name-policy/ |title=Facebook 'real name' policy stirs questions around identity |last=Grinberg |first=Emanuella |date=September 18, 2014 |publisher=[[CNN]] |accessdate=October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Facebook"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/help/112146705538576|title=What names are allowed on Facebook?|last=|first=|date=|publisher=[[Facebook]] |accessdate=October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise per this policy, a "real name" is defined by "your real name as it would be listed on your credit card, driver's license or student ID."&lt;ref name="Business Insider"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-apologizes-for-real-name-policy-2014-10|title=Facebook Apologizes For 'Real Name' Policy That Forced Drag Queens To Change Their Profiles|last=Levy|first=Karyne|date=October 1, 2014|work=[[Business Insider]] |accessdate=October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2012, Facebook estimated that more than 83&amp;nbsp;million Facebook accounts are fake accounts.&lt;ref name="usa"&gt;{{cite news |title=Facebook: About 83 million accounts are fake |work=[[USA Today]] |url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/story/2012-08-03/cnbc-facebook-fake-accounts/56759964/1 |accessdate=August 4, 2012 |date=August 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this revelation, the share price of Facebook dropped below $20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Facebook share price slumps below $20 amid fake account flap |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/aug/02/facebook-share-price-slumps-20-dollars |accessdate=August 4, 2012 |location=London |first=Dominic |last=Rushe |date=August 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook has asserted that "authentic identity is important to the Facebook experience, and our goal is that every account on Facebook should represent a real person."&lt;ref name="usa" /&gt;

==Affected users==

===Ethnic groups===

====Native Americans====
[[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] have been repeatedly targeted due to Facebook's policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holpuck|first1=Amanda|title=Facebook still suspending Native Americans over 'real name' policy|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/16/facebook-real-name-policy-suspends-native-americans|accessdate=6 March 2015|publisher=Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Robin Kills The Enemy, a resident of the [[Sioux]] Rosebud reservation in South Dakota, found that when she tried to register her surname in its normal format, the site would not let her use them, so she resorted to combining the three words, spelling them as one word.  After having been a member for some time, she eventually contacted the site in an attempt to have her surname spelled as it actually is in real life.  However, after reaching out to Facebook, they instead deactivated her account without explanation.  When she was finally able to make contact with an actual employee, they wrote back telling her "Fake names are a violation of our Terms of Use. Facebook requires users to provide their full first and last names".  She eventually managed to have her account reinstated; however, users with the surname Kills The Enemy are, as of 2015, still required by Facebook to spell their surname without spaces as a single word.&lt;ref name=ictmn&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ramos|first1=Nestor|title=Facebook no friend to American Indian names |url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2009/02/16/facebook-no-friend-american-indian-names-82895|website=Indian Country Today media network}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Shane Creepingbear, an Oklahoman member of the [[Kiowa]] tribe, reported that he had been "kicked off" of Facebook on [[Columbus Day]] for having a supposedly fake name.&lt;ref name=metroCreepingbear&gt;{{cite web|last1=McAteer|first1=Ollie|title=Native Americans booted off Facebook for having ‘fake’ names like Creepingbear|url=http://metro.co.uk/2015/02/11/native-americans-booted-off-facebook-for-having-fake-names-like-creepingbear-5057955/|website=Metro}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Lance Brown Eyes, an [[Oglala Lakota|Oglala]], found that his account had been suspended; when he was able to send in documentation to Facebook proving his identity, Facebook reinstated his account, but changed his name to "Lance Brown".&lt;ref name=IBT&gt;{{cite web|last1=Russon|first1=Mary-Ann|title=Facebook fail: Native Americans keep being accused of using fake names|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/facebook-fail-native-americans-keep-being-accused-using-fake-names-1487378|website=International Business Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Dana Lone Hill, a member of the [[Lakota people|Lakota]] tribe who had been a registered Facebook user for several years, discovered one day that she had been locked out of her account.  A message from Facebook said "it looks like the name on your Facebook account may not be your authentic name".  After a week, during which she had to send in her personal documentation to Facebook, her account access was restored.  She has since threatened a class-action lawsuit on behalf of Native Americans against Facebook due to how it exercises its name policies.

A number of Native Americans have objected to Facebook's inquiries into their names, and to Facebook's request that they provide proof of identification or other documentation in order to use the service.&lt;ref name="The Washington Post"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Phillip| first1=Abby| title=Online ‘authenticity’ and how Facebook's ‘real name’ policy hurts Native Americans | date=October 2, 2014|accessdate=October 5, 2015|url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/02/10/online-authenticity-and-how-facebooks-real-name-policy-hurts-native-americans/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Native American activists claimed to be planning to file a [[class action lawsuit]] against Facebook regarding the 'real name' policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holpuck|first1=Amanda|title=Native American activist to sue Facebook over site's 'real name' policy|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/19/native-american-activist-facebook-lawsuit-real-name|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|work=The Guardian|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Japanese====
In 2008, a woman in Japan named Hiroko Yoda had her Facebook account suspended over her [[Yoda_(disambiguation)|surname]], which is common in Japan, being confused with a [[Star Wars]] character of the [[Yoda|same name]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/2632170/Woman-called-Yoda-blocked-from-Facebook.html|title=Woman called Yoda blocked from Facebook|first=Matthew|last=Moore|date=27 August 2008|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Irish====
The [[Dublin]] branch of the [[Irish language]] rights group, Misneach, started a [[Change.org]] [[online petition]] to demand the right to use Irish names on Facebook and protested outside Facebook's European headquarters in Dublin on October 7, 2015.&lt;ref name="Irish Times"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/protest-at-dublin-facebook-hq-over-real-name-policy-1.2345414 |title=Protest at Dublin Facebook HQ over ‘real-name’ policy |last=Tracer |first=Dan |date=September 9, 2015 |work=[[Irish Times]] |accessdate=September 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scottish Gaelic====
In 2015, one Gaelic-speaking retired policeman won the right to use his Gaelic name on Facebook, even though it was not his legal name. Some Scottish Gaelic surnames, such as NicIllAnndrais, contain more than two capital letters and are still disallowed by Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Man wins Facebook battle over ‘fake’ Gaelic name|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/odd/man-wins-facebook-battle-over-fake-gaelic-name-1-3702815|date=26 February 2015|website=www.scotsman.com|accessdate=31 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chamoru====
In the Spanish-influenced indigenous [[Chamoru]] culture of the [[Marianas]], the standard naming convention has historically been for a person to use their mother's [[maiden name]] as their middle name. (Chamoru culture, having been colonized by Spain, went through a period where indigenous names and naming conventions were forcibly eradicated and replaced by what the conquering Spanish deemed acceptable.) Furthermore, using one's full name rather than simply the first and last is commonplace, if only for disambiguation purposes due to a relatively small pool of surnames. Therefore, middle names such as De Leon Guerrero and De La Cruz are frequently encountered. However, attempting to register such names as one's middle name results in a message telling users that "Names can't have too many words." Therefore, many Chamoru users are forced to either run all of the words together as if they were one single word, or to initialize each word to a common acronym such as DLG or DLC.

In cases where the acronym is employed, Facebook automatically changes to lower-case all letters except the first. (Use of periods, e.g. D.L.G., will result in a message telling users that "Profile names can't have too many periods.") Therefore, someone commonly known in real life by a name such as Mary De Leon Guerrero Mafnas would have to resort to using what on Facebook would end up being "Mary Dlg Mafnas". The message is not accompanied by an option to challenge/appeal the restriction or to send Facebook documentation that the format is how one normally formats their name in real life.

====Vietnamese====
In January 2015, a 23-year-old Australian bank employee claiming to be named Phuc Dat Bich posted a photo of his passport identification page to Facebook, protesting that the company had unfairly shut down his account for being "false and misleading".&lt;ref name=BBCBich&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-34897404|title=Phuc Dat Bich: Australian with 'misleading' name thanks supporters|date=November 23, 2015|accessdate=November 23, 2015|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Is it because I'm Asian? Is it?" he asked. The BBC reported that in Vietnamese the name is pronounced similarly to "Phoo Da Bi" (IPA: [[Help:IPA/Vietnamese|{{ipa|/fukp˦˥ ɗat˩ ɓic˦˥/}}]]).&lt;ref name=BBCBich/&gt; After his reinstatement, Bich posted a thank you note to supportive Facebook fans, stating he was "glad and honoured to be able to make people happy by simply making them laugh at something that appears outrageous and ridiculous".&lt;ref name=BBCBich/&gt; Subsequently "Phuc Dat" published a further message admitting it was a hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Phuc Dat Bich admits hoax in Facebook name battle|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-34918491|accessdate=25 November 2015|publisher=BBC|date=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tamils====
Tamils do not have surnames: They have their father or mother or both father and mother's first name as initials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://bumpahead.net/tamil-name-structure-10dd63730563|title=Tamil name structure… |author=moulee|date=19 July 2009|publisher=bumpahead.net|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This standard naming practice has not been acknowledged by Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/facebook-should-scrap-its-regressive-real-names-policy/article7797302.ece|title=Really harassed by Facebook’s ‘real names’|author=G. Sampath|date=24 October 2015|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=15 April 2018|via=www.thehindu.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transgender users===
Facebook's real-name policy does not reflect adopted names or [[pseudonym]]s used by the [[transgender]] community, and has led to suspending users with real names that might be thought to be fake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press| url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2009-05-25/business/20872135_1_accounts-with-fake-names-facebook-facebook-guidelines-and-features|work=The San Francisco Chronicle|first=Barbara|last=Ortutay|date=May 25, 2009|title=Real users caught in Facebook fake-name purge|accessdate=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A user via the anonymous [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] app [[Secret (app)|Secret]] began reporting "fake names" which caused user profiles to be suspended, specifically targeting the [[stage name]]s of [[drag queen]]s.&lt;ref name="Business Insider"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holpuck|first1=Amanda|title=Facebook still freezing accounts despite apology to drag queens over 'real names.'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/17/facebook-still-freezing-accounts-despite-apology-drag-queens-real-names|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transgender people have also been affected by the policy, including one former Facebook employee who initiated development on Facebook's custom gender options, who was suspended on the day the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled in ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]'' that same-sex marriage bans were unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://medium.com/@zip/my-name-is-only-real-enough-to-work-at-facebook-not-to-use-on-the-site-c37daf3f4b03|title=My name is only real enough to work at Facebook, not use on the site|publisher=[[Medium.com]]|author=Zip|date=June 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2015/06/28/woman-responsible-for-facebook-gender-options-kicked-off-for-violating-real-names-policy/|title=Woman responsible for Facebook gender options kicked off for violating real names policy|date=June 28, 2015|first=Naith|last=Payton|publisher=[[Pink News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to gender non-conforming activist D.

On October 1, 2014, [[Chris Cox (Facebook)|Chris Cox]], Chief Product Officer at Facebook, offered an apology to the LGBT community and drag kings and queens: &lt;blockquote&gt;In the two weeks since the real-name policy issues surfaced, we've had the chance to hear from many of you in these communities and understand the policy more clearly as you experience it. We've also come to understand how painful this has been. We owe you a better service and a better experience using Facebook, and we're going to fix the way this policy gets handled so everyone affected here can go back to using Facebook as you were.&lt;ref name="chriscoxpost"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/chris.cox/posts/10101301777354543|title=Chris Cox - I want to apologize to the affected community of drag...|last=Cox|first=Chris|date=October 1, 2014|publisher=[[Facebook]] |accessdate=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Users target of religious persecution ===
Secular, atheist, agnostic, humanist, or users who comment or blog expressing views critical of particular religions, sects or religion in general, as well as religious people who express the opposing views critical of atheism or agnosticism very often have a legitimate need to use an alias. Some of these users could suffer rejection, retaliation or violence if their views – contrary to those of their family, friends or community – are known. In some cases, secular bloggers are exposed to imprisonment by an intolerant government, violent attacks in the street or even being killed by religious fanatics. Examples are the incarceration of activist and blogger [[Raif Badawi]] in Saudi Arabia and a string of attacks and murders of secular activists in [[Attacks by Islamic extremists in Bangladesh|Bangladesh]] or Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/abdullah-sharif/pakistans-religious-extremism_b_9577338.html|title=Pakistan's Religious Extremism: A World Menace|first=Abdullah|last=Sharif|date=1 April 2016|website=huffingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reaction ==
International non-profit [[digital rights]] group [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] stated they were "alarmed to hear that Facebook's 'real name' policy is disproportionately affecting the LGBTQ community."&lt;ref name="EFF"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/09/facebooks-real-name-policy-can-cause-real-world-harm-lgbtq-community |title=Facebook's 'Real Name' Policy Can Cause Real-World Harm for the LGBTQ Community |last1=Kayyali |last2=York |first1=Nadia |first2=Jillian |date=September 16, 2014 |publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] |accessdate=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Online magazine]] ''[[Queerty]]'' called Facebook's policy "a frankly creepy overreach of authority", adding "There are a million reasons why someone would choose to self-identify with a name other than the one that's printed on their birth certificate.

In an interview for MAGE Magazine, Second Life entrepreneur Jennifer Ceara Firehawk stated: "If we are not using our page to abuse or grief others they just need to leave us be.

Once you force a person to change the SL name they will lose money due to not being able to find them on FB or SL as they may use FB for their buisness [sic] or advertise.

== Compromise to protect those with special circumstances  ==
On December 15, 2015, Facebook announced in a press release&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2015/12/community-support-fyi-improving-the-names-process-on-facebook/|title=Community Support FYI: Improving the Names Process on Facebook |last1=Osofsky |first1=Jason |last2=Gage |first2=Todd |date=December 15, 2015 |website=Facebook Newsroom |publisher=Facebook |access-date=December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that it would be providing a compromise to its real name policy after protests from groups such as the gay/lesbian community and abuse victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/facebook-modifies-real-names-policy-testing-use-of-assumed-names-1.2702400 |title=Facebook modifies 'real names' policy, testing use of assumed names |last=AFP |date=December 16, 2015 |website=CTV News |publisher=Bell Media |access-date=December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site is developing a protocol that will allow members to provide specifics as to their "special circumstance" or "unique situation" with a request to use pseudonyms, subject to verification of their true identities. At that time, this was already being tested in the U.S. Product manager Todd Gage and vice president of global operations Justin Osofsky also promised a new method for reducing the number of members who must go through ID verification while ensuring the safety of others on Facebook. The fake name reporting procedure will also be modified, forcing anyone who makes such an allegation to provide specifics that would be investigated and giving the accused individual time to dispute the allegation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/15/facebook-change-controversial-real-name-policy?subid=17310058&amp;CMP=EMCNEWEML6619I2 |title=Facebook changes controversial 'real name' policy in wake of criticism  |last1=Holpuch |first1=Amanda |date=December 15, 2015 |website=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited |access-date=December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This measure was criticised by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who pointed out that it forces the most vulnerable users to reveal intimate details of their personal lives. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/12/changes-facebooks-real-names-policy-still-dont-fix-problem|title=Changes to Facebook’s "Real Names" Policy Still Don’t Fix the Problem}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, as of January 2018, there is no evidence in Facebook's policies that this measure was ever implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/help/229715077154790?helpref=related|title=What other names are allowed on Facebook?|publisher=Facebook|access-date=May 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Five Tiger Generals''' is a popular appellation in Chinese culture for any five military generals serving under a ruler. This term is used in literature texts, plays and popular culture. In historical contexts, "Five Tiger Generals" usually refers to the five best military generals serving under the ruler. The term does not appear in Chinese historical records and is not used officially.

==In literature==
When applied to the [[Three Kingdoms]] period, the "Five Tiger Generals" refer to five generals from the state of [[Shu Han]]. In the historical text ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'' (''Sanguozhi''), the biographies of [[Guan Yu]], [[Zhang Fei]], [[Zhao Yun]], [[Ma Chao]] and [[Huang Zhong]] are placed in the same volume. In the historical novel ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'' (''Sanguo Yanyi''), which romanticises the events before and during the Three Kingdoms period, the [[Shu Han|Shu]] emperor [[Liu Bei]] actually bestowed the titles of "Five Tiger Generals" on these five generals.&lt;ref&gt;''Sanguo Yanyi'' ch. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; The historicity of the Tiger Generals is unknown; those generals existed but it is uncertain whether they were granted the titles contemporarily or posthumously honoured as such.

In the classical novel ''[[Water Margin]]'', five of the 108 outlaws at [[Mount Liang|Liangshan Marsh]] – [[Guan Sheng]], [[Lin Chong]], [[Qin Ming]], [[Huyan Zhuo]] and [[Dong Ping]] – are named the "Five Tiger Generals" of the Liangshan cavalry.

In the historical novel ''[[Shuo Tang]]'', the rebellion force of [[Wagang Army]] has ''Five Tiger Generals'' including [[Qin Shubao]], [[Shan Xiongxin]], [[Cheng Yaojin]], [[Wang Bodang]] and [[Luo Cheng]].

The [[Qing dynasty]] writer Li Yutang named [[Di Qing]], Shi Yu, Zhang Zhong, Li Yi, and Liu Qing as the "Five Tiger Generals" in his works ''Romance of Di Qing'', ''The Five Tigers Conquer the West'', and ''The Five Tigers Pacify the South''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://open-lit.com/listbook.php?cid=2&amp;gbid=106&amp;start=0 Chapter Two of Wuhu Zhengxi]&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Heroes of the Ming Dynasty'', a novel romanticising the events leading to the founding of the Ming dynasty, [[Xu Da]], [[Tang He]], [[Chang Yuchun]], [[Hu Dahai]], and [[Mu Ying]] are named the "Five Founding Tiger Generals of Ming".

==Cultural impact==
In present-day terminology, "Five Tiger Generals" can refer to any group of five that is particularly outstanding in a certain field.

Hsiao Shou-li, Chiang Wu-tung, Chiao Tsai-pao, Chen Chun-sheng, and Su Teng-wang are called "Five Tiger Generals" of [[Taiwanese opera]].

Taiwanese politicians Kuo Yu-hsin, Li Wan-chu, Kuo Kuo-chi, Li Yuan-chan, and [[Wu San-lien]] are called the "Five Tiger Generals" of the [[Taiwan Provincial Consultative Council]]. Together with female politician [[Hsu Shih-hsien]], the six of them are called "Five Tigers and the Phoenix".

In the 1980s and 1990s, the five hosts of the Taiwanese television channel [[Sanlih E-Television]], He Yih-hang, Peng Chia-chia, Yang Fan, Yu Tien and Li Teng-tsai are called "Five Tiger Generals".

In the 1980s, [[Hong Kong]] television actors [[Felix Wong]], [[Michael Miu]], [[Kent Tong]], [[Andy Lau]] and [[Tony Leung Chiu-wai|Tony Leung]] are called the "[[Five Tiger Generals (TVB)|Five Tiger Generals]] of [[Television Broadcasts Limited|TVB]]". The five of them starred together in the 1991 film ''[[The Tigers (film)|The Tigers]]''.

In 2009, a Taiwanese musical band called [[Wu Hu Jiang (band)|Wu Hu Jiang]] was formed. The five members starred as the Five Tiger Generals of Shu in the television series ''[[K.O.3an Guo]]'', which spoofs ''Romance of the Three Kingdoms'' in a modern school setting.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15427">The '''Frank Gardiner–Ben Hall Gang''' was an informal group of [[bushranger]]s who roamed the central west of [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]] in the 1860s. The gang was responsible for the largest gold robbery in Australia’s history at [[Eugowra, New South Wales|Eugowra Rocks]]. The gang had its origins in 1861; its demise came with the execution of [[John Dunn (bushranger)|John Dunn]] in 1866.

== Gang activities ==

John Peisley was born at Bathurst in 1835. While a teenager, he became a notorious horse thief in the area. He was convicted and sentenced to serve time on Cockatoo Island near [[Sydney]], where he met [[Frank Gardiner]].  In December 1860, Peisley gained his [[ticket of leave]], on the condition that he remain in the [[Hunter Region|Hunter River Valley]] area.  He absconded to the Abercrombie Ranges, where his parents once lived, and became a lone [[highwayman|highway robber]], "sticking up" travellers in the area south and west of [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]].

Gardiner was granted a ticket of leave in December 1859 on the condition of staying in the [[Carcoar, New South Wales|Carcoar]] district, and he soon joined up with Peisley. [[John Gilbert (bushranger)|Johnny Gilbert]] joined them soon afterwards, and the gang started stealing cattle and horses. Gardiner's [[ticket of leave]] was revoked when a warrant for his arrest for cattle stealing was issued.
 
Gardiner had a partnership with William Fogg in a butcher shop at Spring Creek. Gardiner supplied Fogg with stolen cattle, and Fogg would slaughter the cattle and sell the meat.

===1861===
*May: Gardiner, Peisley and Gilbert robbed mail in [[Cowra, New South Wales|Cowra]].
*16 July: Sgt. John Middleton and Constable William Hosie went to Fogg's house in search of Gardiner. He was briefly captured after a gunfight, but he was rescued by Peisley and John Gilbert, who ambushed the police on their return to town.
*25 December: Peisley shot William Benyon, who died seven days later.

===1862===
*29 January: Peisley was captured and committed for trial by the Carcoar bench for murdering an innkeeper at [[Bigga, New South Wales|Bigga]].  Within two months he was convicted and hanged at Bathurst.
*January: "The Three Jacks" &amp;ndash; Davis, McGuinness, and Connors &amp;ndash; committed their first robberies with Gardiner.
*10 April: Davis was wounded four times by police near [[Young, New South Wales|Lambing Flat]]. His companions, the other two Jacks, escaped.
*13 April: McGuiness was found dead near where Davis was captured; he had been shot.
*14 April: Gardiner, Hall, Youngman, and Gilbert robbed [[Wagon|dray]] near [[Forbes, New South Wales|Forbes]].
In 1862, John Gilbert was first named as an accomplice of Gardiner when they and two others held up a storekeeper.  Just over a month later, John Gilbert was involved in another robbery, this time with Gardiner and Ben Hall. From then on John Gilbert was identified as being involved in several hold-ups between Lambing Flat and Lachlan.
*25 April: Peisley was hanged in Bathurst.
[[Image:Escort Rock near Eugowra NSW.jpg|thumb|left|the location of the robbery at Eugowra Rocks]]
*15 June: Frank Gardiner enlisted the assistance of John Gilbert, Ben Hall, John O'Meally, Dan Charters, Henry Manns, Alexander Fordyce, and Johnny Bow to rob the Forbes gold escort, at a place called [[Eugowra, New South Wales|Eugowra Rocks]], of banknotes and 2700 ounces of gold worth more than £14,000.
*27 July: Hall and several others were arrested. Charters turned [[Queen's evidence]] but failed to name Hall or O'Meally.
*23 August: Hall was released. Gardiner left the district and moved to Queensland.

===1863===
*1 January: Fred Lowry shot a man whilst robbing the Brisbane Valley races (near the head of Fish River Creek) with John Foley. Lowry robbed settlers at Wambanamba. Lowry shot John Mcbride, who died from his leg wound.
* 13 February: Fred Lowry had been captured and placed in Bathurst Jail. On Feb 13 he had a mattock secreted into the jail and smashed a hole in the jail wall. Five prisoners escaped. Three escapees were caught that day. Fred Lowry and William Woodhart escaped capture. Lowry and Woodhart joined up with Gardiner.
*12 May: William Woodhart caught at Fowlow by Senior Constable Reilly and brought into Braidwood.
*13 July: Johnny Gilbert and John O'Meally, led by Ben Hall, held up the Commercial Bank at Carcoar.  A brave teller in the bank fired a shot into the ceiling of the bank, thwarting the robbery. The manager was shot outside the bank as he was returning to the bank, and the gang fled without seizing anything.  This was Australia's first bank robbery, and it took place in broad daylight.
*13 July: Lowry, with Cummins and John Foley, robbed the [[Mudgee, New South Wales|Mudgee]] mailcoach.
*August: John O'Meally shot dead John Barnes, a shopkeeper near [[Wallendbeen, New South Wales|Wallendbeen]].
*30 August: Fred Lowry died from wounds after a shootout with police at [[Crookwell, New South Wales|Crookwell]] the night before. Cummins was arrested.
*7 September: Francis Foley was sentenced to ten years "on the roads", with the first year in irons. Francis' brother, John Foley, was sentenced on the same day to fifteen years hard labour, with the first three in irons.
*23 September 1863, Patrick Daley sentenced to fifteen years on the roads
*27 September: First raid on Canowindra.
*1 October: John Gilbert, Ben Hall, John O’Meally, and two Mount Macquarie lads, John Vane and Micky Burke, held up a jeweller’s shop and the Sportsman’s Arms Hotel in Bathurst in broad daylight.  They exchanged shots with police as they made their escape down George Street.  Three days later they returned to rob more stores, houses, and hotels on the outskirts of the town.
*12 October: Hall and his gang bailed up Robinson's Hotel in [[Canowindra, New South Wales|Canowindra]] and held all the people of the town captive for three days. The hostages were allegedly not mistreated, and were provided with entertainment. The local policeman was subjected to humiliation by being locked in his own cell.  When the hostages were set free, the gang insisted on paying the hotelier and giving the townspeople "expenses".
*24 October: Twenty-year-old Michael Burke’s bushranging career ended at Rockley. Holding up Gold Commissioner Keightley, he was wounded in the stomach and, believing he was about to die, shot himself in the head.  While he was still alive and in pain, one of his friends killed him (the coroner named Hall as the person who fired the shot).
*3 November: Third raid on Canowindra.
*18 November: John Vane surrendered to police. Vane was sentenced to fifteen years; he was released in 1870.
*19 November: John O'Meally was shot dead during a raid on Goimbla station.
*December: Dunleavy and Mount joined the gang.

*3 February: Robbed the Murrumbah Inn and the Ploughed Ground Inn at Paddys River.
*6 February: Robbed the Braidwood mail coach south of Goulburn.
*24 February: Shootout with police at Byrnes’ farm in Mutbilly.
*4 March: Robbed the Gundaroo mail coach at Gearys Gap.
*13 March: The gang attempted to rob the Araluen escort at Majors Creek.
*17 March: The gang robbed Chinese miners at Little Wombat.
*18 March: The gang exchanged shots with police at Wallendbeen; Gilbert was wounded in the arm.
*25 March: Robbed Jones’s store at Forbes.
*9 April: Robbed Brazier’s Inn at Nubryan.
*10 April: Robbed Watts’s Inn, Austin’s inn, and Gallimore’s store at Black Rock.
*21 April: The gang robbed Yamma Station.
*May: Hall, Gilbert, and Dunn were proclaimed outlaws. The ''[[Felons Apprehension Act 1865|Felons Apprehension Act]]'' was passed, which allowed known [[bushrangers]] to be shot and killed rather than taken to trial. This put the members of the gang outside the law and liable to be killed by anyone.
*5 May: Hall had separated from the other two and later was surrounded by police and shot dead in the bush near Forbes .
*12 May: Gilbert and Dunn, on hearing the news of Hall's death, headed for Dunn's grandfather's property at Murrumbarrah.

*13 May: The [[Binalong, New South Wales|Binalong]] Police Station Senior Constable Charles Hales thought they might visit John Kelly, Dunn's grandfather. On the morning of the 13th of May, John Kelly informed Senior Constable Hales that Gilbert and Dunn were at his hut. Hales gathered Constables John Bright, Michael King, and Henry Hall and headed to Kelly's place. Two parties were formed: Bright and Hall went to the back of the hut and were stationed in the creek, while Hales and King were stationed at the front of the hut.

:As Hales and King approached the hut, the dogs started barking. Bushrangers ran out the back of the hut firing their guns, and kept up the fire as they got through a bush fence that led to the creek. They positioned themselves behind a large tree. Gilbert fired his revolving rifle at Hales and Bright, but it misfired. Meanwhile, King and Hall took up positions. Dunn and Gilbert started firing their revolvers at Hall and King and ran down to the creek. Hales and Bright immediately fired at the bushrangers; Gilbert was shot and died instantly.

:Hales ordered his men to follow and to chase Dunn. The three constables chased Dunn for about a mile and a half; they were exhausted and had to give up the pursuit. Dunn stole a horse from nearby Bogolong station and wasn't heard from again for seven months.

*18 December: Dunn was recognized by Police at McPhails Station near [[Walgett, New South Wales|Walgett]]. A week later on the 26th of December, after a gunfight with police, he was wounded and captured near [[Coonamble, New South Wales|Coonamble]].&lt;ref name=career/&gt; He was tried on 19 January 1866; the jury took ten minutes to find him guilty of murder, and he was sentenced to hang.  He was hanged in [[Darlinghurst Gaol]] on 19 March 1866.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/18702710 |title=Execution of Dunn |date=22 March 1866 |newspaper=[[The Maitland Mercury &amp; Hunter River General Advertiser]] |access-date=24 January 2013 |via=[[Trove]] |publisher=[[National Library of Australia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3154">'''Generación del 51''' is a designation for one of a series of "generations" of Spanish composers, identifying a group born between 1924 and 1938.

Members of this group of composers from the Basque and Castilian-speaking regions of Spain include {{harv|Perez Castillo|2001}}:
*[[Carmelo Bernaola|Carmelo Alonso Bernaola]] (1929–2002)
*{{Interlanguage link multi|Miguel Alonso (composer)|es|3=Miguel Alonso Gómez|lt=Miguel Alonso}} (1925–2002)
*[[Angel Arteaga]]
*[[Cristóbal Halffter]] (b. 1930)
*{{Interlanguage link multi|Ramón Barce|es}} (1928–2008)
*[[Agustín Bertomeu]] (b. 1929)
*{{Interlanguage link multi|Amando Blanquer|es|3=Amando Blanquer Ponsoda}} (1935–2005)
*{{Interlanguage link multi|Francisco Calés|es|3=Francisco Calés Otero}} (1925–1985)
*{{Interlanguage link multi|Manuel Castillo|es}} (1930–2005)
*[[Juan José Falcón Sanabria]] (b. 1936)
*[[Antón García Abril]] (b. 1933)
*{{Interlanguage link multi|Agustín González Acilu|es}} (b. 1929)
*[[Juan Hidalgo Codorniu|Juan Hidalgo]] (b. 1927)
*{{Interlanguage link multi|Ángel Oliver|es|3=Ángel Oliver Pina}} (1937–2005)
*[[Luis de Pablo]] (b. 1930)
*[[Claudio Prieto]] (b. 1934)
In their earlier works, members of this generation tended toward the avant-garde, with post-Webernian [[serialism]] evident in the work of Halffter and Luis de Pablo in particular. By the end of the 1970s a mellowing of their language becomes apparent, and during the 1980s many of them began to turn to [[tonality]] of one sort or another {{harv|Perez Castillo|2001}}. 

The Catalan members of this generation are associated with the reforming and renewing tendencies that emerged after the post-Civil War isolation ({{harvnb|Gómez|2001}}; {{harvnb|Perez Castillo|2001}}):
* {{Interlanguage link multi|Xavier Benguerel i Godó|ca}} (b. 1931)
* {{Interlanguage link multi|Joan Guinjoan Gispert|ca}} (b. 1931)
* [[Josep Mestres Quadreny]] (b. 1929)
* [[Josep Soler i Sardà]] (b. 1935)
Soler's compositional palette involves serial techniques, and he is particularly noted for his dramatic music {{harv|Perez Castillo|2001}}.

The '''Irvine''' family were agricultural pioneers and prominent [[landowner]]s in California who gave their name to the city of [[Irvine, California]].

==James Irvine I==
'''James Irvine''' (1827–1886) was born in [[County Down]], [[Ireland]] on December 27, 1827, the second to the youngest of nine children. When [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Ireland's potato crop failed]] in 1845, James Irvine and his younger brother William were among those who left for the [[United States]]. The family name is Scottish, meaning that James would have been an [[Ulster Scots people|Ulster Scot]], or [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]]. Irvine worked for two years in [[New York City]]. In 1848 Irvine went to join the [[California Gold Rush]] as a merchant and miner. In 1854, he purchased an interest in a [[San Francisco]] commission house on Front Street, operated by a relative, John Lyons. The business was renamed "Irvine &amp; Co., wholesale produce and grocery merchants". He began investing his profits in income-producing San Francisco real estate and soon became a wealthy man. Irvine also became a silent partner in the sheep-raising venture [[Flint, Bixby &amp; Company]] of brothers Thomas and Benjamin Flint, and their cousin [[Bixby land companies|Llewellyn Bixby]]. The purchase of the {{convert|48800|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[Rancho San Joaquin]] in 1864 and the {{convert|47200|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[Rancho Lomas de Santiago]] in 1866 marked the beginning of their operations in Southern California. In 1867, Irvine married Henrietta Maria (Nettie) Rice, the daughter of prominent [[Cleveland, Ohio]], educator, writer, poet and State Senator [[Harvey Rice]], who was a direct descendant of [[Edmund Rice (1638)|Edmund Rice]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=kt5779q2gb&amp;chunk.id=bioghist-1.8.3&amp;brand=oac Guide to the Rice Family Papers]&lt;/ref&gt; Nettie died in 1874, and Irvine married Margaret Byrne in 1880. He died March 15, 1886, and is buried in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;''Notables Of The West V2: Being The Portraits And Biographies Of The Progressive Men Of The West'', 1915, by International News Service&lt;/ref&gt;

==James Irvine II==
'''James Harvey Irvine, Sr.''' (1867–1947), son of James Irvine I and [[Harvey Rice|Henrietta Maria (Nettie) Rice]], was born October 16, 1867, in San Francisco.&lt;ref name=Blue&gt;[[Thomas William Herringshaw|Herringshaw, Thomas William]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=kykEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA293 ''American Elite and Sociologist Bluebook'', p. 293.] American Blue Book Publishers, 1922.&lt;/ref&gt; His mother died when he was seven years old, and his father died when he was about eighteen. Between the time of James Irvine I's death in 1886 and James Irvine II's inheritance of the Southern California real estate holdings upon his twenty-fifth birthday in 1892, the properties were supervised by James Irvine I's brother, George Irvine. James II bought out Flint and the other partners, and formed the [[Irvine Company]]. He married Frances Anita Plum in 1892, and they had three children, "Jase", James Harvey Irvine Jr. (1894–1935), Katharine Helena Irvine (1894–1920) and Myford Plum Irvine (1898–1959). In 1931, James II married Mrs. Kathryn Brown White, who died in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Cleland, Robert Glass. The Irvine Ranch of Orange County: 1810-1950. San Marino, Calif.: The Huntington Library, 1952, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; James II lived in San Francisco until the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]], when he relocated to the Irvine Ranch. He was a member of the [[Bohemian Club]], and kept a residence in San Francisco, at 2421 Pierce Street.&lt;ref name=Blue/&gt; He established the [[James Irvine Foundation]] in 1937, an entity dedicated to the "general well-being of the citizens and residents of the state of California." James II owned nearly a third of the land in present-day [[Orange County, California|Orange County]]. The city of [[Irvine, California|Irvine]] (formerly Myford) is named after him. He died of [[Bright's disease]] in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~npmelton/sfbirvi.htm James Irvine II]&lt;/ref&gt;

==James Irvine III==
'''James Harvey Irvine, Jr.''' (1894–1935) was groomed since a young man to take over the Ranch. He married Madeline Agassiz in 1914, but they were divorced in 1928. He married Athalie Richardson (1903–1993) in 1929, and they had one daughter, Athalie Anita "Joan" Irvine (1933– ). When James Irvine III died of tuberculosis in 1935, James II set up the James Irvine Foundation, a charitable organization to hold controlling stock in the Irvine Company. When James II died in 1947, Myford Plum Irvine (1898–1959),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSmid=1380347&amp;GRid=8286758&amp; Myford Plum Irvine @ find a grave]&lt;/ref&gt; James II's only surviving child, took over the presidency of the Irvine Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brower |first=Martin A |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The Irvine Ranch : a time for people : a 50-year overview of the development of the Irvine Ranch |year=1994 |publisher= |quote= | url= |isbn=978-0-9641326-0-3 }}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4472">'''Keaweaweʻulaokalani''' is a name shared by two short-lived princes and heirs to the throne of the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]]. Both were named after their father [[Kamehameha III]]. In [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]], the name means "the red trail of heaven", signifying the roadway by which the god descends from heaven.

'''Keaweaweʻulaokalani I''' (1839–1839) was the eldest son of [[Kamehameha III]] and his queen consort [[Kalama Hakaleleponi-i-Kapakuhaili]].  The baby boy was named after his father whose full name was Keaweawe{{okina}}ula Kiwala{{okina}}o Kauikeaouli Kaleiopapa Kalani Waiakua Kalanikau Iokikilo Kiwala{{okina}}o i ke kapu Kamehameha.  The royal suffix o-Kalani was added in to signified this Prince of [[Heaven]].

The young Prince Keawe died shortly after his birth. His death left Kamehameha III again childless. His younger brother, Keaweaweʻulaokalani II, would not be born until 1842.

'''Keaweaweʻulaokalani II''' (1842–1842) was the second son of [[Kamehameha III]] and his queen consort [[Kalama Hakaleleponi-i-Kapakuhaili]].  The baby boy was the namesake of his father and his brother.

Initially given in ''[[hānai]]'' to [[Kalākua Kaheiheimālie]], he was instead adopted or ''hānai'' by his grand aunt, [[Kekāuluohi]] and her husband [[Charles Kanaina|Kana{{okina}}ina]] when the old governess of Maui died not three days after his birth. The King promised that he would be sent to the [[Chiefs' Children's School]] once he was weaned and could walk. He soon developed a fever and died, at the age of only 31 days. Dr. Baldwin of Lahaina was convinced that the child was killed by traditional medicinal treatment.

On 21 November 2013 [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] from the [[National Crime Agency#Organisational Structure|Human Trafficking Unit]] arrested two suspects at a residential address in [[Lambeth]], [[South London]]. A 73-year-old ethnic Indian [[Singaporean]] man, Aravindan Balakrishnan, and a 67-year-old [[Tanzanian]]&lt;ref name = "growing up"/&gt; woman, his wife, Chanda Pattni, had been investigated for [[slavery]] and [[domestic servitude]].&lt;ref name="Halliday"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Standard"/&gt; The case centred around the [[Workers' Institute of Marxism–Leninism–Mao Zedong Thought]] commune which was led by Balakrishnan. In the early 1980s after a police raid, Balakrishnan decided to move the group's activities underground. Balakrishnan's control over his followers intensified and the commune became a prison to his followers.  On 25 October 2013, three women were rescued from the commune. These were: a 69-year-old [[Malaysians in the United Kingdom|Malaysian]] woman (later revealed to be Aishah Wahab),&lt;ref name="Sawer"/&gt; a 57-year-old [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] woman (Josephine Herivel) and a 30-year-old [[United Kingdom|British]] woman (Katy Morgan-Davies).&lt;ref name="Standard"&gt;{{cite news |title=Women victims 'held for 30 years' |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/panewsfeeds/women-victims-held-for-30-years-8954976.html |publisher=London Evening Standard |date=21 November 2013 |accessdate=21 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Katy Morgan-Davies was born into the sect and hadn't experienced the outside world until her release.

==Perpetrator==
'''Aravindan Balakrishnan''' (known to his followers as "'''Comrade Bala'''") was born in [[Kerala]], [[India]] but migrated to  [[Singapore]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]], where his father was a soldier, when he was 10.&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ward|first1=Victoria|title=Aravindan Balakrishnan: the Maoist cult leader who used brutal violence and rape to strip women of their dignity|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/12031312/Aravindan-Balakrishnan-the-Maoist-cult-leader-who-used-brutal-violence-and-rape-to-strip-women-of-their-dignity.html|accessdate=5 June 2017|work=The Telegraph|date=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Balakrishnan was a student at [[Raffles Institution]] and later the [[University of Singapore]], where although gaining a reputation as a "quiet chap",&lt;ref name="Reuters-AO"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Reuters|title=UK Maoist cult leader raped followers, enslaved daughter|url=http://www.asiaone.com/world/uk-maoist-cult-leader-raped-followers-enslaved-daughter|accessdate=5 June 2017|work=AsiaOne|date=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; he became increasingly politically active and believed that he would have been imprisoned in Singapore had he openly admitted to being a [[communist]].&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt; In 1977, while living in London, His Singaporean citizenship – which he gained in 1960 – was revoked due to his leadership of the [[Workers' Institute of Marxism–Leninism–Mao Zedong Thought]], which the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Singapore)|Ministry of Home Affairs]] accused of engaging in "activities which are prejudicial to the security" of Singapore, and denounced him as a radical "closely associated with [[Eurocommunists]]".&lt;ref name="Reuters-AO" /&gt; The authorities claimed that Balakrishnan and others, many of them former Singaporean students he had associated with in London, were plotting to overthrow Singapore's leader, [[Lee Kuan Yew]].&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt;

Despite believing the United Kingdom to be a [[fascist state]] due to its treatment of the people of Singapore during the [[Malayan Emergency]], Balakrishnan emigrated to the UK in 1963 on a [[British Council]] scholarship to study at the [[London School of Economics]], and married his wife Chandra in 1971.&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt; Over the years he built up a following by giving lectures and staging various [[sit-in]]s and protests. He was a regular attendee at [[London]] demonstrations, where he waved banners depicting the Chinese leader [[Mao Zedong]] and addressed the crowds.&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt;

In 1974, Balakrishnan and his "small clique" were expelled from the [[Communist Party of England (Marxist–Leninist)]] on account of "their pursuance of conspiratorial and [[wikt:splittist|splittist]] activities ... spreading [[social fascist]] slanders against the Party and the proletarian movement" and attempting "to put themselves above the discipline of the Party".&lt;ref name="CPE(M-L) statement"&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/history/erol/uk.hightide/cpestatements.htm "Statements of the National Executive Committee, CPE (ML)"], ''The Marxist-Leninist'', 1:1, September 1974, reprinted at marxists.org. Quoted in Nick Cohen [http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/nick-cohen/2013/11/cultists-communists-too-close-to-us-for-comfort/ "Cultists &amp; communists – too close to us for comfort"], ''The Spectator'' (blog), 25 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The CPE(M–L) "repudiated the metaphysical logic harmfully promoted" by Balakrishnan in "opposition to dialectical materialism and the concrete analysis of concrete conditions".&lt;ref name="CPE(M-L) statement"/&gt; In response, Balakrishnan set up the Workers' Institute and launched his own publication, the ''South London Workers' Bulletin'', which accused the CPE(M–L) of being "fascists" and "agents of imperialism".&lt;ref name="Ford-WW-989"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ford|first1=Eddie|title=Maoist 'slaves': Combating the fascist state in Brixton  - Weekly Worker|url=http://weeklyworker.co.uk/worker/989/maoist-slaves-combating-the-fascist-state-in-brixt/|accessdate=5 June 2017|work=Weekly Worker|issue=989|date=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1974 and 1976, his followers attempted to "build revolutionary stable base areas in working-class communities",&lt;ref name="On Building a"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Workers’ Institute of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought|title=On Building a Revolutionary Stable Base Area|url=https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/uk.hightide/stable-base.htm|work=Encyclopedia of Anti-Revisionism On-Line|year=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; primarily [[South London]], and worked in ordinary jobs. Balakrishnan discouraged his followers from joining [[trade unions]], describing them as agents of the "imperialist fascist bourgeoisie".&lt;ref name="Smith-Conv"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Evan|title=Inside the paranoid Maoist cults of 1970s Britain|url=http://theconversation.com/inside-the-paranoid-maoist-cults-of-1970s-britain-20739|accessdate=5 June 2017|work=The Conversation|date=28 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, after the more liberal members of his group drifted away, a cult of around 10 female members formed around him. The collective moved to Brixton in 1976, under the title [[Workers Institute of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought]].&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt; Following [[Mao Zedong#Death and aftermath|Mao's death in 1976]], the Institute built the Mao Zedong Memorial Centre at 140 Acre Lane, [[Brixton]], which also functioned as a communist collective of "thirteen comrades", with "13 members living on the premises, half in paid work, six doing full-time revolutionary work, with a strong emphasis on women taking a leading role (apart from leading the Party Committee headed by Bala)".&lt;ref name="On Building a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith-Conv" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=High Tide: The Consolidation of Maoism by the Late 1970’s|url=https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/uk.hightide/|accessdate=5 June 2017|work=Encyclopedia of Anti-Revisionism On-Line}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members were handed a rota of chores and only allowed to go out in pairs, which Balakrishnan claimed was because the area they lived in was "notorious for violence" and "anything could happen".&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ward|first1=Victoria|title=Maoist 'cult' leader denies rape as he claims female commune members competed for his affections|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/12019410/Maoist-cult-leader-denies-rape-as-he-claims-female-commune-members-competed-for-his-affections.html|accessdate=5 June 2017|work=Telegraph|date=26 November 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a police raid on the Memorial Centre in March 1978, which the group claimed  involved "over 200 police", including officers from the [[Special Patrol Group]], "under the pretext of searching for drugs", the Workers' Institute effectively went underground, with the remaining members being convinced to end all contact with others and maintain an intense level of secrecy.&lt;ref name="Smith-Conv" /&gt; Family members were later branded fascist agents and ostracised,&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt; and Balakrishnan and his captives moved to a number of properties during this time as a means for him to escape detection from the authorities.&lt;ref name="Smith-Conv" /&gt; Balakrishnan convinced his followers that everything was controlled by him from the sun, the moon, wind and fires; that he could overthrow governments, control natural disasters, and make people live or die.&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt; In order to progress his cause, Balakrishnan invented "JACKIE" (an acronym for [[Jehovah]], [[Allah]], [[Christ]], [[Krishna]] and [[Eknath Easwaran|Immortal Easwaran]]) – a type of dangerous, mystical machine that monitored all thought and could control minds.&lt;ref name="Cooke"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cooke|first1=Rachel|title=My 30 years as prisoner of a London cult|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jan/22/katy-morgan-davies-interview-balakrishnan-cult-brixton-survivor|accessdate=5 June 2017|work=The Guardian|date=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Balakrishnan began sexually abusing two of the women in 1979, often physically beating them and making others watch as he did so. All of the women were beaten and four (not including his wife) were said to have been sexually assaulted or engaged with sexual relations with him.&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt; Balakrishnan forced the women to swallow his ejaculate as it was "the elixir of life", and claimed the women he sexually abused had been trying to seduce him out of "jealousy" for his lover.&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele2" /&gt;

==Victims==
*[[Katy Morgan-Davies]] - born in 1983, she was originally named Prem Maopinduzi Davies. She began calling herself "Rosie" in her teens. She has subsequently changed her name to Katy Morgan-Davies, after the American singer [[Katy Perry]]. She is the biological daughter of Balakrishnan and Sian Davies.&lt;ref name = "growing up"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-b0af7ef5-1031-4e1f-a3ac-b3c21ef0f932|title=Growing up a prisoner in a cult|date=26 January 2017|accessdate=28 January 2017|author=Vanessa Engle|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan-Davies was brought up entirely isolated from the outside world and never went to a nursery, school, dentist or doctor. She was not told who her parents were. The commune members taught her to read and write.&lt;ref name=bbc2&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-b0af7ef5-1031-4e1f-a3ac-b3c21ef0f932&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Sian Davies]] - in the early 1980s, after joining the commune, she had a sexual relationship with Balakrishnan.  On Christmas Eve 1996, Morgan-Davies remembered seeing Davies bound and gagged on the living room for trying to escape. Later, she fell out of a top floor bathroom window and was taken to hospital. In hospital she suffered a rapid decline in her mental health and fell into a coma. She died eight months later.  After the fall, her family were told she had gone to India to do charity work.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} At the time of Davie's death her daughter, Morgan-Davies, did not know she was her mother.

*[[Aishah Wahab]] - a [[Malaysians|Malaysian]] woman who moved to the United Kingdom at the age of 24 to study, joining the group shortly after.&lt;ref name = "growing up"/&gt; Aishah was reportedly so drawn in by Balakrishnan's Marxist rhetoric that she left her fiancé and moved in with the collective.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

*[[Oh Kar Eng]] - nurse from [[Malaysia]] who had followed Balakrishnan from the 1970s. She hit her head on a cupboard in 2001 and suffered a stroke. No medical treatment was allowed by the commune and she died the next day.{{r|bbc}} The police were not informed of the accident. Her family were not told about her cremation, and they were told the commune did not have their ashes when in fact they were in a lockup garage in West Norwood.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

*[[Josephine Herivel]] - known as Josie, was a violinist studying at the [[Royal College of Music]] before she joined the group.&lt;ref name = "growing up"/&gt; Her father, [[John Herivel]] was one of the [[Bletchley Park]] [[codebreakers]] who helped Britain and its allies win [[World War II]]. She is believed to have moved to London in the 1970s and disowned her family after becoming involved with the Workers' Institute of Marxism–Leninism–Mao Zedong Thought.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Herivel initiated the escape plan after becoming concerned with Morgan-Davies rapid weight loss (which was due to undiagnosed diabetes). Medical treatment was not permitted by the commune. Herivel secretly phoned a helpline after memorizing the number from a television program. Herivel has denounced the Balakrishnan sentencing, claiming he has been framed by the state.{{r|bbc}}

==Imprisonment and rescue==
The two older victims are believed to have met Balakrishnan in [[London]] through, according to police, a shared political ideology,&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;Martin Evans [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/10472632/Slavery-case-suspects-named-as-former-Maoist-collective-leaders.html "Slavery case: suspects named as former Maoist collective leaders"], telegraph.co.uk, 25 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; as he was the leader of the [[Workers' Institute of Marxism–Leninism–Mao Zedong Thought]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/news/slave-house-couple-lambeth-leaders-1970s-political-cult 'Slave' house couple 'leaders of 1970s political cult'"], ''[[Channel 4 News]]'', 25 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  The women were not being physically restrained, but held by "invisible handcuffs" after being subjected to [[Mind control|brainwashing]], [[Psychological abuse|emotional abuse]] and [[physical abuse]] by their captors.&lt;ref name="Standard_2"&gt;{{cite news |title=London slave women endured 30 years of beatings, brainwashing and emotional control |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/london-slave-women-endured-30-years-of-beatings-brainwashing-and-emotional-control-8956001.html |publisher=London Evening Standard |date=22 November 2013 |accessdate=23 November 2013 |first=Justin |last=Davenport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two anime series, LINE OFFLINE and LINE TOWN, were produced in 2013, picturing the Line Friends as employees for the fictional Line Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://jpninfo.com/31855|title=Love LINE Friends?

=== Line Offline ===
Line Offline is an animated series created by [[Shogakukan Productions]], based on [[salaryman]] characters working at "Line Corporation". All 114 episodes last about three minutes. The series was aired from January 8, 2013, to October 1, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/04/07/line-offline/|title=Messaging App Line’s Kawaii Characters Get Their Own Cartoon Series In Japan – TechCrunch|website=techcrunch.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episodes of Line Offline are not connected to each other. The idea behind the series is to represent the ordinary life of company employees (in this case Line's employees, that's why the series is called "Line Offline"), in which every small problem could lead to weird and funny situations that require some effort in order to restore the [[status quo]].

Most characters from Line Offline are part of Line's universe (the characters who are shown in the animated series are also Line Friends, and they can be seen by users in Line Messaging App and used as emoticons).

The '''mermahuataur''' is a mythological creature created by graphic designer Jim Unwin and writer Dylan Carline.

It first appeared in their [[Euler diagram]] of [https://www.flickr.com/photos/preshaa/3847027500/ mythical creatures] that achieved significant popularity as an [[internet meme]] and in 2009 [http://theridiculant.metro.co.uk/2009/08/enter-the-mermahuataur.html appeared in print] in London's [[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro newspaper]].

The mermahuataur, based on the combinations given in the mythical creature diagram, is farcically described as being 'half [[human]], half [[bull]], half [[narwhal]]'.

Since the publishing of the Euler diagram, the Mermahuataur has been imagined and drawn by various artists and designers. Notably, it is now part of the web-site for the [[PlayStation 3]] game, [[LittleBigPlanet (PlayStation 3)|LittleBigPlanet]]. It shows a mermahuataur drawn by [[Rex Crowle]] on its [https://web.archive.org/web/20110301080611/http://www.littlebigplanet.com/en/404/ HTTP 404 Error page].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5977">'''Metabiography''' is the literary study of the relation of [[Biography|biographies]] to the temporal, geographical, institutional, intellectual or ideological locations of their writers (the biographers). It is a [[hermeneutics]] of biography that sees the biographical subject (the “biographee”) as a collective construct of different [[cultural memory|memory cultures]], proposing an essential instability of historical lives.&lt;ref&gt;Rupke, Nicolaas, 2008. ''Alexander von Humboldt: A Metabiography'' (corrected edition). Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of [[Steven Shapin]], metabiography stresses “that shifting biographical traditions make one person have many lives,” none of these necessarily more real than any other, because all are “configured and reconfigured according to the sensibilities and needs of the changing cultural settings.”&lt;ref&gt;Shapin, Steven, 2006. “Lives after death,” ''Nature'', vol. 441: 286.&lt;/ref&gt;   In this sense, metabiography expresses a belief in the observer-dependence of historical knowledge.

== Metabiography vs. traditional biography ==
As part of the preparations for their own writings, biographers have traditionally examined previous biographical studies. For these authors, dealing with predecessors has served such purposes as establishing the factual inadequacy of earlier efforts, staking one’s own claim against prior “myths” and “mistakes,” or has been intended simply as laying the groundwork for a new and more “definitive” study. Metabiography, however, goes beyond writing about the strengths or weaknesses of preceding biographical studies in interpreting a life. It is less concerned with the authenticity of biographical representations than with their relational nature.&lt;ref&gt;Rupke, Nicolaas, 2008. ''Alexander von Humboldt: A Metabiography'' (corrected edition). Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; 
It has been argued that in the history of science, metabiography has a long tradition of over fifty years,&lt;ref&gt;Söderqvist, Thomas, 2007. Untitled review of Nicolaas A. Rupke, ''Alexander von Humboldt: a Metabiography'', ''Isis'', vol. 98: 203-204; Söderqvist however defines metabiography as the critical appraisal of biographical literature about a particular person in the traditional way.&lt;/ref&gt; stretching from [[Henry Guerlac]]’s study of “[[Lavoisier]] and his biographers”&lt;ref&gt;Guerlac, Henry, 1954. “Lavoisier and his biographers,” ''Isis'', vol. 45: 51-62.&lt;/ref&gt; to A. Rupert Hall’s edition of eighteenth-century [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] biographies&lt;ref&gt;Hall, A. Rupert, 1999. ''Isaac Newton: Eighteenth-Century Perspectives''. Oxford [etc.]: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  and beyond. However, to these scholars, the study of former biographers had a [[Propaedeutics|propaedeutic]] function vis-à-vis the biographical works of their own time. They did not follow a relational approach and thus do not meet the crucial criterion for metabiographical studies.

== Examples of metabiography in general history ==
In the field of biographies of artists and writers, the metabiographical approach was followed e.g. by David Dennis for [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] (1770–1827),&lt;ref&gt;Dennis, David B., 1996. ''Beethoven in German Politics, 1870-1989''. New Haven and London: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Lucasta Miller]] who used it to good effect in the case [[Emily Brontë]] (1818–48).&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Lucasta, 2001. ''The Brontë Myth''. London: Cape&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Gordon S. Wood]]’s study on the Americanization of [[Benjamin Franklin]],&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Gordon S., 2004. ''The Americanization of Benjamin Franklin''. New York, NY: Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt; however, is not metabiography, although the Franklin literature would provide ideal material for such a study.

== Examples of metabiography in the field of scientific biography ==
Examples of scientific metabiography are [[Jan Sapp]]’s “The nine lives of [[Gregor Mendel]],”&lt;ref&gt;Sapp, Jan, 1990. “The nine lives of Gregor Mendel” in Le Grand, Homer E. (ed.), ''Experimental Inquiries''. Dordrecht: Kluwer, pp. 137-166. Sapp analyses the different interpretations of Mendel’s work in genetics by later practitioners in the field, who variously described him as a Darwinian, a non-Darwinian, an evolutionist, an opponent of evolutionary theory, a Mendelian geneticist, not a Mendelian geneticist, a man who did or did not falsify his data or even as someone who completely fabricated his experiments on plant hybrids.&lt;/ref&gt; Patricia Fara’s ''Newton: the Making of Genius''&lt;ref&gt;Fara, Patricia, 2002. ''Newton: the Making of Genius''. London: Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Nicolaas Adrianus Rupke|Nicolaas Rupke]]’s ''Alexander von Humboldt: a Metabiography''.&lt;ref&gt;Rupke, Nicolaas, 2008. ''Alexander von Humboldt: A Metabiography'' (corrected edition). Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press; Rupke shows how from the middle of the nineteenth century to the present day Humboldt has served as a nucleus of crystallisation for a variety of successive socio-political ideologies in Germany.&lt;/ref&gt; James Moore and Ralph Colp have applied the metabiographical approach to Charles Darwin.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, James, 1994. ''The Darwin Legend''. Grand Rapids, Michigan: Baker Books; Moore, James, 1999. “Telling tales: Evangelicals and the Darwin legend” in Livingstone, David N., Hart, D.G., and Noll, Mark A. (eds), ''Evangelicals and Science in Historical Perspective''. New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 220-233; Colp, Ralph, 1989. “Charles Darwin’s past and future biographies,” ''History of Science'', vol. 27: 167-197.&lt;/ref&gt;  A metabiographical slant is also discernible in the ''Reader’s Guide to the History of Science'' (2000).

The procedures and ease of a name change vary between jurisdictions. In general, [[common law]] jurisdictions have loose procedures for a name change while [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions are more restrictive.

A [[pseudonym]] is a name that differs from the original or true name and does not require legal sanction. It is generally adopted to conceal a person's identity, but can also be done for personal, social or ideological reasons.

==Reasons for changing one's name==
* Marriage or civil partnership. 
* To avoid a [[stalker]] or [[harassment|harassing]] person.
* To choose a surname associated with a hobby, interest, or accomplishment (e.g., old name Henry Schifberg, new name [[Henry Lizardlover]])
* To receive an inheritance conditional on adopting the name of the deceased (this reason was once quite common in landowning families in the UK)
* To replace a frivolous name given by their parents (e.g., old name Mikey Maus, new name Marcus Maus)
* To replace a name which might be considered undesirable with a more desirable one (e.g. old surname Lipschitz, new surname London)
* To dissociate oneself from a former religion (e.g., Ahmed Abdullah to Adel Karim) 
* To dissociate themselves from a famous or infamous person (e.g., old name [[Michael Jackson]] new name Martin Jackson)
* To identify with a famous or infamous person (e.g., old name Simon Johnson, new name Simon [[King Arthur|Pendragon]])
* To dissociate themselves from a family [[Black sheep (term)|black sheep]] (e.g., relatives of [[Adolf Hitler]]).
* To dissociate themselves from an ethnic origin (e.g. changing [[Battenberg family|Battenberg]] to [[Mountbatten]] or Jan Ludvik Hoch to [[Robert Maxwell]]).
* To revert to a former name (e.g., [[Cynthia Lennon]], first wife of [[John Lennon]], after her divorce from later husband John Twist).
* Commercial sponsorship (e.g., [[Jimmy White]] temporarily became Jimmy Brown for [[HP Sauce|HP brown sauce]],&lt;ref name="BBCBrown1"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/funny_old_game/4245973.stm "Jimmy Gets Saucy with Name Change"], no by-line, ''BBC News'' (online edition), "Sport: Fun and Games" section, 8 February 2005; accessed 14 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ashley Revell]] became Ashley blue square Revell for [[The Rank Group]]'s Blue Square service)
* Protest or activism (e.g., old name Jennifer Taylor, new name Jennifer [[Environmentalism|Save the Forests]])
* To change to a fictional character's name, (e.g. old name Tracy Darling, new name [[Tracy Beaker]])
* To make their name more attractive or "catchy" so as to increase their chance of success (see [[Stage name]])
* To change legal name to one used in everyday life, (e.g. where middle name has been used throughout life)
* To better fit one's [[gender identity]] as a [[transgender]] person (e.g., old name Bruce Jenner, new name [[Caitlyn Jenner]])

==United States==
In the United States, [[State law (United States)|state law]]s regulate name changes. Several federal court rulings have set precedents regarding both court decreed name changes and common law name changes (changing the name at will), including ''[[Lindon v. First National Bank]]''.

Usually a person can adopt any name desired for any reason. As of 2009, 46 states allow a person legally to change names by usage alone, with no paperwork, but a court order may be required for many institutions (such as banks or government institutions) to officially accept the change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Julia Shear|last=Kushner|url=https://uclalawreview.org/pdf/57-1-7.pdf|title=The Right to Control One's Name|work=[[UCLA Law Review]]|issue=313|year=2009|pages=324–9}} The states which require a statutory name-change procedure are Hawaii, Louisiana, Maine, and Oklahoma.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the states (except Louisiana) follow common law, there are differences in acceptable requirements; usually a [[court order]] is the most efficient way to change names (which would be applied for in a [[State court (United States)|state court]]), except at marriage, which has become a universally accepted reason for a name change. It is necessary to [[pleading|plead]] that the name change is not for a [[fraud]]ulent or other illegal purpose, such as evading a [[lien]] or [[debt]] or for [[defamation|defaming]] someone else.

Applicants may be required to give a reasonable explanation for wanting to change their names. A fee is generally payable, and the applicant may be required to post legal notices in newspapers to announce the name change. Generally the judge has limited [[judicial discretion]] to grant or deny a change of name, usually only if the name change is for fraudulent, frivolous or [[Morality|immoral]] purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Edward J. Bander, ''Change of Name and Law of Names'' (Dobbs Ferry, New York: Oceana Publications, 1973) Ch. 2&amp;ndash;3.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2004, a [[Missouri]] man succeeded in changing his name to They.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/offbeat/2004-09-23-name-change_x.htm|work=USA Today|title=Missouri man legally changes his name to 'They'}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Minnesota Supreme Court]] ruled that a name change to 1069 could be denied, but that Ten Sixty-Nine was acceptable (''Application of Dengler'', 1979); the [[North Dakota Supreme Court]] had denied the same request several years before (''Petition of Dengler'', 1976).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.court.state.nd.us/court/opinions/9205.htm|title=Petition of Dengler, 246 N.W.2d 758 (N.D. 1976)|work=state.nd.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In nearly all states, a person cannot choose a name that is intended to mislead (such as adopting a celebrity's name), that is intentionally confusing, or that incites violence; nor can one adopt, as a name, a [[racial slur]], a threat, or an [[obscene|obscenity]].

Some examples of typically allowed reasons for name changes in the U.S. include:
* Adopting a new surname upon marriage (typically the surname of the spouse, a [[hyphenated name|hyphenated surname]], or some combination of parts of both surnames).
* Returning to the use of a prior surname (e.g., a [[maiden name]]) upon divorce.
* Simplification or improved familiarity of spelling or pronunciation.

Under the federal immigration-and-nationality law, when aliens apply for [[naturalization]], they have the option of asking for their names to be changed upon the grants of citizenship with no additional fees. This allows them the opportunity to adopt more [[Cultural assimilation#Immigrant name changing as a form of assimilation|Americanized]] names.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.uscis.gov/files/form/n-400.pdf N-400 Application for Naturalization]", (US Citizenship and Immigration Services, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; During the naturalization interview, a petition for a name change is prepared to be forwarded to a [[United States federal courts|federal court]]. Applicants certify that they are not seeking a change of name for any unlawful purpose such as the avoidance of debt or evasion of [[Police|law enforcement]]. Such a name change would become final if within their jurisdiction, once a [[United States federal courts|federal court]] naturalizes an applicant.

To maintain a person's [[identity (social science)|identity]], it is desirable to obtain a formal order so there is continuity of personal records.

===Informal methods of legal name change===

====Assumed name====
The "open and notorious" use of a name is often sufficient to allow one to use an [[assumed name]]. In some jurisdictions, a trade name distinct from one's legal name can be registered with a county clerk, [[Secretary of State (U.S. state government)|secretary of state]], or other similar government authority. Persons who wish to publish materials and not to be associated with them may publish under [[pseudonym]]s; such a right is protected under [[case law]] pursuant to [[United States Constitution]].

====Usage method====
A common law name (i.e. one assumed for a non-fraudulent purpose) is a legal name.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', ''State v. Ford'', 172 P. 802; ''Bonnie Lee Daniels'', 337 A.2d 49; ''Elizabeth Marie Hauptly'' 312 N.E.2d 857; ''Piotrowski v. Piotrowski'', 247 N.W.2d 354; ''Thomas v. Thomas'', 427 N.E.2d 1009; ''Klein v. Klein'', 373 A.2d 86; ''Stuart v. Board of Elections'', 295 A.2d 223.&lt;/ref&gt; In most states a statutory method, while quick and definitive, only supplements the common law method,&lt;ref&gt;''In Matter of Linda A.'', 480 N.Y.S.2d 996.&lt;/ref&gt; unless the statute makes itself exclusive. Although a person may sue under a common law name.&lt;ref&gt;''Hoffman v. Bank of America'', (M.D. Florida 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[California]] the "usage method" (changing the name at will under common law) is sufficient to change the name.  Not all jurisdictions require that the new name be used exclusively.&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''Kreuter v US'', 201 F2d 33 (true name need not be abandoned), Florida Statute 322.22 (driver's licenses in two names), ''Loser v. Plainfield'', 128 N.W. 1101 (Iowa), ''Ludwinska v John Hancock'', 317 Pa 577 (may be used for just one nonfraudulent transaction).&lt;/ref&gt; Any fraudulent use or intent, such as changing the name to the same name as another person's name, may invalidate this type of name change.

Specifically in California, Code of Civil Procedure § 1279.5 and Family Code § 2082 regulate common law and court decreed name changes. Code of Civil Procedure § 1279.5 (a) reads, "Except as provided in subdivision (b), (c), (d), or (e), nothing in this title shall be construed to abrogate the common law right of any person to change his or her name." Subdivisions b through e preclude one from changing their name by common law if they are in state prison, on probation, on parole, or have been convicted of a serious sex offense. If a person is not in any of these categories, then a common law name change is allowed. (Family Code § 2082 also contains some of the same wording.)

====Preferred name====
Many universities, hospitals, and other institutions allow one to use a "preferred name" instead of one's legal name.  This name can show up on class rosters, online learning platforms, and student [[ID card]]s.  It provides a "transitional"
name change for those who have yet to, or cannot, receive a court-ordered name change.&lt;ref name="UC Davis"&gt;{{cite web|title=Preferred Name {{!}} Office of the University Registrar|url=https://registrar.ucdavis.edu/records/preferred-name.cfm|website=registrar.ucdavis.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leicester"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a preferred first name or preferred last name? — University of Leicester|url=http://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/hr/policies/ess/Questions/what-is-a-preferred-first-name-or-preferred-last-name|website=www2.le.ac.uk|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Official registration===
A legal name change is merely the first step in the name-change process. A person must officially register the new name with the appropriate authorities whether the change was made as a result of a court order, marriage, divorce, adoption, or any of the other methods described above. The process includes notifying various government agencies, each of which may require legal proof of the name change and that may or may not charge a fee. Important government agencies to be notified include the [[Social Security Administration]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://faq.ssa.gov/link/portal/34011/34019/Article/3749/|title=How do I change or correct my name on my Social Security number card?|work=ssa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bureau of Consular Affairs]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/passport/npic/agencies/agencies_913.html|title=U.S. Passports &amp; International Travel|work=state.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; (for passports), the [[Federal Communications Commission]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transition.fcc.gov/Forms/Form605/605.html|title=FCC Form 605|author=FCC Internet Services Staff|work=fcc.gov|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422032207/http://transition.fcc.gov/Forms/Form605/605.html|archivedate=2014-04-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Selective Service System]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sss.gov/regisrantsbk.htm#RegistrantObligations|title=Selective Service System: Registrant Obligations|website=www.sss.gov|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329020540/http://www.sss.gov/regisrantsbk.htm#RegistrantObligations|archivedate=2015-03-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Department of Motor Vehicles (for a new driver's license, learner permit, state identification card, or vehicular registration). Additionally the new name must be registered with other institutions such as employers, banks, doctors, mortgage, insurance and credit card companies. Online services are available to assist in this process either through direct legal assistance or automated form processing.

Although state requirements differ, it is generally recommended to first register a new name with the Social Security office as some state motor-vehicle departments require updated social security cards to make changes; [[Arizona]] is one of these states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azdot.gov/mvd/faqs/scripts/faqs.asp?section=dl#1|title=Motor Vehicle Services|work=azdot.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most states require name changes to be registered with their departments of motor vehicles (DMVs) within a certain amount of time. For example, [[South Carolina]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scdmvonline.com/DMVNew/default.aspx?n=general_driver_license_information#NameorAddressChanges {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228092155/http://www.scdmvonline.com/DMVNew/default.aspx?n=general_driver_license_information |date=2012-12-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wyoming]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://dot.state.wy.us/Default.jsp?sCode=drvna] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070919202553/http://dot.state.wy.us/Default.jsp?sCode=drvna|date=September 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; require a name change be registered with their office within ten days. [[Illinois]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyberdriveillinois.com/publications/rules_of_the_road/rr_chap01.html#changing_name_address] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070427004533/http://www.cyberdriveillinois.com/publications/rules_of_the_road/rr_chap01.html#changing_name_address|date=April 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Texas]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.txdps.state.tx.us/administration/driver_licensing_control/faq/answers_dl_id.htm#q18] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012023946/http://www.txdps.state.tx.us/administration/driver_licensing_control/faq/answers_dl_id.htm#q18|date=October 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vermont]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dmv.vermont.gov/licenses/change-name-address|title=Change Address or Name on Your License – Department of Motor Vehicles|website=dmv.vermont.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; require it be registered within 30&amp;nbsp;days, while [[North Carolina]] allows up to 60&amp;nbsp;days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdot.org/dmv/driver_services/drivershandbook/chapter1/renewalLicense.html#RDNameChanges|title=NCDOT: License and ID|work=[[North Carolina Department of Transportation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New York (state)|New York]] requires visiting a local motor vehicle office to change the name on all records and documents, but without a definite deadline to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dmv.ny.gov/dmvfaqs.htm#name|title=New York State DMV|work=New York State DMV|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626065446/http://www.dmv.ny.gov/dmvfaqs.htm#name|archivedate=2012-06-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fees for registering a new name vary from state to state. The forms, along with the state-specific requirements, can generally be obtained for free.

Many states will require reasons for wanting a name change. For example, in Florida, a court will not grant a petition for a change of name if it finds that (i) the petitioner has ulterior or illegal motives in seeking the name change, (ii) the petitioner's civil rights are suspended, or (iii) granting the name change will invade the property rights (''e.g.'', intellectual property rights) of others.&lt;ref&gt;see, e.g., [http://abcfamilylaw.com/practice-areas/change-of-name www.abcfamilylaw.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128015829/http://www.abcfamilylaw.com/practice-areas/change-of-name |date=2010-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]], citizens and residents have the freedom to change their names with relative ease.

In theory, anyone who is at least 16 and resident in the United Kingdom can call themselves whatever they wish. However, over the past hundred years or so, formal procedures that are recognized by record holders such as government departments, companies and organizations have evolved, which enable a citizen legally to change the name recorded on their [[passport]], [[driving licence]], tax and [[National Insurance]] records, bank and credit cards, etc., provided that "documentary evidence" of a change of name is provided. Documents such as [[birth certificate|birth]], [[marriage certificate|marriage]] and educational certificates cannot be changed because these documents are "matters of fact", which means that they were correct at the time they were issued.

Documentary evidence of a change of name can be in a number of forms, such as a marriage certificate, [[decree absolute]], civil partnership certificate, [[statutory declaration]] or [[deed of change of name]]. Such documents are mere evidence that a change of name has occurred, however, and they do not themselves operate to change a person's name. Deeds of change of name are by far the most commonly used method of providing evidence of a change of name other than changing a woman's surname after marriage. A deed poll is a legal document that binds a single person to a particular course of action (in this case, changing one's name for all purposes). The term 'deed' is common to signed, written agreements that have been shown to all concerned parties. Strictly speaking, it is not a contract because it binds only one party and expresses an intention instead of a promise. 'Poll' is an old legal term referring to official documents that had cut edges (were polled) so that they were straight.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/cms/files/deedpolls_notes_0308.doc ''Enrolling a Name Change in the Royal Courts of Justice''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002143613/http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/cms/files/deedpolls_notes_0308.doc |date=2008-10-02 }} (March 2008).

===England and Wales===
People whose births are registered in England and Wales may have their deed poll enrolled at the [[Royal Courts of Justice]] in London.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; See also [[College of Arms#Change of names]].

====Historical usage====
{{See also|Double-barrelled name#British tradition}}
From the mediaeval age to the 19th century, the era of family dynasties, name changes were frequently demanded of heirs in the last wills and testaments, legacies and bequests, of members of the gentry and nobility who were the last males of their bloodline. Such persons frequently selected a younger nephew or cousin as the heir to their estates on condition that he should adopt the surname and armorials of the legator in lieu of his patronymic. Thus the ancient family otherwise destined to extinction would appear to continue as a great dynasty in the making. Such changes were also more rarely demanded by [[marriage settlement]]s, for example where the father of a sole daughter and heiress demanded that as a condition of his daughter's [[dowry]] her husband should adopt his father-in-law's surname and arms. Thus the progeny of the marriage would continue the otherwise extinct family's name. Such name changes were generally only demanded of younger sons, where an elder brother was available to inherit the paternal estates under primogeniture and carry on the name and arms abandoned by the younger brother. Such name changes were effected by obtaining a private [[Act of Parliament]] or by obtaining a Royal Licence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://deedpolloffice.com/research#royal-licences|title=Researching a past change of name – D•P•O|work=Deed Poll Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; A less radical procedure adopted from the 18th century onwards was for the legator or settlor to demand only that the legatee or beneficiary should adopt his surname ''in addition to'' his patronymic, not in place of it, which gave rise to the "[[Double-barrelled name|double-barrelled]]", even the "triple-barrelled" name, frequently parodied in literature as epitomising the wealthy "[[squirearchy]]" with an embarrassment of inherited estates.

Well known examples are:
*Russell to Gorges (14th century). Ralph IV Gorges, 2nd Baron Gorges, died without issue in 1331. In an effort to preserve his family name and arms he made one of his younger nephews his heir, on condition that he should adopt the name and arms of Gorges. This nephew was William Russell, the second son of his second sister Eleanor de Gorges who had married Sir Theobald Russell (d.1341) of [[Kingston Russell]], Dorset. The event is referred to in one of the earliest heraldic law cases brought concerning English armory, [[Warbelton v. Gorges]] in 1347.
*Smithson to Percy (18th century). [[Hugh Percy, 1st Duke of Northumberland|Sir Hugh Smithson, 4th Baronet]] (1715–1786) (c.1714–1786) in 1740 married [[Elizabeth Percy, Duchess of Northumberland|Lady Elizabeth Seymour]], daughter and sole heiress of [[Algernon Seymour, 7th Duke of Somerset]], and granddaughter of Lady Elizabeth Percy (d.1722), daughter and sole heiress of [[Josceline Percy, 11th Earl of Northumberland]] (1644–1670). In 1740, by a private Act of Parliament,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://deedpolloffice.com/research/private-acts-parliament/1749-23-Geo-2-14|title=Hugh Earl of Northumberland's name and arms. – D•P•O|work=Deed Poll Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smithson changed his surname to Percy and inherited the title [[Earl of Northumberland]] and was later created [[Duke of Northumberland]].

===Scotland===
People whose births are [[civil registration|registered]] in Scotland (or who were adopted in Scotland) can change their name in the same way as people from the rest of the United Kingdom.  However they can optionally apply to the [[Registrar General for Scotland]] to have their birth certificate amended to show the new name and have the respective register updated.

==Other common law countries==

=== Australia ===
Individuals may legally change their name through the [[States and territories of Australia|state and territory]] governments of Australia according to state or territory laws and regulations via agencies generally titled "Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australia.gov.au/information-and-services/family-and-community/births-deaths-and-marriages-registries|title=Births, deaths and marriages registries – australia.gov.au|first=Digital Transformation|last=Agency|website=www.australia.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Exceptions exist for some states such as restricted persons (e.g. jail inmate)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bdm.nsw.gov.au/Pages/change-of-name/change-of-name.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; and in some states, changes may only be made once a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.qld.gov.au/law/births-deaths-marriages-and-divorces/changing-your-name/changing-your-name/|title=Changing your name – Your rights, crime and the law|first=; c=AU; o=The State of Queensland; ou=Communication Services|last=Branch|website=www.qld.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Institutions such as banks,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.austrac.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/cip_form_ind_mar08.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the Passports Office&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.passports.gov.au/passportsexplained/theapplicationprocess/eligibilityoverview/Pages/confirmingidentity.aspx|title=Documents that confirm your Australian citizenship and identity|first=Australian Passports|last=Office|website=www.passports.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; and transport authorities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transport.wa.gov.au/licensing/change-my-name.asp|title=Change my name|first=|last=nw|website=www.transport.wa.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; require proof of identity, so people who change their names need to have proof of the change.

If a person's birth or adoption was registered in Australia, the change will also be noted (in most cases) on the person's birth or adoption registration, and in some states or territories, the name change can be evidenced either through a re-issued [[Birth certificate#Australia|birth certificate]] if born in Australia and/or "Change of Name Certificate".  These certificates are recognised secure [[Identity documents of Australia|identity documents]] and can be verified electronically through the [[Attorney-general of Australia]]'s Document Verification Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ag.gov.au/RightsAndProtections/IdentitySecurity/Pages/DocumentVerificationService.aspx|title=Document Verification Service|first=Attorney-General's|last=Department|website=www.ag.gov.au|access-date=2017-04-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170321081501/https://www.ag.gov.au/RightsAndProtections/IdentitySecurity/Pages/DocumentVerificationService.aspx|archive-date=2017-03-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In Canada a person can informally call themselves whatever they want. In all provinces except [[Quebec]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.justice.gouv.qc.ca/english/publications/generale/maria-a.htm#names {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123172016/http://www.justice.gouv.qc.ca/english/publications/generale/maria-a.htm |date=2010-11-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; when someone gets married they can change their last name without legally changing their name by using their [[Marriage Certificate]] as verification of the name change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.programs.alberta.ca/Living/5962.aspx?Ns=364+6228&amp;N=770|title=Government of Alberta – Programs and Services – Getting Married|author=Government of Alberta|work=alberta.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is almost impossible for married women in Québec to take their husbands' names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=72ddc06b-4660-4b92-8b92-3a26ae24b377&amp;k=5969|title=Quebec newlywed furious she can't take her husband's name|work=Canada.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102072805/http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=72ddc06b-4660-4b92-8b92-3a26ae24b377&amp;k=5969|archivedate=2016-01-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Like the United States, the requirements for a formal name change varies from province to province. Except for [[Ontario]], [[British Columbia]] and [[New Brunswick]], [[Canadians]] must be 18 to change their names and have lived in the province they are changing it in for at least 3 months to a year, depending on province. (In [[British Columbia]], Canadians must be 19 to change their names, in [[Ontario]] and [[New Brunswick]] 16.) People younger than the province's [[age of majority]] can change their names if they have their guardians' consent, are legally married, or have a [[common law marriage]].&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/name-change/how-to.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220124142/http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/name-change/how-to.html|date=February 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; To change a name, a Name Change application must be submitted to either the Ministry of Government Services, Court of justice or Registrar of civil status. A document such as a birth certificate must be submitted. A statement as to why the name is being changed is needed in most areas and the reason has to be serious. In Canada, a name cannot cause confusion, be used for misrepresentation or fraud and in most cases the name change is announced in newspapers.

===Hong Kong===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2010}}
It is a common practice for ethnic Chinese residents of Hong Kong to adopt a western-style English name in addition to their transliterated Chinese name. As they often adopt western-style English names after being registered on the birth register, the fact that they want to include a western-style English name as part of their [[Legal name|legal English name]] is regarded as a name change which usually requires a deed poll.

However, the [[Immigration Department (Hong Kong)|Immigration Department]] which is responsible for processing applications for name change allows applicants to submit such applications without deeds poll; anyone who has a phonetic English name only and wishes to include a western-style English name as part of his or her legal English name can apply to the Immigration Department without a deed poll. Only one application of this kind is allowed for each applicant; any application for subsequent change(s) must be made with a deed poll.

===Ireland===
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], a person earns their name by "use and repute". For most purposes it is enough to simply use the desired name and ask others to call you by that name. For some administrative purposes, such as changing a name on a driving licence or [[Legal aspects of transgenderism#Republic of Ireland|legally changing gender]], a [[deed of change of name]] must be registered with the [[Four Courts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth_family_relationships/problems_in_marriages_and_other_relationships/changing_your_name_by_deed_poll.html|title=Changing your name by deed poll|website=www.citizensinformation.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth_family_relationships/changing_to_your_preferred_gender.html|title=Changing to your preferred gender|website=www.citizensinformation.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
From September 1995, [[New Zealanders]] can change their name by making a [[statutory declaration]] and, if approved, the new name is registered with the Births, Deaths and Marriages section of the Department of Internal Affairs (Identity Services). Prior to September 1995, they changed their name by [[deed poll]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dia.govt.nz/diawebsite.nsf/Files/EOIStandard/$file/EOIStandard.pdf Evidence of Identity Standard] NZ Department of Internal Affairs, June 2006, Version 1.0, {{ISBN|0-478-24462-2}}, page 123&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil law==
In general, unlike in [[common law]] countries, names cannot be changed at will in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions. Usually, a name change requires government approval and is only rarely granted, though legal name changes have become more common in some jurisdictions over the last years. The reason given for this system is usually the public interest in the unique identifiability of a person, e.g., in governmental registers, although with the advent of [[personal identification numbers]], that rationale may be in need of reconsideration.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

===Belgium===
In Belgian law, a name is in principle considered fixed for life, but under exceptional circumstances, a person may apply to the Ministry of Justice for a name change. This requires a Royal Decree (French: ''Arrêté royal'', Dutch: ''Koninklijk besluit'') for last names, but only a Ministerial Decree for first names. The new name must not cause confusion or cause damage to the bearer or others. Examples of requests that are usually considered favorably:
* A person of non-European origin who wants to adopt a less exotic name to further his/her integration in Belgian society
* A person stuck with a ridiculous last name that is causing him/her great embarrassment or emotional distress. Actual examples: Salami, Naaktgeboren ("born naked"), and Clooten ("sods of earth" in Middle Dutch, but "testicles" in modern Dutch)
* (for minor children) following legal adoption or recognition of paternity&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.just.fgov.be/nl_htm/informatie/htm_justitie_atotz/naamveranderen.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070514153237/http://www.just.fgov.be/nl_htm/informatie/htm_justitie_atotz/naamveranderen.html|date=May 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
According to the Brazilian Civil Code and the Public Registries Act, the name registered after birth is definitive and immutable. However, there are some circumstances under which a name change is allowed: 
* If an obvious writing error is made while registering the name of the child.  
* In the first year after a person reaches the [[age of majority]] (18&amp;nbsp;years), they can request a change in their first names, but modification of surnames is not allowed.  
* If a person's name exposes them to ridicule and harms their everyday well-being.  
* If a person is recognized publicly by another name, they can request a name change or addition, by providing as support three testimonials of the change in name.  
* If a person has undergone a sex change, recent jurisprudence has allowed name modifications in most such cases.

===India===
In India, the person concerned submits a name change request to an appropriate authority, with supporting documents. Subsequently, an application must be made to the Government Printing Press, which issues an Official Gazette Notification certifying the change of name.&lt;ref&gt;http://goaprintingpress.gov.in/uploads/Change%20of%20Name%20and%20Surname%20Act.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norway===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}
Although it has always been relatively easy to change one's legal names in Norway, it used to require some kind of government approval. As late as 1830, local vicars were instructed to write both given (Christian) names, as well as last names, in the baptismal record. Earlier, only the given name of the child, birth date, baptismal date, and sex were written down, alongside the parents' names. It was not until the beginning of the 20th century, however, that the authorities required everyone to adopt a family surname. Until about 1980, the government still required that a name change applicant apply to the government regional representative (fylkesmann). The law has been replaced twice since then. Nowadays, the process is as easy as in common-law countries; the subject merely submits the names wanted (providing that the surname chosen is not in use or is not used by fewer than 200 persons) to the local authorities for the purposes of election rosters and census counts; there is no longer an application process.

===Philippines===
2001 RA 9048 amends Articles 376 and 412 of the [[Civil Code of the Philippines]], which prohibit the change of name or surname of a person, or any correction or change of entry in a civil register without a judicial order. Administrative Order No. 1 Series of 2001, implemented the law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov.ph/data/civilreg/irr_ra9048.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621060551/http://www.census.gov.ph/data/civilreg/irr_ra9048.html|date=June 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It authorizes the city or municipal civil registrar or the consul general to correct a clerical or typographical error in an entry or change the first name or nickname in the civil register without need of a judicial order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov.ph/data/civilreg/primerra9048.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212183553/http://www.census.gov.ph/data/civilreg/primerra9048.html|archivedate=February 12, 2012|website=census.gov.ph|title= Civil Registration – Primer for RA 9048}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/republicactno9048.htm|title=PHILIPPINE LAWS, STATUTES AND CODES – CHAN ROBLES VIRTUAL LAW LIBRARY|work=chanrobles.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Name and gender change====
In case of controversial and substantial changes, [[Philippines]] [[jurisprudence]] requires full-blown court [[lawsuit]], that must include the local civil registrar in the petition, since RA 9048 and Rule 108 (Cancellation or correction of entries in the Civil Registry) of the Rules of Court do not allow the change of sex in a birth certificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/rulesofcourtspecialproceedings.htm#RULE%20108|title=SPECIAL PROCEEDINGS|work=chanrobles.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only landmark case in the Philippines on name and legal sex change is the Jeff Cagandahan case. The [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] Justice [[Leonardo Quisumbing]] on September 12, 2008, allowed Cagandahan, 27, who has [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]], to change his [[birth certificate]] name from Jennifer to Jeff, and his legal gender from female to male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20080917-161148/Call-him-Jeff-says-SC-he-used-to-be-called-Jennifer|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808193038/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20080917-161148/Call-him-Jeff-says-SC-he-used-to-be-called-Jennifer|archivedate=August 8, 2014|title=Call him Jeff, says SC; he used to be called Jennifer|work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,24359150-401,00.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216041937/http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,24359150-401,00.html|archivedate=February 16, 2009|title=Woman's body 'naturally' became male|work=[[News.com.au]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,423242,00.html|title=Rare Condition Turns Woman Into Man|work=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quebec===
Although as in other jurisdictions residents of [[Quebec]] may informally use whatever name they want, procedures for formal name change are very strict as Quebec (unlike the rest of Canada) operates under a [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system. The decision must be authorized by the Director of Civil Status, and requires a valid reason for changing the name, including long-term use of the new name (in the Montreuil case cited below, the Quebec appeals court has considered five years' use to be a sufficient reason), difficulty of use due to spelling or pronunciation, or bearing a name that another person has made infamous.

Only a judge may authorize a name change for a child for reasons of abandonment, deprivation of parental authority, or change in [[Paternity (law)|filiation]] such as [[adoption]].

This has occasionally led to controversy. A lawyer named Micheline Montreuil, a non-operative [[transgender]] woman, had to undergo a lengthy process to have her name legally changed. Initially, the director of civil status refused to permit the change on the grounds that a legal male could not bear a female name. According to Quebec law, Montreuil could not change her record of sex because this requires proof of a completed [[sex reassignment surgery]], which she has not had. On November 1, 1999, the provincial court of appeal ruled that nothing in the law prevented a person who was legally male from legally adopting a woman's name. (Montreuil was initially prevented from changing her name despite this ruling on the grounds that she had not established general use, as normally required for a name change; the Quebec appeals court finally authorized the change on November 7, 2002.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.micheline.ca/page034-batailles-e.htm#dictateur|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212004926/http://www.micheline.ca/page034-batailles-e.htm|archivedate=February 12, 2012|title=Micheline Anne Hélène Montreuil and his fights|website=micheline.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Director of Civil Status will amend a Quebec birth certificate if a name change certificate is issued by another province. Some have used that loophole by temporarily moving to one of Canada's other provinces, which follow the more permissive common-law rules, in order to get the legal documents.

===South Africa===
South Africa, which uses a mixture of common law and civil [[Roman Dutch law]], mostly uses common-law procedures with regard to name change. Name changes in [[South Africa]] are regulated by the Births and Deaths Registration Act (Act 51 of 1992, as amended). The personal information of all citizens and permanent residents is recorded on the Population Register, so any name changes must be registered.

A person can change their forenames by submitting a form to the [[South African Department of Home Affairs|Department of Home Affairs]]. An individual's surname, or that of a family, may be changed by applying to the Department and providing a "good and sufficient reason" for the change.

A married woman can change her surname to that of her husband or join her maiden name with her husband's surname, and a divorced woman may return to her previous surname, without applying or paying a fee; but she must notify the department so that the details in the Population Register can be changed. (It is possible that, if challenged, these provisions might be held to be unconstitutional because they apply only to women.)

South Africa has officially recognized same sex marriages since 2006 and in doing so now allows one or both partners to change their surnames in the marriage register on the day of the marriage. A new passport and ID book can then be applied for with the new married surname as well.

The surnames of minor children can also be changed under various circumstances involving the marriage, divorce or death of a parent, children born out of wedlock, and guardianship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.home-affairs.gov.za/personal_amendments.asp ''Personal Amendments.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911222143/http://www.home-affairs.gov.za/personal_amendments.asp |date=2008-09-11 }} (c. 1997). South African Department of Home Affairs. Retrieved May 19, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland===
In Switzerland, a name change requires the approval of the respective [[Cantons of Switzerland|Cantonal]] government, if there are important reasons (''wichtige Gründe'' / ''justes motifs'') for the change, according to article 30 of the [[Swiss Civil Code]]. When aliens apply for naturalization, they have the option of asking for their names to be changed upon the grants of citizenship with no additional fees.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} According to the case law of the [[Swiss Federal Supreme Court]], such requests must be granted only if the petitioner shows that they suffer substantially from their present name, e.g., if it is the same as that of a notorious criminal.

===Taiwan===
{{Wikibooks|Annotated Republic of China Laws/Name Act}}
In [[Taiwan]], the government strictly regulates when one's surname, given name or both may or may not be changed, under the Name Act (姓名條例) since 1953 with 10 articles, totally amended into 14 articles in 2001, and the [[s:Enforcement Regulations of the Name Act|Enforcement Regulations of the Name Act]] (姓名條例施行細則).

Legally permitted reasons to change one's given name are:&lt;ref&gt;Article 6 of the Name Act (1953) ([[s:zh:姓名條例 (民國42年)|姓名條例 (民國42年)]]), amended into Article 7 of the Name Act (2001) ([[s:zh:姓名條例 (民國90年)|姓名條例 (民國90年)]]).&lt;/ref&gt;
#Having the same name when serving in an institution or studying in the same school.
#Since 1983, having the same name as one's parent, grandparent, or great-grandparent.&lt;ref&gt;Clause 2 of Article 6 of the Name Act (1983) ([[s:zh:姓名條例 (民國72年)|姓名條例 (民國72年)]]), amended into Clause 2 of Section 1 of Article 7 of the Name Act (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;
#Having the same name as someone else who lives in the same county or city and having lived there for at least 6 months.
#Having the same name as a wanted criminal, for example [[:zh:陳進興|陳進興 (Chén Jìnxīng)]], a common name used by not only a convicted kidnapper and murderer who was executed in Taiwan for major crimes in 1997 ([[:zh:陳進興 (台灣罪犯)]]) but also a Taiwanese statesman ([[:zh:陳進興 (台灣政治人物)]]).
#Having special reasons,&lt;ref&gt;Clause 6 of Section 1 of Article 7 of the Name Act (2001) effective 15 October 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; which is limited to twice in one's lifetime, while the second given name change of this type may not be done before reaching adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;Section 2 of Article 7 of the Name Act (2001) effective 15 October 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name change on religious conversion==
{{further|Religious name}}
Adherents of various religions change their name upon [[Religious conversion|conversion]] or confirmation. The name adopted may not have any legal status but will represent their adopted religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Celia Emmelhainz, [http://works.bepress.com/emmelhainz/4/ ''Naming a New Self: Identity Elasticity and Self-Definition in Voluntary Name Changes.''] (c. 2012). Names, Vol. 60, Iss. 3. Retrieved April 4, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
* Individuals who attend a ceremony to officially become Buddhists are usually given a new "[[Dharma name]]", which marks their "[[Refuge (Buddhism)|taking refuge]]".

===Christianity===
* It has been historical Christian practice to adopt a name on [[baptism]] or (in some countries) [[confirmation (sacrament)|confirmation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/ce001006.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050428082432/http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/ce001006.htm|date=April 28, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The customary practice whereby persons entering a [[religious institute]] take on a [[name in religion]] is still observed by [[Eastern Orthodox]] and some traditional [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]]. Eastern Orthodox monastics are usually given the name of a prophet or a monastic saint.
* [[Pope]]s take a [[papal name]] upon their accession to office; for example, [[Jorge M. Bergoglio]] adopted the name [[Francis (given name)|Francis]].

===Hinduism===
There is no formal concept of conversion in Hinduism but converts to Hinduism are accepted, usually after a small ceremony called [[Shuddhi|Shudhikaran]] (purification). Individuals who attend a Shudhikaran ceremony to officially become [[Hindu]] may be optionally given a new [[Dharma]] (religious) name, which is usually based on [[Sanskrit]] or [[Indian name]] such as names based on [[Hindu deities]].

===Islam===
* Converts to Islamic faith may choose a new name; although it is not required, it may in some cases be preferable for personal reasons or because the name is of uncertain Islamicity (e.g. the person converting has a [[theophoric name]] in another religion, such as Christopher or Ganesh). Boxer Cassius Clay's adoption of the name [[Muhammad Ali]] is a well-known example, as is Cat Stevens' change to [[Yusuf Islam]] and Malcolm Little's adoption of the name [[Malcolm X]] and later ''El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz''.  On the other hand, converts may choose to keep their names, as did [[Dave Chappelle]].
*Women do not normally take their husbands' surnames as their own. Their maiden name continues to be their surname even after marriage. Sometimes their husbands first name becomes their surname, similar to the case of surname chains indicating someone's chain of fathers. 
* In Islamic tradition, there are two kinds of [[surname]].
:# The first kind comes from the father's first name, which means that the particular person is the child of. For example, a name such as ''ibn Abdullah'' means "son of Abdullah", or ''bint Abdullah'' means "daughter of Abdullah". Father descendant names can be chained, meaning that an individual can have the name of their father, followed by their paternal grandfather, followed by the father of that grandfather, to indicate a patrilineal lineage.
:# The second kind is associated with [[clan]], [[tribal]] or [[ethnic]] affiliation and is also solely dependant on the person's patrilineal line. In Islamic family law, the individual is required to keep the clan, tribal or ethnic affiliation of their father where it is known, whether the child be illegitimate, staying with their mother after divorce or adopted.
The last name cannot be changed in such a way as to reflect a heritage that is not that of one's biological father.

===Judaism===
* Jewish people in the Diaspora sometimes give their children two names: a secular name for everyday use and a Hebrew name for religious purposes.  [[Conversion to Judaism|Converts to Judaism]] choose a Hebrew name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://judaism.about.com/library/3_lifecycles/names/bl_names.htm|title=Choosing a Hebrew Name – Naming a Jewish Baby|author=Ariela Pelaia|work=About.com Religion &amp; Spirituality}}&lt;/ref&gt; Full Jewish names include a [[patronym]]: converts take the patronym "ben/bat Avraham Avinu" (son/daughter of Our Father Abraham) as converts are held to be spiritual descendants of [[Abraham]], the forebear of Jews.

===Sikhism===
* Those in the [[Sikh]] faith adopt a new last name upon baptism into the [[Khalsa]]. Men adopt the last name [[Singh]], while women adopt the last name [[Kaur]].
* The Sikhs adopted the name Singh in 1699 during the Birth of the Khalsa.

===Wicca===
* Some wiccans have a [[Craft name]] that is used during coven gatherings and rituals.

From left to right are the three Christians: Charlemagne bearing an eagle upon his shield, King Arthur displaying three crowns, and Godfrey of Bouillon with a dog lying before him; then the three pagans: Julius Caesar, Hector, and Alexander the Great bearing a griffon upon his shield; and lastly the three Jews: David holding a sceptre, Joshua, and Judas Maccabeus.]]

The '''Nine Worthies''' are nine historical, scriptural, and legendary personages who personify the ideals of [[chivalry]] established in [[the Middle Ages]], whose lives were deemed a valuable study for aspirants to chivalric status. All were commonly referred to as '[[Prince]]s', regardless of their historical titles. In French they are called ''Les Neuf Preux'' or "Nine Valiants",&lt;ref&gt;''Larousse Dictionnaire de la Langue Francaise'' Lexis, 1993: ''Brave, Vaillant''&lt;/ref&gt; giving a more specific idea of the moral virtues they exemplified: those of soldierly courage and generalship.  In Italy they are ''i Nove Prodi''.

The Nine Worthies include three pagans ([[Hector]], [[Alexander the Great]], and [[Julius Caesar]]), three Jews ([[Joshua]], [[David]], and [[Judas Maccabeus]]) and three Christians ([[King Arthur]], [[Charlemagne]], and [[Godfrey of Bouillon]]).

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Alexander—Attributed coat of arms of Gaius Julius Caesar—2011.png|thumb|right|The Nine Worthies were each attributed a coat of arms during the European mediaeval period. Julius Caesar was attributed a black two-headed eagle on a gold shield.]] --&gt;

They were first described in the early fourteenth century, by [[Jacques de Longuyon]] in his ''Voeux du Paon'' (1312).&lt;ref&gt;[[Johan Huizinga]], ''[[The Autumn of the Middle Ages|The Waning of the Middle Ages]]'', (1919) 1924:61.&lt;/ref&gt; Their selection, as [[Johan Huizinga]] pointed out, betrays a close connection with the [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance genre of chivalry]]. Neatly divided into a triad of triads, these men were considered to be paragons of chivalry within their particular traditions, whether [[Paganism|Pagan]], [[Judaism|Jewish]], or [[Christianity|Christian]]. Longuyon's choices soon became a common theme in the literature and art of the Middle Ages and earned a permanent place in the popular consciousness. The medieval "craving for symmetry"&lt;ref&gt;Huizinga 1924:61.&lt;/ref&gt; engendered female equivalents, the ''neuf preuses'', who were sometimes added, though the women chosen varied. [[Eustache Deschamps]] selected "a group of rather bizarre heroines"&lt;ref&gt;Huizinga 1924:61.&lt;/ref&gt; selected from fiction and history, among them [[Penthesilea]], [[Tomyris]], [[Semiramis]]. Literature and suites of [[tapestry]] featured the full complement of eighteen, whose allegorical figures preceded [[Henry VI of England|King Henry VI of England]] in his triumphal [[royal entry]] to Paris, 1431.&lt;ref&gt;Huizinga 1924:61.&lt;/ref&gt; A "tenth worthy"&lt;ref&gt;Compare the concept of the "[[Muse#The "tenth Muse"|Tenth Muse]]".&lt;/ref&gt; was added by Deschamps, in the figure of [[Bertrand du Guesclin]], the Breton knight to whom France owed recovery from the battles of [[Battle of Crécy|Crécy (1346)]] and [[Battle of Poitiers (1356)|Poitiers (1356)]]. [[Francis I of France]] still occasionally paraded himself at court dressed in the "antique mode" to identify himself also as one of the ''Neuf Preux''.&lt;ref&gt;Huizinga 1924:61.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1459 [[Ingeram Codex]] presents the coat of arms of the Nine Worthies among a larger list of [[attributed arms]] of exemplary individuals, as the three "better Jews", "best pagans" and "best Christians"&lt;!--sic, pp. 28-30 File:Ingeram Codex 028.jpg --&gt; alongside the arms attributed to three heroes of [[King David]] (glossed as "the first coats of arms"), the [[Three Magi]],  the "three mildest princes", the "three worst tyrants" ([[Nebuchadnezzar]], [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes|Antiochos Epiphanes]] and [[Nero]]),  "three patient ones" ([[Alfonso X of Castile|Alphonse the Wise]], [[Job (biblical figure)|Job]] and [[Saint Eustachius]]), "three anointed kings"  (France, Denmark and Hungary) and "three noble dynasties" ([[Louis XI of France]], called "Louis the Prudent" as [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]], [[Ladislaus I of Hungary]], and [[Otto III, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg]] of the [[House of Welf]]).

==Symbolism==
As a group, the nine worthies represent all facets of the perfect chivalrous warrior. All, with the exception of Hector, are conquering heroes. (Despite Arthur's later downfall, historical and literary texts record his early conquests in Britain and on the Continent). Those not royal were presumed to come from knightly families. All lived in the pre-[[Heraldry|heraldic]] era, and [[attributed arms]] were invented for them, as in [[Lucas van Leyden]]'s engraving. All brought glory and honor to their nations and were noted for their personal prowess in arms. As individuals, each displayed some outstanding quality of chivalry which made them exemplars of knighthood. That the nine individual figures were generally not distinguished, iconographically, with respect to relative antiquity or ethnicity, would suggest that the virtues that they manifest are to be understood as timeless and universal.

==Classification==
The Nine Worthies comprise a triad of triads as follows:

===Pagans===
*[[Hector]]
*[[Alexander the Great]]
*[[Julius Caesar]]

===Jews===
*[[Joshua]]
*[[David]]
*[[Judas Maccabeus]]

===Christians===
*[[King Arthur]]
*[[Charlemagne]]
*[[Godfrey of Bouillon]]

==Cultural references==

===Literature===
The Nine Worthies were also a popular subject for [[masque]]s in [[Renaissance]] Europe. In [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]'' the comic characters attempt to stage such a masque, but it descends into chaos. The list of Worthies actually named in the play include two not on the original list, [[Hercules]] and [[Pompey the Great]]. Alexander, Judas Maccabaeus, and Hector also appear on stage before the show collapses into complete disorder. The worthies are also mentioned in ''[[Henry IV, Part 2]]'' in which [[Doll Tearsheet]] is so impressed by [[Falstaff]]'s bravery in fighting [[Ancient Pistol]] that she says he is "as valorous as Hector of Troy, worth five of Agamemnon, and ten times better than the Nine Worthies".&lt;ref&gt;Shakespeare, William, ''Henry IV, Part 2'', Act 2, Scene 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Don Quixote]] evokes the Nine Worthies in Volume I, Chapter 5, telling a peasant (who is trying to get him to admit who he is) "I know that I may be not only those I have named, but all the Twelve Peers of France and even all the Nine Worthies, since my achievements surpass all that they have done all together and each of them on his own account".&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Don Quixote/Volume 1/Chapter V|Chapter V - In which the narrative of our knight's mishap is continued]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art===
The Nine Worthies had not devolved to folk culture even in the seventeenth century, for a frieze of the Nine Worthies, contemporary with Shakespeare's comedy, was painted at the outset of the seventeenth century at [[North Mymms|North Mymms Place, Hertfordshire]], an up-to-date house built by the Coningsby family, 1599.&lt;ref&gt;[http://brookmans.com/history/house/ch3.shtml North Mymms Park - A short history - Chapter 3 - Wall Paintings&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Cloisters]], in New York City, has important portions of an early 15th-century tapestry series illustrating the surviving five of the Nine Worthies: King Arthur, Joshua, David, Hector, and Julius Caesar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/the_cloisters/Tapestry_Fragment_from_the_Series_Five_Worthies_and/ViewObject.aspx?depNm=the_cloisters&amp;Title=Tapestry_Fragment_from_the_Series_Five_Worthies_and_&amp;pID=0&amp;kWd=hector&amp;OID=70008204&amp;vW=0&amp;Pg=1&amp;St=5&amp;StOd=1&amp;vT=2 King Arthur: Tapestry Fragment from the Series, Five Worthies and Attendant Figures (with 32.130.3a, b) | All | The Cloisters | Collection Database | Works of Art | The Metrop...&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

''I Nove Prodi'', a fresco by the ''Maestro del Castello della Manta'', an [[anonymous master]], painted c. 1420 in the ''sala baronale'' of the [[Castello della Manta]], Saluzzo, Italy. The series also includes depictions of their female counterparts.

[[Montacute House]] has sculptures of the Nine Worthies spaced along the upper eastern façade on the exterior of the long gallery [[Pier (architecture)|piers]]. These figures are dressed in Roman armour.

==Nine Worthy Women==
In the late fourteenth century, Lady Worthies began to accompany the Nine Worthies, though usually not individualized and shown as anonymous [[Amazons|Amazon-styled warriors]]. In later years, nine of the "Most Illustrious Ladies of All Ages and Nations" were chosen from scripture, history and legend to be placed alongside their male counterparts, though the choices for the Lady Worthies were not usually standardized and often varied by region, author and artist.

[[File:Penthesilea as one of the Nine Female Worthie.jpg|thumb|left|[[Penthesilea]] as one of the Lady Worthies]]

[[Eustache Deschamps]] to the ''neuf preux'' adds ''neuf preuses'' (women), including [[Penthesilea]], [[Tomyris]], and [[Semiramis]]. Together with their male counterparts, they precede [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] as he enters Paris in 1431, and figure in ''[[Le Jouvencel]]''  (1466). The list of ''preuses'' was however less fixed, and not always structured in pagan, Jewish and Christian triads. [[Thomas III of Saluzzo]]&lt;ref&gt;''le chevalier errant'', Bibliothèque nationale, Paris, mss. Fr. 12559, fol. 125v; manuscript dated to 1403-04&lt;/ref&gt; has: ''[[Deipyle|Deiphille]], [[Sinope (mythology)|Synoppe]],  [[Hippolyte]], [[Melanippe|Menalyppe]], [[Semiramis]], [[Lampetho]], [[Tomyris|Thamarys]], [[Teuta]], [[Penthesilea|Penthésilée]]''.

A very fine set of [[Siena|Siennese]] fifteenth century panel paintings, attributed to the [[Master of the Griselda Legend]] and others, now incomplete and widely dispersed, showed male and female worthies - the remaining paintings were reunited in a 2007 exhibition at the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]], London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museopoldipezzoli.it/node/461 Artemesia in Milan], [http://www.nga.gov/fcgi-bin/tinfo_f?object=41612 David in NGA Washington] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925142600/http://www.nga.gov/fcgi-bin/tinfo_f?object=41612 |date=2008-09-25 }}, [http://www.aworldtowin.net/images/images255/RenaissanceW056.pr.jpg Alexander in Birmingham]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[German Renaissance]], [[Hans Burgkmair]] made a set of six [[woodcut]]s, each showing three of the "Eighteen Worthies". In addition to the usual males, his prints showed the Pagan [[Lucretia]], [[Veturia]] and [[Verginia|Virginia]], the Jewish [[Esther]], [[Judith]] and [[Yael]], and the Christian Saints [[Helena of Constantinople|Helena]], [[Bridget of Sweden]] and [[Elizabeth of Hungary]]. Burgkmair was in touch with [[Augsburg]] [[Renaissance Humanist]] circles, who may have helped choose the group. Apart from Veturia, mother of [[Gnaeus Marcius Coriolanus|Coriolanus]], who tried to save Rome from defeat by her son, the other pagan two were examples of chastity, responsible for no heroic acts except their defence of their own virtue. In contrast, two of the Jewish women, Judith and Jael, are known for their personal assassination of leaders opposed to Israel. Judith carries a sword in one hand and [[Holofernes]]'s severed head in the other, and Jael carries the mallet with which she hammered a peg in the head of [[Sisera]]. The "[[Power of Women]]" and female violence was an interest of German artists at the time, and [[Lucas van Leyden]], [[Albrecht Altdorfer]] and others made prints of Jael in the act.&lt;ref&gt;H Diane Russell (ed), ''Eva/Ave; Women in Renaissance and Baroque Prints'', pp. 36-39, National Gallery of Art, Washington, 1990, {{ISBN|1-558-61039-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Christian trio of saints, all very popular in Germany at the time, are all women who had been married - Bridget became an [[abbess]] as a widow. In addition, like three of the male worthies, Elizabeth of Hungary was an ancestor of Burgkmair's patron [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]], and Helena was a Roman Empress. Unlike the other two groups, who all face each other, apparently in conversation, these three all look down, and may illustrate the female virtue of silence.&lt;ref&gt;(covers all Burgmair section)H Diane Russell;''Eva/Ave; Women in Renaissance and Baroque Prints''; Nos. 1, &amp; for Jael: 91, 92 National Gallery of Art, Washington, 1990; {{ISBN|1-55861-039-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Burgkmair's conception was not very widely followed.

==''Nine Worthies of London''==
{{further|Nine Worthies of London}}

''Nine Worthies of London'' is a book by Richard Johnson, written in 1592, that borrows the theme from the Nine Worthies. The book is subtitled ''Explaining the Honourable Excise of Armes, the Vertues of the Valiant, and the Memorable Attempts of Magnanimous Minds; Pleasaunt for Gentlemen, not unseemely for Magistrates, and most profitable for Prentises'', celebrated the rise of nine famous Londoners through society from the ranks of apprentices or commoners.

The nine were Sir [[William Walworth]], Sir [[Henry Picard (Lord Mayor of London)|Henry Pritchard]], Sir [[Thomas White (merchant)|Thomas White]], Sir [[William Sevenoke]], Sir [[John Hawkwood]], Sir John Bonham, Christopher Croker, Sir Henry Maleverer of Cornhill, and Sir Hugh Calverley.

The term "Nine Worthies" was later used to refer to nine of the privy councillors of [[William III of England|William III]]: [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Devonshire|Devonshire]], [[Charles Sackville, 6th Earl of Dorset|Dorset]], [[Charles Mordaunt, 3rd Earl of Peterborough|Monmouth]], [[Edward Russell, 1st Earl of Orford|Edward Russell]], [[Peregrine Osborne, 2nd Duke of Leeds|Carmarthen]], [[Thomas Herbert, 8th Earl of Pembroke|Pembroke]], [[Daniel Finch, 2nd Earl of Nottingham|Nottingham]], [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Marlborough]], and [[John Lowther, 1st Viscount Lonsdale|Lowther]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4226">A '''patrial name''' or '''geographical surname''' is a surname or second [[cognomen]] given to person deriving from a [[toponym]], the name for a geographical place. It was particularly common in ancient Greece and Rome.&lt;ref&gt;The New Century classical handbook Catherine B. Avery - 1962 "Toponyms (place names) also appear: Coriolanus, Norbanus, Sabinus, Soranus, Tusculanus.&lt;/ref&gt;
The lack of a family [[surname]] and use of a geographical cognomen as a surname may the sign of a lower class, such as courtesans when signing a contract.&lt;ref&gt;Molière: A Theatrical Life - Page 42 Virginia Scott - 2002 "Taviani identifies Lucrezia as a courtesan because of her name that, in the fashion of courtesans, joins a Roman first name to a geographical surname and because the contract was signed in a house owned or leased by her at a time when  "&lt;/ref&gt; With medieval writers, Christian, Jewish and Muslim, whose works circulated around many countries, geographical cognomens sometimes served to distinguish better than "son of," "ben" or "ibn." 

Roman Military commanders often took a second cognomen, an [[agnomen]], recalling a victorious campaign: Africanus, Asiaticus, Macedonicus, Numantinus. These may be inherited as in the case of [[Augustus]] who inherited the cognomen Thurinus.

==Formation==
Examples in formation of patrial names include:

1. definite article and noun - using a [[demonym]] (also called [[gentile name]] or [[gentilic]], from Latin ''[[nomen gentile]]'' or ''[[gentilicium]]'')
* [[Athenagoras of Athens|Athenagoras the Athenian]] (''Athenagoras o Athenaios,'' Ἀθηναγόρας ὁ Ἀθηναῖος).
* [[Saul of Tarsus]] "Saul the Tarsian" (''Saulos o Tarseus'', Σαῦλος [ὁ] Ταρσεύς)
* [[Lucius of Cyrene|Lucius the Cyrenian]] (''Loukios o Kurenaios'' Λούκιος ὁ Κυρηναῖος)
* [[Trophimus]] "called the Ephesian" (''Trofimos o Efesios'', Τρόφιμος ὁ Ἐφέσιος)
* [[Ibn Muʿādh al-Jayyānī|Ibn Muadh al-Jayyani]] (989-1079) "al Jayyani", the man of [[Jaén, Spain|Jaén]]
* [[Isaac Alfasi]] (1013-1103) "al Fasi", the man of [[Fez, Morocco]]

2. unclear: indefinite noun / adjectival forms
* [[Mary Magdalene]], "Mary of [[Magdala]]" (Greek ''Maria Magadelene,'' Μαρία Μαγδαληνή).
 
3. adjectives - a common Latin method for making a [[toponym]]ic adjective is to add -[i]ensis
* [[Giraldus Cambrensis]] "Gerald of [[Wales]]"
* [[Galfridus Monemutensis]], "Geoffrey of [[Monmouth]]"

4. genitive "of" constructions
* [[Jacopo da Bologna]] "Jacob of [[Bologna]]"
* [[Jacques de Vitry]] "James of [[Vitry-sur-Seine]]"

In examples 1 through 3, where the noun or adjective has case [[declension]] the partial name will typically decline in accordance with normal noun or adjective rules. For example, in ''Giraldi Cambrensis opera'' - "the works of [genitive] Gerald of Wales" - ''Giraldus'' declines to ''Giraldi'' (the genitive form of Gerald) and ''cambrensis'' (nominative adjective) declines to ''cambrensis'' (genitive adjective, but the same as nominative in this example). The declension is normally not followed when citing Latin patrial names in English, "of Giraldus Cambrensis," but may cause confusion when trying to identify the nominative spellings of patrial names from Latin or Greek sources.

==Modern era examples==
Modern era examples in Europe are generally limited to nicknames, or deliberate choices of a birthplace as a penname or stagename or change of name by deed poll:
* [[Bela Lugosi]] stagename "from [[Lugoj]]"&lt;ref&gt;Transylvania: Birthplace of Vampires - Page 32 Robert Z. Cohen - 2011  This onscreen Dracula was the creation of Transylvanian-Hungarian actor Bela Lugosi. Born Béla Blaskó in the western Transylvanian city of Lugoj (his stage name means “from Lugoj” in Hungarian&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[George Brassaï]] pseudonym "from [[Braşov]]"&lt;ref&gt;European culture: a contemporary companion Jonathan Law - 1993 "His professional name means 'from Brasso', his birthplace. After studying in Budapest and Berlin he moved to Paris in 1924, where he worked as a journalist; he did not take his first photograph until the age of 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:FML names-2.png|thumb|300px|First/given, middle and last/family/surname with [[John Fitzgerald Kennedy]] as example. This shows a structure typical for English-speaking cultures (and some others). Other cultures use other structures for full names.]]

A '''personal name''' or '''full name''' is the set of names by which an individual is known and that can be recited as a [[word-group]], with the understanding that, taken together, they all relate to that one individual. In many cultures, the term is synonymous with the ''[[birth name]]'' or ''[[legal name]]'' of the individual. The academic study of personal names is called [[anthroponymy]].

In [[Western culture]], nearly all individuals possess at least one ''[[given name]]'' (also known as a ''first name'', ''forename'', or ''Christian name''), together with a ''[[surname]]'' (also known as a ''last name'' or ''family name'')—respectively, the Abraham and Lincoln in [[Abraham Lincoln]]—the latter to indicate that the individual belongs to a family, a tribe, or a clan.  Where there are two or more given names, typically only one (in English-speaking cultures usually the first) is used in normal speech.

Another naming convention that is used mainly in the [[Arab culture|Arabic culture]] and in different other areas across Africa and Asia is connecting the person's given name with a chain of names, starting with the name of the person's father and then the father's father and so on, usually ending with the family name (tribe or clan name). However, the legal full name of a person usually contains the first three names with the family name at the end, to limit the name in government-issued ID. Also note that the wife's name does not change after marriage, and it follows the naming convention described above.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=February 2005|title=The Arabic Naming System|url=http://www.councilscienceeditors.org/wp-content/uploads/v28n1p020-021.pdf|journal=Councilscienceeditors.org|language=en|volume=28| issue = 1|pages=20–21|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cultures, including Western ones, also add (or once added) [[patronymic]]s or [[matronymic]]s. For instance, as a middle name as with [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]] (whose father's given name was Ilya), or as a last name as with [[Björk Guðmundsdóttir]] (whose father was named Guðmundur) or [[Heiðar Helguson]] (whose mother was named Helga). Similar concepts are present in [[Eastern world|Eastern]] cultures.

However, in some areas of the world, many people are known by a single name, and so are said to be [[mononymous person|mononymous]]. Still other cultures lack the concept of specific, fixed names designating people, either individually or collectively. Certain isolated tribes, such as the [[Machiguenga people|Machiguenga]] of the Amazon, do not use personal names.{{efn-lr|The Machiguenga may have nicknames, but generally refer to each other by how they are related. They may disambiguate with biographical information, such as "sister, the one who slipped in the river".&lt;ref&gt;Snell, Wayne W (1964). Kinship relations in Machiguenga. pp. 17–25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Allen W. ''Families of the forest: the Matsigenka Indians of the Peruvian Amazon''. [[University of California Press]], 2003. [https://books.google.com/books?id=_JXC70OnxEgC&amp;pg=PA9 pp. 9–10]. Retrieved from [[Google Books]] on April 1, 2012. {{ISBN|978-0-520-23242-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A person's full name usually identifies that person for legal and administrative purposes, although it may not be the name by which the person is commonly known; some people use only a portion of their full name, or are known by titles, nicknames, [[pseudonym]]s or other formal or informal designations.

It is nearly universal for people to have names; the [[United Nations]] [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] declares that a child has the right to a name from birth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CRC.aspx Text of the Convention on the Rights of the Child], Adopted and opened for signature, ratification and accession by General Assembly resolution 44/25 of 20 November 1989 entry into force 2 September 1990, in accordance with article 49, Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
Common components of names given at birth include:
* Personal name: The [[given name]] (or [[acquired name]] in some cultures)  can precede a [[family name]] (as in some European cultures), or it can come after the family name (as in some East Asian cultures), or be used without a family name.
* [[Patronymic]]: A surname based on the given name of the father.
* [[Matronymic]]: A surname based on the given name of the mother.
* [[Family name]]: A name used by all members of a family. In [[China]], surnames gradually came into common use beginning in the 3rd century BC (having been common only among the nobility before that). In some areas of East Asia (e.g. Vietnam and Korea), surnames developed in the next several centuries, while in other areas (like Japan), surnames did not become prevalent until the 19th century. In [[Europe]], after the loss of the [[Roman naming conventions|Roman system]], the common use of family names started quite early in some areas ([[France]] in the 13th century, and [[Germany]] in the 16th century), but it often did not happen until much later in areas that used a patronymic naming custom, such as the [[Scandinavia]]n countries, [[Wales]], and some areas of [[Germany]], as well as [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]]. The compulsory use of surnames varied greatly. France required a priest to write surnames in baptismal records in 1539 (but did not require surnames for Jews, who usually used [[patronymic]]s, until 1808). On the other hand, surnames were not compulsory in the Scandinavian countries until the 19th or 20th century (1923) in [[Norway]], and [[Iceland]] still [[Icelandic name|does not use surnames]] for its native inhabitants. In [[Spain]], [[Portugal]] and most Latin American countries, two surnames are used, one being the father's family name and the other being the mother's family name. Whereas Spain used to put the father's family name before the mother's family name, Portugal and Brazil keep the inverse order but use the father's family name as the principal one. A Portuguese man named António de Oliveira Guterres would therefore be known commonly as [[António Guterres]]. In Spain, though, the second surname is frequently used if the first one is too common to allow an easy identification. For example, Prime Minister [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]] is often called [[Zapatero]]. In most of the cultures of the Middle East and South Asia, surnames were not generally used until European influence took hold in the 19th century.
* In many families, single or multiple [[middle name]]s are simply alternative names, names honoring an ancestor or relative, or, for married women, sometimes their maiden names. In some traditions, however, the roles of the first and middle given names are reversed, with the first given name being used to honor a family member and the middle name being used as the usual method to address someone informally. Many [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] families choose a [[saint]]'s name as their child's middle name or this can be left until the child's [[Confirmation (sacrament)|confirmation]] when they choose a saint's name for themselves. Cultures that use [[patronymic]]s or [[matronymic]]s will often give middle names to distinguish between two similarly named people: e.g., Einar Karl Stefánsson and Einar Guðmundur Stefánsson. This is especially done in Iceland (as shown in example) where people are known and referred to almost exclusively by their given name/s.

Some people (called ''anonyms'') choose to be [[Anonymity|anonymous]], that is, to hide their true names, for fear of governmental prosecution or social ridicule of their works or actions. Another method to disguise one's identity is to employ a [[pseudonym]].

For some people, their name is a single word, known as a [[mononym]]. This can be true from birth, or occur later in life. For example, [[Teller (entertainer)|Teller]], of the magician duo [[Penn and Teller]], was named Raymond Joseph Teller at birth, but changed his name both legally and socially to be simply "Teller". In some official government documents, such as his [[driver's license]], his given name is listed as ''NFN'', an acronym for "no first name".

The [[Inuit]] believe that the [[Soul (spirit)|souls]] of the [[namesake]]s are one, so they traditionally refer to the junior namesakes, not just by the names (''atiq''), but also by [[kinship]] title, which applies across gender and generation without implications of disrespect or seniority. In [[Judaism]], someone's name is considered intimately connected with his fate, and adding a name (e.g. on the sickbed) may avert a particular danger. Among [[Ashkenazi Jews]] it is also considered bad luck to take the name of a living ancestor, as the [[Death (personification)#In Judaism|Angel of Death]] may mistake the younger person for his namesake (although there is no such custom among [[Sephardi Jews]]). Jews may also have a Jewish name for intra-community use and use a different name when engaging with the [[goyim|Gentile]] world.

Chinese children are called diminutive or pejorative names to make them appear worthless to evil spirits. They receive a definitive name as they grow up.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} [[Chinese emperor|Chinese]] and [[Japanese emperor]]s receive [[posthumous name]]s.

In some [[Polynesian culture]]s, the name of a deceased chief becomes [[taboo]]. If he is named after a common object or concept, a different word has to be used for it.

Depending on national convention, additional given names (and sometimes [[title]]s) are considered part of the name.

==Feudal names==
{{Disputed section|date=February 2013}}

The [[royal family|royalty]], [[nobility]], and [[gentry]] of Europe traditionally have many names, including phrases for the lands that they own. The French developed the method of putting the term by which the person is referred in [[small capital]] letters. It is this habit which transferred to names of the Far East, as seen below. An example is that of Marie-Joseph-Paul-Yves-Roch Gilbert du Motier, who is known as the &lt;span style="font-variant:small-caps"&gt;[[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette|Marquis de Lafayette]]&lt;/span&gt;. Notice that he possessed the lands both of Motier and Lafayette.

The bare place name was used formerly to refer to the person who owned it, rather than the land itself (the word "Gloucester" in "What will Gloucester do?" meant the [[Duke of Gloucester]]). As a development, the bare name of a ship in the [[Royal Navy]] meant its captain (e.g., "Cressy didn't learn from Aboukir") while the name with an article referred to the ship (e.g., "The ''Cressy'' is foundering").

==Naming conventions==
A personal naming system, or anthroponymic system, is a system describing the choice of personal name in a certain society. Personal names consists of one more parts, such as [[given name]], [[surname]] and [[patronymic]]. Personal naming systems are studied within the field of [[anthroponymy]].

In contemporary Western societies (except for [[Iceland]], [[Hungary]], and sometimes [[Flanders]], depending on the occasion), the most common naming convention is that a person must have a [[given name]], which is usually gender-specific, followed by the parents' [[family name]].  Some given names are bespoke, but most are repeated from earlier generations in the same culture.  Many are drawn from mythology, some of which span multiple language areas.  This has resulted in related names in different languages (e.g. [[George (given name)|George]], [[Georg (disambiguation)|Georg]], [[Jorge]]), which might be translated or might be maintained as immutable proper nouns.

In earlier times, Scandinavian countries followed patronymic naming, with people effectively called "X's son/daughter"; this is now the case only in [[Iceland]] and was recently re-introduced as an option in the [[Faroe Islands]]. It is legally possible in Finland as people of Icelandic ethnic naming are specifically named in the name law. When people of this name convert to standards of other cultures, the phrase is often condensed into one word, creating last names like Jacobsen (Jacob's Son). In [[Kafirstan]] (now part of Pakistan) "Children are named as soon as born. The infant is given to the mother to suckle, while a wise woman rapidly recites the family ancestral names; the name pronounced at the instant the baby begins to feed is that by which it is thereafter known." &lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Kafiristan] Encyclopedia Britannica, [[George Scott Robertson]]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a range of personal naming systems:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1 = Patrick|last1= Hanks|first2=Harry|last2= Parkin |editor= Carole Hough|chapter-url= https://books.google.com/books?id=S8DQCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA214 |chapter= Family names |title= The Oxford Handbook of Names and Naming  |location= New York |year= 2016 |publisher=  Oxford University Press |page=214 |isbn= 9780191630415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Binomial systems: apart for given name, people are described by their surnames, which they obtain from one of their parents. Most modern European personal naming systems, such as [[Russian name|Russian]] and [[Spanish name|Spanish]], are of this type.
* Patronymic systems: apart for given name, people are described by their [[patronymic]]s, that is given names (not surnames) of parents or other ancestors. Such systems were in wide use throughout Europe in the first millennium C.E., but were replaced by binomial systems. [[Icelandic name|Icelandic system]] is still patronymic.
* More complex systems like [[Arabic name|Arabic system]], consisting of [[paedonymic]] (son's name), given name, patronymic and one or two bynames.

Different cultures have different conventions for personal names. This is a list of articles about particular cultures' naming conventions.

== Name order ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Given name]] and [[Family name]] --&gt;
[[File:MomoiExpoCrop.png|thumb|[[Haruko Momoi]] at the [[Anime Expo]] 2007 in [[Los Angeles]]; her name card features a spelling of her [[Japanese name|name]] ("Halko Momoi") written in Western order; in Japanese her name is {{Nihongo2|桃井はるこ}} ''Momoi Haruko'']]

===Western name order===
The order ''given name, family name'' is commonly known as the Western order and is usually used in most [[Europe]]an countries and in countries that have cultures predominantly influenced by Western Europe (e.g. [[North America|North]] and [[South America|South]] [[Americas|America]], [[North India|North]], [[East India|East]], [[Central India|Central]] and [[Western India|West India]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and the [[Philippines]]).

Within alphabetic lists and catalogs, however, the family name is generally put first, with the given name(s) following, separated from it by a [[comma]] (e.g. Smith, John), representing the "lexical name order". This convention is followed by most Western libraries, as well as on many administrative forms.

===Eastern name order===
The order ''family name, given name'' is commonly known as the Eastern order and is primarily used in [[East Asia]] (for example in [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]] and [[Vietnam]]), as well as in [[Southeast Asia]] [[Cambodia]] and [[South India|Southern]] and North-Eastern parts of India, and also in [[Hungarian names|Hungary]] (the original [[Hungarian prehistory|homeland of the Hungarians]] was likely in Asia, at the southern foothills of the [[Ural Mountains]]). 
It is common in popular use also in [[Austria]] and [[Bavaria]], as well as in [[France]], [[Belgium]], [[Greece]], [[Italy]] and [[Romania]], possibly because of the influence of the bureaucratic use of putting the family name before the given name.

When East Asian names are [[transliteration|transliterated]] into the [[Latin alphabet]], some people prefer to convert them to the Western order, while others leave them in the Eastern order but write the family name in [[letter case|capital letters]]. To avoid confusion, there is a convention in some language communities, e.g. French, to write the family name in all capitals when engaging in formal correspondence or writing for an international audience. In Hungarian, the Eastern order of Japanese names is officially kept and Hungarian transliteration is used (e.g. Mijazaki Hajao), but Western name order is also sometimes used with English transliteration (e.g. Hayao Miyazaki).

Chinese people, except for those traveling or living outside of China and areas influenced by China, rarely reverse their Chinese language names to the western naming order (given name, then family name), but some may have non-Chinese given names which may use a different order.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=October 2013}} Western publications usually preserve the Chinese naming order, with the family name first, followed by the given name. In regard to Japanese names, most foreign publications reverse the names of modern individuals, and most Japanese reverse their own names when creating materials for foreign consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Terry, Edith. ''How Asia Got Rich: Japan, China and the Asian Miracle''. [[M.E. Sharpe]], 2002. [https://books.google.com/books?id=EzKBXxnkURkC&amp;pg=PA632&amp;dq=%22Japanese+names%22+surname&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3GU_TqC1OaLFsQKvq_22AQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Japanese%20names%22%20surname&amp;f=false 632]. Retrieved from [[Google Books]] on August 7, 2011. {{ISBN|0-7656-0356-X}}, {{ISBN|9780765603562}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In popular journalism publications, western order is used for Japanese names.&lt;ref name="Saeki"&gt;Saeki, Shizuka. "First Name Terms." ''[[Look Japan]]''. June 2001. Volume 47, No. 543. p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese names of contemporary individuals and Hungarian names are usually "switched" when individuals who have such names are mentioned in media in Western countries; for example, ''Koizumi Jun'ichirō'' is known as [[Junichiro Koizumi]] in English, and Puskás Ferenc is known as [[Ferenc Puskás]]. But Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese names are usually left in East Asian order; for instance, Máo Zédōng is known as [[Mao Zedong]] in English.

Names of Japanese or Chinese sportspeople generally follow the above conventions. For Japanese examples, see [[Ichiro Suzuki]] instead of ''Suzuki Ichirō'' (although he is widely known simply as "Ichiro" in both Japan and North America), or [[Hidetoshi Nakata]] instead of ''Nakata Hidetoshi''. As for Chinese sportspeople, ''Yáo Míng'' is [[Yao Ming]] and ''Liú Xiáng'' is [[Liu Xiang (hurdler)|Liu Xiang]] in the West.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Names of Korean sportspeople may be rendered in East Asian or Western order in Western countries, apparently depending on the sport. For example, names of Korean [[football (soccer)|footballers]] and [[Sportsperson|athletes]] are usually left in East Asian order (e.g. [[Ahn Jung-hwan]], [[Hong Myung-bo]], [[Park Ji-Sung]], [[Sohn Kee-chung]], [[Hwang Young-cho]]). [[Baseball]] players' names are usually changed to Western order; for example Park Chan-Ho is referred to in the West as [[Chan-ho Park]]. [[Golf]]ers' names are also typically switched to Western order; the female golfer Pak Se-ri is known in the West as [[Se-Ri Pak]]. Confusion can be avoided by noticing that in all the above cases, the words linked by a hyphen are the given name.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

[[Mordvins]] use two names - a Mordvin name and a Russian name. The Mordvin name is written in the Eastern name order. Usually, the Mordvin surname is the same as the Russian surname, for example [[Aleksandr Sharonov|Sharonon Sandra]] (Russian: Alexander Sharonov), but it can be different at times, for example [[Yovlan Olo]] (Russian: Vladimir Romashkin).

Mongolians use the Eastern naming order (patronymic followed by given name), which is also used there when rendering the names of other East Asians and Hungarians. Russian and other Western names, however, are still written in Western order.

==Non-human personal names==
Apart from the [[Linnaean taxonomy]], some humans give individual non-human animals and plants names, usually of endearment.

===Names of pets===
Pet names often reflect the owner's view of the animal, and their expectations they have for their companion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ISnH9lrVYhYC&amp;pg=PA127 The complete idiot's guide to pet psychic communication], Debbie McGillivray, Eve Adamson, Alpha Books, 2004, {{ISBN|1-59257-214-6}}, {{ISBN|978-1-59257-214-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VoxbJ_oF7LAC&amp;pg=PA10 Adopting a Pet For Dummies] Page 10, By Eve Adamson&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that giving names allows researchers to view their pets as [[ontologically]] different from unnamed [[laboratory animal]]s with which they work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/a5k7231264jl2j22/ Proper names and the social construction of biography: The negative case of laboratory animals], Mary T. Phillips, Qualitative Sociology, Volume 17, Number 2, SpringerLink&lt;/ref&gt;

The name given to a pet may refer to its appearance&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ekn0Zm2jUBgC&amp;pg=PA1 The Best Pet Name Book Ever!], Chapter 1, By Wayne Bryant Eldridge&lt;/ref&gt; or personality,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ekn0Zm2jUBgC&amp;pg=PA7 The Best Pet Name Book Ever!], Chapter 2, By Wayne Bryant Eldridge&lt;/ref&gt; or be chosen for [[endearment]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ekn0Zm2jUBgC&amp;pg=PA23 The Best Pet Name Book Ever!], Chapter 4, By Wayne Bryant Eldridge&lt;/ref&gt; or in honor of a favorite [[celebrity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://popwatch.ew.com/2009/09/28/what-celebrity-would-you-name-your-pet-after/ What celebrity would you name your pet after?], by Margaret Lyons, Sep 28 2009, Entertainment Weekly&lt;/ref&gt;

Many pet owners give human names to their pets. This has been shown to reflect the owner having a human-like relationship with the pet.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ekn0Zm2jUBgC&amp;pg=PA13 The Best Pet Name Book Ever!], Chapter 3, By Wayne Bryant Eldridge&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cultures, [[pet]]s or sporting [[animal]]s are sometimes given names similar to human names. Other cultures, such as the [[Han Chinese|Chinese]], give animals nonhuman names because it would be seen as offensive and disrespectful to the person of the same name.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Dolphin names for each other===
A study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences claims that humans are not the only animals that use personal names. Researchers from the University of North Carolina Wilmington studying [[bottlenose dolphin]]s in Sarasota Bay, Florida, found that the dolphins had names for each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/TECH/science/05/09/dolphins.names.reut/index.html |title=Dolphins, like humans, recognize names, May 9, 2006,CNN|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060602074304/http://www.cnn.com/2006/TECH/science/05/09/dolphins.names.reut/index.html |archivedate=2006-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; A dolphin chooses its name as an infant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/animals/060508_dolphin_names.html Dolphins Name Themselves], By Bjorn Carey, posted: 8 May 2006, livescience.com&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Polybiography''' is the use of [[Email archiving|archived internet email services]] such as ListServs and WWWeb to publish historical information by those involved in the history. The historical web site and ListServ provide for formal historical articles, images, photographs, commentary, and discussion of those items in a process called a "polybiography"... the history by many of the many events.  The site is designed to be a [[Digital library#Searching|searchable repository]] of "raw material" for those with an interest in the history of [[Diagnostic Medical Sonography]] ([[ultrasonography]]).

This Internet based [[archive|historical archive]] has been referred to as a "polybiography" because it is both [[biographical]] and [[autobiographical]]; the many individuals involved write the history of the many events discussed. The resulting [[archive]] is expected to be similar to an [[oral history]] where an editor records and transcribes the various stories into a cohesive narrative. However, the oral history will have a slant due to the selection of participants and how they are edited. The polybiography will avoid a bias or slant from an editor because the participants are [[self-selected]]. The stories will be in the unedited words of the individuals who made the history. The primary problem anticipated will be the differences in individuals' writing styles, and a possibly confused organization.

The polybiography is uniquely adapted to the Internet and would be virtually impossible without the Internet. Without the global connections it would be difficult to locate all the individuals who contributed to the development of historical events. By the use of the Internet anyone who has a story to tell about the developments will be able to add to the history. This will allow those who were assistants to contribute, as well as the luminaries; where as with the traditional oral history, the editor might not locate some relatively minor, relocated participants.

The concept of the "polybiography" was first presented at the Annual Conference 2000 of the American Association of History &amp; Computing in [[Waco, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;THE JOURNAL OF EDUCATION, COMMUNITY, AND VALUES, http://bcis.pacificu.edu/journal/2002/04/dubose.php, accessed November 23, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DuBose TJ; "A Poly-Autobiography of Sonography"; Proceedings [[American Association of History &amp; Computing]], Waco, Texas April 13–15, 2000. http://www.theaahc.org/, last access: February 21, 2001 http://www.theaahc.org/&lt;/ref&gt; The original article was titled "Poly-autobiography of [[Diagnostic Medical Sonography]]",&lt;ref&gt;SDMS &amp; OBGYN.net; Ultrasound-History Forum &amp; Archives: http://forums.obgyn.net/ultrasound-history/; last access: February 21, 2001
&lt;/ref&gt; but during the discussion following the presentation it was suggested that, while the concept was thought to be a unique use of the Internet and WWWeb, the term "polybiography" would be more appropriate, more descriptive, and simpler.

A '''posthumous name''' is an honorary name given to royalty, nobles, and sometimes others, in [[East Asia]] after the person's death, and is used almost exclusively instead of one's personal name or other official titles during their life. The posthumous name is commonly used when naming royalty of [[Table of Chinese monarchs|China]], [[List of Korean monarchs|Korea]], [[List of Vietnamese monarchs|Vietnam]], and [[emperors of Japan|Japan]].

Posthumous names in China and Vietnam were also given to honor lifetime accomplishments of many people who did not have hereditary titles &amp;ndash; for example, to successful courtiers.

A posthumous name should not be confused with the [[era name]] and [[temple name]].

==Use==
The posthumous name consists of one or more adjectives inserted before the ruler's current title. As rulers from different states might share the same posthumous name, but rulers ''within'' a state would usually not repeat an already used name, the name of the state or domain is usually also given to avoid ambiguity. In Chinese the whole construct is therefore "[state][adjective][title]", which in English is typically translated as "[title][adjective] of [state]", such as [[King Wen of Zhou]], [[Duke Mu of Qin]], and [[King Cheng of Chu]]. The literal meaning of the adjective is normally not translated.

While the names of living Chinese can be just about any combination of characters, the posthumous name was chosen from a rather small pool of stock characters; the literal meaning of which eroded as a result.

== History ==

===Origins===
Early mythological rulers such as [[Emperor Yao]] are considered to have posthumous names.&lt;ref&gt;''Yiwen Leiju'', vols. [[:zh:s:藝文類聚/卷014|014]]&lt;/ref&gt; All rulers of [[Shang Dynasty]] are known only by their posthumous names, as their personal names were not recorded in classical texts.

Archaeological discoveries have shown that early kings of the [[Zhou dynasty]], such as [[King Wen of Zhou|King Wen]] and [[King Wu of Zhou|King Wu]], used "posthumous names" during their lifetime, but later they became chosen by successors after the ruler's death. As a result, final rulers of states and rulers seen as illegitimate (such as usurpers) often do not have posthumous names and are referred to by their personal names, e.g. [[Jian, King of Qi]]; [[Min, Marquis of Jin]]; and [[Chen Tuo]].

The use of posthumous names was stopped in the [[Qin Dynasty]], because [[Qin Shi Huang]] proclaimed that it is disrespectful for the descendants, or "later emperors" to judge their elders, or the "prior emperors" (先帝). The practice was revived in the [[Han Dynasty]] after the demise of Qin.

===Decline in use===
Posthumous names are the conventional way of referring to rulers from the Zhou dynasty to the Sui dynasty. In the Zhou dynasty the posthumous name was usually only one character, such as "Wen" (cultured) or "Wu" (martial). However, as time went on rulers began to add more and more characters to the posthumous names of their ancestors. By the time of the [[Emperor Gaozu of Tang|first emperor of Tang]] the length had grown to 7 characters, which was taxing to pronounce or write. Therefore, emperors from Tang on are commonly referred to by either their [[temple name]] (Tang through Yuan dynasties) or [[era name]] (Ming and Qing dynasties), both of which are always just two characters long and therefore easy to remember and use.

===Later developments===

Posthumous names commonly made tracing linear genealogies simpler and kept a blood line apparent. The rule was also followed by non-[[Han Chinese]] rulers of [[Sixteen Kingdoms]], [[Silla]], [[Japan]], [[Kingdom of Nanzhao]], [[Liao dynasty]], [[Vietnam]], [[Western Xia]], [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]], [[Yuan dynasty]] and [[Qing dynasty]]. King names of [[Hồng Bàng dynasty]] and [[List of legendary monarchs of Korea#Mahan|Mahan]] also followed the rule but they are thought to be later work.

Some rulers, such as [[Wu Zetian]], or rebel leaders also had similar style [[regnal name]]s when they were alive.

Most monarchs inherited the throne and did not give bad posthumous names to the previous monarch. Some names were lengthened or changed by later monarchs. [[Emperor Aizong of Jin]] and [[Chongzhen Emperor]] had different names from different people. [[Qin Hui (Song dynasty)|Qin Hui]], of the Song dynasty, had a good name, was given a bad one, and had the good name later restored.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/xhfk/2010-08/11/c_12433570.htm 韩侂胄——《宋史》中的一缕冤魂]&lt;/ref&gt; After the Song dynasty few received bad names.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncue.edu.tw/~ccource/data/12.doc 從文臣諡號看明清諡法理論，宋秉仁] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930152451/http://www.ncue.edu.tw/~ccource/data/12.doc |date=2007-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bad monarchs of the [[Joseon dynasty]] did not receive posthumous names.

Emperors of China continued to receive posthumous names of increasing length as a matter of ritual long after the naming convention had been abandoned in casual speech and writing. The [[Guangxu Emperor]], who died in 1908 and was the last emperor to receive a posthumous name, sports the impressive 21-character title of "Emperor Tongtian Chongyun Dazhong Zhizheng Jingwen Weiwu Renxiao Ruizhi Duanjian Kuanqin Jing of Qing".

[[Puyi]], the last emperor of China, did not receive a posthumous name upon his death in 1967 since he died at the height of the [[Cultural Revolution]], when such practices would have been thought feudal.

Use of posthumous names ceased in China with the [[Guangxu Emperor]] (d.1908), in Vietnam with the [[Khải Định|Khải Định Emperor]] (d.1925) and in Korea with the [[Sunjong of Korea|Yunghui Emperor]] (d.1926). However, in Korea unofficial posthumous names were given to [[Crown Prince Euimin]] and [[Gu, Prince Imperial Hoeun]].

===Contemporary Japanese use===
Posthumous names are in use to this day in Japan. A deceased emperor is given a posthumous name, which beginning with [[Emperor Meiji]] (d.1912) is identical to his era name and therefore always two characters long. The most recently conferred posthumous name is that of [[Hirohito|Emperor Showa]] (d.1989).

A non-royal deceased person may be given a posthumous [[Dharma name|Buddhist name]] known as ''kaimyo'', but is in practice still referred to by the living name.

==Guidelines==

===Selection===
Posthumous names can be praises (褒字) or deprecations (貶字). There are more praises than deprecations, so posthumous names are also commonly called ''respectful names'' (尊號 zūn hào) in Chinese. [[Sima Qian]]'s ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' outlines extensively the rules behind choosing the names.&lt;ref&gt;明朱睦《易学识遗》辑古谥法十二家，曰《史记谥法解》，曰《周书谥法》，曰《蔡邕独断谥法》，曰《苏洵谥法》，曰《周公谥法》，曰《春秋谥法》，曰《广谥法》，曰《沈约谥法》，曰《贺琛谥法》，曰《扈蒙谥法》，曰《郑樵谥法》，曰《陈思谥法》&lt;/ref&gt; Some of those guidelines:

* Praises
** Those having a persistent and reasonable governance (剛強直理) are called "Martial" (武 wǔ). (This is one of the most honourable names.)
** Those who sympathize with the people and recognize their needs (憫民會椅) are called "Civil" (文 wén). (This is one of the most honourable names.)
** Those who respect the talented and value righteousness (尊賢貴義) are called "Reverent" (恭 gòng).
** Those who are kind and benevolent in nature (溫柔賢善) are called "Benign" (懿 yì).
** Those who aid the people out of righteousness (由義而濟) are called "Admirable" (景 jǐng).
** Those who treat the people compassionately with a gentle quality (柔質慈民) are called "Compassionate" (惠 huì).
** Those who eliminate destructions and purge cruelty (除殘去虐) are called "Tang" (湯 tāng). Possibly named after the revered ruler [[Cheng Tang]] (成湯), the founder of the [[Shang Dynasty]].
** Those who make the people feel satisfied with their policies (安民立政) are called "Constructive" (成 chéng). Again, possibly named after Cheng Tang.
** Those who are considerate and far-sighted (果慮果遠) are called "Brilliant" (明 míng).
** Those who preach their virtue and righteousness to the people (布德執義) are called "Majestic" (穆 mù).
** Those who are aggressive to expand their realm (辟土服遠) are called "Exploratory" (桓 huán).
** "Highly (respected)" (高 gāo) is particularly reserved for the founders of dynasties.
* Deprecations
** Those who lived short lives without much accomplishment (短折不成) are called "Passed Away Prematurely" (殤 shāng).
** Those who have a constant twinge of [[depression (mood)|depression]] (often due to political plights) during their governance (在國遭憂) are called "Pitiful" (愍 mǐn).
** Those who lose their spouses and pass away at their early age (蚤孤短折) are called "Lamentable" (哀 āi).
** Those who are obliged to make sacrifices to their ancestors (肆行勞祀) are called "Mournful" (悼 dào). 
&lt;!---   ** Those who are () are called "" ( ). --&gt;

However, most of these qualifications are subjective, repetitive, and highly [[stereotypical]]; hence the names are chosen somewhat arbitrarily. Such names are usually given by court historians, according to their good deeds or the bad ones.

When combining an emperor's temple name and posthumous name, the temple name is placed first. For example, the [[Shunzhi Emperor]] whose full posthumous name would be "Shi Zu - Zhang Huang Di" (世祖章皇帝), combining the last 2 characters of his temple name and the last 3 of his posthumous name, which is the form most commonly seen in old documents. A fuller description of this naming convention for royalty appears in the [[Chinese sovereign]] entry. The posthumous names of some monarchs and royal members were long, for example [[Hongwu Emperor]], [[Nurhaci]], [[:zh:朝鮮文祖|Crown Prince Hyomyeong]], [[Sunjo of Joseon]] and [[Empress Dowager Cixi]].

Some monarchs did not follow these guidelines. Some monarchs of [[Ju (state)|Ju]], [[Chu (state)|Chu]], and [[Qi (Henan)|Qi]] used place names. Some monarchs of [[Yue (state)]] had Chinese transliterated posthumous names. Some monarchs of [[Goguryeo]], [[Silla]] and [[Baekje]] had different style posthumous names. Some early Japan monarchs also had Japanese-style posthumous names (和風諡号).

==China==

===Emperors and empresses===

All Chinese posthumous names for rulers end in one or two of the [[Chinese character|characters]] for "[[emperor of China|emperor]]", ''Huángdì'' (皇帝, i.e. emperor), which can be shortened to ''Dì''; except about a dozen or so less recognized ones who have had only ''Dì'' and no ''Huáng''.

Starting with Emperor [[Emperor Wen of Han|Xiaowen of Han]] (more commonly "Emperor Wen"), every single Han emperor, except the first one of the Eastern Han Dynasty, has the character of "[[filial piety|filial]]" (孝 xiào) at the beginning of his posthumous names. "Filial" is also used in the full posthumous names of virtually all emperors and empresses of the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]], [[Song Dynasty|Song]], [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] Dynasties. For Qing emperors, 孝 xiào is placed in various position in the string of characters, while those Qing empresses who were given posthumous names, 孝 xiào is always initial.

The number of characters in posthumous names was increasing. The emperors of the [[Tang Dynasty]] have names in between seven and eighteen characters. Those in the [[Qing Dynasty]] have twenty-one characters. For instance, that of the [[Shunzhi Emperor]] was "The Emperor of Order who Observes the Heavenly Rituals with a Solemn Fate, Destined to Unify, Establishes with Extreme Talented Insights, Admires the Arts, Manifests the Might, with Great Virtue and Vast Achievement, Reaches Humanity, Purely Filial" (體天隆運定統建極英睿欽文顯武大德弘功至仁純孝章皇帝,  {{Audio|Chinese-Emperor Shunzhi posthumous name.ogg|Listen to pronunciation}}: tǐ tiān lóng yùn dìng tǒng jiàn jí yīng ruì qīn wén xiǎn wǔ dà dé hóng gōng zhì rén chún xiào zhāng huáng dì).

The woman with the longest posthumous name is [[Empress Dowager Cixi]], who is "The Empress who is Admirably Filial, Initiates Kindness, with Blessed Health, Manifests Much Contentment, Solemn Sincerity, with Longevity, Provides Admiration Prosperously, Reveal Adoration, Prosperous with a Merry Heaven, with a Holy Appearance" (孝欽慈禧端佑康頤昭豫莊誠壽恭欽獻崇熙配天興聖顯皇后 xiào qīn cí xǐ duān yòu kāng yí zhāo yù zhuāng chéng shòu gōng qīn xiàn chóng xī pèi tiān xīng shèng xiǎn huáng hòu), or 孝欽顯皇后 for short.

===Imperial family===

According to the noble system since the [[Zhou Dynasty]], the immediate family members of the Emperor were given the titles of Kings (or Princes), Dukes, Earls, etc., with or without actual control over a region of land. After their death, they would be referred to by the same title, with the posthumous name (usually one character) inserted in the middle. The characters used are mostly the same ones used for emperors, with the same denotations as described above. For example, [[Prince Gong (Qing dynasty)|Prince Gong]] of the [[Qing Dynasty]] was posthumously named Zhong (忠), and thus is referred to as Prince Gongzhong (恭忠親王 Gongzhong qīnwáng); [[Yixuan, Prince Chun|Prince Chun]] was posthumous named Xian (賢), hence is referred Prince Chunxian (醇賢親王 Chunxian qīnwáng).

===Officials===
It was also common for persons with no hereditary titles, especially accomplished scholar-officials or ministers, to be given posthumous names by the imperial court. The characters used are mostly the same ones used for emperors, with the same denotations as described above. The length, however, was restricted to one or two characters. The posthumous name is sometimes rendered [[canonization]] in English, for the scholar-official to Confucianism is analogous to the saint in the Catholic Church, though the process is not nearly as long. See [[List of Posthumous Names]] for some examples.

[[Confucius]] has been given long posthumous names in almost every major dynasty. One of the most commonly used was Zhìshèngxiānshī 至聖先師.

Sometimes a person is given a posthumous name not by the court, but by his own family or disciples. Such names are private posthumous names (Sĩshì, 私諡). For example, [[Tao Yuanming|Tao Qian]] was given ''Sishi'' Jìngjié 靖節.

==Korea==
In [[Korea]], [[Goguryeo]] kings were mostly given posthumous names after their burial places, or in case of [[Gwanggaeto of Goguryeo|Gwanggaeto]], the name described his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/Article.aspx?aid=3006407|title=Of tombs and posthumous names|date=2015-07-09|accessdate=2016-06-03|publisher=[[Korea JoongAng Daily]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Silla]], every monarchs were given the titles of ''wang'' (왕, "king") with two characters in posthumous names from [[Jijeung of Silla]]. On the other hand, all posthumous names for kings of [[Balhae]] were restricted to one character.

Most of the kings of [[Goryeo]] and [[Joseon]] were called [[temple name]] more than posthumous name unlike dynasties of ancient Korea. This is a longer name, made up of adjectives characteristic of the king's rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/common/printpreview.asp?categoryCode=628&amp;newsIdx=153615|title=Rediscovering aesthetics of Jongmyo Shrine |publisher=Korea Times|accessdate=2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archontology.org/nations/korea/01_notes.php|title=Korea: Notes|publisher=archontology.org|accessdate=2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART000927530|title=조선시대 국왕호칭의 종류와 의미  The Kinds and Meaning of King's Name in the Chosun Dynasty|publisher=NRF|journal=역사와경계 |year=2004|issue=52|pages=46–67|language=English, Korean|accessdate=2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Gwangjong of Goryeo]]'s posthumous name was Hongdoseon Yeolpyeongse Sukheonui Hyoganghye Daeseong Daewang (홍도선열평세숙헌의효강혜대성대왕), while his temple name was Gwangjong. Details of the system of posthumous name were made during the Joseon Dynasty. During the Joseon Dynasty, After five days the king's funeral, officials discussed and decided the king's posthumous name. The Ministry of Culture and Education (예조, 禮曹) was in charge of the naming. Also, Shorn of his power, the deposed king has not been given any posthumous names with temple name unless reinstated. They were degraded to the rank of ''gun'' (군, "prince"). [[Yeonsangun of Joseon|Yeonsan-gun]] and [[Gwanghaegun of Joseon|Gwanghae-gun]] were are notable examples.

[[Crown Prince Hyomyeong]] has been given longest posthumous names in Korea. He were posthumously elevated in status and given the title Emperor Munjo with with 113 characters in posthumous names in 1899.

==Japan==
In Japan, posthumous names are called ''shigō'' (諡号), ''okuri-na'' (諡), or ''tsuigo'' (追号). Those of Japanese emperors are also sometimes called ''teigō'' (帝号, "emperor name[s]").

There are two styles in emperors' posthumous names, namely Chinese style and Japanese style. In addition to the appellation ''Tennō'' (天皇, "heavenly sovereign", usually translated as ''Emperor'') that is a part of all Japanese emperors' posthumous name, most of them consist of two [[kanji]] characters, although a few consist of three. Some names are given several generations later—this is the case for [[Emperor Jimmu]] and [[Emperor Antoku]], for example. Others are given immediately after death, like that of [[Emperor Monmu]].

Many have Chinese-style names, for example:
* [[Emperor Jimmu]] (神武天皇 ''Jinmu Tennō'', lit. ''Divine Might'')
* [[Emperor Nintoku]] (仁徳天皇 ''Nintoku Tennō'', lit. ''Humane  Virtue'')
* [[Emperor Ōjin]] (応神天皇 ''Ōjin Tennō'', lit. ''Answering the Gods'')

Some have Japanese-style names. For example:
* those who were named after the place where the emperor was born, lived or frequented:
** [[Emperor Saga]] (嵯峨天皇 ''Saga Tennō''), named after a [[palace]] (院 ''in'')
** [[Emperor Ichijo|Emperor Ichijō]] (一条天皇 ''Ichijō Tennō''), named after an official residence (邸 ''tei'')
** [[Emperor Kōmyō]] (光明天皇 ''Kōmyō Tennō''), named after a [[temple]]
** [[Emperor Higashiyama]] (東山天皇 ''Higashiyama Tennō''), named after a [[hill]]
* those who were named after an emperor whose admirable characteristics resemble those of an earlier one by adding ''Go'' (後, lit. ''latter'') as a prefix to the earlier emperor's name:
** [[Emperor Go-Ichijo|Emperor Go-Ichijō]]  (後一条天皇 ''Go-Ichijō Tennō'')
** [[Emperor Go-Daigo]] (後醍醐天皇 ''Go-Daigo Tennō'')
** [[Empress Go-Sakuramachi]] (後桜町天皇 ''Go-Sakuramachi Tennō'')
* those who were named by combining the characters from two previous emperors' names:
** [[Empress Genmei|Empress Gen'''mei''']] (元明天皇 ''Genmei Tennō'') + [[Empress Genshō|Empress Gen'''shō''']] (元正天皇 ''Genshō Tennō'') = [[Empress Meishō|Empress '''Meishō''']] (明正天皇 ''Meishō Tennō'')
** [[Empress Kōken|Empress '''Shō'''toku]] (称徳天皇 ''Shōtoku Tennō'') + [[Emperor Kōnin|Emperor '''Kō'''nin]] (光仁天皇 ''Kōnin Tennō'') = [[Emperor Shōkō|Emperor '''Shōkō''']] (称光天皇 ''Shōkō Tennō'')

Since the death of [[Emperor Meiji]] (明治天皇 ''Meiji Tennō'') in 1912, the posthumous name of an emperor has always been the name of his [[Japanese era name|era]].  For example, after his death, [[Hirohito]] (by which he is usually called outside Japan) was formally renamed '''Emperor Shōwa''' (昭和天皇 ''Shōwa Tennō'') after [[Shōwa period|his era]]; Japanese now refer to him by only that name. ''Hirohito'' was his given name; most Japanese never refer to their emperors by their given names, [[Naming taboo#In other countries|as it is considered disrespectful]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4943">'''Production babies''' are children born to anyone involved in the making of a film during its [[filmmaking|production]]. The phrase generally refers to a section of the [[closing credits]] of films, listing the babies' [[given name]]s. The custom of publishing lists of production babies began with [[animated film]]s, and is still chiefly found in that genre, reflecting the influence of family experiences on storytelling in such films.&lt;ref name=sfgate2010/&gt;

The first list of production babies was included by [[Pixar]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dawson|first=Jonathan|title=Cars|url=http://www.abc.net.au/tasmania/stories/s1664829.htm|work=Review|publisher=[[ABC Tasmania]]|accessdate=January 16, 2012|date=June 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the credits of their first full-length movie ''[[Toy Story]]'' in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0114709|Toy Story}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lee Unkrich]], a film director with Pixar, explains that the production team and [[film crew]] indelibly associate the birth of each of their children with the film they were working on at the time. The listing in the end credits becomes a way for them to share these essential memories more widely. "It's like our family lives are permanently woven into the movies."&lt;ref name=sfgate2010&gt;{{cite web|last=Hartlaub|first=Peter|title=Pixar delivers, babies get credit|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2010-06-13/entertainment/21907955_1_toy-story-john-lasseter-pixar|publisher=[[SFGate]]|accessdate=January 8, 2012|date=June 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twists added in film credits include a list of "Chameleon Babies" at the end of the 2010 animated film ''[[Tangled]]'', born to the real-life model for the pet in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Liu|first=Ed|title=A Virtual Roundtable with "Tangled" Co-Directors Byron Howard &amp; Nathan Greno|url=http://www.toonzone.net/news/articles/36987/a-virtual-roundtable-with-tangled-co-directors-byron-howard-amp-nathan-greno|publisher=ToonZone.net|accessdate=January 16, 2012|date=April 7, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822013323/http://www.toonzone.net/news/articles/36987/a-virtual-roundtable-with-tangled-co-directors-byron-howard-amp-nathan-greno|archivedate=August 22, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 animated film ''[[Winnie the Pooh (2011 film)|Winnie the Pooh]]'' lists the names under "Pooh Babies," with the credit knitted on a piece of fabric by the character [[Kanga (Winnie-the-Pooh)|Kanga]].

[[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] film director [[Byron Howard]] cites the listing of production babies as a pointer to the depth of personal relationships established during collaboration on an animated movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hucks|first=Dustin|title=Interviews: The Cast of'' 'Tangled' ''Gets Unraveled|url=http://www.filmschoolrejects.com/features/interviews-the-cast-of-tangled-gets-unraveled.php|publisher=FilmSchoolRejects.com|accessdate=January 8, 2012|date=November 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A star next to a baby's name honors a baby who passed away before production was complete.

In 2009, [[Ari Folman]] dedicated his [[Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Golden Globe Award]] to the eight production babies born during the making of ''[[Waltz with Bashir]]'', an animated anti-war documentary, and expressed hope that their lives would have no contact with the realities of conflict depicted in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Israel's 'Waltz with Bashir,' on 1982 Lebanon War, wins Golden Globe for best foreign film|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/israel-s-waltz-with-bashir-on-1982-lebanon-war-wins-golden-globe-for-best-foreign-film-1.267916|accessdate=January 8, 2012|newspaper=[[Haaretz]]|date=January 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewers have noted that "production babies" credits indicate the creativity of film people in giving some unusual names to their children.&lt;ref name=sfgate2010/&gt;

An early, isolated instance in video games occurred with an [[Easter egg (media)#Software|easter egg]] message embedded in the ROM for the 1988 game ''Spiker! Super Pro Volleyball'' for Mattel [[Intellivision]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The First Production Baby|url=http://daddytypes.com/2013/01/15/the_first_production_baby.php |date=January 15, 2013 |publisher=DaddyTypes |accessdate=January 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern custom spread to [[video game]] credits in the 2005 game ''[[Call of Duty 2]]'', and the 2009 game ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2]]'', which also listed the other parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2/credits|work=Credits|publisher=[[MobyGames]]|accessdate=January 8, 2012|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title of the list was changed to "Development Babies" in ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3]]''. A number of other games have since done the same.

A '''shield-maiden''' ({{lang-non|skjaldmær}}), in [[Scandinavian folklore]] and [[Norse mythology|mythology]] was a female warrior. They are often mentioned in [[saga]]s such as ''[[Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks]]'' and in ''[[Gesta Danorum]]''. Shield-maidens also appear in stories of other [[Germanic peoples]]: [[Goths]], [[Cimbri]], and [[Marcomanni]].&lt;ref name="nordisk"&gt;[http://runeberg.org/nfce/0728.html The article ''Sköldmö''] in ''[[Nordisk familjebok]]'' (1917).&lt;/ref&gt; The mythical [[valkyrie]]s may have been based on the shield-maidens.&lt;ref name="nordisk"/&gt;

==Historical existence==
The historical existence of shield-maidens is heavily debated, but scholars including [[Neil Price (archaeologist)|Neil Price]],&lt;ref name="history.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/shows/vikings/videos/secrets-of-the-vikings-shield-maidens|title=Secrets of the Vikings: Shield Maidens|website=www.history.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125132543/http://www.history.com/shows/vikings/videos/secrets-of-the-vikings-shield-maidens|archivedate=25 January 2016|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that they existed while others, like scholar Judith Jesch disagree, citing a lack of hard evidence for trained or regular women warriors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.britishmuseum.org/2014/04/19/viking-women-warriors-and-valkyries/|title=Viking women, warriors, and valkyries|website=blog.britishmuseum.org|date=19 April 2014|first=Judith|last=Jesch|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303194313/http://blog.britishmuseum.org/2014/04/19/viking-women-warriors-and-valkyries/|archivedate=3 March 2016|deadurl=yes|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/14/world/europe/sweden-viking-women-warriors-dna.html|title=A Female Viking Warrior?

==Historical accounts==
There are few historic attestations that [[Viking Age]] women took part in warfare, but the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] historian [[John Skylitzes]] records that women fought in battle when [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev]] attacked the Byzantines in [[Bulgaria]] in 971.&lt;ref name="Harrison"/&gt; When the [[Varangians]] (not to be confused with the Byzantine [[Varangian Guard]]) had suffered a devastating defeat in the [[Siege of Dorostolon]], the victors were stunned at discovering armed women among the fallen warriors.&lt;ref name="Harrison"&gt;Harrison, D. &amp; Svensson, K. (2007). ''Vikingaliv''. Fälth &amp; Hässler, Värnamo. {{ISBN|978-91-27-35725-9}}. p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Leif Erikson]]'s pregnant half-sister [[Freydís Eiríksdóttir]] was in [[Vinland]], she is reported to have taken up a sword, and, bare-breasted, scared away the attacking [[Skræling]]s.&lt;ref name="Harrison"/&gt; The fight is recounted in the ''[[Greenland saga]]'', though Freydís is not explicitly referred to as a shield-maiden in the text.&lt;ref name=Thorsson&gt;Thorsson, Ö. (Ed.) ''The Sagas of the Icelanders.'' Penguin Books, 1997. Anyway a mention of a single woman picking up a sword once can not be considered evidence of actual trained  female warriors.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saxo Grammaticus reported that shield-maidens fought on the side of the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] at the [[Battle of Brávellir]] in the year 750:
{{quote|Now out of the town of Sle, under the captains [[Heiðr|Hetha]] (Heid) and Wisna, with Hakon Cut-cheek came Tummi the Sailmaker.

==Legendary accounts==
Examples of shield-maidens mentioned by name in the Norse sagas include [[Brynhildr]] in the ''[[Vǫlsunga saga]]'', [[Hervor]] in ''[[Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks]]'', the Brynhildr of the ''[[Bósa saga ok Herrauðs]]'', the Swedish princess Thornbjǫrg in ''[[Hrólfs saga Gautrekssonar]]'' and Princess Hed, Visna and [[Veborg]] in ''[[Gesta Danorum]]''.

Two shield-maidens appear in certain translations of the ''Hervarar saga''. The first of these Hervors was known to have taken up typically masculine roles early in her childhood and often raided travelers in the woods dressed as a man. Later in her life, she claimed the cursed sword [[Tyrfing]] from her father's burial site and became a seafaring raider.  She eventually settled and married. Her granddaughter was also named Hervor and commanded forces against attacking [[Huns]]. Although the saga remarks on her bravery she is mortally wounded by enemy forces and dies on the battlefield.&lt;ref name=Tolkien&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholars Judith Jesch and Jenny Jochens theorize that shield-maidens' often grim fates or their sudden return to typically female roles is a testament to their role as figures of both male and female fantasy as well as emblematic of the danger of abandoning gender roles.&lt;ref name=Tolkien&gt;{{cite web|last=Tolkien|first=Christopher|title=The Saga of King Heidrik the Wise|url=http://vsnrweb-publications.org.uk/The%20Saga%20Of%20King%20Heidrek%20The%20Wise.pdf|publisher=Thomas Nelson and Sons Ltd.|accessdate=April 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brynhildr Buðladóttir and Guðrún Gjúkadóttir===
{{Main|Brynhildr}}
Brynhildr of the ''Vǫlsunga saga'', along with her rival in love, [[Gudrun|Guðrún Gjúkadóttir]], provides an example of how a shield-maiden compares to more conventional aristocratic womanhood in the sagas.  Brynhildr is chiefly concerned with honor, much like a male warrior.  When she ends up married to Gudrun's brother [[Gunther|Gunnarr]] instead of [[Sigurd|Sigurðr]], the man she intended to marry, Brynhildr speaks a verse comparing the courage of the two men:
{{quote|
&lt;poem&gt;Sigurd fought the dragon
And that afterward will be
Forgotten by no one
While men still live.
Yet your brother
Neither dared
To ride into the fire
Nor to leap across it.&lt;ref name=Byock&gt;Byock, Jesse L. (Trans.) ''Saga of the Volsungs.''University of California Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Brynhildr is married to Gunnarr and not Sigurðr because of deceit and trickery, including a potion of forgetfulness given to Sigurðr so he forgets his previous relationship with her.&lt;ref name=Byock/&gt; Brynhildr is upset not only for the loss of Sigurðr but also for the dishonesty involved. Similar to her male counterparts, the shield-maiden prefers to do things straightforwardly, without the deception considered stereotypically feminine in much of medieval literature. She enacts her vengeance directly, resulting in the deaths of herself, Sigurðr, and Sigurð's son by Guðrún. By killing the child, she demonstrates an understanding of feud and filial responsibility; if he lived, the boy would grow up to take vengeance on Brynhildr's family.

Guðrún has a similar concern with family ties, but at first does not usually act directly. She is more inclined to incite her male relatives to action than take up arms herself. Guðrún is no shield-maiden, and Brynhildr mocks her for this, saying, "Only ask what is best for you to know. That is suitable for noble women. And it is easy to be satisfied while everything happens according to your desires."&lt;ref name=Byock/&gt; In her later marriages, however, she is willing to kill her children, burn down a hall, and send her other sons to avenge the murder of her daughter, Svanhildr. In the world of the sagas, women can be both honorable and remorseless, much like the male heroes. While a shield-maiden does not fill a woman's typical role, her strength of character is found in even the more domestic women in these stories.

==Archaeology==
Graves of female settlers containing weapons have been uncovered, but scholars do not agree how these should be interpreted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sciencenordic.com/don’t-underestimate-viking-women|title=Don’t underestimate Viking women|date=2 January 2013|first=Arild S.|last=Foss|website=sciencenordic.com|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norse immigrant graves in [[England]] and chemical analysis of the remains suggested a somewhat equal distribution of men and women, suggesting husbands and wives, while some of the women were buried with weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Warriors and women: the sex ratio of Norse migrants to eastern England up to 900 AD | last = McLeod | first = Shane | work = Early Medieval Europe | publisher = Wiley | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 332–353 | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0254.2011.00323.x/full | doi=10.1111/j.1468-0254.2011.00323.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Invasion of the Viking women unearthed | url = http://content.usatoday.com/communities/sciencefair/post/2011/07/invasion-of-the-viking-women-unearthed/1?csp=34news#.U6xrxBwcqs8 | date = July 19, 2011 | publisher = [[USA Today]] | last = Vergano | first = Dan}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a tie-in special to the TV series ''[[Vikings (2013 TV series)|Vikings]]'' Neil Price showed that a 10th Century [[Birka]]-burial excavated in the 1970s containing a large number of weapons and the bones of two horses turned out to be the grave of a woman upon bone analysis by Anna Kjellström.&lt;ref name="history.com"/&gt; In 2017, DNA analysis confirmed that the person was female&lt;ref name=jonson2017&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/ajpa.23308|title=A female Viking warrior confirmed by genomics|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|year=2017|last1=Hedenstierna-Jonson|first1=Charlotte|last2=Kjellström|first2=Anna|last3=Zachrisson|first3=Torun|last4=Krzewińska|first4=Maja|last5=Sobrado|first5=Veronica|last6=Price|first6=Neil|last7=Günther|first7=Torsten|last8=Jakobsson|first8=Mattias|last9=Götherström|first9=Anders|last10=Storå|first10=Jan}}&lt;/ref&gt;; the so called [[Birka female Viking warrior]], but others including respected scholar of the Vikings, Judith Jesch says that conclusion is premature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/14/world/europe/sweden-viking-women-warriors-dna.html|title=A Female Viking Warrior?

==In popular culture==
While women warriors are a staple of [[fantasy]], they are not often referred to as shield-maidens. Some who are include [[Éowyn]] in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and Thorgil in [[Nancy Farmer]]'s ''[[The Sea of Trolls]]'' trilogy.

In the 2013 TV series ''[[Vikings (2013 TV series)|Vikings]]'', the legendary Viking shield-maiden [[Lagertha]], played by [[Katheryn Winnick]], is a principal character.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1423">'''Simhika''', or '''Sinhika''', was the daughter of Demon king [[Hiranyakashipu]] and was the sister of the [[Vishnu]] devotee Bhakt [[Prahlada]]. She is also considered as the mother of [[Svarbhānu]], who was beheaded into two by Lord Vishnu into [[Rahu]], the head part and [[Ketu (mythology)|Ketu]], the remaining body.

==Simhika in Ramayana and her death==
Simhika got the boon from [[Brahma]] that she can control anyone's shadow. Later, she controlled Devi [[Chhaya]], mother of Lord [[Shani]] and wife of [[Surya]], the sun god. And eventually got defeated by Shani and [[Hanuman]]. Simhika was forgiven by monkey god, Hanuman, but Hanuman told her that whenever he finds her in later phase of life he'll kill her. Later, when Hanuman was climbing the ocean to [[Lanka]], the kingdom of Demon [[Ravana]], Simhika was hiding in the ocean and captured Hanuman's shadow, Hanuman jumped into her mouth and came out tearing her stomach, ending the life of Simhika.

[[File:Soslan.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Dancing Soslan, [[Vladikavkaz]]]]
[[File:Sosruko DSC06305.JPG|thumb|Sosruko tower in [[Nalchik]]]]
'''Sosruko''' or '''Sosriqwa''' ({{lang-os|Сослан}}, ''Soslan''; {{lang-kbd|Сосрыкъуэ}}, ''Sosryqwa''; {{lang-krc|Сосурукъ/Сосуркъа}}, ''Sosuruq/Sosurqa'') is a central character in many cycles of the [[Nart sagas]] of the [[Caucasus]].

Sosruko is a powerful but devious man who is the smallest of the Narts; as a character, he is sometimes cast in the light of the [[trickster]] god, comparable to the [[Scandinavia]]n [[Loki]] (who finds a closer parallel in the Nart [[Syrdon]] however), [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] [[Amirani]], or the [[Ancient Greek]] [[Prometheus]]. It is possible that at least in the latter case, Sosruku served as a direct inspiration.

In Circassian mythology, it was Nart Sosriqwe, minion of the gods and his doting mother, Lady [[Satanaya]], who stole fire from the giant.

== Etymology ==
The name etymologically came from Turkic languages: [[Nogai language|Nogai]] ''suslan-'' "to look menacing", ''suslä'' "menacing, gloomy" (hence {{lang-os|Soslan}}). The variants {{lang-ab|Sasərqwa}}, {{lang-ady|Саусырыкъо}} [{{ipa|saːwsərəqʷa}}], {{lang-kbd|Сосрыкъуэ}} [{{ipa|sawsərəqʷa}}], [[Ubykh language|Ubykh]]: [{{ipa|sawsərəqʷa}}], [[Digor dialect|Digor]] {{lang-os|Sosruqo, Sozyryqo, Sozuruqo}}.
The name Sosruko [{{ipa|saːwsərəqʷa}}] is from [[Circassian language|Circassian]] {{ipa|sa}} "sword" + {{ipa|wa}} "hit" + {{ipa|sər}} "heat" + {{ipa|qʷa}} "son"; hence literally “The son of the fiery sword hit”.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10471">The '''Splat Pack''' is a collection of [[independent filmmakers]] who, since 2002, have directed, written and produced numerous R-rated [[horror film]]s, notable for their [[Low-budget film|low budgets]] and extreme ultra-violence.&lt;ref name="the splat pack"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Splat Pack |first=Rebecca |last=Winters Keegan |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1549299,00.html |newspaper= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date= October 22, 2006|accessdate=January 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term was coined by [[Alan Jones (film critic)|Alan Jones]] of ''[[Total Film]]''.&lt;ref name="blood brothers"&gt;{{cite news |title=Blood Brothers  |first=Alan |last=Jones |authorlink=Alan Jones (film critic) |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117956275.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1&amp;s=h&amp;p=0 |newspaper=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=December 24, 2006 |accessdate=January 7, 2011}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The group has been credited with bringing back ultra-violent movies, as well as moving away from [[MPAA film rating system|PG-13]] rated movies and into the [[MPAA film rating system|R-rated]] spectrum, all while operating with [[independent film|low budgets]].&lt;ref name="the splat pack"/&gt;&lt;ref name="horrors"&gt;''New York Post''; October 22, 2006.

==The Cavite Conspiracy==
Shortly before the [[Katipunan]] was uncovered, [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] was planning to attack the Spanish arsenal at [[Fort San Felipe (Cavite)|Fort San Felipe]] and he enlisted other Katipuneros to recruit enough men so they could overrun the Spanish garrison. Their meetings were held at the house of Cabuco.

Aguinaldo and the other Katipuneros agreed that they would arm the inmates of the provincial jail who were made to work at the garrison. The task of recruiting the inmates was given to Lapidario, who was also the warden of the provincial jail. Aguado was to supply Lapidario with money to buy arms.

According to their plan, the uprising would be signalled by fireworks from the warehouse of Inocencio. Other leaders of the uprising were Luciano, Conchu, Pérez, Pablo José, Marcos José, and Juan Castañeda.  The revolt was to start on September 1.

On August 26, Aguinaldo received a letter from [[Andrés Bonifacio]] who reported that a Katipunan assembly in Balintawak on August 24 decided to start the revolution on August 30, to be signalled by a blackout at the Luneta, then known as Bagumbayan. On the appointed day, Bonifacio and his men attacked the Spanish powder magazine in San Juan. Later that same day, the Spanish authorities declared martial law in [[Manila]] and the provinces of [[Cavite]], [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]], [[Batangas]], [[Bulacan]], [[Pampanga]], [[Tarlac]] and [[Nueva Ecija]].

Aguinaldo learned of the declaration of martial law in a meeting with Spanish Governor Fernando Pargas on the morning of August 31, 1896. He then went to Cabezas' haberdashery and ask him to inform to Lapidario that they had alternative but to rise in arms. Cabezas was the one who enlisted Lapidario for the planned uprising.

But Cabezas was not in favor of starting the revolt on August 31, 1896 so they discussed the uprising further. They decided to postpone the attack to September 3. However, the Spanish learned of the plan from a dressmaker named Victoriana Sayat and they immediately arrested Lapidario, de Ocampo and Aguado. The three were held incommunicado in the boat ''Ulloa'' and interrogated. They are presumed to have been tortured.

[[File:Trece Martires Monument.jpg|thumb|280px|The Thirteen Martyrs Monument in San Roque]]
De Ocampo revealed the names of his companions and the thirteen suspects were rounded up on September 3 along with dozens of other Cavite leaders, including the musician [[Julián Felipe]], who would compose the Philippine national anthem the following year. Felipe was incarcerated for nine months at Fort San Felipe. Also subsequently released were Pablo and Marcos José, and Juan Castañeda of Imus, who are also believed to have been involved in the uprising.

While awaiting trial, guilt-stricken de Ocampo tried to commit suicide by slashing his stomach with a piece of broken glass. However, he was included in the indictment for treason before a military court which found them guilty on September 11 after a four-hour trial.

At 12:45&amp;nbsp;p.m. the following day, the thirteen patriots were brought out of their cells and taken to the Plaza de Armas, outside Fort San Felipe, and executed by musketry. Their bodies were later buried in a common grave at the Catholic cemetery at the village of Caridad.

Later, the bodies of seven of the martyrs—Máximo Inocencio, Victorino Luciano, Francisco Osorio, Luis Aguado, Hugo Pérez, José Lallana, and Antonio San Agustín—were exhumed and reburied elsewhere. But the rest—Agapito Conchu, Máximo Gregorio, Alfonso de Ocampo, Eugenio Cabezas, Feliciano Cabuco, and Severino Lapidario remained unclaimed in their common grave.

In 1906, a monument to the Thirteen Martyrs was erected at the San Roque district of Cavite City, at the head of then San Roque causeway. Their families reinterred the remains of their loved ones at the foot of the monument.  The monument is located at the intersection of M. Valentin St., Lopez Jaena Rd, Zulueta Rd and the P. Burgos Ave.

== Legacy ==
In 1954, the capital of Cavite was transferred to a newly created city situated near the center of the province, and it was named ''[[Trece Mártires]]'' in their honor. Each of its 13 [[barangay]]s were named for each of the martyrs. On May 24, 2004, a new monument of the thirteen patriots were inaugurated in Trece Martires near the City Hall.

[[File:Bad guy riff.png|thumb|Theme from ''[[Mysterioso Pizzicato]]'', a [[cliché]] silent movie cue for villainy {{audio|Mysterioso Pizzicato.mid|Play}}]]

A '''villain''' (also known as, "'''baddie'''", "'''bad guy'''", "'''evil guy'''", "'''heavy'''" or "'''black hat'''") is an "[[evil]]" character in a story, whether a [[history|historical]] narrative or, especially, a work of [[fiction]]. 

The villain is a [[antagonist]] (though can be the [[protagonist]]){{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} who tends to have a negative effect on other characters. A female villain is occasionally called a '''villainess'''. Random House Unabridged Dictionary defines villain as "a cruelly malicious person who is involved in or devoted to wickedness or crime; scoundrel; or a character in a play, novel, or the like, who constitutes an important evil agency in the plot".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=villain |url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/villain |website=[[Dictionary.com]] |publisher=[[Wayback Machine]] |accessdate=October 11, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140402110610/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/villain |archivedate=2014-04-02 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[Image:Villains before going to Work receiving their Lord's Orders Miniature in the Proprietaire des Choses Manuscript of the Fifteenth Century Library of the Arsenal in Paris.png|thumb|French villeins in the 15th century before going to work, receiving their Lord's Orders.]]

Villain comes from the [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-French]] and [[Old French]] ''vilain'', which itself descends from the [[Late Latin]] word '' villanus'', meaning "farmhand",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Robert K. Barnhart |author2=Sol Steinmetz |title=Chambers Dictionary of Etymology |date=1999 |publisher=Chambers |location=New York |isbn=0550142304 |page=1204}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the sense of someone who is bound to the soil of a ''villa'', which is to say, worked on the equivalent of a [[plantation]] in [[Late Antiquity]], in Italy or [[Gaul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=David B. Guralnik |title=[[Webster's New World Dictionary]] |date=1984 |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |location=New York |isbn=0671418149 |edition=2nd college}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2018}} The same etymology produced [[villein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=villain |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/villain |website=[[OxfordDictionaries.com|Oxford Dictionaries]] |accessdate=October 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It referred to a person of less than knightly status and so came to mean a person who was not [[Chivalry|chivalrous]] and [[Politeness|polite]]. As a result of many unchivalrous and evil acts, such as [[betrayal|treachery]] or rape, being considered villainous in the modern sense of the word, it became used as a term of abuse and eventually took on its modern meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=[[C. S. Lewis]] |title=Studies in Words |date=2013 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=9781107688650 |pages=120-121 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xONwBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA120 |accessdate=October 11, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Germanic word "[[churl]]", originally meaning "a non-servile peasant" and denoting the lowest rank of freemen in Saxon society, had gone through a similar degradation, as did the word "[[wikt:boor#Noun|boor]]" which originally meant "farmer".

==Folk and fairy tales==
[[Vladimir Propp]], in his analysis of Russian fairy tales, concluded that a [[fairy tale]] had only eight ''[[dramatis personae]]'', of which one was the villain,&lt;ref name="Propp"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Vladimir Propp |authorlink1=Vladimir Propp |title=Morphology of the Folk Tale |date=1968 |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=0292783760 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|79}} and his analysis has been widely applied to non-Russian tales. The actions that fell into a villain's sphere were:
* a story-initiating villainy, where the villain caused harm to the hero or his family 
* a conflict between the hero and the villain, either a fight or other competition
* pursuing the hero after he has succeeded in winning the fight or obtaining something from the villain

None of these acts necessarily occurs in a fairy tale, but when any of them do, the character that performs the act is the villain. The villain, therefore, could appear twice: once in the opening of the story, and a second time as the person sought out by the hero.&lt;ref name="Propp"/&gt;{{rp|84}}

When a character performed only these acts, the character was a pure villain. Various villains also perform other functions in a fairy tale; a witch who fought the hero and ran away, and who lets the hero follow her, is also performing the task of "guidance" and thus acting as a helper.&lt;ref name="Propp"/&gt;{{rp|81}}

The functions could also be spread out among several characters. If a dragon acted as the villain but was killed by the hero, another character (such as the dragon's sisters) might take on the role of the villain and pursue the hero.&lt;ref name="Propp"/&gt;{{rp|81}}

Two other characters could appear in roles that are villainous in the more general sense. One is the [[false hero]]: this character is always villainous, presenting a false claim to be the hero that must be rebutted for the happy ending.&lt;ref name="Propp"/&gt;{{rp|60}} Among these characters are [[Cinderella]]'s stepsisters, chopping off parts of their feet to fit on the shoe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Maria Tatar |authorlink1=Maria Tatar |title=The Annotated Brothers Grimm |date=2004 |publisher=[[W. W. Norton &amp; Company|W.W. Norton]] |isbn=0393058484 |page=136 |edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another character, the dispatcher, sends a hero on his quest. This might be an innocent request, to fulfill a legitimate need, but the dispatcher might also, villainously, lie to send a character on a quest in hopes of being rid of him.&lt;ref name="Propp"/&gt;{{rp|77}}

==Villainous foil==
[[File:Wicked Witch of the West W.W. Denslow.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Wicked Witch of the West]] from ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' is an example of a literary villain.]]

In fiction, villains commonly function in the dual role of adversary and [[Foil (literature)|foil]] to the story's heroes. In their role as an adversary, the villain serves as an obstacle the hero must struggle to overcome. In their role as a foil, the villain exemplifies characteristics that are diametrically opposed to those of the hero, creating a contrast distinguishing heroic traits from villainous ones.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Others point out that many acts of villains have a hint of wish-fulfillment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Das |first1=Sisir Kumar |title=A History of Indian Literature: 1911-1956 |date=1995 |publisher=[[Sahitya Akademi]] |isbn=9788172017989 |page=416 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sqBjpV9OzcsC&amp;pg=PA416 |accessdate=October 11, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; which makes some people identify with them as characters more strongly than with the heroes. Because of this, a convincing villain must be given a [[characterization]] that provides a [[Base motive|motive]] for doing wrong, as well as being a worthy adversary to the hero. As put by film critic [[Roger Ebert]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Each film is only as good as its villain. Since the heroes and the gimmicks tend to repeat from film to film, only a great villain can transform a good try into a triumph."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Roger Ebert |authorlink1=Roger Ebert |title=Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan Movie Review (1982) |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/star-trek-ii-the-wrath-of-khan-1982 |website=RogerEbert.com |accessdate=October 11, 2018 |language=en |date=January 1, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Portraying and employing villains in fiction==
[[Tod Slaughter]] always portrayed villainous characters on both stage and screen in a melodramatic manner, with mustache-twirling, eye-rolling, leering, [[evil laughter|cackling]], and [[hand-rubbing]] (however, this often failed to translate well from stage to screen).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bryan Senn |title=Golden Horrors: An Illustrated Critical Filmography of Terror Cinema, 1931-1939 |date=1996 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=9780786401758 |page=481}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Jeffery Richards |title=The Unknown 1930s: An Alternative History of the British Cinema, 1929-39 |date=2001 |publisher=[[I.B. Tauris]] |isbn=9781860646287 |page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brad Warner]] states that "only cartoon villains cackle with glee while rubbing their hands together and dream of ruling the world in the name of all that is wicked and bad".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=[[Brad Warner]] |title=Sit Down and Shut Up: Punk Rock Commentaries on Buddha, God, Truth, Sex, Death, and Dogen's Treasury of the Right Dharma Eye |date=2007 |publisher=New World Library |isbn=9781577315599 |page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ben Bova]] recommends to authors that their works not contain villains. He states, in his ''Tips for writers'': &lt;blockquote&gt;"In the real world there are no villains. No one actually sets out to do evil... Fiction mirrors life. Or, more accurately, fiction serves as a lens to focus on what they know in life and bring its realities into sharper, clearer understanding for us. There are no villains cackling and rubbing their hands in glee as they contemplate their evil deeds. There are only people with problems, struggling to solve them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=[[Ben Bova]] |title=Tips for writers |url=http://benbova.com/tips2.html |website=Ben Bova |accessdate=2008-12-05 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821135403/http://benbova.com/tips2.html |archivedate=2009-08-21 |date=2008-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; [[David Lubar]] adds: &lt;blockquote&gt;"This is a brilliant observation that has served me well in all my writing. (The bad guy isn't doing bad stuff so he can rub his hands together and snarl.) He may be driven by greed, neuroses, or the conviction that his cause is just, but he's driven by something, not unlike the things that drive a hero."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Darcy Pattinson |title=Villains Don't Always Wear Black |url=http://www.darcypattison.com/characters/villains-dont-always-wear-black/ |website=Fiction Notes |accessdate=2018-10-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122183445/http://www.darcypattison.com/characters/villains-dont-always-wear-black/ |archivedate=2009-01-22 |date=2008-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|sure=yes|reason=Source is a blog.|date=October 2018}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Sympathetic villain===
In an attempt to add realism to their stories, many writers will try to create "sympathetic" villains, the [[antithesis]] to an [[antihero]] called an '''anti-villain'''. These villains come in just as many shapes and sizes as anti-heroes do. Some may wish to make the world a better place but go to antagonistic lengths to do so (such as [[Doctor Octopus]] in ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'', who commits various crimes in an attempt to complete his goal of creating a cheap, renewable source of energy, and Dr. Horrible in ''[[Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog]]'', who wants to rule the world so that he can solve all of its problems), or may employ a code of honor in fighting his enemies, even if it is to achieve antagonistic goals (examples include Murdock, a secondary villain in the game ''[[Fire Emblem: Fūin no Tsurugi]]'', who is honorable, but fights the player's army due to loyalty to his country). Other sympathetic villains may be pushed to antagonistic lifestyles by society's mistreatment of him due to prejudice against something he is a part of (such as [[racism]], as is the case in ''[[American History X]]''), but goes to absurd lengths to achieve the equality he desires, like [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] in the ''[[X-Men]]'' comics and films. Others may include those manipulated by malevolent and opprobrious forces (such as [[Jack Torrance]] being manipulated by the Overlook Hotel in ''[[The Shining (novel)|The Shining]]''). Plot based video games tend to have two villains where one is sympathetic. This creates a foreseeable plot twist wherein either they die or they switch sides.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13788">The '''Witches of Warboys''' were Alice Samuel and her family, who were accused of, and executed for [[witchcraft]] between 1589 and 1593 in the village of [[Warboys]], in the [[fens]] of England.&lt;ref name="The Most Strange and Admirable..."&gt;{{cite book|title=The Most Strange and Admirable Discouerie of the Three Witches of Warboys Arraigned, Conuicted, and Executed at the Last Assises at Huntington, for the Bewitching of the Fiue Daughters of Robert Throckmorton Esquire, and Other Persons (1593), Reprint|year=2010|publisher=BiblioBazaar}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of many [[witch trials in the early modern period]], but scholar Barbara Rosen claims it "attracted probably more notice than any other in the sixteenth century".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosen |first=Barbara |title=Witchcraft in England 1558–1618 |location=Amherst |publisher=University  of Massachusetts |year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The trials of the witches occurred during the sixteenth century at [[Warboys]] in Huntingdonshire. The first allegations were made in November 1589 by Jane Throckmorton, the 10-year-old daughter of Robert Throckmorton the [[Squire]] of Warboys when she started suffering from fits (see Initial Allegations below). She accused the 76-year-old Alice Samuel of being the cause; this was echoed by Jane’s four sisters and some household servants who began exhibiting similar symptoms. When Alice Samuel was brought forward to the children, they became more ill and had the urge to scratch her.{{citation needed|date=October 2016|reason=For all the information in the paragraph}}

Robert Throckmorton was a close friend of [[Henry Williams (alias Cromwell)|Sir Henry Cromwell]], one of the wealthiest commoners in England and the grandfather of [[Oliver Cromwell]].  In March 1590, Lady Cromwell came to Warboys to visit. At the Throckmorton house, she interviewed Alice Samuel and what came after the interview served to confirm the suspicions the Throckmortons had. Lady Cromwell was tormented by Alice Samuel in her dreams, and after some time she became ill and died (buried 1592). This was enough proof to put Alice Samuel through a trial that would find her and the rest of her family guilty.{{citation needed|date=October 2016|reason=For all the information in the paragraph}}

==Initial allegations==

===Throckmorton family===
The first allegations declaring Alice as a practitioner of witchcraft were made in November 1589.  Following this, there were a total of twelve maid-servants of the Throckmorton household (in addition to the five daughters) who experienced fits and the torment of Alice Samuell’s witchcraft. Jane’s fits were described as such: "Sometimes she would neese [sneeze] very loud and thick for the space of half an hour together; and evidently as one in a great trance and sound lay quietly as long, soon after would begin to swell and heave up her belly so as none was able to bend her or keep her down, sometime thee would shake one leg and no other part of her, as if the palsie had been in it, sometimes the other, presently she would shake one of her arms and then the other, and soon after her head, as if she had been infected with the running palsie".&lt;ref name="Anonymous 1593"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anonymous |title=The most strange and admirable discouerie of the three Witches of Warboys |location=London |year=1593}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jane's mother and grandmother were by the child’s side while other neighbors came to see her. When Alice Samuel came in, the child proclaimed: "Grandmother look where the old witch sitteth (pointing to Samuell) did you ever see one more like a witch than she is: Take off her black thrumbed [shaggy or fringed] cap, for I cannot abide to look on her". Jane's mother  thought nothing of this at first, thinking her child was sleep deprived and sick.  However, because Jane continued to get worse, her parents sent her urine to Doctor Barrow of Cambridge, who sent medicine to Jane three separate times thinking it would heal her.  It did not.  After the third time, the Doctor inquired whether there were any signs of sorcery or witchcraft involved that the parents could see. Jane’s urine was then sent to a family acquaintance, Master Butler, for examination and he sent back the same remedies that Doctor Barrow had sent. Exactly a month later, on the same day almost to the hour, two more of Master Throckmorton’s daughters fell sick to the same illness  that was afflicting Jane.&lt;ref name="Anonymous 1593"/&gt;

These daughters, two to three years older than Jane, cried out: "Take her away, look where she standeth here before us in a black thrumbed cap it is she that hath bewitched us and she will kill us if you do not take her away".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anonymous |title=The most strange and admirable discovery of the three Witches of Warboys |location=London |year=1593}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The parents were then worried, but could not understand why any such harm would come to them, for they had only moved into the town the "Michaelmas before" (September 29, 1588).{{citation needed|date=October 2016|reason=quotation}} Their youngest daughter, nine years old, fell sick less than a month later. Soon after this, the oldest daughter, fifteen years old, fell sick. She was sickest out of the five. Both cried out against Alice Samuell. Their eldest sister, having been the strongest, strived with the spirit, and was grievously tortured not being able to overcome it. This caused her to "(neefe), screech and groan very fearfully, sometimes it would heave up her belly and bounce up her body with such violence that she was not kept upon her bed".{{citation needed|date=October 2016|reason=quotation}}   When sitting in a chair, her fits often caused her to break that chair.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The daughters could not see, hear or feel while in these fits. They accused Mother Samuell, asking for her to be taken away. These fits would sometimes last for half a day and happened up to six or seven times a day.  They believed that God freed them of this [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]] and afterwards, the sisters remembered nothing of what they had been saying.{{citation needed|date=October 2016|reason=For all the information in the paragraph}}

===Lady Cromwell===
In March 1590, Lady Cromwell and Alice had a discussion regarding the accusations made against Alice.  During this conversation, Lady Cromwell reportedly grabbed a pair of [[scissors]] and cut a lock of hair off Alice, and gave it to Mrs. Throckmorton to burn (a [[folk tradition|folk]] remedy believed to weaken a witch's power). That night, Lady Cromwell had nightmares, became ill and later died in 1592.&lt;ref name="Luke Matin"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Matin |first1=Luke |title=The Witch Trials – Witches of Warboys Witch Trials |url=http://www.witchcraftandwitches.com/trials_warboys.html|publisher=Luke Matin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial==
Following the death of Lady Cromwell, a local parson convinced Alice to admit to witchcraft, which she retracted the very next day.  However, she confessed again when she was brought before the [[Bishop of Lincoln]], and taken to [[Huntingdon]] where she was imprisoned with her daughter and husband.  The family was tried in April 1593 for the murder by witchcraft of Lady Cromwell. Alice’s words to Lady Cromwell ("Madam, why do you use me thus? I never did you any harm as yet") were used against her at the trial, and all three were found guilty and eventually hanged.&lt;ref name="The Most Strange and Admirable..." /&gt;&lt;ref name="Luke Matin" /&gt;

==Posthumous proof==
The jailer and his wife examined the corpses.
{{quote|[H]e found upon the body of the old woman Alice Samuel a little lump of flesh, in manner sticking out as if it had been a teat, to the length of half an inch; which both he and his wife perceiving, at the first sight thereof meant not to disclose because it was adjoining so secret a place which was not decent to be seen. Yet in the end, not willing to conceal so strange a matter, and decently covering that privy place a little above which it grew, they made open show thereof unto diverse that stood by.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Witch in History: Early Modern and Twentieth-Century Representations |first=Diane |last=Purkiss |publisher=Routledge |year=2013|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Historian Jim Kermode argues that the discovery of a [[witches' mark]] (also known as a "devil's mark") was important legal proof at this period in England. "[I]t gradually became accepted that the mark, with women, most commonly took the form of a teat-like growth in the pudenda".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kermode |first=J.I. |last2=Walker |first2=Garthine |title=Women, crime and the courts in early modern England |date=1994 |publisher=UCL Press |location=London |isbn=1857281403}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This tale of the jailer's postmortem examination has been widely quoted in modern scholarship, for example with reference to the animal/human divide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Creager |editor-first=Angela N.H. |last=Jordan|first=William Chester |title=The animal-human boundary: historical perspectives |date=2002 |publisher=University of Rochester Press |location=Rochester, N.Y |isbn=9781580461207 |page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; the "sado-erotic fascination of the witches' teat",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Words like daggers: violent female speech in early modern England |date=2015 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |location=[S.l.] |isbn=978-0-8032-5488-6 |page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; and particularly in [[feminist interpretations of the Early Modern witch trials]]. It is also cited by writers such as [[Lynn Picknett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Picknett |first1=Lynn |title=The secret history of Lucifer: the ancient path to knowledge and the real Da Vinci code |date=2005 |publisher=Robinson |location=London |isbn=978-1845292638 |edition=Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The scholar [[George Lyman Kittredge|George Kittredge]] (1860–1941) called the Warboys trial "the most momentous witch-trial that had ever occurred in England", partially because it had "demonstrably produced a deep and lasting impression on the class that made laws". He makes a case that the Warboys trial influenced the passage of the [[Witchcraft Acts#Witchcraft Act 1604|Witchcraft Act of 1604]].

Following the hangings, Robert Throckmorton left Warboys hastily, his wife allegedly dying shortly before his departure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=DeWindt |first=Anne |title=Witchcraft and Conflicting Visions of the Ideal Village Community |journal=Journal of British Studies |volume=34 |year=1995 |pages=427–463}} JSTOR.

'''Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker''' (abbreviated to '''ZAZ''') were an American comedy filmmaking trio consisting of [[Jim Abrahams]] and brothers [[David Zucker (filmmaker)|David Zucker]] and [[Jerry Zucker (film director)|Jerry Zucker]] who specialized in writing [[slapstick comedy]] films during the 1980s. The trio knew each other during their childhood years, growing up in [[Shorewood, Wisconsin]] and attending [[Shorewood High School (Wisconsin)|Shorewood High School]] which is sometimes referenced in their work. While attending the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], the trio founded a small theater known as The Kentucky Fried Theater in 1971 which led to their [[sketch comedy]] film ''[[The Kentucky Fried Movie]]''.

This was followed in 1980 by the trio's breakout hit ''[[Airplane!]]'', which remains a revered comedic milestone. Subsequent collaborations include the TV series ''[[Police Squad!]]'', its subsequent ''[[The Naked Gun|Naked Gun]]'' trilogy and the films ''[[Top Secret!]]'' and ''[[Ruthless People]]''. All of their projects relied heavily on [[Parody|parodies]], [[visual gag]]s and [[Fourth wall|breaking of the fourth wall]], and established a strong cult following. The notable stylistic exception is ''Ruthless People'', a more traditional farce that was directed by the trio but unlike their other productions, not written by them.

Prominent ZAZ actors and actresses include [[Leslie Nielsen]], [[Lloyd Bridges]], [[Robert Stack]], [[Rowan Atkinson]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]] and [[Charlie Sheen]]. The trio's status as a three-person team of co-directors is highly unusual, although some of their later projects were directed by David Zucker working solo and with Jerry Zucker and Abrahams credited only as producers and/or writers. Each member of the group also had individual solo careers:

* David Zucker directed ''[[BASEketball]]'', ''[[My Boss's Daughter]]'', ''[[Scary Movie 3]]'' and ''[[Scary Movie 4|4]]''.
* Abrahams directed ''[[Hot Shots!]]'' and ''[[Mafia!|Jane Austen's Mafia!]]''.
* Jerry Zucker directed ''[[Ghost (1990 film)|Ghost]]'', ''[[First Knight]]'' and ''[[Rat Race (film)|Rat Race]]''. Of the three, Jerry Zucker has found the most mainstream non-comedic success including ''Ghost'' and ''First Knight'', which grossed $505 million and $127 million worldwide respectively.

==Filmography==
&lt;!--Do NOT add Police Squad! It's a TV show, not an actual film. Also do NOT add the Naked Gun movies. They were not directed by ZAZ, only written. Thank you.!--&gt;
