'''Alice Salomon''' (19 April 1872, [[Berlin]] – 30 August 1948, [[New York City|New York]]) was a German social reformer and pioneer of [[social work]] as an academic discipline.  Her role was so important to German social work that a postage stamp (pictured) was issued 1989 by [[Deutsche Bundespost]] in her memory.  A university, a park and a square in Berlin are all named after her.

==Life and career==
Alice Salomon was the third of eight children, and the second daughter, of Albert and Anna Salomon.  Like many girls from affluent families in this period, she was denied further education, despite her ambition to become a teacher.  This ended in 1893 when she was 21, and she recorded in her autobiography that this was "when her life began".

In 1900 she joined the ''Bund Deutscher Frauenvereine'' ("Federation of German Women's Associations" - BDF hereinafter).  In due course she was elected deputy chairperson, and kept this role until 1920.  (The Chairperson was [[Gertrud Bäumer]]).  The organisation supported destitute, abandoned, or single mothers and aimed to prevent their children being neglected.

From 1902 to 1906 she studied economics at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich Wilhelm University]] in Berlin, though she had no relevant qualification.  Her publications were sufficient for university entrance.  She earned her doctorate in 1908 with a dissertation entitled ''Die Ursachen der ungleichen Entlohnung von Männer- und Frauenarbeit'' (loosely, "Causes of Pay Inequality Between Men and Women").  Also in this year she founded a ''Soziale Frauenschule'' ("Social Women's School") in Berlin, which was renamed "Alice Salomon School" in 1932 and is now called ''Alice-Salomon-Fachhochschule für Sozialarbeit und Sozialpädagogik Berlin'' ("Alice Salomon College of Further Education for Social Work and Social Sciences of Berlin").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stadtteilzeitung-schoeneberg.de/2008/oktober/1htm 100 Jahrfeier]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909 she became secretary of the ''Internationalen Frauenbund'' (International Council of Women).  She converted from [[Judaism]] to the [[Lutheran Church]] in 1914.  In 1917 she was made chairperson of the ''Konferenz sozialer Frauenschulen Deutschlands'' ("Conference of German Women's Social Schools") that she herself had founded; by 1919 sixteen schools belonged to it.

In 1920 she resigned from the BDF from fear of [[History of the Jews in Germany#Freedom and repression (1815–1930s)|antisemitic]] propaganda.  Five years later, she founded the ''Deutsche Akademie für soziale und pädagogische Frauenarbeit'' ("German Academy for Women's Social and Educational Work") which was directed by [[Hilde Lion]].  Speakers at this institution included [[Albert Einstein]], [[Carl Gustav Jung]], [[Helene Weber]] and others of similar eminence.

In the late 1920s and early 1930s, this organisation published thirteen monographs on the social and economic conditions faced by the poor in Germany.  For Alice Salomon's 60th birthday, she received an honorary doctorate from Berlin University and the Silver State Medal from the Prussian State Ministry.

===Treatment by the Nazis===
[[File:Alice Salomon, deprivation of german citizenship.jpg|thumb|Document of her deprivation of german citizenship from 25 january 1939]]

In 1933 when they acceded to power, the [[Nazi]] party [[Anti-Jewish legislation in prewar Nazi Germany|stripped her of all her offices]] and six years later, when she was 65, she faced interrogation by the [[Gestapo]].  The Nazis objected to Salomon's Jewish origins, her Christian humanist ideas, her pacifism and international reputation.  She was expelled from Germany, where she had been running a relief committee for Jewish emigrants.

She went to New York, her German citizenship and her two doctorates having been taken from her.  In 1944 she became an American citizen.  A year later, she was honorary President of the International Women's Federation and the International Association of Schools of Social Work.

She died in New York.

'''Annette Susannah Beveridge (née Akroyd)''' (1842–1929) was a British [[Oriental studies|Orientalist]] known for her translation of the ''[[Humayun|Humayun-nama]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Begam Gulbadam|author2=Annette S. Beveridge|title=The history of Humayun = Humayun-nama|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N0WSBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA249&amp;dq=turki+woman+married+to&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwCDgeahUKEwimmrPm0MjIAhUFez4KHXm5AqA#v=onepage&amp;q=turki%20woman%20married%20to&amp;f=false|publisher=Begam Gulbadam|pages=249–|id=GGKEY:NDSD0TGDPA1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Babur-nama]]''.&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=53954|title=Beveridge [née Akroyd], Annette Susannah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and education==
Annette Akroyd's father William Akroyd was a [[General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches|Unitarian]] industrialist associated with the establishment of the [[Bedford College, London]] in 1849, where she completed her study in 1863.&lt;ref name="Kopf1979"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kopf|first=David|authorlink=David Kopf|title=The Brahmo Samaj and the Shaping of the Modern Indian Mind|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IUcY_IRKDHQC&amp;pg=PA37|year=1979|publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Distributors|isbn=978-0-691-03125-5|pages=34–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work in India==
[[File:Annette Akroyd.jpg|thumb|Annette Akroyd with the students of Hindu Mahila Vidyalaya, 1875.]]
In October 1872 she sailed for [[British India]]. Around 1875 she was involved in a public controversy with [[Keshub Chandra Sen]], an Indian philosopher and social reformer who attempted to incorporate Christian theology within the framework of Hindu thought. Akroyd was shocked by her discussions with him and felt that Sen, who spoke up for women's education in England, was a typical Hindu obscurantist back home in India, trying to keep knowledge from the minds of women.&lt;ref&gt;David Kopf pg. 34-40&lt;/ref&gt; This dispute spilled into the native press and had its impact on the [[Bethune College|Bethune School]]. Akroyd was also dismayed with Sen's associates such as [[Bijoy Krishna Goswami]], [[Aghore Nath Gupta]] and [[Gour Govinda Ray]], who were traditionally Hindu in educational background and resisted the education of women.

:"Mr. Sen had a strong prejudice against university education, in fact, against what is generally regarded as high education, of women. He objected to teaching them, for instance, such subjects as Mathematics, Philosophy and Science, whereas the advanced party positively wanted to give their daughters and sisters what is generally regarded as high education. They did not object to their university education and were not disposed to make much difference in point of education between men and women. There was no hope of compromise between two such extreme schools of thought, Accordingly, the radical party proceeded to start a separate female school of their own, called the [[Hindu Mahila Vidyalaya]] for the education of the adult young ladies belonging to their party. The successful manner in which they carried on the work of this school under Miss Akroyd, subsequently Mrs. Beveridge, attracted much public notice and was highly praised by the officers of Government. This school did excellent work for many years and was subsequently conducted under the name of the [[Banga Mahila Vidyalaya]] and was at last amalgamated with the [[Bethune College]] for ladies, to which it furnished some of its most distinguished students."&lt;ref&gt;"History of the Brahmo Samaj" Sastri:1911:p.258&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translation==
Annette Beveridge translated the diaries of the first [[Mughal Empire|Mughal Emperor]] [[Babur]], the [[Baburnama]], publishing it in four books from 1912 to 1922. She used both Persian and Turki sources.&lt;ref name="Beveridge3"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Babur|editor1-last=Beveridge|editor1-first=Annette Susannah|title=The Babur-nama in English (Memoirs of Babur) - Volume I|date=1922|publisher=Luzac and Co. |location=London|url=https://archive.org/details/baburnamainengli01babuuoft|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beveridge4"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Babur|editor1-last=Beveridge|editor1-first=Annette Susannah|title=The Babur-nama in English (Memoirs of Babur) - Volume II|date=1922|publisher=Luzac and Co. |location=London|url=https://archive.org/details/baburnamainengli02babuuoft|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She also translated the biography of the second [[Mughal Empire|Mughal Emperor]], [[Humayun]], from Persian into English. The memoir had been written by his sister [[Gulbadan Begum]], whom Beveridge affectionately called "Princess Rosebud".&lt;ref name="Beveridge"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beveridge|first1=Annette Susannah|title=Life and writings of Gulbadan Begam (Lady Rosebody)|date=1898|location=Calcutta|url=https://archive.org/details/lifewritingsofgu00beve|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beveridge2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Begam|first1=Gulbaden|editor1-last=Beveridge|editor1-first=Annette Susannah|title=The history of Humāyūn (Humāyūn-nāma)|date=1902|publisher=Royal Asiatic Society|location=London|url=https://archive.org/details/historyhumynhum00bevegoog|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her other translated works include ''The key of the hearts of beginners'', 1908.

==Marriage and children==
She married [[Henry Beveridge]] of the [[Indian Civil Service]].&lt;ref name="MacMillan2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Margaret MacMillan|title=Women of the Raj: The Mothers, Wives, and Daughters of the Bristish Empire in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5Xh4m4Ljrn4C&amp;pg=PA245&amp;dq=turki+woman+married+to&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CFwQ6AEwCTgeahUKEwimmrPm0MjIAhUFez4KHXm5AqA#v=onepage&amp;q=turki%20woman%20married%20to&amp;f=false|year=2007|publisher=Random House Trade Paperbacks|isbn=978-0-8129-7639-7|pages=245–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The couple had two children: a daughter, Annette Jeanie Beveridge (d. 1956), who married [[R. H. Tawney]],&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 2 "Courtship and marriage", of ''The Life of R. H. Tawney: Socialism and History''  By Lawrence Goldman&lt;/ref&gt; and a son, [[William Beveridge]] (1879–1963), a noted economist who gave his name to [[Beveridge report|the report]] associated with the foundation of the [[welfare state]].&lt;ref name=pe/&gt;

The Beveridges lived at Pitfold, [[Shottermill]], [[Surrey]], England.&lt;ref name=pe&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p14226.htm#i142259|title=Henry Beveridge  Genealogy|accessdate=6 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:CPAS building.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Centre for the Public Awareness of Science at the Australian National University in Canberra]]
The '''Centre for the Public Awareness of Science''' is part of the [[Australian National University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpas.anu.edu.au Centre for the Public Awareness of Science]&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2000 it became an accredited Centre for the Australian National Commission for [[UNESCO]].

==Work of the Centre==

As a [[UNESCO]] Centre, CPAS engages with [[science communication]] and communicators in the Pacific region and beyond.  In partnership with the [[UNESCO]] Pacific Office in [[Apia]], [[Samoa]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=36986&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html UNESCO Pacific Office in Apia, Samoa]&lt;/ref&gt; CPAS has focused on science teaching training and communication in Pacific nations.  As well as running a science journalism workshop for [[Pacific Island]] journalists in 2001, CPAS  followed up in the same year with a science teacher workshop and the first Pacific Science Communication Forum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpas.anu.edu.au Pacific Science Communication Forum]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[UNESCO]] office in [[Jakarta]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.or.id UNESCO Office in Jakarta, Indonesia]&lt;/ref&gt; invited CPAS to join a mission to [[Cambodia]] to conduct a survey to identify and assess the needs of the country with respect to science education in schools and universities. Other activities include joining with [[UNESCO]] ([[Apia]]) to help in its aims to raise social participation in science in and around the Pacific.

CPAS also established, as a pilot project, the Register of Pacific Scientists, an online database for those involved with Pacific Science to record their details and/or search for other people with similar or complementary interests. 

Other activities of CPAS include the presentation of workshops for secondary school science teachers and others in [[Fiji]], [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Thailand]], [[Japan]] and [[New Zealand]]. A joint teaching program is being developed with the [[National University of Singapore]]. In [[South Africa]], CPAS helped to develop a touring hands-on science exhibition and has been invited to work in and with various [[South African]] science centres.

==Teaching, Outreach and Research==

With a flourishing graduate program, CPAS encourages research in all aspects of [[science communication]]. Degrees are offered at all tertiary levels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpas-dev.anu.edu.au/academic/index.php CPAS Academic Programs] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706113805/http://cpas-dev.anu.edu.au/academic/index.php |date=July 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Outreach programs within Australia include workshops for research scientists, science teachers, science and engineering students and science centre personnel, as well as the ANU Shell [[Questacon]] Science Circus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.questacon.edu.au/html/sqsc.html ANU Shell Questacon Science Circus]&lt;/ref&gt; 

CPAS has a wide research program dealing with issues at the interface of science and the public. Apart from a long-standing agenda of research in science centres, CPAS is concerned with current issues in science, with the communication agendas of scientists, and with effective communication of science concepts. The research program is interdisciplinary and contributes to the emerging framework of [[science communication]] theory.

==History==

CPAS was launched by Professor [[Richard Dawkins]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpas-dev.anu.edu.au/about/CPAS_launch.php CPAS Launch]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It owes it origin to the establishment, twenty years earlier, of a modest science centre in a vacant primary school in [[Canberra]]. This burgeoning science centre eventually grew into [[Questacon]] – The National Science and Technology Centre. [[Questacon]] was the brainchild of [[Mike Gore (physicist)|Michael Gore]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpas.anu.edu.au/staff/index.php#Mike Prof. Michael Gore] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718222852/http://cpas.anu.edu.au/staff/index.php#Mike |date=July 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a senior lecturer in Physics at the Australian National University, who became its first director. An important part of its activities was outreach, supported from the beginning by sponsorship from [[Shell Australia]].

Dr Gore approached Professor Chris Bryant,&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpas.anu.edu.au/staff/index.php#Chris Prof. Chris Bryant] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718222852/http://cpas.anu.edu.au/staff/index.php#Chris |date=July 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; then Dean of Science at the [[Australian National University]], with a proposal to set up a science circus to travel Australia, to be staffed by graduate science students enrolled in a course of [[science communication]]. Thus was born the Graduate Certificate in Science Communication that rapidly metamorphosed into a Graduate Diploma.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpas.anu.edu.au/academic/Graduate_Diploma.php CPAS Graduate Diploma in Science Communication] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080629085932/http://cpas.anu.edu.au/academic/Graduate_Diploma.php |date=June 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This initiative proved extremely popular and it became clear that there was a hitherto undetected demand for such a course. Over the next few years, Masters and PhD courses were offered and science communication became a full-fledged graduate program.

By 1994, the demand was so great that the Faculty of Science at the [[Australian National University]] agreed to fund a Lectureship in [[Science Communication]]. This was the first in Australia and, possibly, the world. Dr [[Susan Stocklmayer]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpas.anu.edu.au/staff/index.php#Sue Dr Susan Stocklmayer] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718222852/http://cpas.anu.edu.au/staff/index.php#Sue |date=July 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was appointed to the position and immediately announced her intention of establishing a university centre for [[science communication]].  The Centre was established in 1996, with Professor Bryant as its first, interim, Director. Dr Stocklmayer took over the position in 1998, where she remains today.

==Awards==

In subsequent years, the work of CPAS has been recognised by a number of awards and honours: In 1999, CPAS, [[Shell Australia]] and [[Questacon]] jointly won the Business/Higher Education Round Table&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bhert.com/ Business/Higher Education Round Table]&lt;/ref&gt; Award. The citation commends CPAS as “a university centre whose brief is to empower Australians by encouraging in them the confidence of 'ownership' of modern science. It is intended to increase science awareness in the Australian community and to improve communication skills of scientists.”  In 2000, its standing was such that it was designated as the first UNESCO Centre for Science Communication.

In 2004, the triple partnership was awarded the Financial Review National Award for long term sponsorship, and in 2006 it won the Special Award for Excellence in the Prime Ministers Community Business Partnerships. The individual contributions of members of CPAS have also been widely recognised and they have received many personal accolades.

'''Clarissa Caldwell Lathrop''' (1847 – September 11, 1892) was an American social reformer and autobiographer.{{sfn|Davis|1989|p=151}} Her prominence came from her remarkable experience, being confined and unlawfully imprisoned in the [[Utica Lunatic Asylum]] for 26 months (October 1880 – December 1882),{{sfn|Wood|1994|p=75}} through a plot of a secret enemy to kill her. She eventually managed to communicate with [[James Bailey Silkman]], a lawyer who, like herself, was confined in the same asylum under similar circumstances. He succeeded in obtaining a [[writ]] of ''[[habeas corpus]]'', and Judge [[George G. Barnard]] of the [[New York Supreme Court]] pronounced Lathrop sane and unlawfully incarcerated.{{sfn|Logan|1912|p=598}}

After that time, she devoted her life to ameliorating the laws relating to lunacy.{{sfn|American Woman Suffrage Association|1892|p=170}} Lathrop felt she owed it to women to take her case before the [[New York State Legislature]], and demand reform in this direction, but she was unsuccessful in two efforts and found herself penniless and facing the need to support herself. After several efforts, she became a [[court stenographer]], and ten years after her release, wrote a book, the story of her own institutionalization, entitled ''[[A Secret Institution]].'' Published at her own expense,&lt;ref name="nytimes.com" /&gt; this book led to the formation of the Lunacy Law Reform League, in 1889, a national organization with headquarters in [[New York City]], of which Lathrop became the secretary and was the national organizer.{{sfn|Logan|1912|p=598}}

==Early years and education==
Clarissa Caldwell Lathrop was born in [[Rochester, New York]]. She was a daughter of Gen. William E. Lathrop, a Brigadier General of the National Guard. Lathrop’s father had met and married Lathrop’s mother, Jemima, at the age of 42 – Jemima was only 19.  Lathrop had been one of five children, but had lost her eldest brother to disease in 1865 and her second eldest brother moved to the southern part of the country to look for work.  Lathrop’s father passed away in 1877 leaving his wife, and his three daughters to open their home to board strangers for income.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Secret Institution|last=Lathrop|first=Clarissa Caldwell|publisher=Bryant Publishing Co.|year=1890|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=1–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She graduated from the Rochester Academy.

Lathrop also often traveled significant distances and visited friends around Rochester.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Secret Institution|last=Lathrop|first=Clarissa Caldwell|publisher=Bryant Publishing Co.|year=1890|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=Chapter II}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Teacher===
Lathrop became a teacher, which, owing to her father's failure in business, became a means of support to her family as well as to herself. She continued to teach successfully until her unlawful imprisonment in the Utica State Hospital (formerly known as the New York State Lunatic Asylum at Utica).{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=450}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nysasylum.com/utica/ushhist.htm|title=Utica State Hospital|website=nysasylum.com|access-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Utica Lunatic Asylum incarceration and release===
Lathrop feared that Miss Hamlo, a boarder in her mother's house, was poisoning her. Lathrop was obsessed with a Mr. Zell, a former lover who married another woman after Lathrop rejected him. After repenting her decision to reject Zell, Lathrop became convinced that Hamlo was in alliance with Zell's wife. After Lathrop began seeing Zell eveywhere, she believed he had divorced, and would now marry her if Lathrop survived Hamlo's poisonings.{{sfn|Wood|1994|p=75}} When Lathrop's life was saved on two occasions by friends, she took some of the [[Aconitine|aconite]]-poisoned tea to a chemist for analysis, as she sought reliable proof before making open charges against any one. At the instigation of a doctor who was in sympathy with the plot to incarcerate Lathrop, she went to Utica to consult Dr. [[John P. Gray (psychiatrist)|John P. Gray]], Superintendent of the State Lunatic Asylum in [[Utica, New York]]. Instead of seeing Grey, upon her arrival, she was incarcerated with the insane, without the commitment papers required by law, and kept a prisoner at the asylum for 26 months.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=450}}

She was sent to the asylum at the insistence of her mother and sisters, who lived in Rochester, and who asserted that Lathrop was suffering from the delusion that somebody was trying to poison her. Her answer was that it was not a delusion, that somebody was endeavoring to poison her. But she was willing to accept proof to the contrary, which was also evidence that there was no delusion. Nonetheless, her incarceration ensued.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com" /&gt;  By the time Lathrop was admitted to the asylum, she was 32 years old and unmarried despite engagements to two different men.  Her first engagement was broken off by her fiancé due to cold feet and her second betrothed died from consumption.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The hospital, according to Lathrop was “a living tomb.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Secret Institution|last=Lathrop|first=Clarissa Caldwell|publisher=Bryant Publishing Co.|year=1890|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a few weeks of her arrival at Utica, Lathrop had written letters to two of her physician friends only to find out later that her letters had never been mailed.  The attending physician claimed they were not sent because the asylum was not obliged to send her letters “all over the country.”  Lathrop was “amazed and dumbfounded” at the idea that not only would her letters be read by the asylum doctors, but that they would never reach their intended destination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Secret Institution|last=Lathrop|first=Clarissa Caldwell|publisher=Bryant Publishing Co.|year=1890|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=127–128}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lathrop had easily made a friend who had revealed to her how she would be able to communicate to the outside world without getting caught by the authorities. She obtained paper through another patient who had hidden the contraband in her room. The woman would not out rightly give the paper to Lathrop for fear of punishment for aiding and abetting, but hinted that there was nothing she could do if Lathrop took a page or two while she was elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Secret Institution|last=Lathrop|first=Clarissa Caldwell|publisher=Bryant Publishing Co.|year=1890|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lathrop also wrote on newspaper edges and scraps of wrapping paper which she also hid in her skirt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Secret Institution|last=Lathrop|first=Clarissa Caldwell|publisher=Bryant Publishing Co.|year=1890|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, she managed to communicate with Silkman, a New York lawyer, who had been forcibly carried off and imprisoned in the same insane asylum. He obtained a writ of ''habeas corpus'' at once on behalf of Lathrop, and in December, 1882, Judge Barnard of the New York Supreme Court pronounced Lathrop to be sane and unlawfully incarcerated.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=450}}

===Social reformer and autobiographer===
Immediately upon her release, Lathrop went before the New York State Legislature. She described her experience and the necessity for reform. After making another fruitless effort the succeeding year, she found herself homeless and penniless, and dependent upon a cousin's generosity for shelter and support, forced to begin her new life under the most difficult circumstances.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=450}}[[File:A Secret Institution (1890).png|thumb|''A Secret Institution'' (1890)]]
Lathrop collected money for a charitable society on a commission, spending her evenings studying stenography and typewriting. She soon started a business of her own and was successful as a [[court stenographer]]. Ten years after her release, she wrote her book, ''A Secret Institution'', which was a history of her own life, written in the style of a novel, and descriptive of what she experienced or witnessed while an inmate of the Utica asylum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zXEEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA450#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=A Woman of the Century: Fourteen Hundred-seventy Biographical Sketches Accompanied by Portraits of Leading American Women in All Walks of Life|last=Willard|first=Frances Elizabeth|last2=Livermore|first2=Mary Ashton Rice|date=1893|publisher=Moulton|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keeping true to her vow “to devote the rest of [her] life to the cause of the insane,” Lathrop formed the Lunacy Law Reform and the Anti-Kidnapping Leagues.  The Leagues provided legal services to asylum patients who felt they were victims of a corrupt legal system. The goal of the leagues was to “protect sane people from false imprisonment.”  Both groups had helped several individuals who had been unjustly incarcerated secure their freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Obituary|last=|first=|date=September 13, 1892|work=The New York Times Herald|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lunacy Law Reform League in 1889, was a national organization having its headquarters in [[New York City]], of which she was secretary and national organizer.
{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=451}} Lathrop spoke out against asylum abuses, and became a spokesperson for others incarcerated as insane.{{sfn|Wood|1994|p=67}} She lived with self-doubt, fear, and suspicion, while trying to understand how incarceration affected her. She struggled with society's perceptions of her mental stability.{{sfn|Wood|1994|p=68}}

Lathrop died in [[Saratoga, New York]], on September 11, 1892,{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=450}} and is buried at Mount Hope Cemetery, in Rochester.

==Legal case==
Albert Bach, legal counsel to Lathrop, held that the interesting point in the case was the question of the deprivation of Lathrop's postal rights while in the asylum. She was not permitted to have writing materials, and even though she succeeded in obtaining them, the asylum authorities disposed of her letters as they pleased. The claim was asserted that asylum managers have no such control over inmates as have prison managers; that the former institutions have more of the character of hospitals. Bach found nothing in the by-laws of the Utica asylum giving the right to this close supervision. He said that there were many instances of wrongful incarceration, and that justice would seem to dictate that inmates of asylums should have access to the mails. Even though much of it would be trash, it would be well worth while to endure that if information could be obtained to the release of a person improperly detained.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=Will sue the aslym; Miss Lathrop alleges that she was wrongfully incarcerated.|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1890/12/20/103287284.pdf|accessdate=11 September 2017|work=The New York Times|date=20 December 1890|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports suggested that Lathrop would bring a suit of U$25,000 damages against the management of the Utica State Insane Asylum. The grounds alleged were the wrongful detention of herself, and the seizure of her letters written to friends asking them to help her to regain her liberty. Lathrop’s lawyer gave the following statement of the scope of the lawsuit: &lt;blockquote&gt;Of course the main point is in regard to the interception of letters that she wrote to friends asking for assistance. If the managers of the asylums have the right to intercept letters, they have the power to shut a person entirely from the world, whether the person be insane or not. This is a difference between a criminal and a lunatic. In the case of a criminal he is in his position through his own fault, but the insane person is a patient, and deserves all possible consideration. If they stop a person’s letters, they virtually remove from that person the possibility of obtaining release. The suit is brought not so much for the sake of damages, as to test the point whether or not the managers of asylums have a right to enforce such a rule. I have become interested in the matter, and intend to follow it up and test the question thoroughly. One of the things I will do will be to write to the Postmaster General, asking if it would not be advisable in case we can prove that the authorities are wrong in prohibiting the forwarding of letters, to place free delivery boxes in all asylums, that the patients may have a chance to correspond without difficulty with their friends. I believe such a system would do away with much of the abuse that without doubt exists in many asylums, and would greatly lessen the chance of sane persons being held in confinement.{{sfn|Jerdone|1891|p=59}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5562">The '''Climate Summit 2014''' (sometimes also referred to as the '''Leader's Climate Summit''') was a meeting on climate change in [[New York City|New York]] on September 23, 2014. UN Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] announced it in September 2013 and invited leaders of governments, the private sector, and civil society to unite in taking concrete action towards a low-carbon world.

The Summit's focus was on initiatives and actions rather than on negotiations between countries. It was seen as a milestone on the path towards closing the ''emissions gap'' between reduction pledges and the necessary emission cuts for the [[Climate change mitigation|2 °C scenario]] (with "pursue efforts to" limit the temperature increase to 1.5&amp;nbsp;°C), and to a new legal agreement on climate change, to be approved by the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference|COP21 in Paris]] in December 2015. One product of the Summit was the [[New York Declaration on Forests]].

== Developments and positions prior to the Summit ==
After the [[2013 United Nations Climate Change Conference|COP19 in Warsaw]], the Climate Summit was the next high-level gathering on climate change. Since the [[Kyoto Protocol]]'s second commitment period expires in 2020, the [[UNFCCC]] process attempts to establish a new worldwide contract about climate protection and emission reduction objectives, that is to be drafted in 2014 at the [[2014 United Nations Climate Change Conference|COP20 in Lima]] and adopted in 2015 at the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference|COP21 in Paris]]. The Climate Summit in September 2014 is not part of this negotiating process, but is expected to serve as a kick-off for a year of intense activity in climate policy and an indicator on the countries' ambitions to reduce emissions and support climate protection. Having this in mind, UN Secretary-General Ban invited leaders of governments, the private sector and [[civil society]] from all over the world to unite in action:

{{quote|I challenge you to bring to the Summit bold pledges.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1910">A '''crisis camp''' is a [[BarCamp]] gathering of [[Information technology|IT]] professionals, [[software developer]]s, and computer [[programmer]]s to aid in the relief efforts of a major crisis such as those caused by [[earthquake]]s, [[flood]]s, or [[hurricane]]s. Projects that crisis camps often work on include setting up [[social network]]s for people to locate missing friends and relatives, creating maps of affected areas, and creating inventories of needed items such as food and clothing.

Following the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]], many crisis camps were set up around the world, often under the name "Crisis Camp Haiti", to help with the relief effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nation-and-world/la-fg-haiti-crisiscamp17-2010jan17,0,6468659.story |title=Crisis Camp Haiti: Techno-types volunteer their computer skills to aid quake victims |publisher=''Los Angeles Times'' |accessdate=January 19, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100120063956/http://www.latimes.com/news/nation-and-world/la-fg-haiti-crisiscamp17-2010jan17%2C0%2C6468659.story |archivedate=January 20, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7534">'''Dataism''' is a term that has been used to describe the mindset or philosophy created by the emerging significance of [[Big data|Big Data]]. It was first used by [[David Brooks (cultural commentator)|David Brooks]] in the [[The New York Times|New York Times]] in 2013.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; More recently, the term has been expanded to describe what social scientist [[Yuval Noah Harari]] has called an emerging ideology or even a new form of religion, in which 'information flow' is the 'supreme value'.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== History ==
"If you asked me to describe the rising philosophy of the day, I'd say it is Data-ism", wrote [[David Brooks (cultural commentator)|David Brooks]] in the New York Times in February 2013.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/05/opinion/brooks-the-philosophy-of-data.html|title=Opinion {{!}} The Philosophy of Data|last=Brooks|first=David|date=2013-02-04|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-01-05|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks argued that in a world of increasing complexity, relying on data can reduce cognitive biases and "illuminate patterns of behavior we haven't yet noticed".

In 2015, Steve Lohr's book 'Data-ism' looked at how Big Data is transforming society, using the term to describe the Big Data revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/you-can-run-from-big-data-but-can-you-hide/2015/03/20/082ea46c-c805-11e4-a199-6cb5e63819d2_story.html|title=You can run from Big Data, but can you hide?|last=Igo|first=Sarah E.|date=2015-03-20|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-01-05|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/861210012|title=Data-ism : The Revolution Transforming Decision Making, Consumer Behavior, and Almost Everything Else|last=Lohr|first=Steve|publisher=HarperBusiness|year=May 2015|isbn=0062226819|edition=First|location=New York, NY|pages=|oclc=861210012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development by Harari ===
In his 2016 book, [[Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow|Homo Deus]], [[Yuval Noah Harari]] takes the idea of Dataism further, putting it into a historical context. He argues that all competing political or social structures can be seen as data processing systems: "Dataism declares that the universe consists of data flows, and the value of any phenomenon or entity is determined by its contribution to data processing"&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow|last=Harari|first=Yuval Noah|publisher=Vintage Penguin Random House|year=2017|isbn=9781784703936|location=UK|pages=428}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:Hilbert_InfoGrowth.png|thumb|Harari expands on the term: A Dataist is someone that trusts Big Data (above) and computer algorithms, in preference to human knowledge and wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/953597984|title=Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow|last=Harari|first=Yuval Noah|date=2017|publisher=Vintage|year=|isbn=9781784703936|location=UK|pages=429|oclc=953597984}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Harari posits that "we may interpret the entire human species as a single data processing system, with individual humans serving as its chips."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow|last=Harari|first=Yuval Noah|publisher=Vintage, Penguin Random House|year=2017|isbn=9781784703936|location=UK|pages=440}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then argues that the whole of human history can be read as a process of improving the efficiency of this system by increasing the number and variety of processors/chips (humans) in the system, increasing the number of connections between the processors and increasing the freedom of movement along existing connections. A condensed form of this argument can be read in Harari's Wired article from 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/yuval-noah-harari-dataism|title='Homo sapiens is an obsolete algorithm': Yuval Noah Harari on how data could eat the world|last=Harari|first=Yuval|access-date=2018-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harari goes on to argue that Dataism, like any other religion, has practical commandments. A Dataist should want to "maximise dataflow by connecting to more and more media"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow|last=Harari|first=Yuval Noah|publisher=Vintage Penguin Random House|year=2017|isbn=9781784703936|location=UK|pages=445}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and believes that freedom of information is "the greatest good of all". Harari also argues that [[Aaron Swartz]], who took his life in 2013 after being prosecuted for releasing hundreds of thousands of scientific papers from the [[JSTOR]] archive online for free, could be called the "first martyr" of Dataism.

Writing in the Financial Times, Harari argued that Dataism presents an existential challenge to the dominant moral ideology of Humanism, which sees human feelings as the ultimate authority in the world: "humanism is now facing an existential challenge and the idea of “free will” is under threat... Once Big Data systems know me better than I know myself, authority will shift from humans to algorithms."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/50bb4830-6a4c-11e6-ae5b-a7cc5dd5a28c|title=Yuval Noah Harari on big data, Google and the end of free will|last=Harari|first=Yuval Noah|date=2016-08-26|website=Financial Times|access-date=2018-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harari predicts that the logical conclusion of this process is that eventually humans will give algorithms the authority to make the most important decisions in their lives, such as who to marry and which career to pursue.

== Criticism ==
Commenting on Harari's characterisation of Dataism, security analyst Daniel Miessler believes that Dataism does not present the challenge to the ideology of liberal humanism that Harari claims, because humans will simultaneously be able to believe in their own importance and that of data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://danielmiessler.com/blog/some-thoughts-on-dataism/|title=Some Thoughts on Dataism|date=2017-04-07|work=Daniel Miessler|access-date=2018-01-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harari himself raises some criticisms, such as the problem of consciousness, which Dataism is unlikely to illuminate. Humans may also find out that organisms are not algorithms, he suggests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dataethics.eu/en/humanism-dataism-future-scenario/|title=From Humanism to Dataism. A future scenario. - Dataethical Thinkdotank|date=2017-04-25|work=Dataethical Thinkdotank|access-date=2018-01-05|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other analysts such as Terry Ortleib have looked at the extent to which Dataism poses a dystopian threat to humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Terry Ortlieb|title=is Harari Dataism Dystopian|date=2017-03-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ev0Q4tCwgdI|accessdate=2018-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European social model''' is a common vision many European states have for a society that combines economic growth with high [[living standard]]s and good [[working conditions]]. Historian [[Tony Judt]] has argued that the European social model "binds Europe together" in contrast to the '[[American way of life]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/may/17/politics1|title=The Guardian|last=Laity|first=Paul|date=17 May 2008|work=Uncomfortable truths. Interview with Tony Judt.|accessdate=2 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

European states do not all use a single [[social model]], but [[welfare state]]s in Europe do share several broad characteristics. These generally include a commitment to [[full employment]], [[social protection]]s for all citizens, [[social inclusion]], and democracy. Examples common among European countries include [[universal health care]], free higher education, strong labor protections and regulations, and generous welfare programs in areas such as unemployment insurance, retirement pensions, and public housing. The [[Treaties of Rome|Treaty of the European Community]] set out several social objectives: "promotion of employment, improved living and working conditions ... proper social protection, dialogue between management and labour, the development of human resources with a view to lasting high employment and the combating of exclusion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etuc.org/a/2771|title=The European Social Model|date=21 March 2007|publisher=European Trade Union Confederation|accessdate=4 January 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109165943/http://www.etuc.org/a/2771|archive-date=9 November 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because different European states focus on different aspects of the model, it has been argued that there are four distinct social models in Europe: the Nordic, British, Mediterranean and the Continental.&lt;ref&gt;Sapir, André. 2005. Globalisation and the Reform of European Social Models. Bruegel. http://www.bruegel.org/1425{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barr"&gt;Barr, N. (2004), ''Economics of the welfare state''. New York: Oxford University Press (USA).&lt;/ref&gt;

The general outlines of a European social model emerged during the [[Post-World War II economic expansion|post-war boom]]. [[Tony Judt]] lists a number of causes: the abandonment of [[protectionism]], the [[Post-World War II baby boom|baby boom]], cheap energy, and a desire to catch up with [[living standards]] enjoyed in the United States. The European social model also enjoyed a low degree of external competition as the Soviet bloc, China and India were not yet integrated into the global economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12767280&amp;source=login_payBarrier|title=The Economist|last=Charlemagne|date=11 December 2008|work=The left's resignation note|accessdate=2 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, it has become common to question whether the European social model is sustainable in the face of low birthrates, [[globalisation]], [[Europeanisation]] and an [[Ageing of Europe|ageing population]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brusselsjournal.com/node/933|title=Europe's Ailing Social Model: Facts &amp; Fairy-Tales|author=Martin De Vlieghere|author2=Paul Vreymans|last-author-amp=yes|date=23 March 2006|work=The Brussels Journal|accessdate=3 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bof.fi/en/suomen_pankki/ajankohtaista/puheet/2007/EL_puhe27112007.htm|title=Remarks by Governor Liikanen: "A European Social Model: an Asset or a Liability?"|date=27 November 2007|publisher=The World Political Forum|accessdate=3 January 2010|location=Budapest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Welfare state in Europe==
[[Image:Social Expenditures in the EU.jpg|thumb|right|400px]]
Some of the European welfare states have been described as the most well developed and extensive.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.ncl.ac.uk/cre/publish/pdfs/wp61a.pdf article]&lt;/ref&gt; A unique "European social model" is described in contrast with the social model existing in the US.

===Nordic model===
{{see also|Nordic model}}
As can be seen in the graph to the right, the Nordic model holds the highest level of [[social insurance]]. Its main characteristic is its universal provision nature which is based on the principle of "citizenship". Therefore, there exists a more generalised access, with lower conditionability, to the social provisions.

As regards labour market, these countries are characterised by important expenditures in [[active labour market policies]] whose aim is a rapid reinsertion of the [[unemployment|unemployed]] into the labour market. These countries are also characterised by a high share of [[public employment]]. Trade unions have a high membership and an important decision-making power which induces a low wage dispersion or more equitable income distribution.

The Nordic model is also characterised by a high [[tax wedge]].

===Continental model===
{{see also|Rhine capitalism}}
The Continental model has some similarities with the Nordic model. Nevertheless, it has a higher share of its expenditures devoted to pensions. The model is based on the principle of "security" and a system of subsidies which are not conditioned to employability (for example in the case of France or Belgium, there exist subsidies whose only requirement is being older than 25).

As regards the labour market, active policies are less important than in the Nordic model and in spite of a low membership rate, trade-unions have important decision-making powers in [[collective agreement]]s.

Another important aspect of the Continental model is the [[disability pension]]s.

===Anglo-Saxon model===
{{main|Anglo-Saxon economy}}
The Anglo-Saxon model features a lower level of expenditures than the previous ones. Its main particularity is its [[social assistance]] of last resort. Subsidies are directed to a higher extent to the working-age population and to a lower extent to pensions. Access to subsidies is (more) conditioned to employability (for instance, they are conditioned on having worked previously).

Active labour market policies are important. Instead, trade unions have smaller decision-making powers than in the previous models, this is one of the reasons explaining their higher income dispersion and their higher number of low-wage employments.

===Mediterranean model===&lt;!-- "Mediterranean model" redirects here --&gt;
The '''Mediterranean model'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; corresponds to southern European countries who developed their [[welfare state]] later than the previous ones (during the 1970s and 1980s). It is the model with the lowest share of expenditures and is strongly based on pensions and a low level of social assistance. There exists in these countries a higher segmentation of rights and status of persons receiving subsidies which has as one of its consequences a strongly conditioned access to social provisions.

The main characteristic of labour market policies is a rigid [[employment protection legislation]] and a frequent resort to [[early retirement]] policies as a means to improve employment conditions. Trade unions tend to have an important membership which again is one of the explanations behind a lower income dispersion than in the Anglo-Saxon model.

==Evaluating the different social models==
[[Image:Reducción en la pobreza de los Modelos Sociales Europeos.png|thumb|350px|Reduction in poverty by the different European social models. Reduction in [[Gini index]] after transfers and taxes (in percentage change).]]
[[Image:Eficiencia Gastos Sociales.jpg|thumb|350px|Efficiency of social expenditures in the four European social models]]

To evaluate the different social models, we follow the criteria used in Boeri (2002) and Sapir (2005) which consider that a social model should satisfy the following:
# Reduction in poverty. 
# Protection against labour market risks. 
# Rewards for labour participation.

===Reduction in poverty===
The graph on the right shows the reduction in inequality (as measured by the [[Gini index]]) after taking account of taxes and transfers, that is, to which extent does each social model reduce poverty without taking into account the reduction in poverty provoqued by taxes and transfers. The level of social expenditures is an indicator of the capacity of each model to reduce poverty: a bigger share of expenditures is in general associated to a higher reduction in poverty. Nevertheless, another aspect that should be taken into account is the efficiency in this poverty reduction. By this is meant that with a lower share of expenditures a higher reduction in poverty may be obtained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Sergiusz| last = Prokurat|title =European Social Model and East Asian Economic Model – different approach to productivity and competition in economy|publisher= Asia – Europe. Partnership or Rivalry?”|date= 2010|accessdate=4 August 2016|location= Wrocław|pages= 35–47|url= http://www.proeconomics.pl/artykuly/ESMandEAEM.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this case, the graph on the right shows that the Anglosaxon and Nordic models are more efficient than the Continental or Mediterranean ones. The Continental model appears to be the least efficient. Given its high level of social expenditures, one would expect a higher poverty reduction than that attained by this model. Remark how the Anglosaxon model is found above the average line drawn whereas the Continental is found below that line.

===Protection against labour market risks===
[[Image:Relación entre protección al empleo y % trabajadores con beneficios desempleo.jpg|thumb|350px|As can be seen, there exists a negative relationship between [[employment protection legislation]] and the share of workers receiving [[unemployment benefits]].]]

Protection against labour market risks is generally assured by two means: 
# Regulation of the labour market by means of employment protection legislation which basically increases firing costs and [[severance payments]] for the employers. This is generally referred to as providing "employment" protection.
# [[Unemployment benefit]]s which are commonly financed with taxes or [[mandatory public insurance]]s to the employees and employers. This is generally referred to as providing protection to the "worker" as opposed to "employment".

As can be seen in the graph, there is a clear trade-off between these two types of labour market instruments (remark the clear negative slope between both). Once again different European countries have chosen a different position in their use of these two mechanisms of labour market protection. These differences can be summarised as follows: 
* The Mediterranean countries have chosen a higher "employment" protection while a very low share of their unemployed workers receives unemployment benefits. 
* The Nordic countries have chosen to protect to a lesser extent "employment" and instead, an important share of their unemployed workers receives benefits. 
* The continental countries have a higher level of both mechanisms than the European average, although by a small margin. 
* The Anglo-Saxon countries base their protection on unemployment benefits and a low level of employment protection.

Evaluating the different choices is a hard task. In general there exists consensus among economists on the fact that employment protection generates inefficiencies inside firms. Instead, there is no such consensus as regards the question of whether employment protection generates a higher level of unemployment.

===Rewards for labour participation===
[[Image:Ratio Empleo-Población.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Employment rate|Employment]] and [[Unemployment rate|unemployment]] rates for each social model]]
Sapir (2005) and Boeri (2002) propose looking at the [[employment-to-population ratio]] as the best way to analyse the incentives and rewards for employment in each social model. The [[Lisbon Strategy]] initiated in 2001 established that the members of the EU should attain a 70% employment rate by 2010.

In this case, the graph shows that the countries in the Nordic and Anglosaxon model are the ones with the highest employment rate whereas the Continental and Mediterranean countries have not attained the Lisbon Strategy target.

===Conclusion===
[[Image:Tipologia de los distintos modelos sociales europeos.png|thumb|400px|Classifying the different social models according to their [[Economic efficiency|efficiency]] and [[Equity (economics)|equity]]. Elevada means high whereas Baja means low.]]
Sapir (2005) proposes as a general mean to evaluate the different social models, the following two criteria: 
# [[Economic efficiency|Efficiency]], that is, whether the model provides the incentives so as to achieve the largest number possible of employed persons, that is, the highest [[employment rate]]. 
# Equity, that is, whether the social model achieves a relatively low poverty risk.

As can be seen in the graph, according to these two criteria, the best performance is achieved by the Nordic model. The Continental model should improve its efficiency whereas the Anglosaxon model its equity. The Mediterranean model under-performs in both criteria.

Some economists consider that between the Continental model and the Anglo-Saxon, the latter should be preferred given its better results in employment, which make it more sustainable in the long term, whereas the equity level depends on the preferences of each country (Sapir, 2005). Other economists argue that the Continental model cannot be considered worse than the Anglosaxon given that it is also the result of the preferences of those countries that support it (Fitoussi et al., 2000; Blanchard, 2004). This last argument can be used to justify any policy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11273">'''French Tech''' is an accreditation awarded to [[France|French]] cities recognized for their [[startup company|startup]] ecosystem. It is also a name used by technologically innovative French businesses throughout the world.

Convinced by the necessity to promote the emergence of successful [[Startup company|start-ups]] in [[France]] to generate [[Value (economics)|economic value]] and jobs, the [[Government of France|French Government]] created the French Tech Initiative at the end of 2013. Its philosophy: build on member initiatives of the French Tech themselves, highlight what already exists, and create a [[snowball effect]]. It is a shared ambition, propelled by the State but carried and built with all the actors of the French tech company and start-up scene.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lafrenchtech.com/la-french-tech/quest-ce-que-la-french-tech|title=Qu’est-ce que la French Tech ?|website=La French Tech|access-date=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French Tech initiative also has a transversal objective: to enhance the coherence of public actions in favor of startups. It does not create a new organization or a new public tool, but is carried by a small team, Mission French Tech, which works closely with the [[French Ministry for the Economy and Finance|French Ministry of Economy and Finance]], the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Development (France)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] and with the General Commissariat for Investment. Its partners, the pillars of the initiative, are national operators, who, under the common banner "French Tech" coordinate their actions in favor of startups: [[Caisse des dépôts et consignations|Caisse des Dépôts]], [[Bpifrance (public entity)|Bpifrance]] and Business France.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Funding from the French Tech Initiative for accelerators (€ 200 million) and international attractiveness (€ 15 million) is part of the Investments for the Future program. In this context, the operator is [[Caisse des dépôts et consignations|Caisse des Dépôts]], which relies on [[Bpifrance (public entity)|Bpifrance]] for investment in accelerators and on Business France for international investments.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The French Tech aims to provide a strong common visual identity to French startups as well as to promote entrepreneurial exchanges between them.

== Historic ==
Nine French cities received French Tech accreditation in November 2014 during a first wave of certification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/secteur/high-tech/2014/11/12/01007-20141112ARTFIG00221-neuf-villes-francaises-recoivent-le-label-french-tech.php|title=Neuf villes françaises reçoivent le label "French Tech"|date=November 12, 2014|author=Lucie Ronfaut|editor=[[Le Figaro]]|access-date=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cities like [[Strasbourg]], [[Mulhouse]], [[Nice]], [[Avignon]], [[Angers]], [[Brest, France|Brest]] and [[Saint-Étienne]] preferred to wait to register their candidacies later in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rue89strasbourg.com/index.php/2014/11/12/economie-2/pas-encore-de-french-tech-pour-strasbourg/|title=Pas encore de French Tech pour Strasbourg, le dossier en retard|author= Pierre France |date=November 12, 2014 |editor=Rue89 Strasbourg|access-date=7 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, the French Minister for Digital Affairs [[Axelle Lemaire]] announced a budget of €15&amp;nbsp;million to enhance the attractiveness of the French Tech abroad.&lt;ref name="frenchtech" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lesechos"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lesechos.fr/tech-medias/hightech/0204119751357-la-french-tech-a-loffensive-a-linternational-1088284.php|title=La French Tech à l’offensive à l’international|publisher=lesechos.fr|accessdate=2015-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Banque Publique d'Investissement]] (Bpifrance) also announced it was investing €200 million in subsidies from 2015.&lt;ref name="frenchtech"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lafrenchtech.com/la-french-tech|title=La French Tech|work=lafrenchtech.com|access-date=9 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 alone, Bpifrance invested €700&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="BPI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.lafrenchtech.com/a-vibrant-ecosystem/|title= A vibrant ecosystem|work=en.lafrenchtech.com/a-vibrant-ecosystem|access-date=7 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Axelle Lemaire also announced the establishment of 'French Tech Hubs' in major international cities like [[Montreal]], New York City, London, Berlin, Barcelona, Stockholm, Tokyo, Singapore, Seoul, Shanghai, Taipei, Tel Aviv, São Paulo, Phnom Pen, Cape Town, [[Abidjan]], Moscow and Santiago.&lt;ref name="latribune"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latribune.fr/start-up/20150131trib39a53cfa8/des-ambassadeurs-pour-faire-briller-la-french-tech-a-l-international.html|title=Des ambassadeurs pour faire briller la French Tech à l’international|publisher=latribune.fr|accessdate=2015-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of which (New York City, Boston, San Francisco, Tel Aviv, Tokyo, London) have already opened since February 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bonjourlafrenchtech.com/french-tech-hubs-all-over-the-world/|title=French Tech Hubs all over the World ! - Bonjour la French Tech|date=15 October 2015|publisher=|accessdate=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://frenchtechhub.com/about/|title=About - French Tech Hub|publisher=|accessdate=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the movement continued to expand its international reach, notably in international shows and forums. In the United States of America, French startups were part of the largest foreign delegation at the [[Consumer Electronics Show|2016 Consumer Electronics Show]] (CES) in Las Vegas. 190 French Tech startups were enrolled this year, with a total of 210 French businesses on site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.journaldunet.com/web-tech/start-up/1170298-la-french-tech-en-force-au-ces-de-las-vegas/|title=La French Tech en force au CES de Las Vegas|publisher=|accessdate=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were the largest European delegation at the 2015 Consumer Electronics Show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commentcamarche.net/news/5865879-ces-2015-la-french-tech-se-prepare|title=CES 2015 : La French Tech se prépare|publisher=|accessdate=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In January 2017, the French delegation was the largest foreign delegation again at the [[Consumer Electronics Show]] in [[Las Vegas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170103006190/en/La-French-Tech-Ups-Ante-Vegas-Takes|title=La French Tech Ups the Ante in Vegas, Takes CES 2017 by Storm with Largest International Contingent of Startups|publisher=|accessdate=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, the French Tech national ecosystem has seen the inauguration of world's biggest [[business incubator]], [[Station F]], in [[Paris]]. It hosts 1,000 start-ups within 34,000 square meters in the heart of the city.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thelocal.fr/20170629/silicon-on-seine-worlds-biggest-tech-incubator-opens-in-paris&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 21, 2015, eight major retailers signed a charter to highlight French Tech products on their shelves, at the French Ministry of Economy with Axelle Lemaire, Minister for Digital Affairs.&lt;ref name="Minister of Economy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economie.gouv.fr/objets-connectes-french-tech-grande-distribution|title=la grande distribution|website=economie.gouv.fr|access-date=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among those who signed the charter are major players in the retail sector, including [[Auchan]], [[Boulanger]], [[Carrefour]], [[Darty]], [[Fnac]], [[E.Leclerc]], Lick and [[Orange S.A.]].

"This charter officially marks our commitment to support French technological innovation in the field of the Internet of things, on the long term" said Daniel Broche, e-commerce director at Boulanger. The charter was signed during the national 'week of connected devices' which runs yearly until the 25th October and during which certain activities are planned in stores around France and on the internet with the hashtag #HappyFrenchTech.

Within the following weeks, only Boulanger had issued a clear statement on its application of the agreement. The brand has created a [http://www.boulanger.com/evenement/french-tech dedicated online marketplace] and agrees to sell a number of products in stores, such as a [[virtual reality]] helmet, an 'intelligent' keyring or a connected lamp.

'''Georgiana Morson''' served as a matron for Urania Cottage, a house for fallen women founded by [[Charles Dickens]] and [[Angela Burdett-Coutts, 1st Baroness Burdett-Coutts|Angela Burdett-Coutts]], as well as the [[Foundling Hospital]] during the mid-nineteenth century. 

== Personal life ==
Georgiana Morson was born Georgiana Collin in Merton. She married James Morson, a doctor for [[St George's Hospital]], in 1838. Shortly after their marriage, James Morson was appointed as Chief Medical Officer for the [[Brazilian National Mining Association]]. He died in 1848, leaving Georgiana with three children to provide for by her own efforts.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://spartacus-educational.com/DICmorsonG.htm|title=Georgiana Morson|work=Spartacus Educational|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1854, Morson would resign from her post as matron of Urania Cottage in order to marry George Wade Harrison, a printer and bookseller, and they settled in [[Sevenoaks]].

== Urania Cottage ==

On 26 May 1846, Dickens wrote Burdett-Coutts a lengthy letter stating his desire to open an asylum for girls and women working in London's streets as prostitutes. The letter included planning for the asylum ranging from finding a property in London to a detailed process of rehabilitating fallen women. For example, Dickens suggests introducing a marks system and probationary period for asylum residents. He writes: &lt;blockquote&gt;It is explained to her that she is degraded and fallen, but not lost, having this shelter; and that the means of Return to Happiness are now about to be put into her own hands, and trusted to her own keeping. That with this view, she is, instead of being placed in this probationary class for a month, or two months, or three months, or any specified time whatever, required to earn there, a certain number of Marks (they are mere scratches in a book) so that she may make her probation a very short one, or a very long one, according to her own conduct. For so much work, she has so many Marks; for a day's good conduct, so many more. For every instance of ill-temper, disrespect, bad language, any outbreak of any sort or kind, so many - a very large number in proportion to her receipts - are deducted. A perfect Debtor and Creditor account is kept between her and the Superintendent, for every day; and the state of that account, it is in her own power and nobody else's, to adjust to her advantage. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://spartacus-educational.com/DICurania.htm|title=Urania Cottage|work=Spartacus Educational|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Dickens located a home for the asylum originally named Urania Cottage in Shepherds Bush, Middlesex in 1847. He worked closely with Burdett-Coutts in the asylum founding and administration, regularly attending meetings and writing about the home in his journal, ''[[All the Year Round]]''.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Coutts, Angela Georgina Burdett-, suo jure Baroness Burdett-Coutts (1814–1906), philanthropist|last=Healey|first=Edna|date=2004-09-23|publisher=Oxford University Press|series=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/32175}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Opening to residents in November 1847, the institution provided food, shelter, and a detailed daily routine for the residents. Residents learned to read and write, worked in the garden, completed all household tasks including needlework, attended singing lessons, and cooked food for local poor relief.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Georgiana Morson served as a dedicated matron of Urania Cottage from 1849 to 1854. In her book, ''Charles Dickens and the House of Fallen Women'' (2009), Jenny Hartley describes how, "Georgiana Morson proved herself the best matron Urania ever had... she taught the girls to read and write, as well as all the household skills a servant needed. She presided over the dining table, and made mealtimes a social occasion the girls had not known before. They ate the good food she had taught them to cook and chattered about their future prospects." &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; 

Dickens praised Morson's oversight at Urania Cottage in a letter recommending her as matron for the Foundling Hospital in 1852. Writing to the governors of the hospital on 9 July 1852, Dickens describes her "capacity for the administration of such an office."&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dickensletters.com/letters/governors-foundling-hospital-9-july-1852|title=To the Governors of the Foundling Hospital, 9 July 1852|last=Ben|date=2018-06-03|website=www.dickensletters.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on to explain that:&lt;blockquote&gt;She is a lady of great discretion, of remarkable sweetness of temper, and has a power of uniting firmness with conciliation in a very remarkable and uncommon manner. I have never known her to make a mistake even under circumstances of great difficulty, and I have invariably found that those under her care have become attached to her. She is accustomed to method, order, punctuality, and to a habit of sound and judicious observation. I would entrust her, myself, with the duties to which she now aspires, in preference to any lady I have ever seen in a similar capacity.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3114">'''Harry Cassidy''' (1900–1951) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] academic, social reformer, civil servant and, briefly, a politician.

Cassidy was a pioneer in the field of social work. He was the founding dean of the School of Social Welfare at University of California, Berkeley in the early 1940s before resigning to work for the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]]. He subsequently became dean of the School of Social Work at the [[University of Toronto]].

In the 1930s he was involved with the [[League for Social Reconstruction]] and was a founding member of the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]], however, in 1950 he ran for the leadership of the [[Ontario Liberal Party]] coming in second in the [[Ontario Liberal Leadership Conventions|party leadership convention]].

Cassidy conducted studies of welfare services beginning in the 1930s and 1940s and influenced the creation of a Canadian  [[welfare state]] and improved social services as a means of improving society and alleviating poverty. During the [[Great Depression]] he argued that the government of [[R.B. Bennett]] should create a broad system of social services such as Unemployment Insurance as a shock absorber against poverty. His research influenced Bennett's decision to try to emulate [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] and some of his ideas were ultimately taken up by the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] government of [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] in the 1940s, particularly after Cassidy published his 1943 study ''Social Security and Reconstruction in Canada''. He continued to criticize Canada's social security system as inadequate, writing in 1947 that "The provisions for general assistance are limited, restrictive, mean, and antiquated ... .[T]hey are literally disgraceful and unworthy of a nation of Canada's status".

He also worked for a period in the civil service as deputy minister of welfare in [[British Columbia]].

Cassidy's son, [[Michael Cassidy (Canadian politician)|Michael Cassidy]], was a [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]] politician and leader in the 1980s and 1990s.

'''Heritage interpretation''' refers to all the ways in which information is communicated to visitors to an educational, natural or recreational site, such as a museum, park or science centre. More specifically it is the communication of information about, or the explanation of, the nature, origin, and purpose of historical, natural, or cultural resources, objects, sites and phenomena using personal or non-personal methods.  Some international authorities in [[museology]] prefer the term '''mediation''' for the same concept, following usage in other European languages.

Heritage interpretation may be performed at dedicated [[interpretation centres]] or at [[museum]]s, historic sites, [[parks]], art galleries, nature centres, [[zoos]], [[Public aquarium|aquaria]], [[botanical gardens]], nature reserves and a host of other heritage sites. Its modalities can be extremely varied and may include [[guided walks]], [[Speech|talks]], [[drama]], staffed stations, displays, signs, labels, artwork, brochures, interactives, audio-guides and audio-visual media. The process of developing a structured approach to interpreting these stories, messages and information is called [[interpretive planning]]. The [[Thematic interpretation|thematic approach]] to heritage interpretation advocated by University of Idaho professor Sam Ham, the [[National Association for Interpretation]], the US [[National Park Service]], and others, is considered best practice.&lt;ref name="Brochu (2003)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brochu|first=Lisa|title=Interpretive planning|year=2003|publisher=InterpPress|location=Fort Collins, CO|isbn=1-879931-12-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brochu &amp; Merriman (2002)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brochu|first=Lisa|title=Personal Interpretation: Connecting Your Audience to Heritage Resources|year=2002|publisher=InterpPress|location=Fort Collins, CO|isbn=1-879931-06-0|author2=Merriman, Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Caputo et al.

The goal of interpretation is to improve and enrich the visitor experience by helping site visitors understand the significance of the place they are visiting, and connecting those meanings to visitors' own personal lives.&lt;ref name="NPSNR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/publications/bulletins/interp/int4.htm|title=Telling the Stories, Part 4: National Register of Historic Places Bulletin|first=Jeff|last=Joeckel|date=1 February 2002|website=nps.gov|accessdate=24 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180126185330/https://www.nps.gov/nr/publications/bulletins/interp/int4.htm|archivedate=26 January 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By weaving compelling, thematic stories about environmental phenomena and historical events, interpreters aim to provoke visitors to learn and think about their experiences.

Interpretation is often used by landowning government agencies and NGOs to promote [[environmental stewardship]] of the lands they manage.

== "Tilden's principles" of interpretation ==

In his 1957 book, "Interpreting Our Heritage", [[Freeman Tilden]] defined six principles of interpretation:
{{quote|
# Any interpretation that does not somehow relate what is being displayed or described to something within the personality or experience of the visitor will be sterile.
# Information, as such, is not Interpretation. Interpretation is revelation based upon information. But they are entirely different things. However all interpretation includes information.
# Interpretation is an art, which combines many arts, whether the materials presented are scientific, historical or architectural. Any art is in some degree teachable.
# The chief aim of Interpretation is not instruction, but provocation.
# Interpretation should aim to present a whole rather than a part, and must address itself to the whole man rather than any phase.
# Interpretation addressed to children (say up to the age of twelve) should not be a dilution of the presentation to adults, but should follow a fundamentally different approach. To be at its best it will require a separate program.}}

For the past 50 years, Tilden's principles have remained highly relevant to interpreters across the world. In 2002 Larry Beck and Ted Cable published "Interpretation for the 21st Century - Fifteen Guiding Principles for Interpreting Nature and Culture", which elaborated upon Tilden's original principles. In 2011, Beck and Cable released a new version of their principles in "The Gift of Interpretation".&lt;ref&gt;Beck, L, Cable,T. (2011) ''The Gifts of Interpretation: Fifteen guiding principles for interpreting nature and culture''.

Generally there is a [[fee]] for this service; however very small amounts and single email letters may be free of charge depending on the [[service provider]] and generally fees are much lower than directly sending mail or using a franking machine.

There are also reverse systems, where handwritten letters can be delivered as email. This mail scanning service, sometimes called '''letter email''', is increasingly popular with businesses and individuals who wish to access their mail from another country. However, special care must be taken to inspect local laws and the service provider's scanning practices to ensure that they are not reading the mail or acting on behalf of the client from a legal standpoint.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The '''Internal Market Information System''' (IMI) is an IT-based network that links public bodies in the [[European Economic Area]]. It was developed by the [[European Commission]] together with the [[Member States of the European Union]] to speed up cross-border administrative cooperation. IMI allows public administrations at national, regional and local level to identify their counterparts in other countries and to exchange information with them. Pre-translated questions and answers as well as [[machine translation]] make it possible for them to use their own language to communicate.

==Background==
[[Internal Market|Internal market]] legislation of the [[European Union]] (EU) makes it mandatory for competent authorities in Member States to assist their counterparts abroad by providing them with information. Some legislation also requires communication between Member States and the European Commission (for example for the notification of national implementing measures of [[European Union law]]). IMI has been developed in order to facilitate this day-to-day exchange of information.

IMI was launched in February 2008. Development and maintenance has been funded by the programme [[Interoperability Solutions for European Public Administrations]] (ISA) since July 2010. ISA is the successor to the [[IDABC]] program, which initially funded IMI and came to an end on 31 December 2009.  

IMI is one of the governance tools of the Single Market. Other such tools are Your Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/youreurope/index.htm |title=Your Europe website}}&lt;/ref&gt; Your Europe Advice,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/citizensrights/front_end/about/index_en.htm |title=your Europe Advice website}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Solvit]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/solvit/ |title=SOLVIT website}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Points of Single Contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/eu-go/index_en.htm |title=Points of Single Contact website}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
IMI applies a "[[Privacy by Design]]" approach – integrating privacy and data protection compliance in all stages of the design of IMI – which has been developed in consultation with the [[European Data Protection Supervisor]] (EDPS).
Administrative coordination is legally determinate and provided in a form of legal assistance between responsible [[institutions]]. In the case of the IMI system, administrative coordination encompasses some modes of administrative [[cooperation]] related to information provision ([[information exchange]] or [[data]] provision); shared administrative procedures execution (obligation to execute a single administrative decision/act by an institution from different Member States) and [[Business networking|networking]] on a specific institutional structure (working of [[Government agency|agencies]] or groups in formalised [[policy]] [[implementation]] processes)&lt;ref&gt;Civinskas, R., Dvorak, J., Guogis, A. (2017). The Administrative Side of Industrial Relations in Selected EU Countries: Case of Posted Workers. Montenegrin Journal of Economics, Vol. 13 (4), p. 131-147 http://www.mnje.com/sites/mnje.com/files/131_-_148_-_z_12_-_civinskas_et_al.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main Actors==
IMI has been rolled out in a decentralised way. Therefore, the practical implementation of IMI is the responsibility of the individual Member States. There are several actors that play a role in the IMI network.

===Competent Authorities===
Competent authorities are the end users of IMI. They are public bodies that have been given the responsibility to deal with certain elements of application of internal market legislation. They can function on national, regional or local level.

===IMI Coordinators===
There is one national IMI coordinator (NIMIC) per Member State, often located in a national ministry. Their task is to ensure the smooth operation of IMI in their country. IMI coordinators may delegate some of their responsibilities to additional coordinators who are in charge of, for example, one legislative area or a geographical region, depending on each Member State’s administrative structures.

===European Commission===
The [[European Commission]] is responsible for maintenance and development of the tool, helpdesk services and training. It also manages and supports the network of IMI coordinators, promotes further expansion of IMI and reports on the functioning of the system. 

==IMI Workflows==
IMI offers a number of workflows to its users in order to facilitate different types of administrative cooperation across the [[Member states of the European Economic Area]]. 

===Information requests===
When a competent authority needs information from a counterpart abroad, it can send a request for information. This exchange mechanism uses lists of pre-translated questions and answers available in all EU languages. It is also possible to attach documents. Only the competent authorities that are directly involved in an information exchange have access to the content. A practical example of an information request is when a German teacher would like to continue his activities in [[Portugal]]. The Portuguese authority needs to verify the authenticity of his scanned diploma. It can then use IMI to send an information request to its partner authority in [[Germany]]. This authority can accept the request and send an answer back to the authority in Portugal. Due to the pre-translated question and answer sets, both authorities can communicate in their own language.

===Notifications===
Notifications are based on one-to-many information exchanges where authorities can alert or notify one or more competent authorities and/or the [[European Commission]]. For example, the [[Services Directive]] requires that Member States alert each other of possible dangers to the health and safety of people or to the environment caused in the provision of services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2006:376:0036:0068:en:PDF |title=Directive on Services in the Internal Market |date=2006-12-12 |accessdate=2012-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Information repositories===
IMI information repositories are databases storing specific information for certain policy areas. An example of such a repository is the directory of registers maintained by competent authorities throughout the [[European Economic Area]]. This directory is equipped with multilingual search functions. The content of a repository can be accessed either by a restricted group of competent authorities or by all IMI users.

==Legal Framework==
IMI is used in all Member States of the European Economic Area for the administrative cooperation required by the Directive on the Recognition of Professional Qualifications (2005/36/EC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/qualifications/index_en.htm |title=Free movement of professionals - European Commission |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date=2012-02-13 |accessdate=2012-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Directive on services in the internal market]] (2006/123/EC)  and, on a pilot basis, by the Posting of Workers Directive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=471 |title=Posted workers - European Commission |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date=2012-06-20 |accessdate=2012-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since November 2012, it provides a repository for information on licence holders for the cross-border road transport of Euro cash&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:316:0001:0020:EN:PDF |title=Regulation on the cross-border transport of euro cash by road between euro-area Member States  |date=2011-11-16 |accessdate=2012-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an IT platform for the problem solving network [[Solvit]]. IMI is being expanded to cover further legislative areas. For example, the Directive on Patients' Rights in Cross-border Healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:088:0045:0065:EN:PDF |title=Directive on Patients' Rights in Cross-border Healthcare |date=2011-03-09 |accessdate=2012-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
IMI aims to "become a flexible toolkit at the service of administrative cooperation, contributing to the improved governance of the [[Internal Market]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/imi-net/docs/strategy_paper_en.pdf |title=Communication on Better governance of the Single Market through greater administrative cooperation |date=2011-02-21 |accessdate=2012-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The IMI Regulation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32012R1024:EN:NOT |title=Regulation on administrative cooperation through the Internal Market Information System  |date=2012-10-25 |accessdate=2012-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; which came into force in December 2012 is an EU law establishing a comprehensive legal framework for IMI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europolitics.info/sectorial-policies/new-rules-for-imi-take-effect-art345947-17.html |title=New rules for IMI take effect |publisher=europolitics.info |date=2012-12-05 |accessdate=2012-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It provides a complete set of rules for the processing of personal data in IMI and prescribes a method for future expansion of IMI to additional policy areas.

'''International Whores' Day''' or '''International Sex Workers Day''' is observed annually on June 2 of each year, honours sex workers and recognises their often exploited working conditions. The event commemorates the occupation of [[Église Saint-Nizier]] in [[Lyon]] by more than a hundred sex workers on 2 June 1975 to draw attention to their inhumane working conditions.&lt;ref name="diewelt"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.welt.de/politik/article3878794/Kirche-soll-Prostituierte-nicht-ausgrenzen.html |title=Internationaler Hurentag – Kirche soll Prostituierte nicht ausgrenzen (International Whores' Day: The church shouldn't exclude the prostitutes) |date=2009-06-07 |language=German |publisher=Die Welt - Online |accessdate=2011-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been celebrated annually since 1976. In German, it is known as ''Hurentag'' (Whore's Day). In Spanish-speaking countries, it is the ''Día Internacional de la Trabajadora Sexual'', the International Day of the Sex Worker.

== Background ==
[[File:Sex worker statue Oudekerksplein Amsterdam.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Bronze statue ''Belle'' in front of the [[Oude Kerk (Amsterdam)|Oude Kerk]] in the [[De Wallen]] red-light district in [[Amsterdam]]. It was unveiled in March 2007 with the inscription "Respect sex workers all over the world."]]
In the 1970s, French police kept sex workers under increasing pressure. The police reprisals&lt;ref name="diewelt"/&gt; forced sex workers to work increasingly in secret. As a result, protection of sex workers decreased and led to more violence against them. After two murders and the unwillingness of the government to improve the situation, [[sex worker]]s in Lyon occupied the Saint-Nizier church in rue de Brest and went on strike. The striking workers sang political chants and demanded decent working conditions and an end to stigma.

The police cleared the church after eight days.&lt;ref name="bszonline"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archiv.bszonline.de/index.php/24-archiv/urbi-et-orbi/2392-829-1-2.html |title=Internationaler Hurentag in Bochum (International Whores' Day in Bochum) |date=2010-05-17 |language=German |publisher=Bochumer Stadt- und Studierendenzeitung (bsz) |accessdate=2013-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event marks the starting point of an international movement of sex workers for [[sex workers' rights]].&lt;ref name="meritt"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sexclusivitaeten.de/herstory_leselust_09.html |title=Sag mir, wer die Huren sind (Tell me, where are the whores?) |date= |language=German |publisher=Sexclusivitäten - Laura Méritt |accessdate=2013-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Germany ==
A reading entitled "Women without rooms" in [[Bochum]], [[Germany]] on 29 May 2011 documented that the situation of sex workers has not improved since 1975. The reading was devoted to the sex workers of the neighbouring city of [[Dortmund]], who are oppressed as the sex workers of Lyon were in 1975.&lt;ref name="madonna"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.madonna-ev.de/DOKUMENTE/Lesung_Hurentag_2011pdf.pdf |title=Frauen ohne Zimmer: Lesung zum Internationalen Hurentag 2011 (Women without room: Reading for International Whores' Day) |date= |language=German |publisher=Madonna e.V. |accessdate=2013-06-02 | format=PDF; 414&amp;nbsp;kB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5097">'''Interpreting notes''' are used by some [[Language interpretation|interpreters]], who re-express oral communications (such as [[Public speaking|speeches]]) in whole or in part. Such notes may be used when the interpreter is working in "[[Language interpretation#Consecutive|consecutive mode]]."

Interpreting notes are not part of any conventional graphic system, and practitioners are free to develop their own techniques. However, some basic rules facilitate the recording of details in order to aid the interpreter in coping with large amounts of information.

==Theory==
The purpose of interpreting notes is not to [[wikt:transcribe|transcribe]] the [[Public speaking|speech]] verbatim. Interpreting notes are not a form of [[shorthand]]. Their purpose is to write minimal notes which will, at a quick glance, elicit in the interpreter's mind the intent of an oral communication so that it can be re-expressed in a different language.

It is not appropriate to document a speech in [[shorthand]], as this would result in task duplication.

==Practice==
[[Image:Interpreting notes.JPG|thumb|250px|Typical interpreting notes.]]
The interpreter should listen with utmost concentration to the speaker and write only the information which he judges sufficient to render the meaning. Numbers, names, and the [[title]]s of persons must be retained in the interpretation.

Interpreting notes are typically written in a [[notebook]] with each note being separated from the others by a horizontal line. After interpreting a sentence with the aid of a note, some interpreters might make a [[Slash (punctuation)|slash]] over it, if they have the time. This has an important psychological effect — it is similar to erasing data on a computer. Others might consider it too time-consuming to do so when a fast pace of interpretation is required or they might think that it detracts from the pace of their delivery. 

The interpreter is required to decipher his notes and to re-express their content in the target language. Following analysis of the speech, the interpreter may write the information in [[Abstract (summary)|abstract form]].

===Ideograms===
[[Ideogram]]s are an important tool used by interpreters. For example, the letter “E” laid on its side (like the [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] letter [[Sha (Cyrillic)|''sha'', Ш]]) may represent Europe. Then one can specify whether eastern, western, or central Europe is meant by slashing the relevant upward leg. A horizontal bar with two vertical bars beneath it might represent a table, which would indicate a meeting or a conference.  A bracket before an action indicates that the action will take place in the future, and vice versa.

These ideograms are linked by a system of arrows and brackets that show the structure of a sentence that is to be interpreted. Using this system, one can note, for instance, that a sum has increased or decreased by a certain percentage (according to the arrow’s direction).

For example, the notes in the illustration might be interpreted to mean : 

&lt;blockquote&gt;We are particularly glad to inform you about an important increase in our company’s revenues, which rose by 10 percent from 3.5 to 3.85 billion dollars.(*) This derives from huge sales of helicopters. The United States of America bought 50 and South Africa 20 of them. On the other hand, we must relocate parts of our production in these countries.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] (bn) is called a milliard (mrd or Md) in most languages.)*&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Some interpreters have devised complete systems of abbreviations, which include all academic titles, administrative titles, military ranks, etc. Such a system has the drawback that, like shorthand, it may be useful only for a particular language.

'''ISIDORE''' is an [[online]] platform that allows [[research]] and access to [[Human sciences|human]] and [[social sciences]] [[digital data]].

==Creation==

ISIDORE was created in 2009 by the [[CNRS]], using its '''Adonis'' large equipment' facilities, with participation from companies [[Antidot]], [[Sword Group|Sword]] and [[Mondeca]]. It is now fully integrated to the Huma-Num research infrastructure&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huma-num.fr&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==

ISIDORE harvests [[metadata]] and indexes them as [[digital data]] by enriching them with [[scientific]] terms and references. It is edited as a website, a mobile interface,&lt;ref&gt;http://m.rechercheisidore.fr&lt;/ref&gt; modules dedicated to content management through [[WordPress]], a programming interface and a [[SPARQL]] node that allows access to [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]].

ISIDORE is one of the digital platforms engaged in the sharing of scientific [[open data]]. For better accessibility, it is edited in 3 languages: [[French language|French]], [[English language|English]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]

It currently contains over 4M items, dispatched in 96 collections from over 3550 sources, making it the largest open digital library in French, English and Spanish for human and social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rechercheisidore.fr/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources==

ISIDORE associates a large panel of scientific platforms and 'data producers': 
electronic edition platforms ([[Cairn.info]], [[Persée (portal)|Persée]], [[Revues.org]], [[Érudit (édition)|Erudit]], etc.), 
[[digital libraries]]: ([[Gallica]] of the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|BnF]], Mazarinum of the [[bibliothèque Mazarine]], [[bibliothèque Sainte-Geneviève]], bibliothèque inter-universitaire de médecine, etc.)
[[Open access|open archives]] ([[HAL-SHS]] (''Hyper Article en Ligne - Sciences de l'Homme et de la Société''), [[theses.fr]], [[Thèses en Ligne TEL]], etc.) as well as a large number of other scientific databases maintained by French and foreign laboratories.

''' Ken Murray ''' (24 April 1931 – 2 October 2007) was a reforming prison officer in Scotland during the last third of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12451901.Prison_reformer_Ken_Murray_dies/ Herald Scotsman]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was educated at Inverness Technical High School. He worked as a [[Coachbuilder]] until his late twenties when he joined the [[Scottish Prison Service]]. His most notable achievement was the creation of the special unit of [[Barlinnie Prison]] which housed some of the most violent prisoners in the system, including [[Jimmy Boyle (artist)|Jimmy Boyle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/sculpture-by-former-glasgow-hardman-jimy-1049051|title=Sculpture by former Glasgow hardman Jimy Boyle on sale on eBay for £25k|last=Ferguson|first=John|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|location=Glasgow|date=28 January 2010|accessdate=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unit  was based on treating both staff and prisoners as part of a community in which all had a voice in making decisions and setting programmes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/oct/11/guardianobituaries.prisonsandprobation The Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2471">'''Leave the gate as you found it''' (or '''leave all gates as found''') is an important rule of [[courtesy]] in rural areas throughout the world. If a [[gate]] is found open, it should be left open, and if it is closed, it should be left closed. If a closed gate absolutely must be traversed, it should be closed again afterwards. It applies to visitors travelling onto or across [[farm]]s, [[ranch]]es, and [[Station (Australian agriculture)|stations]].

In low-rainfall areas, closing gates can cut [[livestock]] off from water supplies. For example, most of the land used for grazing in [[Australia]] has no natural water supplies, so drinking water for the stock must be supplied by the farmer or landowner, often by using a [[windmill]] to pump [[groundwater]]. Even visitors who know how a stock water system works may be unaware of breakdowns. During hot weather, [[cattle]] require large quantities of water to drink and can die in less than a day if they don't get it. [[Sheep]] need less water and can survive longer without it, but will die if cut off from water for several hot days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myhorse.com/training/western/an_open_and_shut_gate_on_horseback.aspx#top |title=Open and Shut a Gate Horseback |publisher=MyHorse.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In all agricultural areas, farmers need to keep groups of livestock separate, for reasons including [[Selective breeding|breeding]] for disease resistance and increased production, pest control, and controlling when ewes [[lambing|deliver their lambs]]. Unwanted mingling of flocks or herds can deprive a farmer of significant income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beginnercampingtips.com/articles/hiking-and-camping-uk.html |title=Camping Information |publisher=Beginnercampingtips.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original versions of the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[The Country Code|Country Code]] advised visitors to always close gates. The revised Countryside Code now suggests that gates should be left as found.

This is a selected list of [[Japanese language|Japanese]] words that are sometimes thought to be foreign borrowings (known as ''[[gairaigo]]'' in Japanese), but are in fact words with Japanese origins. This confusion can stem from a number of causes. [[Katakana]] are typically reserved for words of foreign origin, but are sometimes used for Japanese words of modern or irregular formation. In addition, some Japanese words bear coincidental similarities to words in other languages (known as [[false cognate]]s).

Many unproven [[conspiracy theories]] exist with varying degrees of popularity, frequently related to clandestine government plans and elaborate murder plots. Conspiracy theories usually deny consensus or cannot be proven using the [[Historical method|historical]] or [[scientific method]] and are not to be confused with research concerning verified conspiracies such as [[Gleiwitz incident|Germany's pretense for invading Poland in World War II]].

== Aviation ==
Numerous conspiracy theories pertain to air travel and aircraft. Incidents such as the 1955 bombing of the [[Kashmir Princess]], the 1985 [[Arrow Air Flight 1285]] crash, the [[1986 Mozambican Tupolev Tu-134 crash]], the 1987 [[Helderberg Disaster]], the 1988 bombing of [[Pan Am Flight 103 conspiracy theories|Pan Am Flight 103]] and the 1994 [[1994 Scotland RAF Chinook crash|Mull of Kintyre helicopter crash]] as well as various aircraft technologies and alleged sightings, have all spawned theories of foul play which deviate from official verdicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://listverse.com/2014/07/23/10-controversial-air-crash-conspiracy-theories/|work=Listverse|date=23 July 2014|title=10 Controversial Air Crash Conspiracy Theories}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Black helicopters ===
This conspiracy theory emerged in the U.S. in the 1960s. The [[John Birch Society]], who asserted that a [[United Nations]] force would soon arrive in [[black helicopters]] to bring the U.S. under UN control, originally promoted it.&lt;ref name="The Financial Times"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/468c2fb4-8372-11de-a24e-00144feabdc0|work=The Financial Times|date=7 August 2009|title=Bring out the cranks and conspiracy theorists}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory re-emerged in the 1990s, under the presidency of [[Bill Clinton]], and has been promoted by talk show host [[Glenn Beck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/apr/07/entertainment/la-et-glenn-beck-20110407|work=The Los Angeles Times|date=7 April 2011|title=Fox gives Glenn Beck's show the boot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://theweek.com/articles/580740/ben-carson-ready-coming-american-apocalypse|work=The Week|date=2 October 2015|title=Ben Carson is ready for the coming American apocalypse}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar theory concerning so-called "phantom helicopters" appeared in the UK in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/03/16/historys-greatest-conspiracy-theories/black-or-unmarked-helicopters/|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=19 November 2008|title=History's greatest conspiracy theories}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chemtrails ===
[[File:Contrail.fourengined.arp.jpg|thumb|200px|A high-flying jet's engines leaving a condensation trail ([[contrail]])]]
Also known as SLAP (Secret Large-scale Atmospheric Program), this theory alleges that water condensation trails ("[[contrails]]") from aircraft [[Chemtrail conspiracy theory|consist of chemical or biological agents]], or contain a supposedly toxic mix of [[aluminum]], [[strontium]] and [[barium]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=My month with chemtrails conspiracy theorists|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/22/california-conspiracy-theorist-farmers-chemtrails|date=22 May 2017|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; under secret government policies.  An estimated 17% of people globally believe the theory to be true or partly true. In 2016, the [[Carnegie Institution for Science]] published the first-ever peer-reviewed study of the chemtrail theory; 76 out of 77 participating atmospheric chemists and geochemists stated that they had seen no evidence to support the chemtrail theory, or stated that chemtrail theorists rely on poor [[Sampling (statistics)|sampling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Quantifying expert consensus against the existence of a secret, large-scale atmospheric spraying program|journal=Environmental Research Letters|volume=11|issue=8|pages=084011|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/8/084011|date=10 August 2016|publisher=IOP Science|doi=10.1088/1748-9326/11/8/084011|last1=Shearer|first1=Christine|last2=West|first2=Mick|last3=Caldeira|first3=Ken|last4=Davis|first4=Steven J|bibcode=2016ERL....11h4011S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Daily Telegraph"/&gt;

=== Korean Air Lines Flight 007 ===
The destruction of [[Korean Air Lines Flight 007]] by Soviet jets in 1983 has long drawn [[Korean Air Lines Flight 007 alternative theories|the interest of conspiracy theorists]]. The theories range from allegations of a planned espionage mission, to a US government cover-up, to the consumption of the passengers' remains by giant crabs.

=== Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 ===
The disappearance of [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 370]] in southeast Asia in March 2014 has prompted many theories.  One theory suggests that this plane was hidden away and reintroduced as [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17|Flight MH17]] later the same year in order to be shot down over Ukraine for political purposes.  Prolific American conspiracy theorist [[James H. Fetzer]] has placed responsibility for the disappearance with Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]].&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jul/22/mh17-five-bizarre-conspiracy-theories-zionist-plots-illuminati-russian-tv|work=The Guardian|date=22 July 2014|title=MH17: five of the most bizarre conspiracy theories}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Theories have also related to allegations that a [[Boeing Honeywell Uninterruptible Autopilot|certain autopilot]] technology was secretly fitted to the aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/cia-withholding-information-on-flight-mh370-says-former-malaysian-pm-mahathir-mohamad-20140519-zrh0a.html|title=CIA withholding information on flight MH370, says former Malaysian PM Mahathir Mohamad|work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 ===
[[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17]] was shot down over Ukraine by the Ukrainian military, Russia-backed rebels or by the Russian military in July 2014. This event has spawned numerous alternative theories. These variously include allegations that it was secretly [[Flight MH370]], that it was part of a conspiracy to conceal the "truth" about [[HIV]] (seven disease specialists were on board), or that the [[Illuminati]] or Israel was responsible.&lt;ref name="The Guardian"/&gt;

== Business and industry ==
[[File:New Coke can.jpg|thumb|70px|[[New Coke]] was manufactured between 1985 and 2002]]

===''Deepwater Horizon''===
Multiple conspiracy theories pertain to [[Deepwater Horizon|a fatal oil-rig industrial accident]] in 2010 in the Gulf of Mexico, alleging sabotage by those seeking to promote environmentalism, or a strike by North Korean or Russian submarines. Elements of such theories have been suggested or promoted by US radio host [[Rush Limbaugh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Phillips|first=David|title=Conspiracy Theories Behind BP Oil Spill in Gulf – From Dick Cheney To UFOs|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505123_162-43240454/conspiracy-theories-behind-bp-oil-spill-in-gulf----from-dick-cheney-to-ufos/|publisher=CBS News|date=1 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The conspiracy theories behind the BP oil spill|url=http://www.theweek.co.uk/13253/conspiracy-theories-behind-bp-oil-spill|work=The Week|date=14 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New Coke ===
A theory claims that [[The Coca-Cola Company]] intentionally changed to an inferior formula with [[New Coke]], with the intent either of driving up demand for the original product or permitting the reintroduction of the original with a new formula using cheaper ingredients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/cokelore/newcoke.asp |title=New Coke Origins |publisher=Snopes.com |accessdate=3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coca-Cola president [[Donald Keough]] rebutted this charge: "The truth is, we're not ''that'' dumb, and we're not that ''smart."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1048370-2,00.html | work=Time | first=John | last=Greenwald | title=Coca-Cola's Big Fizzle | date=12 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Deaths and disappearances ==
Conspiracy theories frequently emerge following the deaths of prominent leaders and public figures. In ancient times, widespread conspiracy theories were circulated [[Nero Redivivus legend|pertaining to the death of the Roman emperor Nero]], who committed suicide in 68 AD.&lt;ref name="Blount"&gt;{{cite book|last=Blount|first=Brian K.|date=2009|title=Revelation: A Commentary|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ate5WYoD_jgC&amp;pg=PA248&amp;dq=Nero+death+conspiracy+theory#v=onepage&amp;q=Nero%20death%20conspiracy%20theory|location=Louisville, Kentucky|publisher=Westminster Knox Press|isbn=978-0-664-22121-8|pages=248–249|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these theories claimed that Nero had actually faked his death and was secretly still alive, but in hiding, plotting to return and reestablish his reign.&lt;ref name="Blount"/&gt; In most of these stories, he was said to have fled to the East, where he was still loved and admired.&lt;ref name="Blount"/&gt; Other theories held that Nero really was dead, but that he would return from the dead to retake his throne.&lt;ref name="Blount"/&gt; Many [[Early Christianity|early Christians]] believed in these conspiracy theories and feared Nero's return because [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire#64-250|Nero had viciously persecuted them]].&lt;ref name="Blount"/&gt; The [[Book of Revelation]] alludes to the conspiracy theories surrounding Nero's alleged return in its description of the slaughtered head returned to life.&lt;ref name="Blount"/&gt;

Also popular are theories about the deaths of celebrities, especially musicians.

The disappearance, and often presumed death, of an individual may also become a cause for conspiracy theorists. Theories of a cover-up surrounding the 1974 [[John Bingham, 7th Earl of Lucan#Ultimate fate and reported sightings|disappearance of Lord Lucan]] following the murder of his family's nanny include, for example, allegations of a suicide plot whereby his body was fed to tigers at [[Howletts Zoo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theweek.co.uk/69274/lord-lucan-the-strangest-theories-about-his-disappearance|work=The Week|date=4 February 2016|title=Lord Lucan: the strangest theories about his disappearance}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kentonline.co.uk/canterbury/news/missing-man-fed-to-tiger-70103/|work=Kent Online|date=30 January 2016|title=Lord Lucan was fed to tiger at Howletts zoo in Canterbury, it has been claimed}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/insideout/southeast/series7/lucan_clues.shtml|publisher=BBC|date=7 March 2005|title=Lord Lucan – The Mystery Unravelled}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New World Order (conspiracy)|New World Order theory]] states that a group of international elites controls governments, industry, and media organizations, with the goal of establishing global hegemony. They are alleged to be implicated in most of the major wars of the last two centuries, to carry out secretly staged events, and to deliberately manipulate economies.  Organizations alleged to be part of the plot include the [[Federal Reserve System]], the [[Council on Foreign Relations]], [[Trilateral Commission]], the [[Bilderberg Group]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.globalresearch.ca/articles/CHO402A.html The Criminalization of the State] Michel Chossudovsky 3 February 2004&lt;/ref&gt; the [[European Union]], the [[United Nations]], the [[World Bank]], the [[International Monetary Fund]], [[Bohemian Grove]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Jane Kay |author2=Chronicle Environment Writer |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2009/07/06/MNUU18ICIV.DTL |title=San Francisco Bay Area |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=6 July 2009 |accessdate=3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Le Cercle]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Roberts |first=Andrew |title=The Green-Ink Brigade |url=http://www.literaryreview.co.uk/roberts_05_09.html |accessdate=15 June 2012 |newspaper=Literary Review |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824195542/http://www.literaryreview.co.uk/roberts_05_09.html |archivedate=24 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Yale University society [[Skull and Bones#Conspiracy theories|Skull and Bones]].

=== George Soros ===
Hungarian-American investor [[George Soros]] has been the subject of conspiracy theories since the 1990s. Soros has used his wealth to promote various political, social, educational and scientific causes, grants totaling an estimated $11 billion up to 2016.  However, theories tend to assert that Soros is in control of a large portion of the world's wealth and governments, and that he secretly funds a large range of persons and organizations for nefarious purposes, such as [[Antifa (United States)|Antifa]], which the conspiracies allege to be a single far-left militant group. Such ideas have been promoted by [[Donald Trump]],&lt;ref&gt;''Citations'':

[[Masonic conspiracy theories|Conspiracy theories concerning the Freemasons]] have proliferated since the 18th century.

One instance of promoting the "mastermind" conspiracy theory occurred in February 2017, when then-[[Ankara]] Mayor [[Melih Gökçek]] claimed that earthquakes in the western province of Çanakkale could have been organized by dark external powers aiming to destroy Turkey's economy with an "artificial earthquake" near Istanbul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/foreign-powers-performing-earthquake-tests-near-istanbul-to-destroy-economy-ankara-mayor.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=109436&amp;NewsCatID=341|title=Foreign powers performing 'earthquake tests' near Istanbul to destroy economy: Ankara mayor|date=7 February 2017|publisher=Hurriyet Daily News|accessdate=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another example, in November 2017, the [[Islamism|Islamist]] newspaper ''[[Yeni Akit]]'' claimed that the fashion trend of "ripped denim" jeans was in fact a means of communication, via specific forms of rips and holes, between agents of foreign states and their collaborators in Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/verschwoerungstheorie-in-der-tuerkei-geheimbotschaften-in-der-jeanshose/20637406.html|title=Geheimbotschaften in der Jeanshose|date=27 November 2017|publisher=tagesspiegel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Espionage ==
=== Israeli animal spying ===
Conspiracy theories exist alleging that [[Israel-related animal conspiracy theories|Israel uses animals]] to conduct espionage or to attack people.  These are often associated with conspiracy theories about [[Zionism]]. Matters of interest to theorists include a series of [[2010 Sharm el-Sheikh shark attacks|shark attacks in Egypt in 2010]], [[Hezbollah|Hezbollah's]] accusations of the use of "spying" eagles,&lt;ref name=Okbi&gt;{{cite news|last=Okbi|first=Yasser|title=Hezbollah: We have captured an Israeli 'spy eagle' in Lebanon|url=http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Hezbollah-We-have-captured-an-Israeli-spy-eagle-in-Lebanon-328880|work=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|date=16 October 2013|accessdate=27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2011 capture of a [[griffon vulture]] carrying an Israeli-labeled [[GPS wildlife tracking|satellite tracking device]].

=== Harold Wilson ===
Numerous persons, including former MI5 officer [[Peter Wright]] and Soviet defector [[Anatoliy Golitsyn]], have alleged that British Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson conspiracy theories|Harold Wilson was secretly a KGB spy]].

=== Malala Yousafzai ===
Conspiracy theories concerning [[Malala Yousafzai]] are widespread in [[Pakistan]], elements of which originate from a 2013 satirical piece in ''[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]''.  These theories variously allege that she is a Western spy, or that her attempted murder by the [[Taliban]] in 2012 was a secret operation to further discredit the Taliban, and was organized by her father and the CIA and carried out by actor [[Robert de Niro]] disguised as an [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]] [[homeopath]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/pakistan/9655417/Pakistani-Islamist-politician-claims-Malala-was-not-injured.html|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=5 November 2012|title=Pakistani Islamist politician claims Malala was not injured}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/d2f274b2-1de4-11e2-8e1d-00144feabdc0|work=Financial Times|date=24 October 2012|title=Pakistan thrives on conspiracy theory }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-29568637|publisher=BBC|date=10 October 2014|title=The antagonism towards Malala in Pakistan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity/malala-yousafzai-is-a-hero-to-many-but-has-few-fans-in-her-homeland-20170816-gxx8fo.html|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=18 August 2017|title=Malala Yousafzai is a hero to many, but has few fans in her homeland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal}}
Conspiracy theories have arisen in this case because of alleged inconsistencies in the evidence presented by the British government. One example is [[Craig Murray]]'s blog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2018/09/skripals-the-mystery-deepens/comment-page-1/#comments|title=Skripals - The Mystery Deepens - Craig Murray|author=|date=6 September 2018|website=craigmurray.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since at least the [[Middle Ages]], [[antisemitism]] has featured elements of conspiracy theory.  In medieval Europe it was widely believed that [[Jews]] poisoned wells, [[Jewish deicide|had been responsible for the death of Jesus]], and [[Blood libel|ritually consumed the blood of Christians]].  The second half of the 19th century saw the emergence of notions that Jews and/or [[Masonic conspiracy theories|Freemasons]] were plotting to establish control over the world. Forged evidence has been presented to spread the notion that [[Jewish Bolshevism|Jews were responsible for the propagation of Communism]], the most notorious example being ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' (1903).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/03/16/historys-greatest-conspiracy-theories/the-protocols-of-the-elders-of-zion/|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=19 November 2008|title=History's greatest conspiracy theories}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such antisemitic conspiracy theories became central to the worldview of [[Adolf Hitler]].

=== Bible and Jesus ===
[[Bible conspiracy theory|Bible conspiracy theories]] posit that significant parts of the [[New Testament]] are false, or have been omitted. Various groups both real (such as the [[Holy See|Vatican]]) and fake (such as the [[Priory of Sion]]) are said to suppress relevant information concerning, for example, the dating of the [[Turin Shroud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/03/16/historys-greatest-conspiracy-theories/the-jesus-conspiracy/|work=''The Daily Telegraph|date=19 November 2008|title=History's greatest conspiracy theories}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of this line of conspiracy theory has been stimulated by a debunked book titled ''[[The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail]]'' (1982), which claimed that [[Jesus]] and [[Mary Magdalene]] were lovers and that their offspring and descendants were secretly hidden in Europe following the death of Jesus, from whom the then-living French [[draughtsman]] [[Pierre Plantard]] claimed descent.  Interest in this hoax saw a resurgence following the publication of [[Dan Brown|Dan Brown's]] 2003 novel, ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[David Aaronovitch]]|title=Voodoo Histories: How Conspiracy Theory Has Shaped the Modern World|origyear=2009|year=2010|publisher=Vintage|pages=187–218, Chapter 6: Holy Blood, Holy Grail, Holy Shit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Islam ===
"[[War against Islam]]" is a conspiracy theory in [[Islamism|Islamist]] discourse which describes an alleged plot to either harm or annihilate the social system within [[Islam]]. The perpetrators of this conspiracy are alleged to be [[Kafir|non-Muslims]] and "[[Munafiq|false Muslims]]", allegedly in collusion with political actors in the Western world. The "War against Islam" theory is often used in order to refer to modern social problems and changes, but the [[Crusades]] are often seen as its starting point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wUcSDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA559|title=The Oxford Handbook of Islam and Politics|date=September 2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|author=John L.

{{see also|UFO conspiracy theory}}
Among the foremost concerns of conspiracy theorists are questions of alien life; for example, allegations of government cover-ups of the supposed [[Roswell UFO incident]] or activity at [[Area 51]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US base leads poll's top conspiracy theories|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/jul/31/1|date=31 July 2008|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also popular are theories concerning so-called '[[men in black]]', who allegedly silence witnesses.

[[Cattle mutilation|Many reports of dead cattle]] found with absent body parts and seemingly drained of blood have emerged worldwide since at least the 1960s.

== Government, politics and conflict ==
In the modern era, political conspiracy theories are often spread using [[fake news]] on social media. A 2017 study of fake news published by the [[Shorenstein Center]] found that "misinformation is currently predominantly a pathology of the right".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://shorensteincenter.org/combating-fake-news-agenda-for-research/|title=Combating Fake News: An Agenda for Research and Action - Shorenstein Center|date=2 May 2017|publisher=|accessdate=11 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political conspiracy theories may take generalized and wide-ranging forms concerning wars and international bodies, but may also be seen at a localized level, such as the conspiracy theory pertaining to the 118th Battalion, a British regiment stationed in [[Kitchener, Ontario]] during [[World War I]], which is believed by some in Kitchener to still be present and controlling local politics.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Johnstone Burpee, "The Oxford Encyclopedia of Canadian History," Oxford University Press, 1926, pg 477.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Illuminati ===
Conspiracy theories concerning the [[Illuminati]], a short-lived 18th-century [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] society, appear to have originated in the late 19th century, when some conservatives in Europe came to believe that the group had been responsible for the [[French Revolution]] of 1789–1799.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Aaronovitch|title=Voodoo Histories: How Conspiracy Theory Has Shaped the Modern World|origyear=2009|year=2010|publisher=Vintage|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hoaxes about the Illuminati were later spread in the 1960s by a group of American practical jokers known as the [[Discordianism|Discordians]], who, for example, wrote a series of fake letters about the Illuminati to ''[[Playboy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20170809-the-accidental-invention-of-the-illuminati-conspiracy|title=The Accidental Invention of the Illuminati Conspiracy|publisher=BBC|date=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[False flag]] operations are covert operations designed to appear as if they are being carried out by other entities. Some allegations of false flag operations have been verified or have been subjects of legitimate historical dispute (such as the 1933 [[Reichstag fire|Reichstag arson attack]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Telegraph |location=UK |date=15 April 2001 |title=Historians Find 'Proof' that Nazis Burnt Reichstag |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/1310995/Historians-find-proof-that-Nazis-burnt-Reichstag.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discussions of unsubstantiated allegations of such operations feature strongly in conspiracy theory discourse.

Such theories may feature claims that vaccines are part of a secret anti-Islam plot, and have been linked to fatal mass shootings and bombings at vaccine clinics in both countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2013/02/26/268358.html|title=Nigeria's polio campaign undermined by conspiracy theories|date=26 February 2013|publisher=Al Arabiya News Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/the-lay-scientist/2011/jul/15/1|title=Vaccines, the CIA, and how the War on Terror helped spread polio in Nigeria|date=15 July 2011|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/World/2013/1007/Pakistan-bomb-blast-why-health-workers-keep-getting-attacked|title=Pakistan bomb blast: why health workers keep getting attacked|date=7 October 2013|work=The Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Science and technology ==
=== Global warming ===
[[File:High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program site.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of the HAARP site, [[Alaska]]]]
[[Global warming conspiracy]] theorists typically allege that the science behind [[global warming]] has been invented or distorted for ideological or financial reasons.&lt;ref name="The Daily Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/03/16/historys-greatest-conspiracy-theories/|work=''The Daily Telegraph|date=19 November 2008|title=History's greatest conspiracy theories}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many have promoted such theories, including US President [[Donald Trump]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=After chilly forecast, Trump tweets U.S. 'could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming'|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/12/28/after-chilly-forecast-trump-tweets-u-s-could-use-a-little-bit-of-that-good-old-global-warming/|date=28 December 2017|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/03/hillary-clinton/yes-donald-trump-did-call-climate-change-chinese-h/|title=Yes, Donald Trump did call climate change a Chinese hoax|date=3 June 2016|accessdate=2 December 2016|publisher=[[PolitiFact.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; US Senator [[James Inhofe]],&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/feb/11/fiddling-with-global-warming-conspiracies-while-rome-burns|title=Fiddling with global warming conspiracy theories while Rome burns|date=11 February 2011|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; British journalist [[Christopher Booker]],&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt; and Viscount [[Christopher Monckton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2017/03/28/the-5-most-deranged-conspiracy-theories-from-gop-mega-donors-bizarro-climate-conference_partner/|title=The 5 most deranged conspiracy theories from GOP mega-donors' bizarro climate conference|date=29 March 2017|work=Salon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Weather and earthquake control projects ===
Numerous theories pertain to real or alleged weather-controlling projects.  Theories include the debunked assertion that [[High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program#Conspiracy theories|HAARP]], a radio-technology research program funded by the US government, is a secret weather-controlling system.  Some theorists have blamed 2005's [[Hurricane Katrina]] on HAARP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/illuminati-mind-control-hurricanes-conspiracy-theories-follow-haarp-1448711|work=International Business Times|date=30 July 2015|title=Illuminati, Mind Control and Hurricanes: Conspiracy Theories Follow HAARP}}&lt;/ref&gt;  HAARP has also been suggested to have somehow caused earthquakes, such as the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]], the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]] or the [[2013 Saravan earthquake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pappas|first1=Stephanie|title=Conspiracy Theories Abound as U.S. Military Closes HAARP|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/science/weird-science/conspiracy-theories-abound-u-s-military-closes-haarp-n112576|accessdate=29 November 2017|publisher=NBC News|date=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walia|first1=Arjun|title=Was Hugo Chavez Right About HAARP &amp; The Haiti Earthquake?

Also of interest to conspiracy theorists are [[cloud seeding|cloud-seeding technologies]].  These include a debunked allegation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weatheronline.co.uk/reports/philip-eden/Lynmouth-Flood-man-made.htm|title=The day they made it rain|first=Philip |last=Eden|publisher=WeatherOnline}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the British military's [[Project Cumulus]] caused the fatal 1952 [[Lynmouth Flood]] in Devon, England,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/aug/30/sillyseason.physicalsciences|title=RAF rainmakers 'caused 1952 flood'|work=The Guardian|date=30 August 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and claims concerning a secret project said to have caused the [[2010 Pakistan floods]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Aleem |last=Maqbool |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/9110766.stm |title=Is Pakistan in denial about tackling its problems? |publisher=BBC News |date=21 October 2010 |accessdate=15 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== MKUltra ===
[[MKUltra|Genuine American research in the 1950s and 1960s]] into chemical interrogation and mind-control techniques has prompted many subsequent conspiracy theories, especially following CIA Director Richard Helm's 1973 order to destroy all files related to the project.  These theories include the allegation that the mass fatality at [[Jonestown]] in 1978 was connected to an MKUltra experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/03/16/historys-greatest-conspiracy-theories/project-mk-ultra/|work=''The Daily Telegraph|date=19 November 2008|title=History's greatest conspiracy theories}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== RFID chips ===
[[RFID|Radio frequency identification chips]] (RFID), such as are implanted into pets as a means of tracking, have drawn the interest of conspiracy theorists who posit that this technology is secretly in widespread use on humans.  Former [[Whitby]] town councilor Simon Parkes has promoted this theory, which may be related to conspiracy theories concerning vaccination, electronic banking and the Antichrist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/weird/703856/MARK-OF-THE-BEAST-Secret-plan-to-implant-us-all-with-ID-chips-by-2017|title=MARK OF THE BEAST: Secret plan to 'implant us all with ID chips by 2017'|work=Daily Express|date=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/559949/Vladimir-Putin-Simon-Parkes-alien-Ukraine-Russia-Labour-councillor|title='Vladimir Putin is advised by ALIENS' Councillor blames space reptiles for Ukraine crisis|work=Daily Express|date=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flat Earth ===
[[File:Flat Earth Society Logo.png|thumb|120px|Logo of the Flat Earth Society, 2013]]
[[Flat earth|Flat Earth theory]] first emerged in 19th-century England, despite the Earth's spherical nature having been known since at least the time of [[Pythagoras]]. It has in recent years been promoted by American software consultant Mark Sargent through the use of [[YouTube]] videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why bad ideas refuse to die|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/jun/28/why-bad-ideas-refuse-die|date=28 June 2016|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flat-earther conspiracy theorists hold that planet Earth is not a sphere, and that evidence has been faked or suppressed to hide the fact that is instead a disc, or a single infinite [[plane (geometry)|plane]]. The conspiracy often implicates NASA.  Other claims may include such allegations as that [[GPS]] devices are rigged to make aircraft pilots wrongly believe they are flying around a globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Do they really think the earth is flat?|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7540427.stm|date=4 August 2008|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Flat Earth Society Says Evidence Of Round Planet Part Of Vast Conspiracy Theory|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/29/flat-earth-society-psychology_n_2038198.html|date=29 October 2012|work=HuffPost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technology suppression ===
Numerous theories pertain to the alleged suppression of certain technologies and energies.  Such theories may focus on the [[Vril|Vril Society Conspiracy]], allegations of the suppression of the [[electric car]] by fossil-fuel companies (as detailed in the 2006 documentary ''[[Who Killed the Electric Car?]]''), and the [[Phoebus cartel]], set up in 1924, which has been accused of suppressing longer-lasting light bulbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gaughen|first1=Patrick|title=Structural Inefficiency in the Early Twentieth Century: Studies in the Aluminum and Incadescent Lamp Markets|url=http://www.andover.edu/aep/papers/610/pgaughen98.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050224031701/http://www.andover.edu/aep/papers/610/pgaughen98.pdf|archivedate=24 February 2005|accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other long-standing allegations include the suppression of [[perpetual motion]] and [[cold fusion]] technology by government agencies, special interest groups, or fraudulent inventors.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;{{cite book |last=Tutt |first=Keith |title=The Scientist, The Madman, The Thief and Their Lightbulb: The Search for Free Energy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DMwSmB6_94QC |accessdate=23 March 2013 |year=2003 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster UK |location=UK |isbn=978-0684020907}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Promoters of alternative energy theories have included Thomas Henry Moray,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=B. King |first=Moray |title=The Energy Machine of T.

|via=Google Groups|accessdate=23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Weaponry ===
Conspiracy theorists often attend to new military technologies, both real and imagined.  Subjects of theories include: the alleged [[Philadelphia Experiment]], a supposed attempt to turn a U.S. Navy warship invisible;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vallée |first1=Jacques F |year=1994 |title=Anatomy of a Hoax: The Philadelphia Experiment Fifty Years Later |url=http://www.scientificexploration.org/journal/jse_08_1_vallee.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Journal of Scientific Exploration |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=47–71 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091222023540/http://www.scientificexploration.org/journal/jse_08_1_vallee.pdf |archivedate=22 December 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the alleged [[Montauk Project]], a supposed government program to learn about mind control and time travel; and the so-called [[Tsunami bomb]] which is alleged to have caused the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|2004 Indian Ocean tsunami]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/howaboutthat/3477148/The-greatest-conspiracy-theories-in-history.html?image=5|title = History's greatest conspiracy theories|website = The Telegraph|accessdate = 29 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other theories include Peter Vogel's debunked claim that an [[Port Chicago disaster#Debunked nuclear bomb theory|accidental explosion of conventional munitions at Port Chicago]] was in fact a nuclear detonation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Allen|first1=Robert|last2=Vogel|first2=Peter|title=America's Dark Secret: The Port Chicago Disaster|magazine=Nexus Magazine|date=June–July 1996|volume=3|issue=4|url=http://cruinthe.tripod.com/nexus/articles/portchicago.html|accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a theory promoted by the Venezuelan state-run TV station [[ViVe]] that the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]] was caused by a secret US "earthquake weapon".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,583588,00.html |title=Hugo Chavez Says U.S. Hit Haiti With 'Earthquake Weapon'|publisher=Fox News Channel|date=7 April 2010|accessdate=3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== False history ===
[[File:Silvester II.JPG|thumb|100px|[[Pope Sylvester II]] (from 999 to 1003)]]
Some theories claim that the dates of historical events have been deliberately distorted. These include the [[phantom time hypothesis]] of German conspiracy theorist Heribert Illig, who in 1991 published an allegation that 297 years had been added to the calendar by establishment figures such as [[Pope Sylvester II]] in order to position themselves at the [[Millennialism|millennium]].

A comparable theory, known as the [[New Chronology (Fomenko)|New Chronology]], is most closely associated with Russian theorist [[Anatoly Fomenko]].  Fomenko holds that history is many centuries shorter than is widely believed and that numerous historical documents have been fabricated, and legitimate documents destroyed, for political ends.  Adherents of such ideas have included chess grandmaster [[Garry Kasparov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1316610/King-Arthur-was-really-a-Russian-say-Slavs.html|title=King Arthur was really a Russian, say Slavs|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=19 April 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Space agencies ==
Scientific space programs are of particular interest to conspiracy theorists. The most prolific theories allege that [[Moon landing conspiracy theories|the US moon landings were staged by NASA in a film studio]], with some alleging the involvement of director [[Stanley Kubrick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/02/pop-culture-myths-friends-melania-nicki-minaj|title=Stunts! Bumps!

A more recent theory, emergent following the activities of [[computer hacker|hacker]] [[Gary McKinnon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19946902|title=Profile: Gary McKinnon|date=14 December 2012|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that a secret program of manned space fleets known as Solar Warden exists, supposedly acting under the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/hilarywardle/in-space-only-italian-radio-operators-can-hear-you-scream|title=16 Batshit Space Conspiracy Theories That Will Freak You The Fuck Out |date=1 March 2017|publisher=Buzzfeed News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nibiru (Planet X) ===
Conspiracy theorists have long posited a plot by organizations such as NASA to conceal the existence of a large planet in the [[Solar System]] known as [[Nibiru cataclysm|Nibiru]] or Planet X, which allegedly, will one day pass close enough to the Earth to destroy it.  Predictions for the date of destruction have included 2003, 2012 and 2017. The theory began to develop following the publication of ''The 12th Planet'' (1976), by discredited Russian-American author [[Zecharia Sitchin]], was given its full form by [[Nancy Lieder]], and has since been promoted by American conspiracy theorist and [[End Times]] theorist [[David Meade (author)|David Meade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The man whose biblical doomsday claim has some nervously eyeing Sept. 23|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2017/09/20/the-christian-numerologist-whose-biblical-doomsday-claim-has-some-nervously-eyeing-sept-23/|date=20 September 2017|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The notion has remained popular, and received renewed attention during the period prior to the [[solar eclipse of 21 August 2017]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Will 2017 solar eclipse cause secret planet 'Nibiru' to destroy Earth next month?

[[Boxing]] has featured in conspiracy theories, such as the claims that the second [[Muhammad Ali|Ali]]-[[Sonny Liston|Liston]] fight&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1622877-10-sports-conspiracy-theories-that-are-totally-true/page/2|title=10 Sports Conspiracy Theories That Are Totally True|author=Dan Carson|work=Bleacher Report|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first [[Timothy Bradley|Bradley]]-[[Manny Pacquiao|Pacquiao]] fight were fixed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1622877-10-sports-conspiracy-theories-that-are-totally-true/page/10|title=10 Sports Conspiracy Theories That Are Totally True|author=Dan Carson|work=Bleacher Report|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shergar ===
The notorious theft and disappearance of the Irish-bred racehorse [[Shergar]] in 1983 has prompted many conspiracy theorists to speculate about involvement by the [[Mafia]], the [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] and [[Colonel Gaddafi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/03/16/historys-greatest-conspiracy-theories/the-disappearance-of-shergar/|work=''The Daily Telegraph|date=19 November 2008|title=History's greatest conspiracy theories}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rigged selections processes ===
The "frozen envelope theory" suggests that the [[National Basketball Association]] rigged its 1985 draft Lottery so that [[Patrick Ewing]] would join the [[New York Knicks]]. Theorists claim that a lottery envelope was chilled so that it could be identified by touch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rEJp00sYu7AC&amp;pg=PA80&amp;lpg=PA80&amp;dq=frozen+envelope+theory |title=Books.google.com |publisher=Books.google.com |date= 1 June 2008|accessdate=3 August 2010|isbn=978-1-55652-707-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar "hot balls theory", promoted by Scottish football manager [[David Moyes]], suggests that certain balls used in draws for [[UEFA]] competitions have been warmed to achieve specific outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11671/7590220/moyes-uefa-hot-balls-cost-us|title=Moyes – UEFA hot balls cost us|work=SkySports|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1984 Pepsi 400 ===
The 1984 Pepsi 400 at [[Daytona International Speedway|Daytona]], Florida, was the first [[NASCAR]] race to be attended by a sitting US President, [[Ronald Reagan]], and was driver [[Richard Petty|Richard Petty's]] 200th victory.  Rival driver [[Cale Yarborough|Cale Yarborough's]] premature retirement to the [[pit stop|pit road]] has prompted conspiracy theorists to allege that organizers fixed the race in order to receive good publicity for the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/news/13-most-stunning-sports-conspiracy-140957968.html|title=The 13 most stunning sports conspiracy theories, ranked|work=Yahoo Sporting News|date=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ronaldo and the 1998 World Cup Final ===
On the day of the [[1998 World Cup Final]], Brazilian striker [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]] suffered a [[Epileptic seizure|convulsive fit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The great World Cup Final mystery|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/history/newsid_1749000/1749324.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=2 April 2002 |accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ronaldo was initially removed from the starting lineup 72 minutes before the match, with the teamsheet released to a stunned world media, before he was reinstated by the Brazil coach shortly before kick off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=World Cup moments: Mystery surrounds Ronaldo in 1998 |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/soccer/international/world-cup-moments-mystery-surrounds-ronaldo-in-1998-1.3494639 |accessdate=4 September 2018 |work=Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="France"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/may/08/world-cup-stunning-moments-25-ronaldo-france "World Cup: 25 stunning moments [...] No15: Ronaldo falters as France win"].

The Brazil coach insisted he had the final say, but much speculation focused on sportswear company [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], Brazil's multimillion-dollar sponsor—whom many Brazilians thought had too much control—putting pressure on the striker to play against medical advice.&lt;ref name="Paris"/&gt;

=== New England Patriots ===
{{see also|New England Patriots#Controversies}}

[[File:Denazification-street.jpg|thumb|upright|Adolf Hitler street sign being taken down in [[Trier]] during [[Denazification]]]]
This is a partial list of streets and squares named after [[Adolf Hitler]] during the era of [[Nazi Germany]].

The zeal with which German municipal authorities attempted,{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} immediately after the [[Machtergreifung|seizure of power]], to play their part in the "National Rising" ({{lang-de|Nationale Erhebung}}) is shown by the practice of conferring honorary municipal citizenship on Hitler, and even more by naming a street (''Straße''), a square or place (''Platz''), a promenade (''Anlage''), an avenue (''Damm'', ''Allee''), a stadium (''Kampfbahn''), or a bridge (''Brücke'') after the new chancellor.  As early as March and April 1933, a wave of renamings swept through Germany's cities.  Most of the examples in the list come from this period.

==Brazil==
Before 1931, there are records of a street named Rua Adolpho Hitler in the [[Campo Belo (district of São Paulo)|Campo Belo]] district of Santo Amaro, [[Brazil]]. Its name was changed in 1931 to Rua Almirante Barroso, but when Santo Amaro was merged into [[São Paulo]] on the next year, the street was again renamed to Rua Gil Eanes, due to a homonym street in [[Brás (district of São Paulo)|Brás]]. The street still retains Gil Eanes’s name.&lt;ref name=SaoPaulo&gt;{{cite web|title=A Rua Adolf Hitler e outras ruas de alemães que mudaram de nome em São Paulo|url=http://www.saopauloantiga.com.br/rua-adolf-hitler/|website=saopauloantiga.com.br|publisher=São Paulo Antiga/Douglas Nascimento|language=pt|accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lucinda Banister Chandler''' (April 1, 1828 - 1911) was an American social reformer and author. She was a leader in the [[social purity movement]]. She was affiliated with [[Elizabeth Boynton Harbert]].{{sfn|Satter|2001|p=195}}

==Early years and education==
Lucinda Banister was born in [[Potsdam, New York]], April 1, 1828. Her parents were Silas Banister and Eliza Smith, both of [[New England]] birth and ancestry.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=165}}   

Chandler suffered a spinal injury in early infancy from a fall, which caused a life of invalidism and extreme suffering. As a child, she was fond of books and study, and when she entered St. Lawrence Academy (now, [[State University of New York at Potsdam]]), at nine years of age, her teacher registered her as two years older, because of her advancement in studies and seeming maturity of years. At the age of 13, her first great disappointment came, when her school course was suspended, never to be resumed, by the severe development of her spinal malady. For several years, even reading was denied to her.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=165}}  

==Career==
In the winter of 1870-71, she wrote "Motherhood, Its Power Over Human Destiny," while recuperating from a long illness, and it was so warmly received in [[Vineland, New Jersey]], that it was afterwards published in booklet form. That introduced her to many thinking women of [[Boston]], where in 1871-72, she held parlor meetings and organized a body of women who were pledged to work for the promotion of enlightened parenthood as well as an equal and high standard of purity for both sexes: the Moral Education Society of Boston. Societies were formed in [[New York City]], [[Philadelphia]] and [[Washington, D.C.]], by the efforts of Chandler and with the cooperation of prominent women. That was the first work in this country in the line of educational standards for the elevation and purity of the relations of men and women, inside as well as outside of marriage. The publication of essays, "A Mother's Aid, "Children's Rights" and the "Divineness of Marriage," written by her, followed and furnished a literature for the agitation of questions that later were widely discussed.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=165}}  

During one of the long periods of prostration and confinement to her room, to which Chandler was subject, she commenced study on the lines of political economy as a mental tonic and helpful agency to restoration. After her recovery, she wrote extensively for reform publications upon finance reform, the land question and industrial problems. In [[Chicago]], in 1880, the Margaret Fuller Society was founded, especially to interest women in those subjects and the principles of [[Americanism (ideology)|Americanism]].{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=165}}   

A lifelong advocate of the total abstinence principle, Chandler served as vice-president of the Woman's Christian Temperance Alliance of [[Illinois]]. She was the first president of the Chicago Moral Educational Society, formed in 1882. She was an advocate of Christian socialism, and a firm believer in the final triumph of the Christian idea of the brotherhood of man as a practical and controlling principle in commercial and industrial systems.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=165}} 

==Personal life==
At the age of 20, she married John H. Chandler, who was born and raised in [[Potsdam]].{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=165}} He was a carpenter and joiner by trade. He was also a music teacher and gave musicalconcerts and instruction in music. Their only child was John Nelson who drowned at the age of four years.{{sfn|Chandler|1883|p=945}}

Chandler's marriage was a happy one. Her husband's care made it possible for her to enjoy a period of usefulness in later life.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=165}} Chandler died in 1911.{{sfn|Gordon|2009|p=73}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2604">'''Making Sense of Abstinence''' is a collection of 16 lessons for teaching about [[sexual abstinence]] in the context of comprehensive [[sexuality education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://getthefactsny.org/educators/documents/NewMakingSenseFlyer.pdf|title=Empire State Acts|website=Getthefactsny.org|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the Minnesota Organization on Adolescent Pregnancy, Prevention, and Parenting, it is "a [[curriculum]] that takes [[abstinence]] beyond a one-dimensional scope of 'just say no,'...[utilizing] positive and engaging activities to help young people think about [[abstinence]] in a way that values their ability to make decisions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moappp.org/Documents/MakingSenseAbstinence.pdf|format=PDF|title=Making Sense of Abstinence : Lessons for Comprehensive Sexuality Education|website=Moappp.org|date=February 8, 2006|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sample lessons include such titles as "So What's An Abstinence Anyway?" "Hey, Mom?  Hey, Dad? Hey...Gram?  Can We Talk about Abstinence?" "Just Say Know," "Masturbation:  A Touchy Subject," "Handling Horny," and "Some Day:  Making the Transition from Sexual Abstinence".

The manual has received praise from sexuality educators for expanding the way [[sexuality education]] teaches about abstinence, and for teaching the subject in a positive way, unlike other fear-based approaches.  For example, the online journal "Sexual Intelligence" praised "Making Sense of Abstinence" for "not treating kids like robotic idiots."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sexualintelligence.org/newsletters/issue71.html#four|title=Sexual Intelligence by Marty Klein, Ph.D.|website=Sexualintelligence.org|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abstinence-only]] advocates have criticized the manual for including such topics as [[outercourse]] and [[masturbation]], behaviors they believe should not be acknowledged.  Critics also claim that teenagers should not learn information to protect themselves when their abstinence decisions change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faithandfreedom.us/pdf/abstinence_ed.pdf|format=PDF|title=Faith and Freedom|website=Faithandfreedom.us|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors of "Making Sense of Abstinence" state that neither the "Just say no" approach, nor the "Always say yes," is appropriate for abstinence education.  Rather, they emphasize that teens need complete information to help them make the best decisions for themselves.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22681">'''Mobilities''' is a contemporary [[paradigm]] in the [[social science]]s that explores the movement of people ([[Human migration]], [[travel]], [[transport]]), ideas (see e.g. [[meme]]) and things (transport), as well as the broader social implications of those movements.

A mobility "turn" (or transformation) in the social sciences began in the 1990s in response to the increasing realization of the historic and contemporary importance of movement on individuals and society. This turn has been driven by generally increased levels of mobility and new forms of mobility where bodies combine with information and different patterns of mobility. The mobilities paradigm incorporates new ways of theorizing about how these mobilities lie "at the center of constellations of power, the creation of identities and the microgeographies of everyday life." ([[Tim Cresswell|Cresswell]], 2011, 551)

The mobility turn arose as a response to the way in which the social sciences had traditionally been static, seeing movement as a [[black box]] and ignoring or trivializing "the importance of the systematic movements of people for work and family life, for leisure and pleasure, and for politics and protest" (Sheller and Urry, 2006, 208). Mobilities emerged as a critique of contradictory orientations toward both [[sedentary lifestyle|sedentarism]] and deterritorialisation in social science. People had often been seen as static entities tied to specific places, or as [[nomad]]ic and placeless in a frenetic and [[globalization|globalized]] existence. Mobilities looks at movements and the forces that drive, constrain and are produced by those movements.

Several typologies have been formulated to clarify the wide variety of mobilities. Most notably, John Urry&lt;ref&gt;Urry, J. 2000 Sociology Beyond Societies: Mobilities for the Twenty-First Century. London:  Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Urry, J., 2007. Mobilities. Cambridge: Polity.&lt;/ref&gt; divides mobilities into five types: mobility of objects, corporeal mobility, imaginative mobility, virtual mobility and communicative mobility. Later, Leopoldina Fortunati and Sakari Taipale&lt;ref&gt;Fortunati, L. &amp; Taipale, S. 2017. Mobilities and the Network of Personal Technologies: Refining the Understanding of Mobility Structure. Telematics and Informatics, 34(2), 560–568. https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tele.2016.09.011 &lt;/ref&gt; proposed an alternative typology taking the individual and the human body as a point of reference. They differentiate between ‘macro-mobilities’ (consistent physical displacements), ‘micro-mobilities’ (small-scale displacements), ‘media mobility’ (mobility added to the traditionally fixed forms of media) and ‘disembodied mobility’ (the transformation in the social order). The categories are typically considered interrelated, and therefore they are not exclusive.&lt;ref&gt;Taipale, S. 2013. Mobilities in Finland’s Information Society Strategies from 1995 to 2010, Mobilities, 8(2), 293-311. https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17450101.2012.655975 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taipale, S. 2014. The dimensions of mobilities: The spatial relationships between corporeal and digital mobilities. Social Science Research 43C, 157-167, https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2013.10.003&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==

While mobilities is commonly associated with [[sociology]], contributions to the mobilities literature have come from scholars in [[anthropology]], [[cultural studies]], [[economics]], [[geography]], [[migration studies]], [[science and technology studies]], and [[tourism geography|tourism]] and [[transport]] studies. (Sheller and Urry, 2006, 207)

Mobilities as a specific body of research remains associated with a small group of largely British researchers, notably [[John Urry (sociologist)|John Urry]], [[Mimi Sheller]], Peter Adey, Tim Edensor, David Bissell, and [[Tim Cresswell]]. However, Cresswell (2011, 555) notes that "many people involved in research on mobility topics do not see themselves as part of a new paradigm or turn" (e.g. [[Noel B. Salazar]]). The community of mobilities researchers, as well as the areas they research, have expanded across the globe.

The eponymous journal ''Mobilities'' provides a list of typical subjects which have been explored in the mobilities paradigm (Taylor and Francis, 2011):
* Mobile spatiality and temporality
* [[sustainable mobility|Sustainable]] and alternative mobilities
* Mobile rights and risks
* New [[social networks]] and [[mobile media]]
* Immobilities and [[social exclusion]]s
* [[Tourism]] and [[travel]] mobilities
* [[Human migration|Migration]] and [[diaspora]]s
* [[Transportation]] and [[communication technologies]]
* Transitions in complex systems

==Origins==

Sheller and Urry (2006, 215) place mobilities in the sociological tradition by defining the primordial theorist of mobilities as [[Georg Simmel]] (1858–1918). Simmel's essays, "Bridge and Door" (Simmel, 1909 / 1994) and "The Metropolis and Mental Life" (Simmel, 1903 / 2001) identify a uniquely human will to connection, as well as the urban demands of tempo and precision that are satisfied with mobility.

The more immediate precursors of contemporary mobilities research emerged in the 1990s (Cresswell 2011, 551). Historian [[James Clifford (historian)|James Clifford]] (1997) advocated for a shift from deep analysis of particular places to the routes connecting them. [[Marc Augé]] (1995) considered the philosophical potential of an anthropology of "non-places" like [[airport]]s and [[motorway]]s that are characterized by constant transition and temporality. Sociologist [[Manuel Castells]] outlined a "network society" and suggested that the "space of places" is being surpassed by a "space of flows." Feminist scholar [[Caren Kaplan]] (1996) explored questions about the gendering of metaphors of travel in social and cultural theory.

The contemporary paradigm under the moniker "mobilities" appears to originate with the work of sociologist [[John Urry (sociologist)|John Urry]]. In his book, ''Sociology Beyond Societies: Mobilities for the Twenty-First Century'', Urry (2000, 1) presents a "manifesto for a sociology that examines the diverse mobilities of peoples, objects, images, information and wastes; and of the complex interdependencies between, and social consequences of, these diverse mobilities."

This is consistent with the aims and scope of the eponymous journal ''Mobilities'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rmob20/current#.VKZE_ZOZE_Y ''Mobilities''] ({{ISSN|1745-0101}} (print), {{ISSN|1745-011X}} (online))&lt;/ref&gt; which "examines both the large-scale movements of people, objects, capital, and information across the world, as well as more local processes of daily transportation, movement through public and private spaces, and the travel of material things in everyday life" (Taylor and Francis, 2011).

In 2006, Mimi Sheller and John Urry published an oft-cited paper that examined the mobilities paradigm as it was just emerging, exploring its motivations, theoretical underpinnings, and methodologies. Sheller and Urry specifically focused on [[automobility]] as a powerful socio-technical system that "impacts not only on local [[public space]]s and opportunities for coming together, but also on the formation of gendered subjectivities, familial and social networks, spatially segregated urban neighborhoods, national images and aspirations to modernity, and global relations ranging from transnational migration to terrorism and [[oil war]]s" (Sheller and Urry, 2006, 209).

Mobilities can be viewed as an extension of the "[[spatial turn]]" in the arts and sciences in the 1980s, in which scholars began "to interpret space and the spatiality of human life with the same critical insight and interpretive power as have traditionally been given to time and history (the historicality of human life) on one hand, and to social relations and society (the sociality of human life) on the other" (Sheller and Urry, 2006, 216; Engel and Nugent, 2010, 1; Soja, 1999 / 2005, 261).

Engel and Nugent (2010) trace the conceptual roots of the spatial turn to [[Ernst Cassirer]] and [[Henri Lefebvre]] (1974), although [[Fredric Jameson]] appears to have coined the epochal usage of the term for the 1980s paradigm shift. Jameson (1988 / 2003, 154) notes that the concept of the spatial turn "has often seemed to offer one of the more productive ways of distinguishing postmodernism from modernism proper, whose experience of temporality -- existential time, along with deep memory -- it is henceforth conventional to see as dominant of the high modern."

For Oswin &amp; Yeoh (2010) mobility seems to be inextricably intertwined with late-modernity and the end of the nation-state. The sense of mobility makes us to think in migratory and tourist fluxes as well as the necessary infrastructure for that displacement takes place.&lt;ref&gt;Oswin, N. Y., Yeoh, B. "Introduction: Mobile City Singapore". ''Mobilities'' Vol. 5 (2), 2010, pp. 167-175.&lt;/ref&gt; R. Tzanelli (2014) explains that modernity has recycled the human emotions, particularly trauma, whatever their cause may be, to generate a logic of spectacle.  Any mediated and consumed event not only destroys the previous states of conflicts and cleavages, but provides a one-sided ideological message to visitors. Tourism is for Tzanelli more than a mechanism to control, it is an instrument of [[ideology]]. The efficacy for state to reduce the discrepancy and discontent of citizenry consists in commoditizing the human suffering into affordable products.&lt;ref&gt;Tzanelli, R. (2014). "Embodied art and aesthetic performativity in the London 2012 handover to Rio (2016)". ''Global Studies Journal'', 6(2), 13-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

P. Vannini (2012) opted to see mobility as a projection of existent cultural values, expectances and structures that denotes styles of life. Mobility after all would not only generate effects on people's behaviour but also specific styles of life. Vannini explains convincingly that on [[Canada]]'s coast, the values of islanders defy the hierarchal order in populated cities from many perspectives. Islanders prioritize the social cohesion and trust of their communities before the alienation of mega-cities. There is a clear physical isolation that marks the boundaries between urbanity and rurality. From another view, nonetheless, this ideological dichotomy between authenticity and alienation leads residents to commercialize their spaces to outsiders. Although the tourism industry is adopted in these communities as a form of activity, many locals have historically migrated from urban populated cities.&lt;ref&gt;Vannini, P. (2012). ''Ferry Tales: Mobility, places and time on Canada's West Coast''. New York, [[Routledge]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mobilities and transportation geography==

The intellectual roots of mobilities in sociology distinguish it from traditional transportation studies and [[transportation geography]], which have firmer roots in mid 20th century [[Positivism|positivist]] spatial science.

Cresswell (2011, 551) presents six characteristics distinguishing mobilities from prior approaches to the study of migration or transport:

* Mobilities often links science and social science to the [[humanities]].
* Mobilities often links across different scales of movement, while traditional transportation geography tends to focus on particular forms of movement at only one scale (such as local traffic studies or household travel surveys).
* Mobilities encompasses the movement of people, objects, and ideas, rather than narrowly focusing on areas like passenger [[modal shift]] or [[freight logistics]].
* Mobilities considers both motion and "stopping, stillness and relative immobility."
* Mobilities incorporates mobile theorization and methodologies to avoid the privileging of "notions of boundedness and the sedentary."
* Mobilities often embraces the political and differential politics of mobility, as opposed to the apolitical, "objective" stance often sought by researchers associated with engineering disciplines

Mobilities can be seen as a postmodern descendant of modernist [[transportation studies]], with the influence of the spatial turn corresponding to a "[[post-structuralist]] agnosticism about both naturalistic and universal explanations and about single-voiced historical narratives, and to the concomitant recognition that position and context are centrally and inescapably implicated in all constructions of knowledge" (Cosgrove, 1999, 7; Warf and Arias, 2009).

Despite these [[ontological]] and [[epistemological]] differences, Shaw and Hesse (2010, 207) have argued that mobilities and transport geography represent points on a continuum rather than incompatible extremes. Indeed, traditional transport geography has not been wholly quantitative any more than mobilities is wholly qualitative. Sociological explorations of mobility can incorporate empirical techniques, while model-based inquiries can be tempered with richer understandings of the meanings, representations and assumptions inherently embedded in models.

Shaw and Sidaway (2010, 505) argue that even as research in the mobilities paradigm has attempted to reengage transportation and the social sciences, mobilities shares a fate similar to traditional transportation geography in still remaining outside the mainstream of the broader academic geographic community.

==Theoretical underpinnings of Mobilities==

Sheller and Urry (2006, 215-217) presented six bodies of theory underpinning the mobilities paradigm:

The prime theoretical foundation of mobilities is the work of early 20th-century sociologist [[Georg Simmel]], who identified a uniquely human "will to connection," and provided a theoretical connection between mobility and materiality. Simmel focused on the increased tempo of [[urban sociology|urban life]], that "drives not only its social, economic, and [[urban infrastructure|infrastructural]] formations, but also the psychic forms of the urban dweller." Along with this tempo comes a need for precision in timing and location in order to prevent chaos, which results in [[complexity|complex]] and novel systems of relationships.

A second body of theory comes from the science and technology studies which look at mobile sociotechnical systems that incorporate hybrid geographies of human and nonhuman components. [[Automobile]], [[rail transport|rail]] or [[air transport]] systems involve complex [[transport network]]s that affect society and are affected by society. These networks can have dynamic and enduring parts. Non-transport information networks can also have unpredictable effects on encouraging or suppressing physical mobility (Pellegrino 2012).

A third body of theory comes from the [[postmodern]] conception of [[spatiality]], with the substance of places being constantly in [[Motion (physics)|motion]] and subject to constant reassembly and reconfiguration (Thrift 1996).

A fourth body of theory is a "recentring of the corporeal body as an affective vehicle through which we sense place and movement, and construct emotional geographies". For example, the car is "experienced through a combination of senses and sensed through multiple registers of motion and emotion″ (Sheller and Urry 2006, 216).

A fifth body of theory incorporates how [[topologies]] of social networks relate to how complex [[pattern formation|patterns form and change]]. Contemporary information technologies and ways of life often create broad but weak social ties across time and space, with [[interpersonal relationships|social life]] incorporating fewer chance meetings and more networked connections.

Finally, the last body of theory is the analysis of complex transportation systems that are "neither perfectly ordered nor anarchic." For example, the rigid spatial coupling, operational timings, and historical bindings of rail contrast with unpredictable environmental conditions and ever-shifting political winds. And, yet, "change through the accumulation of small repetitions...could conceivably tip the [[car dependence|car system]] into the [[car-free movement|postcar system]]."

==Mobilities methodologies==

Mimi Sheller and John Urry (2006, 217-219) presented seven methodological areas often covered in mobilities research:

* Analysis of the patterning, timing and causation of face-to-face co-presence
* Mobile [[ethnography]] - participation in patterns of movement while conducting ethnographic research
* Time-space diaries - subjects record what they are doing, at what times and in what places
* Cyber-research - exploration of virtual mobilities through various forms of electronic connectivity
* Study of experiences and feelings
* Study of memory and private worlds via photographs, letters, images and souvenirs
* Study of in-between places and transfer points like lounges, waiting rooms, cafes, amusement arcades, parks, hotels, airports, stations, motels, harbors

'''Networked individualism''' represents the shift of the classical model of social arrangements formed around hierarchical bureaucracies or social groups that are tightly-knit, like households and work groups, to connected ''individuals'', using the means provided by the evolution of [[Information and communications technology]]. Although the turn to networked individualism started before the advent of the internet, it has been fostered by the development of social media networks.

==Origin of the term==
The term was coined by Barry Wellman in 2000,&lt;ref&gt;Barry Wellman, “Living Wired in a Networked World: The Rise of Networked Individualism.” Founding conference, Association of Internet Researchers, Lawrence, KS, Sept 2000&lt;/ref&gt; and first published by Manuel Castells and Barry Wellman in 2001.&lt;ref name="castells"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Manuel|first=Castells|date=2001|year=2001|title=The Internet Galaxy: Reflections on the Internet, Business and Society|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Internet-Galaxy-Reflections-Clarendon-Management/dp/0199255776|journal=Oxford University Press|volume=|issue=|pages=132|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barry Wellman, “Physical Place and Cyber Place: The Rise of Networked Individualism.” ''International Journal of Urban and Regional Research'' 25,2 (June, 2001): 227-52.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was elaborated on by Lee Rainie and [[Barry Wellman]] in their 2012 book ''Networked: The New Social Operating System'' (MIT Press).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Networked: The New Social Operating System|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bYJGna0AhdAC|publisher = MIT Press|date = 2012-04-27|isbn = 9780262300407|first = Lee|last = Rainie|first2 = Barry|last2 = Wellman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The networked individuals are members of diverse groups in which they seek different things; for instance, the same set of individuals could be in a group used to seek emotional support while another group might be used to get good addresses in a city. Those groups can be dispersed around the globe, and the combination of those networks make for a highly individualized, and well-networked, person.&lt;ref name="castells"/&gt;

This new world of networked individualism is oriented around looser, more fragmented networks that provide on-demand succor. Such networks had already formed before the coming of the internet.  In incorporating the internet and mobile phones into their lives, people have changed the ways they interact with each other. They have become increasingly networked as individuals, rather than embedded in groups. In the world of networked individuals, it is the person who is the focus; more than the family, the work unit, the neighborhood, and the social group.&lt;ref name="pewinternet"&gt;{{cite web|author=Rainie, Lee and Wellman, Barry|title=Networked individualism: What in the world is that?|url=http://networked.pewinternet.org/2012/05/24/networked-individualism-what-in-the-world-is-that-2/|publisher=pewinternet.org|accessdate=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications for the future of society==
Social relationships are changing, and technology is a driving force in many of these changes. There are some fears that the digital technologies are killing society, but studies by the [http://pewinternet.org/ Pew Internet Project] show that these technologies are not isolated — or isolating — systems. They are being incorporated into people’s social lives much like their predecessors were.&lt;ref name="pewinternet"/&gt;

Barry Wellman questioned the future of networked individualism after the event of the [[September 11 attacks]] in his short essay,''The Rise (and Possible Fall) of Networked Individualism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Wellman, Barry|title=''The Rise (and Possible Fall) of Networked Individualism''|url=http://www.insna.org/PDF/Connections/v24/2001_I-3-4.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Insna.org|accessdate=2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''open house''' (also known as '''open day''' and '''at-home day''') is an event held at an institution where its doors are open to the general public to allow people to look around the institution and learn about it. These are often held at [[schools]] and [[universities]] to attract prospective students, familiarize them (and their parents) with the facilities, allow new students to become familiar with facilities and meet others, or to open informal communication channels between school staff and the students and their parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open day|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/open-day|website=Collins English Dictionary - Complete &amp; Unabridged 10th Edition.|publisher=HarperCollins|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Open houses in American schools==

&lt;blockquote&gt;
School open houses are about two hours long, the length of a good movie or show . . . a well-executed event sets the stage for a successful [[school year]]. The face-to-face meetings with families help build relationships, increase the visibility of the parent group, and develop a [[sense of community]] at school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Contrary to what its name might seem to imply, an open house at the average school is not intended for general members of the public, but rather, specifically, for the parents and family members of the students who either attend or are considering attending a school. In the overwhelming majority of [[Education in the United States|schools in the United States]], open house is held once a year, typically in the first month or first quarter of the [[school year]]. It is common for open houses to be held in the evenings or weekends, to allow for parents who work during the standard the [[work-week]] hours to attend, but holding open house in the daytime is not unusual, especially at elementary schools.

===Elementary schools===
In [[elementary schools]], open houses often have no schedule; parents come and go during the scheduled hours as they please, and some teachers may be willing to discuss individual students' progress with their parents. Some schools may schedule displays of [[school activities]], such as a performance by a [[Children's Choir|student choir]].

===Secondary schools===
In [[secondary schools]]—divided into [[middle schools]] (also called junior high schools) and [[high schools]] (also called senior high schools)—the single most important purpose of the open house is to allow parents and teachers meet each other face-to-face. In many middle schools and high schools, parents are given a schedule, often the same schedule their child follows during the school day. The parents go from one class to another, in the sequence that their child attends them, usually in the very same classrooms. Typically in such open houses the parents have only 5–15 minutes with their child's teacher, which provides time for the teacher to explain their class expectations, but not enough time to discuss individual children.

Dover|title=Greek Homosexuality|date=1989|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0674362616|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''Pederasty in ancient Greece''' was a socially acknowledged romantic relationship between an adult male (the ''erastes'') and a younger male (the ''eromenos'') usually in his teens.&lt;ref&gt;C.D.C. Reeve, ''Plato on Love:'' Lysis, Symposium, Phaedrus, Alcibiades ''with Selections from'' Republic'' and'' Laws (Hackett, 2006), p. xxi [https://books.google.com/books?id=E1lQNf2EfEUC&amp;pg=PP25 online]; Martti Nissinen, ''Homoeroticism in the Biblical World: A Historical Perspective'', translated by Kirsi Stjerna (Augsburg Fortress, 1998, 2004), p. 57 [https://books.google.com/books?id=-sHSNPG85tUC&amp;pg=PA57 online]; Nigel Blake ''et al.'', ''Education in an Age of Nihilism'' (Routledge, 2000), p. 183 [https://books.google.com/books?id=lgkOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA183 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; It was characteristic of the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic]] and [[Classical Greece|Classical periods]].&lt;ref&gt;Nissinen,  ''Homoeroticism in the Biblical World'', p. 57; William Armstrong Percy III, "Reconsiderations about Greek Homosexualities," in ''Same–Sex Desire and Love in Greco-Roman Antiquity and in the Classical Tradition of the West'' (Binghamton: Haworth, 2005), p. 17. Sexual variety, not excluding ''paiderastia'', was characteristic of the [[Hellenistic era]]; see [[Peter Green (historian)|Peter Green]], "Sex and Classical Literature," in ''Classical Bearings: Interpreting Ancient Culture and History'' (University of California Press, 1989, 1998), p. 146 [https://books.google.com/books?id=zlFXc9N19yUC&amp;pg=PA146 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of pederasty on Greek culture of these periods was so pervasive that it has been called "the principal cultural model for free relationships between citizens."&lt;ref&gt;Dawson, ''Cities of the Gods'', p. 193. See also George Boys-Stones, "Eros in Government: Zeno and the Virtuous City," ''Classical Quarterly'' 48 (1998), 168–174: "there is a certain kind of sexual relationship which was considered by many Greeks to be very important for the cohesion of the city: sexual relations between men and youths. Such relationships were taken to play such an important role in fostering cohesion where it mattered — among the male population — that [[Lycurgus of Sparta|Lycurgus]] even gave them official recognition in his constitution for Sparta" (p. 169).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars locate its origin in [[initiation ritual]], particularly rites of passage on [[Crete]], where it was associated with entrance into military life and the religion of [[Zeus]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert B. Koehl, "The Chieftain Cup and a Minoan Rite of Passage," ''Journal of Hellenic Studies'' 106 (1986) 99–110, with a survey of the relevant scholarship including that of [[Arthur Evans]] (p. 100) and others such as H. Jeanmaire and R.F. Willetts (pp. 104–105); Deborah Kamen, "The Life Cycle in Archaic Greece," in The Cambridge Companion to Archaic Greece (Cambridge University Press, 2007), pp. 91–92. [[Kenneth Dover]], a pioneer in the study of Greek homosexuality, rejects the initiation theory of origin; see  "Greek Homosexuality and Initiation," in ''Que(e)rying Religion: A Critical Anthology'' (Continuum, 1997), pp. 19–38. For Dover, it seems, the argument that Greek ''paiderastia'' as a social custom was related to rites of passage constitutes a denial of homosexuality as natural or innate; this may be to overstate or misrepresent what the initiatory theorists have said. The initiatory theory claims to account not for the existence of ancient Greek homosexuality in general but rather for that of formal ''paiderastia''.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has no formal existence in the [[Homeric epics]], and seems to have developed in the late 7th century BC as an aspect of Greek [[homosociality|homosocial culture]],&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hubbard, "Pindar's ''Tenth Olympian'' and Athlete-Trainer Pederasty," in ''Same–Sex Desire and Love in Greco-Roman Antiquity'', pp. 143 and 163 (note 37), with cautions about the term "homosocial" from Percy, p. 49, note 5.&lt;/ref&gt; which was characterized also by [[Nudity in sport|athletic]] and [[Depictions of nudity|artistic nudity]], delayed marriage for aristocrats, [[symposium|symposia]], and the social seclusion of women.&lt;ref&gt;Percy, "Reconsiderations about Greek Homosexualities," p. 17 [https://books.google.com/books?id=ejPZu3Ktu5cC&amp;pg=PA17 online] ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;
Pederasty was both idealized and criticized in [[ancient Greek literature|ancient literature]] and [[Greek philosophy|philosophy]].&lt;!--this is a point too fundamental to cite fully here; it will be discussed at length in a section--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For examples, see Kenneth Dover, ''Greek Homosexuality'' (Harvard University Press, 1978, 1989), p. 165, note 18, where the eschatological value of ''paiderastia'' for the soul in Plato is noted.  For a more cynical view of the custom, see the comedies of Aristophanes, e.g. ''Wealth'' 149-59. Paul Gilabert Barberà, "John Addington Symonds. ''A Problem in Greek Ethics''. Plutarch's ''Eroticus'' Quoted Only in Some Footnotes? Why?" in ''The Statesman in Plutarch's Works'' (Brill, 2004), p. 303 [https://books.google.com/books?id=cruTUAFuWWMC&amp;pg=PA303 online]; and the pioneering view of [[Havelock Ellis]], ''Studies in the Psychology of Sex'' (Philadelphia: F.A. Davis, 1921, 3rd ed.), vol. 2, p. 12 [https://books.google.com/books?id=-tgTAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA12 online.] For [[Stoicism|Stoic]] "utopian" views of ''paiderastia'', see Doyne Dawson, ''Cities of the Gods: Communist Utopias in Greek Thought'' (Oxford University Press, 1992), p. 192 [https://books.google.com/books?id=HwsWp43OWjsC&amp;pg=PA192 online.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The argument has recently been made that idealization was universal in the Archaic period; criticism began in Athens as part of the general Classical Athenian reassessment of Archaic culture.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Andrew Lear]], 'Was pederasty problematized?  ''A diachronic view' in Sex in Antiquity:  exploring gender and sexuality in the ancient world'', eds. Mark Masterson, Nancy Rabinowitz, and James Robson (Routledge, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have debated the role or extent of pederasty, which is likely to have varied according to local custom and individual inclination.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Lambert, "Athens," in ''Gay Histories and Cultures: An Encyclopedia'' (Taylor &amp; Francis, 2000), p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; The English word "[[pederasty]]" in present-day usage might imply the [[Laws regarding child sexual abuse|abuse]] of [[minor (law)|minors]] in certain jurisdictions, but [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] law, for instance, recognized [[Consent (criminal law)|consent]] but not [[Age of consent|age]] as a factor in regulating sexual behavior.&lt;ref&gt;See Osborne following. Gloria Ferrari, however, notes that there were conventions of age pertaining to sexual activity, and if a man violated these by seducing a boy who was too young to consent to becoming an ''eromenos'', the [[sexual predator|predator]] might be subject to prosecution under the law of ''[[hubris]]''; ''Figures of Speech: Men and Maidens in Ancient Greece'' (University of Chicago Press, 2002), pp. 139–140.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
[[File:Kouros anavissos.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Kouros]]'' representing an idealized youth, c.&amp;nbsp;530 BC]]The Greek word ''paiderastia'' ({{lang|grc|παιδεραστία}}) is an [[abstract noun]]. It is formed from ''paiderastês'', which in turn is a compound of ''pais'' ("child", plural ''paides'') and ''erastês'' (see below).&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/pederasty Etymologies] in ''American Heritage Dictionary'', ''Random House Dictionary'', and ''Online Etymology Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; Although the word ''pais'' can refer to a child of either sex, ''paiderastia'' is defined by [[Henry Liddell|Liddell]] and [[Robert Scott (philologist)|Scott]]'s [[A Greek-English Lexicon|''Greek-English Lexicon'']] as "the love of boys", and the verb ''paiderasteuein'' as "to be a lover of boys".&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Liddell|Henry George Liddell]] and [[Robert Scott (philologist)|Robert Scott]], ''A Greek-English Lexicon'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1940 9th ed., with 1968 supplement in 1985 reprinting), p. 1286.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the publication of [[Kenneth Dover]]'s work ''[[Greek Homosexuality (book)|Greek Homosexuality]]'', the terms ''erastês'' and ''erômenos'' have been standard for the two pederastic roles.&lt;ref&gt;The pair of terms are used both within and outside the field of classical studies. For surveys and reference works within the study of ancient culture and history, see for instance ''The World of Athens: An Introduction to Classical Athenian Culture'', a publication of the Joint Association of Classical Teachers (Cambridge University Press, 1984, 2003), pp. 149–150 [https://books.google.com/books?id=VgDKeqi4or8C&amp;pg=PA149 online]; John Grimes Younger, ''Sex in the Ancient World from A to Z'' pp. 91–92 [https://books.google.com/books?id=IEqPs2Toy7YC&amp;pg=PA92 online.] Outside classical studies, see for instance Michael Burger, ''The Shaping of Western Civilization: From Antiquity to the Enlightenment'' (University of Toronto Press, 2008), pp. 50–51 [https://books.google.com/books?id=MQUs2QnC2F4C&amp;pg=PA50 online]; Richard C. Friedman and Jennifer I. Downey, ''Sexual Orientation and Psychoanalysis: Sexual Science and Clinical Practice'' (Columbia University Press, 2002), pp. 168–169 [https://books.google.com/books?id=mwtokhymV_4C&amp;pg=PA168 online]; Michael R. Kauth, ''True Nature: A Theory of Sexual Attraction'' (Springer, 2000), p. 87 [https://books.google.com/books?id=PzDKr-qCdTAC&amp;pg=PA87 online]; Roberto Haran, ''Lacan's Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis'' (2004), p. 165ff. [https://books.google.com/books?id=SOl1hki9tSMC&amp;pg=PA165 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; Both words derive from the Greek verb ''erô'', ''erân'', "to love"; see also [[eros]]. In Dover's strict dichotomy, the ''erastês'' ({{lang|grc|ἐραστής}}, plural ''erastai'') is the older lover, seen as the active or dominant partner,&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Dover, ''Greek Homosexuality'' (Harvard University Press, 1978, 1989), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[suffix]] ''-tês'' (-{{lang|grc|τής}}) denoting [[Agent (grammar)|agency]].&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Weir Smyth, "Formation of Substantives," sections 838–839, ''Greek Grammar'' (Harvard University Press, 1920, 1984), pp. 229–230. The insertion of the [[sigma]] between verb stem and suffix is [[Phonaesthetics|euphonic]] (§836).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Erastês'' should be distinguished from Greek ''paiderastês'', which meant "lover of boys" usually with a negative connotation.&lt;ref&gt;Liddell and Scott, ''Greek-English Lexicon'', p. 1286.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''erastês'' himself might only be in his early twenties,&lt;ref&gt;William Armstrong Percy III, ''Pederasty and Pedagogy in Archaic Greece'' (University of Illinois Press, 1996), p. 1 [https://books.google.com/books?id=TCvoj1efp8UC&amp;pg=PA1 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; and thus the age difference between the two lovers might be negligible.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martha Nussbaum]], "Platonic Love and Colorado Law: The Relevance of Ancient Greek Norms to Modern Sexual Controversies," ''Sex and Social Justice'' (Oxford University Press, 1999), p. 309: "because the popular thought of our day tends to focus on the scare image of a 'dirty old man' hanging around outside the school waiting to molest young boys, it is important to mention, as well, that the ''erastês'' might not be very far in age from the ''erômenos''."&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''erômenos'', or "beloved"  (ἐρώμενος, plural ''eromenoi''), is the [[grammatical gender|masculine]] form of the [[Ancient Greek grammar#Participle|present passive participle]] from ''erô'', viewed by Dover as the passive or subordinate partner. An ''erômenos'' can also be called ''pais'', "child".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Dover, ''Greek Homosexuality'', p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''pais'' was regarded as a future citizen, not an "inferior object of sexual gratification", and was portrayed with respect in art.&lt;ref&gt;Marguerite Johnson and Terry Ryan, ''Sexuality in Greek and Roman Society and Literature: A Sourcebook'' (Routledge, 2005), p. 4 [https://books.google.com/books?id=HhjWNd2R1F8C&amp;pg=PA4 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; The word can be understood as an endearment such as a parent might use, found also in the poetry of [[Sappho]]&lt;ref&gt;It is uncertain whether the ''pais'' Kleis is Sappho's actual daughter, or whether the word is affectionate. Anne L. Klinck, "'Sleeping in the Bosom of a Tender Companion': Homoerotic Attachments in Sappho," in ''Same-sex Desire and Love in Greco-Roman Antiquity and in the Classical Tradition of the West'' (Haworth Press, 2005), p. 202 [https://books.google.com/books?id=ejPZu3Ktu5cC&amp;pg=PA202 online]; Jane McIntosh Snyder, ''The Woman and the Lyre'' (Southern Illinois University Press, 1989), p. 3 [https://books.google.com/books?id=X4CLx2PMk4wC&amp;pg=PA3 online.] The word ''pais'' can also be used of a bride; see Johnson and Ryan, ''Sexuality in Greek and Roman Society'', p. 80, note 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and a designation of only relative age. Both art and other literary references show that the ''erômenos'' was at least a teen, with modern age estimates ranging from 13 to 20, or in some cases up to 30. Most evidence indicates that to be an eligible ''erômenos'', a youth would be of an age when an aristocrat began his formal military training,&lt;ref&gt;"We can conclude that the ''erômenos'' is generally old enough for mature military and political action": Nussbaum, "Platonic Love and Colorado Law," p. 309 [https://books.google.com/books?id=7zoaKIolT9oC&amp;pg=PA309 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; that is, from fifteen to seventeen.&lt;ref&gt;See especially Mark Golden, endnote to "Slavery and Homosexuality at Athens: Age Differences between ''erastai'' and ''eromenoi''," in ''Homosexuality in the Ancient World'' (Taylor &amp; Francis, 1992) pp. 175–176 [https://books.google.com/books?id=JrpU6O3VnawC&amp;pg=PA175 online]; also Johnson and Ryan, ''Sexuality in Greek and Roman Society and Culture'', p. 3; Barry S. Strauss, ''Fathers and Sons in Athens: Ideology and Society in the Era of the Peloponnesian War'' (Routledge, 1993), p. 30 [https://books.google.com/books?id=pYcOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA30 online]; Martha Nussbaum, "Eros and the Wise: The Stoic Response to a Cultural Dilemma," ''Oxford Studies in Ancient Philosophy'' 13 (1995, 2001), p. 230 [https://books.google.com/books?id=OHcl0NCon7EC&amp;pg=PA260 online.] Nuances of age also discussed by Ferrari, ''Figures of Speech'', pp. 131–132 [https://books.google.com/books?id=adP_n7PziZIC&amp;pg=PA131 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; As an indication of physical maturity, the ''erômenos'' was sometimes as tall as or taller than the older ''erastês'', and may have his first facial hair.&lt;ref&gt;Dover, ''Greek Homosexuality'', pp. 16 and 85; Ferrari, ''Figures of Speech'', p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Another word used by the Greeks for the younger partner was ''paidika'', a [[grammatical gender|neuter]] plural [[adjective]] ("things having to do with children") treated [[syntax|syntactically]] as masculine singular.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

In poetry and philosophical literature, the ''erômenos'' is often an embodiment of idealized youth; a related ideal depiction of youth in Archaic culture was the ''[[kouros]]'', the long-haired male statuary [[art nude|nude]].&lt;ref&gt;Percy, ''Pederasty and Pedagogy in Archaic Greece'', p. 61, considers the ''kouroi'' to be examples of pederastic art. "The particular attributes that ''kouroi'' display match those of such 'beloveds' in the visual and literary sources from the late archaic to the classical age": Deborah Tam Steiner, ''Images in Mind: Statues in Archaic and Classical Greek Literature and Thought'' (Princeton University Press, 2001), p. 215 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Zah23ru6oCMC&amp;pg=PA218 online.] The presence of facial and pubic hair on some ''kouroi'' disassociates them with the ''erômenos'' if the latter is taken only as a boy who has not entered adolescence; thus Jeffrey M. Hurwit, "The Human Figure in Early Greek Sculpture and Vase-Painting," in ''The Cambridge Companion to Archaic Greece'' (Cambridge University Press, 2007), p. 275 [https://books.google.com/books?id=6LUcuGdJF30C&amp;pg=PA275 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Fragility of Goodness'', [[Martha Nussbaum]], following Dover, defines the ideal ''erômenos'' as

&lt;blockquote&gt;
a beautiful creature without pressing needs of his own. He is aware of his attractiveness, but self-absorbed in his relationship with those who desire him. He will smile sweetly at the admiring lover; he will show appreciation for the other's friendship, advice, and assistance. He will allow the lover to greet him by touching, affectionately, his genitals and his face, while he looks, himself, demurely at the ground. … The inner experience of an ''erômenos'' would be characterized, we may imagine, by a feeling of proud self-sufficiency. Though the object of importunate solicitation, he is himself not in need of anything beyond himself. He is unwilling to let himself be explored by the other's needy curiosity, and he has, himself, little curiosity about the other. He is something like a god, or the statue of a god.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martha Nussbaum]], ''The Fragility of Goodness: (Cambridge University Press, 1986, 2001), p. 188 [https://books.google.com/books?id=GCKqZkyzFO0C&amp;pg=RA2-PA188 online.]''&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dover insisted that the active role of the ''erastês'' and the passivity of the ''erômenos'' is a distinction "of the highest importance",&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; but subsequent scholars have tried to present a more varied picture of the behaviors and values associated with ''paiderastia''. Although ancient Greek writers use ''erastês'' and ''erômenos'' in a pederastic context, the words are not technical terms for social roles, and can refer to the "lover" and "beloved" in other hetero- and homosexual couples.&lt;ref&gt;Dover, "Greek Homosexuality and Initiation," pp. 19–20, notes the usage of "the same words for homosexual as for heterosexual emotion … and the same for its physical consummation" from the archaic period on.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
{{See also|Cretan pederasty}}
The Greek practice of pederasty came suddenly into prominence at the end of the Archaic period of Greek history; there is a brass plaque from Crete, about 650-625 BC, which is the oldest surviving representation of pederastic custom. Such representations appear from all over Greece in the next century; literary sources show it as being established custom in many cities by the 5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Dover, pp. 205-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Cretan pederasty as a social institution seems to have been grounded in an initiation which involved [[Bride kidnapping|abduction]]. A man ({{lang-grc|φιλήτωρ}} – ''philetor'', "lover") selected a youth, enlisted the chosen one's friends to help him, and carried off the object of his affections to his ''andreion'', a sort of men's club or meeting hall. The youth received gifts, and the ''philetor'' along with the friends went away with him for two months into the countryside, where they hunted and feasted. At the end of this time, the ''philetor'' presented the youth with three contractually required gifts: military attire, an ox, and a drinking cup. Other costly gifts followed. Upon their return to the city, the youth sacrificed the ox to Zeus, and his friends joined him at the feast. He received special clothing that in adult life marked him as ''kleinos'', "famous, renowned". The initiate was called a ''parastatheis'', "he who stands beside", perhaps because, like [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]] the cup-bearer of Zeus, he stood at the side of the ''philetor'' during meals in the ''andreion'' and served him from the cup that had been ceremonially presented. In this interpretation, the formal custom reflects [[myth and ritual]].&lt;ref&gt;The main source for this rite of initiation is [[Strabo]] 10.483–484, quoting [[Ephoros]]; the summary given here is the construction of Robert B. Koehl, "The Chieftain Cup and a Minoan Rite of Passage," ''Journal of Hellenic Studies'' 106 (1986), pp. 105–107.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social aspects==

The erastes-eromenos relationship played a role in the Classical Greek social and educational system, had its own complex social-sexual etiquette and was an important social institution among the upper classes.&lt;ref&gt;John Pollini, "The Warren Cup: Homoerotic Love and Symposial Rhetoric in Silver," ''Art Bulletin'' 81.1 (1999) 21–52.&lt;/ref&gt; Pederasty has been understood as educative,&lt;ref&gt;Blake ''et al.'', ''Education in an Age of Nihilism'', p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; and Greek authors from [[Aristophanes]] to [[Pindar]] felt it naturally present in the context of aristocratic education (''[[paideia]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Gregory Nagy]], "Early Greek Views of Poets and Poetry," in ''The Cambridge History of Literary Criticis: Classical Criticism'' (Cambridge University Press, 1989, 1997), p. 40 [https://books.google.com/books?id=qNCDdy6fD18C&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=paiderastia&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=40#v=onepage&amp;q=paiderastia&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; In general, pederasty as described in the Greek literary sources is an institution reserved for free citizens, perhaps to be regarded as a [[Dyad (sociology)|dyadic]] mentorship: "pederasty was widely accepted in Greece as part of a male's coming-of-age, even if its function is still widely debated."&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, Sarah Iles. ''Religions of the Ancient World: A Guide''. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2004. pg. 446; see also Cocca, Carolyn. ''Adolescent Sexuality: A Historical Handbook and Guide''. Westport, Conn.: Praeger, 2006. pg. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

In Crete, in order for the suitor to carry out the ritual abduction, the father had to approve him as worthy of the honor. Among the Athenians, as [[Socrates]] claims in [[Xenophon]]'s ''Symposium,'' "Nothing [of what concerns the boy] is kept hidden from the father, by an ideal&lt;ref&gt;The term here rendered as "ideal" is καλοκἀγαθίᾳ, translated as "a perfect man, a man as he should be" in Liddell and Scott's Greek-English Lexicon (Oxford, 1968; p.397)&lt;/ref&gt; lover."&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, ''Symposium;'' VIII.11&lt;/ref&gt; In order to protect their sons from inappropriate attempts at seduction, fathers appointed slaves called ''[[pedagogue]]s'' to watch over their sons. However, according to Aeschines, Athenian fathers would pray that their sons would be handsome and attractive, with the full knowledge that they would then attract the attention of men and "be the objects of fights because of erotic passions".&lt;ref&gt;Victoria Wohl, ''Love among the Ruins: The Erotics of Democracy in Classical Athens'' p.5 referring to Aeschines, (Tim.134)&lt;/ref&gt;

The age-range when boys entered into such relationships was consonant with that of Greek girls given in marriage, often to adult husbands many years their senior. Boys, however, usually had to be courted and were free to choose their mate, while marriages for girls were arranged for economic and political advantage at the discretion of father and suitor.&lt;ref&gt;A Henri Irénée Marrou, George Lamb, ''History of Education in Antiquity'' p.27&lt;/ref&gt; These connections were also an advantage for a youth and his family, as the relationship with an influential older man resulted in an expanded social network.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Thus, some considered it desirable to have had many admirers or mentors, if not necessarily lovers per se, in one’s younger years.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Typically, after their sexual relationship had ended and the young man had married, the older man and his protégé would remain on close terms throughout their life. For those lovers who continued their lovemaking after their beloveds had matured, the Greeks made allowances, saying, "You can lift up a bull, if you carried the calf."&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Calimach]], ''Lovers' Legends: The Gay Greek Myths''&lt;/ref&gt;

In parts of Greece, pederasty was an acceptable form of homoeroticism that had other, less socially accepted manifestations, such as the sexual use of slaves or being a ''pornos'' ([[prostitution|prostitute]]) or ''hetairos'' (the male equivalent of a [[hetaira]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Greek Homosexuality|date=1978|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0674362616|pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Male prostitution was treated as a perfectly routine matter and visiting prostitutes of either sex was considered completely acceptable for a male citizen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Martha C.

* Becoming one of the nine archons—because the myrtle wreath was worn as sign of the sacred character of that office
* Carrying out a priestly function—because a prostitute was not considered "clean in body"
* Acting as an advocate in the state's interest
* Holding any office whatsoever at any time, in Attica or abroad, whether filled by lot or by election
* Serving as a herald
* Serving as an ambassador
* Addressing the senate or assembly&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aeschines, Against Timarchus|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0002%3Aspeech%3D1%3Asection%3D19 |website=Perseus Digital Library|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref&gt;Aeschines, Against Timarchus 1.19-20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Greek Homosexuality"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kenneth Dover|title=Greek Homosexuality|date=1978|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=United States|isbn=0674362616|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; because it was believed that since they had sold their own body ''for the pleasure of others'' ({{lang|grc|ἐφ’ ὕβρει}} ''eph’ [[hubris|hybrei]]''), they would not hesitate to sell the interests of the community as a whole.&lt;ref name="Greek Homosexuality" /&gt; If they, or an adult citizen of free status who had prostituted himself, performed any of the official functions prohibited to them by law (in later life), they were liable to prosecution and punishment. However, if they did not perform those specific functions, did not present themselves for the allocation of those functions and declared themselves ineligible if they were somehow mistakenly elected to perform those specific functions, they were safe from prosecution and punishment. As non-citizens visiting or residing in a [[Polis|city-state]] could not perform official functions in any case whatsoever, they could prostitute themselves as much as they wanted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kenneth J. Dover|title=Greek Homosexuality|date=1989|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0674362616|page=29|quote=Since foreigners visiting or residing at Athens had no right in any case to hold office or address the assembly, they were free to prostitute themselves as much as they pleased, without incurring any penalty or any disability greater than that which their status as non-citizens already imposed on them. The second implication is that if an Athenian citizen made no secret of his prostitution,(Like who could trust Barney Frank anyway.) declared his unfitness if through someone's inadvertence he was elected to office, and abstained from embarking on any of the procedures forbidden to him by the law, he was safe from prosecution and punishment.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political expression===
Transgressions of the customs pertaining to the proper expression of homosexuality within the bounds of ''pederaistia'' could be used to damage the reputation of a public figure.  In his speech ''Against Timarchus'' in 346 BC, the Athenian politician [[Aeschines]] argues against further allowing Timarchus, an experienced middle-aged politician, certain political rights as Attic law prohibited anyone who had prostituted himself from exercising those rights&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kenneth J. Dover|title=Greek Homosexuality|date=1978|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0674362616|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Timarchus was known to have spent his adolescence as the sexual partner of a series of wealthy men in order to obtain money.&lt;ref&gt;Aeschines, Against Timarchus 1.51-52&lt;/ref&gt; Such a law existed because it was believed that anyone who had sold their own body would not hesitate to sell the interests of the city-state.&lt;ref name="Greek Homosexuality" /&gt; Aeschines won his case, and Timarchus was sentenced to ''[[atimia]]'' (disenfranchisement and civic disempowerment). Aeschines acknowledges his own dalliances with beautiful boys, the erotic poems he dedicated to these youths, and the scrapes he has gotten into as a result of his affairs, but emphasizes that none of these were mediated by money. A financial motive thus was viewed as threatening a man's status as free.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

By contrast, as expressed in [[Pausanias of Athens|Pausanias']] speech in Plato's ''Symposium,'' pederastic love was said to be favorable to [[democracy]] and feared by tyrants, because the bond between the ''erastes'' and ''eromenos'' was stronger than that of obedience to a despotic ruler.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Hindley, "Debate: Law, Society and Homosexuality in Classical Athens" in ''Past and Present,'' 133 (1991), p. 167n4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plato ''Symposium'' 182c.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Athenaeus]] states that "Hieronymus the Aristotelian says that love with boys was fashionable because several tyrannies had been overturned by young men in their prime, joined together as comrades in mutual sympathy." He gives as examples of such pederastic couples the Athenians [[Harmodius and Aristogeiton]], who were credited (perhaps symbolically) with the overthrow of the tyrant [[Hippias (tyrant)|Hippias]] and the establishment of the democracy, and also Chariton and Melanippus.&lt;ref&gt;Athenaeus, ''Deipnosophists,'' 602&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as Aristotle, claimed that the Cretan lawgivers encouraged pederasty as a means of [[population control]], by directing love and sexual desire into non-procreative channels:

&lt;blockquote&gt;and the lawgiver has devised many wise measures to secure the benefit of moderation at table, and the segregation of the women in order that they may not bear many children, for which purpose he instituted association with the male sex.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Politics'' 2.1272a 22–24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Philosophical expression===
&lt;!--clearer outline of different philosophical positions needed; where are the Stoics, for instance?--&gt;
Socrates' love of [[Alcibiades]], which was more than reciprocated, is held as an example of chaste pederasty.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}. Socrates remarks in the dialogue Phaedrus that sexual pederasty is driven by the appetital part of the soul, but can be balanced by self-control and reason. He likens wanton lust for a boy to allowing a disobedient horse to control a chariot, but remarks that sexual desire for a boy if combined with a love for their other qualities is acceptable.

[[Phaedrus (Athenian)|Phaedrus]] in Plato's Symposium remarks:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
For I know not any greater blessing to a young man who is beginning in life than a virtuous lover, or to a lover than a beloved youth. For the principle, I say, neither kindred, nor honor, nor wealth, nor any motive is able to implant so well as love. Of what am I speaking? Of the sense of honor and dishonor, without which neither states nor individuals ever do any good or great work… And if there were only some way of contriving that a state or an army should be made up of lovers and their loves, they would be the very best governors of their own city, abstaining from all dishonor and emulating one another in honor; and it is scarcely an exaggeration to say that when fighting at each other’s side, although a mere handful, they would overcome the world.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, Phaedrus in the ''Symposium''{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Laws, Plato takes a much more austere stance to homosexuality than in previous works, stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt; ... one certainly should not fail to observe that when male unites with female for procreation the pleasure experienced is held to be due to nature, but contrary to nature when male mates with male or female with female, and that those first guilty of such enormities [the Cretans] were impelled by their slavery to pleasure. And we all accuse the Cretans of concocting the story about Ganymede. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Plato states here that "we all", possibly referring to society as a whole or simply his social group, believe the story of Ganymede's homosexuality to have been fabricated by the Cretans to justify immoral behaviours. 

The Athenian stranger in Plato's ''Laws'' blames pederasty for promoting civil strife and driving many to their wits' end, and recommends the prohibition of [[sexual intercourse]] with youths, laying out a path whereby this may be accomplished.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Laws'', 636d and 835e&lt;/ref&gt;

===In myth and religion===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Religion and sexuality]]--&gt;&lt;!--For instance, if there's any basis to treating Narcissus as a pederastic myth, that should be moved here--&gt;

The [[Greek mythology|myth]] of [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]]'s abduction by [[Zeus]] was invoked as a precedent for the pederastic relationship, as Theognis asserts to a friend:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
There is some pleasure in loving a boy ''(paidophilein)'', since once in fact even the son of [[Cronus]] ''(that is, Zeus)'', king of immortals, fell in love with Ganymede, seized him, carried him off to [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]], and made him divine, keeping the lovely bloom of boyhood ''(paideia)''. So, don't be astonished, Simonides, that I too have been revealed as captivated by love for a handsome boy.&lt;ref&gt;Theognidean corpus 1345–50, as cited by Kamen, "The Life Cycle in Archaic Greece," p. 91. Although the speaker is identified here conventionally as Theognis, certain portions of the work attributed to him may not be by the Megaran poet.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The myth of Ganymede's abduction, however, was not taken seriously by some in Athenian society, and deemed to be a Cretan fabrication designed to justify their homoeroticism.&lt;ref&gt; Plato's Laws, 636c &lt;/ref&gt;

The scholar Joseph Pequigney states:

&lt;blockquote&gt; Neither Homer nor Hesiod ever explicitly ascribes homosexual experiences to the gods or to heroes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The 5th century BC poet [[Pindar]] constructed the story of a sexual pederastic relationship between [[Poseidon]] and [[Pelops]], this was intended to replace an earlier story of cannibalism that Pindar deemed an unsavoury representation of the Gods.&lt;ref&gt; Joseph Pequigney, Homosexuality in ancient Greek myth &lt;/ref&gt; The story tells of Poseidon's love for a mortal boy, Pelops, who wins a chariot race with help from his admirer Poseidon. 

Though examples of such a custom exist in earlier Greek works, myths providing examples of young men who were the lovers of gods began to emerge in classical literature, around the 6th century BC. In these later tales, pederastic love is ascribed to [[Zeus]] (with [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]]), [[Poseidon]] (with [[Pelops]]), [[Apollo]] (with Cyparissus, Hyacinthus and Adnetus), [[Orpheus]], [[Heracles]], [[Dionysus]], [[Hermes]], and [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]].  All the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian gods]] except [[Ares]] are purported to have had these relationships, which some scholars argue demonstrates that the specific customs of ''paiderastia'' originated in initiatory rituals.&lt;ref&gt;Sergent, ''Homosexuality and Greek Myth,'' ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GLBTQ Mythology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glbtq.com/literature/classical_myth.html |title=Classical Mythology |publisher=[[glbtq.com]] |accessdate=February 5, 2015 |last=Pequigney |first=Joseph |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129042407/http://www.glbtq.com/literature/classical_myth.html |archivedate=29 November 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Myths attributed to the homosexuality of [[Dionysus]] are very late and often post-pagan additions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ampelos]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=February 2018}} The tale of Dionyssus and [[Ampelos]] was written by the Egyptian poet [[Nonnus]] some time between the 4th and 5th centuries AD, making it unreliable. Likewise, the tale of Dionysus and [[Polymnus]], which tells that the former anally masturbated with a fig branch over the latter's grave, was written by Christians, whose aim was to discredit pagan mythology.&lt;ref&gt; Hyginus, Astronomy 2.5; Clement of Alexandria, Protreptikos 2.34.2-5; Arnobius, Against the Gentiles 5.28 (Dalby 2005, pp. 108–117) &lt;/ref&gt;

Dover, however, believed that these myths are only literary versions expressing or explaining the "overt" homosexuality of Greek archaic culture, the distinctiveness of which he contrasted to attitudes in other ancient societies such as Egypt and Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Dover, "Greek Homosexuality and Initiation,"''passim'', especially pp. 19–20, 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Greek pottery|Greek vase painting]] is a major source for scholars seeking to understand attitudes and practices associated with ''paiderastia''.&lt;ref&gt;For a recent collation of evidence from vase-painting and an introduction to its interpretation, see [[Andrew Lear]], and [[Eva Cantarella]], ''Images of Ancient Greek Pederasty: Boys Were Their Gods'' (Routledge, 2008). {{ISBN|978-0-415-22367-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of pederastic scenes are depicted on [[Black-figure pottery#Attica|Attic black-figure vases]].&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Kamen, "The Life Cycle in Archaic Greece," in ''The Cambridge Companion to Archaic Greece'' (Cambridge University Press, 2007), p. 91 [https://books.google.com/books?id=6LUcuGdJF30C&amp;pg=PA91&amp;dq=%22hundreds+of+representations+of+pederastic+relationships%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22hundreds%20of%20representations%20of%20pederastic%20relationships%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century, [[John Beazley]] classified pederastic vases into three types:
* The ''erastês'' and ''erômenos'' stand facing each other; the ''erastês'', knees bent, reaches with one hand for the beloved's chin and with the other for his genitals.
* The ''erastês'' presents the ''erômenos'' with a small gift, sometimes an animal.
* The standing lovers engage in [[intercrural sex]].&lt;ref&gt;Beazley as summarized by Percy, ''Pederasty and Pedagogy in Archaic Greece'', p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain gifts traditionally given by the ''eromenos'' become symbols that contribute to interpreting a given scene as pederastic. Animal gifts—most commonly hares and roosters, but also deer and felines—point toward hunting as an aristocratic pastime and as a metaphor for sexual pursuit.&lt;ref&gt;Judith M. Barringer, ''The Hunt in Ancient Greece'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001), pp. 70–72 [https://books.google.com/books?id=PMqCYtXqub4C&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=%22Attic+vase+painting+scenes+of+pederastic+courtship%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Attic%20vase%20painting%20scenes%20of%20pederastic%20courtship%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The explicit nature of some images has led in particular to discussions of whether the ''eromenos'' took active pleasure in the sex act. The youthful beloved is never pictured with an erection; his penis "remains flaccid even in circumstances to which one would expect the penis of any healthy adolescent to respond willy-nilly".&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, ''The Fragility of Goodness'', p. 188; see also Dover, ''Greek Homosexuality'', p. 96; Percy, ''Pederasty and Pedagogy in Archaic Greece'', p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; Fondling the youth's genitals was one of the most common images of pederastic courtship on vases, a gesture indicated also in Aristophanes' comedy ''[[The Birds (play)|Birds]]'' (line 142). Some vases do show the younger partner as sexually responsive, prompting one scholar to wonder, "What can the point of this act have been unless lovers in fact derived some pleasure from feeling and watching the boy's developing organ wake up and respond to their manual stimulation?"&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hubbard, review of David Halperin's ''How to Do the History of Homosexuality'' (2002), ''Bryn Mawr Classical Review'' 22 September 2003 [http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2003/2003-09-22.html online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chronological study of the vase paintings also reveals a changing aesthetic in the depiction of the ''erômenos''. In the 6th century BC, he is a young beardless man with long hair, of adult height and physique, usually nude. As the 5th century begins, he has become smaller and slighter, "barely pubescent", and often draped as a girl would be. No inferences about social customs should be based on this element of the courtship scene alone.&lt;ref&gt;Ferrari, ''Figures of Speech'', p. 140; Percy, ''Pederasty and Pedagogy in Archaic Greece'', pp. 119–120.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Poetry====
There are many pederastic references among the works of the [[Megara]]n poet [[Theognis]] addressed to Cyrnus (Greek ''Kyrnos'').  Some portions of the Theognidean corpus are probably not by the individual from Megara, but rather represent "several generations of [[wisdom poetry]]".  The poems are "social, political, or ethical precepts transmitted to Cyrnus as part of his formation into an adult Megarian aristocrat in Theognis' own image".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas K. Hubbard, ''Homosexuality in Greece and Rome:''
a sourcebook of basic documents in translation,'' University of California, 2003; p.23''&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between Theognis and Kyrnos eludes categorization. Although it was assumed in antiquity that Kyrnos was the poet's ''eromenos'', the poems that are most explicitly erotic are not addressed to him; the poetry&lt;ref&gt;Theognis, 2.1353–56.&lt;/ref&gt; on "the joys and sorrows" of pederasty seem more apt for sharing with a fellow ''erastes'', perhaps in the setting of the symposium: "the relationship, in any case, is left vague."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Lamberton, ''Hesiod'' (Yale University Press, 1988), p. 26 [https://books.google.com/books?id=BL2AZpopNu8C&amp;pg=RA1-PA26&amp;dq=Theognis+Kyrnos&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=50&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=9#v=onepage&amp;q=Theognis%20Kyrnos&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;  In general, Theognis (and the tradition that appears under his name) treats the pederastic relationship as heavily pedagogical.&lt;ref&gt;On the contrast between the Theognidean and Anacreontic visions of pederasty, see [[Andrew Lear]] 'Ancient Pederasty:  an introduction' in ''A Companion to Greek and Roman Sexualities'', ed. Thomas K. Hubbard (Wiley Blackwell, 2014), pp. 104-5&lt;/ref&gt;

The poetic traditions of Ionia and Aeolia featured poets such as [[Anacreon]], [[Mimnermus]] and [[Alcaeus of Mytilene|Alcaeus]], who composed many of the sympotic [[skolia]] that were to become later part of the mainland tradition. [[Ibycus]] came from [[Rhegium]] in the Greek west and entertained the court of [[Polycrates]] in Samos with pederastic verses.  By contrast with Theognis, these poets portray a version of pederasty that is non-pedagogical, focused exclusively on love and seduction. [[Theocritus]], a Hellenistic poet, describes a kissing contest for youths that took place at the tomb of a certain Diocles, renowned for friendship; he notes that invoking [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]] was proper to the occasion.&lt;ref&gt;Theocritus, Idyll XII.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beazley, "Some Attic Vases in the Cyprus Museum", ''Proceedings of the British Academy'' 33 (1947); p.199; Dover, ''Greek Homosexuality'', pp. 94-96.&lt;/ref&gt; (Athenian amphora, 5th century BCE)]]

==Sexual practices==
Vase paintings and references to the eromenos's thighs in poetry&lt;ref&gt;For examples, see Johnson and Ryan, ''Sexuality in Greek and Roman Society'', p. 116, note 4, quoting a fragment from [[Solon]]: "a man falls in love with a youth in the full-flower of boy-love / possessed of desire-enhancing thighs and a honey-sweet mouth"; Nussbaum, ''Sex and Social Justice'', p. 450, note 48, quoting a fragment of the lost ''Myrmidons'' of [[Aeschylus]] in which [[Achilles]] mourns the dead [[Patroclus]], their "many kisses", and the "god-fearing converse with your thighs".&lt;/ref&gt; indicate that when the pederastic couple engaged in sex acts, the preferred form was [[intercrural sex|intercrural]].&lt;ref&gt;Percy, ''Pederasty and Pedagogy in Archaic Greece'', p. 119; Nussbaum, ''Sex and Social Justice'', pp. 268, 307, 335; Ferrari, ''Figures of Speech'', p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; To preserve his dignity and honor, the ''erômenos'' limits the man who desires him to penetration between closed thighs.&lt;ref&gt;Ferrari, ''Figures of Speech'', p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no known visual depictions of [[Anal sex]] between pederastic couples, though this does not prove the behavior did not occur. Some vase paintings, which Percy considers a fourth type of pederastic scene in addition to Beazley's three, show the ''erastês'' seated with an erection and the ''erômenos'' either approaching or climbing into his lap. The composition of these scenes is the same as that for depictions of women mounting men who are seated and aroused for intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;Percy, ''Pederasty and Pedagogy in Ancient Greece,'' p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; As a cultural norm considered apart from personal preference, anal penetration was most often seen as dishonorable to the one penetrated, or shameful,&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, ''Sex and Social Justice'', pp. 268, 335; Ferrari, ''Figures of Speech'', p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; because of "its potential appearance of being turned into a woman" and because it was feared that it may distract the ''erômenos'' from playing the active, penetrative role later in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nussbaum|first1=Martha C.|title=Platonic Love and Colorado Law: The Relevance of Ancient Greek Norms to Modern Sexual Controversies|journal=Virginia Law Review|date=1994|volume=80|issue=7|pages=1547, 1550|jstor=1073514|quote=* Where relations between two male citizens are concerned, we again find no general condemnation, but instead a complex system of caveats or reservations. We must begin by noting that these relations, even when they involve people close to one another in age, always involve an asymmetry of roles: the erastes or "lover" is the older partner, who actively pursues and courts the younger, drawn by the sight of youthful male beauty. The eraste's is expected to be keenly interested in sexual contact; this interest, and the active, penetrative conduct that follows from it, is taken to be perfectly normal and natural. The younger partner, the eromenos or "beloved", is likely to be pleased at being the object of admiration and interested in benefits such as friendship, education, and political advancement that a relationship with an erastes may bestow. The relationship may in this sense involve a real reciprocity of benefits and mutual affection based on it. But the cultural norm dictates that the eromenos is not to have a keen sexual interest in being penetrated, nor to develop habits of enjoying that sort of penetration; for that would be, in effect, to be turned into a woman, and one could expect that this would make him unfit to play, later in life, an active manly role. * The important point to stress, in any case, is that the shame potentially at issue was not about the fact of same-sex copulation, but about the "womanish" position of passivity and its potential appearance of being turned into a woman. No such shame, it would seem, attached even potentially to conduct that did not involve anal penetration, thus not to conduct involving intercrural intercourse, apparently the most common mode of male-male copulation}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fable attributed to [[Aesop]] tells how [[Aeschyne]] (Shame) consented to enter the human body from behind only as long as Eros did not follow the same path, and would fly away at once if he did. A man who acted as the receiver during anal intercourse may have been the recipient of the insult "kinaidos", meaning effeminate.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aesop]], "Zeus and Shame" (Perry 109, Chambry 118, Gibbs 528), in ''Fables''.&lt;/ref&gt; No shame was associated with intercrural penetration or any other act that did not involve anal penetration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nussbaum|first1=Martha C.|title=Platonic Love and Colorado Law: The Relevance of Ancient Greek Norms to Modern Sexual Controversies|journal=Virginia Law Review|date=1994|volume=80|issue=7|pages=1550|jstor=1073514|quote=No such shame, it would seem, attached even potentially to conduct that did not involve anal penetration, thus not to conduct involving intercrural intercourse, apparently the most common mode of male-male copulation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oral sex is likewise not depicted,{{Request quotation|date=September 2015}} or directly suggested, anal or oral penetration seems to have been reserved for prostitutes or slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson and Ryan, ''Sexuality in Greek and Roman Society and Literature'', p. 3, based on Attic red-figure pottery; Percy, ''Pederasty and Pedagogy in Ancient Greece,'' p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dover maintained that the erômenos was ideally not supposed to feel "unmanly" desire for the erastês.&lt;ref&gt;Dover, ''Greek Homosexuality''{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martha Nussbaum|Nussbaum]] argues that the depiction of the erômenos as deriving no sexual pleasure from sex with the erastês "may well be a cultural norm that conceals a more complicated reality", as the erômenos is known to have frequently felt intense affection for his erastês and there is evidence that he experienced sexual arousal with him as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Martha C. Nussbaum|title=Platonic Love and Colorado Law: The Relevance of Ancient Greek Norms to Modern Sexual Controversies|journal=Virginia Law Review|date=1994|volume=80|issue=7|pages=1554–1555|jstor=1073514|publisher=Virginia Law Review|quote=We must now also address the issue of mutuality, which Finnis misuses to make the erastes-eromenos relationship look inherently exploitative. It is true that the eromenos is depicted typically as deriving no sexual pleasure from the conduct, although this may well be a cultural norm that conceals a more complicated reality. Dover aptly compares the situation of the eromenos to that of a young woman in Britain in the 1930s (Dover, Greek Homosexuality, supra note 48, at 88). He might have extended the comparison to take in this point: just as a proper Victorian woman was publicly expected not to enjoy sex, but frequently did in private, so too it is possible that the eromenos derived more pleasure than is publicly depicted. In his postscript to the second edition, Dover grants that there is some literary evidence that the erastes stimulated the penis of the eromenos, and that one vase shows an eromenos with an erection. What is more important is that it is perfectly clear that a successful relationship of this sort produced many advantages for the younger man- education, political advancement, friendship and that he frequently felt intense affection for the erastes as a result.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Plato's ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'',  it is related that, with time, the erômenos develops a "passionate longing" for his erastês and a "reciprocal love" (''anteros'') for him that is a replica of the erastês' love. The eromenos is also said to have a desire "similar to the erastes', albeit weaker, to see, to touch, to kiss and to lie with him".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Martha C. Nussbaum|title=Platonic Love and Colorado Law: The Relevance of Ancient Greek Norms to Modern Sexual Controversies|journal=Virginia Law Review|date=1994|volume=80|issue=7|pages=1572–1573|jstor=1073514|publisher=Virginia Law Review|quote=Nor is passionate arousal a mere stage in the soul's progress: it gives rise to an enduring relationship in which physical infatuation is deepened by conversation and the pursuit of shared spiritual goals and in which the "mad" lover's state gives rise to generous and stable friendship, rather than to the dangers of which "Lysias" warns. Most remarkable of all, it also gives rise to a reciprocation of sexual desire on the part of the younger man who, taking note of the unparalleled generosity of his lover, finds himself suffused with a stream of desire from "the source of that stream that Zeus, in love with Ganymede, called 'passionate longing.'" The younger man conceives a longing and desire for his erastes, "having a 'reciprocal-love' [anteros] that is a replica of the other's love." But he calls it, and thinks that it is, philia rather than eros. He has desire similar to the other's, albeit weaker, to see, to touch, to kiss, to lie with him. Recall that Greek homosexuality involves reciprocity conventionally of a sort, for the eromenos receives kindliness and education in return for his beauty. Here the language indicates the culturally unusual nature of the proposal, for the young man lacks a word for his own desire. Plato, thus, constructs a more thoroughgoing understanding of reciprocity, extending to the body's longing for beauty. The relationship is envisaged as a long-lasting one, in which the erastes and eromenos "associate with touching in the gymnasia and in other places of association". What is at issue is a complicated etymological play on the word himeros, or "passionate longing". Himeros has been etymologized as deriving from "particles" (mere') that "flow" (rhein) from the beloved to the lover. The dialogue is suffused with this sort of word play, much of it erotic. See id.; cf. Plato, Cratylus 419e (using similarly expressive and erotic language).  Such reciprocity was not unknown before this-Socrates describes the experience as one that is likely to follow upon the young man's perception of his lover's generosity-but what is clear is that the cultural vocabulary lacks a description for it.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional characteristics==
===The Greek East===
Unlike the Dorians, where a lover would usually have only one eromenos, in the east a man might have several eromenoi over the course of his life. From the poems of Alcaeus we learn that the lover would customarily invite his eromenos to dine with him.&lt;ref&gt;Percy, William A. ''Pederasty and Pedagogy in Archaic Greece,'' pp146-150&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sparta===
[[File:Hyakinthos.jpg|thumb|[[Zephyrus]] and [[Hyacinth (mythology)|Hyacinthus]], the latter was a patron hero of pederasty in Greece. Attic red-figure cup from Tarquinia, c.&amp;nbsp;490&amp;nbsp;BC]]
The nature of this relationship is in dispute among ancient sources, and modern historians. 

Spartan views on pederasty and homoeroticism were much more austere than those of other parts of Greece.

[[Xenophon]] says in Constitution of the Lacaedemonians that Spartan customs were unsuited to pederasty: a man might aim for idealized friendship with a boy but a sexual relationship was considered "an abomination" tantamount to incest.&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], ''Constitution of the Lacedaemonians'', 2.13: "The customs instituted by Lycurgus were opposed to all of these. If someone, being himself an honest man, admired a boy's soul and tried to make of him an ideal friend without reproach and to associate with him, he approved, and believed in the excellence of this kind of training. But if it was clear that the attraction lay in the boy's outward beauty, he banned the connexion as an abomination; and thus he caused lovers to abstain from boys no less than parents abstain from sexual intercourse with their children and brothers and sisters with each other." [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0210%3Atext%3DConst.+Lac.%3Achapter%3D2%3Asection%3D13 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]]'s Historical Miscellany talks about the responsibilities of an older Spartan citizen to younger inexperienced male lovers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Claudius Aelianus]] ''Various History'', 3.10: "I could cite many fine features on the [[ephor]]s of Sparta: I chose a few, I'll report. If a young Spartan, beautiful and well made, preferred a rich friend to a poor righteous man, the [[ephor]]s condemned him to a fine; no doubt, that he might be punished by his love for wealth by the loss of part of his. They punished the same every citizen honest man, who was attached by friendship to none of the young people that we knew to be well born: they thought that an honest man would have made his friend, and perhaps some others, in people like him. Indeed, the kindness of those who love, if indeed deserves to be respected, is a powerful stimulus to excite the beloved's virtue. A Spartan law even ordered to pardon a young man, for his youth and inexperience, the mistakes he committed, and to punish in its place the citizen who loved him, to teach him to be the supervisor and judge of the actions of his friend."&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas F. Scanlon believes [[Sparta]], during its [[Dorians|Dorian]] polis time, is thought to be the first city to practice athletic nudity, and one of the first to formalize pederasty.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas F. Scanlon, "The Dispersion of Pederasty and the Athletic Revolution in Sixth-Century BC Greece," in ''Same-Sex Desire and Love in Greco-Roman Antiquity and in the Classical Tradition of the West,'' pp. 64-70.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Megara===
[[Megara]] cultivated good relations with Sparta, and may have been culturally attracted to emulate Spartan practices in the 7th century, when pederasty is postulated to have first been formalized in Dorian cities.&lt;ref&gt;N.G.L. Hammond, ''A history of Greece to 322 BC,'' 1989; p.150&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first cities after Sparta to be associated with the custom of [[athletic nudity]], [[Megara]] was home to the runner [[Orsippus]] who was famed as the first to run the footrace naked at the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]] and "first of all Greeks to be crowned victor naked".&lt;ref&gt;W. Sweet, ''Sport and Recreation in Ancient Greece,'' 1987; p.125&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, 1.44.1&lt;/ref&gt; In one poem, the Megaran poet Theognis saw athletic nudity as a prelude to pederasty: "Happy is the lover who works out naked / And then goes home to sleep all day with a beautiful boy."&lt;ref&gt;Theognis, 2.1335–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Athens===
{{main article|Athenian pederasty}}
In Athens, as elsewhere, ''pederastia'' appears to have been a characteristic of the aristocracy.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} [[Greek pottery|Attic pottery]] is a major source for modern scholars attempting to understand the institution of pederasty.&lt;ref&gt;Rommel Mendès-Leite et al. ''Gay Studies from the French Cultures'' p.157; Percy, "Reconsiderations about Greek Homosexualities," pp. 30-31.&lt;/ref&gt; The age of youth depicted has been estimated variously from 12 to 18.&lt;ref&gt;Percy, "Reconsiderations about Greek Homosexualities," p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of Athenian laws addressed the pederastic relationship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

===Boeotia===
In [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]], the main polis in [[Boeotia]], renowned for its practice of pederasty, the tradition was enshrined in the [[founding myth]] of the city.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} In this instance the story was meant to teach by counterexample: it depicts [[Laius]], one of the mythical ancestors of the Thebans, in the role of a lover who betrays the father and rapes the son. Another Boeotian pederastic myth is the story of [[Narcissus (mythology)|Narcissus]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

According to Plutarch, Theban pederasty was instituted as an educational device for boys in order to "soften, while they were young, their natural fierceness, and to "temper the manners and characters of the youth".&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of [[Pelopidas]]''{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a tradition, The [[Sacred Band of Thebes]] comprised pederastic couples.&lt;ref&gt;David Leitao, 'The legend of the Theban Band', in M. Craven Nussbaum and J. Sihvola ''The Sleep of Reason'': Erotic Experience and Sexual Ethics in Ancient Greece and Rome'', Chicago University Press (2002), pages 140-50''&lt;/ref&gt;

Boeotian pottery, in contrast to that of Athens, does not exhibit the [[Pederasty in ancient Greece#In art|three types of pederastic scenes]] identified by Beazley. The limited survival and cataloguing of pottery that can be proven to have been made in Boeotia diminishes the value of this evidence in distinguishing a specifically local tradition of ''paiderastia''.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Hupperts, "Boeotian Swine: Homosexuality in Boeotia" in ''Same-Sex Desire and Love in Greco-Roman Antiquity,'' p. 190 [https://books.google.com/books?id=ejPZu3Ktu5cC&amp;pg=PA190&amp;dq=%22we+notice+that+we+do+not+find+on+the+Boeotian+vases%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22we%20notice%20that%20we%20do%20not%20find%20on%20the%20Boeotian%20vases%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern scholarship==
The ethical views held in ancient societies, such as [[Athens]], [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]], [[Crete]], [[Sparta]], [[Elis]] and others, on the practice of pederasty have been explored by scholars only since the end of the 19th century. One of the first to do so was [[John Addington Symonds]], who wrote his seminal work ''A Problem in Greek Ethics'' in 1873, but after a private edition of 10 copies (1883) only in 1901 could the work really be published, in revised form.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/lgbt/pge/index.htm A Problem in Greek Ethics Index&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Carpenter]] expanded the scope of the study, with his 1914 work, ''Intermediate Types among Primitive Folk''. The text examines homoerotic practices of all types, not only pederastic ones, and ranges over cultures spanning the whole globe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/lgbt/itp/index.htm Intermediate Types among Primitive Folk Index&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  In Germany the work was continued by classicist Paul Brandt writing under the pseudonym Hans Licht, who published his ''Sexual Life in Ancient Greece'' in 1932.

Mainstream [[Ancient Greek]] studies however had historically omitted references of the widespread practice of [[homosexuality]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} [[E. M. Forster]]'s 1914 novel [[Maurice (novel)|''Maurice'']] makes reference to modern European ambivalence toward this aspect of ancient Greek culture in a scene where a [[Cambridge]] professor, leading a group of students in translating an ancient Greek text says, "Omit the reference to the unspeakable vice of the Greeks."   Later in the 1940s H. Mitchell wrote: "This aspect of Greek morals is an extraordinary one, into which, for the sake of our equanimity, it is unprofitable to pry too closely". It would not be until 1978 and [[Kenneth Dover|K. J. Dover]]'s book ''[[Greek Homosexuality (book)|Greek Homosexuality]],'' that the topic would be widely and frankly discussed.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Dover's work triggered a number of debates which still continue. Sociologist of the 20th century [[Michel Foucault]] declared that pederasty was "problematized" in Greek culture, that it was "the object of a special—and especially intense—moral preoccupation", which was "subjected to an interplay of positive and negative interplays so complex as to make the ethics that governed it difficult to decipher",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mark Masterson|author2=Nancy Sorkin Rabinowitz|author3=James Robson|title=Sex in Antiquity: Exploring Gender and Sexuality in the Ancient World|date=5 December 2014 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781317602774 |page=115 |edition=revised |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k1G2BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA115 |accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; focusing on concern with the chastity/moderation of the ''erōmenos'' (the term used for the "beloved" youth).{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} A modern line of thought leading from Dover to Foucault to Halperin holds that the erōmenos did not reciprocate the love and desire of the erastes, and that the relationship was factored on a sexual domination of the younger by the older, a politics of penetration held to be true of all adult male Athenians' relations with their social inferiors—boys, women and slaves—a theory propounded also by Eva Keuls.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Keuls, ''The Reign of the Phallus: Sexual Politics in Ancient Athens,'' 1985&lt;/ref&gt; From this perspective, the relationships are characterized and factored on a power differential between the participants, and as essentially asymmetrical.

Other scholars point to artwork on vases, poetry and philosophical works such as the Platonic discussion of [[anteros]], "love returned", all of which show tenderness and desire and love on the part of the eromenos matching and responding to that of the erastes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Critics of Dover and his followers also point out that they ignore all material which argued against their "overly theoretical" interpretation of a human and emotional relationship&lt;ref&gt;James Davidson, ''The Greeks and Greek Love,'' Orion, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and counter that "Clearly, a mutual, consensual bond was formed",&lt;ref&gt;Robert B. Koehl, "Ephoros and Ritualized Homosexuality in Bronze Age Crete", in ''Queer Representations: Reading Livers, Reading Cultures;'' Martin Duberman, ed. New York University, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; and that it is "a modern fairy tale that the younger eromenos was never aroused".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/ho-hz/homosexuality/homosexuality.html Hein van Dolen, ''Greek homosexuality'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Halperin's position has been criticized as a "persistently negative and judgmental rhetoric implying exploitation and domination as the fundamental characteristics of pre-modern sexual models" and challenged as a polemic of "mainstream assimilationist gay apologists" and an attempt to "demonize and purge from the movement" all non-orthodox male sexualities, especially that involving adults and adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas K. Hubbard, "Bryn Mawr Classical Review 2003.09.22" of David M. Halperin's ''How to Do the History of Homosexuality''[http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/2003/.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

As classical historian [[Robin Osborne]] has pointed out, historical discussion of ''paiderastia'' is complicated by 21st-century moral standards:&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is the historian's job to draw attention to the personal, social, political and indeed moral issues behind the literary and artistic representations of the Greek world. The historian's job is to present pederasty and all, to make sure that … we come face to face with the way [[To Helen#Revised 1845 version|the glory that was Greece]] was part of a world in which many of our own [[value system|core values]] find themselves challenged rather than reinforced.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robin Osborne]], ''Greek History'' (Routledge, 2004), pp. 12 [https://books.google.com/books?id=4baOPEunQgoC&amp;pg=PA12 online] and 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Records of guidelines related to "people skills" have been found as early as the New Testament. Five examples of early human guidelines appear in the [[Bible]]. [[First Epistle of Peter|1 Peter]] 4:8-9 advises: "Above all, maintain constant love for one another, for love covers a multitude of sins. Be hospitable to one another without complaining."; and [[Solomon]]'s wisdom in [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 15:1 includes: "A soft answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger.", along similar lines in [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 16:21 includes: "The wise of heart is called perceptive, and pleasant speech increases persuasiveness."; [[First Epistle to the Thessalonians|1 Thessalonians]] 5:14 dictates: "And we urge you, beloved, to discourage the idlers, encourage the fainthearted, help the weak, be patient with all of them."; [[Epistle to Titus|Titus]] 3:2 advises: " To speak evil of no one, to avoid quarreling, to be gentle, and to show every courtesy to everyone."; and in [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] 6:2 encourages: "Bear one another's burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the [[Golden Rule|law]] of Christ."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/versions/New-Revised-Standard-Version-NRSV-Bible/ "New Revised Standard Version"] Retrieved on 2009-08-18&lt;/ref&gt;

[[human relations|Human-relations]] studies emerged in the 1920s when companies became more interested in "[[soft skills]]" and interpersonal skills of employees.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} In organizations, improving people skills became a specialized role of the [[corporate trainer]]. By the mid-1930s, [[Dale Carnegie]] popularized people skills in ''[[How to Win Friends and Influence People]]'' and ''[[How to Stop Worrying and Start Living]]'' worldwide.

In the 1960s, US schools introduced people-skills topics and methods—often as a way to promote better [[self-esteem]], communication and social interaction. These encompassed psychologist [[Thomas Gordon (psychologist)|Thomas Gordon]]'s "Effectiveness Training" variations as well as many other training programs.&lt;ref&gt;Schaps, E.; Cohen, A.Y.; and Resnik, H.S.: [http://www.pire.org/detail.asp?detayl=y&amp;core=11989 "Balancing Head and Heart"] PIRE.

(By the 1980s, "[[traditional education]]" and a "back-to-basics" [[The three Rs|three-Rs]] emphasis largely pushed these programs aside,&lt;ref&gt;Doll, R.C. [http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICDocs/data/ericdocs2sql/content_storage_01/0000019b/80/32/83/49.pdf "Humanizing Education by Improving Communication"] ERIC.

The first documented use of the phrase "people skills" was around 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=People+skills&amp;case_insensitive=on&amp;year_start=1900&amp;year_end=2008&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t4%3B%2CPeople%20skills%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3Bpeople%20skills%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BPeople%20Skills%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BPeople%20skills%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BPEOPLE%20SKILLS%3B%2Cc0 Ngram for people skills]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business impact ==
The SCANS report states that business, labor and government authorities agree that having a wide range of people skills are necessary for 20th-century work success.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wdr.doleta.gov/SCANS/ "Secretary's Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills (SCANS)"] US Dept. of Labor. Retrieved on 2009-08-18&lt;/ref&gt; Skills like customer service, building effective relationships, and teamwork are among the abilities most requested by employers in job postings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://burning-glass.com/research/baseline-skills/ "The Human Factor: The Hard Time Employers Have Finding Soft Skills,"] Burning Glass Technologies, November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;  Lack of these skills is considered a serious psychological handicap. Constructive leadership based companies engage in helping individuals to grow, and through that growth employees take more responsibility and discharge it effectively. This in-turn will enhance the basic attitude of the individual; and that will reflect the general level of performance in workplace.  Studies indicate that many people who have difficulty in obtaining or holding a job possess the needed technical competence but lack interpersonal competence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences-and-law/economics-business-and-labor/businesses-and-occupations/human-relations|title=Human Relations facts, information, pictures {{!}} Encyclopedia.com articles about Human Relations|website=www.encyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lawrence A. Appley]] of American Management Association, reflected on these trainings as a responsibility to "increase the knowledge, sharpen and add to the skills, improve the habits, and change the attitudes of many of those for whose development we are responsible."&lt;ref&gt;Harwood F Merrill &amp; Elizabeth Marting (1952). Developing Executive Skills, American Management Association, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of people skills among upper echelons&lt;ref&gt;http://www.palgraveconnect.com/esm/doifinder/10.1057/9781137294678.0713&lt;/ref&gt; (top management) can result in [[bullying]] and/or [[harassment]], which is not uncommon in the modern workplace due to changing values. The causes that are most identified with the situation are lack of necessary motivation, communication, influencing skills and [[empathy gap]] among upper echelons (Gilbert and Thompson, 2002). Training company staff in people skills and interpersonal skills increases the morale and dignity at work (Best, 2010). Employers that do not take steps to prevent harassment can face major costs in decreased productivity, low morale, increased absenteeism and health care costs, and potential legal expenses.

The '''Pioneer plaques''' are a pair of [[gold]]-[[anodized]] [[aluminium]] [[commemorative plaque|plaques]] which were placed on board the 1972 ''[[Pioneer 10]]'' and 1973 ''[[Pioneer 11]]'' [[spacecraft]], featuring a [[pictogram|pictorial message]], in case either ''Pioneer 10'' or ''11'' is intercepted by [[extraterrestrial life]].

The ''Pioneer 10'' and ''11'' spacecraft were the first human-built [[List of artificial objects leaving the Solar System|objects to achieve escape velocity]] from the [[Solar System]]. The plaques were attached to the spacecraft's [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] support [[strut]]s in a position that would shield them from erosion by [[space dust|interstellar dust]].

==History==
The original idea, that the Pioneer spacecraft should carry a message from mankind, was first mentioned by [[Eric Burgess]]&lt;ref name="pournelle198204"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1982-04/1982_04_BYTE_07-04_Human_Factors_Engineering#page/n213/mode/2up | title=The Osborne 1, Zeke's New Friends, and Spelling Revisited | work=BYTE | date=April 1982 | accessdate=October 19, 2013 | author=Pournelle, Jerry | pages=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he visited the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] in [[Pasadena, California]], during the [[Mariner 9]] mission. He approached [[Carl Sagan]], who had lectured about communication with intelligent extraterrestrials at a conference in [[Crimea]].

Sagan was enthusiastic about the idea of sending a message with the Pioneer spacecraft. [[NASA]] agreed to the plan and gave him three weeks to prepare a message. Together with [[Frank Drake]] he designed the plaque, and the artwork was prepared by [[Linda Salzman Sagan]], who was Sagan's wife at the time.

Both plaques were manufactured at Precision Engravers, [[San Carlos, California]].

The first plaque was launched with ''Pioneer 10'' on March 2, 1972, and the second followed with ''Pioneer 11'' on April 5, 1973.

In May 2017 a limited edition of 200 replicas engraved from the original master design at Precision Engravers was made available in a [[Kickstarter]] Campaign, which also offered laser-engraved replicas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=King|first1=Duane|title=Pioneer Plaque: a Message from Earth|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/duaneking/pioneer-plaque-a-message-from-earth|website=Kickstarter.com|accessdate=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen===
[[Image:Pioneer plaque hydrogen.svg|thumb|Hyperfine transition of neutral [[hydrogen]]]]
At the top left of the plate is a schematic representation of the [[hyperfine transition]] of [[hydrogen]], which is the [[abundance of the chemical elements|most abundant element]] in the [[universe]]. The [[Hydrogen_line|spin-flip transition of a hydrogen atom’s electron]] has a [[frequency]] of about 1420.405&amp;nbsp;[[hertz|MHz]], which corresponds to a [[Frequency#Period_versus_frequency|period]] of 0.704&amp;nbsp;[[Nanosecond|ns]]. Light at this frequency has a vacuum [[wavelength]] of 21.106&amp;nbsp;[[Centimetre|cm]] (which is also the distance the light travels in that time period). Below the symbol, the small vertical line&amp;mdash;representing the [[binary numeral system|binary]] digit 1&amp;mdash;specifies a unit of length (21&amp;nbsp;cm) as well as a unit of time (0.7&amp;nbsp;ns). Both units are used as measurements in the other symbols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rosenthal|first1=Jake|title=The Pioneer Plaque: Science as a Universal Language|url=http://www.planetary.org/blogs/guest-blogs/2016/0120-the-pioneer-plaque-science-as-a-universal-language.html|website=The Planetary Society|accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

In units of the wavelength of the hyperfine transition of hydrogen this means 8 × 21&amp;nbsp;cm = 168&amp;nbsp;cm.

The right hand of the man is raised as a sign of good will. Although this gesture may not be understood, it offers a way to show the [[opposable thumb]] and how the [[Limb (anatomy)|limbs]] can be moved.&lt;!--This is at the bottom of page 22.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Cosmic" /&gt;

Originally Sagan intended the humans to be shown holding hands, but soon realized that an extraterrestrial might perceive them as a single creature rather than two organisms.&lt;!--This is at the bottom of page 22.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Cosmic" /&gt;

The original drawings of the figures were based on drawings by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and Greek sculptures.&lt;!--This is at the bottom of page 22.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Cosmic" /&gt;

The woman's [[sex organ|genitals]] are not depicted in detail; only the ''[[Mons pubis]]'' is shown. It has been claimed that Sagan, having little time to complete the plaque, suspected that NASA would have rejected a more intricate drawing and therefore made a compromise just to be safe.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Fletcher (graphic designer)|Alan Fletcher]], ''"The art of looking sideways"'', Phaidon Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-7148-3449-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Carl Sagan said that the decision to not include the vertical line on the woman's genitalia ([[pudendal cleft]]) which would be caused by the intersection of the [[labia majora]] was due to two reasons. First, Greek sculptures of women do not include that line. Second, Carl Sagan believed that a design with such an explicit depiction of a woman's genitalia would be considered too obscene to be approved by NASA.&lt;ref name="Cosmic"&gt;Sagan, C. (2009).&lt;!--The PDF version was created in 2009.--&gt; &lt;u&gt;Carl Sagan, Cosmic Connection: An Extraterrestrial Perspective, Cambridge University Press&lt;/u&gt; pp. 22-25 {{ISBN|0-521-78303-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the memoirs of [[Robert S. Kraemer]], however, the original design that was presented to NASA headquarters included a line which indicated the woman's [[vulva]],&lt;!-- This is at the top of page 80.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Wolverton" /&gt; and this line was erased as a condition for approval of the design by John Naugle, former head of NASA's Office of Space Science and the agency's former chief scientist.&lt;!-- This is at the top of page 80.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Wolverton" /&gt;{{clear}}

===Relative position of the Sun to the center of the Galaxy and 14 pulsars===
[[Image:Pioneer plaque sun.svg|thumb|Relative position of the [[Sun]] to the center of the [[Galaxy]] and 14 [[pulsar]]s with their periods denoted]]
The radial pattern on the left of the plaque shows 15 lines emanating from the same [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]]. Fourteen of the lines have corresponding long binary numbers, which stand for the [[Frequency|periods]] of [[pulsar]]s, using the hydrogen spin-flip transition frequency as the unit. Since these periods will change over time, the [[epoch (astronomy)|epoch]] of the launch can be calculated from these values.

The lengths of the lines show the relative distances of the pulsars to the [[Sun]]. A tick mark at the end of each line gives the Z coordinate perpendicular to the [[galactic plane]].

If the plaque is found, only some of the pulsars may be visible from the location of its discovery. Showing the location with as many as 14 pulsars provides redundancy so that the location of the origin can be [[triangulation|triangulated]] even if only some of the pulsars are recognized.

The data for one of the pulsars is misleading. When the plaque was designed, the frequency of pulsar "1240" (now known as J1243-6423) was known to only three significant decimal digits: 0.388 second.&lt;ref name=Sagan1972 /&gt; The map lists the period of this pulsar in binary to much greater precision: 100000110110010110001001111000. Rounding this off at about 10 significant bits (100000110100000000000000000000) would have provided a hint of this uncertainty. This pulsar is represented by the long line pointing down and to the right.

The fifteenth line on the plaque extends to the far right, behind the human figures. This line indicates the Sun's relative distance to the center of the galaxy.

The pulsar map and hydrogen atom diagram are shared in common with the [[Voyager Golden Record]].

===Solar System===
[[Image:Pioneer plaque solar system.svg|thumb|The [[Solar System]] with the trajectory of the Pioneer spacecraft]]
At the bottom of the plaque is a schematic [[diagram]] of the Solar System. A small picture of the spacecraft is shown, and the [[trajectory]] shows its way past [[Jupiter]] and out of the Solar System. Both ''Pioneers 10'' and ''11'' have identical plaques; however, after launch, Pioneer 11 was redirected toward [[Saturn]] and from there it exited the Solar System. In this regard the ''Pioneer 11'' plaque is somewhat inaccurate.
The Saturn flyby of ''Pioneer 11'' would also greatly influence its future direction and destination as compared to ''Pioneer 10'', but this fact is not depicted in the plaques.

Saturn's rings could give a further hint to identifying the Solar System. [[Planetary ring|Rings]] around the planets Jupiter, [[Uranus]], and [[Neptune]] were unknown when the plaque was designed; however, unlike Saturn, the ring systems on these planets are not so easily visible and apparent as Saturn's. [[Pluto]] was considered to be a planet when the plaque was designed; in 2006 the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] reclassified Pluto as a [[dwarf planet]] and then in 2008 as a [[plutoid]]. Other large bodies classed as dwarf planets, such as [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], are not depicted, as they were unknown at the time the plaque was made.

The binary numbers above and below the [[planet]]s show the relative distance to the Sun. The unit is 1/10 of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]'s orbit. Rather than the familiar "1" and "0", "I" and "-" are used.

===Silhouette of the spacecraft===
[[Image:Pioneer plaque spacecraft.svg|thumb|Silhouette of the Pioneer spacecraft relative to the size of the humans]]
Behind the figures of the human beings, the [[silhouette]] of the Pioneer spacecraft is shown in the same [[scale (spatial)|scale]] so that the size of the human beings can be deduced by measuring the spacecraft.

== Criticism ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Voyager Golden Record]] --&gt;

One of the parts of the diagram that is among the easiest for humans to understand may be among the hardest for the extraterrestrial finders to understand: the [[Arrow_(symbol)|arrow]] showing the trajectory of Pioneer. An article in ''[[Scientific American]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernst Gombrich]] ‘The Visual Image’, 1972 in Scientific American (eds {{clarify|date=August 2013}}) ''Communication''. San Francisco, California, Freeman, pp. 46–60; originally in a special issue of Scientific American, September 1972; republished in Gombrich (1982) ''The Image and the Eye: Further Studies in the Psychology of Pictorial Representation'', London, Phaidon, pp. 137–61.&lt;/ref&gt; criticized the use of an arrow because arrows are an artifact of hunter-gatherer societies like those on Earth; finders with a different cultural heritage may find the arrow symbol meaningless.

Art critic and activist [[Craig Owens (critic)|Craig Owens]] said that sexual bias is exhibited by the choice to make the man in the diagram perform the [[Wave (gesture)|wave]] gesture to greet the extraterrestrials while the woman in the diagram has her hands at her sides.&lt;!--This is at the bottom of page 176. Bogue (1991) is being used as a secondary source for this criticism from Owens (1983).--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bogue, R. (1991). &lt;u&gt;Mimesis in Contemporary Theory: (vol. 2) Mimesis, semiosis, and power&lt;/u&gt;. USA: John Benjamins Publishing Company. pp. 176. {{ISBN|1-55619-150-2}} (hb.) (v. 2 : US)&lt;/ref&gt; Feminists also took issue with this choice for the same reason.&lt;!--This is at the bottom of page 92.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Achenbach"&gt;Achenbach, J. (1999). &lt;u&gt;Captured by Aliens: The Search for Life and Truth in a Very Large Universe&lt;/u&gt; New York, NY: Citadel Press Books. pp. 92. {{ISBN|0-8065-2496-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carl Sagan regretted that the figures in the finished engraving failed to look panracial. Although this was the intent, the final figures appeared Caucasian.&lt;!--This is at the bottom of page 92.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Achenbach" /&gt; In the original drawing, the man was drawn with an "Afro" haircut, so an additional African physical trait would be included in the man to make the figures look more panracial, but that detail was changed to a "non-African Mediterranean-curly haircut" in the finished engraving.&lt;!--This is in the middle of page 297.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gepper, A.C.T. (2012). &lt;u&gt;Imagining Outer Space: European Astroculture in the Twentieth Century&lt;/u&gt;. New York, NY: Smithsonian Institution. pp. 297. {{ISBN|978-0-230-23172-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Carl Sagan said that Linda Sagan intended to portray both the man and woman as having brown hair, but the hair being only outlined rather than being both outlined and shaded made the hair appear blonde instead.&lt;!--This is at the top of page 74.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spangenburg, R. &amp; Moser, K. (2004). &lt;u&gt;Carl Sagan: A Biography&lt;/u&gt; USA: Greenwood Press. pp. 74. {{ISBN|0-313-32265-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other people had different interpretations of the race of people depicted by the figures. Whites, blacks and Asians each tended to think that the figures resembled their own racial group, so, although some people were proud that their race appeared to have been selected to represent all of humankind, others viewed the figures as "terribly racist" for "the apparently blatant exclusion" of other races.&lt;!--This is in the middle of page 82.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Wolverton" /&gt;

Linda Sagan decided to make the figures nude to address the problem of the type of clothes they should wear to represent all of humanity and to make the figures more anatomically educational for extraterrestrials,&lt;!--This is at the bottom of page 79.--&gt; but their nudity was viewed as pornographic by the American media.&lt;!--This is in the middle of page 80.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Wolverton"&gt;Wolverton, M.

The writer is being sarcastic in second and third paragraphs of page 24. Using sarcasm, the writer is mocking the prudishness which led to the censorship of the woman's vulva rather than supporting the censorship.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Cosmic" /&gt;

==Fiction==
{{trivia|date=May 2017}}
{{ref-improve|section|date=May 2017}}
;Star Trek
*In the ''Star Trek Encyclopedia'' paperback – International Edition, October 1, 1999, the plaque is shown with Pioneer launching from the second planet rather than the third. 
* In the science fiction film ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'', the plaque's diagram is fleetingly shown during Spock's mindmeld with V'ger, a transformed [[NASA]] space probe, ''Voyager 6''. This style of plaque was not used in the two actual NASA probes in the [[Voyager program]].
*In ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'', the plaque appears on the viewing screen when a signal is sent by Rain Robinson trying to communicate with ''Voyager''. 16 minutes and 28 seconds into episode 8 season 3 Future's End.
* In the science fiction film ''[[Star Trek V: The Final Frontier]]'', the plaque is shown attached to a Pioneer probe floating in space—just before the probe is intercepted and destroyed by a bored [[Klingon]] ship captain, who scoffs "Shooting space garbage is no test of a warrior's mettle." However the plaque is erroneously depicted as facing outwards rather than inwards.
* In the ''Star Trek'' novel ''Federation'', a character mentions that humans had shown copies of the plaque to several alien races they encountered, but none had been able to decode it.

;Other
* In "[[The Message (The Outer Limits)|The Message]]," an episode of the science fiction series ''[[The Outer Limits (1995 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'', a deaf woman was featured receiving alien signals through her [[cochlear implant]], prompting her to write out Xs, 1s, and 0s on paper. When put together, the Xs turned into the images of the man and woman from the plaque, along with an extraterrestrial humanoid raising a hand in a peaceful gesture.
* On her album ''[[United States Live]]'', American performance artist [[Laurie Anderson (performance artist)|Laurie Anderson]] contemplates extraterrestrials finding the plaque and asks "do you think that they will think his arm is permanently attached in this position?"
* In the ''[[Futurama]]'' episode "[[Godfellas]]," the robot Bender finds himself doomed to drift through space, during which time he etches a modified version of the Pioneer plaque, with himself towering menacingly over the human figures, so that "When I'm found in a million years, people will know what the score was."
* In ''[[Buck Rogers]]'' season 1, episode 15 "Ardala Returns," Princess Ardala constructs a fake probe (allegedly launched in 1996) that utilizes a copy of the plaque in order to trick Buck into thinking the probe was from his own time period — the distant past.
* In the [[L. Ron Hubbard]] novel ''[[Battlefield Earth (novel)|Battlefield Earth]]'', it is mentioned by the principal alien character that his race's conquest of Earth was made possible by their discovery of a space probe "that gave full directions to the place, had pictures of man on it and everything".
* In "[[Beware My Cheating Bart]]" (18th episode of Season 23) of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', the plaque was briefly shown at the end of the episode. It was depicted with an extraterrestrial holding the plaque upside down, obviously confused by its strange depictions.
* The plaque is used as the artwork for the album ''Aufheben'' by [[the Brian Jonestown Massacre]] and for ''Accept the Signal'' by [[Regular Fries]].
* A drawing which bears a strong likeness to the one depicted in the plaque was used as the artwork for [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[avant-garde metal]] band [[Arcturus (band)|Arcturus]]' album ''[[Sideshow Symphonies]]''.
* A character in ''[[Kamen Rider Gaim]]'' uses a package containing language dictionaries and a modified version of the plaque to later communicate with an other-dimensional sentient race.
* In the TV show ''[[Eureka (U.S. TV series)|Eureka]]'', on episode 5 of season 2 (Duck Duck Goose), the plaque is shown as part of the debris that lands on Earth.
* In the TV show ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'', on episode 21 of season 8 (The Communication Deterioration), the plaque is mentioned when they are discussing ideas about sending a message to alien races in space.
* In the video game by [[Paradox Development Studio]], ''[[Stellaris (video game)|Stellaris]]'', one of the scientific missions discovers the plaque on an alien world in the distant future.
* The Pioneer plaque appears in the booklet of [[David Bowie]]'s 2016 album ''[[Blackstar (album)|Blackstar]]'', on the page for the song "[[Girl Loves Me]]".
* The Pioneer plaque appears in 01 - Welcome / Orientation briefing video of the Mass Effect Andromeda Initiative website. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.masseffect.com/andromeda-initiative/&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[17776]] has ''Pioneer 10'' (named Ten in the story) as a sentient being who is made fun of by ''[[Pioneer 9]]'' (Nine) and ''[[Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer]]'' (JUICE) for being sent into space with a plaque displaying naked humans.
* In the [[Wii U]] title, ''[[Xenoblade Chronicles X]]'', the plaque is seen in the opening cut scene, damaged and floating in midspace, before one of the alien ships that later approaches Earth.
* [[Edwin_Morgan_(poet)|Edwin Morgan]]'s poem, "Translunar Space March 1972", refers to Pioneer 10, and passes critical commentary on the images on the plaque: "A deodorized American man / with apologetic genitals and no pubic hair / holds up a banana-like right hand"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Collected Poems |authors=Edwin Morgan |year=1997 |publisher=Carcanet Press |location=Manchester |isbn=978-1-857541-88-5 |pages=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Prentiss "Print" Matthews''' (August 27, 1840 &amp;ndash; November 6, 1883) was an American [[sheriff]] and social reformer of the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] era. An advocate for [[African American]] rights in [[Copiah County, Mississippi]], he was murdered while voting in 1883 after defying the orders of local [[White supremacy|white supremacist]] Democrats, who told him not to vote.

==Education and family life==
Matthews, best known by the nickname "Print", was born on August 27, 1840,near [[Hazlehurst, Mississippi|Hazlehurst]], [[Mississippi]], the Copiah County seat.

==Career==
Although his parents were wealthy and owned 35 slaves. Matthews supported the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]]. During the [[American Civil War]], most local whites supported the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]].

After the war, Matthews ran a store and was elected the county sheriff. When [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] regained power in the state government in 1875, Matthews helped organize the Independent Party in Copiah County, consisting of black and white farmers. However, in 1881, Democrats began night riding to intimidate African Americans and attempt to suppress their voting, and Matthews lost his bid for re-election by 84 votes, as Democrats claimed a mule had reached through a window and eaten all the ballots from Mt. Hope precinct, primarily African American and supportive of Matthews (although 2 blacks remained on the county council).&lt;ref&gt;James Loewen, Lies across America: What our Historic Sites get Wrong (New York: the New Press, 1999) pp. 231-2&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1883, the night rides grew worse, although the Independent Party slate only included one black. Ablack church was burned and a husband and wife murdered on October 26. The riders ordered voters not to vote for the Independent Party in the upcoming 1883 elections; and blacks and some whites even spent the night before the election in the woods for fear of further intimidation tactics.&lt;ref&gt;Loewen p. 233&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
The white Democratic leaders of Hazlehurst delivered a written ultimatum to Matthews, ordering him not to vote. When he persisted, the precinct captain, a white farmer and doctor named [[Erastus Benjamin Wheeler]] (1840-1900, nicknamed "Ras") who had an account at Matthews' store, reached inside a wooden box for a double-barreled shotgun and shot and killed Matthews at the polls.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/?id=pboJAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA157&amp;dq=The+Republican+Campaign+Textbook+Print+Matthews ''The Republican Campaign Textbook for 1884''], New York: Republican National Committee, 1884; pp. 156–160.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thepastwhispers.com/ALHN_Copiah_County.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The evening after his murder, Matthews' political enemies, organized in a local group known as the "Trail-Hold Club", gathered in the yard of his residence. They mocked and celebrated the killing.&lt;ref name=Flower&gt;Frank Abial Flower, [https://books.google.com/books?id=VmkFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA449&amp;lpg=PA449&amp;dq=print+matthews+1883+copiah&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=print%20matthews%201883%20copiah&amp;f=false ''History of the Republican Party: Embracing Its Origin, Growth and Mission''], Grand Rapids, MI: Union Book Company, 1884; pg. 449.&lt;/ref&gt; A mass meeting "resolved" that the Matthews family "shall keep out of politics in Copiah county" and some talked of having Wheeler run for governor. Wheeler was elected marshal of Hazlehurst, Meanwhile, the gravedigger who had helped bury Matthews on his own property was threatened and left town, as did the Matthews family (though some members including his then-15 year old son later returned).&lt;ref&gt;Lowen p. 233&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trial===
After a special investigation, Wheeler was tried in May 1884. The ''New York Times'' covered the trial. The carefully chosen, all-white jury quickly returned a verdict of not guilty, much to the pleasure and expectation of the judge and the community. The jury posted a statement noting that if an "error" occurred, it was "one of the head, and not of the heart."

J.T. Dameron, a merchant, testified that he saw Ras Wheeler in a street car in the capital of [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]] on the 13th or 14th of February. He said that Wheeler was talking in a low tone. He said; "Yes, old [[Samuel Hoar|Hoar]] is coming down here on an investigation committee. If I get a crack at him I will kill him, too. I killed Print Matthews, or rather it was the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic party]] that did it. If it had not been for politics, I would not have done it; but it was politics that did it."&lt;ref name=Flower /&gt;

Ras Wheeler went on to have a successful political career in the state.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E05E7D6113BE033A25757C1A9639C94659FD7CF "The Election Murder Trial"], ''New York Times,'' May 14, 1884.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===
Matthews was survived by his wife Mary "Tine" Barlow, whom he had married on June 6, 1862. Their son [[John Prentiss Matthews, Jr.]] carried on his father's principles and became a leader in Republican politics. President Benjamin Harrison made him postmaster of a town 130 miles away, [[Carrollton, Mississippi]]. On Christmas Day, 1890, local Democrats shot the 22 year old dead.&lt;ref&gt;Loewen p. 234&lt;/ref&gt; Another son, Simon Matthews, became an activist in the [[People's Party (United States)|People's Party]] during the 1890s, when a biracial coalition temporarily elected some positions, defeating the Democrats.

The '''privileged positions of business and science''' refer to the unique authority that persons in these areas hold in economic, political, and technosocial affairs. Businesses have strong decision-making abilities in the function of society, essentially choosing what technological innovations to develop. Scientists and technologists have valuable knowledge and the ability to pursue the technological innovations they want. They proceed largely without public scrutiny and as if they had the consent of those potentially affected by their discoveries and creations.

== Privileged position of business ==

Businesses have considerable power in decision-making processes in business-oriented societies. High level executives make discrete decisions about technological innovation without regard to consequences. Political scientist Edward Woodhouse states that businesses make key economic decisions that include creating jobs, choosing industrial plant and equipment, and deciding which new products to develop and market.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|2006|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, businesses hold a privileged position related to politics in the sense that they are capable of considerable influence over key public choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|2006|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leadership role that business has in the economy gives executives of large corporations an unusual kind of degree of influence over governmental policy making.&lt;ref name="Lindblom_91"&gt;{{harvp|Lindblom|Woodhouse|1993|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Government officials have incentives to carry out businesses' demands. They know that failure of businesses to maintain high employment will upset voters more quickly than anything else.&lt;ref name="Lindblom_91"/&gt; Our economy functions as a chain effect. Businesses that get what they want provide plentiful jobs and stimulate cash flow in the economy. As a result, citizens are happy, and this happiness translates to more trust and faith in the government party. Government officials thus have a higher chance of reelection.

It is clear that the businesses have the most influence in this chain effect. If a business fails, jobs are lost, citizens are unhappy, and the government party loses trust and their chance of reelection. One example of this was President Bush’s plummeting popularity and resulting defeat by Bill Clinton.&lt;ref name="Lindblom_91"/&gt; Therefore, it would make sense for government officials to reach out to these executives and provide valuable resources to benefit both parties. Power is shifted from government officials to business executives, because these executives have the ability to influence government officials to meet their demands. As a result, a large category of decisions is turned over to businessmen, and taken off the agenda of government. In a way, business managers become the public officials they represent.

This privilege of power is unique to corporations only. If workers want reform on unfair working conditions or pay, they must form a worker’s union. However, a worker’s union has considerably less influence than a corporation. As opposed to workers’ unions, businesses exercise more control on governmental policy making because workers are expendable – workers need money more urgently than society needs their services, so a business can operate for a lot longer than workers can afford to stay off the job.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lindblom|Woodhouse|1993|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Privileged position of science ==

Without the knowledge of scientists and technologists, there would be no possibility of producing new technology and progress in a positive manner. Those who have these types of  knowledge and abilities are essentially the "seed" of technological innovation. They have the following three privileges:

*Knowledge
*Learning and teaching of new knowledge 
*Political implications of innovation

Based on previous scientific knowledge, one or several are able to use it and/or build on it to innovate. Kleinman and Vallas, point out that scientists control the modification, mediation and contest of emerging knowledge.&lt;ref name="Woodhouse_153"&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|2006|p=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those with this knowledge can also teach future generations the same to keep this process moving forward. Woodhouse that states that engineers are among the top professionals that promote the new innovations without consequences.&lt;ref name="Woodhouse_1997"&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|1997|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the foundation of the privileged position of science, that only a select have scientific and/or technological knowledge and capable of substantial feats, good or bad. Engineers and scientists have the powerful position of being able to choose the path of innovation for emerging technology. Technologists and scientists hold a privileged position additionally in that their innovations often have political implications. Woodhouse makes the comparison of innovation to legislative acts, stating that they both establish a framework that will follow for many generations.&lt;ref name="Woodhouse_1997"/&gt;

== Relationships between privileged positions of business and science ==

Business and science are part of an important societal circle specifically relating to the production and implementation of technology. In simple terms, scientists and technologists design and create, while businesses provide the means to create, produce and implement. As Woodhouse claims, it would be a mistake to overlook business executives' and elected officials' dependence on the technologists because innovation is so highly regarded.&lt;ref name="Woodhouse_153"/&gt;

Businesses that rely on scientists and technologists cannot function without them, but have authority over them. Woodhouse claims that the one reason green technology has not emerged faster and stronger is because the brown chemistry formula fulfilled many of the needs of scientists and businessmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|2006|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, since brown chemistry was innovated over less toxic and recyclable green technologies, it is shown that business has more authority over that of technologists and scientists. Woodhouse points out that there has been considerable delay on a promising area of green chemistry: supercritical fluids. The opinions range from targeting the culprit as the complexity of the equipment, to maintenance difficulties, to the equipment costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|2006|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an example of the interconnection of business and science, and how technology can be slowed by technology and/or business (and vice versa). Woodhouse also states that twentieth-century chemists, chemical engineers, and chemical industry executives made central decisions which considerably modeled society's experiences with chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|2006|p=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chemical industry, which includes scientists, technologists, and businessmen, uniquely controls what happens or what can happen to large number of people who are exposed to chemicals.

Business and science are considered of utmost importance in current developed countries. However, one working without the other has the potential to cause major issues. Woodhouse points out what the vice president of Shaw Carpets explained at a congressional hearing: that the V.P. is the person whose job it is to tell the chemists and chemical engineers that it is possible to produce carpets using "green" processes, because the students had not learned this from their respective university curricula.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|2006|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; There can be many positive outcomes of the unison operation of business and science, and it is vital that this does occur in order to prevent major problems and unintended consequences.

'''Public humiliation''' or '''public shaming''' is a form of [[punishment]] whose main feature is [[Dishonor|dishonoring]] or disgracing a person, usually an offender or a [[prisoner]], especially in a public place. It was regularly used as a form of judicially sanctioned punishment in previous centuries, and is still practiced by different means in the modern era.

In the United States, it was a common punishment from the beginning of [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonization]] through the 19th century.  It fell out of common use in the 20th century, though it has seen a revival starting in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2000-04-12/news/0004120235_1_unusual-punishment-humiliation-sentencing&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shameful exposure ==
[[File:Edmondaviv2014.jpg|thumb|A man (Edmond Aviv) sits down in punishment, sentenced by judge, holding up a sign that says he was a [[Bullying|bully]] for bullying children with disabilities.]]


Public humiliation exists in many forms. Most often a criminal was placed in the center of town and having the local populace enact a form of "[[mob justice]]" on the individual. [[File:Flute of Shame Torture Museum Amsterdam.jpg|thumb|left|Flute of Shame displayed at the [[Torture museum|Torture Museum]] in [[Amsterdam]].]]

The punishment of public humiliation could be, amongst other things, an offender being forced to relate his crime, such as by exaggerated physical parody: a 'shame [[flute]]' for a bad musician or wearing a giant [[rosary]] ({{lang-nl|schandstenen}}, "stones of shame") for someone late to church. The offender could alternatively be sentenced to remain exposed in a specific public place, in a restraining device.

In the [[Netherlands|Low Countries]], the {{lang|nl|schandstoel}} ("Chair of shame"), the {{lang|nl|kaak}} or {{lang|nl|schandpaal}} ("pole of shame", a simple type of [[pillory]]), the {{lang|nl|draaikooi}} were customary for [[Adultery|adulteresses]], and the {{lang|nl|schopstoel}}, a [[scaffold]]ing from which one is kicked off to land in [[mud]] and dirt.

In the more extreme cases being subjected to [[verbal abuse|verbal]] and [[physical abuse]] from the crowd, which could have serious consequences especially when the hands are not free to protect himself. Some sentences actually prescribe additional humiliation, such as shaving, or combine it with painful corporal punishments, see below.&lt;ref name="williamsburg"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.history.org/foundation/journal/spring03/branks.cfm | title=Bilboes, Brands, and Branks: Colonial Crimes and Punishments | author=Cox, James | journal=Colonial Williamsburg Journal |date=Spring 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Colonial America]], common forms of public humiliation were the [[stocks]] and [[pillory]], imported from [[Europe]]. Nearly every sizable town had such instruments of public humiliation, usually at the town square. Historic public humiliation displays can still be seen in the historic [[Virginia]] town of [[Colonial Williamsburg]].[[File:Man and woman undergoing public exposure for adultery in Japan-J. M. W. Silver.jpg|thumb|Man and woman undergoing public exposure for adultery in Japan, around 1860.]]In pre–World War Japan, [[adulterer]]s were publicly exposed purely to shame them.

In post-Colonial times, judicial use of public humiliation punishment has largely fallen out of favor since the practice is now considered [[cruel and unusual punishment]], which is outlawed in the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref name="ziel"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.law2.byu.edu/jpl/papers/v19n2_Paul_Ziel.pdf | title=Eighteenth Century Public Humiliation Penalties in Twenty-First Century America: The 'Shameful' Return of 'Scarlet Letter' Punishments in ''U.S. v.

In [[Thailand|Siam]], an adulteress was paraded with a [[hibiscus]] behind the ear. Thieves were tattooed on their faces. Other criminals were paraded with a device made of woven cane on the forehead, or lengths of bamboo hung around the neck. Errant Brahmans had to wear a string of oversize beads.

Just like painful forms of corporal punishment, it has parallels in educational and other rather private punishments (but with some audience), in school or domestic disciplinary context, and as a [[rite of passage]]. Physical forms include being forced to wear some sign such as "donkey ears" (simulated in paper, as a sign one is—or at least behaved—proverbially stupid), wearing a [[dunce cap]], having to stand, kneel or bend over in a corner, or repeatedly write something on a blackboard ("I will not spread rumors", for example). Here different levels of physical discomfort can be added, such as having to hold heavy objects, go barefoot (see below) or kneel on an uneven surface. Like physical punishment and harsh hazing, these have become controversial in most modern societies, in many cases leading to legal restrictions and/or (sometimes voluntary) abolishment.[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1971-041-10, Paris, der Kollaboration beschuldigte Französinnen.jpg|thumb|alt=photograph|Paris 1944: French women accused of collaboration with Nazis had their heads shaved and were paraded through the streets barefoot.]]Having the [[Head shaving|head shaved]] can be a humiliating punishment prescribed in law,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wluml.org/node/3908 ''"Article 87 ... shall be sentenced to flogging, having his head shaven, and one year of exile..."''], The Islamic Penal Code of the Islamic Republic of Iran&lt;/ref&gt; but also something done as "mob justice" - a stark example of which was the thousands of European women who had their heads shaved in front of cheering crowds in the wake of World War II,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Antony Beevor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jun/05/women-victims-d-day-landings-second-world-war |title="An Ugly Carnival" |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2014-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Shorn Women: Gender and Punishment in Liberation France", {{ISBN|978-1-85973-584-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; as punishment for associating with occupying [[Nazism|Nazis]] during the war.[[File:Slave dance to banjo, 1780s.jpg|thumb|Modern era slaves typically had to go barefoot by regulation in slave codes (colonial United States, 1780s).]]Forcing people to go [[barefoot#Imprisonment and slavery|barefoot]] has been used as a relatively effortless and more subtle form of humiliation in most past and present civilized cultures, primarily using the visual contrast to the standard form of appearance while also creating some level of physical discomfort.

It usually also causes a considerable degree of humiliation, as this noticeable detail typically sets the prisoner apart from spectators visually and demonstrates the person's vulnerability and general powerlessness.

Further means of public humiliation and degradation consist in forcing people to wear typifying clothes, which can be penitential garbs or [[prison uniform]]s.

Presenting arrestees or prisoners to the public in restraints (such as [[handcuffs]], [[legcuffs|shackles]] or similar devices) also serves as a convenient{{how|date=September 2017}} method of public humiliation besides the primary security aspects. The effect is complemented by presenting the person in a prison uniform or similar clothing.{{example needed}}

== Corporal punishment ==
[[File:Antoin Sevruguin 12 Falak Whipping the soles of a criminal.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Public [[foot whipping]] in Iran]]
[[File:Supplice du Grand Knout.jpg|thumb|Public [[flagellation]] in Russia, 18th century.]]
[[File:Pelourinho.jpg|thumb|Public flogging in Brazil, [[Jean-Baptiste Debret]]]]
Apart from specific methods essentially aiming at humiliation, several methods combine pain and humiliation or even death and humiliation. In some cases, pain or at least discomfort is insignificant or rather secondary to the humiliation.

=== Public punishment ===
The simplest is to administer painful [[corporal punishment]] in public - the major aim may be [[deterrence (psychological)|deterrence]] of potential offenders - so the public will witness the perpetrator's fear and agony. This can either take place in a [[town square]] or other public gathering location such as a school, or take the form of a procession through the streets. This was not uncommon in the sentences to ''Staupenschlag'' (whipping or [[birching]], generally on the bare [[buttocks]]) in various [[German language|German-speaking]] states, till the 19th century. A naval equivalent was [[Cat o' nine tails#Flogging round the fleet|Flogging round the fleet]] on a raft taken from ship to ship for consecutive installments of a great total of lashes, that could even be lethal. In some countries the punishment of [[foot whipping]] is executed in public to this day.

*The humiliation as well as degradation is generally intensified if the perpetrator is unclothed (partially or entirely) as the exposure leaves the person feeling vulnerable and helpless. A common and simple form of humiliating exposure consists in taking away a person's shoes and keeping him or her [[barefoot]] during corporal punishment or generally.
*Further means of intensifying the public humiliation and degradation especially during punishment consist in forcing people to wear typifying clothes, which can be [[prison uniform]]s or in former times penitential garbs or rags, further incremented in combination with an exposure aspect such as bare feet.
*Even when not strictly public, humiliation can still be a psychologically "painful" aspect of punishment because of the presence of witnessing peers (such as fellow prisoners), staff or other onlookers, or simply because the person administering the punishment is witnessing the reactions of the culprit. The loss of self-control in the presence of bystanders further increments the humiliating effect of the punishment significantly. This is also true for punishments in class and similar situations.
*[[Crucifixion]] was used by the Romans to add public humiliation to a [[death penalty]]. [[Josephus]] describes how the Roman soldiers would crucify people naked, and using different tortuous positions as a way to further humiliate them. Crucified bodies were left to decay on the cross for weeks, and crows would come to feed on the corpses; this can be seen as post-mortem public humiliation. See also [[gibbeting]].
&lt;!--*{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}Public shaving was also applied to (true or alleged) collaborators after the [[Allies of World War II|Allied liberated]] occupied territories from the [[Storm Troopers|Nazi troops]]; being thus marked, they would remain in danger from [[molestation]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}--&gt;

=== Torture marks ===
[[File:Philip Dawe (attributed), The Bostonians Paying the Excise-man, or Tarring and Feathering (1774) - 02.jpg|thumb|The 1774 [[tarring and feathering]] of British customs agent [[John Malcolm (Loyalist)|John Malcolm]] soon after the [[Boston Tea Party]] ]]

The humiliation can be extended; intentionally or not; by leaving visible marks, such as [[scar]]s, notably on body parts that are normally left visible. This also serves as a virtually indelible criminal record. This can even be the main intention of the punishment, as in the case of [[scarification]]s, such as [[branding persons|branding]]. It invariably is essential in forms of mutilation, such as [[cropping (punishment)|ear cropping]], though the functional loss is even greater; pain may even be intentionally minimized as in the case of surgical amputation, eliminating the risk of accidental death. [[Tarring and feathering]] also serves as means of extended humiliation.

== Psychological effects ==
{{main|Humiliation#Psychological effects}}
Public shaming can result in negative psychological effects and devastating consequences, regardless of the punishment being justifiable or not. It could cause depression, suicidal thoughts and other severe mental problems. The humiliated individuals may develop a variety of symptoms including apathy, paranoia, anxiety, PTSD, etc. The rage and fury may arise in the persecuted individual, themselves lashing out against innocent victims, as they seek revenge or as a means of release.

'''Public water system''' is a regulatory term used in the United States and Canada, referring to certain [[Public utility|utilities]] and organizations providing [[drinking water]].

==United States==
The US [[Safe Drinking Water Act]] and derivative legislation define "public water system" as an entity that provides "[[Drinking water|water for human consumption]] through pipes or other constructed conveyances to at least 15 service connections or serves an average of at least 25 people for at least 60 days a year."&lt;ref name="SDWA background"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/dwstandardsregulations/background-drinking-water-standards-safe-drinking-water-act-sdwa |title=Background on Drinking Water Standards in the Safe Drinking Water Act |date=2015-12-23 |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "public" in "public water system" refers to the people drinking the water, not to the ownership of the system.

Some US states (e.g. [[New York (state)|New York]]) have varying definitions.
&lt;!-- The [[European Union]] appears to have a different definition for "public water '''supply'''": a water supply which is in the charge or ownership of a sanitary authority or any person acting jointly with it or on its behalf under contract.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fsai.ie/legislation/food/eu_docs/Water/SI278_2007.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

Over 286 million Americans get their tap water from a community water system. Eight percent of the community water systems—large municipal water systems—provide water to 82 percent of the US population.&lt;ref name="CDCPWS"&gt;U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, GA (2013-04-04). [https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/public/index.html "Public Water Systems."]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subcategorization===
The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has defined three types of public water systems:
* '''Community Water System''' (CWS). A public water system that supplies water to the same population year-round.
* '''Non-Transient Non-Community Water System''' (NTNCWS). A public water system that regularly supplies water to at least 25 of the same people at least six months per year, but not year-round. Some examples are schools, factories, office buildings, and [[hospital]]s which have their own water systems.
* '''Transient Non-Community Water System''' (TNCWS). A public water system that provides water in a place such as a [[gas station]] or [[campground]] where people do not remain for long periods of time.

There are over 150,000 public water systems.
* Approximately 52,000 CWS serve the majority of the U.S. population
* Approximately 85,000 NTNCWS
* Approximately 18,000 TNCWS.&lt;ref name="SDWA background"/&gt;

EPA also classifies water systems according to the number of people they serve:
* Very Small water systems serve 25-500 people
* Small water systems serve 501-3,300 people
* Medium water systems serve 3,301-10,000 people
* Large water systems serve 10,001-100,000 people
* Very Large water systems serve over 100,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://echo.epa.gov/help/drinking-water-dashboard-help |title=Drinking Water Dashboard Help |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016-01-05 |website=Enforcement and Compliance History Online |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water systems may be categorized by their source of water:
*[[Groundwater]], generally from [[Water well|wells]]
*[[Surface water]] and groundwater "under the influence" of surface water
*Purchase of water from another Public Water System.

===Water-related diseases and contaminants in public water systems===
Sources of drinking water are subject to contamination and require appropriate treatment to remove disease-causing contaminants. Contamination of drinking water supplies can occur in the source water as well as in the distribution system after water treatment has already occurred. There are many sources of water contamination, including naturally occurring chemicals and minerals (for example, [[arsenic]], [[radon]], [[uranium]]), local land use practices (application of [[fertilizer]]s and [[pesticide]]s; [[concentrated animal feeding operation]]s), manufacturing processes, and [[Sewer overflow (disambiguation)|sewer overflow]]s&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt; or [[water pollution|wastewater]] releases.

The presence of contaminants in water can lead to adverse health effects, including gastrointestinal illness, reproductive problems, and neurological disorders.

== Theories ==
[[Homi K. Bhabha]] explains racial fetishism as a version of racist stereotyping, which is woven into colonial discourse and based on multiple/contradictory and splitting beliefs, similar to the disavowal which Freud discusses.  Bhabha defines colonial discourse as that which activates the simultaneous "recognition and disavowal of racial/cultural/historical differences" and whose goal is to define the colonized as 'other,' but also as fixed and knowable stereotypes. Racial fetishism involves contradictory belief systems where the 'other' is both demonized and idolized.&lt;ref name="Bhabha" /&gt;

Feminist writer [[Anne McClintock]] is interested in opening up the discourse of fetishism to stray away from the phallus and the scene of castration. One of her central arguments is that although race, class, and gender are all different and articulated categories of being, they always exist "''in and through'' relation to each other," and therefore discussions of racial fetishism also always have to do with class and gender as well.&lt;ref name="McClintock" /&gt;  McClintock does

&lt;blockquote&gt;not see racial fetishism as stemming from an overdetermined relation to the castration scene. Reducing racial fetishism to the phallic drama runs the risk of flattening out the hierarchies of social difference, thereby relegating race and class to secondary status along a primarily sexual signifying chain".&lt;ref name=McClintock /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fetishism can take multiple forms and has branched off to incorporate different races. English naturalist and geologist, [[Charles Darwin]], can offer some observations in regards to why some people might find other races more attractive than their own. Attraction can be viewed as a mechanism for choosing a healthy mate. People's minds have evolved to recognize aspects of other peoples' biology that makes them an appropriate or good mate. This area of theory is called optimal outbreeding hypothesis.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2014/05/13/cross-cultural-dating-why-are-some-people-only-attracted-one-ethnicity|title=Cross-cultural dating: Why are some people only attracted to one ethnicity?|work=News|access-date=2017-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples==
=== White women ===
==== Fetishism of white women in China ====
[[File:Slavoj Zizek Fot M Kubik May15 2009 10.jpg|thumb|Slavoj Zizek (2009)]]
Following the globalization of China, the perception of Westerners changed drastically. As China opened up to the outside world, representations of Westerners shifted from enemies of China to individuals of great power, money and pleasure.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johansson|first=Perry|date=1999-11-01|title=Consuming the other: The fetish of the western woman in Chinese advertising and popular culture|journal=Postcolonial Studies|volume=2|issue=3|pages=377–388|doi=10.1080/13688799989661|issn=1368-8790}}&lt;/ref&gt; The white woman, according to [[Slavoj Žižek]], Slovenian psychoanalytic philosopher and researcher at the [[University of Ljubljana]], has become fetishized in modern Chinese society as a result of her perceived role in the globalized commodity culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Plague of Fantasies|last=Zizek|first=Slavoj|publisher=Verso|year=1997|isbn=978-1844673032|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study of Chinese advertisements from 1990 to 1995, marketed solely to the Chinese people, it was concluded that in China, white women are symbols of strength and sexuality. The body language expressed by Chinese models demonstrate subordination, defined by the covering of faces and the tilting of heads. On the contrary, Chinese advertisements depict white women as powerful and uninhibited. They stare straight into the camera, do not cover their mouths while laughing, and hold their heads high.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to [[Rey Chow]], cultural critic and professor at [[Duke University]], the fetishism of white women in Chinese media does not have to do with sex; instead Chow describes it as a type of commodity fetishism. White women are seen as a representation of what China does not have: an image of a woman as something more than the heterosexual opposite to man.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Third World Women and the Politics of Feminism|last=Chow|first=Rey|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1991|isbn=978-0-253-20632-9|editor-last=Mohanty|editor-first=Chandra Talpade|location=|pages=86|editor-last2=Russo|editor-first2=Ann|editor-last3=Torres|editor-first3=Lourdes}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the contrary, Perry Johansson, author of the ''Postcolonial Studies Journal'' article, "Consuming the other: The fetish of the western woman in Chinese advertising and popular culture," argues that the racial fetish of white women in Chinese culture does have something to do with sex. White women represent a shift in the power dynamics between women and men. As a result, white women are a source of fear.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Asian women ===
According to an article from the ''Washington and Lee Journal of Civil Rights and Social Justice'', the "Asian fetish" syndrome is born out of the male desire for dominance and the stereotype of Asian women as individuals open to domination.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Woan|first=Sunny|date=|title=White Sexual Imperialism: A Theory of Asian Feminist Jurisprudence|url=http://scholarlycommons.law.wlu.edu/crsj/vol14/iss2/5/|journal=Washington and Lee Journal of Civil Rights and Social Justice|volume=14|issue=2|issn=1535-0843}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, following the 1970s and a peak in the American feminist movement, many white men turned to [[mail-order bride]] companies in search of a loyal, understanding, and subservient partner. They saw women of their own race as too career-oriented and strong-willed. Asian women were the antithesis to their perception of white women.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; While white women resisted powerlessness and subjugation to the white man, Asian women were seen as open to the subjugation, even depicted as enjoying it.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The song "Yellow Fever" by [[The Bloodhound Gang]] includes lyrics such as, "She's an oriental rug cause I lay her where I please," and "Then I blindfold her with dental floss and get down on her knees."&lt;ref&gt;''Yellow Fever''. Bloodhound Gang. 1996. Song.&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these instances exemplify the stereotype of Asians as submissive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Okumura|first=Ritsuko|date=|title=Yellow Fever|url=|journal=The Asian/Pacific American Women's Journal|volume=10|pages=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Margaret Cho has labeled [[Gwen Stefani]]'s [[Harajuku Girls]] as a "minstrel show" because they represent [[Stereotypes of East Asians in the United States|fetishized East Asian stereotypes]].&lt;ref name="Cho"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://margaretcho.com/2005/10/31/harajuku-girls/|title=Harajuku Girls|last=Cho|first=Margaret|authorlink=Margaret Cho|website=Margaretcho.com|accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The girls follow Stefani around on tour and are contractually obligated not to speak English in public.&lt;ref name="Ahn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2005/04/09/geisha_2/|title=Gwenihana|last=Ahn|first=Mihi|work=Salon|accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The performer had "renamed" them corresponding to her album title and clothing brand, L.A.M.B.: Love, Angel, Music, and Baby.&lt;ref name="Ahn" /&gt;

Furthermore, there have been many cases of Asian fetishism leading to criminal activity. In one case in 2000, two men, David Dailey and Edmund Ball, abducted and blindfolded two Japanese girls in Washington, one who was eighteen and the other who was nineteen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/dec/31/local/me-6906|title=Abduction and Rape of 2 Japanese Students Outrages Spokane|last=GERANIOS|first=NICHOLAS K.|date=2000-12-31|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-04-22|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ball specifically targeted these Asian students because he thought that they were submissive and were less likely to report sexual abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20010531&amp;slug=mukogawa31m|title=Local News {{!}} Rapists bet on victims' silence - and lose {{!}} Seattle Times Newspaper|website=community.seattletimes.nwsource.com|access-date=2017-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another case, in 2005, Michael Lohman, a doctoral student at Princeton University, was charged by the state of New Jersey for reckless endangerment, theft, harassment as well as tampering with a food product. Michael had cut locks of hair off at least nine Asian women. He also poured his semen and urine into the drinks of Asian Princeton students more than fifty times. In his apartment, Michael also had mittens filled with hairs of Asian women.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2005/04/14/for-asian-women-fetish-is-less-than-benign/|title=For Asian women, 'fetish' is less than benign|access-date=2017-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Black women and men ===
After the Civil War, black men were more commonly falsely accused for the rape of white women compared to white men. Sexual relationships between black men and white women were frowned upon.&lt;ref&gt;Hodes, Martha.&amp;nbsp;''White women, black men''. Yale University Press, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1986, [[Robert Mapplethorpe]] had a photographic art show titled Black Males, showing photographs of naked black men exclusively. This work has been highly criticized for fetishizing the black male body, notably by [[Kobena Mercer]] in his aforementioned essay. Though it was not necessarily the artist's intention to portray these men as fetishized objects, they have been perceived that way by many audiences, especially in relation to some of his other works concerning gay male [[BDSM]] practices. The latter works examine an actual subculture of sexuality that is enacted by the photographic subjects: the men in the photos are wearing/using their own gear and clothing, putting their fetish(es) on display.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, in Mapplethorpe's photos of black men, the subjects are not doing anything but existing as nude bodies, they are hyper-sexualized by the camera, therefore they become the fetish objects.&lt;ref name=Mercer/&gt;

The fetishization of black women expanded during the [[Colonial Era]], as some white male slave owners raped their black, female slaves. They justified their actions by labeling the women as hyper-sexual property. These labels solidified into what is commonly referred to as the "[[Jezebel]]" stereotype.&lt;ref&gt;Carolyn M West. "Mammy, Jezebel, Sapphire and their homegirls: Developing an "oppositional gaze" toward the images of Black women" 4thNew York''Lectures on the psychology of women''&amp;nbsp;(2008) p. 286 - 299&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charmaine Nelson]] discusses the way black females are presented in paintings, with an emphasis on nude paintings. Nelson argues that every nude painting feeds into the voyeuristic male gaze, but the way black women are painted has even more undertones." The black female body defies the white male subject's desire for a single subject of 'pure' origin in two ways: firstly, through a sexual 'otherness' as woman, and secondly through a racial and colour 'otherness' as black. It is the combined power of these two markers of social location which has enabled western artists to represent black women at the margins of societal boundaries of propriety." The black woman is considered a fetish in these paintings and she is only viewed in a sexual lens.&lt;ref name=Mercer/&gt;

One of the more recent popular discourses around the fetishization of black women surrounds the release of [[Nicki Minaj]]'s popular song, "[[Anaconda (Nicki Minaj song)|Anaconda]]" in 2014. The entire song and music video revolves around the largeness of black women's bottoms. While some praise Minaj's work for its embrace of female sexuality, many{{Clarify|reason="many" is vague. What was the sample set for "many"? The general population? Fans? Philosophers?|date=July 2018}} believe that this song continues to reduce black women to be the focus of the male gaze.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/womens-blog/2014/aug/22/nicki-minaj-anaconda-video-black-women-sexuality|title=Shocked and outraged by Nicki Minaj's Anaconda video?

=== Mestizo Latinos and Latinas ===
Mestizo Latina women face racial fetishism much more than their male counterparts. They are seen as something that is tropical. Through media they are portrayed to always be in bright colors, having long brown hair, red lips, curvaceous figure, and revealing clothing. Unlike Latino/Chicano men, Latina/Chicana women have hypersexualized bodies. &amp;nbsp;A perfect example of how Latina women are depicted is [[Jennifer Lopez]]. When she is on a magazine cover or in a photo shoot, her butt is what is emphasized in the picture. Her butt is seemingly abnormal, because it exceeds the standards for a "normal" white butt. This hyper-buttocks places Jennifer Lopez in the category of the other. It is interesting though, because the fact that Latina/Chicanas are in the category of the other, it makes them more desirable. They are perceived as an exotic race that is hypersexual. This tradition excludes Latina/Chicanas from being a part of the norm and they are forever to be viewed as foreigners and a threat to "true" American culture.&lt;ref&gt;Guzmán, Isabel Molina, and Angharad N. Valdivia "Brain, brow, and booty: Latina iconicity in US popular culture."&amp;nbsp;''The communication review''&amp;nbsp;7.2 (2004): 205-221.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to work of George Gerbner, through extended exposure to the very consistent and persistent ideas expressed on television, people tend to view what is being broadcast as a reality with no regard for it veracity. Supposedly the more television someone watches, the more likely they are to see the world in the same lens as the televised world. This means that any ideals in regards to certain races, can influence the way people perceive said races. The way that Latino/a men and women have been portrayed in the media has created a racial fetish on their bodies and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pages=347–365|doi=10.1080/15213260701286106|title=The Cultivation of Social Perceptions of Latinos: A Mental Models Approach|journal=Media Psychology|volume=9|issue=2|year=2007|last1=Mastro|first1=Dana|last2=Behm-Morawitz|first2=Elizabeth|last3=Ortiz|first3=Michelle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Founded in 1980 on [[Hilton Head Island, South Carolina]] by Linda LeSourd Lader and her husband [[Philip Lader]],&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/31/us/bill-hillary-and-other-plain-folks-are-all-set-for-one-heady-weekend.html|title=Bill, Hillary and Other Plain Folks Are All Set for One Heady Weekend|last=Jehl|first=Douglas|date=1993-12-31|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; the former U.S. Ambassador to the [[Court of St. James's]], Renaissance Weekends, now held in several locations each year, are structured to encourage the transcendence of political, economic, and religious differences by bringing together distinguished participants from a wide range of fields, including CEOs, venture capitalists and entrepreneurs, Nobel Laureates and Pulitzer Prize-winners, artists and scientists, astronauts and Olympians, judges, diplomats and Presidents, Prime Ministers, professors and priests, Republicans, Democrats and Independents.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.postandcourier.com/article/20151228/PC1603/151229472/1031/renaissance-weekend-returns-to-charleston|title=Renaissance Weekend returns to Charleston|date=2015-12-28|website=Post and Courier|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Weekends are geared towards the establishment of an environment free of partisanship and commercialism, where "civility prevails." Membership is by invitation only.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Sixty families pioneered the Lader's 1980 [[New Year]]'s [[house party]]. The result has been a cross-generational "continuing conversation" of individuals with broadly divergent perspectives, no [[political agenda]], but a legacy of ideas and friendships.

Through hundreds of panels, seminars and workshops each Weekend, participants themselves address such public policy and personal concerns as "America's Responsibility to the World," "Investment Perspectives," "How the Media has Covered the War Against Terrorism," "[[Corporate Governance]] After [[Enron]]," "Beating Cancer," "My Family's Legacies for Life," and "[[Christianity]], [[Judaism]] &amp; [[Islam]] - Eternal Truths &amp; Current Myths."

== Attendees ==

{{Wiktionary}}
'''Ribaldry''', or '''blue comedy''', is [[humor]]ous [[entertainment]] that ranges from bordering on indelicacy to gross [[morality|indecency]]. It is also referred to as "bawdiness", "gaminess" or "bawdy".

Sex is presented in ribald material more for the purpose of poking fun at the foibles and weaknesses that manifest themselves in [[human sexuality]], rather than to present sexual stimulation either excitingly or artistically. Also, ribaldry may use sex as a [[metaphor]] to illustrate some non-sexual concern, in which case ribaldry may verge on the territory of [[satire]].

Like any humour, ribaldry may be read as conventional or [[subversive]]. Ribaldry typically depends on a shared background of sexual conventions and values, and its [[comedy]] generally depends on seeing those conventions broken.

The ritual taboo-breaking that is a usual counterpart of ribaldry underlies its controversial nature and explains why ribaldry is sometimes a subject of [[censorship]]. Ribaldry, whose usual aim is ''not'' "merely" to be sexually stimulating, often does address larger concerns than mere sexual appetite. However, being presented in the form of comedy, these larger concerns may be overlooked by censors.

Ribaldry differs from [[black comedy]] (or gallows humor) in that black comedy deals with topics which would normally considered painful or frightening whereas ribaldry deals with topics that would only be considered offensive.

==Examples==
Ribaldry is present to some degree in every culture and has likely been around for all of human history. Works like ''[[Lysistrata]]'' by [[Aristophanes]], ''[[Menaechmi]]'' by [[Plautus]], ''[[Satyricon|Cena Trimalchionis]]'' by [[Petronius]], and ''[[The Golden Ass]]'' of [[Apuleius]] are ribald classics from [[Classical Antiquity|ancient Greece and Rome]]. [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s "[[The Miller's Prologue and Tale|The Miller's Tale]]" from his ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'' and ''[[The Crabfish]]'', one of the oldest English traditional ballads, are classic examples. The Frenchman [[François Rabelais]] showed himself to be a master of ribaldry (technically called [[grotesque body]]) in his ''[[Gargantua]]'' and other works. ''[[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman]]'' by [[Laurence Sterne]] and ''[[The Lady's Dressing Room]]'' by [[Jonathan Swift]] are also in this genre; as is [[Mark Twain]]'s long-suppressed ''[[1601 (Mark Twain)|1601]]''.

Another example of ribaldry is "[[De Brevitate Vitae]]", a song which in many [[Europe]]an-influenced universities is both a student beer-drinking song and an anthem sung by official university [[choir]]s at public graduation ceremonies. The private and public versions of the song contain vastly different words. More recent works like ''[[Candy (Southern and Hoffenberg novel)|Candy]]'', ''[[Barbarella (film)|Barbarella]]'', ''[[L'Infermiera]]'', the comedic works of [[Russ Meyer]], ''[[Little Annie Fanny]]'' and [[John Barth]]'s ''[[The Sot-Weed Factor]]'' are probably better classified as ribaldry than as either pornography or erotica.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==Bawdy song==&lt;!--[[Bawdy song]] redirects directly here--&gt;
A '''bawdy song''' is a humorous song that emphasises sexual themes and is often rich with [[innuendo]]. Historically these songs tend to be confined to groups of young males, either as students or in an environment where alcohol is flowing freely. An early collection was ''[[Wit and Mirth, or Pills to Purge Melancholy]]'', edited by Thomas D'Urfey and published between 1698 and 1720. Selected songs from ''Wit and Mirth'' have been recorded by the [[City Waites]] and other singers. Sailor's songs tend to be quite frank about the exploitative nature of the relationship between men and women. There are many examples of folk songs in which a man encounters a woman in the countryside. This is followed by a short conversation, and then sexual  intercourse, e.g. "The Game of All Fours". Neither side demonstrates any shame or regret. If the woman becomes pregnant, the man will not be there anyway. [[Rugby football|Rugby]] songs are often bawdy. Examples of bawdy folk songs are: "[[Seventeen Come Sunday]]" and "[[The Ballad of Eskimo Nell]]". [[Robert Burns]] compiled ''The Merry Muses of Caledonia'' (the title is not Burns's), a collection of bawdy lyrics that were popular in the music halls of Scotland as late as the 20th century. In modern times [[Hash House Harriers]] have taken on the role of tradition-bearers for this kind of song. ''The Unexpurgated Folk Songs of Men'' (Arhoolie 4006) is a gramophone record containing a collection of American bawdy songs recorded in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Sandberg, L. &amp; Weissman, D. (1976) ''The Folk Music Sourcebook''. New York: Knopf; p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blue comedy==
Blue comedy is comedy that is [[off-color]], [[wiktionary:risqué|risqué]], [[morality|indecent]] or [[profanity|profane]], largely about sex. It often contains [[profanity]] or sexual imagery that may shock and offend some audience members.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

"Working blue" refers to the act of using curse words and discussing things that people do not discuss in "polite society". A "blue comedian" or "blue comic" is a [[comedian]] who usually performs risqué routines layered with curse words. 

There is a common belief that comedian [[Max Miller (comedian)|Max Miller]] (1894–1963) coined the phrase, after his stage act which involved telling jokes from either a white book or a blue book, chosen by audience preference (the blue book contained ribald jokes). This is not so, as the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' contains earlier references to the use of blue to mean ribald: 1890 ''Sporting Times'' 25 Jan. 1/1 "''Shifter wondered whether the damsel knew any novel blue stories.''" and 1900 ''Bulletin'' (Sydney) 20 Oct. 12/4 "''Let someone propose to celebrate [[Geoffery Chaucer|Chaucer]] by publicly reading some of his bluest productions unexpurgated. The reader would probably be locked up.''"

Private events at show business clubs such as the Bob Saget Club and The Masquers often showed this blue side of otherwise cleancut Bob Saget; a recording survives of one Masquers roast from the 1950s with [[Jack Benny]], [[George Jessel (actor)|George Jessel]], [[George Burns]], and [[Art Linkletter]] all using highly risqué material and obscenities. Many comedians who are normally family-friendly might choose to work blue when off-camera or in an adult-oriented environment; [[Bob Saget]] exemplifies this [[dichotomy]]. [[Bill Cosby]]'s 1969 record album [[8:15 12:15]] records both his family-friendly evening standup comedy show, and his blue midnight show, which included a joke about impregnating his wife "right through the old midnight trampoline" (her [[Diaphragm (birth control)|diaphragm]]) and other sexual references.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/r234485 |title=Bill Cosby: 8:15 12:15 - Bill Cosby &amp;#124; AllMusic |first=Sean |last=Carruthers |work=allmusic.com |year=2011 |accessdate=29 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some comedians build their careers on blue comedy. Among the best known of these are [[Redd Foxx]], [[Lawanda Page]], and the team of Leroy and Skillet, all of whom later performed on the family-friendly television show [[Sanford and Son]]. Page, Leroy, and Skillet specialized in a particular [[African American]] form of blue spoken word recitation called [[Signifyin'|signifying or toasting]]. [[Dave Attell]] has also been described by his peers as one of the greatest modern-day blue comics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=MMPC|title=Bill Burr - Christopher Cross / Go See Dave Attell|date=2016-03-04|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTih1ZnwVs8|accessdate=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On [[talk radio]] in the United States, many commentators use blue comedy in their political programs. Examples include [[Neal Boortz]], Eric Von Haessler, [[Phil Hendrie]] and [[Preston and Steve|Steve Morrison]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

'''Science outreach''', also called '''Education and Public Outreach''' ('''EPO''' or '''E/PO''') or simply '''public outreach''',{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} is an [[umbrella term]] for a variety of activities by [[research institute]]s, [[University|universities]], and institutions such as [[science museum]]s, aimed at promoting [[Public awareness of science|public awareness (and understanding) of science]] and making informal contributions to [[science education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Varner, Johanna|title=Scientific outreach: toward effective public engagement with biological science|journal=BioScience|volume=64|issue=4|year=2014|pages=333–340|doi=10.1093/biosci/biu021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope and history==

While there have always been individual scientists interested in educating the public, science outreach has recently become more organized. For example, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ([[NASA]]) now requires all of its projects to organize suitable outreach activities.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Also working to inform the public are organizations such as Communicating Astronomy to the Public&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.communicatingastronomy.org/meetings/ Communicating Astronomy to the Public]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Washington Declaration on Communicating Astronomy to the Public&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrao.edu/ccap/conf_wash.shtml Washington Declaration on Communicating Astronomy to the Public]&lt;/ref&gt; that organize conferences for the public on science issues and make efforts to put outreach on a more general institutional footing.

Recently, an increasing number of projects have hired designated outreach scientists (part-time or full-time) that handle public relations for their project. There are also specialized outreach providers such as the Education branch of the [[Space Science Institute]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacescience.org/education/index.html Education branch of the Space Science Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; in Boulder, Colorado and the [[NASA Education and Public Outreach Group at Sonoma State University|Education and Public Outreach Group]] at [[Sonoma State University]] which offer to organize a project's outreach activities on a contractual basis.

In addition to outreach by research institutions, an important part of informal science education are outreach programs such as [[science museum]]s and [[science festival]]s.

==Examples of science outreach activities==

Science outreach can take on a variety of forms.

===Public talks/lectures/discussions===
[[File:Universum für Alle - New book showcases ESO images.jpg|thumb|Universum für Alle: 70 short popular lectures at [[Heidelberg University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Book Showcases ESO Images|url=http://www.eso.org/public/announcements/ann12091/|accessdate=3 December 2012|newspaper=ESO Announcements}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

Lectures are probably the oldest form of science outreach, dating back to the 1820s when [[Michael Faraday]] organized the first of the [[Royal Institution|Royal Institution's]] [[Royal Institution Christmas Lectures|Christmas Lectures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The RI Christmas Lectures (Royal Institution Website)| url=http://www.rigb.org/rimain/events/christmaslectures.jsp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public talks can be part of a lecture series, given at a [[science festival]] or in cooperation with a special interest group such as a local [[astronomy club]]. Public presentations can have a variety of formats, including straightforward lecture formats with or without [[Scientific demonstration|experimental demonstrations]], guided live interviews, and discussions with several participants and a moderator. There are also less formal initiatives such as [[Café Scientifique]], in which a café or bar is the venue for regular meetings involving guest scientists that come to talk about their work or take part in discussions with members of the public.

===Visiting primary and secondary schools===

School students and teachers are an important target group for science outreach. Outreach activities can include scientists visiting schools, giving talks at assemblies, discussions with students, or participation in events such as [[career fair]]s and science and technology camps.  One organization that focuses on this kind of science outreach is [[Robogals]]. Many universities also have science outreach programs that are dedicated to building relationships between high school students, university scientists, and K-12 teachers. A few of the most prominent university science outreach programs include Carolina Science Outreach,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Carolina Science Outreach | url=http://www.csousc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Vanderbilt Student Volunteers for Science,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Vanderbilt Student Volunteers for Science | url=http://studentorgs.vanderbilt.edu/vsvs/}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Rockefeller University Science Outreach Program,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Rockefeller University Science Outreach Program | url=http://www.rockefeller.edu/outreach/}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Present Your Ph.D. Thesis to a 12-Year Old Outreach Project at University of Texas in Austin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Science Educational Outreach Programs That Benefit Students and Scientists | url=http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002368}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Stanford University Office of Science Outreach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Stanford University Office of Science Outreach| url=http://oso.stanford.edu/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using Canada as an example, it has been estimated that with sufficient organization, every classroom from kindergarten through graduation could in practice receive a visit from one or more scientists annually with participation from only 10-15% of the scientific enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;Bechara J. Saab, [http://www.hypothesisjournal.com/?p=902 "Engaging the Clutch of the Science Communication Continuum – Shifting Science Outreach into High Gear"], ''Hypothesis'' Volume 8 Issue 1 (September 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of science outreach programs in Canada include: [[Let's Talk Science]], [[Actua (Canadian charity)|Actua]], [[Chemical Institute of Canada|The Chemical Institute of Canada]], and [[Science Rendezvous]]. 

===Workshops/schools for teachers and/or students===
[[File:Cover of the ALMA radioastronomy manual.jpg|thumb|Cover of the [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array|ALMA]] [[radioastronomy]] manual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ALMA Material for Teachers|url=http://www.eso.org/public/announcements/ann15052/|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Inviting groups of school students to a research institution for a workshop is another popular form of outreach.  Formats range from a one-day visit to more involved week-long events such as [[Perimeter Institute]]'s International Summer School for Young Physicists, a two-week-long programs for a total of a hundred Canadian and international students from grade 11.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/Outreach/Education/ISSYP_Overview International Summer School for Young Physicists]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another method of science outreach invites school teachers to participate in workshops where they are able to learn effective strategies to engage students in science. This approach was especially embraced by the [[Canadian Space Agency]] which held an annual "Space Educators" conference up until 2012 to provides teachers with access to resources to educate their students in space-related science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Canadian Space Agency Educators Resources | url=http://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/educators/default.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supporting science fairs and similar events===
[[File:Cloud chamber as science for general public.jpg|thumb|One of the major goals of [[science festival]]s is to make [[science]] more accessible to [[general public]]. [[Cloud chamber]]s are popular at [[science fair]]s for their ability to visualize otherwise [[invisible]] [[radiation]] that surrounds us.]]
Besides organizing independent events, many outreach organizations sponsor existing events that promote sciences awareness. A notable examples are [[science fair]]s, [[public science]] events in which working scientists can participate both as judges and as sponsors of student projects.

=== Online aggregation of science activities, resources, and programs ===
The internet is a rich source of science activities, resources, and programs. For example, research laboratories often maintain educational outreach projects aimed at translating their science into something meaningful for the general public, often [[K–12|K-12]] students, as an effort to increase research broader impacts required by funding agencies such as the NSF.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/od/oia/special/broaderimpacts/|title=Broader Impacts - National Science Foundation|website=www.nsf.gov|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; These may include activities using fast-growing plants that exhibit distinctive mutants with unique [[phenotype]]s useful to teach K-12 students about both Mendelian and molecular genetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fpsc.wisc.edu/program/index.shtm|title=FPsc: genetics, evolution, modern genetic sciences|website=fpsc.wisc.edu|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some institutions and organizations maintain large&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://science.wisc.edu/|title=Home {{!}} science.wisc.edu {{!}} University of Wisconsin–Madison|website=science.wisc.edu|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; or small&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sanfordlab.org/education/updates|title=Education and Outreach {{!}} Sanford Underground Research Facility|website=www.sanfordlab.org|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; aggregations of their activity resources,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sanfordlab.org/education/curriculum-modules|title=Curriculum Modules {{!}} Sanford Underground Research Facility|website=www.sanfordlab.org|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; outreach programs,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://science.wisc.edu/outreachprograms.htm|title=Outreach Programs {{!}} science.wisc.edu {{!}} University of Wisconsin–Madison|website=science.wisc.edu|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; upcoming events calendars,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://today.wisc.edu/events/feed/2/|title=Science / UW-Madison Events Calendar|website=today.wisc.edu|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and partnering programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://science.wisc.edu/sciencealliance.htm|title=Science Alliance {{!}} science.wisc.edu {{!}} University of Wisconsin–Madison|website=science.wisc.edu|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==

A number of awards honor commitment to science outreach.  Examples include:
* Award for Public Understanding of Science and Technology, [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaas.org/aboutaaas/awards/public/index.shtml Award for Public Understanding of Science and Technology], American Association for the Advancement of Science&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''September 11 National Day of Service and Remembrance''' or '''9/11 Day''' is a federally-recognized day of unity and charitable service, annually observed throughout the United States and in other countries around the world on the anniversary of the [[September 11 terrorist attacks]]. It has grown to become the largest annual day of charitable service in the United States.

==Background==

According to the nonprofit MyGoodDeed, which founded the September 11 National Day of Service and Remembrance ("9/11 Day") in 2002, the goal of "9/11 Day" is "to keep alive the spirit of unity and compassion that arose in the immediate aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]] in tribute to the individuals lost and injured in the attacks, and the many who rose in service in response." The idea of making September 11 an annual day of service was first conceived in the winter of 2001 by David Paine, a former marketing executive from New York City. In the Spring of 2002 David was joined by his friend Jay Winuk, who had lost his brother Glenn Winuk in the attacks at the World Trade Center, and together they formed the nonprofit group called One Day's Pay. In 2007, the name of the organization was officially changed to MyGoodDeed. In 2009, MyGoodDeed successfully led an effort to designate September 11 under federal law as a National Day of Service and Remembrance, which occurred as part of passage of the bipartisan Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act by the [[United States Congress]], and later, by an amendment to the Patriot Day [[Presidential Proclamation]] by President Barack Obama, which formally recognized and established September 11 as a National Day of Service and Remembrance. The Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act authorized the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS), a federal agency, to assist the 9/11 community in building awareness of and support for "9/11 Day" through its national service programs. In 2011, on the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks, MyGoodDeed, CNCS and the Points of Light Institute/HandsOn Network joined together to organize the largest day of charitable service in U.S. history, with more than 32 million Americans participating, according to research conducted by Horizon Consumer Science on behalf of MyGoodDeed. Today, 9/11 Day continues to engage nearly 30 million Americans annually in various forms of charitable service, including volunteering, donations to charities, and simple good deeds.&lt;ref&gt;[https://911day.org/about/ About Us], 911day.org, published by MyGoodDeed, accessed July 20, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.serve.gov/?q=site-page/september-11th-national-day-service-and-remembrance|September 11th National Day of Service and Remembrance], serve.gov, published by the Corporation for National and Community Service, accessed July 20, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pointsoflight.org/signature-events/911-day-service-and-remembrance/2011|9/11 Day of Service and Remembrance 2011], pointsoflight.org, published by the Points of Light Foundation, accessed July 20, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

Activities by volunteers on this federally-recognized National Day of Service and Remembrance happen all across the nation, and include lesson plans that engage tens of thousands of students of all ages in service activities; coast-to-coast blood drives; meal packing projects; painting and refurbishing homes; food drives; reclaiming neighborhoods; helping communities prepare for disasters; and countless other activities that support and honor those lost and injured on 9/11; veterans, soldiers, military families, and rescue and recovery workers, including first responders. Among the largest projects held annually are two large-scale hunger relief projects, one in New York City and another at the National Mall in Washington, DC, which mobilize a total of more than 7,000 volunteers who together pack over two million meals for individuals at risk of hunger. In Boston, thousands join together on 9/11 at the Rose Kennedy Greenway to assemble care packages for military personnel.  Participants are encouraged to use the [[hashtag]] #911Day when posting online about the day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.serve.gov/?q=site-page/september-11th-national-day-service-and-remembrance|September 11th National Day of Service and Remembrance], serve.gov, published by the Corporation for National and Community Service, accessed July 20, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ysa.org/act/programs/911day/ 9/11 Day of Service &amp; Remembrance], ysa.org, published by Youth Service America, accessed July 20, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Volunteers Honor 9/11 Victims By Helping Others On National Day Of Service|url=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/09/11/volunteers-honor-911-victims-by-helping-others-on-national-day-of-service/|accessdate=2 December 2012|newspaper=CBS New York|date=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''sign''' is an [[Physical body|object]], [[quality (philosophy)|quality]], event, or [[entity]] whose presence or occurrence indicates the probable presence or occurrence of something else.&lt;ref&gt;New Oxford American Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; A natural sign bears a causal relation to its object—for instance, [[thunder]] is a sign of storm, or medical [[symptom]]s signify a disease. A conventional sign signifies by agreement, as a [[full stop]] signifies the end of a sentence; similarly the words and expressions of a [[language]], as well as bodily [[gesture]]s, can be regarded as signs, expressing particular [[Meaning (linguistics)|meanings]]. The physical objects most commonly referred to as signs (notices, [[road sign]]s, etc., collectively known as [[signage]]) generally inform or instruct using [[written text]], [[symbol]]s, [[picture]]s or a combination of these.

The philosophical study of signs and [[symbol]]s is called [[semiotics]]; this includes the study of [[semiosis]], which is the way in which [[sign (semiotics)|signs (in the semiotic sense)]] operate.

==Nature==
{{unreferenced|section|date=August 2018}}
[[Semiotics]], [[epistemology]], logic, and [[philosophy of language]] are concerned about the nature of signs, what they are and how they signify.  The nature of signs and symbols and significations, their definition, elements, and types, is mainly established by [[Aristotle]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], and [[Aquinas]]. According to these classic sources, significance is a relationship between two sorts of things: signs and the kinds of things they signify (intend, express or mean), where one term necessarily causes something else to come to the mind. Distinguishing natural signs and conventional signs, the traditional theory of signs ([[Augustine]]) sets the following threefold partition of things:
all sorts of indications, evidences, symptoms, and physical signals, there are signs which are ''always'' signs (the entities of the mind as ideas and images, thoughts and feelings, constructs and intentions); and there are signs that ''have'' to get their signification (as linguistic entities and cultural symbols). So, while natural signs serve as the source of signification, the human mind is the agency through which signs signify naturally occurring things, such as objects, states, qualities, quantities, events, processes, or relationships. Human [[language]] and [[discourse]], [[communication]], [[philosophy]], [[science]], [[logic]], [[mathematics]], [[poetry]], [[theology]], and [[religion]] are only some of fields of human study and activity where grasping the nature of signs and symbols and patterns of signification may have a decisive value. Communication takes place without words but via the mind as a result of signs and symbols; They communicate/pass across/ messages to the human mind through their pictorial representation.

* [[Gang signal]]
* Sign, in [[Tracking (hunting)]]: also known as [[Spoor (animal)]]; trace evidence left on the ground after passage.
* A [[signboard]].
* A sign, in common use, is an [[wikt:indication|indication]] that a previously observed event is about to occur again
* Sign, in [[divination]] and religion: an [[omen]], an event or occurrence believed to foretell the future
* Sign, in [[ontology]] and [[spirituality]]: a [[coincidence]] or surprising event thought to reveal divine will; see [[synchronicity]]
* [[Sign (linguistics)]]: a combination of a concept and a sound-image described by Ferdinand de Saussure
* In [[mathematics]], the [[sign (mathematics)|sign of a number]] tells whether it is [[positive and negative numbers|positive or negative]]. Also, the [[sign of a permutation]] tells whether it is the product of an [[parity (mathematics)|even or odd]] number of [[transposition (mathematics)|transpositions]].
* [[Signedness]], in computing, is the property that a representation of a number has one [[bit]], the sign bit, which denotes whether the number is non-negative or negative.  A number is called signed if it contains a sign bit, otherwise unsigned. See also [[signed number representation]]
* Sign, in [[biology]]: an indication of some living thing's presence
* [[Medical sign]], in [[medicine]]: objective evidence of the presence of a disease or disorder, as opposed to a [[symptom]], which is subjective
* [[Sign (semiotics)]]: the basic unit of meaning
* [[Information sign]]: a notice that instructs, advises, informs or warns [[people]]
* [[Traffic sign]]: a sign that instructs drivers; see also [[stop sign]], [[speed limit]] sign, [[cross walk]] sign
* Sign, in a [[writing system]]: a basic unit. Similar terms which are more specific are character, letter or [[grapheme]]
* [[Commercial signage]], including [[flashing sign]]s, such as on a retail store, factory, or theatre
* [[Signature]], in history: a handwritten depiction observed on a document to show authorship and will
* For marketing or advocacy purposes, a [[signage]] refers to the collective use of signs to convey a message.

== Christianity ==

===St. Augustine and signs===
[[St. Augustine]] was the first man who synthesized the classical and Hellenistic theories of signs. For him a sign is a thing which is used to signify other things and to make them come to mind (''[[De Doctrina Christiana]]'' (hereafter DDC) 1.2.2; 2.1.1). The most common signs are spoken and written words (DDC 1.2.2; 2.3.4-2.4.5). Although God cannot be fully expressible, Augustine gave emphasis to the possibility of God’s communication with humans by signs in Scripture (DDC 1.6.6).  Augustine endorsed and developed the classical and Hellenistic theories of signs.  Among the mainstream in the theories of signs, i.e., that of Aristotle and that of Stoics, the former theory filtered into the works of Cicero (106-43 BC, ''De inventione rhetorica'' 1.30.47-48) and Quintilian (circa 35-100, ''Institutio Oratoria'' 5.9.9-10), which regarded the sign as an instrument of inference.  In his commentary on Aristotle’s ''De Interpretatione'', Ammonius said, "according to the division of the philosopher Theophrastus, the relation of speech is twofold, first in regard to the audience, to which speech signifies something, and secondly in regard to the things about which the speaker intends to persuade the audience." If we match DDC with this division, the first part belongs to DDC Book IV and the second part to DDC Books I-III. Augustine, although influenced by these theories, advanced his own theological theory of signs, with whose help one can infer the mind of God from the events and words of Scripture.

Books II and III of DDC enumerate all kinds of signs and explain how to interpret them. Signs are divided into natural (''naturalia'') and conventional (''data''); the latter is divided into animal (''bestiae'') and human (''homines''); the latter is divided into non-words (''cetera'') and words (''verba''); the latter is divided into spoken words (''voces'') and written words (''litterae''); the latter is divided into unknown signs (''signa ignota'') and ambiguous signs (''signa ambigua''); both the former and the latter are divided respectively into particular signs (''signa propria'') and figurative signs (''signa translata''), among which the unknown figurative signs belong to the pagans.
In addition to exegetical knowledge (Quintilian, ''Institutio Oratoria'' 1.4.1-3 and 1.8.1-21) which follows the order of reading (''lectio''), textual criticism (''emendatio''), explanation (''enarratio''), and judgment (''iudicium''),  one needs to know the original language (Hebrew and Greek) and broad background information on Scripture (DDC 2.9.14-2.40.60).

Augustine’s understanding of signs includes several hermeneutical presuppositions as important factors. First, the interpreter should proceed with humility, because only a humble person can grasp the truth of Scripture (DDC 2.41.62). Second, the interpreter must have a spirit of active inquiry and should not hesitate to learn and use pagan education for the purpose of leading to Christian learning,  because all truth is God’s truth (DDC 2.40.60-2.42.63). Third, the heart of interpreter should be founded, rooted, and built up in love which is the final goal of the entire Scriptures (DDC 2.42.63).

The sign does not function as its own goal, but its purpose lies in its role as a signification (''res significans'', DDC 3.9.13). God gave signs as a means to reveal himself; Christians need to exercise hermeneutical principles in order to understand that divine revelation. Even if the Scriptural text is obscure, it has meaningful benefits. For the obscure text prevents us from falling into pride, triggers our intelligence (DDC 2.6.7), tempers our faith in the history of revelation (DDC 3.8.12), and refines our mind to be suitable to the holy mysteries (DDC 4.8.22). When interpreting signs, the literal meaning should first be sought, and then the figurative meaning (DDC 3.10.14-3.23.33). Augustine suggests the hermeneutical principle that the obscure Scriptural verse is interpreted with the help of plain and simple verses, which formed the doctrine of "scriptura scripturae interpres" (Scripture is the Interpreter of Scripture) in the Reformation Era. Moreover, he introduces the seven rules of Tyconius the Donatist to interpret the obscure meaning of the Bible, which demonstrates his understanding that all truth belongs to God (DDC 3.3.42-3.37.56). In order to apply Augustine's hermeneutics of the sign appropriately in modern times, every division of theology must be involved and interdisciplinary approaches must be taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Woo | first=B.

The '''social impact of thong underwear''' has been covered extensively in the media, ranging from a ban on wearing [[thong (clothing)|thong]]s to thongs for the underaged. The rise of thong usage has been asserted by Christian minister Oneil McQuick to be linked to a rise of [[sexualization]] in society,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Oneil|last=McQuick|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ewm93pO7YQcC&amp;pg=PT1&amp;dq=thong+society+sex|title=The Sexuality Series|page=29|publisher=L.I.M Publishing|year=2007|isbn=1-4196-4225-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Christian writer Philo Thelos to be linked to a rise in a desire to go unclothed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Philo|last=Thelos|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KpYJYeKiss8C&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=thong+society+sex|title=Divine Sex: Liberating Sex from Religious Tradition|page=52|publisher=Trafford Publishing|year=2003|isbn=1-55395-400-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
[[File:Thong (cropped).jpg|thumb|Woman wearing a T-back thong in [[Sunrise, Florida]], USA in 2006]] 

When discussing the trend of wearing thongs, Christian writer Sharon Daugherty comments in her book ''What Guys See That Girls Don't: Or Do They?'' that the fashion industry "may have changed the mindset of our society",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Sharon|last=Daugherty|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g3kx5Z42GPYC||title=What Guys See That Girls Don't: Or Do They?|page=61|publisher=Destiny Image Publishers|year=2006|isbn=0-7684-2368-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was followed by the observation that "the whole idea of wearing so that no panty line or bumps can show isn't substantiated" and that "the thong was created by fashion designers to arouse sexual thoughts".{{sfn|Daugherty|2006|page=63}}

[[Monica Lewinsky]] gave evidence during the [[Lewinsky scandal]] that she was flirting with [[Bill Clinton]] in [[Leon Panetta]]'s office, and that she lifted her jacket to show him the straps of her thong underwear above her pants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Starr | first = Kenneth | author-link = Ken Starr | title = Report to the House on President Clinton: Narrative Pt.

'''Social protection''', as defined by the [[United Nations Research Institute For Social Development]], is concerned with preventing, managing, and overcoming situations that adversely affect people’s [[well being]].&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD). 2010.  Combating [[Poverty]] and Inequality: Structural Change, Social Policy and Politics.&lt;/ref&gt;  Social protection consists of policies and programs designed to reduce [[poverty]] and vulnerability by promoting efficient [[labour market]]s, diminishing people's exposure to risks, and enhancing their capacity to manage economic and social risks, such as [[unemployment]], [[social exclusion|exclusion]], sickness, [[disability]] and old age.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank. 2001. Social Protection Sector Strategy Paper: From Safety Net to Springboard. Washington DC, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common types of social protection:

*'''Labor market interventions''' are policies and programs designed to promote employment, the efficient operation of labor markets and the protection of workers.
*'''[[Social insurance]]''' mitigates risks associated with unemployment, ill health, disability, work-related injury and old age, such as health insurance or unemployment insurance.
*'''[[Social safety net|Social assistance]]''' is when resources, either cash or in-kind, are transferred to vulnerable individuals or households with no other means of adequate support, including single parents, the homeless, or the physically or mentally challenged.

==History of social protection==
Traditionally, social protection has been used in the [[European welfare state]] and other parts of the developed world to maintain a certain living standard, and address transient poverty.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD). 2010.  Combati
ng Poverty and Inequality: Structural Change, Social Policy and Politics.&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the first examples of state-provided social protection can be tracked to the Roman Emperor [[Trajan]], who expanded a program for free grain to include more poor citizens of the empire. In addition, he instituted public funds to support poor children.&lt;ref&gt;Hammond, Mason.  “Trajan”. Encyclopædia Britannica.  http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/602150/Trajan#tab=active~checked%2Citems~checked&amp;title=Trajan%20--%20Britannica%20Online%20Encyclopedia.&lt;/ref&gt; Organized [[welfare]] was not common until the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  It was during this period that in both Germany and Great Britain, welfare systems were established to target the working classes (see [[National Insurance]]).&lt;ref&gt;“The Liberal reforms 1906-1914”.  BBC. http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/history/mwh/britain/liberalreformsrev2.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; The United States followed several years later, during the [[Great Depression]], with emergency relief for those struck the hardest.  However, modern social protection has grown to envelop a much broader range of issues and purposes; it is now being used as a policy approach in developing nations, to address issues of persistent poverty and target structural causes.  Moreover, it is designed to lift recipients out of poverty, rather than exclusively providing passive protection against contingencies .&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD). 2010.  Combating Poverty and Inequality: Structural Change, Social Policy and Politics.&lt;/ref&gt; social protection has rapidly been used in trying to reduce and ultimately eliminate poverty and suffering in developing countries (mostly in Africa), so to enhance and promote economic and social growth.

==Types of social protection==

===Labor market Interventions===
Labor market interventions, consisting of both active and passive policies, provide protection for the poor who are capable of gaining employment. Passive programs, such as unemployment insurance, income support and changes in labor legislation, allieviate the financial needs of the unemployed but are not designed to improve their employability.&lt;ref&gt;Governance and Social Development Resource Centre. [Date accessed October 31, 2010]  (http://www.gsdrc.org/go/topic-guides/social-protection/types-of-social-protection)&lt;/ref&gt; A European Union-funded research as part of the DRIVERS project revealed a linear
relationship between investments in national active labour market policies (specifically those directed towards integrating vulnerable groups into employment) and quality of work. It found that European countries with more active labour market policies seem to have healthier, less stressed workplaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://health-gradient.eu/lower-education-leads-to-a-more-stressful-working-life-labour-market-policies-can-mitigate-this/|title=Health Gradient - EuroHealthNet|website=health-gradient.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, active programs focus on directly increasing the access of unemployed workers.&lt;ref&gt;Asian Development Bank. Labor. [Date accessed October 31, 2010]   (http://www.adb.org/SocialProtection/labor.asp)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Active labour market policies]] (ALMPs) are used to reduce the risk of unemployment and to increase the earnings capacity of workers.  ALMPs have two basic objectives: (1) economic, by increasing the ability of the unemployed to find jobs, and increase productivity and earnings; and (2) social, by improving the inclusion and participation of productive employment. These programs have the ability to increase employment opportunities and address the social problems that often accompany high unemployment.  Active policies are a way of reversing the negative effects of industrial restructuring in transition economies and to help integrate vulnerable people furthest from the labor markets.&lt;ref&gt;The World Bank. Social Protection. [Date accessed October 31, 2010] (http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTSOCIALPROTECTION/
EXTLM/0,,contentMDK:20223809~menuPK:7109967~pagePK:148956~piPK:216618~theSitePK:390615,00.html)&lt;/ref&gt;  ALMPs are often targeted to the long-term unemployed, workers in poor families, and particular groups with labor market disadvantages. These programs have important social, as well as economic, objectives.  Active labor market programs include a wide range of activities to stimulate employment and productivity such as:
*'''Employment services.''' These services include counseling, placement assistance, job matching, labor exchanges, and other related services to improve the functioning of the labor market.
*'''Job Training'''. This includes training/retraining for the unemployed, workers in mass layoffs and youth to increase the quantity of work supply.
*'''Direct employment generation''' The promotion of small and medium enterprises (e.g., public works projects, subsidies) to increase labor demand.&lt;ref&gt;Betcherman, G., Olivas, K. and Dar, A., 2004, ‘Impacts of Active Labor Market Programs: New Evidence from Evaluations with Particular Attention to Developing and Transition Countries’, Social Protection Discussion Paper Series no. 0402, World Bank, Washington&lt;/ref&gt;
A common issue in implementing successful labor market interventions is how to incorporate the informal economy, which comprises a significant portion of the workforce in developing countries.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Governance and Social Development Resource Centre. [Date accessed October 31, 2010]  (http://www.gsdrc.org/go/topic-guides/social protection/types-of-social-protection)&lt;/ref&gt; Informal employment comprises between half and three quarters of non-agricultural employment in the majority of these countries. The proportion of informal employment increases when agriculture is taken into account.&lt;ref&gt;International Labour Organization. [Date accessed October 31, 2010] (http://www.ilo.org/public/english/protection/secsoc/areas/policy/informal.htm)&lt;/ref&gt;  Most informal workers are not covered by social security schemes, occupational safety and health measures, working conditions regulations and have limited access to health services and work-related measures of social protection.  Labor market interventions work to integrate the different strategies to prevent and compensate occupational and social risks in the informal economy.  The strategies that include measures to prevent and mitigate the impact of risks are the most effective.&lt;ref&gt;Lund, F., 2009, ‘Social Protection and the Informal Economy: Linkages and Good Practices for Poverty Reduction and Empowerment’, in Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), ‘Promoting Pro-Poor Growth: Social Protection’, OECD, Paris, pp.69-88&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, public expenditure on labor market policy (LMP) interventions falls within three main categories:
*'''Labor Market Services (1)''' 
*'''Total LMP Measures (2-7)'''
training (2),
job rotation &amp; job sharing (3),
employment incentives (4),
supported employment &amp; rehabilitation (5),
direct job creation (6),
start-up incentives (7),

*'''Total LMP supports (8-9)'''
out-of-work income maintenance and support (8),
early retirement (9)

===Social insurance===
{{Main|Social insurance}}
Social insurance schemes are contributory programs that protect beneficiaries from catastrophic expenses in exchange for regular payments of premiums.   Health costs can be very high, so health insurance schemes are a popular way reducing risk in the event of shock.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; However, an individual with low income may not be able to afford insurance.  Some argue that insurance schemes should be complemented with social assistance.   Community-based health insurance allows pooling in settings where institutional capacity is too weak to organize nationwide risk-pooling, especially in low-income countries, making insurance more affordable.  In risk-sharing schemes, the insurance premium is unrelated to the likelihood that the beneficiary will fall ill and benefits are provided on the basis of need.&lt;ref&gt;Ranson, M., 2002, ‘Reduction of Catastrophic Health Care Expenditures by a Community-Based Health Insurance Scheme in Gujarat, India: Current Experiences and Challenges’, Bulletin of the World Health Organization, vol. 80, no. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social assistance===
[[Social assistance]] schemes comprise programs designed to help the most [[social vulnerability|vulnerable individuals]] ( i.e., those with no other means of support such as single parent households, victims of natural disasters or civil conflict, handicapped people, or the destitute poor), households and communities to meet a [[Social floor]] and improve living standards.  These programs consist of all forms of public action, government and non-government, that are designed to transfer resources, either cash or in-kind (e.g. food transfers), to eligible vulnerable and deprived persons.&lt;ref&gt;Howell, F., 2001, 'Social Assistance - Theoretical Background', in 'Social Protection in the Asia and Pacific', ed. I. Ortiz, Asian Development Bank, Manila, ch. 7&lt;/ref&gt;  Social assistance interventions may include:
*'''[[Welfare]] and social services''' to highly vulnerable groups such as the physically or mentally disabled, orphans, or substance abusers.
*'''Cash or in-kind transfers''' such as [[Ration stamp|food stamps]] and family allowances.
*'''Temporary subsidies''' such as life-line tariffs, housing subsidies, or support of lower prices of staple food in times of crisis.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Asian Development Bank. Social Protection. [Date accessed October 31, 2010] (http://www.adb.org/SocialProtection/default.asp)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

==Policy issues==

===Universalism vs. Targeting===
There are two main schools of thought concerning scope of social protection.  Universalism argues that each person, by merit of simply being a citizen should be entitled to benefits from social protection programs.  Such a policy would avoid [[means-testing]] and any conditionalities such as work requirements.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;   One of the greatest benefits to this policy perspective is social solidarity, since everyone contributes collaboratively to a system that everyone also benefits from.  [[Social security]] is one such example.  Moreover, economists have argued that universalism is an investment in human capital that aids the development of a nation as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Mares, I. 2007. “The economic consequences of the welfare state”.  International Social Security Review, Vol. 60, No. 2/3.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Bank]]'s 2019 [[World Development Report]] ''The Changing Nature of Work''&lt;ref&gt;[http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/816281518818814423/pdf/2019-WDR-Report.pdf World Bank World Development Report 2019: The Changing Nature of Work.]&lt;/ref&gt; considers social protection from this perspective, describing existing schemes around the world and presenting simulation data on the potential costs.
Opponents would argue that universalism is cost-ineffective and unfairly distorts individual efforts. Such an argument points toward targeting as a better solution.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Sen, Amartya. 1999. Development as Freedom. New York: Anchor Books.&lt;/ref&gt;  In such a case, the question arises of who should be the target population that receives benefits from social programs.

===Targeting income vs. capabilities===
Net income is the simplest method of determining a needy population.  Some states use a [[Guaranteed Minimum Income]] system, in which all members of a state receive sufficient income to live on, so long as they meet certain conditions.&lt;ref&gt;“History of Basic Income”.  Basic Income Earth Network. http://www.basicincome.org/bien/aboutbasicincome.html#history {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621140909/http://www.basicincome.org/bien/aboutbasicincome.html |date=2008-06-21 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, proponents of the [[capabilities approach]] argue that income is easier to misrepresent, and moreover, fails to target the root causal factors of poverty.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Hence, they recommend targeting a minimum level of basic capabilities that will impact [[quality of life]], such as institutional improvements like health and education. Policy examples might include a [[social floor]].&lt;ref&gt;ILO Social Protection Floors Recommendation No. 202 (2012) [http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_INSTRUMENT_ID:3065524 ILO Recommendation No. 202]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Means of provision===
Social protection is an expensive and difficult endeavor, by any means; the question remains how best to implement programs that effectively aid the people who need it the most.  Currently, there are a number of mechanisms that provide social protection in various nations. These policies and instruments vary according to country context. In some nations, governments are strongly involved in the provision of social protection, following a [[developmentalism]] model, in which social protection is seen as a tool to promote economic growth.  There are also nations which are characterized by dualism, in which there is state-provided protection for those who work in the formal sector, but little to no protection for those who work in the [[informal sector]].  Finally, there are nations in which the economy is largely agrarian, and a great majority of the population works in the informal economy.  In those countries that have only residual social protection coverage and weak state capacity,social protection is mainly provided by non-governmental means such as kin, [[NGO]]s, and individual philanthropic donations.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==National programs==

===Developmentalism===
In [[South Korea]] and [[Taiwan]], the government provides extensive support for public programs, following the [[developmentalism]] model, in which social protection is seen as a tool to promote economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;Kwon, Huck-Ju. 2009. “The reform of the developmental welfare state in East Asia”. International Journal of Social Welfare.  Volume 18, pages S12–S21, April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dualism===
In [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], and [[South Africa]], there is a dualist structure of protected formal sector workers and marginalized informal sector workers.,&lt;ref&gt;Lo Vuolo, Barbeito. 1998. Models of stratification via pension policy. The case of Argentina. LASA Conference, Nov. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ocampo, José Antonio. 2008. “The Latin American Economic Boom”Revista de Ciencia Política, Volume 28&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agrarian-Informal===
In nations such as [[India]] and [[Tanzania]], governments struggle to provide adequate social protection, and citizens must instead depend on non-state actors and informal provisioning.

==Donor approaches==
International donors and organizations have influenced social protection approaches both at the level of policy discourse and program design and implementation.&lt;ref&gt;See Brunori and O'Reilly (2011) for a review(http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/29495/)&lt;/ref&gt;  Even though The World Bank and International Labour Organization (ILO) are the major donors and the lead organizations in the field, other organizations are also concerned with social protection.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, S. and Kabeer, N., 2009, ‘Socio-economic Security over the Life Course: A Global Review of Social Protection’, Institute of Development Studies, Brighton(http://www.ids.ac.uk/publication/a-global-review-of-social-protection)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The World Bank]] is a source of financial and technical assistance for developing countries. In order to identify social risks and potential responses, The World Bank developed a tool called “[[Social Risk Management]]” (SRM).  The SRM framework includes interventions that focus on managing risks before shocks occur.  It is based on two assessments: (1) the poor are most exposed to diverse risks, and (2) the poor have the fewest tools to deal with these risks.  The main elements of the SRM framework are:
*''Risk reduction'' measures that focus on reducing risks in the labor market.
*''Risk mitigation'' measures to deal with anticipated shock.
*''Risk coping'' mechanisms to relieve the impact of risk after its occurred.&lt;ref&gt;The World Bank. Social Protection. [Date accessed October 31, 2010] (http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTSOCIALPROTECTION/EXTLM/0,,contentMDK:20223809~menuPK:7109967~pagePK:148956~piPK:216618~theSitePK:390615,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) brings 30 democratic countries together to seek answers to common problems and coordinate domestic and international policies.  The [[Development Assistance Committee]] (DAC) of the OECD is responsible for the Poverty Network (POVNET) that has become very influential on policy development.  The DAC-POVNET focuses on the following areas:
*Poverty reduction
*[http://www.oecd.org/document/1/0,3746,en_2649_34621_36573761_1_1_1_1,00.html Pro-poor growth]
*People centered development

The [[International Labour Organization]], which covers both issues of social security and labor protection, has been the [[United Nations]] agency responsible for setting norms and standards at work.  Currently the ILO focuses, amongst others, on the following strategies: 
*Extending social protection to all
*Promoting decent working conditions
*Providing programs for informal and migrant workers &lt;ref&gt;Cook, S. and Kabeer, N., 2009, ‘Socio-economic Security over the Life Course: A Global Review of Social Protection’, Institute of Development Studies, Brighton&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Sophy Sanger was born on 3 January 1881 in [[Westcott, Surrey|Westcott]], [[Surrey]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=Sophy Sanger: A pioneer in internationalism|date=1958|publisher=University Press|year=|isbn=|location=Glasgow|pages=|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=2x7RAAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=westcott|last1=Allen|first1=A.M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}} She was the youngest daughter of the wealthy London businessman Charles Sanger and Jessie Alice Pulford.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/37934|title=Sanger, Sophy (1881–1950)|last=Oldfield|first=Sybil|date=2004|website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 15, she was sent to Dr. Elizabeth Dawes' school in [[Weybridge]], where she was the only pupil to be taught mathematics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She went up to [[Newnham College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] in autumn 1899. Sophy began by studying the [[Mathematical Tripos]] from 1899 to 1902 and went on to read [[Human science|moral sciences]] in 1903.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It was in Cambridge at a debate in the Newnham Parliament that Sophy first became interested in politics; listening to a speech by the [[Quaker]] [[Dr Hilda Clark|Hilda Clark]] sparked in her a commitment to [[pacifism]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|26}}

== Work ==
Sophy Sanger worked for the [[Women's Trade Union League (United Kingdom)|Women's Trade Union League]] from 1903 to 1909, setting up its legal advice bureau whilst learning labour law at University College London.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Her work on insurance regulations for workplace compensation meant she was called to give evidence before a parliamentary commission in the [[House of Lords]] and she helped Labour MPs prepare their case for the Shops Bill.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1905, Sanger founded a British section of the International Association for Labour Legislation, publishing an English version of its French and German ''Bulletins''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Between 1909 and 1919, she wrote for and edited ''World's Labour Laws'', a quarterly publication which campaigned on issues such as the abolition of child labour, the prohibition of the use of [[White phosphorus munitions|white phosphorus]] and [[lead]] and the prevention of [[anthrax]]. She believed that international cooperation and action on specific, practical reforms could effectively combat many worker's rights issues, for example: [[sweated labour]], [[occupational disease]] and workplace injury.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Sophy Sanger was appointed chief of the [[International Labour Organization]]'s legislative section, a post she held from its formation in 1919 until 1924.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She returned to Britain in 1924 and read for the bar at [[Gray's Inn]], publishing an authoritative article on labour law for the ''[[Encyclopaedia Britannica]]''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|259}}

{{refimprove|date=July 2017}}
In general, '''spectacle''' refers to an event that is memorable for the appearance it creates. Derived in [[Middle English]] from c. 1340 as "specially prepared or arranged display" it was borrowed from [[Old French]] ''spectacle'', itself a reflection of the [[Latin]] ''spectaculum'' "a show" from ''spectare'' "to view, watch" frequentative form of ''specere'' "to look at."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=spectacle&amp;searchmode=none Online Etymological Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''spectacle'' has also been a [[term of art]] in theater dating from the 17th century in English [[drama]].
==The masque and spectacle==
Court [[masque]]s and masques of the nobility were most popular in the [[James I of England|Jacobean]] and [[Charles I of England|Caroline]] era.  Such masques, as their name implies, relied heavily upon a non-verbal theater.  The character lists for masques would be quite small, in keeping with the ability of a small family of patrons to act, but the [[costume]]s and theatrical effects would be lavish.  Reading the text of masques, such as ''The Masque at Ludlow'' (most often referred to as ''[[Comus (John Milton)|Comus]]''), the writing is spare, philosophical, and grandiose, with very few marks of traditional dramatic structure.  This is partially due to the purpose of the masque being family entertainment and spectacle.  Unlike ''The Masque at Ludlow'', most masques were recreations of well-known mythological or religious scenes.  Some masques would derive from tableau.  For example, [[Edmund Spenser]] (''Fairie Queene'' I, iv) describes a masque of ''The [[Seven Deadly Sins]]''.  

Masques were [[multimedia]], for they almost always involved costuming and music as a method of conveying the story or narrative.  [[Ben Jonson]], for example, wrote masques with the architect [[Inigo Jones]].  [[William Davenant]], who would become one of the major [[impresario]]s of the [[English Restoration]], also wrote pre-Revolutionary masques with Inigo Jones.  The role of the architect was that of designer of the staging, which would be elaborate and often culminate in a [[fireworks]] show.

==The Hollywood spectacular==
When the [[zoetrope]] and [[Nickelodeon (movie theater)|nickelodeon]] technology first appeared, the earliest films were spectacles.  They caught the attention of common people. They showed things people would rarely see, and they showed it to the wide audience.
* [[Thomas Edison]] filmed [[Eiffel Tower]], actual [[American Indians in the United States|American Indians]] in a simulated attack, and even celebrated [[beauty contest|beauty queens]].
* [[Louis Lumière]] filmed a train pulling into a station in 1895 (''[[L'Arrivée d'un train en gare de La Ciotat]]''). The camera was in front of the train, and the train "came" directly at the viewer. It astonished people unaccustomed to the illusion created by moving images.

==Spectacle and society==
Within industrial and post-industrial cultural and state formations, '''spectacle''' has been appropriated to describe appearances that are purported to be simultaneously enticing, deceptive, distracting and superficial. ([[Jonathan  Crary]]: 2005)  Current academic theories of spectacle "highlight how the productive forces of marketing, often associated with media and Internet proliferation, create symbolic forms of practice that are emblematic of everyday situations"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Alex|last2=Stringfellow|first2=Lindsay|last3=Maclean|first3=Mairi|last4=MacLaren|first4=Andrew|last5=O’Gorman|first5=Kevin|date=2015-03-24|title=Puppets of necessity? Celebritisation in structured reality television|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0267257X.2014.988282|journal=Journal of Marketing Management|volume=31|issue=5-6|pages=478–501|doi=10.1080/0267257X.2014.988282|issn=0267-257X}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Spectacle can also refer to a society that critics describe as dominated by [[electronic media]], [[consumption (economics)|consumption]], and [[surveillance]], reducing citizens to spectators by political neutralization. Recently the word has been associated with the many ways in which a [[capitalist]] structure is purported to create play-like celebrations of its products and leisure time consumption. The work of French Marxist thinker [[Guy Debord]] is perhaps the best-known example of this critical analysis; see his ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]'' (1967)

In a diagram from the book ''The Automated Society'',&lt;ref&gt; Bloomfield, Masse, ''The Automated Society'', Masefield Books, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Bloomfield defines the history of humanity beginning over two million years ago and ending over a hundred thousand years in the future. The diagram is base on biological [[punctuated equilibrium]] and a parallel [[cultural evolution]]. The predictions of the [[future]] follow what has happened in the past.

The diagram of [[history]] shows humanity having long periods of stability interrupted with short periods of transition. Humanity is currently experiencing one of those short periods of transition, from a stable agricultural period going through a transitional [[industrial society]] leading to a stable automated period. [[Productivity]] is the key to the transition; when it is impossible to increase productivity, humanity will have arrived at the automated society.

Before humanity enters the automated society, we will suffer from two near term trends. One trend is the relentlessly increasing number of human beings. The second is the relentlessly decreasing number of jobs. Jobs will be eliminated by substituting men with machines. An example of this is agriculture where once in the peasant society there were ninety percent of the people working as farmers. With the introduction of tractors, only three percent of Americans work on the farm.

Once the problems of the lack of jobs, increased [[pollution]] and fewer natural resources are solved and the food factory put in operation, there should be a reconciliation of man to [[automation]]. In the automated society, men will live in affluence along with a total control of [[population]]. The one place where man will have an unlimited future will be in space. [[Space]] can provide for an unlimited increase in population and potentially the introduction of new human biological species.

[[File:Thevar Jayanthi in Madurai, 2007.jpg|thumb|200px|Garlanding Pasumpon Muthuramalingam Thevar's statue in [[Madurai]] during the 2007 Thevar Jayanthi centenary]]'''''Thevar Jayanthi''''', celebrated on 30 October, is an annual commemoration of the birthday of [[U. Muthuramalingam Thevar|Pasumpon Muthuramalingam Thevar]]. It is celebrated in a grand way by the [[Thevar]] community in the southern districts of [[Tamil Nadu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/1998/oct/28tn1.htm |title=Security beefed up in Madurai for Thevar Jayanthi |publisher=[[Rediff.com]] |date=28 October 1998 |accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although not an official public holiday, many schools and businesses in the area remain closed on the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/10/31/stories/2006103105270300.htm |title=Thevar jayanthi processions peaceful |publisher=[[The Hindu]] |date=31 October 2006 |accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2005/10/31/stories/2005103116560300.htm |title=Thevar jayanthi processions pass off peacefully |publisher=[[The Hindu]] |date=31 October 2005 |accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/10/31/stories/2007103159910300.htm |title=Thevar jayanthi processions peaceful |publisher=[[The Hindu]] |date=31 October 2007 |accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thevar's legacy==
Whilst having been active in politics, it is mainly the spiritual discourse of Thevar that explains his following after his death. Also, the fact that his date of birth and death lie some close to each other has been interpreted as a sign of supernatural powers.&lt;ref name="s"/&gt;

==Thevar Samadhi==
One of the main events on Thevar Jayanthi takes place at the ''samadhi'' (burial place) of Pasumpon Muthuramalingam Thevar, located at some 50 miles distance from [[Madurai]]. Pilgrims gather to take part in the ceremonies at the ''samadhi'' on 30 October. In later years the ceremony at the ''samadhi'' has begun to attract prominent politicians.&lt;ref name="s"&gt;Robinson, Rowena. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=2cIOqGcvHqoC&amp;pg=PA167 Sociology of Religion in India]''. New Delhi [u.a.]: SAGE, 2004. pp. 165-168&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political controversy==
The [[All India Forward Bloc]], the [[political party]] to which Pasumpon Muthuramalingam Thevar belonged, has demanded that Thevar Jayanthi be declared a public holiday in Tamil Nadu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.webindia123.com/news/ar_showdetails.asp?id=710090655&amp;cat=&amp;n_date=20071009 |title=Mid term polls linked to Cong stand on US nuke pact: AIFB|publisher=webindia123.com |date=9 October 2007 |accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The event is not entirely uncontroversial. The [[CPI(ML) Liberation]] has charged that the Tamil Nadu government should stop sponsoring Thevar Jayanthi celebrations, claiming that the event is utilised by [[caste]]ist forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpiml.org/liberation/year_2009/jan_09/reports.html |title=Kerala : Land Reforms Undone |publisher=[[Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) Liberation]]|date= |accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2007 centenary celebrations==
On 30 October 2007, the birth centenary of Pasumpon Muthuramalingam Thevar was celebrated. Tamil Nadu Chief Minister [[M. Karunanidhi]] took part in the celebrations in [[Pasumpon]] village.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.oneindia.in/2007/10/30/karunanidhi-jaya-pay-floral-tributes-to-muthuramalinga-thevar-1193737346.html |title=Karunanidhi, Jaya pay floral tributes to Muthuramalinga Thevar|publisher=[[Oneindia.in]]|date=30 October 2007 |accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first time in two decades that Karunanidhi participated in Thevar Jayanthi.&lt;ref name="ind"/&gt; At the celebrations, Karunanidhi suggested that [[Madurai Airport]] be renamed after Pasumpon Muthuramalingam Thevar. These moves were seen as an attempt by Karunanidhi's [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (DMK) party to challenge the supremacy of the rival [[All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (AIADMK) over the Thevar community. The AIADMK leader [[J. Jayalalitha]] criticised Karunanidhi's participation in the Thevar Jayanthi centenary programme, stating that he did not believe in Thevar's ideas. Moreover, she claimed that her previous government had allocated 30&amp;nbsp;million [[Indian rupee|rupees]] for the Thevar Jayanthi centenary, but that Karunanidhi's government had spent only five million rupees.&lt;ref name="ind"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianchristians.in/news/content/view/1732/48/ |title=New Icon, Old Wounds |publisher=All India Christian Council|date=23 November 2007 |accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''USPID''' (''Unione Scienziati per il Disarmo'' in [[Italian language|Italian]]) is the '''Italian Union of Scientists for Disarmament''', an association established in 1982 with the purpose of providing information about and analysis of arms control and [[disarmament]].

Members of USPID believe that this task is part of the social responsibility of scientists.

The issues addressed by USPID include [[nuclear weapon|nuclear arms]]-control and disarmament, nuclear proliferation, consequences of nuclear explosions, control of fissile material, developments of military technology, conventional disarmament, chemical and biological disarmament, problems of conflicts and conflict resolution.

Members of USPID, both individually and collectively, share their views with Italian policy-makers and opinion-makers.

USPID organizes conferences and meetings, including the biennial Castiglioncello conference (now at its 11th edition), courses and seminars in Italian Universities, courses for high-school teachers.

USPID promotes the establishment of inter-departmental Centers affiliated to Italian Universities, and has actively collaborated for many years with the CIRP-UniBa (Centro Interdipartimentale di Ricerche sulla Pace, [[University of Bari]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}} Universita' di Bari&lt;/ref&gt;

USPID collaborates with international organizations of scientists and other Italian institutions, such as Archivio Disarmo (Roma), Forum per i Problemi della Pace e della Guerra (Firenze). Members of USPID participate in [[Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs|Pugwash]] and ISODARCO meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 USPID began a standing collaboration with Landau Network-Centro Volta, Como (Italy).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Centro Landau |accessdate=2009-05-20 |url=http://lxmi.mi.infn.it/~landnet/landau.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327215408/http://lxmi.mi.infn.it/~landnet/landau.html |archivedate=March 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This institution organizes, together with [[UNESCO]] and under the sponsorship of the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, conferences and research projects on different topics, including disarmament, non-proliferation and scientific-technological aspects of International Security.
