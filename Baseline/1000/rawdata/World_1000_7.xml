[[Globalization|Globalization’s]] impact on [[gender inequality]] in the 21st century in the [[United States|USA]] and around the world has surfaced as a contentious issue. While some argue that globalization is beneficial, it is also claimed that not everyone is benefiting from globalization equally. In particular, females often do not benefit to the extent of their male counterparts. Contemporary globalizing forces such as the [[World Bank]] and the [[United Nations]] have worked to deconstruct the barriers of inequality and existing gender gaps. As a result, this article is focused on the 21st century economic transformation that has emerged through globalization as it has impacted not only global markets, but also, the overall landscape at an individual level. At the same time, there is a need to present the various struggles and existing realities of gender inequality in America’s workforce, which still finds itself on the path towards full equality.

==Economic opportunities==
Globalization has brought increased access to economic opportunities. Most of these opportunities have come as a result of trade openness and the spread of information and communication technologies (ICTs). This has led to an increase in women's access to economic opportunities and in some cases increased their wages relative to men's. More specifically, the World Bank claims, “trade openness and the diffusion of new information and technologies have translated into more jobs and stronger connections to markets for many women”.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank, 2011, 'Globalization's Impact on Gender Equality: What's happened and what's needed', in World Development Report 2012: Gender Equality, World Bank, Washington DC, Ch. 6. 254-277.&lt;/ref&gt; Increased access to information, primarily through television and the Internet, allows the general American public to learn about social mores in other places, which can change perceptions and promote the establishment of egalitarian attitudes. Instead, egalitarian attitudes are currently hindered by the existing reality of woman making up the majority of the low-wage workforce industry. More specifically, the [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO), in a recent report shows that “in 2010, women constituted 59 percent of the low-wage workforce”.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations. http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/csw/beirutglobal.htm. Web. January 16. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Globalizing organizations and institutions such as the United Nations, and the World Bank have worked to promote gender equality. The task has not been easy given the need to undo many institutionalized and systemic influences on gender equality. Thus, the ability to override these forms of oppression stems from spreading awareness. Globalizing institutions have used increased awareness to shed light issues of gender inequality, particularly in the work force. For example, “The Beijing + 5 process provides an opportunity to reflect on the impact of Globalization in determining further actions and initiatives for the full implementation of the Beijing commitments”.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations. http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/csw/beirutglobal.htm. Web. January 16. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the ability to promote awareness is by default facilitated because, for example, in the nonagricultural sector, the total share percentage of women employed is at 48% from a 2012 report. Thus, when the gender binaries of male and female in the U.S. constitute half of the entire workforce respectively, the females that receive unequal treatment have the ability to speak out against the cause with the understanding that a high proportion of the public backs them.

==Public perceptions==
Public opinion in the USA on Globalization and its impacts on gender inequality has been shaped by denial of basic [[human rights]] in the workforce abroad. The World Bank states that  “Public opinion in developed countries generally connects globalization with sweatshops where child labor is common and workers are denied the most basic rights”.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank, 2011, 'Globalization's Impact on Gender Equality: What's happened and what's needed', in World Development Report 2012: Gender Equality, World Bank, Washington DC, Ch. 6. Pg. 267&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the issue of sweatshops is acute in the informal sector. For example, the arrangements such as sub-contracting and outsourcing have become an integral part of the contemporary market economy. Thus, issues of unfair pay and poor working environments are commonly interpreted as issues abroad. However, there remains high contestation against transnationals that allow these issues to happen in the first place through the act of shifting their manufacturing bases away from the U.S. and into other countries with lenient regulations and restrictions.

==Gender roles in industries==
Globalization's impact on gender inequality has also had its fair share of benefits in the U.S. to the extent that the “demand for female workers in the export and ICT-enabled sectors has increased, and as women have filled these new jobs”.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank, 2011, 'Globalization's Impact on Gender Equality: What's happened and what's needed', in [[World Development Report]] 2012: Gender Equality, World Bank, Washington DC, Ch. 6. 254-277. Pg. 254&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. has been on the forefront of the technological advancements around the world. As a result, the ICT industry impacts and reflects both a benefit, and a hindrance to gender inequality. This is mostly due to the reality that forces of globalization are real and their influences are felt everywhere. More specifically, the Inter-agency network on women and gender equality by the United Nations claims, “Equitable access to information and Communication technologies can be an important tool for empowering women.” ICT can empower women through increasing their activity, as well as help reduce gender inequalities by “reducing women’s and girls’ time demands, increasing their access to income-generating activities, and allowing them to benefit from technological advances”.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations, September 2005, ‘Women2000 and Beyond: Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women through ICT’. Pg. 2-35.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is also argued that ICT sectors have not necessarily helped women. Instead, “women are under-represented in ICT decision making structures including policy and regulatory institutions”.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations, September 2005, ‘Women2000 and Beyond: Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women through ICT’. Pg 9&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the workforce continues to fluctuate between becoming increasingly viewed as supportive of gender equality as well as the belief that it has promoted precisely the opposite.

While there is a strong concentration around the role of women, they are the ones that mostly suffer from gender inequality. However, there are also masculine organizations that also promote the need to fix the issue of gender inequality. There is an existing belief that “Men and boys are thus, in several ways, gatekeepers for gender equality and should be targeted and included in efforts to promote gender equality so as to ensure men’s support and partnership”.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilo.org/gender/Informationresources/WCMS_232755/lang--en/index.htm. Web. January 16. 2014. page 5.&lt;/ref&gt; It is only through a collective effort that gender equality can flourish. However, it should be noted that the reality of gender inequality in the U.S. is one where men also “face vulnerabilities because of gender inequality, such as experiencing stress from being regarded, and regarding themselves, as the main breadwinner”.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilo.org/gender/Informationresources/WCMS_232755/lang--en/index.htm. Web. January 16. 2014. Pg 7&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, failing to get a job, or losing their job and the inability to earn enough money can also lead to an erosion of their self-worth as men.

==Continuing inequality==
There are various studies available that depict globalization as a hindrance toward gender inequality. For example, shortly before the transition into the 21st century, “recent studies such as UNCTAD’s Trade and Development Report (1997) and the UNDP’s Human Development Reports (1997 and 1999) suggest that economic growth fostered by recent liberalization policies can be accompanied by increased inequality and a decline in living standards".&lt;ref&gt;United Nations. http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/csw/beirutglobal.htm. Web. January 16. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; However, on the other hand, positive effects may include “increased employment opportunities for women in non-traditional sectors” thus enabling them to earn and control income" &lt;ref&gt;United Nations. http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/csw/beirutglobal.htm. Web. January 16. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the USA serves as one of the key players in the international system that is not to say that it is immune to the gender pay gaps that exist around the world. In fact, the great recession and [[financial crisis of 2007-2008]] demonstrates the reality of these inequalities given that men and women were affected differently. Statistically, in the U.S. alone, men lost more jobs than women in the recession. But at the same time, men also experienced a steadier recovery. “One in five women are working part time because they cannot find full time work while at the start of the recession less than one in ten women were doing so”.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilo.org/washington/areas/gender-equality-in-the-workplace/WCMS_159496/lang--en/index.htm. Web. January 16. 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these developments, the overall unemployment rate for women is lower than men’s and they are also less likely to be among the long-term unemployed.

21st century globalization and its impact on gender equality remains highly influenced by the past. The World Bank openly admitted to the influence of the past by claiming, “even among those who have benefited from higher access to economic opportunities, old patterns of employment segregation by gender can emerge”.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank, 2011, 'Globalization's Impact on Gender Equality: What's happened and what's needed', in World Development Report 2012: Gender Equality, World Bank, Washington DC, Ch. 6. 254-277. Page 268&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the ability to undermine these old patterns is by continually raising awareness. The ability to raise awareness and counter old patterns is prominent in the U.S. and visible through globalizing organization-sponsored groups. One important group that has worked to raise awareness is known as WomenWatch, a United Nations inter-agency website on gender equality reducing women’s and girls’ time demands, increasing their access to income-generating activities, and allowing them to benefit from technological advances”.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations, September 2005, ‘Women2000 and Beyond: Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women through ICT’. Pg. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Their mission is essentially to shed light to the various ways gender equality can become a reality if everyone’s concerns converge and coalesce.

Globalization on its own cannot end gender inequality. There should be an understanding that the Globalization process as a whole offers both opportunities, as well as challenges for human development. Consequently, a collective effort implies an understanding that “the specific gender-related needs of men are overlooked, as well as the important role that men can play in achieving gender equality and empowering women”.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilo.org/gender/Informationresources/WCMS_232755/lang--en/index.htm. Web. January 16. 2014&lt;/ref&gt; It is precisely through understanding the dynamics of gender inequality while incorporating both males and females into the playing field that equality can ultimately be achieved.

'''Asia''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|eɪ|ʒ|ə|,_|ˈ|eɪ|ʃ|ə|audio=En-us-Asia.ogg}}) is [[Earth]]'s largest and most populous [[continent]], located primarily in the [[Eastern Hemisphere|Eastern]] and [[Northern Hemisphere|Northern]] [[Hemisphere of the Earth|Hemispheres]]. It shares the continental landmass of [[Eurasia]] with the continent of [[Europe]] and the continental landmass of [[Afro-Eurasia]] with both Europe and [[Africa]]. Asia covers an area of {{convert|44,579,000|km2|sqmi}}, about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the [[human population]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The World at Six Billion |url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/sixbillion/sixbillion.htm |publisher=UN Population Division |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305042434/http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/sixbillion/sixbillion.htm |archivedate=5 March 2016 |deadurl=no}}, [https://web.archive.org/web/20160101220025/http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/sixbillion/sixbilpart1.pdf Table 2]&lt;/ref&gt; was the site of many of the [[first civilization]]s. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements, as well as vast barely populated regions. Its 4.5 billion people ({{as of|2018|09}}) constitute roughly 60% of the world's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.populationof.net/asia/|title=Population of Asia. 2018 demographics: density, ratios, growth rate, clock, rate of men to women.|website=www.populationof.net|accessdate=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general terms, Asia is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, on the south by the Indian Ocean, and on the north by the Arctic Ocean. The border of Asia with Europe is a historical and [[cultural construct]], as there is no clear physical and geographical separation between them. It is somewhat arbitrary and has moved since its first conception in [[classical antiquity]]. The division of Eurasia into two continents reflects [[East–West dichotomy|East-West]] cultural, linguistic, and ethnic differences, some of which vary on a spectrum rather than with a sharp dividing line. The most commonly accepted boundaries place Asia to the east of the [[Suez Canal]] separating it from Africa; and to the east of the [[Turkish Straits]], the [[Ural Mountains]] and [[Ural River]], and to the south of the [[Caucasus Mountains]] and the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] and [[Black Sea]]s, separating it from Europe.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book |title=National Geographic Atlas of the World |edition=7th |year=1999 |location=Washington, DC |publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] |isbn=978-0792275282}} "Europe" (pp. 68–69); "Asia" (pp. 90–91): "A commonly accepted division between Asia and Europe is formed by the Ural Mountains, Ural River, Caspian Sea, Caucasus Mountains, and the Black Sea with its outlets, the Bosporus and Dardanelles."&lt;/ref&gt;

Given its size and diversity, the concept of Asia—a [[toponymy|name]] dating back to [[classical antiquity]]—may actually have more to do with [[human geography]] than [[physical geography]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Asia varies greatly across and within [[Regions of Asia|its regions]] with regard to ethnic groups, cultures, environments, economics, historical ties and government systems. It also has a mix of many different climates ranging from the equatorial south via the hot desert in the [[Middle East]], temperate areas in the east and the &lt;!-- extremely --&gt; continental centre to vast subarctic and polar areas in [[Siberia]].

The border between Asia and Europe was historically defined by European academics.&lt;ref name="NatGeo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2013/07/09/geography-in-the-news-eurasias-boundaries/ |title=Geography in the News: Eurasia's Boundaries |author=Neal Lineback |publisher=National Geographic |date=9 July 2013 |accessdate=9 June 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508224947/http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2013/07/09/geography-in-the-news-eurasias-boundaries/ |archivedate=8 May 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]] became unsatisfactory to northern Europeans when [[Peter the Great]], king of the [[Tsardom of Russia]], defeating rival claims of [[Sweden]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]] to the eastern lands, and armed resistance by the tribes of [[Siberia]], synthesized a new [[Russian Empire]] extending to the [[Ural Mountains]] and beyond, founded in 1721. The major geographical theorist of the empire was actually a former Swedish prisoner-of-war, taken at the [[Battle of Poltava]] in 1709 and assigned to [[Tobolsk]], where he associated with Peter's Siberian official, [[Vasily Tatishchev]], and was allowed freedom to conduct geographical and anthropological studies in preparation for a future book.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

In Sweden, five years after Peter's death, in 1730 [[Philip Johan von Strahlenberg]] published a new atlas proposing the Urals as the border of Asia. The Russians were enthusiastic about the concept, which allowed them to keep their European identity in geography. Tatishchev announced that he had proposed the idea to von Strahlenberg. The latter had suggested the [[Emba River]] as the lower boundary. Over the next century various proposals were made until the [[Ural River]] prevailed in the mid-19th century. The border had been moved perforce from the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea into which the Ural River projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|Wigen|1997|pp=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The border between the Black Sea and the Caspian is usually placed along the crest of the [[Caucasus Mountains]], although it is sometimes placed further north.&lt;ref name="NatGeo"/&gt;

===Asia–Oceania boundary===
The border between Asia and the region of [[Oceania]] is usually placed somewhere in the [[Malay Archipelago]]. The [[Maluku Islands]] in Indonesia are often considered to lie on the border of southeast Asia, with [[New Guinea]], to the east of the islands, being wholly part of Oceania. The terms Southeast Asia and Oceania, devised in the 19th century, have had several vastly different geographic meanings since their inception. The chief factor in determining which islands of the Malay Archipelago are Asian has been the location of the colonial possessions of the various empires there (not all European). Lewis and Wigen assert, "The narrowing of 'Southeast Asia' to its present boundaries was thus a gradual process."&lt;ref name="Myth"&gt;{{harvnb | Lewis | Wigen | 1997 | pp=170–173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ongoing definition===

Geographical Asia is a cultural artifact of European conceptions of the world, beginning with the [[Ancient Greeks]], being imposed onto other cultures, an imprecise concept causing endemic contention about what it means. Asia is larger and more culturally diverse than Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|Wigen|1997|pp=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; It does not exactly correspond to the cultural borders of its various types of constituents.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|Wigen|1997|pp=7–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the time of [[Herodotus]] a minority of geographers have rejected the three-continent system (Europe, Africa, Asia) on the grounds that there is no substantial physical separation between them.&lt;ref name=McG-H&gt;{{cite web |title=Asia |url=http://accessscience.com/abstract.aspx?id=054800&amp;referURL=http%3a%2f%2faccessscience.com%2fcontent.aspx%3fid%3d054800 |work=AccessScience |publisher=McGraw-Hill |accessdate=26 July 2011 |archivedate=27 November 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111127141127/http://accessscience.com/abstract.aspx?id=054800&amp;referURL=http%3A%2F%2Faccessscience.com%2Fcontent.aspx%3Fid%3D054800 |deadurl=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Sir [[Barry Cunliffe]], the emeritus professor of European archeology at Oxford, argues that Europe has been geographically and culturally merely "the western excrescence of the continent of Asia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200812/editors-choice |title=Geography Is Destiny |first=Benjamin |last=Schwartz |journal=The Atlantic |date=December 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930211221/http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200812/editors-choice |archivedate=30 September 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geographically, Asia is the major eastern constituent of the continent of [[Eurasia]] with Europe being a northwestern [[peninsula]] of the landmass. Asia, Europe and Africa make up a single continuous landmass – [[Afro-Eurasia]] (except for the Suez Canal) – and share a common [[continental shelf]]. Almost all of Europe and the better part of Asia sit atop the [[Eurasian Plate]], adjoined on the south by the [[Arabian Plate|Arabian]] and [[Indian Plate]] and with the easternmost part of Siberia (east of the [[Chersky Range]]) on the [[North American Plate]].

==Etymology==
[[File:Gulf5..JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|Ptolemy's Asia]]
The idea of a place called "Asia" was originally a concept of [[Greek civilization]],&lt;ref name="reid"&gt;[[T.R. Reid|Reid, T.R.]] ''[[Confucius Lives Next Door: What living in the East teaches us about living in the west]]'' Vintage Books(1999).&lt;/ref&gt; though this might not correspond to the entire continent currently known by that name. The English word comes from Latin literature, where it has the same form, "Asia". Whether "Asia" in other languages comes from Latin of the [[Roman Empire]] is much less certain, and the ultimate source of the Latin word is uncertain, though several theories have been published. One of the first classical writers to use Asia as a name of the whole continent was [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=Asia&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|title=Asia – Origin and meaning of Asia by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=Etymonline.com|accessdate=9 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525113914/http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=Asia&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|archivedate=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[metonymy|metonymical]] change in meaning is common and can be observed in some other geographical names, such as [[Skandinavia]] (from [[Scania]]).

===Bronze Age===
Before Greek poetry, the [[Aegean Sea]] area was in a [[Greek Dark Age]], at the beginning of which syllabic writing was lost and alphabetic writing had not begun. Prior to then in the [[Bronze Age]] the records of the [[Assyrian Empire]], the [[Hittite Empire]] and the various [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] states of Greece mention a region undoubtedly Asia, certainly in Anatolia, including if not identical to Lydia. These records are administrative and do not include poetry.

The Mycenaean states were destroyed about 1200 BCE by unknown agents although one school of thought assigns the [[Dorian invasion]] to this time. The burning of the palaces baked clay diurnal administrative records written in a Greek syllabic script called [[Linear B]], deciphered by a number of interested parties, most notably by a young World War II cryptographer, [[Michael Ventris]], subsequently assisted by the scholar, [[John Chadwick]]. A major cache discovered by [[Carl Blegen]] at the site of ancient [[Pylos]] included hundreds of male and female names formed by different methods.

Some of these are of women held in servitude (as study of the society implied by the content reveals). They were used in trades, such as cloth-making, and usually came with children. The epithet ''lawiaiai'', "captives", associated with some of them identifies their origin. Some are ethnic names. One in particular, aswiai, identifies "women of Asia".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ventris|Chadwick|1973|p=536}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps they were captured in Asia, but some others, Milatiai, appear to have been of [[Miletus]], a Greek colony, which would not have been raided for slaves by Greeks. Chadwick suggests that the names record the locations where these foreign women were purchased.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ventris|Chadwick|1973|p=410}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name is also in the singular, Aswia, which refers both to the name of a country and to a female of it. There is a masculine form, aswios. This Aswia appears to have been a remnant of a region known to the Hittites as Assuwa, centered on Lydia, or "Roman Asia". This name, ''Assuwa'', has been suggested as the origin for the name of the continent "Asia".&lt;ref&gt;Bossert, Helmut T., ''Asia'', Istanbul, 1946.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Assuwa league]] was a confederation of states in western Anatolia, defeated by the [[Hittites]] under [[Tudhaliya I]] around 1400 BCE.

Alternatively, the [[etymology]] of the term may be from the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] word ''(w)aṣû(m)'', which means 'to go outside' or 'to ascend', referring to the direction of the sun at sunrise in the Middle East and also likely connected with the Phoenician word ''asa'' meaning east. This may be contrasted to a similar etymology proposed for ''Europe'', as being from Akkadian ''erēbu(m)'' 'to enter' or 'set' (of the sun).

[[T.R. Reid]] supports this alternative etymology, noting that the ancient Greek name must have derived from ''asu'', meaning 'east' in [[Assyria]]n (''ereb'' for ''Europe'' meaning 'west').&lt;ref name="reid"/&gt; The ideas of ''Occidental'' (form [[Latin]] ''Occidens'' 'setting') and ''Oriental'' (from Latin ''Oriens'' for 'rising') are also European invention, synonymous with ''Western'' and ''Eastern''.&lt;ref name="reid"/&gt; Reid further emphasizes that it explains the Western point of view of placing all the peoples and cultures of Asia into a single classification, almost as if there were a need for setting the distinction between Western and [[Eastern world|Eastern civilizations]] on the [[Eurasia]]n continent.&lt;ref name="reid"/&gt; Ogura Kazuo and Tenshin Okakura are two outspoken Japanese figures on the subject.&lt;ref name="reid"/&gt;

===Classical antiquity===
[[File:Roman Empire - Asia (125 AD).svg|thumb|The province of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]] highlighted (in red) within the Roman Empire.]]
Latin Asia and Greek Ἀσία appear to be the same word. Roman authors translated Ἀσία as Asia. The Romans named a province [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]], located in western Anatolia (in modern-day Turkey). There was an Asia Minor and an Asia Major located in modern-day [[Iraq]]. As the earliest evidence of the name is Greek, it is likely circumstantially that Asia came from Ἀσία, but ancient transitions, due to the lack of literary contexts, are difficult to catch in the act. The most likely vehicles were the ancient geographers and historians, such as [[Herodotus]], who were all Greek. [[Ancient Greek]] certainly evidences early and rich uses of the name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D*%29asi%2Fa |title=Ἀσία |author=Henry George Liddell |author2=Robert Scott |author3=Henry Stuart Jones |author4=Roderick McKenzie |encyclopedia=A Greek-English Lexicon |year=2007 |location=Medford |publisher=Perseus Digital Library, Tufts University |origyear=1940 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427042823/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D*%29asi%2Fa |archivedate=27 April 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first continental use of Asia is attributed to Herodotus (about 440 BCE), not because he innovated it, but because his ''Histories'' are the earliest surviving prose to describe it in any detail. He defines it carefully,&lt;ref&gt;Book IV, Articles 37–40.&lt;/ref&gt; mentioning the previous geographers whom he had read, but whose works are now missing. By it he means [[Anatolia]] and the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]], in contrast to [[Greece]] and [[Egypt]].

Herodotus comments that he is puzzled as to why three women's names were "given to a tract which is in reality one" ([[Europa (mythology)|Europa]], [[Asia (mythology)|Asia]], and [[Libya (mythology)|Libya]], referring to Africa), stating that most Greeks assumed that Asia was named after the wife of [[Prometheus]] (i.e. [[Hesione]]), but that the [[Lydia]]ns say it was named after Asies, son of Cotys, who passed the name on to a tribe at [[Sardis]].&lt;ref&gt;Book IV, Article 45.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Greek mythology]], "[[Asia (mythology)|Asia]]" (''Ἀσία'') or "Asie" (''Ἀσίη'') was the name of a "[[Nymph]] or [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] goddess of Lydia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theoi.com/Nymphe/NympheAsie.html |title=Asie |work=Encyclopedia: Greek Gods, Spirits, Monsters |publisher=Theoi Greek Mythology, Exploring Mythology in Classical Literature and Art |date=2000–2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604045105/http://www.theoi.com/Nymphe/NympheAsie.html |archivedate=4 June 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ancient Greek religion, places were under the care of female divinities, parallel to guardian angels. The poets detailed their doings and generations in allegoric language salted with entertaining stories, which subsequently playwrights transformed into classical Greek drama and became "Greek mythology". For example, [[Hesiod]] mentions the daughters of [[Tethys (mythology)|Tethys]] and [[Oceanus|Ocean]], among whom are a "holy company", "who with the Lord [[Apollo]] and the Rivers have youths in their keeping".&lt;ref&gt;''Theogony'', Line 345 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these are geographic: Doris, Rhodea, Europa, Asia. Hesiod explains:&lt;ref&gt;''Theogony'', Line 364ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;For there are three-thousand neat-ankled daughters of Ocean who are dispersed far and wide, and in every place alike serve the earth and the deep waters.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Iliad]] (attributed by the ancient Greeks to [[Homer]]) mentions two Phrygians (the tribe that replaced the [[Luvians]] in Lydia) in the [[Trojan War]] named [[Asius (mythology)|Asios]] (an adjective meaning "Asian");&lt;ref&gt;Μ95, Π717.&lt;/ref&gt; and also a marsh or lowland containing a marsh in Lydia as {{lang|grc|ασιος}}.&lt;ref&gt;Β461.&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of Asia can be seen as the distinct histories of several peripheral coastal regions: East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia and the Middle East, linked by the interior mass of the Central Asian [[steppe]]s.

The coastal periphery was home to some of the world's earliest known civilizations, each of them developing around fertile river valleys. The civilizations in [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Indus Valley]] and the [[Yellow River]] shared many similarities. These civilizations may well have exchanged technologies and ideas such as [[mathematics]] and the wheel. Other innovations, such as writing, seem to have been developed individually in each area. Cities, states and empires developed in these lowlands.

The central steppe region had long been inhabited by horse-mounted nomads who could reach all areas of Asia from the [[steppe]]s. The earliest postulated expansion out of the steppe is that of the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-Europeans]], who spread their languages into the Middle East, South Asia, and the borders of China, where the [[Tocharians]] resided. The northernmost part of Asia, including much of [[Siberia]], was largely inaccessible to the steppe nomads, owing to the dense forests, climate and [[tundra]]. These areas remained very sparsely populated.

The center and the peripheries were mostly kept separated by mountains and deserts. The [[Caucasus]] and [[Himalaya]] mountains and the [[Karakum Desert|Karakum]] and [[Gobi Desert|Gobi]] deserts formed barriers that the steppe horsemen could cross only with difficulty. While the urban city dwellers were more advanced technologically and socially, in many cases they could do little in a military aspect to defend against the mounted hordes of the steppe. However, the lowlands did not have enough open grasslands to support a large horsebound force; for this and other reasons, the [[nomad]]s who conquered states in China, India, and the Middle East often found themselves adapting to the local, more affluent societies.

The Islamic [[Caliphate]]'s defeats of the Byzantine and Persian empires led to West Asia and southern parts of Central Asia and western parts of South Asia under its control during [[Early Muslim conquests|its conquests]] of the 7th century. The [[Mongol Empire]] conquered a large part of Asia in the 13th century, an area extending from China to Europe. Before the Mongol invasion, [[Song dynasty]] reportedly had approximately 120 million citizens; the 1300 census which followed the invasion reported roughly 60 million people.&lt;ref&gt;Ping-ti Ho. "An Estimate of the Total Population of Sung-Chin China", in ''Études Song'', Series 1, No 1, (1970). pp. 33–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Black Death]], one of the most devastating [[pandemic]]s in human history, is thought to have originated in the arid plains of central Asia, where it then travelled along the [[Silk Road]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/middle_ages/blackdisease_01.shtml |title=History – Black Death |publisher=BBC |date=17 February 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120605000815/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/middle_ages/blackdisease_01.shtml |archivedate=5 June 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Russian Empire]] began to expand into Asia from the 17th century, and would eventually take control of all of Siberia and most of Central Asia by the end of the 19th century. The [[Ottoman Empire]] controlled Anatolia, most of the Middle East, North Africa and the Balkans from the mid 16th century onwards. In the 17th century, the [[Manchu people|Manchu]] conquered China and established the [[Qing dynasty]]. The Islamic [[Mughal Empire]] and the Hindu [[Maratha Empire]] controlled much of India in the 16th and 18th centuries respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sen |first1=Sailendra Nath |title=An Advanced History of Modern India |page=11 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=bXWiACEwPR8C&amp;pg=PA1941-IA82&amp;lpg=PA1941-IA82 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011162115/https://books.google.com/books?id=bXWiACEwPR8C&amp;pg=PA1941-IA82&amp;lpg=PA1941-IA82 |archivedate=11 October 2017  |isbn=978-0230328853 |year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asia is the largest continent on Earth. It covers 9% of the Earth's total surface area (or 30% of its land area), and has the largest coastline, at {{convert|62800|km|mi|0}}. Asia is generally defined as comprising the eastern four-fifths of [[Eurasia]]. It is located to the east of the [[Suez Canal]] and the [[Ural Mountains]], and south of the [[Caucasus Mountains]] (or the [[Kuma–Manych Depression]]) and the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] and [[Black Sea]]s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Asia |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110518/Asia |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] Online |year=2006 |location=Chicago |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081118141016/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110518/Asia |archivedate=18 November 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, on the south by the Indian Ocean and on the north by the Arctic Ocean. Asia is subdivided into 48 countries, three of them (Russia, [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Turkey]]) having part of their land in Europe.

Asia has extremely diverse climates and geographic features. Climates range from arctic and subarctic in Siberia to tropical in southern India and Southeast Asia. It is moist across southeast sections, and dry across much of the interior. Some of the largest daily temperature ranges on Earth occur in western sections of Asia. The monsoon circulation dominates across southern and eastern sections, due to the presence of the Himalayas forcing the formation of a thermal low which draws in moisture during the summer. Southwestern sections of the continent are hot. Siberia is one of the coldest places in the Northern Hemisphere, and can act as a source of arctic air masses for North America. The most active place on Earth for tropical cyclone activity lies northeast of the Philippines and south of Japan. The [[Gobi Desert]] is in [[Mongolia]] and the [[Arabian Desert]] stretches across much of the Middle East. The [[Yangtze River]] in China is the longest river in the continent. The [[Himalayas]] between Nepal and China is the tallest mountain range in the world. Tropical rainforests stretch across much of southern Asia and coniferous and deciduous forests lie farther north.

===Climate change===

A survey carried out in 2010 by global risk analysis farm [[Maplecroft]] identified 16 countries that are extremely vulnerable to climate change. Each nation's vulnerability was calculated using 42 socio, economic and environmental indicators, which identified the likely climate change impacts during the next 30 years. The Asian countries of [[Bangladesh]], India, [[Vietnam]], Thailand, Pakistan and [[Sri Lanka]] were among the 16 countries facing extreme risk from climate change. Some shifts are already occurring. For example, in tropical parts of India with a [[semi-arid climate]], the temperature increased by 0.4&amp;nbsp;°C between 1901 and 2003.
A 2013 study by the [[International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics]] ([[ICRISAT]]) aimed to find science-based, pro-poor approaches and techniques that would enable Asia's agricultural systems to cope with climate change, while benefitting poor and vulnerable farmers. The study's recommendations ranged from improving the use of climate information in local planning and strengthening weather-based agro-advisory services, to stimulating diversification of rural household incomes and providing incentives to farmers to adopt natural resource conservation measures to enhance forest cover, replenish groundwater and use [[renewable energy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://exploreit.icrisat.org/sites/default/files/uploads/1378286859_PolicyBrief23.pdf ''Vulnerability to Climate Change: Adaptation Strategies and layers of Resilience''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226173957/http://exploreit.icrisat.org/sites/default/files/uploads/1378286859_PolicyBrief23.pdf |date=26 February 2014 }}, [[ICRISAT]], Policy Brief No. 23, February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Several trade blocs exist, with the most developed being the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]].

Asia is the largest continent in the world by a considerable margin, and it is rich in natural resources, such as petroleum, forests, fish, water, rice, copper and silver. Manufacturing in Asia has traditionally been strongest in East and Southeast Asia, particularly in China, [[Taiwan]], South Korea, Japan, India, the Philippines, and Singapore. Japan and South Korea continue to dominate in the area of [[multinational corporation]]s, but increasingly the PRC and India are making significant inroads. Many companies from Europe, North America, South Korea and Japan have operations in Asia's developing countries to take advantage of its abundant supply of cheap labour and relatively developed infrastructure.

According to [[Citigroup]] 9 of 11 [[3G (countries)|Global Growth Generators]] countries came from Asia driven by population and income growth.

The increased use of outsourcing has assisted the rise of India and the China as financial centers. Due to its large and extremely competitive information technology industry, India has become a major hub for outsourcing.

East Asia had by far the strongest overall [[Human Development Index]] (HDI) improvement of any region in the world, nearly doubling average HDI attainment over the past 40 years, according to the report's analysis of health, education and income data. China, the second highest achiever in the world in terms of HDI improvement since
1970, is the only country on the "Top 10 Movers" list due to income rather than health or education achievements. Its per capita income increased a stunning 21-fold over the last four decades, also lifting hundreds of millions out of income poverty. Yet it was not among the region's top performers in improving school enrollment and life expectancy.&lt;ref name="UNDP"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/PR6-HDR10-RegRBAP-E-rev5-sm.pdf |title=2010 Human Development Report: Asian countries lead development progress over 40 years |publisher=UNDP |accessdate=22 December 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121161015/http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/PR6-HDR10-RegRBAP-E-rev5-sm.pdf |archivedate=21 November 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;[[Nepal]], a South Asian country, emerges as one of the world's fastest movers since 1970 mainly due to health and education achievements.

More than four of every five children of school age in Nepal now attend primary school, compared to just one in five 40 years ago.&lt;ref name="UNDP"/&gt;
&lt;br&gt; Japan and South Korea ranked highest among the countries grouped on the HDI (number 11 and 12 in the world, which are in the "very high human development" category), followed by Hong Kong (21) and Singapore (27). [[Afghanistan]] (155) ranked lowest amongst Asian countries out of the 169 countries assessed.&lt;ref name="UNDP"/&gt;

===Languages===
{{Main|Languages of Asia}}
Asia is home to several [[language family|language families]] and many [[language isolate]]s. Most Asian countries have more than one language that is natively spoken. For instance, according to [[Ethnologue]], more than 600 languages are spoken in Indonesia, more than 800 languages spoken in India, and more than 100 are spoken in the Philippines. China has many languages and dialects in different provinces.

Many of the world's [[major religious groups|major religions]] have their origins in Asia, including the five most practiced in the world (excluding [[irreligion]]), which are Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Chinese folk religion (classified as Confucianism and Taoism), and Buddhism respectively. Asian mythology is complex and diverse. The story of the [[Flood myth|Great Flood]] for example, as presented to Jews in the [[Hebrew Bible]] in the narrative of [[Noah]]—and later to Christians in the [[Old Testament]], and to [[Islam|Muslims]] in the [[Quran]]—is earliest found in [[Mesopotamian mythology]], in the [[Enûma Eliš]] and ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]''. [[Hindu mythology]] similarly tells about an [[avatar]] of [[Vishnu]] in the form of a [[Matsya|fish]] who warned [[Sraddhadeva Manu|Manu]] of a terrible flood. Ancient [[Chinese mythology]] also tells of a [[Great Flood (China)|Great Flood]] spanning generations, one that required the combined efforts of emperors and divinities to control.

====Abrahamic====
The [[Abrahamic religions]] including Judaism, Christianity, Islam and [[Bahá'í Faith]] originated in West Asia.

Judaism, the oldest of the Abrahamic faiths, is practiced primarily in [[Israel]], the [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] homeland and historical birthplace of the [[Jews|Hebrew nation]]: which today consists both of those [[Jews|Israelites]] who remained in [[Mizrahi Jews|Asia/North Africa]] and those who returned from [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora]] in [[Ashkenazi Jews|Europe]], [[American Jews|North America]], and other regions;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/jewpop.html |title=The Jewish Population of the World |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |accessdate=1 June 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621102211/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/jewpop.html |archivedate=21 June 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt; though various diaspora communities persist worldwide.

The [[Hajj]] and [[Umrah]] attract large numbers of Muslim devotees from all over the world to Mecca and Medina. Iran is the largest [[Shi'a]] country.

The [[Bahá'í Faith]] originated in Asia, in Iran (Persia), and spread from there to the Ottoman Empire, Central Asia, India, and Burma during the lifetime of Bahá'u'lláh. Since the middle of the 20th century, growth has particularly occurred in other Asian countries, because Bahá'í activities in many Muslim countries has been severely [[Persecution of Bahá'ís|suppressed]] by authorities.

Almost all Asian religions have philosophical character and Asian philosophical traditions cover a large spectrum of philosophical thoughts and writings. [[Indian philosophy]] includes [[Hindu philosophy]] and [[Buddhist philosophy]]. They include elements of nonmaterial pursuits, whereas another school of thought from India, [[Cārvāka]], preached the enjoyment of the material world. The religions of [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]] originated in India, South Asia. In East Asia, particularly in China and Japan, [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]] and [[Zen|Zen Buddhism]] took shape.

{{as of|2012}}, Hinduism has around 1.1 billion adherents. The faith represents around 25% of Asia's population and is the largest religion in Asia. However, it is mostly concentrated in South Asia. Over 80% of the populations of both India and Nepal adhere to Hinduism, alongside significant communities in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and [[Bali]], Indonesia. Many overseas Indians in countries such as Burma, Singapore and Malaysia also adhere to Hinduism.

Buddhism has a great following in mainland Southeast Asia and East Asia.

In many Chinese communities, Mahayana Buddhism is easily syncretized with Taoism, thus exact religious statistics is difficult to obtain and may be understated or overstated.

The '''boundaries between the continents''' of [[Earth]] are generally a matter of [[geography|geographical]] convention.  Several slightly different conventions are in use.  The number of [[continent]]s is most commonly considered seven but may range as low as four when the [[Americas]] and [[Afro-Eurasia]] are each considered a single continent.  According to the definition of a continent in the strict sense, an [[island]] cannot be part of any continent, but by convention and in practice most major islands are associated with a continent.

There are three overland boundaries subject to definition:

* between [[Europe]] and [[Asia]] (dividing [[Eurasia]]): along the [[Turkish Straits]], the [[Caucasus]] and the [[Urals]] (historically also north of the Caucasus, along the [[Kuma–Manych Depression]] or along the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]])
* between Asia and [[Africa]] (dividing Afro-Eurasia into Africa and [[Eurasia]]): at the [[Isthmus of Suez]]
* between [[North America]] and [[South America]] (dividing the [[Americas]]): the [[Isthmus of Panama]]
While the isthmus between Asia and Africa and that between North and South America are today navigable, via the [[Suez Canal|Suez]] and [[Panama Canal|Panama]] canals, respectively, diversions and canals of human origin generally are not accepted on their own accord as continent-defining boundaries; the  Suez Canal happens to traverse the [[isthmus]] between the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and [[Red Sea]], dividing Asia and Africa. The remaining boundaries concern the association of islands and archipelagos with specific continents, notably:

* the delineation of [[Southeast Asia]] from [[Australasia]] (part of [[Oceania]]) in the [[Ceram Sea]], [[Arafura Sea]], [[Timor Sea]], [[Halmahera Sea]], and [[Malay Archipelago]]
* the delineation between Africa, Europe and Asia in the [[Mediterranean Sea]]
* the delineation between Asia and Europe in the [[Arctic Ocean]]
* the delineation between Europe and North America in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]
* the delineation between North and South America in the [[Caribbean Sea]]
* the delineation of Asia from North America in the [[North Pacific Ocean]]

==Europe and Africa==
[[File:Mediterranean Relief.jpg|left|thumb|300x300px|The Mediterranean sea, between Africa &amp; Europe]]
[[File:Makaronesia.jpg|thumb|300x300px|The Atlantic Ocean around the boundary]]
The [[Europea]]n and [[Africa]]n mainlands are non-contiguous, and the delineation between these continents is thus merely a question of which islands are to be associated with which continent. At its nearest point, [[Morocco]] and the European portion of [[Spain]] are separated by only {{convert|8.1|mi|0|abbr=off|order=flip}}.

The Portuguese Atlantic island possession of the [[Azores]] is {{convert|1368|km|abbr=on}} from Europe and {{convert|1507|km|abbr=on}} from Africa, and is usually grouped with Europe if grouped with any continent. By contrast, the [[Canary Islands|Canary]] and [[Madeira]] islands off the Atlantic coast of [[Morocco]] are much closer to, and usually grouped with, Africa (the Canary Islands are only {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} from the African coast at their closest point, while Madeira is {{convert|520|km|abbr=on}} from Africa and {{convert|1,000|km|abbr=on}} from Europe).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spainforvisitors.com/sections/canaryislands.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=15 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121225123213/http://spainforvisitors.com/sections/canaryislands.htm |archivedate=25 December 2012 }}; {{cite web|url=http://listofafricancountries.com |title=Countries of Africa |accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mediterranean island nation of [[Malta]] is approximately {{convert|81|km|abbr=on}} from the coast of Sicily in Europe - much closer than the {{convert|288|km|abbr=on}} distance to the closest African coast.  The nearby Italian island of [[Lampedusa]] is {{convert|207|km|abbr=on}} from Sicily while just {{convert|127|km|abbr=on}} from the African coast;  similarly, [[Pantelleria]] is {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} from Sicily and just {{convert|71|km|abbr=on}} from the African coast.  All of these Mediterranean islands are actually located on the [[African Plate|African plate]], and may be considered part of the continent of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://africa-arabia-plate.weebly.com/|title=African/Arabian Tectonic Plates|website=African/Arabian Tectonic Plates|access-date=2016-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/GeolColBk/AfricanPlate.HTM|title=African Plate|website=www.uwgb.edu|access-date=2016-10-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006145431/https://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/GeolColBk/AfricanPlate.HTM#|archive-date=6 October 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for political and historical reasons, maps generally display them as part of Europe.

==Europe and Asia==
The boundary between Europe and Asia is unusual among continental boundaries because of its largely mountain-and-river-based characteristics north and east of the Black Sea. The reason is historical, the division of Europe and Asia going back to the early [[Greek geographers]].
In the modern sense of the term "continent", [[Eurasia]] is more readily identifiable as a "continent", and Europe has occasionally been described as a [[subcontinent]] of Eurasia.&lt;ref name="europe"&gt;{{cite book |author=Hans Slomp |title=Europe: A Political Profile |year=2011 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LmfAPmwE6YYC&amp;pg=PA634&amp;lpg=PA634&amp;dq=%22european+subcontinent%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SYCYoz-m3V&amp;sig=zCy9OfV_frpcoJH0acUWF8JGX3c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=GWUNVKlrx9qgBPmZgbAM&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwCw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22european%20subcontinent%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=2014-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
[[File:Historical Europe-Asia boundaries 1700 to 1900.png|thumb|upright|Conventions used for the boundary between Europe and Asia during the 18th and 19th centuries. The red line shows the most common modern convention, in use since {{circa|1850}} (see [[#Modern definition|below]]).

The threefold division of the [[Old World]] into Europe, Asia and Africa has been in use since the 6th century BC, due to [[Greek geographers]] such as [[Anaximander]] and [[Hecataeus of Miletus|Hecataeus]]. 

Anaximander placed the boundary between Asia and Europe along the [[Phasis River]] (the modern Rioni) in the Caucasus (from its mouth by [[Poti]] on the [[Black Sea]] coast, through the [[Surami Pass]] and along the [[Kura (Caspian Sea)|Kura River]] to the Caspian Sea), a convention still followed by [[Herodotus]] in the 5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' 4.38. C.f. James Rennell, ''The Geographical System of Herodotus Examined and Explained'', Volume 1, Rivington 1830, [https://books.google.com/books?id=enQ-AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA244&amp;dq=Herodotus+Phasis&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=g8qiTbXZNtCVOuPjjDU&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Herodotus%20Phasis&amp;f=false p. 244]&lt;/ref&gt;
As geographic knowledge of the Greeks increased during the [[Hellenistic period]],&lt;ref&gt;according to Strabo (''[[Geographica]]'' 11.7.4) even at the time of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]], "it was agreed by all that the Tanais river separated Asia from Europe" ({{lang|grc|ὡμολόγητο ἐκ πάντων ὅτι διείργει τὴν Ἀσίαν ἀπὸ
τῆς Εὐρώπης ὁ Τάναϊς ποταμός}}; c.f. Duane W. Roller, ''Eratosthenes' Geography'', Princeton University Press, 2010, {{ISBN|978-0-691-14267-8}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8peKyWK_SWsC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=Eratosthenes+Tanais&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=vdGiTeTEEY7rObCruTU&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Eratosthenes%20Tanais&amp;f=false p. 57])
&lt;/ref&gt; this archaic convention was revised, and the boundary between Europe and Asia was now considered to be the [[Don River (Russia)|Tanais]] (the modern Don River). This is the convention used by Roman era authors such as [[Posidonius]],&lt;ref&gt;
W. Theiler, ''Posidonios. Die Fragmente'', vol. 1. Berlin: De Gruyter, 1982, fragm. 47a.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Strabo]]&lt;ref&gt;

Kidd (ed.), ''Posidonius: The commentary'', Cambridge University Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-521-60443-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_iXs1aCr1ckC&amp;pg=PA738&amp;dq=Posidonius+Tanais&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=E8-iTdzLH8aZOuXPuTQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Tanais&amp;f=false p. 738].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ptolemy]].&lt;ref&gt;
''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geographia]]'' 7.5.6 (ed. Nobbe 1845, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vHMCAAAAQAAJ vol. 2], p. 178)) {{lang|grc|Καὶ τῇ Εὐρώπῃ δὲ συνάπτει διὰ τοῦ μεταξὺ αὐχένος τῆς τε Μαιώτιδος λίμνης καὶ τοῦ Σαρματικοῦ Ὠκεανοῦ ἐπὶ τῆς διαβάσεως τοῦ Τανάϊδος ποταμοῦ. }}
"And [Asia] is connected to Europe by the land-strait between Lake Maiotis and the Sarmatian Ocean where the river Tanais crosses through."&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the Middle Ages and into the 18th century, the traditional division of the landmass of [[Eurasia]] into two continents, Europe and Asia, followed Ptolemy, with the boundary following the [[Turkish Straits]], the [[Black Sea]], the [[Kerch Strait]],  the [[Sea of Azov]] and the [[Don River (Russia)|Don]] (known in antiquity as the Tanais). But maps produced during the 16th to 18th centuries tended to differ in how to continue the boundary beyond the Don bend at [[Kalach-na-Donu]] (where it is closest to the Volga, now joined with it by the [[Volga–Don Canal]]), into territory not described in any detail by the ancient geographers.

[[Philip Johan von Strahlenberg]] in 1725 was the first to depart from the classical Don boundary by drawing the line along the [[Volga River|Volga]], following the Volga north until the [[Samara Bend]], along [[Obshchy Syrt]] (the [[drainage divide]] between Volga and [[Ural River|Ural]]) and then north along [[Ural Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Das Nord-und Ostliche Theil von Europa und Asia|author=Philipp Johann von Strahlenberg|year=1730|language=German|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oren-icn.ru"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oren-icn.ru/index.php/discussmenu/retrospectiva/685-eagraniza |title=Boundary of Europe and Asia along Urals |language=Russian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130417143618/http://oren-icn.ru/index.php/discussmenu/retrospectiva/685-eagraniza |archivedate=17 April 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mapmakers continued to differ on the boundary between the lower Don and Samara well into the 19th century. The [[:commons:Category:Atlas of Russian Empire. 1745 year|1745 atlas]] published by the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] has the boundary follow the Don beyond Kalach as far as [[Serafimovich (town)|Serafimovich]] before cutting north towards [[Arkhangelsk]], while other 18th- to 19th-century mapmakers such as [[John Cary]] followed Strahlenberg's prescription. To the south, the [[Kuma–Manych Depression]] was identified circa 1773 by a German naturalist, [[Peter Simon Pallas]], as a valley that, once upon a time, connected the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea,&lt;ref name="oren-icn.ru" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Simon Pallas, ''Journey through various provinces of the Russian Empire'', vol. 3 (1773)&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently was proposed as a natural boundary between continents.

By the mid-19th century, there were three main conventions, one following the Don, the [[Volga–Don Canal]] and the Volga, the other following the Kuma–Manych Depression to the Caspian and then the Ural River, and the third abandoning the Don altogether, following the [[Greater Caucasus watershed]] to the Caspian. The question was still treated as a controversy in geographical literature of the 1860s, with [[Douglas Freshfield]] advocating the Caucasus crest boundary as the best possible, citing support from various modern geographers.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas W. Freshfield, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=ips8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=%22watershed+of+the+Caucasus%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=4bCdTeaeEpDsOeK6iOgE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22watershed%20of%20the%20Caucasus%22&amp;f=false Journey in the Caucasus]", ''Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society'', Volumes 13-14, 1869.

In [[Russia]] and the [[Soviet Union]], the boundary along the Kuma–Manych Depression was the most commonly used as early as 1906.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dlib.rsl.ru/view.php?path=/rsl01004000000/rsl01004103000/rsl01004103489/rsl01004103489.pdf#?page=163 "Europe"]{{dead link|date=August 2016}}, ''[[Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary]]'', 1906&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, the Soviet Geographical Society formally recommended that the boundary between the Europe and Asia be drawn in textbooks from [[Baydaratskaya Bay]], on the [[Kara Sea]], along the eastern foot of Ural Mountains, then following the [[Ural River]] until the [[Mugodzhar Hills]], and then the [[Emba River]]; and Kuma–Manych Depression,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://velikijporog.narod.ru/st_evraz_gran.htm|title=Do we live in Europe or in Asia?|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus placing the Caucasus entirely in Asia and the Urals entirely in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.i-u.ru/biblio/archive/orlenok_fisicheskaja/06.aspx |title=Physical Geography |year=1998 |author=Orlenok V. |language=Russian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016212930/http://www.i-u.ru/biblio/archive/orlenok_fisicheskaja/06.aspx |archivedate=16 October 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most geographers in the Soviet Union favoured the boundary along the Caucasus crest&lt;ref&gt;E. M. Moores, R. W. Fairbridge, ''Encyclopedia of European and Asian regional geology'', Springer, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-412-74040-4}}, p. 34: "most Soviet geographers took the watershed of the Main Range of the Greater Caucasus as the boundary between Europe and Asia."&lt;/ref&gt; and this became the standard convention in the latter 20th century, although the Kuma–Manych boundary remained in use in some 20th-century maps.

The modern border between Asia and Europe remains a historical and cultural construct, defined only by convention. The modern border follows the [[Aegean Sea]], the [[Dardanelles]]-[[Sea of Marmara]]-[[Bosphorus]] (together known as the [[Turkish Straits]]), the [[Black Sea]], along the [[Drainage divide|watershed]] of the [[Greater Caucasus]], the northwestern portion of the [[Caspian Sea]] and along the [[Ural River]] and [[Ural Mountains]] to the [[Kara Sea]], as mapped and listed in most atlases including that of the [[National Geographic Society]] and as described in the [[World Factbook]].&lt;ref name="NatlGeoAtlas"&gt;{{Cite book|title=National Geographic Atlas of the World|edition=9th|year=2011|location=Washington, DC|publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]|isbn=978-1-4262-0634-4}} "Europe" (plate 59); "Asia" (plate 74): "A commonly accepted division between Asia and Europe ... is formed by the Ural Mountains, Ural River, Caspian Sea, Caucasus Mountains, and the Black Sea with its outlets, the Bosporus and Dardanelles."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Factbook"&gt;{{Cite book|title=World Factbook | url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/aj.html |location=Washington, DC|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this definition, [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Azerbaijan]] both have most of their territory in Asia, although each has small parts of their northern borderlands north of the Greater Caucasus watershed and thus in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=World Factbook | url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/aj.html |location=Washington, DC |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency}} Azerbaijan: Geography and Georgia: Geography&lt;/ref&gt;

Though most geographic sources assign the area south of the Caucasus Mountain crest to [[Southwest Asia|Southwest or West Asia]],&lt;ref name="Asia"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/100270/Caucasus |title=Caucasus |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Britannica |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; no definition is entirely satisfactory, with it often becoming a matter of self-identification. Cultural influences in the area originate from both Asia and Europe. While geographers rarely define continents primarily politically, [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and to a lesser extent [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]] are increasingly in the 21st century politically oriented towards Europe, but Armenia has a great cultural diaspora to the south, and Azerbaijan shares a cultural affinity with [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Iranian Azerbaijan]] as well as with the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] countries of [[Central Asia]].&lt;ref name="De Waal"&gt;Thomas De Waal.

The Turkish city [[Istanbul]] lies in on both sides of the Bosporus (one of the Turkish Straits), making it a transcontinental city. [[Russia]] and [[Turkey]] are transcontinental countries with territory in both Europe and Asia by any definition except that of Eurasia as a single continent. While Russia is historically a European country with a history of [[Russian Empire|imperial conquests]] in Asia, the situation for Turkey is inverse, as that of an Asian country with [[Ottoman Empire|imperial conquests]] in Europe. [[Kazakhstan]] is also a transcontinental country by this definition, its [[West Kazakhstan Province|West Kazakhstan]] and [[Atyrau Province|Atyrau]] provinces extending on either side of the Ural River.&lt;ref name="Factbook-Ural"&gt;{{Cite book | title=World Factbook | url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/kz.html |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]}} Kazakhstan: Geography&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kuma–Manych Depression]] (more precisely, the [[Manych River]], the [[Kuma–Manych Canal]] and the [[Kuma River (Russia)|Kuma River]]) remains cited less commonly as one possible natural boundary in contemporary sources.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]'' (2011) s.v. [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/324715/Kuma-Manych-Depression "Kuma-Manych Depression"]: "It is often regarded as the natural boundary between Europe and Asia."&lt;/ref&gt; This definition peaked in prominence in the 19th century, however it has declined in usage since then, as it places traditionally European areas of Russia such as  [[Stavropol]], [[Krasnodar]], and even areas just south of [[Rostov-on-Don]] in Asia.

A lesser known definition for country grouping, is the definition used for statistical purposes by the [[United Nations Statistics Division]] (UNSD):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm| title=Composition of macro geographical (continental) regions, geographical sub-regions, and selected economic and other groupings| publisher=United Nations Statistics Division}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* listed as part of [[Eastern Europe]]: [[Russian Federation]]
* listed as part of [[Central Asia]]: [[Kazakhstan]]
* listed as part of [[Western Asia]]: [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Cyprus]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], and [[Turkey]]
 
According to UNSD, the aforementioned "assignment of countries or areas to specific groupings is for statistical convenience and does not imply any assumption regarding political or other affiliation of countries or territories".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49.htm |title=Standard country or area codes and geographical regions for statistical use |publisher=Unstats.un.org |date= |accessdate=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the UNSD classification often differs from those of other [[United Nations]] organizations. For instance, while UNSD includes Georgia and Cyprus in Western Asia, the [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]]  and [[UNESCO]] include both countries in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FAKMBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=west+asia+iran+2015&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cWGRVanpKqOy7Qb1tqP4Bw&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=west%20asia%20iran%202015&amp;f=false United Nations Industrial Organisation] p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO, [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/unesco/worldwide/unesco-regions/europe-and-north-america/ Europe and North America], Retrieved: 10 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islands===
[[Cyprus]] is an island of the Mediterranean located close to [[Asia Minor]], so that it is usually associated with Asia and/or the [[Middle East]], as in the [[World Factbook]] and the [[United Nations geoscheme]], but the [[Republic of Cyprus]] was nevertheless admitted to the Council of Europe in 1961 and joined the EU in 2004.  The northern part of the island functions as the unrecognized (except by Turkey) [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]].

The Greek [[Aegean Islands|North Aegean Islands]] and the [[Dodecanese]] lie on the coast of the Asian part of Turkey (on the Asian continental shelf).

==Europe and North America==
Europe and North America are separated by the [[North Atlantic]].
In terms of associating islands with either continent, the boundary is usually drawn between [[Greenland]] and [[Iceland]]. The Norwegian islands of [[Jan Mayen]] and [[Svalbard]] in the [[Arctic Ocean]] are usually associated with Europe. Iceland and the [[Azores]] are protrusions of the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]] and are associated with and peopled from Europe, even though they have areas on the [[North American Plate]].  (Definitions of "continents" are a physical and [[cultural construct]] dating back centuries, long before the advent or even knowledge of [[plate tectonics]]; thus, defining a "continent" falls into the realm of physical and cultural geography, while continental plate definitions fall under plate tectonics in the realm of [[geologists|geology]].)

===Islands===
The geographical notion of a [[continent]] stands in opposition to islands and archipelagos.&lt;ref&gt;
See [[:continent#Noun|continent]] on [[Wiktionary]]. "from Latin ''continent-, continens'' 'continuous mass of land, mainland'" (http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/continent?show=1&amp;t=1301917145 merriam-webster.com])&lt;/ref&gt;
Nevertheless, there are some islands that are considered part of Europe in a political sense.
This most notably includes the [[British Isles]] (part of the European continental shelf and during the Ice Age of the continent itself), besides the islands of the [[North Sea]], the [[Baltic Sea]] and the [[Mediterranean]] which are part of the territory of a country situated on the European mainland, and usually also the [[island state]]s of [[Iceland]] and [[Malta]].

Russia's [[Vaygach Island]] and [[Novaya Zemlya]] extend northward from the northern end of the [[Ural Mountains]] and are a continuation of that chain into the [[Arctic Ocean]]. While Novaya Zemlya was variously grouped with Europe or with Asia in 19th-century maps it is now usually grouped with Europe, the continental boundary considered to join the Arctic Ocean along the southern shore of the [[Kara Sea]]. The Russian Arctic [[archipelago]] of [[Franz Josef Land]] farther north is also associated with Europe.

Europe ends in the west at the [[Atlantic Ocean]], although Iceland and the [[Azores]] archipelago (in the Atlantic, between Europe and North America) are usually considered European, as is the Norwegian [[Svalbard]] archipelago in the [[Arctic Ocean]]. [[Greenland]] is geographically part of North America, but politically associated with Europe as it is part of the [[Kingdom of Denmark]], although it has extensive home rule and EU law no longer applies there.

==Africa and Asia==

Historically in [[Greco-Roman geography]], "Africa" meant [[Ancient Libya]], and its eastern extent was taken to be around [[Marmarica]], at the ''[[Catabathmus Magnus]]'', placing [[ancient Egypt|Egypt]] in Asia entirely.
The idea of Egypt being an "African" country seems to develop in around the mid-19th century;{{CN|date=August 2016}} the term  ''Africa'' was classically reserved for what is now known as the [[Maghreb]], to the explicit exclusion of Egypt, but with the [[exploration of Africa]] the shape of the African landmass (and Egypt's "natural" inclusion in that landmass) became apparent.  In 1806, [[William George Browne]] still titled his travelogue ''Travels in Africa, Egypt, and Syria''. Similarly, [[James Bruce]] in 1835 published ''Travels through part of Africa, Syria, Egypt, and Arabia''. On the other hand,
as early as 1670  [[John Ogilby]] under the title ''Africa'' published ''"an accurate Description of the Regions of Egypt, Barbary, Libya, and Billedulgerid, the Land of Negroes, Guinea, Æthiopia, and the Abyssines, with all the adjacent Islands, either in the Mediterranean, Atlantic, Southern, or Oriental Seas, belonging thereunto"''.

The usual line taken to divide Africa from Asia today is at the [[Isthmus of Suez]], the narrowest gap between the [[Mediterranean]] and [[Gulf of Suez]], the route today followed by the [[Suez Canal]]. This makes the [[Sinai Peninsula]] geographically Asian, and [[Egypt]] a transcontinental country. Less than 2% of Egyptian population live in the Sinai, and hence Egypt, even though technically transcontinental, is usually considered an [[African country]] entirely and not partly Asian.

But when discussing the geopolitical region of the [[MENA|Middle East and North Africa]], Egypt is usually grouped with the Western Asian countries as part of the [[Middle East]], while Egypt's western neighbor [[Libya]] is grouped with the remaining North African countries as the [[Maghreb]]. However, they are both members of the [[Arab League]] as well as the [[African Union]].

The [[Seychelles]], [[Mauritius]], and [[Comoros]] are island nations in the [[Indian Ocean]] associated with Africa. The island of [[Socotra]] may be considered African as it lies on this continent's shelf, but is part of [[Yemen]], an Asian country.

==North and South America==
[[File:Countries-Panama-provinces-2005-10-18-en.png|thumb|225px|right|Panama with the Panama Canal.]]
{{Further|Americas|Central America}}

===Mainland===
The border between North America and South America is at some point on the [[Isthmus of Panama]]. The most common demarcation in atlases and other sources follows the [[Serranía del Darién|Darién Mountains]] watershed divide along the [[Colombia]]-Panama [[Colombia–Panama border|border]] where the isthmus meets the South American continent.  Virtually all atlases list Panama as a state falling entirely within [[North America]] and/or [[Central America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.nationalgeographic.com/education/mapping/outline-map/?map=Panama |title=National Geographic Education |publisher=[[National Geographic Society]] |accessdate=2011-05-12 }}&lt;br&gt;{{Cite book|title=National Geographic Atlas (list)|publisher=National Geographic Society|year=2010|page=4}}&lt;br&gt;{{Cite book|title=Webster's New Geographical Dictionary (list and map)|publisher=Merriam-Webster Inc.|year=1984|pages=856, 859}}&lt;br&gt;[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm#americas "Americas"] ''Standard Country and Area Codes Classifications (M49)'', United Nations Statistics Division&lt;br&gt;[http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/reference/international/north_america/referencemap_image_view "North America"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303000000/http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/reference/international/north_america/referencemap_image_view |date=3 March 2008 }} ''Atlas of Canada''&lt;br&gt;[http://www.nationalgeographic.com/xpeditions/atlas/index.html?Parent=nameri&amp;Rootmap=&amp;Mode=d&amp;SubMode=w North America Atlas] National Geographic&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islands===
Often most of the [[Caribbean islands]] are considered part of North America, but [[Aruba]], [[Bonaire]], [[Curaçao]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]] lie on the [[continental shelf]] of South America. On the other hand, the Venezuelan [[Isla Aves]] and the Colombian [[San Andrés and Providencia]] lie on the North American shelf.

==Asia and North America==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2011}}
The [[Bering Strait]] and [[Bering Sea]] separate the landmasses of Asia and North America, as well as forming the international boundary between Russia and the United States. This national and continental boundary separates the [[Diomede Islands]] in the Bering Strait, with Big Diomede in Russia and Little Diomede in the US. The [[Aleutian Islands]] are an island chain extending westward from the [[Alaska Peninsula]] toward Russia's [[Komandorski Islands]] and [[Kamchatka Peninsula]]. Most of them are always associated with North America, except for the westernmost [[Near Islands]] group, which is on Asia's continental shelf beyond the [[North Aleutians Basin]] and on rare occasions could be associated with Asia, which could then allow the U.S. state of [[Alaska]] to be considered a transcontinental state.

[[St. Lawrence Island]] in the northern Bering Sea belongs to Alaska and may be associated with either continent but is almost always considered part of North America, as with the [[Rat Islands]] in the Aleutian chain. At their nearest points, [[Alaska]] and [[Russia]] are separated by only {{convert|2.5|mi|0|order=flip|abbr=off}}.

==The Americas and Oceania==
The [[Galápagos Islands]] and [[Malpelo Island]] in the eastern Pacific Ocean are possessions of [[Ecuador]] and [[Colombia]], respectively, and associated with South America. The uninhabited French possession of [[Clipperton Island]] {{convert|600|mi|sigfig=1|order=flip|abbr=off}} off the Mexican coast is associated with North America.

[[Easter Island]], a territory of [[Chile]], is considered to be in Oceania, though politically it is associated with South America.

The United States of America controls numerous territories in Oceania, including the state of [[Hawaii]] and the territories of [[Guam]], the [[Northern Mariana Islands]] and [[American Samoa]].

==Asia and Oceania==
[[File:Map of Sunda and Sahul.png|thumb|right|300px|[[Wallace Line|Wallace]], [[Lydekker line|Lydekker]] and [[Max Carl Wilhelm Weber|Weber]] Lines, the principals on [[Wallacea]] ]]
The [[Malay Archipelago]] is usually divided between Asia and [[Australasia]], most commonly along the anthropologic Melanesian line or [[Max Carl Wilhelm Weber|Weber's Line]]. Indonesia controls the western half of [[New Guinea]], geographically part of Australasia. The eastern half of the island is part of [[Papua New Guinea]] which is considered to be part of Oceania. Indonesia is  commonly referred to as one of the [[Asia#SouthEast Asia|Southeast Asian]] countries. [[East Timor]], an independent state that was formerly a territory of Indonesia, which is geographically part of Asia, is classified by the [[United Nations]] as part of the "South-Eastern Asia" block. It is [[ASEAN Summit#East Timor|expected to join]] the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/east-timor-asean-bid/2006/07/22/1153166635002.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=East Timor ASEAN bid | date=23 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; having been involved as an ASEAN Regional Forum member since independence, and has participated in the [[Southeast Asian Games]] since [[2003 Southeast Asian Games|2003]]. Occasionally, all of the [[Malay Archipelago]] is included in Oceania, although this is extremely rare, especially as most of the archipelago lies on the Asian continental shelf.

The [[Commonwealth of Australia]] includes [[List of islands of Australia#External Territories|island possessions in Oceania]] and islands closer to Indonesia than the Australian mainland.

==Antarctica==
Antarctica along with its outlying islands have no permanent population. All land claims south of 60°S latitude are held in abeyance by the [[Antarctic Treaty System]].

The [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]] are closer to Antarctica than to any other continent. However, they are politically associated with the inhabited [[Falkland Islands]] which are closer to South America. Furthermore, Argentina, a South American country, maintains its [[irredentism|irredentist]] claims on the islands. The continental shelf boundary separates the two island groups.

The [[Prince Edward Islands]] are located between Africa and Antarctica, and are the territory of South Africa, an African country.  The Australian [[Macquarie Island]] and the New Zealand [[Antipodes Islands]], [[Auckland Islands]], and [[Campbell Island group|Campbell Islands]], are all located between the [[Oceania]]n countries of Australia and New Zealand and Antarctica.&lt;!-- see [[Talk:Transcontinental country#New Zealand|discussion]] --&gt;

Australia's [[Heard Island and McDonald Islands]] and the French [[Kerguelen Islands]] are located on the [[Kerguelen Plateau]], on the Antarctic continental plate. The French [[Crozet Islands]], [[Île Amsterdam]], [[Île Saint-Paul]], and the Norwegian [[Bouvet Island]] are also located on the Antarctic continental plate, and are not often associated with other continents.

===Global Health Archive===
'''''Global Health Archive''''' is a searchable database produced by CABI. It is created from 800,000 records, from six printed abstract journals,  which are collected published scientific research from 1910 to 1972, digitized to form the archive. Global Health Archive is also  indexed in other databases, which also serve as access points. These other databases are ''CAB Direct'', [[Web of Knowledge]], [[EBSCOhost]], [[Ovid Technologies|OvidSP]], and [[Dialog (online database)|Dialog]].&lt;ref name=ghArchive/&gt;

When combined with the ''Global Health'' database indexing coverage can be from 1910 to present day. Hence, coverage is made up of past [[epidemics]], from rates and patterns of disease [[Transmission (medicine)|transmission]], duration of [[pandemics]], timing of epidemiological peaks, [[geographic distribution]] of diseases, and [[World Health Organization|government preparedness]] and [[quarantine]] provisions.  The following can also be taken  into account:  effects on different age and [[social groups]], severity in developing vs. developed countries, [[symptoms]], causes of [[Human|mortality]] - such as secondary problems like [[pneumonia]] - and mortality rates.&lt;ref name=ghArchive&gt;{{cite web

==CABI full text repository==
'''''CABI full text repository''''' is integrated into all ''CABI databases'' including CAB Abstracts, and Global Health. Both of these are online and print journals. Coverage includes 70,000 full text articles, through agreements with third party publishers. Eighty percent of the content is exclusive to CABI.&lt;ref name=full-text/&gt;  

The full text repository is made up of fifty percent journal articles, and equal percentage of conference (proceeding) papers, and other accessible literature is also included. Eighty percent of the articles are in English and coverage includes 56 countries. Also included in this database are relevant but hard to find materials which crosses disciplines consisting of [[agriculture]], [[health sciences|health]] and the [[life sciences]]. Mainstream literature and hard to find materials of equal relevance are given equal access.&lt;ref name=full-text&gt;{{cite web

{{Democracy}}Criticism of [[democracy]] is grounded in democracy's contested definition—its purpose, process, and outcomes. Since [[Classical antiquity]] and through the modern era, democracy has been associated with "rule of the people," "rule of the majority," and free selection or election either through direct participation or elected representation respectively, but has not been linked to a particular outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/democracy|title=Democracy – Definition of Democracy by Merriam-Webster|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political thinkers approach their critique of democracy from different perspectives. Many do not necessarily oppose democracy—"rule of the people"—but, rather, seek to expand or question its popular definition. In their work, they distinguish between democratic principles that are effectively implemented through undemocratic procedures; undemocratic principles that are implemented through democratic procedures; and variations of the same kind.

For instance, some critics of democracy would agree with [[Winston Churchill]]'s famous remark, "No one pretends that democracy is perfect or all-wise. Indeed, it has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time."&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1947/nov/11/parliament-bill#column_206|title=Parliament Bill|last=|first=|date=11 November 1947|website=api.parliament.uk|language=English|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; While others, may be more prepared to describe existing democratic regimes as anything but "rule of the people."

Critics of democracy have tried to highlight democracy's inconsistencies, paradoxes, and limits by contrasting it with other forms of governments. They have characterized most modern democracies as democratic [[Polyarchy|polyarchies]]&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Polyarchy: Participation and Opposition|last=Dahl|first=Robert A.|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1972|isbn=0300015658|location=New Haven|pages=1–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and democratic [[Aristocracy|aristocracies]];&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Principles of Representative Government|last=Manin|first=Bernard|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1997|isbn=0521458919|location=Cambridge|pages=2, 67–93, 132–160}}&lt;/ref&gt; they have identified [[Fascism|fascist]] moments in modern democracies; they have termed the societies produced by modern democracies as [[Neo-feudalism|neo-feudal]];&lt;ref&gt;Thom Hartmann, "[http://www.commondreams.org/views/2002/11/06/time-remove-bananas-and-return-our-republic-democracy Time to Remove the Bananas...and Return Our Republic to Democracy]", ''CommonDreams.org'', 6 November 2002&lt;/ref&gt; while, yet others, have contrasted democracy with [[Nazism]], [[anarcho-capitalism]], [[theocracy]], and [[absolute monarchy]].

The most widely known critics of democracy include [[Plato]] and [[The Federalist Papers|the authors of the Federalist Papers]], who were interested in establishing a [[representative democracy]] in America instead of a [[direct democracy]].

Additional historical figures associated with the critique of democracy thought include [[Aristotle]], [[Montesquieu]], [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Hubert Lagardelle]], [[Charles Maurras]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Carl Schmitt]], [[Oswald Spengler]], [[Nicolás Gómez Dávila]], and [[Elazar Menachem Shach]].

Leading contemporary thinkers in critical democratic theory include [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[Robert A. Dahl]], [[Robert E. Goodin]], [[Bernard Manin]], [[Joseph Schumpeter]], [[James S. Fishkin]], [[Ian Shapiro]], [[Jason Brennan]], [[Hélène Landemore]] and [[Hans-Hermann Hoppe]].

==Criticism of democracy's purpose==

===Benefits of a specialized society===
One such argument is that the benefits of a specialized society may be compromised by democracy. As ordinary citizens are encouraged to take part in the political life of the country, they have the power to directly influence the outcome of government policies through the democratic procedures of voting, campaigning and the use of press. The result is that government policies may be more influenced by non-specialist opinions and thereby the effectiveness compromised, especially if a policy is very technically sophisticated and/or the general public inadequately informed. For example, there is no guarantee that those who campaign about the government's economic policies are themselves professional economists or academically competent in this particular discipline, regardless of whether they were well-educated. Essentially this means that a democratic government may not be providing the most good for the largest number of people. However, some have argued that this should not even be the goal of democracies because the minority could be seriously mistreated under that purported goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Kenneth J. |last1=Arrow |first2=Robert C. |last2=Lind |date=June 1970  |title=Uncertainty and the Evaluation of Public Investment Decisions|journal=The American Economic Review|volume=60|issue=3 |pages=364–378 |id= |jstor=1817987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rule of the aristocratic ===

====Nietzsche====

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]], as an opponent of [[Christianity]], saw western democracy as connected to it, claiming that "the ''democratic'' movement is Christianity's heir" and denounced the democratic man for being inherently unable to "feel any shame for being unable to rise above" his desire "to satisfy a host of petty wants through the calculation of long-term self-interest".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cooperative-individualism.org/nietzsche-friedrich_inevitability-of-democracy-1886.htm|title=Friedrich Nietzsche / The Inevitabilty of Democracy -- 1886|website=www.cooperative-individualism.org|access-date=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=June 2018}} Nietzsche claimed that in a democracy "[w]hen the individual's highest and strongest instincts break forth with a passion, driving him far and above the average, beyond the lowlands of the herd conscience", "the moral perspective now considers how harmful or harmless an opinion, an emotional state, a will, a talent is to the community, to equality". "Exalted, self-directed spirituality, a will to solitude, even great powers of reason are felt as a danger". "Morality in Europe today is herd animal morality".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beyond Good and Evil / On the Genealogy of Morals|last=Nietzche|first=Friedrich|publisher=Clap Publishing, LLC|year=2018|isbn=1635378443|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Manin ====
&lt;blockquote href="The Republic (Plato)"&gt;The real difference between ancient democracies and modern republics lies, according to Madison, in "''the total exclusion of the people in their collective capacity'' from any share in the ''latter'', and not in the ''total exclusion of the representatives of the people'' from the administration of the ''former''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;— [[Bernard Manin]], p. 2 (See: Madison, "Federalist 63," in ''[[The Federalist Papers]],'' p. 387; Madison's emphasis.)&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Bernard Manin]] is interested in distinguishing modern representative [[republic]]s, such as the United States, from ancient direct [[Democracy|democracies]], such as Athens.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; Manin believes that both aspire to "rule of the people," but that the nature of modern representative republics lends them to "rule of the aristocratic." Manin explains that in ancient democracies, virtually every citizen had the chance to be selected to populate the government but in modern republics, only elites have the chance of being elected. He does not defend this phenomenon but rather seeks to describe it.

Manin draws from [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]], [[Montesquieu]], and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] to suggest that the dominant form of government, representative as opposed to direct, is effectively aristocratic.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; He proposes that modern representative governments exercise political power through aristocratic elections which, in turn, brings into question democracy's "rule of the people" principle. As far as Montesquieu is concerned, elections favor the "best" citizens who Manin notes tend to be wealthy and upper-class. As far as Rousseau is concerned, elections favor the incumbent government officials or the citizens with the strongest personalities, which results in hereditary aristocracy. Manin further evinces the aristocratic nature of representative governments by contrasting them with the ancient style of selection by lot. Manin notes that [[Montesquieu]] believed that lotteries prevent jealousy and distribute offices equally (among citizens from different ranks), while [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] believed that lotteries choose indifferently, preventing self-interest and partiality from polluting the citizen's choice (and thus prevent hereditary aristocracy).

However, Manin also provides criticism of direct democracy, or selection by lot.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; Manin reflects on Montesquieu's interrogation of the extent to which [[Athenian democracy|Athenian direct democracy]] was truly direct. Montesquieu finds that citizens who had reason to believe they would be accused as "unworthy of selection" commonly withheld their names from the lottery, thereby making selection by lot vulnerable to self-selection bias and, thus, aristocratic in nature. Manin does not dwell on direct democracy's potentially aristocratic elements, perhaps because he share's Montesquieu's belief that there is nothing alarming about the exclusion of citizens who may be incompetent; this exclusion may be inevitable in any method of selection.

Additionally, Manin is interested in explaining the discrepancy between 18th century American and French revolutionaries' ''declaration'' of the "equality of all citizens" and their ''enactment'' of (aristocratic) elections in their respective democratic experiments.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; Manin suggests that the discrepancy is explained by the revolutionaries' contemporary preoccupation with one form of equality over another. The revolutionaries prioritized gaining the equal right to consent to their choice of government (even a potentially aristocratic democracy), at the expense of seeking the equal right to be face of that democracy. And it is elections, not lots, that provide citizens with more opportunities to consent. In elections, citizens consent both to the procedure of elections and to the product of the elections (even if they produce the election of elites). In lotteries, citizens consent only to the procedure of lots, but not to the product of the lots (even if they produce election of the average person). That is, if the revolutionaries prioritized consent to be governed over equal opportunity to serve as the government, then their choice of elections over lotteries makes sense.

====Michels====
A major scholarly attack on the basis of democracy was made by German-Italian political scientist [[Robert Michels]] who developed the mainstream political science theory of the [[iron law of oligarchy]] in 1911.&lt;ref name="hyland"&gt;James L. Hyland. ''Democratic theory: the philosophical foundations''. Manchester, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Manchester University Press ND, 1995. Pp. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; Michels argued that [[oligarchy]] is inevitable as an "[[iron law of oligarchy|iron law]]" within any organization as part of the "tactical and technical necessities" of organization and on the topic of democracy, Michels stated: "It is organization which gives birth to the dominion of the elected over the electors, of the mandataries over the mandators, of the delegates over the delegators. Who says organization, says oligarchy" and went on to state "Historical evolution mocks all the prophylactic measures that have been adopted for the prevention of oligarchy."&lt;ref name="hyland" /&gt; Michels stated that the official goal of democracy of eliminating elite rule was impossible, that democracy is a [[façade]] legitimizing the rule of a particular elite, and that elite rule, that he refers to as oligarchy, is inevitable.&lt;ref name="hyland" /&gt; Michels had formerly been a Marxist but became drawn to the syndicalism of Sorel, [[Eduoard Berth]], [[Arturo Labriola]], and [[Enrico Leone (economist)|Enrico Leone]] and had become strongly opposed parliamentarian, legalistic, and bureaucratic socialism of [[social democracy]] and in contrast supported an activist, voluntarist, anti-parliamentarian socialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nvD2rZSVau4C&amp;pg=418|title=World Fascism: a Historical Encyclopedia|author=Blamires, Cyprian|publisher=ABC-CLIO, Inc.|year=2006|volume=1|location=Santa Barbara, California|page=418}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michels would later become a supporter of fascism upon Mussolini's rise to power in 1922, viewing fascism's goal to destroy liberal democracy in a sympathetic manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nvD2rZSVau4C&amp;pg=418|title=World Fascism: a Historical Encyclopedia|author=Blamires, Cyprian|publisher=ABC-CLIO, Inc.|year=2006|volume=1|location=Santa Barbara, California|pages=418–419}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Maurras====
[[Charles Maurras]], an FRS member of the ''[[Action française]]'' movement, stated in a famous dictum "Democracy is evil, democracy is death." Maurras' concept of ''politique naturelle'' declared recognition of inescapable biological inequality and thereby natural hierarchies, and claimed that the individual is naturally subordinated to social collectivities such as the family, the society, and the state, which he claims are doomed to fail if based upon the "myth of equality" or "abstract liberty". Maurras criticized democracy as being a "government by numbers" in which quantity matters more over quality and prefers the worst over the best. Maurras denounced the principles of [[liberalism]] as described in ''[[The Social Contract]]'' by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and in ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]'' as based upon the false assumption of liberty and the false assumption of equality. He claimed that the [[parliamentary system]] subordinates the national interest, or common good, to private interests of a parliament's representatives where only short-sighted interests of individuals prevail.

====Lagardelle====
French revolutionary [[Syndicalism|syndicalist]] [[Hubert Lagardelle]] claimed that French revolutionary syndicalism came to being as the result of "the reaction of the [[proletariat]] against democracy," which he claimed was "the ''popular form'' of [[bourgeois]] dominance." Lagardelle opposed democracy for its universalism, and believed in the necessity of class separation of the proletariat from the bourgeoisie, as democracy did not recognize the social differences between them.

====Shach====
Israeli politician Rabbi [[Elazar Menachem Shach]] promoted [[Halakha|Judaic law]] to be the natural governance for [[Jews]] and condemned democracy, he claimed that "Democracy as a machinery of lies, false notions, pursuit of narrow interests and deceit - as opposed to the [[Torah]] regime, which is based on seeking the ultimate truth." Shach criticized democracy for having no real goals, saying "The whole point of democracy is money. The one does what the other asks him to do in pursuit of his own interest, so as to be given what he himself asks for, and the whole purpose of the transaction is that each would get what they want."

== Criticism of democracy's process ==

===Political instability===
More recently, democracy is criticized for not offering enough political stability. As governments are frequently elected on and off there tend to be frequent changes in the policies of democratic countries both domestically and internationally. Even if a political party maintains power, vociferous, headline grabbing protests and harsh criticism from the mass media are often enough to force sudden, unexpected political change. Frequent policy changes with regard to business and immigration are likely to deter investment and so hinder economic growth. For this reason, many people have put forward the idea that democracy is undesirable for a developing country in which economic growth and the reduction of poverty are top priority.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7646295.stm|title=Head to head: African democracy|last=Richburg|first=Keith|date=October 16, 2008|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=April 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Anthony Downs argued that the political market works much the same way as the economic market, and that there could potentially be an equilibrium in the system because of democratic process.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, he eventually argued that imperfect knowledge in politicians and voters prevented the reaching of that equilibrium.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Downs|first=Anthony|last2=|first2=|date=April 1957|title=An Economic Theory of Political Action in a Democracy|journal=Journal of Political Economy|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|volume=65|issue=2|pages=135–150|doi=10.1086/257897|jstor=1827369}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Short-termism====
Democracy is also criticised for frequent elections due to the instability of coalition governments. Coalitions are frequently formed ''after'' the elections in many countries (for example [[India]]) and the basis of alliance is predominantly to enable a viable majority, not an ideological concurrence.

This opportunist alliance not only has the handicap of having to cater to too many ideologically opposing factions, but it is usually short lived since any perceived or actual imbalance in the treatment of coalition partners, or changes to leadership in the coalition partners themselves, can very easily result in the coalition partner withdrawing its support from the government.

Democratic institutions work on consensus to decide an issue, which usually takes longer than a unilateral decision.

[[M. S. Golwalkar]] in his book [[Bunch of Thoughts]] describes democracy as, "is to a very large extent only a myth in practice...The high-sounding concept of "individual freedom" only meant the freedom of those talented few to exploit the rest."

====Corruption====
This is a simple form of appealing to the short term interests of the voters.

Another form is commonly called [[Pork barrel]], where local areas or political sectors are given special benefits but whose costs are spread among all [[taxpayers]].

Mere elections are just one aspect of the democratic process. Other tenets of democracy, like relative equality and freedom, are frequently absent in ostensibly democratic countries.

Moreover, in many countries, democratic participation is less than 50% at times, and it can be argued that election of individual(s) instead of ideas disrupts democracy.

==== Potential incompatibility with former politics ====
The new establishment of democratic institutions, in countries where the associated practices have as yet been uncommon or deemed culturally unacceptable, can result in institutions that are not sustainable in the long term. One circumstance supporting this outcome may be when it is part of the common perception among the populace that the institutions were established as a direct result of foreign pressure.

Sustained regular inspection from democratic countries, however effortful and well-meaning, are normally not sufficient in preventing the erosion of democratic practices. In the cases of several African countries, corruption still is rife in spite of democratically elected governments, as one of the most severe examples, Zimbabwe, is often perceived to have backfired into outright militarism.

===Efficiency of the system===
Economist Donald Wittman has written numerous works attempting to counter criticisms of democracy common among his colleagues. He argues democracy is efficient based on the premise of rational voters, competitive elections, and relatively low political transactions costs. Economist Bryan Caplan argues that, while Wittman makes strong arguments for the latter two points, the first is vitiated by the insurmountable evidence for voter irrationality. The problem is not merely the voters' lack of information, but their poor judgement. For many voters, the difficulty of learning about a particular issue is too high compared to the likely costs of ignorance, but this ignorance does not lessen their enthusiasm for voting.&lt;ref&gt;Caplan, Bryan. [http://econjwatch.org/articles/from-friedman-to-wittman-the-transformation-of-chicago-political-economy ''"From Friedman to Wittman: The Transformation of Chicago Political Economy"''], Econ Journal Watch, April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Other economists, such as Meltzer and Richard, have added that as industrial activity in a democracy increases, so too do the people's demands for subsidies and support from the government. By the [[median voter theorem]], only a few people actually hold the balance of power in the country, and many may be unhappy with their decisions. In this way, they argue, democracies are inefficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meltzer|first=Allan H.|last2=Richard|first2=Scott F.|date=October 1981|title=A Rational Theory of the Size of Government|journal=Journal of Political Economy|publisher=[[The University of Chicago Press]]|volume=89|issue=5|pages=914–927|doi=10.1086/261013|jstor=1830813|accessdate=April 28, 2014|url=http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1749&amp;context=tepper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such a system could result in a wealth disparity or racial discrimination. Fierlbeck (1998) points out that such a result is not necessarily due to a failing in the democratic process, but rather, "because democracy is responsive to the desires of a large middle class increasingly willing to disregard the muted voices of economically marginalized groups within its own borders."&lt;ref&gt;Shrag, P. (1956), "india elected anarchy." ''nehru'', 289(1734), 50-9.&lt;/ref&gt; The will of the democratic majority may not always be in the best interest of all citizens.

=== Susceptibility to propaganda ===

====Lack of political education====
{{See also|Low information voter|Low-information rationality|Deliberative democracy|Meritocracy}}
Voters may not be educated enough to exercise their democratic rights prudently. Politicians may take advantage of voters' irrationality, and compete more in the field of [[public relations]] and tactics, than in ideology. While arguments against democracy are often taken by advocates of democracy as an attempt to maintain or revive traditional hierarchy and autocratic rule, many extensions have been made to develop the argument further.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt; In Lipset's 1959 essay about the requirements for forming democracy, he found that almost all emerging democracies provided good education. However, education alone cannot sustain a democracy, though Caplan did note in 2005 that as people become educated, they think more like economists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bendix|first=Reinhard|last2=Lipset|first2=Seymour M.|date=June 1957|title=Political Sociology|url=http://csi.sagepub.com/content/6/2/79.extract|journal=Current Sociology|volume=6|issue=2|pages=79–99|doi=10.1177/001139215700600201|accessdate=April 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Manipulation or control of public opinion ====
{{Off topic}}
{{See also|Crowd manipulation|Media manipulation|Allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections}}
Politicians and special interests have attempted to manipulate [[public opinion]] for as long as recorded history − this has put into question the feasibility of democratic government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jacobs|first1=Lawrence R.|date=1 December 2001|title=Commentary: Manipulators and Manipulation: Public Opinion in a Representative Democracy|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/15635|journal=Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law|volume=26|issue=6|pages=1361–1374|issn=1527-1927|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07393148.2015.1125119?src=recsys&amp;journalCode=cnps20|title=Manipulating Citizens: How Political Campaigns’ Use of Behavioral Social Science Harms Democracy|last1=Gorton|first1=William A.|date=2 January 2016|website=New Political Science|pages=61–80|doi=10.1080/07393148.2015.1125119|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics claim that mass media actually shapes public opinion, and can therefore be used to "control" democracy. [[Opinion poll]]s before the election are under special criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2015/11/30/does-polling-undermine-democracy/polls-can-create-an-illusion-of-public-opinion|title=Does Polling Undermine Democracy?|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davis|first1=Colin J.|last2=Bowers|first2=Jeffrey S.|last3=Memon|first3=Amina|date=30 March 2011|title=Social Influence in Televised Election Debates: A Potential Distortion of Democracy|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0018154|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=6|issue=3|pages=e18154|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0018154|issn=1932-6203|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the disclosure of reputation damaging material shortly before elections may be used to significantly manipulate public opinion. In the United States the FBI was criticized for announced that the agency would examine potentially incriminating evidence against Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server just 11 days before the election.&lt;ref name="wash1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/01/12/was-the-2016-u-s-election-democratic-we-see-7-serious-shortfalls/|title=Was the 2016 U.S. election democratic?

In 2016 [[Andrés Sepúlveda]] disclosed that he manipulated public opinion to rig elections in Latin America. According to him with a budget of $600,000 he led a team of hackers that stole campaign strategies, manipulated [[social media]] to create false waves of enthusiasm and derision, and installed [[spyware]] in opposition offices to help [[Enrique Peña Nieto]], a right-of-center candidate, win the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-how-to-hack-an-election/|title=How to Hack an Election|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/political-cyberhacker-andres-sepulveda-reveals-how-he-digitally-rigged-elections-across-latin-a6965161.html|title=Man claims he rigged elections in most Latin American countries over 8 years|date=2 April 2016|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Manipulation of the opposition====
{{Further|Suppression of dissent}}
Various reasons can be found for eliminating or suppressing political opponents. Methods such as [[false flag]]s, [[Anti-terrorism legislation|counterterrorism-laws]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5VYIAQAAMAAJ|title=Chronicles|publisher=Rockford Institute|language=en|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; planting or creating compromising material and perpetuation of public fear may be used to suppress dissent. After a failed [[2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt|coup d'état]] over 110,000 people have been purged and nearly 40,000 have been imprisoned in Turkey, which is or was considered to be a democratic nation, during the [[2016 Turkish purges]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/269f0b22-8a27-11e6-8aa5-f79f5696c731|title=Turkey’s crackdown on dissent has gone too far|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.salon.com/2016/11/02/turkeys-ruthless-slow-motion-coup-110000-purged-as-western-ally-cracks-down-on-dissent-journalism/|title=Turkey’s ruthless, slow-motion coup: 110,000 purged as Western ally cracks down on dissent, journalism|last1=Norton|first1=Ben|publisher=Salon|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fake parties, phantom political rivals and "scarecrow" opponents may be used to undermine the opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Virtual politics : faking democracy in the post-Soviet world|last1=Wilson|first1=Andrew|date=2005|publisher=Yale Univ.

=== Limited responsiveness and representation ===
Robert A. Dahl defines democracies as systems of government that respond nearly fully to each and every one of their citizens. He then poses that no such, fully responsive system exists today.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; However, this does not mean that ''partially'' democratic regimes do not exist—they do. Thus, Dahl rejects a democracy dichotomy in favor of a democratization spectrum. To Dahl, the question is not whether a country is a democracy or not. The question is to what extent a country is experiencing democratization at a national level. Dahl measures this democratization in terms of the country's endorsement and reception of public contestation. And polyarchy, or "rule of the many people," is the only existing form of democratizeable government; that is, it is within polyarchies that democratization can flourish. Countries do not immediately transform from hegemonies and competitive oligarchies into democracies. Instead, a country that adopts democracy as its form of government can only claim to have switched to polyarchy, which is conducive to, but does not guarantee, democratization. Dahl's polyarchy spectrum ends at the point in which a country becomes a full polyarchy at the national level and begins to democratize at the subnational level, among its social and private affairs. Dahl is not deeply concerned about the limits of his polyarchy spectrum because he believes that most countries today still have a long way before they reach full polyarchy status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=After the Revolution? Authority in a Good Society|last=Dahl|first=Robert A.|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1970|isbn=|location=New Haven|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Dahl, whatever lies beyond full polyarchy is only possible, and thus only a concern, for advanced countries like the Western Europe.

== Criticism of democracy's outcome ==

===Mob rule===
{{Main|Ochlocracy}}
[[Plato|Plato's]] ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' presents a critical view of democracy through the narration of [[Socrates]]: "Democracy, which is a charming form of government, full of variety and disorder, and dispensing a sort of equality to equals and unequaled alike."&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''the Republic of Plato'' (London: J.M Dent &amp; Sons LTD.; New York: E.P. Dutton &amp; Co. Inc.), 558-C.&lt;/ref&gt; In his work, Plato lists 5 forms of government from best to worst. Assuming that ''the Republic'' was intended to be a serious critique of the political thought in Athens, Plato argues that only [[Utopia|Kallipolis]], an aristocracy led by the unwilling philosopher-kings (the wisest men), is a [[justice|just]] form of government.

Plato rejected [[Athenian democracy]] on the basis that such democracies were anarchic societies without internal unity, that they followed citizens' impulses rather than pursuing the common good, that democracies are unable to allow a sufficient number of their citizens to have their voices heard, and that such democracies were typically run by fools. Plato attacked Athenian democracies for mistaking anarchy for freedom. The lack of coherent unity in Athenian democracy made Plato conclude that such democracies were a mere collection of individuals occupying a common space rather than a form of political organization.

According to Plato, other forms of government place too much focus on lesser virtues and degenerate into other forms from best to worst, starting with [[timocracy]], which overvalues honour, then [[oligarchy]], which overvalues wealth, which is followed by democracy. In democracy, the oligarchs, or merchant, are unable to wield their power effectively and the people take over, electing someone who plays on their wishes (for example, by throwing lavish festivals). However, the government grants the people too much freedom, and the state degenerates into the fourth form, [[tyranny]], or [[Ochlocracy|mob rule]].&lt;ref&gt;Michels, Robert. [http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/toc/modeng/public/MicPoli.html ''Political Parties – A Sociological Study of the Oligarchical Tendencies of Modern Democracy,''] Jarrold &amp; Sons. London, 1916.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Oppression by the majority====
{{Further|Tyranny of the majority}}
The [[constitutions]] of many countries have parts of them that restrict the nature of the types of laws that [[legislatures]]
can pass.  A fundamental idea behind some of these restrictions, is that the majority of a population and its elected legislature can often be the source of minority persecutions, such as with [[racial discrimination]]. For example, during the mid-1930s and mid-1970s in the democratic country of Sweden, the government forcibly sterilized thousands of innocent women. They were sterilized due to "'mental defects', or simply because they were of mixed race."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.inter.nl.net/users/Paul.Treanor/democracy.html|title=Why democracy is wrong|website=web.inter.nl.net|accessdate=October 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second example is when, in 2014 in Pakistan, "a Christian couple were burnt alive in a brick kiln by a mob for their alleged burning of the pages of Quran."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.khilafah.com/capitalism-and-democracy-have-failed-to-protect-the-rights-of-minorities/|title=The Khilafah|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by little police retaliation and a statement from the President of Pakistan stating that his government would protect the rights and interests of the Christian community. Some countries throughout the world have judiciaries where judges can serve for long periods of time, and often serve under appointed posts. This is often balanced, however, by the fact that some trials are decided by [[juries]]. While many, like Wittman, have argued that democracies work much the same way as the free market and that there is competition among parties to prevent oppression by the majority, others have argued that there is actually very little competition among political parties in democracies due to the high cost associated with campaigning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/jlecono1&amp;div=8&amp;id=&amp;page=|title=Competition and Democracy|last=Becker|first=Gary S.|year=1958|publisher=HeinOnline|accessdate=April 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John T. Wenders, a professor of Economics at the [[University of Idaho]], writes:

{{quote|"Freedom and democracy are different. In words attributed to Scottish historian Alexander Tytler: 'A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only exist until a majority of voters discover that they can vote themselves largess out of the public treasury.' Democracy evolves into kleptocracy. A majority bullying a minority is just as bad as a dictator, communist or otherwise, doing so. Democracy is two coyotes and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Democracy Would Doom Hong Kong|first=John T.|last=Wenders|publisher=[[Foundation for Economic Education]]|date=January 1, 1998|accessdate=April 27, 2014|url=http://www.fee.org/the_freeman/detail/democracy-would-doom-hong-kong}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Additionally, some political scientists question the notion that majority rule is an "uncontested good."&lt;ref&gt;Fierlbeck, K. (1998) ''Globalizing Democracy: Power, Legitimacy and the Interpretation of democratic ideas.'' (p. 13) Manchester University Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; If we base our critique on the definition of democracy as governance based on the will of the majority, there can be some foreseeable consequences to this form of rule. For example, Fierlbeck (1998: 12) points out that the middle class majority in a country may decide to redistribute wealth and resources into the hands of those that they feel are most capable of investing or increasing them. Of course this is only a critique of a subset of types of democracy that primarily use majority rule.

US President [[James Madison]] devoted the whole of [[Federalist No. 10]] to a scathing critique of democracy and offered that republics are a far better solution, saying: "...democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths." Madison offered that republics were superior to democracies because republics safeguarded against tyranny of the majority, stating in [[Federalist No. 10]]: "the same advantage which a republic has over a democracy, in controlling the effects of faction, is enjoyed by a large over a small republic".

The [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] intended to address this criticism by combining democracy with [[republicanism]]. A [[constitution]]&lt;ref&gt;Lowell, A. Lawrence. [https://archive.org/stream/essaysongovernm01lowegoog#page/n70/mode/2up ''"Democracy and the Constitution,"''] Essays on Government, Houghton Mifflin &amp; Co. New York, 1890.&lt;/ref&gt; would limit the powers of what a simple majority can accomplish.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Madison]], [http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa10.htm Federalist No. 10]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cyclical theory of government====
[[Machiavelli]] put the idea that democracies will tend to cater to the whims of the people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QZzHJlvXD-YC|title=Alexis de Tocqueville and the Art of Democratic Statesmanship|last1=Danoff|first1=Brian|last2=Hebert|first2=Louie Joseph|publisher=Lexington Books|year=2011|isbn=978-0-7391-4529-6|page=88|accessdate=April 25, 2014}}
&lt;/ref&gt; who follow false ideas to entertain themselves, squander their reserves, and do not deal with potential threats to their rule until it is too late. He put forth a cyclical theory of government where monarchies tend to decay into aristocracies, which then decay into democracies, which subsequently decay into anarchy, then tyranny, then return to monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vWJtAAAAQBAJ|title=The Foundations of Evolutionary Institutional Economics: Generic Institutionalism|last=Wäckerle|first=Manuel|date=August 15, 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-81076-0|page=302|accessdate=April 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QYVZ3TjL0-UC|title=Models of Democracy|last=Held|first=David|publisher=[[Stanford University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=9780804754729|page=40|accessdate=April 25, 2014}}
&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the timeline of France before, during, and after the Revolution until the last Bourbon Monarch.

However Machiavelli's definition of democracy was narrower than the current one. He hypothesized that a hybrid system of government incorporating facets of all three major types (monarchy, aristocracy and democracy) could break this cycle. Many modern democracies that have [[separation of powers]] are claimed to represent these kinds of hybrid governments. However, in modern democracies there is usually no direct correlation with Machiavelli's idea, because of weakening of the separation of powers, or erosion of the original function of the various branches. For example, the modern United States executive branch has slowly accumulated more power from the legislative branch, and the Senate no longer functions as a quasi-aristocratic body as was originally intended, since senators are now democratically elected.

===Political Coase theorem===
Some have tried to argue that the [[Coase theorem]] applies to political markets as well. [[Daron Acemoglu]], however, provides evidence to the contrary, claiming that the Coase Theorem is only valid while there are "rules of the game," so to speak, that are being enforced by the government. But when there is nobody there to enforce the rules for the government itself, there is no way to guarantee that low transaction costs will lead to an efficient outcome in democracies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Acemoglu|first=Daron|authorlink=Daron Acemoglu|date=2003|title=Why Not A Political Coase Theorem?

'''Deglobalization''' or '''Deglobalisation''' is the process of diminishing interdependence and integration between certain units around the world, typically nation-states. It is widely used to describe the periods of history when economic trade and investment between countries decline. It stands in contrast to [[globalization]], in which units become increasingly integrated over time, and generally spans the time between periods of globalization. While globalization and deglobalisation are antitheses, they are no mirror images

The term of deglobalization has derived from some of the very profound change in many developed nations, where trade as a proportion of total economic activity until the 1970s was below previous peak levels in the early 1910s. This decline reflects that their economies become less integrated with the rest of the world economies in spite of the deepening scope of [[economic globalization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=New York University Department of Sociology|title=The Sociology Project|year=2013|publisher=Pearson|location=United States of America|isbn=978-0-205-09382-3 |page=569}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the  global level only two longer periods of deglobalization occurred, namely in the 1930s during the Great Depression and 2010s, when following the [[Great Trade Collapse]] the period of the World Trade Slowdown&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hoekman|first1=Bernhard|title=The Global Trade Slowdown: A New Normal?|date=2015|publisher=CEPR VOXEU|location=Florence ; European University Institute, 2015|url=https://voxeu.org/sites/default/files/file/Global%20Trade%20Slowdown_nocover.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; set in.

The occurrence of deglobalization has strong proponents who have claimed the death of globalisation, but is also contested by leading academics such as Michael Bordo &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bordo |first1=Michael |title=The Second Era of Globalization is Not Yet Over: An Historical Perspective |journal=NBER Working Paper No. 23786 |date=September 2017 |doi=10.3386/w23786 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who argues that it is too soon to give a good diagnosis and Mervyn Martin &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martin|first1=Mervyn|title=Keeping it Real: Debunking the Deglobalization Myth, Brexit, and Trump:-"Lessons" on Integration' ;|journal=Journal of International Trade Law and Policy|volume=17|pages=62–68|date=2018|doi=10.1108/JITLP-06-2017-0020|url=https://tees.openrepository.com/tees/handle/10149/621562|type=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt; who argues that US and UK policies are rational answers to essential temporary problems of even strong nations

While as with globalization, deglobalization can refer to economic, trade, social, technological, cultural and political dimensions, much of the work that has been conducted in the study of deglobalization refers to the field of [[international economics]].

== 1930s versus 2010s ==

Periods of deglobalization have mainly been seen as interesting comparators to other periods, such as 1850–1914 and 1950–2007, in which globalization had been the norm, given that globalization is the norm for most people and because the interpretation of the global economy has mainly been framed as inevitably increasing integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Livesey|first1=Finbarr.|title=Unpacking the possibilities of deglobalisation|journal=Cambridge Journal of Regions, Economy and Society|date=2018|volume=11|issue=1|pages=177–187|doi=10.1093/cjres/rsx030}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, even periods of stagnant international interaction are often wrongly seen as periods of deglobalization. Recently scientists, have started to also compare the major periods of deglobalization in order to better understand drivers and consequences of this phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O’Rourke|first1=Kevin Hjortshøj|title=Two Great Trade Collapses: The Interwar Period and Great Recession Compared.|journal=IMF Economic Review|volume=66|issue=3|pages=418–439|date=2018|doi=10.1057/s41308-017-0046-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van Bergeijk|first1=Peter A.G.|title=On the brink of Deglobalisation ... again|journal=Cambridge Journal of Regions, Economy and Society|date=2018|volume=11|issue=2|pages=59–72|doi=10.1093/cjres/rsx023}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two major phases of deglobalisation are not identical twins.The two phases of deglobalisation were equally triggered by a demand shock in the wake of a financial crisis. Both in the 1930s and in the 2000s the composition of trade was a second key determinant: manufacturing trade bore the brunt of the contraction. One important finding is that country experiences both during the Great Depression and Great Recession are very heterogeneous so that one-size-fits-all policies to counter negative impacts of deglobalization are inappropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bergeijk, Peter AG|author2=Steven Brakman|author3=Charles Marrewijk|title=Heterogeneous economic resilience and the great recession's world trade collapse.|journal=Papers in Regional Science|date=2017|volume=96|issue=1|pages=3–12|doi=10.1111/pirs.12279}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s, democracies supported free trade, and deglobalisation was driven by autocratic decisions to strengthen self-sufficiency. In the 2010s, political institutions are just as significant, but now democratic decisions such as the election of President Trump with an America First agenda&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Simon J. Evenett|author2=Johannes Fritz|title=Will Awe Trump Rules?|url=http://www.globaltradealert.org/reports/42|publisher=global trade alert|accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Brexit drive the deglobalisation process worldwide. Indeed, while the industrialised countries in the 2010s avoided the pitfalls of protectionism and deflation, they have experienced different political dynamics.

== Measures of deglobalization ==

As with globalization, economic deglobalization can be measured in different ways. These centre around the four main economic flows:
* Goods and services, e.g. exports plus imports as a proportion of [[national income]] or per head of population.
* Labour/people, e.g. net [[Human migration|migration rate]]s; inward or outward migration flows, weighted by population (and resultant remittances in per cent of GDP)
* Capital, e.g. inward or outward direct investment as a proportion of national income or per head of population
It is generally not thought possible to measure deglobalization through lack of flows of technology, the fourth main flow. 
Those areas that are measurable do suggest other possible measures, including:
* Average tariffs
* Border restrictions on labour
* [[Capital controls]], including restrictions on foreign direct investment or outward direct investment

The multi-dimensional globalization index of KOF Swiss Economic Institute shows a clear break for economic globalization in 2009 in 2015 KOF observed for its overall index: "The level of globalisation worldwide increased rapidly between 1990 and 2007 and has risen only slightly since the Great Recession. In 2015, globalisation decreased for the first time since 1975. The fall was due to the decline in economic globalisation, with social globalisation stagnating and political globalisation increasing slightly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=KOF|title=press-release/2018/01/kof-globalisation-index-globalisation-down-worldwide-in-2015|url=https://www.kof.ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/media/press-releases/2018/01/kof-globalisation-index-globalisation-down-worldwide-in-2015.html|website=www.kof.ethz.ch|publisher=KOF|accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other indicators of deglobalization include the development of Foreign Direct Investment, that according to UNCTAD slipped further in 2017 and in stark contrast with production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=UNCTAD|title=Global Investment Trends Monitor|url=http://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/diaeia2018d1_en.pdf|website=unctad.org|accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Risks of deglobalization==
Typically a reduction of the level of international integration of economies (and the world economy at large) are expected to exert second round effects related to four feedback mechanisms:&lt;ref name="brink"&gt;Peter A.G. van Bergeijk, [http://deglobalization.blogspot.nl/ ''On the brink of Deglobalization'',] (Edward Elgar, 2010), {{ISBN|9781849804110}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*a reduction of (the rate of growth) of international trade will feed negatively into long-run growth
*a loss of interaction, the co-movement of economies,
*[[trade policy]] feedbacks in the sense that reduced international interaction and lower growth will stimulate [[protectionism]] and non-economic issue areas where reduced cooperation among countries and even an increasing risk of international conflict can be expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Murshed|first1=s. mansoob|title=Challenges to the liberal peace|url=https://issblog.nl/2018/04/03/deglobalisation-series-challenges-to-the-liberal-peace-by-syed-mansoob-murshed/|website=BLISS|accessdate=3 April 2018|date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== (International) political economy of deglobalization ==
Deglobalization has also been used as a political agenda item or a term in framing the debate on a new [[World economic order]], for example by [[Walden Bello]] in his 2005 book ''Deglobalization''.&lt;ref name="bello"&gt;Walden Bello, [http://us.macmillan.com/BookCustomPage.aspx?isbn=1842775456&amp;m_type=7 ''Deglobalization: Ideas for a New World Economy'',] (Zed books, 2005). {{ISBN|9781842775455}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One of the prominent examples of deglobalization movement could be found in the United States of America, where the Bush and Obama administration instituted [[Buy American Act]] clause as party of massive stimulus package, which was designed to favor American-made goods over traded goods. Likewise, the EU has imposed new subsidies to protect their agricultural sectors for their own protection. These movements of deglobalization can be seen as the example of how developed nations react to the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08]] through deglobalization movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Office of the Law Revision Counsel |url=http://uscode.house.gov/uscode-cgi/fastweb.exe?getdoc+uscview+t41t42+22+1++(41)%20%20AND%2 |publisher=US House of Representatives |accessdate=2013-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120806135758/http://uscode.house.gov/uscode-cgi/fastweb.exe?getdoc+uscview+t41t42+22+1++%2841%29%20%20AND%252 |archivedate=August 6, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Recently a change in the pattern of anti-globalism has been observed: anti-globalism now has a strong foothold in the Global North and among right-wing (conservative) politicians,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Rory Horner|author2=Daniel Haberly|author3=Seth Schindler|author4=Yuko Aoyama|title=How anti-globalisation switched from a left to a right-wing issue – and where it will go next|url=https://theconversation.com/how-anti-globalisation-switched-from-a-left-to-a-right-wing-issue-and-where-it-will-go-next-90587|website=The conversation|accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with much different attitudes in the Global South, particular among the BRICS countries.

The '''early modern period''' of [[modern history]] follows the [[late Middle Ages]] of the [[post-classical era]]. Although the chronological limits of the period are open to debate, the [[timeline|timeframe]] spans the period after the late portion of the [[post-classical age]] (c. 1500), known as the [[Middle Ages]], through the beginning of the [[Age of Revolutions]] (c. 1800) and is variously demarcated by historians as beginning with the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, with the [[Renaissance]] period, and with the [[Age of Discovery]] (especially with the [[voyages of Christopher Columbus]] beginning in 1492, but also with [[Vasco da Gama]]'s [[Vasco da Gama#First voyage|discovery of the sea route to the East]] in 1498), and ending around the [[French Revolution]] in 1789.

Historians in recent decades have argued that from a worldwide standpoint, the most important feature of the early modern period was its [[proto-globalization|globalizing]] character.&lt;ref&gt;Jan De Vries,  "The limits of globalization in the early modern world." ''Economic History Review'' (2010) 63#3 pp: 710–733.&lt;/ref&gt; The period witnessed the exploration and colonization of [[the Americas]] and the rise of sustained contacts between previously isolated parts of the globe. The [[historical power]]s became involved in global trade, as the exchange of goods, plants, animals, and food crops extended to the [[Old World]] and the [[New World]]. The [[Columbian Exchange]] greatly affected the human environment.

New economies and institutions emerged, becoming more sophisticated and globally articulated over the course of the early modern period. This process began in the medieval North Italian [[city-states]], particularly [[Genoa]], [[Venice]], and [[Milan]]. The early modern period also included the rise of the dominance of the economic theory of [[mercantilism]]. The [[European colonialism|European colonization]] of the Americas, Asia, and Africa occurred during the 15th to 19th centuries, and [[History of Christianity#Catholic missions|spread Christianity]] around the world.

The early modern trends in various regions of the world represented a shift away from medieval modes of organization, politically and economically. [[Feudalism]] declined in Europe, while the period also included the [[Protestant Reformation]], the disastrous [[Thirty Years' War]], the [[Commercial Revolution]], the [[European colonization of the Americas]], and the [[Golden Age of Piracy]].

By the 16th century the economy under the [[Ming Dynasty]] was stimulated by trade with the Portuguese, the Spanish, and the Dutch, while Japan engaged in the [[Nanban trade]] after the arrival of the first European Portuguese during the [[Azuchi-Momoyama period]].

Other notable trends of the early modern period include the development of experimental science, accelerated travel due to improvements in mapping and ship design, increasingly rapid [[History of technology|technological progress]], [[secular]]ized civic politics, and the emergence of [[nation state]]s. Historians typically date the end of the early modern period when the [[French Revolution]] of the 1790s began the "late modern"  period.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Bayly|Christopher Alan Bayly]], ''The birth of the modern world, 1780–1914: global connections and comparisons'' (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chinese dynasties ===
[[File:Cishou Temple Pagoda.JPG|thumb|right|[[Pagoda of Cishou Temple|Cishou Temple Pagoda]], built in 1576: the Chinese believed that building pagodas on certain sites according to [[Feng shui|geomantic principles]] brought about auspicious events; merchant-funding for such projects was needed by the late Ming period.]]
Around the beginning of the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368—1644), China was leading the world in mathematics as well as science. However, Europe soon caught up to China's scientific and mathematical achievements and surpassed them.&lt;ref&gt;Needham, J. (1956). Mathematics and science in china and the west. ''Science and Society, 20'', 320. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://search-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/docview/1296937594?accountid=14523&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The reason behind China's lag in advancement has speculated by many scholars. A historian named Colin Ronan claims that though there is no one specific answer, there must be a connection between China's urgency for new discoveries being weaker than Europe's and China's inability to capitalize on its early advantages. Ronan believes that China's Confucian bureaucracy and traditions led to China not having a scientific revolution, which led China to have fewer scientists who would break the existing orthodoxies, like Galileo Galilei.&lt;ref&gt;Bala, Arun. ''The Dialogue of Civilizations in the Birth of Modern Science''. 1st ed. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2006. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/lib/ucsc/detail.action?docID=308211#&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Despite inventing gunpowder in the 9th century, it was in Europe that the classic handheld firearms, matchlocks, were invented, with evidence of use around the 1480s. China was using the matchlocks by 1540, after the Portuguese brought their matchlocks to Japan in the early 1500s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Andrade, Tonio. ''The Gunpowder Age: China, Military Innovation, and the Rise of the West in World History'', 2016. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/lib/ucsc/detail.action?docID=4089513#&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; China during the Ming Dynasty established a bureau to maintain its calendar. The bureau was necessary because the calendars were linked to celestial phenomena and that needs regular maintenance because twelve lunar months have 344 or 355 days, so occasional leap months have to be added in order to maintain 365 days per year.&lt;ref&gt;Elman, Benjamin A. ''On their own terms: science in China, 1550-1900''. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2005. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/lib/ucsc/detail.action?docID=3300298#&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 16th century the Ming dynasty flourished over maritime trade with the Portuguese, Spanish and Dutch Empires. The trade brought in a massive amount of silver, which China at the time needed desperately. Prior to China's global trade, its economy ran on a paper money. However, in the 14th century, China's paper money system suffered a crisis, and by the mid-15th century, crashed.&lt;ref&gt;Flynn, D. O., &amp; Giraldez, A. (1995). Arbitrage, china and world trade in the early modern period. ''Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient, 38'', 429. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://search-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/docview/1304349602?accountid=14523&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The silver imports helped fill the void left by the broken paper money system, which helps explain why the value of silver in China was twice as high as the value of silver in Spain during the end of the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, Andre Gunder. ''ReOrient: Global Economy in the Asian Age''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1998. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://hdl.handle.net/2027/heb.31038.0001.001&lt;/nowiki&gt; (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ming Dynasty suffered an economic collapse in the seventeenth-century because of heavy inflation of silver, and the European trade depression of the 1620s. The economy sunk to the point where all of China's trading partner cut ties with them: [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]] restricted shipments of exports from [[Acapulco]], the Japanese cut off all trade with [[Macau]], and the Dutch severed connections between [[Gao]] and Macau.&lt;ref&gt;Wakeman, F. E. (1986). China and the seventeenth-century crisis. ''Late Imperial China, 7''(1), 1. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://search-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/docview/1308082978?accountid=14523&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The damage to the economy was compounded by the effects on agriculture of the incipient [[Little Ice Age]], natural calamities, crop failure and sudden epidemics. The ensuing breakdown of authority and people's livelihoods allowed rebel leaders, such as [[Li Zicheng]], to challenge Ming authority.

The Ming Dynasty fell around 1644 to the [[Qing Dynasty]], the last ruling [[dynasties in Chinese history|dynasty]] of China, ruling from 1644 to 1912 (with a brief, [[Manchu Restoration|abortive restoration]] in 1917). During its reign, the Qing Dynasty became highly integrated with [[Chinese culture]].

=== Japanese shogunates ===
Following contact with the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] on [[Tanegashima]] Isle in 1543, the Japanese adopted several of the technologies and cultural practices of their visitors, whether in the military area (the [[arquebus]], European-style cuirasses, European ships), religion ([[Christianity]]), decorative art, language (integration to Japanese of a [[Japanese language#Vocabulary|Western vocabulary]]) and culinary: the Portuguese introduced [[tempura]] and valuable refined sugar.

The [[Azuchi–Momoyama period]] saw the political unification that preceded the establishment of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]. Although a start date of 1573 is often given, in more broad terms, the period begins with [[Oda Nobunaga]]'s entry into Kyoto in 1568, when he led his army to the imperial capital in order to install [[Ashikaga Yoshiaki]] as the 15th, and ultimately final, shōgun of the [[Ashikaga shogunate]], and it lasts until the coming to power of [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] after his victory over supporters of the Toyotomi clan at the [[Battle of Sekigahara]] in 1600.&lt;ref&gt;''Kodansha Encyclopedia of Japan'' (First edition, 1983), section "Azuchi-Momoyama History (1568–1600)" by George Elison, in the entry for "history of Japan".&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Edo period]] from 1600 to 1868 characterized early modern Japan. The Tokugawa shogunate was a [[feudal]]ist regime of Japan established by [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] and ruled by the ''[[shōgun]]s'' of the [[Tokugawa clan]]. The period gets its name from the capital city, [[Edo]], now called Tokyo. The Tokugawa shogunate ruled from [[Edo Castle]] from 1603 until 1868, when it was abolished during the [[Meiji Restoration]] in the late [[Edo period]] (often called the [[Late Tokugawa shogunate]]).

=== Korean dynasty ===
In 1392, General [[Taejo of Joseon|Yi Seong-gye]] established the [[Joseon]] dynasty (1392–1910) with a largely bloodless coup. Yi Seong-gye moved the capital of Korea to the location of modern-day Seoul.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, L. (2014, Mar 21). Honoring the joseon dynasty. ''The Wall Street Journal Asia''Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://search-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/docview/1508838378?accountid=14523&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The dynasty was heavily influenced by Confucianism, which also played a large role to shaping Korea's strong cultural identity.&lt;ref&gt;Tae-gyu, K. (2012, Apr 15). Joseon: Korea's confucian kingdom (1). ''The Korea Times'' Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://search-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/docview/1990220190?accountid=14523&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Tae-gyu, K. (2012, May 29).

During the end of the 16th century, Korea was invaded twice by Japan, first in 1592 and again in 1597. Japan failed both times due to Admiral [[Yi Sun-sin]], Korea's revered naval genius, who lead the Korean Navy using advanced metal clad ships called [[turtle ship]]s. Because the ships were armed with cannons, Admiral Yi's navy was able to demolish the Japanese invading fleets, destroying hundreds of ships in Japan's second invasion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; During the 17th century, Korea was invaded again, this time by the Manchurian, who would later take over China as the Qing Dynasty. In 1637, King [[Injo of Joseon|Injo]] was forced to surrender to the Qing forces, and was ordered to send princesses as concubine to the Qing Prince [[Dorgon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8nXLwSG2O8AC&amp;pg=PA892|title=The Great Enterprise: The Manchu Reconstruction of Imperial Order in Seventeenth-century China|last=Wakeman|first=Frederic E.|date=1985|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520048041|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After invasions from Manchuria, Joseon experienced nearly 200 years of peace. However, whatever power the kingdom recovered during its isolation further waned as the 18th century came to a close, and Korea was faced with internal strife, power struggles, international pressure and rebellions at home. The Joseon dynasty declined rapidly in the late 19th century.

== Indian Empires ==
[[File:Moghol.jpg|thumb|right|Map of the [[Mughal Empire]]]]
On the [[Indian subcontinent]], the [[Lodi dynasty]] ruled over the [[Delhi Sultanate]] during its last phase. The dynasty founded by [[Bahlul Lodi]] ruled from 1451 to 1526. The dynasty's last ruler, Ibrahim Lodhi, was defeated and killed by [[Babur]] in the first [[Battle of Panipat (1526)|Battle of Panipat]].

The [[Vijayanagara Empire]] was based in the [[Deccan Plateau]], but its power was diminished after a major military defeat in 1565 by the [[Deccan sultanates]]. The empire is named after its capital city of [[Vijayanagara]].

The rise of the [[Mughal Empire|Great Mughal Empire]] is usually dated from 1526, around the end of the Middle Ages. It was an [[Islamic state|Islamic]] [[Persianate]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=L.

== Southeast Asia ==
At the start of the modern era, the [[Spice Route]] between India and China crossed [[Majapahit]],&lt;ref name="Ricklefs_19"&gt;M.C. Ricklefs, ''A History of Modern Indonesia Since c. 1300'', 2nd ed.

=== The Ottoman Empire ===
{{main|Classical Age of the Ottoman Empire|Transformation of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman ancien régime}}
[[File:Ottoman empire.svg|thumb|Ottoman Empire 1481–1683]]

During the early modern era, the [[Ottoman state]] enjoyed an [[growth of the Ottoman Empire|expansion and consolidation]] of power, leading to a ''[[Pax Ottomana]]''. This was perhaps the golden age of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The Ottomans expanded southwest into North Africa while battling with the re-emergent [[Persia]]n Shi'a [[Safavid Empire]] to the east.

=== North and Northeast Africa ===
In the [[Saracen]] sphere, the Ottomans seized Egypt in 1517 and established the regencies of [[Algeria]], Tunisia, and [[Tripolitania|Tripoli]] (between 1519 and 1551), [[Morocco]] remaining an independent Arabized [[Berber state]] under the [[Sharifan dynasty]].

[[File:Adal.PNG|thumb|left|The Territory of the [[Adal Sultanate]] and its vassal states circa 1500.]]

In the [[Ethiopian Highlands]], the [[Solomonic dynasty]] established itself in the 13th century. Claiming direct descent from the old [[Axum]]ite royal house, the Solomonic ruled the region well into modern history. In the 16th century, [[Shewa]] and the rest of [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]] were [[Ethiopian-Adal War|conquered]] by the forces of [[Ahmed Gurey]] of the [[Adal Sultanate]] to the northwest. The conquest of the area by the [[Oromo migrations|Oromo]] ended in the contraction of both Adal and Abyssinia, changing regional dynamics for centuries to come.

The [[Ajuran Sultanate|Ajuran Empire]], which was one of the largest and strongest empires in the [[Horn of Africa]], began to decline in the 17th century, and several powerful successor states came to prominence. The [[Geledi Sultanate]], established by [[Ibrahim Adeer]], was a notable successor of the Ajuran Sultanate. The [[Sultanate]] reached its apex under the successive reigns of [[Sultan]] [[Yusuf Mahamud Ibrahim]] (reigned 1798 to 1848), who successfully consolidated Geledi power during the [[Bardera]] wars, and [[Sultan]] [[Ahmed Yusuf (Gobroon)|Ahmed Yusuf]], who forced regional powers such as the [[Oman]]i Empire to pay [[tribute]]. The [[Majeerteen Sultanate]] was a [[Somali people|Somali]] [[Sultan]]ate in the [[Horn of Africa]]. Ruled by [[Boqor|King]] [[Osman Mahamuud]] during its golden age, it controlled much of northern and central [[Somalia]] in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The polity had all of the organs of an integrated modern state and maintained a robust trading network. Along with the [[Sultanate of Hobyo]] ruled by Sultan [[Yusuf Ali Kenadid]], the Majeerteen Sultanate was eventually annexed into [[Italian Somaliland]] in the early 20th century, following the military Campaign of the Sultanates.

=== Sub-Saharan Africa ===
{{further|Dahomey|Aro Confederacy|Ashanti Empire|History of South Africa (1652–1815)}}

The [[Songhai Empire]] took control of the [[trans-Saharan trade]] at the beginning of the modern era. It seized [[Timbuktu]] in 1468 and [[Djenné|Jenne]] in 1473, building the regime on trade revenues and the cooperation of Muslim merchants. The empire eventually made Islam the official religion, built mosques, and brought Muslim scholars to [[Gao]].&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;Ira M. Lapidus, A History of Islamic Societies, Cambridge 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the beginning of the modern era, the [[Benin Kingdom]] was an independent trading power in the southeastern coastline of West Africa, blocking the access of other inland nations to the coastal ports. Benin may have housed 100,000 inhabitants at its height, spreading over twenty-five square kilometres, enclosed by three concentric rings of earthworks. By the late 15th century Benin was in contact with [[Portugal]]. At its apogee in the 16th and 17th centuries, Benin encompassed parts of southeastern Yorubaland and the western [[Igbo people|Igbo]].

=== Safavids ===
{{Main|Safavid Empire}}
The [[Safavid Empire]] was a great Shia [[Persianate society|Persianate empire]] after the Islamic conquest of Persia and established of Islam, marking an important point in the history of Islam in the east. The Safavid dynasty was founded about 1501. From their base in Ardabil, the Safavids established control over all of Persia and reasserted the Iranian identity of the region, thus becoming the first native dynasty since the [[Sassanids]] to establish a unified Iranian state. Problematic for the Safavids was the powerful Ottoman Empire. The Ottomans, a Sunni dynasty, fought several campaigns against the Safavids.

What fueled the growth of Safavid economy was its position between the burgeoning civilizations of Europe to its west and Islamic Central Asia to its east and north. The Silk Road, which led from Europe to East Asia, revived in the 16th century. Leaders also supported direct sea trade with Europe, particularly England and The Netherlands, which sought Persian carpet, silk, and textiles. Other exports were horses, goat hair, pearls, and an inedible bitter almond hadam-talka used as a spice in India. The main imports were spice, textiles (woolens from Europe, cotton from Gujarat), metals, coffee, and sugar. Despite their demise in 1722, the Safavids left their mark by establishing and spreading Shi'a Islam in major parts of the Caucasus and West Asia.

=== Uzbeks and Afghan Pashtuns ===
{{Main|Uzbeks|Pashtun people}}
In the 16th to early 18th centuries, [[Central Asia]] was under the rule of [[Uzbeks]], and the far eastern portions were ruled by the local [[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]]. Between the 15th and 16th centuries, various nomadic tribes arrived from the steppes, including the [[Kipchak people|Kipchaks]], [[Naymans]], [[Kanglis]], [[Khongirad]], and [[Manguds]]. These groups were led by [[Muhammad Shaybani]], who was the [[Khan (title)|Khan]] of the Uzbeks.

The lineage of the [[Afghan (name)|Afghan]] Pashtuns stretches back to the [[Hotaki]] dynasty.&lt;ref name="US State Dept"&gt;[http://dosfan.lib.uic.edu/ERC/bgnotes/sa/afghanistan9407.html Afghanistan: History], ''U.S. Department of State'' (retrieved 10 October 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Following Muslim Arab and Turkic conquests, Pashtun ''[[Ghazw|ghazis]]'' (warriors for the faith) invaded and conquered much of northern India during the [[Lodhi dynasty]] and [[Suri dynasty]]. Pashtun forces also invaded Persia, and the opposing forces were defeated in [[the Battle of Gulnabad]]. The Pashtuns later formed the [[Durrani Empire]].

The beginning of the early modern period is not clear-cut, but is generally accepted as in the late 15th century or early 16th century. Significant dates in this transitional phase from medieval to early modern Europe can be noted:
* 1415 – [[Battle of Ceuta|Conquest of Ceuta]] by the [[Portugal|Portuguese]]
* 1444 – [[Johannes Gutenberg]]'s [[Movable type]]
* 1453 – Conquest of [[Constantinople]] by the [[Ottomans]]

* 1543 — [[Nicolaus Copernicus]]'s ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium|De revolutionibus]]''
* 1545 – [[Council of Trent]] is convened
* 1648 – [[Peace of Westphalia]] ends the [[Thirty Years War]].
|}

This era in [[Western Europe]] is referred to as the [[early modern Europe]]an period and includes the [[Protestant Reformation]], the [[European wars of religion]], the [[Age of Discovery]] and the beginning of [[European colonialism]], the rise of strong centralized governments, the beginnings of recognizable [[nation-state]]s that are the direct antecedents of today's states, the [[Age of Enlightenment]], and from the associated [[Science in the Age of Enlightenment|scientific advances]] the first phase of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The emergence of cultural and political dominance of the [[Western world]] during this period is known as the [[Great Divergence]].

The early modern period is taken to end with the [[French Revolution]], the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and the dissolution of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] at the [[Congress of Vienna]].
At the end of the early modern period, the [[Second British Empire|British]] and [[Russian Empire|Russian]] empires had emerged as world powers from the multipolar contest of [[colonial empires]], while the three great [[Asia]]n empires of the early modern period, [[stagnation of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turkey]], [[Mughal Empire#Decline|Mughal India]] and [[Qing China#Reigns of the Yongzheng and Qianlong emperors|Qing China]], all entered a period of stagnation or decline.

=== Renaissance and "early modern" ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}
The expression "early modern" is at times incorrectly used as a substitute for the term [[Renaissance]]. However, "Renaissance" is properly used in relation to a diverse series of cultural developments that occurred over several hundred years in many different parts of Europe — especially central and northern [[Italy]] — and it spans the transition from late [[medieval]] civilization to the opening of the early modern period. In the visual arts and architecture, the term 'early modern' is not a common designation as the Renaissance period is clearly distinct from what came later. Only in the study of literature is the early modern period a standard designation. European music of the period is generally divided between [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] and [[Baroque music|Baroque]]. Similarly, philosophy is divided between [[Renaissance philosophy]] and [[the Enlightenment]]. In other fields, there is far more continuity through the period such as [[gunpowder warfare|warfare]] and [[History of science|science]].

==== Gunpowder and Firearms ====
When gunpowder was introduced to Europe, it was immediately used almost exclusively in weapons and explosives for warfare. Though it was invented in China, gunpowder arrived in Europe already formulated for military use and European countries took advantage of it and were the first to create the classic firearms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The advances made in gunpowder and firearms was directly tied to the decline in the use of plate armor because of the inability of the armor to protect one from bullets.

=== European kingdoms and movements ===
In the early modern period, the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was a union of territories in Central Europe under a [[Holy Roman Emperor]] the first of which was [[Otto I]]. The last was [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]], who [[abdication|abdicated]] and dissolved the Empire in 1806 during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Despite its name, for much of its history the Empire did not include Rome within its borders.

The [[Renaissance]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=renaissance&amp;searchmode=none|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a cultural movement that spanned roughly the 14th to the 17th century, beginning in Italy in the [[Late Middle Ages]] and later spreading to the rest of Europe. The term is also used more loosely to refer to the historic [[era]], but since the changes of the Renaissance were not uniform across Europe, this is a general use of the term. As a cultural movement, it encompassed a rebellion of learning based on [[Classical antiquity|classical]] sources, the development of linear [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] in painting, and gradual but widespread [[History of education|educational]] reform.

==== Notable individuals ====
[[File:Press -Bettman.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;Gutenberg reviewing a press proof (a colored engraving created probably in the 19th century)&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Johannes Gutenberg]] is credited as the first European to use [[movable type]] [[printing]], around 1439, and as the global inventor of the mechanical [[printing press]]. [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] formulated a comprehensive [[heliocentrism|heliocentric]] [[cosmology]] (1543), which displaced the [[Earth]] from the center of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;A Greek mathematician, [[Aristarchus of Samos]], had already discussed heliocentric hypotheses as early as the third century BCE. However, there is little evidence that he ever developed his ideas beyond a very basic outline [[#Reference-Dreyer-1953|(Dreyer, 1953]], [https://archive.org/stream/historyofplaneta00dreyuoft#page/134/mode/2up pp.135–48]; [[#Reference-Linton-2004|Linton, 2004, p. 39)]].&lt;/ref&gt; His book, ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' (''On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres'') began modern [[astronomy]] and sparked the [[Scientific Revolution]]. Another notable individual was [[Machiavelli]], an Italian political philosopher, considered a founder of modern [[political science]]. Machiavelli is most famous for a short political treatise, [[The Prince]], a work of [[Political realism|realist]] [[political theory]].

Among the notable royalty of the time, [[Charles the Bold]], known as ''Charles the Bold (or Rash)'' to his enemies,&lt;ref&gt;The title was derived from his savage behavior against his enemies, and particularly from a war with France in late 1471: frustrated by the refusal of the French to engage in open battle, and angered by French attacks on his unprotected borders in Hainault and Flanders, Charles marched his army back from the Ile-de-France to Burgundian territory, burning over two thousand towns, villages and castles on his way—Taylor, Aline S. ''Isabel of Burgundy''. Lanham, Md: Madison Books, c2001, pp. 212–213&lt;/ref&gt; he was the last [[House of Valois|Valois]] [[Duke of Burgundy]], and his early death was a pivotal, if under-recognized, moment in European history. Charles has often been regarded as the last representative of the feudal spirit — a man who possessed no other quality than a blind bravery. Upon his death, Charles left an unmarried nineteen-year-old daughter, [[Mary of Burgundy]], as his heir. Her marriage would have enormous implications for the political balance of Europe. The Habsburg Emperor secured the match for his son, the future [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]], with the aid of Mary's stepmother, Margaret. In 1477, the territory of the [[Duchy of Burgundy]] was annexed by France. In the same year, Mary married Maximilian, [[Archduke of Austria]], giving the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburgs]] control of the remainder of the [[Burgundian Inheritance]].

[[Claude de Lorraine]] was the first [[Duke of Guise]], from 1528 to his death. Claude distinguished himself at the [[battle of Marignano]] (1515), and was long in recovering from the twenty-two wounds he received in the battle. In 1521, he fought at [[Fuenterrabia]], and [[Louise of Savoy]] ascribed the capture of the place to his efforts. In 1523 he became governor of [[Champagne (province)|Champagne]] and [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], after defeating at [[Neufchâteau, Vosges|Neufchâteau]] the [[Holy Roman Empire|imperial]] troops who had invaded this province. In 1525 he destroyed the [[Anabaptist]] [[German Peasants' War|peasant army]], which was overrunning [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]], at [[Lupstein]], near [[Saverne]] (Zabern). On the return of Francis I from captivity in 1528, Claude was made Duke of Guise in the [[peerage of France]], though up to this time only princes of the royal house had held the title of duke and peer of France. The Guises, as cadets of the sovereign house of Lorraine and descendants of the [[House of Valois-Anjou|house of Anjou]], claimed precedence of the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] princes of [[Prince of Condé|Condé]] and [[Prince of Conti|Conti]].

The [[Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|3rd Duke of Alba]] was a nobleman of importance in the early modern period, nicknamed the "Iron Duke" by the Protestants of the [[Low Countries]] because of his harsh rule and cruelty. Tales of atrocities committed during his military operations in [[Flanders]] became part of Dutch and English folklore, forming a central component of the [[Black Legend]].

In England, [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] was the [[King of England]] and a significant figure in the history of the [[English monarchy]]. Although in the greater part of his reign he brutally suppressed the influence of the [[Protestant Reformation]] in England,&lt;ref&gt;''See [[William Tyndale|''Martyrdom of William Tyndale''.]]&lt;/ref&gt; a movement having some roots with [[John Wycliffe]] in the 14th century, he is more popularly known for his political struggles with [[Roman Catholic Church|Rome]]. These struggles ultimately led to the separation of the [[Church of England]] from papal authority, the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]], and establishing himself as the [[Supreme Head of the Church of England]]. Though Henry reportedly became a Protestant on his death-bed, he advocated Catholic ceremony and doctrine throughout his life. Royal support for the [[English Reformation]] began with his heirs, the devout [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] and the renowned [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], whilst daughter [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] temporarily reinstated papal authority over England. Henry also oversaw the legal union of England and [[Wales]] with the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542]]. He is also noted for his [[Wives of Henry VIII|six wives]], two of whom were [[Decapitation|beheaded]].

=== Christians and Christendom ===
{{Main|History of Christianity|Christendom}}

Christianity was challenged at the beginning of the modern period with the [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453 and later by various movements to reform the church (including Lutheran, Zwinglian, and Calvinist), followed by the [[Counter Reformation]].

==== End of the Crusades and Unity ====
[[File:Battle of Vienna 1683 11.PNG|thumb|Battle of Vienna, 12 September 1683]]

The [[Hussite Wars|Hussite Crusades]] involved the military actions against and amongst the followers of [[Jan Hus]] in [[Bohemia#Hussite Bohemia|Bohemia]] ending ultimately with the [[Battle of Grotniki]]. Also known as the Hussite Wars, they were arguably the first European war in which hand-held gunpowder weapons such as [[musket]]s made a decisive contribution. The [[Taborite]] faction of the [[Hussite]] warriors were basically infantry, and their many defeats of larger armies with heavily armored knights helped effect the infantry revolution. In totality, the Hussite Crusades were inconclusive.

The last crusade, the ''Crusade of 1456'', was organized to counter the expanding Ottoman Empire and lift the [[Siege of Belgrade (1456)|Siege of Belgrade]], and was led by [[John Hunyadi]] and [[Giovanni da Capistrano]]. The siege eventually escalated into a major battle, during which Hunyadi led a sudden counterattack that overran the Turkish camp, ultimately compelling the wounded Sultan Mehmet II to lift the siege and retreat. The siege of Belgrade has been characterized as having "decided the fate of [[Christendom]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/endmiddle/bluedot/belgrade.html Pope Calixtus III account from 1456 to the Burgundian bishop talking about the savior of Christianity at Belgrade] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413030956/http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/endmiddle/bluedot/belgrade.html |date=2009-04-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[noon bell]] ordered by [[Pope Callixtus III]] commemorates the victory throughout the [[Christian world]] to this day.

Nearly a hundred years later, the [[Peace of Augsburg]] officially ended the idea that all Christians could be united under one church. The principle of ''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]'' ("whose the region is, [it shall have] his religion") established the religious, political and geographic divisions of Christianity, and this was established in [[international law]] with the [[Treaty of Westphalia]] in 1648, which legally ended the concept of a single Christian [[hegemony]], i.e. the "One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church" of the [[Nicene Creed]]. Each government determined the religion of their own state. Christians living in states where their denomination was ''not'' the established church were guaranteed the right to practice their faith in public during allotted hours and in private at their will. With the Treaty of Westphalia, the [[European wars of religion|Wars of Religion]] came to an end, and in the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] of 1713 the concept of the [[national sovereignty|sovereign national state]] was born. The ''Corpus Christianum'' has since existed with the modern idea of a tolerant and diverse society consisting of many different communities.

==== Inquisitions and Reformations ====
{{Main|Spanish Inquisition|Protestant Reformation|Inquisition|Catholic Reformation}}

The modern [[Inquisition]] refers to any one of several institutions charged with trying and convicting [[Christian heresy|heretics]] (or other offenders against [[canon law]]) within the Catholic Church. In the modern era, the first manifestation was the [[Spanish Inquisition]] of 1478 to 1834.&lt;ref name="fordhaminquisition"&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/inquisition1.html Medieval Sourcebook: Inquisition – Introduction]&lt;/ref&gt; The Inquisition prosecuted individuals accused of a wide array of crimes related to heresy, including [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]],&lt;ref&gt;this also includes [[Maleficium (sorcery)|black magic (Maleficium)]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[blasphemy]], [[Judaizing]] and [[witchcraft]], as well for [[censorship]] of printed literature. Because of its objective — combating heresy — the Inquisition had jurisdiction only over baptized members of the Church (which, however, encompassed the vast majority of the population in Catholic countries). Secular courts could still try non-Christians for blasphemy (most of the [[witch trials]] went through secular courts).

The [[Protestant Reformation]] and rise of [[modernity]] in the early 16th century entailed the start of a series of changes in the ''[[Corpus Christianum]]''. [[Martin Luther]] challenged the Catholic Church with his [[Ninety-Five Theses]], generally accepted as the beginning of the Reformation, a Christian reform movement in Europe, though precursors such as [[Jan Hus]] predate him. The Protestant movement of the 16th century occurred under the protection of the [[Electorate of Saxony]], an independent hereditary [[Prince-elector|electorate]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The Elector [[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony|Frederick III]] established a [[Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg|university at Wittenberg]] in 1502. The [[Augustinian monk]] Martin Luther became professor of philosophy there in 1508. At the same time, he became one of the preachers at the castle church of Wittenberg.

On 31 October 1517, Luther posted his ''Ninety-Five Theses'' on the door of the [[All Saints' Church, Wittenberg|All Saints' Church]], which served as a notice board for university-related announcements.&lt;ref name="Simon-120-121"&gt;{{cite book |first=Edith |last=Simon |title=Great Ages of Man: The Reformation |pages=120–121 |publisher=Time-Life Books |year=1966 |isbn=0-662-27820-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were points for debate that criticized the Church and the Pope. The most controversial points centered on the practice of selling [[indulgence]]s (especially by [[Johann Tetzel]]) and the Church's policy on [[purgatory]]. The reform movement soon split along certain doctrinal lines. Religious disagreements between various leading figures led to the emergence of rival Protestant churches. The most important [[Christian denomination|denominations]] to emerge directly from the Reformation were the [[Lutheran]]s, and the [[Reformed]]/[[Calvinist]]s/[[Presbyterian]]s. The process of reform had decidedly different causes and effects in other countries. In England, where it gave rise to [[Anglicanism]], the period became known as the [[English Reformation]]. Subsequent Protestant denominations generally trace their roots back to the initial reforming movements.

The [[Diet of Worms]] in 1521, presided by Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], declared Martin Luther a heretic and an outlaw (although Charles V  was more preoccupied with maintaining his vast empire than with arresting Luther). As a result of Charles V's distractions in East Europe and in Spain, he agreed through the [[Diet of Speyer (1526)|Diet of Speyer]] in 1526 to allow German princes to effectively decide themselves whether to enforce the Edict of Worms or not, for the time being. After returning to the empire, Charles V attended the [[Diet of Augsburg]] in 1530 to order all Protestants in the empire to revert to Catholicism. In response, the Protestant territories in and around Germany formed the [[Schmalkaldic League]] to fight against the Catholic Holy Roman Empire. Charles V left again to handle the advance of the Ottoman Turks. He returned in 1547 to launch a military campaign against the Schmalkaldic League and to issue an imperial law requiring all Protestants to return to Catholic practices (with a few superficial concessions to Protestant practices). Warfare ended when Charles V relented in the [[Peace of Passau]] (1552) and in the [[Peace of Augsburg]] (1555), which formalized the law that the rulers of a land decide its religion.

Of the late Inquisitions in the modern era, there were two different manifestations:&lt;ref name="fordhaminquisition" /&gt;
# the [[Portuguese Inquisition]] (1536–1821)
# the [[Roman Inquisition]] (1542 – c.1860)
This Portuguese inquisition was a local analogue of the more famous Spanish Inquisition. The Roman Inquisition covered most of the [[Italian peninsula]] as well as [[Malta]] and also existed in isolated pockets of papal jurisdiction in other parts of Europe, including [[Avignon]].

The [[Catholic Reformation]] began in 1545 when the [[Council of Trent]] was called in reaction to the ''Protestant Rebellion''. The idea was to reform the state of worldliness and disarray that had befallen some of the [[Catholic clergy|clergy of the Church]], while reaffirming the spiritual authority of the Catholic Church and its position as the sole true [[Church of Christ]] on Earth. The effort sought to prevent further damage to the Church and her faithful at the hands of the newly formed [[Protestant denomination]]s.

==== Tsardom of Russia ====
{{Main|Tsardom of Russia}}

In development of the [[Third Rome]] ideas, the Grand Duke [[Ivan IV]] (the "Awesome"&lt;ref&gt;Frank D. McConnell. [https://books.google.com/books?id=rqhZAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22ivan+the+awesome%22 Storytelling and Mythmaking: Images from Film and Literature.] [[Oxford University Press]], 1979.  {{ISBN|0-19-502572-5}}; Quote from page 78: "But Ivan IV, Ivan the Terrible, or as the Russian has it, ''Ivan Groznyi'', "Ivan the Magnificent" or "Ivan the Awesome," is precisely a man who has become a legend"&lt;/ref&gt; or "the Terrible") was officially crowned the first [[Tsar]] ("[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]") of Russia in 1547. The Tsar promulgated a new code of laws ([[Sudebnik of 1550]]), established the first Russian feudal representative body ([[Zemsky Sobor]]) and introduced local self-management into the rural regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Solovyov, S.|title=History of Russia from the Earliest Times|publisher=AST|year=2001|pages=562–604|volume=6|isbn=5-17-002142-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Skrynnikov, R.|title=Ivan the Terrible|publisher=Academic Intl Pr|year=1981|page=219|isbn=0-87569-039-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his long reign, Ivan IV nearly doubled the already large Russian territory by annexing the three Tatar khanates (parts of disintegrated [[Golden Horde]]): [[Khanate of Kazan|Kazan]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate|Astrakhan]] along the Volga River, and [[Sibirean Khanate]] in South Western Siberia. Thus by the end of the 16th century Russia was transformed into a [[multiethnic]], multiconfessional and [[transcontinental state]].

=== Discovery and trade ===
[[File:Cantino Planisphere.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Cantino planisphere]] (1502), the oldest surviving Portuguese nautical chart showing the results of the explorations of [[Vasco da Gama]] to India, [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] to Central America, [[Gaspar Corte-Real]] to Newfoundland and [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] to Brazil. The meridian of [[Tordesillas]], separating the Portuguese and Spanish halves of the world is also depicted]]
The [[Age of Discovery]] was a period from the early 15th century and continuing into the early 17th century, during which European ships traveled around the world to search for new trading routes and partners to feed burgeoning capitalism in Europe. They also were in search of trading goods such as gold, silver and [[spices]]. In the process, Europeans encountered peoples and mapped lands previously unknown to them. This factor in the early European modern period was a [[proto-globalization|globalizing]] character; the 'discovery' of the Americas and the rise of sustained contacts between previously isolated parts of the globe was an important historical event.

The search for new routes was based on the fact that the [[Silk Road]] was controlled by the Ottoman Empire, which was an impediment to European commercial interests, and other Eastern trade routes were not available to the Europeans due to Muslim control. The ability to outflank the Muslim states of North Africa was seen as crucial to European survival. At the same time, the Iberians learnt much from their Arab neighbors. The northwestern region of [[Eurasia]] has a very long coastline, and has arguably been more influenced by its ''[[maritime history]]'' than any other continent. Europe is uniquely situated between several navigable seas, and intersected by navigable rivers running into them in a way that greatly facilitated the influence of maritime traffic and commerce. In the [[maritime history of Europe]], the carrack and caravel both incorporated the [[lateen sail]] that made ships far more maneuverable. By translating the Arab versions of lost [[History of geography#Greco-Roman world|ancient Greek geographical works]] into Latin, European navigators acquired a deeper knowledge of the shape of Africa and Asia.

==== Mercantile capitalism ====
{{Main|Mercantilism|Merchant capitalism}}

[[Mercantilism]] was the dominant school of economic thought throughout the early modern period (from the 16th to the 18th century). This led to some of the first instances of significant government intervention and control over the economy, and it was during this period that much of the modern capitalist system was established. Internationally, mercantilism encouraged the many European wars of the period and fueled European imperialism. Belief in mercantilism began to fade in the late 18th century, as the arguments of Adam Smith and the other classical economists won out.

The [[Commercial Revolution]] was a period of economic expansion, [[colonialism]], and mercantilism that lasted from approximately the 16th century until the early 18th century. Beginning with the [[Crusades]], Europeans rediscovered spices, silks, and other commodities rare in Europe. This development created a new desire for trade, which expanded in the second half of the [[Middle Ages]]. European nations, through [[Age of Discovery|voyages of discovery]], were looking for new trade routes in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, which allowed the European powers to build vast, new [[international trade]] networks. Nations also sought new sources of wealth. To deal with this new-found wealth, new economic theories and practices were created. Because of competing national interest, nations had the desire for increased world power through their colonial empires. The Commercial Revolution is marked by an increase in general commerce, and in the growth of non-manufacturing pursuits, such as banking, insurance, and investing.

===== Trade and the New Economy =====
In the [[Old World]], the most desired trading goods were gold, silver, and [[spice]]s. Western Europeans used the [[compass]], new [[sailing ship]] technologies, new maps, and advances in astronomy to seek a viable [[trade route]] to Asia for valuable spices that Mediterranean powers could not contest.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In terms of shipping advances, the most important developments were the creation of the [[carrack]] and [[caravel]] designs in [[Portugal]]. These vessels evolved from [[post-classical age|medieval]] European designs from the North Sea and both the Christian and Islamic Mediterranean. They were the first ships that could leave the relatively placid and calm [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] or [[North Sea]] and sail safely on the open [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]].

When the [[carrack]] and then the [[caravel]] were developed in [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]], European thoughts returned to the fabled East. These explorations have a number of causes. [[Monetarists]] believe the main reason the Age of Exploration began was because of a severe shortage of [[bullion]] in Europe. The European economy was dependent on gold and silver currency, but low domestic supplies had plunged much of Europe into a recession. Another factor was the centuries-long conflict between the Iberians and the Muslims to the south.

===== Piracy's Golden Age =====
{{Main|Golden Age of Piracy}}

The [[Golden Age of Piracy]] is a designation given to one or more outbursts of [[piracy]] in the early modern period, spanning from the mid-17th century to the mid-18th century. The [[Golden Age of Piracy#The buccaneering period, c. 1650–1680|buccaneering period]] covers approximately the late 17th century. The period is characterized by Anglo-French seamen based on Jamaica and Tortuga attacking Spanish colonies and shipping in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific. A sailing route known as the [[Pirate Round]] was followed by certain Anglo-American pirates at the turn of the 18th century, associated with long-distance voyages from Bermuda and the Americas to rob Muslim and East India Company targets in the Indian Ocean and Red Sea. The post-Spanish Succession period extending into the early 18th century, when Anglo-American sailors and privateers left unemployed by the end of the War of the Spanish Succession turned en masse to piracy in the Caribbean, the American eastern seaboard, the West African coast, and the Indian Ocean.

==== European states and politics ====
The 15th to 18th century period is marked by the first European colonies, the rise of strong centralized governments, and the beginnings of recognizable European nation states that are the direct antecedents of today's states.  Although the Renaissance included revolutions in many [[intellectual]] pursuits, as well as social and political upheaval, it is perhaps best known for European artistic developments and the contributions of such [[polymath]]s as [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Michelangelo]], who inspired the term "[[Polymath|Renaissance man]]".&lt;ref&gt;BBC Science &amp; Nature, ''[http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/leonardo/ Leonardo da Vinci]'' (Retrieved on May 12, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BBC History, ''[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/michelangelo.shtml Michelangelo]'' (Retrieved on May 12, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Baroque]] period the [[Thirty Years' War]] in Central Europe decimated the population by up to 20%. In 1648, the [[Peace of Westphalia]], consisting of the [[Peace treaty|treaties]] of [[Osnabrück]] and [[Münster]], signed on May 15 and October 24, respectively, ended several wars in Europe and established the beginning of [[sovereign state]]s. The treaties involved the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand III]] ([[Habsburg]]), the Kingdoms of Spain, France and [[Sweden]], the [[Dutch Republic|Netherlands]] and their respective allies among the [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|princes]] and the [[Free Imperial City|Republican Imperial States]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

The Peace of Westphalia resulted from the first modern [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]] congress.  Until 1806, the regulations became part of the constitutional laws of the Holy Roman Empire.  The [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]], signed in 1659, ended the [[war]] between France and Spain and is often considered part of the overall accord.

===== Absolutism =====
The [[Age of Absolutism]] describes the [[monarch]]ical power that was unrestrained by any other institutions, such as churches, [[legislature]]s, or [[social elite]]s of the [[European monarch]]s during the transition from [[feudalism]] to capitalism. Monarchs described as absolute can especially be found in the 17th century through the 19th century. Nations that adopted Absolutism include France, Prussia, and Russia. Nobles tended to trade privileges for allegiance throughout the eighteenth century, so that the interests of the nobility aligned with that of the crown. Absolutism is characterized by the ending of feudal partitioning, consolidation of power with the monarch, rise of [[Political power|state power]], unification of the [[state law]]s, drastic increase in tax revenue collected by the monarch, and a decrease in the influence of [[nobility]].

===== French power =====
For much of the reign of [[Louis XIV]], who was known as the ''Sun King'' (French: ''le Roi Soleil''), France stood as the leading power in Europe, engaging in three major [[war]]s—the [[Franco-Dutch War]], the [[Nine Years War|War of the League of Augsburg]], and the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]—and two minor conflicts—the [[War of Devolution]], and the [[War of the Reunions]]. Louis believed in the [[Divine Right of Kings]], the theory that the King was crowned by God and accountable to him alone. Consequently, he has long been considered the archetypal [[Absolute monarchy|absolute monarch]]. Louis XIV continued the work of his predecessor to create a [[Centralized government|centralized state]], governed from the capital to sweep away the remnants of [[feudalism]] that persisted in parts of France. He succeeded in breaking the power of the provincial nobility, much of which had risen in revolt during his minority called the Fronde, and forced many leading nobles to live with him in his lavish [[Palace of Versailles]].

Men who featured prominently in the political and military life of France during this period include [[Cardinal Mazarin|Mazarin]], [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]], [[Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, Vicomte de Turenne|Turenne]], [[Vauban]]. French culture likewise flourished during this era, producing a number of figures of great renown, including [[Molière]], [[Jean Racine|Racine]], [[Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux|Boileau]], [[Jean de La Fontaine|La Fontaine]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lully|Lully]], [[Charles Le Brun|Le Brun]], [[Hyacinthe Rigaud|Rigaud]], [[Louis Le Vau]], [[Jules Hardouin Mansart]], [[Claude Perrault]] and [[André Le Nôtre|Le Nôtre]].

===== Early English revolutions =====
Before the Age of Revolution, the [[English Civil War]] was a series of armed conflicts and political machinations between Parliamentarians and Royalists. The first and second civil wars pitted the supporters of King Charles I against the supporters of the Long Parliament, while the third war saw fighting between supporters of King Charles II and supporters of the Rump Parliament. The Civil War ended with the Parliamentary victory at the Battle of Worcester. The monopoly of the Church of England on Christian worship in England ended with the victors consolidating the established Protestant Ascendancy in Ireland. Constitutionally, the wars established the precedent that an English monarch cannot govern without Parliament's consent. The [[English Restoration]], or simply put as the Restoration, began in 1660 when the English, Scottish and Irish monarchies were all restored under Charles II after the Commonwealth of England that followed the English Civil War. The [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 establishes modern [[parliamentary democracy]] in England.

===== International balance of power =====
The [[War of the Spanish Succession]] was a war fought between 1701 and 1714, in which several European powers combined to stop a possible unification of the Kingdoms of Spain and France under a single Bourbon monarch, upsetting the European [[Balance of power in international relations|balance of power]]. It was fought mostly in Europe, but it included [[Queen Anne's War]] in North America.  The war was marked by the military leadership of notable generals like the [[Claude-Louis-Hector de Villars|duc de Villars]], the Jacobite [[James FitzJames, 1st Duke of Berwick-upon-Tweed|Duke of Berwick]], the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]] and [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]].

The [[Peace of Utrecht]] established after a series of individual [[peace treaty|peace treaties]] signed in the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] city of [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] concluded between various European states helped end the War of the Spanish Succession. The representatives who met were Louis XIV of France and [[Philip V of Spain]] on the one hand, and representatives of Queen [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]] of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], the [[Duchy of Savoy|Duke of Savoy]], and the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] on the other. The treaty enregistred the defeat of French ambitions expressed in the wars of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] and preserved the European system based on the [[Balance of power in international relations|balance of power]].&lt;ref&gt;R.R. Palmer, ''A History of the Modern World'' 2nd ed. 1961, p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Treaty of Utrecht]] marked the change from [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] naval supremacy.

== New World and Americas ==
{{Main|Colonialism|History of colonialism|New World}}
[[File:colonisation2.gif|thumb|center|upright=2.75|World Colonization of 1492 (Early Modern World), 1550, 1660, 1754 (Age of Enlightenment), 1822 (Industrial revolution), 1885 (European Hegemony), 1914 (World War I era), 1938 (World War II era), 1959 (Cold War era) and 1974 (Recent history).]]
The term ''colonialism'' is normally used with reference to discontiguous overseas empires rather than contiguous land-based empires, European or otherwise. European colonisation during the 15th to 19th centuries resulted in the spread of Christianity to [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], the Americas, Australia and the [[Philippines]].

=== Conquest and Americas exploration ===

{{Main|Spanish colonization of the Americas|Portuguese colonization of the Americas}}
[[Christopher Columbus]] discovered the Americas in 1492. Subsequently, the major sea powers in Europe sent expeditions to the [[New World]] to build trade networks and colonies and to convert the native peoples to Christianity. [[Pope Alexander VI]] divided newly discovered lands outside Europe between Spain and Portugal along a north-south meridian 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde islands (off the west coast of Africa). The division was never accepted by the rulers of England or France. (See also the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], which followed the papal decree.)

=== Colonial Latin America ===
{{See also|New Spain|Spanish empire|Colonial Brazil}}

What is now called [[Latin America]], a designation first used in the late 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;José C. Moya, ed. ''The Oxford Handbook of Latin America''. New York: Oxford University Press 2011&lt;/ref&gt; was claimed by Spain and Portugal. The Western Hemisphere, the [[New World]],&lt;ref&gt;There is no known human evolution in the Western Hemisphere so all humans came on foot or boat to the vast new area.&lt;/ref&gt; was divided between the two Iberian powers by the Treaty of Tordesillas in what until the late 16th-century, was an area that could be called "Ibero-America." Spain called its overseas empire there "The Indies," with Portugal calling its territory in South America [[Brazil]], after the dyewood found there. Spain concentrated building its empire where there were large indigenous populations, "Indians," who could be compelled to work and large deposits of precious metals, mainly silver. Both [[New Spain]] (colonial Mexico) and [[Peru]] fit those criteria and the Spanish crown established [[viceroyalties]] to rule those two large areas. As Spanish settlements and the economy grew in size and complexity, the Spanish established viceroyalties in the eighteenth century during [[Bourbon reforms|administrative reforms]] Rio de la Plata (southeastern South America) and New Granada (northern South America).

Initially, Portuguese settlements (Brazil) in the coastal northeast were of lesser importance in the larger Portuguese overseas empire, where lucrative commerce and small settlements devoted to trade were established in coastal Africa, India and China. With sparse indigenous populations that could not be coerced to work and no known deposits of precious metals, Portugal sought a high-value, low-bulk export product and found it in [[sugarcane]].  Black African slave labour from Portugal's West African possessions was imported to do the grueling agricultural work. As the wealth of the Ibero-America increased, some Western European powers (Dutch, French, British, Danish) sought to duplicate the model in areas that the Iberians had not settled in numbers. They seized Caribbean islands from the Spanish and transferred the model of sugar production on plantations with slave labour and settled in northern areas of North America in what are now the Eastern Seaboard of the United States and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Lockhart (historian)|James Lockhart]] and [[Stuart B. Schwartz]], ''Early Latin America''. New York: Cambridge University Press 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Colonial North America ===
{{See also|New Spain|New France|New Netherland|Colonial history of the United States|Canada under British rule}}

North America outside the zone of Spanish settlement was a contested area in the 17th century. Spain had founded small settlements in Florida and Georgia but nowhere near the size of those in [[New Spain]] or the Caribbean islands. France, The Netherlands, and Great Britain held several colonies in North America and the West Indies from the 17th century, 100 years after the Spanish and Portuguese established permanent colonies. The British colonies in North America were founded between 1607 (Virginia) and 1733 (Georgia). The Dutch explored the east coast of North America and began founding settlements in what they called [[New Netherland]] (now [[New York State]].). France colonized what is now [[Eastern Canada]], founding [[Quebec City]] in 1608. France's loss in the [[Seven Years' War]] resulted in the transfer of [[New France]] to [[Great Britain]]. The [[Thirteen Colonies]], in lower British North America, rebelled against British rule in 1775, largely due to the taxation that Great Britain was imposing on the colonies. The British colonies in Canada remained loyal to the crown, and a provisional government formed by the Thirteen Colonies proclaimed their independence on July 4, 1776 and subsequently became the original 13 United States of America. With the 1783 Treaty of Paris ending the [[American Revolutionary War]], Britain recognised the former Thirteen Colonies' independence.

==Atlantic World==
{{see also|Atlantic history}}
[[File:Waldseemuller map 2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Waldseemüller map]] with joint sheets, 1507]]
A recent development in early modern history is the creation of [[Atlantic World]] as a category. The term generally encompasses western Europe, West Africa, North and South and America and the Caribbean islands. It seeks to show both local and regional development and the connections between the various geographical regions.

== Religious trends and philosophy ==
{{further|History of religion|History of philosophy}}

=== Eastern philosophies ===
Concerning the [[history of Philosophy|development of Eastern philosophies]], much of [[Eastern philosophy]] had been in an advanced state of development from study in the previous centuries. The various [[philosophy|philosophies]] include [[Indian philosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;Of note in modern Indian philosophy are the philosophers who gave contemporary meaning to traditional philosophy, such as [[Swami Vivekananda]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chinese philosophy]], [[Iranian philosophy]], [[Japanese philosophy]], and [[Korean philosophy]].

=== Muslim world ===
The [[Islamic Golden Age]] reached its peak in the [[High Middle Ages]], stopped short by the [[Mongol invasions]] of the 13th century. The re-establishment of three major Muslim empires by the 16th century (the aforementioned [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Safavid Empire|Safavid]] and [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Empires) gave rise to a Muslim cultural revival.{{Clarify|date=July 2011}} The [[Safavids]] [[Safavid conversion of Iran to Shia Islam|established]] [[Twelver Shi'a Islam]] as Iran's official religion, thus giving [[Iran]] a separate identity from its [[Sunni]] neighbors.

=== Protestant Reformation ===
{{Main|Protestant theology}}

The early modern period was initiated by the [[Protestant Reformation]] and the collapse of the unity of the medieval [[Roman Catholic Church|Western Church]].
The theology of [[Calvinism]] in particular has been argued as instrumental to the rise of [[capitalism]] (''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'').

=== Counter-Reformation and Jesuits ===
{{Main|Counter-Reformation}}
The Counter-Reformation was a period of [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] revival in response to the [[Protestant Reformation]] during the mid-16th to mid-17th centuries. The Counter-Reformation was a comprehensive effort, involving ecclesiastical or structural reforms as well as a political dimension and spiritual movements.

Such reforms included the foundation of [[seminaries]] for the proper training of priests in the spiritual life and the theological traditions of the Church, the reform of religious life by returning orders to their spiritual foundations and new spiritual movements focusing on the devotional life and a personal relationship with [[Christ]], including the [[Spanish mystics]] and the [[French school of spirituality]]. It also involved political activities that included the [[Roman Inquisition]].

New religious orders were a fundamental part of this trend. Orders such as the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchins]], [[Ursulines]], [[Theatines]], [[Discalced Carmelites]], the [[Barnabites]], and especially the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] strengthened rural parishes, improved popular piety, helped to curb corruption within the church and set examples that would be a strong impetus for Catholic renewal.

=== Humanism ===
{{Main|Humanism}}
{{further|Erasmus}}
With the adoption of large-scale printing after 1500, Italian [[Renaissance Humanism]] spread northward to France, Germany, Holland and England, where it became associated with the [[Protestant Reformation]]. In France, pre-eminent Humanist [[Guillaume Budé]] (1467–1540) applied the [[philology|philological]] methods of Italian Humanism to the study of antique coinage and to legal history, composing a detailed commentary on [[Corpus Juris Civilis|Justinian's Code]]. Although a royal absolutist (and not a republican like the early Italian ''umanisti''), Budé was active in civic life, serving as a diplomat for [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] and helping to found the [[Collège de France|Collège des Lecteurs Royaux]] (later the Collège de France). Meanwhile, [[Marguerite de Navarre]], the sister of Francis I, herself a poet, novelist and religious mystic,&lt;ref&gt;She was the author of ''Miroir de l'ame pecheresse'' (''The Mirror of a Sinful Soul''), published after her death, among other devotional poetry. See also "Marguerite de Navarre: Religious Reformist" in Jonathan A. Reid, [http://www.brill.nl/print.aspx?partid=210&amp;pid=18212  ''King's sister—queen of dissent: Marguerite of Navarre (1492–1549) and her evangelical network''] {{dead link|date=October 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} (''Studies in medieval and Reformation traditions, 1573–4188''; v. 139). Leiden; Boston: Brill, 2009. (2 v.: (xxii, 795 p.) {{ISBN|978-90-04-17760-4}} (v. 1), 9789004177611 (v. 2)&lt;/ref&gt; gathered around her and protected a circle of vernacular poets and writers, including [[Clément Marot]], [[Pierre de Ronsard]] and [[François Rabelais]].

=== 17th-century philosophy ===
{{Main|17th-century philosophy}}
The philosophy of 17th-century Europe marks the departure from medieval [[scholasticism]] and the often [[Renaissance magic|occultist]] approach of [[Renaissance philosophy]].
The period was typified in Europe by the great system-builders, philosophers who presented unified systems of [[epistemology]], [[metaphysics]], [[logic]], and [[ethics]] and often [[politics]] and the [[physical sciences]] as well.

[[Immanuel Kant]] classified his predecessors into two schools: the [[Rationalism|rationalists]] and the [[Empiricism|empiricists]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/k/kantmeta.htm#H1|title=Kant, Immanuel: Metaphysics – Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three main rationalists are normally taken to have been [[René Descartes]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], and [[Gottfried Leibniz]].

The first great advances towards modern science were made in the mid-17th century, most notably the theory of [[gravity]] by [[Isaac Newton]] (1643–1727). Newton, Spinoza, [[John Locke]] (1632–1704) and [[Pierre Bayle]] (1647–1706) were philosophers sparking the Age of Enlightenment in the following century.

=== Age of Reason and the scientific revolution ===
{{Main|Age of Enlightenment|Scientific revolution|Atheism in the Age of the Enlightenment|Philosophical skepticism}}
The [[Great Divergence]] is epitomized by the ''Age of Enlightenment'' (or ''Age of Reason'').
The Enlightenment, starting in the 1750s, flourished until about 1790–1800, after which the emphasis on reason gave way to [[Romanticism]]'s emphasis on emotion and a [[Counter-Enlightenment]] gained force.

The centre of the Enlightenment was France, where it was based in the salons and culminated in the great ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' (1751–1772), edited by [[Denis Diderot]] (1713–1784) with contributions by hundreds of leading [[philosophes]] (intellectuals) such as [[Voltaire]] (1694–1778) and [[Montesquieu]] (1689–1755). The French Enlightenment was received in Germany, notably fostered by [[Frederick the Great]], the [[king of Prussia]], and gave rise to a flowering of [[German philosophy]], represented foremost by [[Immanuel Kant]].

The French and German developments were further influential in [[Scottish Enlightenment|Scottish]], [[Russian Enlightenment|Russian]], [[Enlightenment in Spain|Spanish]] and [[Enlightenment in Poland|Polish]] philosophy.

== End of early period ==

[[File:Leonhard Euler World Map AD1760.jpg|thumb|right|Engraved world map (including magnetic declination lines) by [[Leonhard Euler]] from his school atlas “Geographischer Atlas bestehend in 44 Land-Charten” first published 1753 in Berlin]]
In [[modern history]], the end of the early period falls in the late 18th century, as an [[Age of Revolutions]] dawns, beginning with those in North America and France. Subsequent important political changes occurred throughout Europe, including upheavals following the Napoleonic Wars, the redrawing of the map of Europe through the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Second Treaty of Paris]], the rise of new concepts of nationalism and the reorganization in military forces. The end of the early modern period is usually also associated with the [[Industrial Revolution]], which began in Britain in the mid-18th century.

'''Environmental globalization'''  refers to the internationally coordinated practices and regulations (often in the form of [[international treaties]]) regarding [[environmental protection]].&lt;ref name="Zimmerer2006-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OosthoekGills2013-54"/&gt; An example of environmental globalization would be the series of International Tropical Timber Agreement treaties ([[International Tropical Timber Agreement, 1983|1983]], [[International Tropical Timber Agreement, 1994|1994]], [[International Tropical Timber Agreement, 2006|2006]]), establishing [[International Tropical Timber Organization]] and promoting [[sustainable management]] of [[tropical forests]]. Environmental globalization is usually supported by [[non-governmental organization]]s and governments of [[developed countries]], but opposed by governments of [[developing countries]] which see pro-environmental initiatives as hindering their economic development.

Environmental globalization is related to [[economic globalization]], as economic development on a global scale has environmental impacts on such scale, which is of concern to numerous organizations and individuals.&lt;ref name="OosthoekGills2013-54"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BenyonDunkerley2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Benyon|author2=David Dunkerley|title=Globalization: The Reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=doB9AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA54|date=1 May 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-78240-4|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; While economic globalization has environmental impacts, those impacts should not be confused with the concept of environmental globalization.&lt;ref name=Grainger&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470670590.wbeog170/abstract|title=Environmental Globalization|last=Grainger|first=Alan|date=1 January 2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|isbn=9780470670590|language=en|doi=10.1002/9780470670590.wbeog170/full}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some regards, environmental globalization is in direct opposition to economic globalization, particularly when the latter is described as encouraging trade, and the former, as promoting pro-environment initiatives that are an impediment to trade.&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-240"/&gt; For that reason, an environmental activist might be opposed to economic globalization, but advocate environmental globalization.&lt;ref name="DobratzWaldner2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Betty Dobratz|author2=Lisa K Waldner|author3=Timothy Buzzell|title=Power, Politics, and Society: An Introduction to Political Sociology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RoK9CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA346|date=14 October 2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-34529-9|page=346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Grainger has discussed that environmental globalization in the context of international agreements on pro-environmental initiatives. According to him, precursors to modern environmental globalization can be found in the [[colonial era]] [[forestry|scientific forestry]] (research into how to create and restore forests).&lt;ref name="OosthoekGills2013-57"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Grainger|chapter=Environmental Globalization and Tropical Forests|editor1=Jan Oosthoek|editor2=Barry K.

The '''European Broadcasting Area (EBA)''' is defined by the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU) as such:

:''The "European Broadcasting Area" is bounded on the west by the western boundary of [[International Telecommunication Union region|Region 1]], on the east by the [[meridian 40° East]] of [[Greenwich meridian|Greenwich]] and on the south by the [[parallel 30° North]] so as to include the northern part of [[Saudi Arabia]] and that part of those countries bordering the [[Mediterranean]] within these limits. In addition, [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and those parts of the territories of [[Iraq]], [[Jordan]], [[Syrian Arab Republic]], [[Turkey]] and [[Ukraine]] lying outside the above limits are included in the European Broadcasting Area.''&lt;ref name="ITU-R Radio Regulation 2012"&gt;[http://www.sma.gov.jm/sites/default/files/publication_files/ITU-R_Radio_Regulations_2012_%202015_%20Article_5_Table%20of%20Frequencies.pdf ITU-R Radio Regulations (2012-2015)], International Telecommunication Union, available from the Spectrum Management Authority of Jamaica. Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia were added to the EBA at the 2007 World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC-07).&lt;/ref&gt;

The EBA includes territory outside [[Europe]], and excludes some territory that is part of the European continent. For example,
[[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] were defined as outside the EBA borders until 2007.&lt;ref name="ITU-R Radio Regulation 2004"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-s/oth/02/02/S020200001A4501PDFE.pdf|title=ITU-R Radio Regulations - Articles edition of 2004 (valid in 2004-2007)|format=PDF|publisher=''[[International Telecommunication Union]]''|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; After EBA was expanded by the 2007 World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC-07) to include those three countries,&lt;ref name="ITU-R Radio Regulation 2012"/&gt; the only ITU member state with territory in Europe while remaining outside the EBA is [[Kazakhstan]]. While Kazakhstan is excluded from EBA, it is still eligible to apply for membership of the [[Member states of the Council of Europe#Applicants|Council of Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/XRef/X2H-Xref-ViewHTML.asp?FileID=9998&amp;lang=EN|title=Situation in Kazakhstan and its Relations with the Council of Europe|publisher=Parliamentary Assembly Council of Europe|work=Document 11007: II General information, point 11|date=7 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The boundaries of the European Broadcasting Area have their origin in the regions served and linked by telegraphy cables in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The European Broadcasting Area plays a part in the definition of eligibility for active membership in the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU) and thus participation in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. As of November 2017, the European Broadcasting Union has 73 members from 56 countries, 33 associates from 21 countries, and 7 approved participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ebu.ch/about/members|title=EBU - Members|publisher=European Broadcasting Union|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Fourth World''' is an extension of the [[three-world model]], used variably to refer  to
# Sub-populations socially excluded from [[global society]];
# Hunter-gatherer, nomadic, pastoral, and some subsistence farming peoples living beyond the modern industrial norm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.acpp.org/sevents/0809.html|title = International day of the world's indigenous people|work = Asian Center for the Progress of Peoples|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081204114415/http://www.acpp.org/sevents/0809.html|archivedate = 4 December 2008|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Sub-populations existing in a [[First World]] country, but with the living standards of those of a [[Third World]], or developing country.

The term is not commonly accepted. "Fourth World" has also been used to refer to other parts of the world in relation to the three-world model.

==Etymology==
''Fourth World'' follows the [[First World]], [[Second World]], and [[Third World]] classification of nation-state status; however, unlike the former categories, ''Fourth World'' is not spatially bounded, and is usually used to refer to size and shape which does not map onto citizenship in a specific nation-state. It can denote [[nation]]s without a [[sovereign state]], emphasizing the perceived non-recognition and exclusion of ethnically- and religiously-defined peoples from the politico-economic world system, such as the [[First Nations]] groups throughout North, Central and South America. Spanish [[sociologist]] [[Manuel Castells]] of the [[University of Southern California]] [[University of Southern California Annenberg School for Communication|Annenberg School for Communication]] has made extensive use of the term ''fourth world''.

==Coinage==
The term originated in Georgia with a remark by [[Mbuto Milando]], first secretary of the [[Tanzania]]n [[High Commissioner (Commonwealth)|High Commission]], in conversation with [[George Manuel]], Chief of the National Indian Brotherhood (now the [[Assembly of First Nations]]). Milando stated that "When Native peoples come into their own, on the basis of their own cultures and traditions, that will be the Fourth World."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Since publication of Manuel's ''The Fourth World: An Indian Reality'' (1974), the term ''Fourth World'' became synonymous with stateless, poor, and marginal nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cwis.org/fwdp/International/statebrk.txt | title = The breakdown of states | first = Richard | last = Griggs | publisher = [[Center for World Indigenous Studies]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 1979, think tanks such as the [[Center for World Indigenous Studies]] have used the term in defining the relationships between ancient, [[tribe|tribal]], and non-industrial nations and modern industrialised nation-states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cwis.org/fwdp/International/moscow93.txt | title = Toward the coexistence of nations and states | first = Rudolph C. | last = Ryser |date=September 1993 | publisher = [[Center for World Indigenous Studies]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the 2007 UN [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]], communications and organizing amongst Fourth World peoples have accelerated in the form of international treaties between aboriginal nations for the purposes of trade, travel, and security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.indiancountrytoday.com/archive/28202554.html | title = United League of Indigenous Nations formed | work = [[Indian Country Today]] | date = 10 August 2007 | first = Redwing | last = Cloud}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the Indian left movement, Dr. [[M. P.

The logo also was seen in the upper right and left corners at varied times. It was settled in 2007 that the logo will be seen in the upper right corner.  In 2007, GMA Pinoy TV became a huge success and was known better known because of ''[[MariMar (2007 TV series)|Marimar]]''. Due to the success of the program, GMA Pinoy TV once changed graphics, which has been used from 2007 to October 2010.

The said election coverage was aired live on GMA Pinoy TV on 9 May until the Election ended. Based on the September 2010 report posted by the Corporate Communications Department of GMA Network, GMA Pinoy TV had a total of 256,000 subscribers while its sister channel, GMA Life TV had 122,000 subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pep.ph/guide/6812/GMA-Pinoy-TV-and-GMA-Life-TV-initiate-projects-that-will-enrich-lives-of-Filipinos-abroad|title=GMA Pinoy TV and GMA Life TV initiate projects that will enrich lives of Filipinos abroad - PEP.ph: The Number One Site for Philippine Showbiz|author=PEP.ph|date=16 September 2010|work=pep.ph}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 October 2010 (otherwise known was 10-10-10), GMA Pinoy TV changed graphics with a theme that recognizes and is towards Pinoys all over the world. It also has a globe symbolizing how far GMA Pinoy TV has gone since the start. On Christmas 2010, GMA Pinoy TV used the slogan "Isang Maligayang at Masaganang Paskong Pinoy, Kapuso." This was the first time that GMA Pinoy TV used another Christmas slogan besides the GMA Network Christmas 2010 slogan, "Isang Pagkilala sa Puso ng Pilipino Ngayong Pasko." As for the 3rd Quarter of 2010, GMA Pinoy TV had around 261,000 subscribers posted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pep.ph/guide/tv/7457/gma-pinoy-tv-and-gma-life-tv-launches-10-new-locations-in-december-2010|title=GMA Pinoy TV and GMA Life TV launches 10 new locations in December 2010 - PEP.ph: The Number One Site for Philippine Showbiz|author=PEP.ph|date=12 January 2011|work=pep.ph}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2010, GMA Pinoy TV and GMA Life TV has expanded into the following: Chicago, Illinois (via Comcast Chicago); New York (via Time Warner New York); Washington, D.C., Maryland, Alabama, Virginia (via Comcast); Vancouver, British Columbia (via Telus Canada); and Italy, London, and the rest of UK and rest of Europe (via Infinity IPTV).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pinoytvshows.mobi|title=GMANetwork.com - Pinoy TV|first=GMA New Media,|last=Inc.|date=|website=GMA Pinoy TV|access-date=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a report published showing GMA Network's revenues for 2010 with a total of PhP 14.299 billion, GMA Life TV has 125,000 subscribers (an estimated 800,000 viewers count) while GMA Pinoy TV has an accounted 274,000 subscribers (around 1.8 million viewers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pep.ph/guide/tv/7798/gma-7-ends-2010-with-revenues-of-p14299-billion39-closes-february-with-342-points-vs-abs-cbn39s-32--points-in-nutam-ratings|title=GMA-7 ends 2010 with ”revenues of P14.299 billion'; closes February with 34.2 points vs ABS-CBN's 32  points in NUTAM ratings - PEP.ph: The Number One Site for Philippine Showbiz|author=PEP.ph|date=11 March 2011|work=pep.ph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GMA Pinoy TV"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pinoytvshows.mobi/category/gma-tv-shows/|title=Pinoy TV GMA Shows|work=Pinoy GMA TV Shows}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the first quarter of 2011, GMA Pinoy TV and its home network in the Philippines revealed a new logo with minor changes. The "GMA" letters part is seen to be more embossed and the logo has a "glow" effect. On 28 February 2011 for the first time in GMA International's history, two programs that started airing on GMA Pinoy TV that were still running with new episodes were switched over to [[GMA Life TV]], where it will then air its new episodes to occupy free time slots. This then led to replays of other Kapuso shows. The shows included ''Pinoy MD'' and ''[[Love ni Mister, Love ni Misis]]''.

Also in April 2011, GMA Pinoy TV is now being broadcast by COX Communications in Arizona, areas like Tucson and Arizona, on Channel 482.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pinoytvshows.mobi/category/abs-cbn-tv-shows/|title=ABS GMA Shows|work=GMA ABS TV}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a report dated 16 May 2011 regarding the consolidated gross revenues of GMA Network, Inc. in the 1st quarter of 2011, it is noted that GMA Pinoy TV's subscriptions grew by 10 percent (approximately 300,000 subscribers) and GMA Life TV's subscriptions grew by 2 percent (approximately 128,000).

On 24 November 2011, Thanksgiving Day in the US, GMA Pinoy TV launched the Christmas-themed graphics for 2011, which also included the upper-right logo being converted to a Christmas-themed one. This was also the same date that GMA Network revamped its websites, with new features and a new look.
On December 2011, GMA Pinoy TV’s subscriber count closed at 291,309, a 7% increase over the 2010 closing subscriber number of 273,317. Because of this, revenues grew by 8% year-on-year and are expected to grow at that rate 2012 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bworldonline.com/weekender/content.php?id=53472|title=BusinessWorld - Pinoy TV goes international|work=bworldonline.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923221533/http://www.bworldonline.com/weekender/content.php?id=53472|archivedate=23 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 May 2012, GMA Pinoy TV released on-air alternate versions of its "Up Next" and "You're Watching" bumpers; they were much shorter and instead of clips of the shows, they featured the stars of the respective shows. On 5 June 2012, GMA Pinoy TV began experiencing audio issues with its broadcast, audio that is not so typical of High-Definition, High-Resolution cameras tha GMA uses. On 21 June 2012, the issue was resolved and the original audio type was restored. For the first time in GMA history, ''Idol sa Kusina'', a program originally aired on QTV then [[GMA News TV]] and [[simulcast]] on GMA Life TV moved to GMA Pinoy TV on 14 July 2012.

Overall, in 2012 and Q1 of 2013, subscription to GMA International channels increased by 7 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pep.ph/guide/tv/11900/gma-network-reports-p603-million-net-income-in-q1-2013|title=GMA Network reports P603 million net income in Q1 2013 - PEP.ph: The Number One Site for Philippine Showbiz|author=PEP.ph|date=15 May 2013|work=pep.ph}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 2013, SingTel relaunched this channel together with [[GMA Life TV]] and in the new Fiesta Pack as well after 2 months of hiatus of this channel.

''[[Anna Karenina (2013 TV series)|Anna Karenina]]'' and ''[[My Husband's Lover]]'' became the seventh and eighth primetime TV drama series of GMA Network to premiere just a day after its original premiere. On 27 August 2013, ''[[Pyra: Ang Babaeng Apoy]]'' started airing and was the first GMA Afternoon Prime drama series to be on only a one-episode delay basis, as for previous years, GMA Afternoon Prime dramas have been noted to be two to even four episodes delayed. On 10 September 2013, ''[[Akin Pa Rin ang Bukas]]'' became the ninth primetime TV drama series of GMA Network to premiere just a day after its original premiere on GMA Pinoy TV.

On 17 September 2013, GMA Pinoy TV had experienced technical problems and thus a three-hour delay was caused in its programming schedule, which received negative feedback from the viewers as they were not warned beforehand. The management had appealed to the viewers by saying that such was not intentional and was accidental because of technical/conversion issues. The following day, 18 September 2013, the programming staff of GMA Pinoy TV was prompted to change the programming schedule, effectively removing the airings of [[Eat Bulaga!]] and [[24 Oras]] just a few hours after its original broadcast. Viewers are still hoping for the programming of GMA Pinoy TV to revert to its original state, which most viewers preferred.

On 29 September 2013, a fire hit the basement of GMA Network's Building. The fire was put out in less than 50 minutes as the fire correspondents responded immediately. The fire affected the power supply of GMA Network and thus further affected the normal operations of GMA Network, including the operations of GMA Pinoy TV as well as GMA Life TV and GMA News TV International.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/328695/news/metromanila/fire-hits-basement-of-gma-building|title=Fire hits basement of GMA building|work=GMA News Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/497645/fire-hits-basement-of-gma-network-center|title=Fire hits basement of GMA Network Center|work=inquirer.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the fire, temporary programming was aired consisting of replays of shows from the weekend. The fire had caused disappointment and inconvenience on the part of the viewers/subscribers. However, the management of GMA International assured its subscribers that indeed the appropriate measures are being taken and that normal operations are hoped to be restored at the soonest possible time. On 1 October 2013, programming had slowly been restored. Subscribers reported ''[[Unang Hirit]]'', ''[[24 Oras]]'', ''[[The Ryzza Mae Show]]'' and ''[[Eat Bulaga!]]'' among others to be updated and though slightly off their appropriate timeslot, still was managed to be aired over on GMA Pinoy TV. Also, ''[[My Husband's Lover]]'' aired back-to-back episodes and thus only on 1 October did it become the first TV series of GMA Drama to air the same episode that aired in the Philippines on the same day that it aired on GMA Pinoy TV. ''[[Akin Pa Rin ang Bukas]]'' and ''[[Kahit Nasaan Ka Man]]'' followed and also had back-to-back episodes aired; these "back-to-back" episode appeared to the viewers as hints that the primetime dramas will begin to air on same-day episode basis. However, this idea was dismissed on 2 October 2013 when these shows had re-aired the "catch up" episodes and thus, the primetime dramas were confirmed to be on a one-episode delay basis again. The network's afternoon dramas, ''[[Prinsesa ng Buhay Ko]]'', ''[[Magkano Ba ang Pag-ibig?]]'' and ''[[Pyra: Ang Babaeng Apoy]]'', are still airing on a one-episode delay basis and were not affected by the "catching up" that happened on 1 October. The only afternoon drama left airing on a two-episode delay basis is ''[[Mga Basang Sisiw]]''.

On 5 October 2013, GMA Pinoy TV updated its on-air title screen, in celebration of its "8 Years of Bringing Global Pinoys Closer to Home." On 30 November 2013, GMA Pinoy TV updated its upper-right logo to a Christmas-themed one, alongside GMA's Christmas Theme for 2013, "Sundan Natin ang Bituin Pabalik sa Kanyang Piling". The following day, 1 December 2013, the on-air title screen and graphics were updated.

On 17 December 2013, ''[[The Ryzza Mae Show]]'' and ''[[Eat Bulaga!]]'' were restored to their late night timeslots in the North American feed. It was noted that subscribers continually pleaded GMA Pinoy TV to restore these shows to their late night timeslots as this is convenient for many working subscribers who are only able to watch at that time. After three months and a day of requests, the management finally granted such and the shows were restored to their respective and consecutive late night timeslots. In addition to their restored timeslots, the two shows air as well right after their restored timeslots and so, overall, ''The Ryzza Mae Show'' and ''Eat Bulaga'' air four times on GMA Pinoy TV daily. The New Year Countdown aired on a three-hour delay basis on GMA Pinoy TV on 31 December 2013. From 31 December 2013 to 13 January 2014, GMA Pinoy TV had a special airing of ''[[Titser (TV series)|Titser]]''. This was in the timeslot previously occupied by ''Genesis'' and ''Akin Pa Rin Ang Bukas'', as in the Philippines the timeslots of the two shows were replaced by Hollywood blockbusters.

The GMA Pinoy TV on-screen graphics and logo returned to its regular version on 5 January 2014, marking the end of the Christmas season. GMA Pinoy TV began inserting English subtitles in certain shows like ''[[Wish Ko Lang]]'', ''[[Pepito Manaloto|Pepito Manaloto: Ang Tunay na Kuwento]]'' and ''[[Magpakailanman]]'' on Saturday, 11 January 2014. This is part of GMA Pinoy TV's efforts to expand its audience reach so that not only those who can speak and understand Tagalog can watch GMA Pinoy TV but also those who cannot.

On 22 April 2014, GMA Pinoy TV began to air ''[[Full House (2004 TV series)|Full House]]'', the first Tagalog-dubbed Koreanovela aired on this channel. The shows with English subtitles are noted in the next section "currently broadcast". ''[[Basta Every Day, Happy!]]'' was supposed to premiere on 12 May 2014 (in some territories like the US on the evening of 11 May 2014) and air throughout its entire duration on GMA Pinoy TV but the programming department of GMA International, GMA's international subsidiary, decided to move the show over to [[GMA Life TV]] as it adheres more to GMA Life TV's overall theme as a lifestyle channel as well as the show is a replacement for ''[[Chef Boy Logro: Kusina Master|Kusina Master]]'', so the programming department had seen that the move was done rightfully so.

On 26 May 2014, GMA Pinoy TV began to air ''[[Niño (TV series)|Niño]]'' with no episode delay whatsoever, thus premiering on the same day. This is a historical event for GMA Pinoy TV, as GMA drama series have never aired without episode delays. The nearest to not having a delay was the one-episode
delay policy that was established on 14 February 2012 with the premiere of ''[[My Beloved (TV series)|My Beloved]]''. What is going to happen is in the North American feed as well as on the Australian feed, the premiere of ''[[Niño (TV series)|Niño]]'' and subsequent new episodes on same-day airing will take place on the evening telecast and replays in the afternoon telecasts while in other feeds, particularly, the Middle East and North Africa, Asia Pacific and European feeds,  the premiere and subsequent new episodes will take place in the afternoon telecasts and replays on evening telecasts, thus because these telecasts will take place in the afternoon, such is still not considered delayed, as a new episode of the show still has not premiered. This similar framework followed with ''[[Ang Dalawang Mrs. Real]]'', which premiered on 2 June airing on same-day basis as well along with ''[[Strawberry Lane]]'' on 15 September and ''[[Hiram na Alaala]]'' on 22 September. ''[[Ilustrado (TV series)|Ilustrado]]'', the first BayaniSerye on Philippine Primetime, had a world premiere on all feeds of GMA Pinoy TV on 20 October 2014; this was simultaneous with the premiere in the Philippines and this is the first time such has happened in GMA Pinoy TV history.

On December 2014, GMA Pinoy TV updated its on-air title screen and graphics and upper-right logo to a Christmas-themed one, alongside GMA's Christmas theme for 2014, "Share the Love". On December 31, 2014, ''Countdown to 2015: The GMA New Year Countdown Special'' aired live on GMA Pinoy TV.

===2015–present===
The GMA Pinoy TV on-screen graphics and logo returned to its regular version on 4 January 2015, marking the end of the Christmas season. In the 1st quarter of 2015, in response to viewers' requests and to remain competitive in the international market, GMA Pinoy TV began to increase the number of shows with English subtitles, now including daily dramas like ''[[Let the Love Begin (TV series)|Let the Love Begin]]'' and ''[[The Rich Man's Daughter]]''.

On May 10, 2015, Willie Revillame's ''[[Wowowin]]'' premiered on [[GMA Network]] and on GMA Pinoy TV, serving as his return to the Kapuso Network. It is noted that Revillame's popular ''[[Wowowee]]'' aired for five years on GMA and GMA Pinoy TV's rival stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/455861/showbiz/willie-revillame-to-host-game-show-wowowin-in-return-to-gma-network/|title=Willie Revillame to host game show ‘WowoWin’ in return to GMA Network|author=|date=|website=GMA News Online|access-date=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 27, 2015, the sixth and final State of the Nation Address of President Benigno S. Aquino II aired live in the Asia Pacific and aired on a delay basis in North America, North Africa, the Middle East and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/gmapinoytv/photos/a.255667031999.150450.183148856999/10152864846407000/?type=1&amp;theater|title=GMA Pinoy TV|author=|date=|website=www.Facebook.com|access-date=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-2015 GMA's programming changed from news to other programs to four-five hours programming of Pinoy Telenovela block starting with its AfternoonPrime to GMA telebabad Programming with some programs one day delayed however, has caught up throughout with its future schedules. Eat Bulaga airs its initial programming, and Wowowin, Daily news as well and other programming.

GMA Pinoy TV used the hashtag #Sampuso to celebrate and highlight its 10th year of bringing Filipinos closer to home. The first two concerts were originally supposed to include GMA's Primetime Queen Marian Rivera-Dantes but because of her pregnancy, she chose to withdraw from the concerts for her and her child's safety and AiAi delas Alas served as her replacement in the first two concerts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/482134/showbiz/gma-pinoy-tv-kicks-off-10th-anniversary-celebration-with-ai-ai-delas-alas-in-kapusong-pinoy-vancouver-and-anaheim/|title=GMA Pinoy TV kicks off 10th anniversary celebration with Ai-Ai delas Alas in Kapusong Pinoy Vancouver and Anaheim|author=|date=|website=GMA News Online|access-date=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Sampuso concert was on May 29, 2015 (originally slated for April 24, 2015), at the Orpheum Theater in Vancouver, Canada, featuring AiAi delas Alas, Christian Bautista, Jonalyn Viray, Alden Richards, and Betong Sumaya as Antonietta of [[Bubble Gang]].

The '''''Gascony Show''''' is an English-language radio [[chat show]] aired in the southwest of France and a flagship Sunday evening programme broadcast on [[Radio Coteaux]]&lt;ref name=radiocoteaux1774922&gt;[http://www.radiocoteaux.com/emissionsthematiques.php "Emissions thématiques sur le site officiel de radio coteaux, frequences 104.4 et 97.7 FM"] By Patrick Martinez, Radio Coteaux&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Gascony]] region. The show is presented by Irishman John Slattery.

==The show==
[[File:John Slattery Gascony Show.jpg|thumb|left|alt=John Slattery, the Gascony Show host in the radio studio.|''The Gascony Show'' host, John Slattery, in the studio in Saint Blancard]]
John Slattery takes over the airwaves at 5pm and finishes at 7pm with a handover to Patrick Martinez. The ''Gascony Show'' is a music-based programme that includes light-hearted banter and whimsical jokes by the host. Listeners' views and comments are discussed and there are rotating segments such as "Song of The Week" and "Life in the South-West". To keep listeners on their toes, random topics are picked from a big "Bag O Topics."

Podcasts of all previous shows&lt;ref name=gasconyshow5436793&gt;[http://www.gasconyshow.com/podcasts/GasconyShowPodcasts.xml "The Gascony Show Podcasts"] Recordings of all previous shows.&lt;/ref&gt; are available on the show's website so that previous shows can be listened to again. Previous shows can also be found on iTunes.&lt;ref name=gasconyshow5434434&gt;[https://itunes.apple.com/fr/podcast/the-gascony-show/id455503319 "The Gascony Show on iTunes"] Recordings of all previous shows.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Invited guests==

The show runs interviews with regular and/or rotating guests,&lt;ref name=gasconyshow2334923&gt;[http://www.gasconyshow.com/archives.html "The Gascony Show Archives"] Recorded shows with guests.&lt;/ref&gt; dealing with subjects of both local interest and of general interest to the [[expatriate]] community. The first person to be interviewed on the show was the illustrious English painter, interior designer and writer, Stella Wulf.&lt;ref name=gasconyshow2345213&gt;[http://web.me.com/claire.jefferson/StellaWulf/StopPress.html "Stella Wulf, News &amp; Events"] Interview, Sunday, 10 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Stella is the author of "The Lonesome Froom and other Strange Tales," "Rum Rhymes and Vagabond" and "The Song of the Froom." She recounted humorous stories of her years in France and her efforts to get her books published.

Subsequent interviews included music industry notaries such as Joy Askew and her brother Roger Askew.&lt;ref name=pkmediapromotions6456442&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/user/PKMediaPromotions "The Gascony Show Channel"] Produced by PK Media Promotions.&lt;/ref&gt; These two truly multi-dimensional singers sang some of their favourite songs on air. Joy, who worked closely with the likes of [[Peter Gabriel]] and Joe Jackson, and fronted the all-girl rock band called Bitch, told her story of life as a song-writer and touring musician. The interview proved enormously popular with both English and French speaking listeners in France and it served to create a pattern of story telling and musical treats that would become an underlying trait of later interviews.

A highly commended interview was that with Leaf Fielding,&lt;ref name=leaffielding5437658&gt;[http://www.leaffielding.com/news.html "Leaf Fielding on the Gascony Show"] Interview, Sunday, 11 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; one of the drug-dealers jailed as a result of the famous 1977 drug cartel bust in the UK called [[Operation Julie]]. The interview revolved around Leaf's life, his descent into drug dealing, his imprisonment, and his new life in France. Also discussed was Leaf’s book ''To Live Outside The Law'',&lt;ref name=leaffielding1116349&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jul/07/leaf-fielding-outside-law-drugs "To Live Outside The Law"] By The Guardian, Thursday, 7 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; that tells the story from his early days and his first experience with LSD, to his amazing falling from grace.

==Regular contributors==

The show relies heavily on e-mailed material sent in by listeners that is then read out on air, and most of the regular contributors are local [[expatriates]] living in the Gascony region.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7518">The '''Global Polio Eradication Initiative''' is an initiative created in 1988, just after the [[World Health Assembly]] resolved to [[Poliomyelitis eradication|eradicate the disease poliomyelitis]] by the year 2000. It was described by the [[World Health Organization]] as the largest public health initiative in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hale/Held|first1=Thomas/David|title=The Handbook of Transnational Governance: Institutions and Innovations|publisher=Polity press|isbn=978-0-7456-5060-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategy==
The strategy for the eradication of polio rests on immunizing every at risk child until there is no one left for the disease to transmit to and the disease eventually dies out. The Initiative is spearheaded by the following Organizations:

*WHO ([[World Health Organization]]) who are responsible for planning, technical direction, surveillance and eradication certification. 
*[[Rotary International]] whose responsibilities include fundraising, advocacy, and volunteer recruitment.
* The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] who are in charge of deploying scientists and public health experts to WHO and [[UNICEF]].
* [[UNICEF]] is in charge of the distribution of the vaccine and helping countries develop communication and awareness strategies.
* [[The Gates Foundation]] as well provided a large portion of the funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unicef's Engagement in the Global Polio Eradication Initiative|url=http://www.unicef.org/partners/files/Partnership_profile_2012_Polio_revised.pdf|website=Unicef.org|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Key tactics used by the GPEI include strengthening childhood immunization through oral vaccines, conducting surveillance 
through investigation of [[acute flaccid paralysis]] cases among children under 15 years old (in order to determine areas where the virus is truly eradicated), and conducting "mop up" campaigns in areas where cases of polio have been identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wassilak/Orenstein|first1=Steven/Walter|title=Challenges faced by the global polio eradication initiative|journal=Expert Review of Vaccines|date=2010|doi=10.1586/erv.10.45|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1586/erv.10.45|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
By 2012 the GPEI had raised 9 billion dollars in funding&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Study on the Impact of Polio Eradication on Strengthening (Routine Immunization and Primary Health Care|url=http://sites.middlebury.edu/polio_eradication_impacts_study/files/2012/12/Fact-Sheet-Polio-Eradication-Impacts-Study.pdf|publisher=Middlebury College|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in alone 2011 the GPEI received a 1.1 billion dollars, for a budget of 0.98 billion dollars. 30% of their funding came from the [[Gates Foundation]] 30% from developed governments, 27% from countries at risk of polio, and the rest was made up of donations from non profits, private funders, and other foundations. It is likely that the GPEI will become almost entirely funded by private organizations in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vaccination funding landscape|url=http://www.givewell.org/international/charities/vaccination-organizations#Eradicationinitiatives|website=Givewell.org|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evaluation==
In 1995 a Global Certification Commission was created to oversee the certification of the eradication of wild-type poliovirus transmissions. Certification for the six WHO regions requires all of the countries in that region to be certified by the commission. By the year 2000 both the regions of the Western Pacific and the Americas met the criteria to be certified free of polio transmissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Technical Consultative Group to the World Health Organization on the Global Eradication of Poliomyelitis|title="Endgame" Issues for the Global Polio Eradication Initiative|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|date=2002|volume=34|pages=72–77|doi=10.1086/338262|url=http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/34/1/72.abstract|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2012 the initial number of estimated cases in 1988 of 350,000 across 125 endemic countries has dropped to 650 confirmed cases. In addition the 3 of the six WHO regions are now certified polio eradicated (Europe, the Americas, The West Pacific). [[India]], which many thought would face the greatest challenge to eradication was removed from the list of endemic countries. According to the most recent study by the GPEI, in 2016, there are only three countries still listed as endemic, [[Nigeria]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Data Monitoring|url=http://www.polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring/Poliothisweek/Poliocasesworldwide.aspx|website=Global Polio Eradication Initiative|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is owing to this dramatic reduction that the funding for the GPEI will likely soon come entirely from private donors and foundations such as the [[Gates Foundation]] instead of from individual countries. In fact [[Bill Gates]] has listed polio eradication as one of his "Top Personal Priorities".

A 2011 study by [[Middlebury College]] (commissioned by the [[Gates Foundation]]) indicated a list recommendations for how the GPEI should operate moving forward:

*  Include surveillance for other diseases in AFP (polio) surveillance systems
* Use integrated campaigns to reach marginalized populations
* Standardize and compile polio’s maps of marginalized populations to provide them with additional services
* Fund routine immunization in locations with frequent polio campaigns
* Build staff capacity in a variety of areas beyond polio
* Share pertinent information gathered during polio campaigns with other health programs
* Add questions on key health indicators of interest to post campaign monitoring
* Communicate to workers why repeated campaigns are necessary in high intensity areas
* Raise monetary incentives for campaign workers to a living wage or eliminate them entirely
* Conduct cross planning sessions to determine how programs and services can be integrated to reduce workforce burden without compromising programmatic objectives
* Conduct polio campaigns only where and when they are necessary
*  Mitigate the most serious effects of service interruption with strategic planning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Study on the Impact of Polio Eradication on Strengthening (Routine Immunization and Primary Health Care|url=http://sites.middlebury.edu/polio_eradication_impacts_study/files/2012/12/Fact-Sheet-Polio-Eradication-Impacts-Study.pdf|publisher=Middlebury College|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Endgame==
The final steps of polio eradication for the GPEI, or what is known as the "endgame" are as follows:
#  Detect and interrupt all poliovirus transmissions
# Strengthen immunization systems and withdraw oral polio vaccine
#  Contain poliovirus and certify interruption of transmission
# Ensure the remaining investments made to eradicate polio go to the greater cause of improving global health&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Polio Eradication and Endgame Strategic Plan 2013–2018|url=http://www.polioeradication.org/resourcelibrary/strategyandwork.aspx|website=Polio Eradication Initiative|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Global change''' refers to planetary-scale changes in the [[Earth]] system. The system consists of the [[Terrestrial ecoregion|land]], [[oceans]], [[atmosphere]], [[polar region]]s, [[life]], the planet's natural cycles and deep Earth processes. These constituent parts influence one another. The Earth system now includes [[human society]], so global change also refers to large-scale changes in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=101 |title=International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme the Earth as a System |accessdate=2010-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429213905/http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=101 |archivedate=2010-04-29 |df= }} [[International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme]]&lt;/ref&gt;

More completely, the term "global change" encompasses: [[population]], [[climate]], the [[economy]], resource use, [[energy development]], [[transport]], [[communication]], [[land use]] and [[land cover]], [[urbanization]], [[globalization]], [[atmospheric circulation]], [[ocean circulation]], the [[carbon cycle]], the [[nitrogen cycle]], the [[water cycle]] and other cycles, [[sea ice]] loss, [[sea-level rise]], [[food webs]], [[biological diversity]], [[pollution]], [[health]], [[over fishing]], and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Research/TNT/WEB/Publications/Abrupt_Changes/Abrupt_Changes.pdf|title=The Achilles Heel of the Earth System|accessdate=2010-03-25|publisher   = [[International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of global-change research ==

In 1980, a group of scientists led by Swedish meteorologist [[Bert Bolin]] set up an international program called the [[World Climate Research Programme]] (WCRP), to determine whether the climate was changing, whether climate could be predicted and whether humans were in some way responsible for the change. The programme was sponsored by the [[World Meteorological Organization]] and the [[International Council for Science]] (ICSU). As time went on, there was a growing realisation that climate change was one part of a larger phenomenon, global change. In 1987, a team of researchers, led again by Bert Bolin, James McCarthy, [[Paul Crutzen]], H. Oeschger and others,  successfully argued for an international research programme to investigate global change. This programme, sponsored by ICSU, is the [[International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme]] (IGBP). The programme has eight projects investigating different parts of the Earth system and links between them.

IGBP, WCRP and a third programme, the [[International Human Dimensions Programme]] (IHDP, founded in 1996), spearheaded a landmark science conference held in Amsterdam in 2001. The conference, ''Challenges of a Changing Earth: Global Change Open Science Conference'', led to the Amsterdam Declaration which stated, "In addition to the threat of significant climate change, there is growing concern over the ever-increasing human modification of other aspects of the global environment and the consequent implications for human well-being. Basic goods and services supplied by the planetary life support system, such as food, water, clean air and an environment conducive to human health, are being affected increasingly by global change."&lt;ref name="The Amsterdam Declaration"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essp.org/index.php?id=41|title=The Amsterdam Declaration|accessdate=2010-03-25|publisher=[[Earth System Science Partnership]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The declaration goes on to say, "The international global change programmes urge governments, public and private institutions and people of the world to agree that an ethical framework for global stewardship and strategies for Earth System management are urgently needed."&lt;ref name="The Amsterdam Declaration"/&gt;

Many nations now have their own global change programmes and institutes, for example the US Global Change Research Program and the UK's Quantifying and Understanding the Earth System (QUEST) programme. And since the Amsterdam conference another international programme focusing on biodiversity has been set up, [[Diversitas|DIVERSITAS]]. These programmes form the Earth System Science Partnership.

In 2012, these international programmes held another major science conference in London, Planet Under Pressure: new knowledge towards solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=https://erc.europa.eu/event/planet-under-pressure-new-knowledge-towards-solutions | title=Planet Under Pressure: New Knowledge Towards Solutions | date=2012 | publisher=European Research Council }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==

In the past, the main drivers of global change have been [[solar variation]], [[plate tectonics]], [[volcanism]], proliferation and abatement of [[life]], [[meteorite]] impact, resource depletion, changes in [[Earth]]'s orbit around the sun and changes in the tilt of Earth on its axis. There is overwhelming evidence that now the main driver of planetary-scale change, or global change, is  the growing human population's [[energy demand|demand for energy]], food, goods, services and information, and its [[waste disposal|disposal]] of its [[waste]] products.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} In the last 250 years, global change has caused [[climate change]], [[Holocene extinction|widespread species extinction]]s, fish-stock collapse, [[desertification]], [[ocean acidification]], [[ozone depletion]], [[pollution]], and other large-scale shifts.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Scientists working on the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme have said that Earth is now operating in a "no analogue" state.&lt;ref name="Global Change and the Earth System"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=230|title=Global Change and the Earth System|accessdate=2010-03-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429214445/http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=230|archivedate=2010-04-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Measurements of Earth system processes, past and present, have led to the conclusion that the planet has moved well outside the range of natural variability in the last half million years at least. ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' have been around for about 200,000 years.

What this means for the planet and society remains unclear. But, in the last 20 years there has been an enormous international research effort to understand global change and the Earth system. An aim of this research is to work out if there are planetary boundaries and are we approaching them. Scientists, international governmental organizations and lobbying organizations like [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] argue that current consumption levels, particularly in developed countries, are not sustainable because there is a very real danger they will push the planet into a new state. What this new state might look like is still being debated, but sea levels are likely to rise several meters, the [[pH]] of the oceans, a measure of its acidity, is likely to drop farther than it has in 20 million years, and global atmospheric and ocean circulations may shift markedly. The major cycles – [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], [[sulfur]], [[phosphorus]], [[water]] – and other important parameters would alter, bringing [[drought]] to some places, floods to others. Governments will no longer be able to take for granted the relative environmental stability that has allowed human society to flourish and led to rapid globalization. Most of the population of the planet will be affected. The [[re-insurance]] industry is already taking measures to protect its interests and maximize profits as turbulent times approach.

== Physical evidence ==

{{Refimprove|date=January 2017}}

Humans have always altered their environment. The advent of agriculture around 10000 years ago led to a radical change in land use that still continues. But, the relatively small human population had little impact on a global scale until the start of the [[industrial revolution]] in 1750. This event, followed by the invention of the [[Haber-Bosch]] process in 1909, which allowed large-scale manufacture of [[fertilizers]], led directly to rapid changes to many of the planet's most important physical, chemical and biological processes.

The 1950s marked a shift in gear: global change began accelerating. Between 1950 and 2010, the population more than doubled. In that time, rapid expansion of international trade coupled with upsurges in capital flows and new technologies, particularly information and communication technologies, led to national economies becoming more fully integrated. There was a tenfold increase in economic activity and the world's [[human population]] became more tightly connected than ever before. The period saw sixfold increases in water use and river damming. About 70 percent of the world's [[freshwater]] resource is now used for agriculture. This rises to 90 percent in India and China. Half of the Earth's land surface had now been domesticated. By 2010, urban population, for the first time, exceeded rural population. And there has been a fivefold increase in fertilizer use. Indeed, manufactured reactive nitrogen from fertilizer production and industry now exceeds global terrestrial production of reactive nitrogen. Without artificial fertilizers there would not be enough food to sustain a population of seven billion people.

These changes to the human sub-system have a direct influence on all components of the Earth system. The chemical composition of the atmosphere has changed significantly. Concentrations of important [[greenhouse gases]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[methane]] and [[nitrous oxide]] are rising fast. Over [[Antarctica]] a large hole in the ozone layer appeared. Fisheries collapsed: most of the world's fisheries are now fully or over-exploited. Thirty percent of tropical [[rainforests]] disappeared.

In 2000, Nobel prize-winning scientist [[Paul Crutzen]] announced the scale of change is so great that in just 250 years, human society has pushed the planet into a new geological era: the [[Anthropocene]]. This name has stuck and there are calls for the Anthropocene to be adopted officially. If it is, it may be the shortest of all geological eras. Evidence suggests that if human activities continue to change components of the Earth system, which are all interlinked, this could heave the Earth system out of a one state and into a new state.

== Society ==
Global change in a societal context encompasses social, cultural, technological, political, economic and legal change.  Terms closely related to global change and society are [[globalization]] and global integration. Globalization began with long-distance trade and urbanism. The first record of long distance trading routes is in the third millennium BC. Sumerians in [[Mesopotamia]] traded with settlers in the [[Indus Valley]], in modern-day India.

Since 1750, but more significantly, since the 1950s, global integration has accelerated. This era has witnessed incredible global changes in communications, transportation, and computer technology. Ideas, [[cultures]], people, goods, services and money move around the planet with ease. This new global interconnectedness and free flow of information has radically altered notions of other cultures, [[Group conflict|conflicts]], [[religions]] and [[taboos]]. Now, social movements can and do form at a planetary scale.

Evidence, if more were needed, of the link between social and environmental global change came with the 2008-2009 global [[financial crisis]]. The crisis pushed the planet's main economic powerhouses, the [[United States]], [[Europe]] and much of [[Asia]] into recession. According to the [[Global Carbon Project]], global atmospheric emissions of carbon dioxide fell from an annual growth rate of around 3.4% between 2000 and 2008, to a growth rate of about 2% in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/08/hl-full.htm|title=2008 Global Carbon Budget|publisher=[[Global Carbon Project]]|accessdate=2010-03-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706160635/http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/08/hl-full.htm|archivedate=2010-07-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Planetary management ==
{{main|Planetary management}}

Humans are altering the planet's [[biogeochemical cycle]]s in a largely unregulated way with limited knowledge of the consequences.&lt;ref name="Global Change and the Earth System"/&gt; Without steps to effectively manage the Earth system – the planet's physical, chemical, biological and social components – it is likely there will be severe impacts on people and ecosystems. Perhaps the largest concern is that a component of the Earth system, for example, an [[ocean circulation]], the [[Amazon rainforest]], or [[Arctic]] sea ice, will reach a tipping point and flip from its current state to another state: flowing to not flowing, rainforest to [[savanna]], or ice to no ice. A domino effect could ensue with other components of the Earth system changing state rapidly.

Intensive research over the last 20 years has shown that tipping points do exist in the Earth system, and wide-scale change can be rapid – a matter of decades. Potential tipping points have been identified and attempts have been made to quantify thresholds. But to date, the best efforts can only identify loosely defined "[[planetary boundaries]]" beyond which tipping points exist but their precise locations remain elusive.

There have been calls for a better way to manage the environment on a planetary scale, sometimes referred to as managing "Earth's life support system". The [[United Nations]] was formed to stop wars and provide a platform for dialogue between countries. It was not created to avoid major environmental catastrophe on regional or global scales. But several international environmental conventions exist under the UN, including the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|Framework Convention on Climate Change]], [[Montreal Protocol]], [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification|Convention to Combat Desertification]], and [[Convention on Biological Diversity]]. Additionally, the UN has two bodies charged with coordinating environmental and development activities, the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) and the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP).

In 2004, the IGBP published "Global Change and the Earth System, a planet under pressure."&lt;ref name="Global Change and the Earth System"/&gt; The publication's executive summary concluded: "An overall, comprehensive, internally consistent strategy for stewardship of the Earth system is required". It stated that a research goal is to define and maintain a stable equilibrium in the global environment.

In 2007, France called for UNEP to be replaced by a new and more powerful organization called the "[[United Nations Environment Organization]]". The rationale was that UNEP's status as a "programme", rather than an "organization" in the tradition of the [[World Health Organization]] or the [[World Meteorological Organization]], weakened it to the extent that it was no longer fit for purpose given current knowledge of the state of the planet.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

{{Governance}}
{{basic forms of government}}

'''Global governance''' or '''world governance''' is a movement towards political cooperation among [[transnationality|transnational]] actors, aimed at negotiating responses to problems that affect more than one state or region. Institutions of global [[governance]]—the [[United Nations]], the [[International Criminal Court]], the [[World Bank]], etc.—tend to have limited or demarcated [[Power in international relations|power]] to enforce compliance.  The modern question of world governance exists in the context of [[globalization]] and globalizing regimes of power: politically, economically and culturally.  In response to the acceleration of worldwide [[interdependence]], both between human societies and between humankind and the [[biosphere]], the term "global governance" may name the process of designating laws, rules, or regulations intended for a global scale.

Global governance is not a singular system. There is no "[[world government]]" but the many different regimes of global ''governance'' do have commonalities:
{{quote| While the contemporary system of global political relations is not integrated, the relation between the various regimes of global governance is not insignificant, and the system does have a common dominant organizational form. The dominant mode of organization today is bureaucratic rational—regularized, codified and rational. It is common to all modern regimes of political power and frames the transition from classical sovereignty to what David Held describes as the second regime of sovereignty—liberal international sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | year= 2014 | last1= Jmes | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= Soguk | first2= Nevzat | title= Globalization and Politics, Vol. 1: Global Political and Legal Governance | url= https://www.academia.edu/7285675| publisher= Sage Publications | location= London | page=xxvi}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Definition==

The term world governance is broadly used to designate all regulations intended for organization and centralization of human societies on a global scale. The Forum for a new World Governance defines world governance simply as "collective management of the planet".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160304001610/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?rubrique6&amp;lang=en Forum for a New World Governance ; ''Reasons for this Forum for a new World Governance'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, ''[[government]]'' has been associated with "governing," or with political authority, institutions, and, ultimately, control. ''[[Governance]]'' denotes a process through which institutions coordinate and control independent social relations, and that have the ability to enforce, by force, their decisions. However, authors like [[James Rosenau]] have also used "governance" to denote the regulation of interdependent relations in the absence of an overarching political authority, such as in the international system.&lt;ref&gt;James Rosenau, "Toward an Ontology for Global Governance," ''in'' Martin Hewson and Timothy J. Sinclair (eds.), ''Approaches to Global Governance Theory'' (Albany, NY: [[State University of New York]], 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; Some now speak of the development of "global public policy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Diane |last=Stone |title=Global Public Policy, Transnational Policy Communities and their Networks |journal=Policy Studies Journal |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=19–38 |year=2008 |doi=10.1111/j.1541-0072.2007.00251.x |url=http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/1800/1/WRAP_Stone_Global_Agora__Transnational_Public_Policy_JPS.pdf |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adil Najam]], a scholar on the subject at the [[Pardee School of Global Studies]], [[Boston University]] has defined global governance simply as "the management of global processes in the absence of global government."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailybruin.com/article/2006/10/a-closer-look-professor-seeks- | title=A Closer Look: Professor Seeks Stronger U.N. | publisher=[[The Daily Bruin]] | date=October 18, 2006 | accessdate=October 17, 2012 | author=Riazati, Saba}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Thomas G. Weiss]], director of the Ralph Bunche Institute for International Studies at the Graduate Center ([[CUNY]]) and editor (2000–05) of the journal ''[[Global Governance: A Review of Multilateralism and International Organizations]]'', "'Global governance'—which can be good, bad, or indifferent—refers to concrete cooperative problem-solving arrangements, many of which increasingly involve not only the United Nations of states but also 'other UNs,' namely international secretariats and other non-state actors."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhistory.org/publications/globalgov.html The UN and Global Governance&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821094009/http://www.unhistory.org/publications/globalgov.html |date=2007-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, global governance refers to the way in which global affairs are managed.

The definition is flexible in scope, applying to general subjects such as global security and order or to specific documents and agreements such as the [[World Health Organization]]'s [[International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes|Code on the Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes]]. The definition applies whether the participation is bilateral (e.g. an agreement to regulate usage of a river flowing in two countries), function-specific (e.g. a commodity agreement), regional (e.g. the [[Treaty of Tlatelolco]]), or global (e.g. the [[Non-Proliferation Treaty]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://maihold.org/mediapool/113/1132142/data/Finkelstein.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; These "cooperative problem-solving arrangements" may be formal, taking the shape of laws or formally constituted institutions for a variety of actors (such as state authorities, [[intergovernmental organizations]] (IGOs), [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs), [[private sector]] entities, other [[civil society]] actors, and individuals) to manage collective affairs.&lt;ref name="globall"&gt;Pawel Zaleski ''Global Non-governmental Administrative System: Geosociology of the Third Sector'', [in:] Gawin, Dariusz &amp; Glinski, Piotr [ed.]: "Civil Society in the Making", IFiS Publishers, Warszawa 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; They may also be informal (as in the case of practices or guidelines) or ad hoc entities (as in the case of coalitions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=International Organizations: The Politics and Processes of Global Governance, 2nd ed | publisher=[[Lynne Rienner Publishers]] | author=Margaret P. Karns and Karen A. Mingst | year=2009 | location=[[Boulder, CO]] | page=633 | isbn=978-1-58826-698-9 | url=https://www.rienner.com/title/International_Organizations_The_Politics_and_Processes_of_Global_Governance_2nd_edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a single organization may take the nominal lead on an issue, for example the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) in world trade affairs. Therefore, global governance is thought to be an international process of consensus-forming which generates guidelines and agreements that affect national governments and international corporations. Examples of such consensus would include WHO policies on health issues.

In short, global governance may be defined as "the complex of formal and informal institutions, mechanisms, relationships, and processes between and among states, markets, citizens and organizations, both inter- and non-governmental, through which collective interests on the global plane are articulated, Duties, obligations and privileges are established, and differences are mediated through educated professionals."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas G. Weiss and Ramesh Thakur, ''The UN and Global Governance: An Idea and Its Prospects'', [[Indiana University Press]], forthcoming.&lt;/ref&gt;

Titus Alexander, author of ''Unravelling Global Apartheid, an Overview of World Politics'', has described the current institutions of global governance as a system of [[global apartheid]], with numerous parallels with minority rule in the formal and informal structures of South Africa before 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Unravelling Global Apartheid: An Overview of World Politics | publisher=Polity Press | author=Alexander, Titus | year= 1996 | pages=320 | url=http://www.polity.co.uk/book.asp?ref=9780745613536 | isbn=978-0-7456-1353-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usage===
The [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991 marked the end of [[Westphalian sovereignty|a long period of international history]] based on a policy of [[balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]]s. Since this historic event, the planet has entered a phase of geostrategic breakdown. The national-security model, for example, while still in place for most governments, is gradually giving way to an emerging collective conscience that extends beyond the restricted framework it represents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article15 Blin, Arnaud ; Marin, Gustavo ; "Rethinking Global Governance"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120530202243/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article15 |date=2012-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The post-Cold War world of the 1990s saw a new paradigm emerge based on a number of issues:

* The growing idea of globalization as a significant theme and the subsequent weakening of nation-states, points to a prospect of transferring to a global level of regulatory instruments. Upon the model that regulation was no longer working effectively at the national or regional levels.
* An intensification of environmental concerns, which received multilateral endorsement at the [[Earth Summit]]. The Summit issues, relating to the climate and [[biodiversity]], symbolized a new approach that was soon to be expressed conceptually by the term [[Global Commons]].
* The emergence of conflicts over standards: trade and the environment, trade and [[Property rights (economics)|property rights]], trade and [[public health]]. These conflicts continued the traditional debate over the social effects of macroeconomic stabilization policies, and raised the question of arbitration among equally legitimate objectives in a compartmentalized governance system where the major areas of interdependence are each entrusted to a specialized international institution. Although often limited in scope, these conflicts are nevertheless symbolically powerful, as they raise the question of the principles and institutions of arbitration.
* An increased questioning of international standards and institutions by developing countries, which, having entered the global economy, find it hard to accept that industrialized countries hold onto power and give preference to their own interests. The challenge also comes from civil society, which considers that the international governance system has become the real seat of power and which rejects both its principles and procedures. Although these two lines of criticism often have conflicting beliefs and goals, they have been known to join in order to oppose the dominance of developed countries and major institutions, as demonstrated symbolically by the failure of the [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999]].&lt;ref&gt;For greater discussion, see: Andreani, Gilles; "Governance global : origines d'une idée"; ''Politique étrangère'', Nº 3, 2001, pp.&amp;nbsp;549–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technique ==

Global governance can be roughly divided into four stages:&lt;ref&gt;Avant, Finnemore, &amp; Sell, "Who governs the globe?" in Avant, Finnemore, &amp; Sell (2010), pp. 14–16.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Agenda building|agenda-setting]]; 
# [[policy]]making, 
# [[implementation]] and [[enforcement]], and 
# [[evaluation]], [[wikt:monitoring|monitoring]], and [[adjudication]].

World authorities including international organizations and corporations achieve [[deference]] to their agenda through different means. Authority can derive from [[institution]]al status, [[expertise]], [[moral authority]], [[capacity building|capacity]], or perceived competence.&lt;ref&gt;Avant, Finnemore, &amp; Sell, "Who governs the globe?" in Avant, Finnemore, &amp; Sell (2010), pp. 9–14. "If organizations like the United Nations (UN), the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), and Exxon are all (potentially) global governors, why are they in charge? Why does anyone pay attention to them? [...] We define authority as the ability to induce deference in others. [...] Deference to authority might take a variety of forms. Authority might cause actors to subordinate their own conscious preferences to the directives of the authority and thus, in Robert Dahl's (1957 and 1968) sense, get one actor to do what she would not otherwise do, but it might also have subtler effects. Authority might create new preferences in actors who were previously indifferent or at odds. It might change preferences in others who become persuaded to share the authority's views based on its moral standing or expertise."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[James N. Rosenau]], "Global governance as disaggregated complexity"; in Ba &amp; Hoffmann (2005), pp. 140–41. "In other words, not only has the advent of network forms of organization undermined the authority of states, but in the context of our concern with GG, it has also had even more important consequences. Most notably, networks have contributed to the disaggregation of authority as well as the formation of new collectivities not founded on hierarchical principles. &lt;br&gt; If the notion that new rule systems can be founded on horizontal as well as vertical structures of authority seems awkward, it warrants reiterating that the core of effective authority lies in the compliance of those toward whom it is directed."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
In its initial phase, world governance was able to draw on themes inherited from [[geopolitics]] and the theory of [[international relations]], such as peace, defense, [[geostrategy]], [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] relations, and [[International trade|trade relations]]. But as [[globalization]] progresses and the number of interdependences increases, the global level is also highly relevant to a far wider range of subjects. Following are a number of examples.

===Environmental governance and managing the planet===
"The crisis brought about by the accelerated pace and the probably irreversible character of the [[effect of human activity on the environment|effect of human activities on nature]] requires collective answers from governments and citizens. Nature ignores political and [[social barrier]]s, and the global dimension of the crisis cancels the effects of any action initiated unilaterally by state governments or sectoral institutions, however powerful they may be. [[Climate change]], [[ocean pollution|ocean]] and [[air pollution]], [[nuclear risk]]s and those related to [[genetic manipulation]], the reduction and [[extinction]] of resources and [[biodiversity]], and above all a development model that remains largely unquestioned globally are all among the various manifestations of this accelerated and probably irreversible effect.

This effect is the factor, in the framework of globalization, that most challenges a system of states competing with each other to the exclusion of all others: among the different fields of global governance, [[environmental management]] is the most wanting in urgent answers to the crisis in the form of collective actions by the whole of the human community. At the same time, these actions should help to model and strengthen the progressive building of this community."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article380 Pelayo, G. (ed.) (2008, "Environmental Governance and Managing the Earth"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004143745/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article380 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proposals in this area have discussed the issue of how collective environmental action is possible. Many multilateral, environment-related agreements have been forged in the past 30 years, but their implementation remains difficult.&lt;ref&gt;Bakari, Mohamed El-Kamel. "Sustainable Development in a Global Context: A Success or a Nuisance?" New Global Studies 9.1 (2015): 27–56.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also some discussion on the possibility of setting up an international organization that would centralize all the issues related to international environmental protection, such as the proposed World Environment Organization (WEO). The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) could play this role, but it is a small-scale organization with a limited mandate. The question has given rise to two opposite views: the European Union, especially France and Germany, along with a number of NGOs, is in favor of creating a WEO; the United Kingdom, the USA, and most developing countries prefer opting for voluntary initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;Tubiana, L.; Martimort-Asso, B. (2005), "International Environmental Governance: The next steps", in ''Synthèses'' N°02/2005. Iddri, 2005. 4 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Institute for Sustainable Development proposes a "reform agenda" for global environmental governance. The main argument is that there seems to exist an unspoken but powerful consensus on the essential objectives of a system of global [[environmental governance]]. These goals would require top-quality leadership, a strong environmental policy based on knowledge, effective cohesion and coordination, good management of the institutions constituting the environmental governance system, and spreading environmental concerns and actions to other areas of international policy and action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eoearth.org/article/Global_Environmental_Governance:_Elements_of_a_Reform_Agenda Najam, A., M. Papa and N. Taiyab (2007), "Global Environmental Governance: Elements of a Reform Agenda"], in Cleveland, C.J. (eds), ''The Encyclopedia of Earth'', Environmental Information Coalition, National Council for Science and the Environment, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== A World Environment Organisation ====

The focus of environmental issues shifted to [[climate change]] from 1992 onwards.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; Due to the transboundary nature of climate change, various calls have been made for a World Environment Organisation (WEO) (sometimes referred to as a Global Environment Organisation)&lt;ref&gt;Biermann, F., and Simonis, U.E., 1998. Eine Weltorganisation für Umwelt und Ent-wicklung: Ein Vorschlag [A world organization for environment and development: A proposal]. Universitas. Zeitschrift für interdisziplinäre Wissenschaft 53 (627), pp. 822–31.&lt;/ref&gt; to tackle this global problem on a global scale. At present, a single worldwide governing body with the powers to develop and enforce environmental policy does not exist.&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;Evans, J.P., forthcoming 2012. Environmental Governance. Oxon: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea for the creation of a WEO was discussed thirty years ago&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, S., and Biermann, F., 2005. The debate on a World Environment Organization: An introduction.  A World Environment Organization: Solution or Threat for Effective International Environmental Governance?, Aldershot: Ashgate, 1–23.&lt;/ref&gt; but is receiving fresh attention in the light of arguably disappointing outcomes from recent, ‘environmental mega-conferences’&lt;ref&gt;Seyfang, G. and Jordan, A., 2002. “Mega” Environmental Conferences: vehicles for effective, long term environmental planning?, in: S. Stokke, and O. Thommesen, (eds) Yearbook of International Cooperation on Environment and Development, Earthscan: London: 19–26&lt;/ref&gt;(e.g.[[Rio Summit]] and [[Earth Summit 2002]]).

===== Current global environmental governance =====

International environmental organisations do exist. The [[United Nations Environmental Programme]] (UNEP), created in 1972, coordinates the environmental activity of countries in the UN.  UNEP and similar international environmental organisations are seen as not up to the task. They are criticised as being institutionally weak, fragmented, lacking in standing and providing non-optimal environmental protection.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, G., 1992. New Ways To Make International Environmental Law, American Journal of International Law, 86(2), pp. 259–83. and Voynet, D., 2000. Discours de la ministre sur les priorite´s de la pre´sidence franc¸aise dans le domaine de l’environnement devant la commission environnement—consommation—sante´du parlement europe´en, 6 juillet 2000, Strasbourg’, French Presidency of the EU [online] Available at: www.presidence-europe.fr [Accessed 03 November 2011]. and Kohl, H. et al., 1997. Global Initiative on Sustainable Development. Department of Foreign Affairs (South Africa, 23 June).&lt;/ref&gt; It has been stated that the current decentralised, poorly funded and strictly intergovernmental regime for global environmental issues is sub-standard.&lt;ref name="LodefalkWhalley"&gt;Lodefalk, M., and Whalley, J., 2002. Reviewing Proposals for a World Environment Organization. The World Economy 25 (5) pp. 601–17.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the creation of a WEO may threaten to undermine some of the more effective aspects of contemporary global environmental governance;&lt;ref&gt;Najam, A., 2003. The Case against a New International Environmental Organization. Global Governance 9 (3) pp. 367–84.&lt;/ref&gt; notably its fragmented nature, from which flexibility stems.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; This also allows responses to be more effective and links to be forged across different domains.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; Even though the environment and climate change are framed as global issues, Levin states that ‘it is precisely at this level that government institutions are least effective and trust most delicate’&lt;ref&gt;Levin, S., 1998. Ecosystems and the biosphere as complex adaptive systems. Ecosystems 1 pp. 431–36&lt;/ref&gt; while Oberthur and Gehring argue that it would offer little more than institutional restructuring for its own sake.&lt;ref&gt;Oberthür, S. and Gehring, T., 2004. Reforming international environmental governance: an institutionalist critique of the proposal for a World Environmental Organisation. Politics, Law and Economics 4 pp. 359–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====A World Environment Organisation and the World Trade Organisation=====

Many proposals for the creation of a WEO have emerged from the trade and environment debate.&lt;ref name="Biermann"&gt;Biermann, F., 2001. The emerging debate on the need for a [[World Environmental Organization]]: a commentary. Global Environmental Politics, 1 pp. 45–55.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that instead of creating a WEO to safeguard the environment, environmental issues should be directly incorporated into the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO).&lt;ref&gt;von Moltke, K., 2001. The Organization of the Impossible. Global Environmental Politics 1 (1).&lt;/ref&gt; The WTO has “had success in integrating [[trade agreement]]s and opening up markets because it is able to apply legal pressure to nation states and resolve disputes”.&lt;ref name="Biermann"/&gt; Greece and Germany are currently in discussion about the possibility of [[solar energy]] being used to repay some of Greece’s debt after their economy crashed in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, H., 2011. Germany may buy Greeks’ sunshine. The Guardian, [online]6 October. Available at &lt;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/oct/06/greece-debt-germany-roessler-investment?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487&gt; [Accessed 2 November 2011],&lt;/ref&gt; This exchange of resources, if it is accepted, is an example of increased international cooperation and an instance where the WTO could embrace energy trade agreements. If the future holds similar trade agreements, then an environmental branch of the WTO would surely be necessary. However critics of a WTO/WEO arrangement say that this would neither concentrate on more directly addressing underlying market failures, nor greatly improve rule-making.&lt;ref name="LodefalkWhalley"/&gt;

The creation of a new agency, whether it be linked to the WTO or not, has now been endorsed by [[Renato Ruggiero]], the former head of the World Trade Organization (WTO), as well as by the new WTO director-designate, [[Supachai Panitchpakdi]].&lt;ref name="Biermann"/&gt; The debate over a global institutional framework for environmental issues will undoubtedly rumble on but at present there is little support for any one proposal.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt;

===Governance of the economy and of globalisation===
The [[Great Recession|2008 financial crisis]] may have undermined faith that [[laissez-faire capitalism]] will correct all serious financial malfunctioning on its own, as well as belief in the presumed independence of the economy from politics. It has been stated that, lacking in transparency and far from democratic, international financial institutions may be incapable of handling financial collapses. There are many who believe free-market capitalism may be incapable of forming the economic policy of a stable society, as it has been theorised that it can exacerbate inequalities.

Nonetheless, the debate on the potential failings of the system has led the academic world to seek solutions. According to Tubiana and Severino, "refocusing the doctrine of international cooperation on the concept of public goods offers the possibility . . . of breaking the deadlock in international negotiations on development, with the perception of shared interests breathing new life into an international solidarity that is running out of steam."&lt;ref&gt;Tubiana, L. and J.-M. Severino (2002), "Biens publics globaux, gouvernance mondiale et aide publique au développement", ''in'' Jacquet P., J. Pisani Ferry and L. Tubiana, ''Gouvernance mondiale'', La Documentation française, Les Rapports du CAE, N°37, pp. 349–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Stiglitz]] argues that a number of global public goods should be produced and supplied to the populations, but are not, and that a number of global [[externality|externalities]] should be taken into consideration, but are not. On the other hand, he contends, the international stage is often used to find solutions to completely unrelated problems under the protection of opacity and secrecy, which would be impossible in a national democratic framework.&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, J.E. (2006), "Global public goods and global finance: does global governance ensure that the global public interest is served?" ''in'' Touffut, J.-Ph. (ed.), ''Advancing Public Goods'', Cournot Centre for Economic Studies, Paris, pp. 149/164.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the subject of international trade, Susan George states that ". . . in a rational world, it would be possible to construct a trading system serving the needs of people in both North and South. . . . Under such a system, crushing third world debt and the devastating structural adjustment policies applied by the World Bank and the IMF would have been unthinkable, although the system would not have abolished capitalism."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article239 George, S. (2007), "Alternative finances", ''Le Monde Diplomatique'', January.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004143817/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article239 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political and institutional governance===
Building a responsible world governance that would make it possible to adapt the political organization of society to globalization implies establishing a democratic political legitimacy at every level: local, national, regional and global.

Obtaining this legitimacy requires rethinking and reforming, all at the same time:
* the fuzzy maze of various international organizations, instituted mostly in the wake of World War II; what is needed is a system of international organizations with greater resources and a greater intervention capacity, more transparent, fairer, and more democratic;
* the [[Westphalian sovereignty|Westphalian system]], the very nature of states along with the role they play with regard to the other institutions, and their relations to each other; states will have to share part of their sovereignty with institutions and bodies at other territorial levels, and all with have to begin a major process to deepen democracy and make their organization more responsible;
* the meaning of citizen sovereignty in the different government systems and the role of citizens as political protagonists; there is a need to rethink the meaning of political representation and participation and to sow the seeds of a radical change of consciousness that will make it possible to move in the direction of a situation in which citizens, in practice, will play the leading role at every scale.

The political aspect of world governance is discussed in greater detail in the section [[Global governance#Problems of World Governance and Principles of Governance|Problems of World Governance and Principles of Governance]]

===Governance of peace, security, and conflict resolution===
Armed conflicts have changed in form and intensity since the Berlin wall came down in 1989. The events of [[9/11]], the wars [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|in Afghanistan]] and in [[Iraq War|Iraq]], and repeated terrorist attacks all show that conflicts can repercuss well beyond the belligerents directly involved. The major powers and especially the United States, have used war as a means of resolving conflicts and may well continue to do so. If many in the United States believe that fundamentalist Muslim networks are likely to continue to launch attacks, in Europe nationalist movements have proved to be the most persistent terrorist threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Girard|first=Quentin|title=En Europe les actes terroristes islamiques sont rares|journal=Libération|date=July 27, 2011|url=http://www.liberation.fr/monde/01012351351-en-europe-les-actes-terroristes-islamistes-sont-rares}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Global War on Terrorism]] arguably presents a form of emerging global governance in the sphere of security with the United States leading cooperation among the Western states, non-Western nations and international institutions. Beyer argues that participation in this form of 'hegemonic governance' is caused both by a shared identity and ideology with the US, as well as cost-benefit considerations.&lt;ref&gt;Beyer, Anna Cornelia (2010), "Counterterrorism and International Power Relations", IB Tauris, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Pesawar school attack 2014 is a big challenge to us. Militants from the Pakistani Taliban have attacked an army-run school in Peshawar, killing 141 people, 132 of them children, the military say.

At the same time, civil wars continue to break out across the world, particularly in areas where civil and human rights are not respected, such as Central and Eastern Africa and the Middle East. These and other regions remain deeply entrenched in permanent crises, hampered by authoritarian regimes, many of them being supported by the United States, reducing entire swathes of the population to wretched living conditions. The wars and conflicts we are faced with have a variety of causes: economic inequality, social conflict, religious sectarianism, Western imperialism, colonial legacies, disputes over territory and over control of basic resources such as water or land. They are all illustrations a deep-rooted crisis of world governance.

The resulting bellicose climate imbues international relations with competitive nationalism and contributes, in rich and poor countries alike, to increasing military budgets, siphoning off huge sums of public money to the benefit of the arms industry and military-oriented scientific innovation, hence fueling global insecurity. Of these enormous sums, a fraction would be enough to provide a permanent solution for the basic needs of the planet's population hence practically eliminating the causes of war and terrorism.

Andrée Michel argues that the arms race is not only proceeding with greater vigor, it is the surest means for Western countries to maintain their hegemony over countries of the South. Following the break-up of the Eastern bloc countries, she maintains, a strategy for the manipulation of the masses was set up with a permanent invention of an enemy (currently incarnated by Iraq, Iran, Libya, Syria, and North Korea) and by kindling fear and hate of others to justify perpetuating the [[Military–industrial complex]] and arms sales. The author also recalls that the "Big Five" at the UN who have the veto right are responsible for 85% of arms sales around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Michel, Andrée (1999), ''Surarmement, pouvoirs, démocratie''; L'Harmattan, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proposals for the governance of peace, security, and conflict resolution begin by addressing [[positive peace|prevention of the causes of conflicts]], whether economic, social, religious, political, or territorial. This requires assigning more resources to improving people's living conditions—health, accommodation, food, and work—and to education, including education in the values of [[peace]], [[social justice]], and unity and diversity as two sides of the same coin representing the global village.

Resources for peace could be obtained by regulating, or even reducing military budgets, which have done nothing but rise in the past recent years. This process could go hand in hand with plans for global disarmament and the conversion of arms industries, applied proportionally to all countries, including the major powers. Unfortunately, the warlike climate of the last decade has served to relegate all plans for global disarmament, even in civil-society debates, and to pigeonhole them as a long-term goal or even a Utopian vision. This is definitely a setback for the cause of peace and for humankind, but it is far from being a permanent obstacle.

International institutions also have a role to play in resolving armed conflicts. Small international rapid deployment units could intervene in these with an exclusive mandate granted by a reformed and democratic United Nations system or by relevant regional authorities such as the European Union. These units could be formed specifically for each conflict, using armies from several countries as was the case when the [[UNIFIL]] was reinforced during the [[2006 Lebanon War]]. On the other hand, no national army would be authorized to intervene unilaterally outside its territory without a UN or regional mandate.

Another issue that is worth addressing concerns the legitimate conditions for the use of force and conduct during war. Jean-Réné Bachelet offers an answer with the conceptualization of a military ethics corresponding to the need for a "principle of humanity." The author defines this principle as follows: "All human beings, whatever their race, nationality, gender, age, opinion, or religion, belong to one same humanity, and every individual has an inalienable right to respect for his life, integrity, and dignity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article378 Bachelet, Jean-René; ''Military Ethics for a Better World''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004143947/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article378 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governance of science, education, information, and communications===
The World Trade Organization's (WTO) agenda of liberalizing public goods and services are related to culture, science, education, health, living organisms, information, and communication.&lt;ref&gt;Violaine HACKER, “ Cultiver la créativité, corollaire de la diversité culturelle européenne ”, Revue Géoéconomie : Cinéma: le déclin de l'empire américain?, numéro 58 – été 2011 : http://www.choiseul-editions.com/documents/BC-G58.pdf?PHPSESSID=cab73ffbe617a07900584f09d655e3d0&lt;/ref&gt; This plan has been only partially offset by the [[alter-globalization movement]], starting with [[1999 Seattle WTO protests|the events]] that took place at the [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999|1999 Seattle meeting]], and on a totally different and probably far more influential scale in the medium and long term, by the astounding explosion of collaborative practices on the [[Internet]]. However, lacking political and widespread citizen support as well as sufficient resources, [[civil society]] has not so far been able to develop and disseminate alternative plans for society as a whole on a global scale, even though plenty of proposals and initiatives have been developed, some more successful than others, to build a fairer, more responsible, and more solidarity-based world in all of these areas.

Above all, each country tries to impose their values and collective preferences within international institutions such like WTO or UNESCO, particularly in the Medias sector. This is an excellent opportunity to promote their soft power, for instance with the promotion of the cinema&lt;ref&gt;Economic warfare on the silver screen- Interview of Violaine Hacker, {{cite web |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20110625-economic-warfare-on-the-silver-screen-cinema-cannes-festival-2011-hollywood-france |title=Economic warfare on the silver screen |accessdate=2015-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119013813/http://www.france24.com/en/20110625-economic-warfare-on-the-silver-screen-cinema-cannes-festival-2011-hollywood-france |archivedate=2012-01-19 |df= |date=1970-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As far as science is concerned, "[r]esearch increasingly bows to the needs of financial markets, turning competence and knowledge into commodities, making employment flexible and informal, and establishing contracts based on goals and profits for the benefit of private interests in compliance with the competition principle. The directions that research has taken in the past two decades and the changes it has undergone have drastically removed it from its initial mission (producing competence and knowledge, maintaining independence) with no questioning of its current and future missions. Despite the progress, or perhaps even as its consequence, humankind continues to face critical problems: poverty and hunger are yet to be vanquished, nuclear arms are proliferating, environmental disasters are on the rise, social injustice is growing, and so on.

Neoliberal commercialization of the commons favors the interests of pharmaceutical companies instead of the patients', of food-processing companies instead of the farmers' and consumers'. Public research policies have done nothing but support this process of economic profitability, where research results are increasingly judged by the financial markets. The system of systematically patenting knowledge and living organisms is thus being imposed throughout the planet through the 1994 WTO agreements on intellectual property. Research in many areas is now being directed by private companies."&lt;ref&gt;[http://sciencescitoyennes.org/spip.php?article1452 "Atelier de la Fondation Sciences citoyennes au Forum social mondial"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714091819/http://sciencescitoyennes.org/spip.php?article1452 |date=2007-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the global level, "[i]nstitutions dominating a specific sector also, at every level, present the risk of reliance on technical bodies that use their own references and deliberate in an isolated environment. This process can be observed with the 'community of patents' that promotes the patenting of living organisms, as well as with authorities controlling nuclear energy. This inward-looking approach is all the more dangerous that communities of experts are, in all complex technical and legal spheres, increasingly dominated by the major economic organizations that finance research and development."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

On the other hand, several innovative experiments have emerged in the sphere of science, such as: [[conscience clauses]] and citizens' panels as a tool for democratizing the production system: [[science shop]]s and [[Citizen science|community-based research]]. Politically committed scientists are also increasingly organizing at the global level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.uvic.ca/ocbr/assets/pdfs/Global%20Alliance.pdf Global Alliance on Community-Engaged Research; ''Global Alliance on Community-Engaged Research'']{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As far as education is concerned, the effect of commoditization can be seen in the serious tightening of education budgets, which affects the quality of general education as a public service. The Global Future Online report reminds us that ". . . at the half-way point towards 2015 ''(author's note: the deadline for the [[Millennium Goals]])'', the gaps are daunting: 80 million children (44 million of them girls) are out of school, with marginalized groups (26 million disabled and 30 million conflict-affected children) continuing to be excluded.

In addition to making the current educational system available universally, there is also a call to improve the system and adapt it to the speed of changes in a complex and unpredictable world. On this point, Edgar Morin asserts that we must "[r]ethink our way of organizing knowledge. This means breaking down the traditional barriers between disciplines and designing new ways to reconnect that which has been torn apart." The UNESCO report drawn up by Morin contains "seven principles for education of the future": detecting the error and illusion that have always parasitized the human spirit and human behavior; making knowledge relevant, i.e. a way of thinking that makes distinctions and connections; teaching the human condition; teaching terrestrial identity; facing human and scientific uncertainties and teaching strategies to deal with them; teaching understanding of the self and of others, and an ethics for humankind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article223 Morin, Edgar; ''Seven Complex Lessons in Education for the Future''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144020/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article223 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exponential growth of new technologies, the Internet in particular, has gone hand in hand with the development over the last decade of a global community producing and exchanging goods. This development is permanently altering the shape of the entertainment, publishing, and music and media industries, among others. It is also influencing the social behavior of increasing numbers of people, along with the way in which institutions, businesses, and civil society are organized. [[Peer-to-peer]] communities and collective knowledge-building projects such as [[Wikipedia]] have involved millions of users around the world. There are even more innovative initiatives, such as alternatives to private copyright such as [[Creative Commons]], cyber democracy practices, and a real possibility of developing them on the sectoral, regional, and global levels.

==Regional views==
Regional players, whether regional conglomerates such as [[Mercosur]] and the European Union, or major countries seen as key regional players such as China, the United States, and India, are taking a growing interest in world governance.&lt;ref name="ORF"&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Governance|url=http://www.orfonline.org/programme/global-governance/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of discussion of this issue can be found in the works of: Martina Timmermann ''et al.'', ''Institutionalizing Northeast Asia: Regional Steps toward Global Governance'';&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unu.edu/unupress/sample-chapters/institutionalizing_Northeast_Asia_web.pdf Timmermann, M. and J.

Interdependence among countries and regions hardly being refutable today, regional integration is increasingly seen not only as a process in itself, but also in its relation to the rest of the world, sometimes turning questions like "What can the world bring to my country or region?" into "What can my country or region bring to the rest of the world?" Following are a few examples of how regional players are dealing with these questions.

===Africa===
Often seen as a problem to be solved rather than a people or region with an opinion to express on international policy, Africans and Africa draw on a philosophical tradition of community and social solidarity that can serve as inspiration to the rest of the world and contribute to building world governance. One example is given by Sabelo J. Ndlovu-Gathseni when he reminds us of the relevance of the Ubuntu concept, which stresses the interdependence of human beings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article198 Sabelo J. Ndlovu-Gathseni; ''Giving Africa Voice within Global Governance: Oral History, Human Rights and the United Nations (UN) Human Rights Council''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144623/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article198 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

African civil society has thus begun to draw up proposals for governance of the continent, which factor in all of the dimensions: local, African, and global. Examples include proposals by the network "Dialogues sur la gouvernance en Afrique" for "the construction of a local legitimate governance," state reform "capable of meeting the continent's development challenges," and "effective regional governance to put an end to Africa's marginalization."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afrique-gouvernance.net/fiches/bipint/fiche-bipint-63.html Network "Dialogues sur la gouvernance en Afrique"; ''Changeons l’Afrique, 15 propositions pour commencer...'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Foreign-policy proposals announced by President [[Barack Obama]] include restoring the [[Global Poverty Act]], which aims to contribute to meeting the UN Millennium Development Goals to reduce by half the world population living on less than a dollar a day by 2015. Foreign aid is expected to double to 50 billion dollars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0709/24757.html "Record $49B foreign aid budget clears House" in ''Politico'', July 9, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; The money will be used to help build educated and healthy communities, reduce poverty and improve the population's health.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fpif.org/fpiftxt/6274 "In Defense of Aid" in ''Foreign Policy in Focus'', July 17, 2009.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090723092252/http://www.fpif.org/fpiftxt/6274 |date=July 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of international institutions, The White House Web site advocates reform of the World Bank and the IMF, without going into any detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/09/04/02/A-Turning-Point/|title="A Turning Point" April 2, 2009|author=|date=|website=whitehouse.gov|accessdate=3 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613174551/https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/09/04/02/A-Turning-Point|archive-date=2015-06-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Below are further points in the Obama-Biden plan for foreign policy directly related to world governance:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barackobama.com/issues/foreign_policy/index_campaign.php "Foreign Policy" in ''Organizing for America''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707091922/http://www.barackobama.com/issues/foreign_policy/index_campaign.php |date=2009-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* strengthening of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty;
* global de-nuclearization in several stages including stepping up cooperation with Russia to significantly reduce stocks of nuclear arms in both countries;
* revision of the culture of secrecy: institution of a National Declassification Center to make declassification secure but routine, efficient, and cost-effective;
* increase in global funds for AIDS, TB and malaria. Eradication of malaria-related deaths by 2015 by making medicines and mosquito nets far more widely available;
* increase in aid for children and maternal health as well as access to reproductive health-care programs;
* creation of a 2-billion-dollar global fund for education. Increased funds for providing access to drinking water and sanitation;
* other similarly large-scale measures covering agriculture, small- and medium-sized enterprises and support for a model of international trade that fosters job creation and improves the quality of life in poor countries;
* in terms of energy and global warming, Obama advocates a) an 80% reduction of greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050 b) investing 150 billion dollars in alternative energies over the next 10 years and c) creating a Global Energy Forum capable of initiating a new generation of climate protocols.

===Latin America===
The 21st century has seen the arrival of a new and diverse generation of left-wing governments in Latin America. This has opened the door to initiatives to launch political and governance renewal. A number of these initiatives are significant for the way they redefine the role of the state by drawing on citizen participation, and can thus serve as a model for a future world governance built first and foremost on the voice of the people. The constituent assemblies in Ecuador and Bolivia are fundamental examples of this phenomenon.

In Ecuador, social and indigenous movements were behind the discussions that began in 1990 on setting up a constituent assembly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://qollasuyu.indymedia.org/es/2005/10/2700.shtml Servicio Informativo "Alai-amlatina"; Asamblea Constituyente (Ecuador)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305040740/http://qollasuyu.indymedia.org/es/2005/10/2700.shtml |date=2010-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of Rafael Correa's arrival at the head of the country in November 2006, widespread popular action with the slogan "''que se vayan todos''" (let them all go away) succeeded in getting all the political parties of congress to accept a convocation for a referendum on setting up the assembly.

In April 2007, Rafael Correa's government organized a consultation with the people to approve setting up a constituent assembly. Once it was approved, 130 members of the assembly were elected in September, including 100 provincial members, 24 national members and 6 for migrants in Europe, Latin America and the USA. The assembly was officially established in November. Assembly members belonged to traditional political parties as well as the [[new social movements]]. In July 2008, the assembly completed the text for the new constitution and in September 2008 there was a referendum to approve it. Approval for the new text won out, with 63.9% of votes for compared to 28.1% of votes against and a 24.3% abstention rate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asambleaecuador.org Asamblea Constituyente Ecuador 2008; ''Nueva Constitución del Ecuador'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The new constitution establishes the rule of law on economic, social, cultural and environmental rights (ESCER). It transforms the legal model of the social state subject to the rule of law into a "constitution of guaranteed well-being" (''Constitución del bienestar garantizado'') inspired by the ancestral community ideology of "good living" propounded by the Quechuas of the past, as well as by 21st century socialist ideology. The constitution promotes the concept of food sovereignty by establishing a protectionist system that favors domestic production and trade. It also develops a model of public aid for education, health, infrastructures and other services.

In addition, it adds to the three traditional powers, a fourth power called the Council of Citizen Participation and Social Control, made up of former constitutional control bodies and social movements, and mandated to assess whether public policies are constitutional or not.

The new Bolivian constitution was approved on 25 January 2009 by referendum, with 61.4% votes in favor, 38.6% against and a 90.2% turnout. The proposed constitution was prepared by a constituent assembly that did not only reflect the interests of political parties and the elite, but also represented the indigenous peoples and social movements. As in Ecuador, the proclamation of a constituent assembly was demanded by the people, starting in 1990 at a gathering of indigenous peoples from the entire country, continuing with the indigenous marches in the early 2000s and then with the Program Unity Pact (''Pacto de Unidad Programático'') established by family farmers and indigenous people in September 2004 in Santa Cruz.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cedib.org/dac ''Hacia una Asamblea Constituyente soberana y participativa''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050125005025/http://www.cedib.org/dac/ |date=2005-01-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The constitution recognizes the autonomy of indigenous peoples, the existence of a specific indigenous legal system, exclusive ownership of forest resources by each community and a quota of indigenous members of parliament. It grants autonomy to counties, which have the right to manage their natural resources and elect their representatives directly. The ''latifundio'' system has been outlawed, with maximum ownership of 5,000 hectares allowed per person. Access to water and sanitation are covered by the constitution as human rights that the state has to guarantee, as well as other basic services such as electricity, gas, postal services, and telecommunications that can be provided by either the state or contracting companies. The new constitution also establishes a social and community economic model made up of public, private, and social organizations, and cooperatives. It guarantees private initiative and freedom of enterprise, and assigns public organizations the task of managing natural resources and related processes as well as developing public services covered by the constitution. National and cooperative investment is favored over private and international investment.
The "unitary plurinational" state of Bolivia has 36 official indigenous languages along with Spanish. Natural resources belong to the people and are administered by the state. The form of democracy in place is no longer considered as exclusively representative and/or based on parties. Thus, "the people deliberate and exercise government via their representatives and the constituent assembly, the citizen legislative initiative and the referendum . . ."&lt;ref&gt;2009 Bolivian Constitution, article 4. 1&lt;/ref&gt; and "popular representation is exercised via the political parties, citizen groups, and indigenous peoples."&lt;ref&gt;2009 Bolivian Constitution, article 222&lt;/ref&gt; This way, "political parties, and/or citizen groups and/or indigenous peoples can present candidates directly for the offices of president, vice-president, senator, house representative, constituent-assembly member, councilor, mayor, and municipal agent. The same conditions apply legally to all. . . ."&lt;ref&gt;2009 Bolivian Constitution, article 224&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in Latin America: "[[Amazon basin|Amazonia]] . . . is an enormous biodiversity reservoir and a major climate-regulation agent for the planet but is being ravaged and deteriorated at an accelerated pace; it is a territory almost entirely devoid of governance, but also a breeding place of grassroots organization initiatives.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 IBase; FnGM; ''What Amazonia Does the World Need?'', Rio de Janeiro, 2008, p. 16] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144106/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Amazonia can be the fertile field of a true school of 'good' governance if it is looked after as a common and valuable good, first by Brazilians (65% of Amazonia is within Brazilian borders) and the people of the South American countries surrounding it, but also by all the Earth's inhabitants."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 IBase; FnGM; Ibid. p. 6] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144106/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Accordingly, "[f]rom a world-governance perspective, [Amazonia] is in a way an enormous laboratory. Among other things, Amazonia enables a detailed examination of the negative effects of productivism and of the different forms of environmental packaging it can hide behind, including 'sustainable development.' Galloping urbanization, Human Rights violations, the many different types of conflicts (14 different types of conflicts have been identified within the hundreds of cases observed in Amazonia), protection of indigenous populations and their active participation in local governance: these are among the many Amazonian challenges also affecting the planet as a whole, not to mention the environment. The hosts of local initiatives, including among the indigenous populations, are however what may be most interesting in Amazonia in that they testify to the real, concrete possibility of a different form of organization that combines a healthy local economy, good social cohesion, and a true model of sustainable development—this time not disguised as something else. All of this makes Amazonia 'a territory of solutions.'"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 IBase; FnGM; Ibid. pp. 34–41] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144106/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Arnaud Blin, the Amazonian problem helps to define certain fundamental questions on the future of humankind. First, there is the question of social justice: "[H]ow do we build a new model of civilization that promotes social justice? How do we set up a new social architecture that allows us to live together?" The author goes on to refer to concepts such as the concept of "people's territory " or even "life territory" rooted in the indigenous tradition and serving to challenge private property and social injustice. He then suggests that the emerging concept of the "responsibility to protect," following up on the "right of humanitarian intervention" and until now used to try to protect populations endangered by civil wars, could also be applied to populations threatened by economic predation and to environmental protection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 IBase; FnGM; Ibid.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144106/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===
The growing interest in world governance in Asia represents an alternative approach to official messages, dominated by states' nationalist visions. An initiative to develop proposals for world governance took place in Shanghai in 2006, attended by young people from every continent. The initiative produced ideas and projects that can be classified as two types: the first and more traditional type, covering the creation of a number of new institutions such as an International Emissions Organization,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article6 Expanding and Reinforcing the Objectives of the Kyoto Protocol: Inciting International Stakeholders to Engage in Greenhouse-gas Transparency] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144648/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article6 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a second more innovative type based on organizing network-based systems. For example, a system of cooperative control on a worldwide level among states&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article24 Youth Innovation Competition on Global Governance; ''Conference for Climate Change''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810043211/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article24 |date=2011-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and self-organization of civil society into networks using new technologies, a process that should serve to set up a ''Global Calling-for-Help Center'' or a new model based on citizens who communicate freely, share information, hold discussions, and seek consensus-based solutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article94 Global Calling-for-Help Center] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144601/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article94 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They would use the Internet and the media, working within several types of organizations: universities, NGOs, local volunteers and civil-society groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article26 World Team E. Youth Innovation Competition on Global Governance; ''Greenhouse-gas Emissions and Global Mitigation Efforts''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144206/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article26 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the demographic importance of the continent, the development of discussion on governance and practices in Asia at the regional level, as well as global-level proposals, will be decisive in the years ahead in the strengthening of global dialog among all sorts of stakeholders, a dialog that should produce a fairer world order.(See [[Kishore Mahbubani]]).

===Europe===
According to [[Michel Rocard]], Europe does not have a shared vision, but a collective history that allows Europeans to opt for projects for gradual political construction such as the European Union. Drawing on this observation, Rocard conceives of a European perspective that supports the development of three strategies for constructing world governance: reforming the UN, drawing up international treaties to serve as the main source of global regulations, and "the progressive penetration of the international scene by justice."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article109 Rocard, Michel ; ''World Governance. A Personal European View''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144222/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article109 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rocard considers that there are a number of "great questions of the present days" including recognition by all nations of the [[International Criminal Court]], the option of an international police force authorized to arrest international criminals, and the institution of judicial procedures to deal with tax havens, massively polluting activities, and states supporting terrorist activities. He also outlines "new problems" that should foster debate in the years to come on questions such as a project for a Declaration of Interdependence, how to re-equilibrate world trade and WTO activities, and how to create world regulations for managing collective goods (air, drinking water, oil, etc.) and services (education, health, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article109 Rocard, Michel; ''Ibid.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144222/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article109 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin Ortega similarly suggests that the European Union should make a more substantial contribution to global governance, particularly through concerted action in international bodies. European states, for instance, should reach an agreement on the reform of the United Nations Security Council.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Ortega, Building the future: the EU's contribution to global governance, ISS, Paris, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the [[European Strategy and Policy Analysis System]] (ESPAS), an inter-institutional pilot project of the European Union which aims to assist EU policy formulation through the identification and critical analysis of long-term global trends, highlighted the importance of expanding global governance over the next 20 years.&lt;ref name="The European Strategy and Policy Analysis System"&gt;{{cite web|last=ESPAS|title=The European Strategy and Policy Analysis System|url=http://www.espas.europa.eu/home/|publisher=EUISS|accessdate=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stakeholders' views==
It is too soon to give a general account of the view of world-governance stakeholders, although interest in world governance is on the rise on the regional level, and we will certainly see different types of stakeholders and social sectors working to varying degrees at the international level and taking a stand on the issue in the years to come.

===Institutional and state stakeholders===

===Members of parliament===
The World Parliamentary Forum, open to members of parliament from all nations and held every year at the same time as the [[World Social Forum]], drew up a declaration at the sixth forum in Caracas in 2006. The declaration contains a series of proposals that express participants' opinion on the changes referred to.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article98 World Parliamentary Forum, "Final Declaration of the Sixth World Parliamentary Forum - Caracas 2006"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144303/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article98 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regional organizations===
The European Commission referred to global governance in its White Paper on European Governance. It contends that the search for better global governance draws on the same set of shared challenges humanity is currently facing. These challenges can be summed up by a series of goals: [[sustainable development]], [[security]], [[peace]] and equity (in the sense of "fairness").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/governance/governance_global/index_en.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225182328/http://ec.europa.eu/governance/governance_global/index_en.htm |archivedate=2009-02-25 |df= }} "Global governance: contribution of the European Union"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-state stakeholders===
The freedom of thought enjoyed by non-state stakeholders enables them to formulate truly alternative ideas on world-governance issues, but they have taken little or no advantage of this opportunity.

Pierre Calame believes that "[n]on-state actors have always played an essential role in global regulation, but their role will grow considerably in this, the beginning of the twenty-first Century . . . Non-state actors play a key role in world governance in different domains . . . To better understand and develop the non-state actors' role, it should be studied in conjunction with the general principles of governance." "Non-state actors, due to their vocation, size, flexibility, methods of organization and action, interact with states in an equal manner; however this does not mean that their action is better adapted."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?rubrique37&amp;lang=en Calame, Pierre ; "Non-state Actors and World Governance"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144347/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?rubrique37&amp;lang=en |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One alternative idea encapsulated by many not-for-profit organisations relates to ideas in the '[[Human Potential Movement]]' and might be summarised as a mission statement along these lines: 'To create an accepted framework for all humankind, that is self-regulating and which enables every person to achieve their fullest potential in harmony with the world and its place in existence.'

Since the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, references to the universal collective of humanity have begun using the term 'humankind' rather than 'mankind', given the gender neutral quality of the former.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2682&amp;context=facpub Weiss, E.B. 2012. "The Coming Water Crisis: A Common Concern of Humankind"]. Transnational Environmental Law 1(1) 153-168, 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

'Self-regulation' is meant to invoke the concept of [[regulation]] which includes [[rule-making]] such as laws, and related ideas e.g. [[legal doctrine]] as well as other frameworks. However its scope is wider than this and intended to encompass [[cybernetics]] which allows for the study of regulation in as many varied contexts as possible from the [[regulation of gene expression]] to the [[Press Complaints Commission]] for example.

===World Religious Leaders===
Since 2005, religious leaders from a diverse array of faith traditions have engaged in dialogue with G8 leaders around issues of global governance and world risk. Drawing on the cultural capital of diverse religious traditions, they seek to strengthen democratic norms by influencing political leaders to include the interests of the most vulnerable when they make their decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/3/4/2158244013511830.full|title=SAGE Journals: Your gateway to world-class journal research|journal=Sage Open|volume=3|issue=4|pages=215824401351183|doi=10.1177/2158244013511830|year=2013|last1=Steiner|first1=Sherrie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have argued that religion is a key to transforming or fixing global governance.&lt;ref&gt;Page, J. 2015. [http://e-publications.une.edu.au/1959.11/18560 ''Fixing global governance''], Online Opinion, 29 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposals==
Several stakeholders have produced lists of proposals for a new world governance that is fairer, more responsible, solidarity-based, interconnected and respectful of the planet's diversity. Some examples are given below.

Joseph E. Stiglitz proposes a list of reforms related to the internal organization of international institutions and their external role in the framework of global-governance architecture. He also deals with global taxation, the management of global resources and the environment, the production and protection of global knowledge, and the need for a global legal infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, J.E. (2004), "The Future of Global Governance", in ''Initiative for Policy Dialogue (IPD)'', IPD Working Paper.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of other proposals are contained in the World Governance Proposal Paper: giving concrete expression to the principle of responsibility; granting civil society greater involvement in drawing up and implementing international regulations; granting national parliaments greater involvement in drawing up and implementing international regulations; re-equilibrating trade mechanisms and adopting regulations to benefit the southern hemisphere; speeding up the institution of regional bodies; extending and specifying the concept of the commons; redefining proposal and decision-making powers in order to reform the United Nations; developing independent observation, early-warning, and assessment systems; diversifying and stabilizing the basis for financing international collective action; and engaging in a wide-reaching process of consultation, a new Bretton Woods for the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alliance21.org/2003/article455.html|title=Redefining Global Governance to Meet the Challenges of (...)|author=|date=|website=www.alliance21.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This list provides more examples of proposals:
* the security of societies and its correlation with the need for global reforms——a controlled legally-based economy focused on stability, growth, full employment, and North-South convergence;
* equal rights for all, implying the institution of a global redistribution process;
* eradication of poverty in all countries;
* sustainable development on a global scale as an absolute imperative in political action at all levels;
* fight against the roots of terrorism and crime;
* consistent, effective, and fully democratic international institutions;
* Europe sharing its experience in meeting the challenges of globalization and adopting genuine partnership strategies to build a new form of multilateralism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article357 Groupe de réflexion "Europe-Mondialisation"; ''For Global Reform, a Social Democratic Approach to Globalization''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144357/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article357 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Rajesh Tandon, president of the FIM (Montreal International Forum) and of PRIA (Participatory Research in Asia), prepared a framework document entitled "Democratization of Global Governance for Global Democracy: Civil Society Visions and Strategies (G05) conference." He used the document to present five principles that could provide a basis for civil society actions: "Global institutions and agenda should be subjected to democratic political accountability."
* Democratic policy at the global level requires legitimacy of popular control through representative and direct mechanisms.
* Citizen participation in decision making at global levels requires equality of opportunity to all citizens of the world.
* Multiple spheres of governance, from local to provincial to national to regional and global, should mutually support democratization of decision making at all levels.
* Global democracy must guarantee that global public goods are equitably accessible to all citizens of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article195 Montréal International Forum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144412/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article195 |date=2011-10-04 }} ''Global Democracy: Civil Society Visions and Strategies (G05) Conference Report''&lt;/ref&gt;

Vijaya Ramachandran, Enrique Rueda-Sabater and Robin Kraft also define principles for representation of nations and populations in the system of global governance.  They propose a "Two Percent Club" that would provide for direct representation of nations with at least two percent of global population or global GDP; other nations would be represented within international fora through regional blocs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/122466878/abstract|title=Rethinking Fundamental Principles of Global Governance: How to Represent States and Populations in Multilateral Institutions|first1=VIJAYA|last1=RAMACHANDRAN|first2=ENRIQUE J.|last2=RUEDA-SABATER|first3=ROBIN|last3=KRAFT|date=1 July 2009|journal=Governance|volume=22|issue=3|pages=341–351|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0491.2009.01442.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic tool or discipline==
In the light of the unclear meaning of the term "global governance" as a concept in international politics,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas G. Weiss and Rorden Wilkinson (2014), "Rethinking Global Governance? Complexity, Authority, Power and Change", International Studies Quarterly, 58: 1, pp. 207-215&lt;/ref&gt; some authors have proposed defining it not in substantive, but in disciplinary and methodological terms. For these authors, global governance is better understood as an analytical concept or optic that provides a specific perspective on world politics different from that of conventional [[international relations]]&lt;ref&gt;K.Dingwerth and P.Pattberg, "Global Governance as a Perspective on World Politics", (2006) Global Governance vol. 12:198.&lt;/ref&gt; theory. [[Thomas G. Weiss]] and [[Rorden Wilkinson]] have even argued that global governance has the capacity to overcome some of the fragmentation of [[international relations]] as a discipline&lt;ref&gt;Thomas G. Weiss and Rorden Wilkinson 920140, "Global Governance to the Rescue: Saving International Relations?", Global Governance, 20: 1, pp. 19-36&lt;/ref&gt; particularly when understood as a set of questions about the governance of world orders.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas G. Weiss and Rorden Wilkinson (2019), Rethinking Global Governance, Cambridge: Polity. {{ISBN|9781509527243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some universities, including those offering courses in [[international relations]], have begun to establish degree programmes in global governance.

==Context==
{{Debate|date=January 2011}}
There are those who believe that world architecture depends on establishing a system of world governance. However, the equation is currently becoming far more complicated: Whereas the process used to be about regulating and limiting the individual power of states to avoid disturbing or overturning the status quo, the issue for today's world governance is to have a collective influence on the world's destiny by establishing a system for regulating the many interactions that lie beyond the province of state action. The political homogenization of the planet that has followed the advent of what is known as liberal democracy in its many forms should make it easier to establish a world governance system that goes beyond market laissez-faire and the democratic peace originally formulated by [[Immanuel Kant]], which constitutes a sort of geopolitical laissez-faire.

Another view regarding the establishment of global governance is based on the difficulties to achieve equitable development at the world scale. "To secure for all human beings in all parts of the world the conditions allowing a decent and meaningful life requires enormous human energies and far-reaching changes in policies. The task is all the more demanding as the world faces numerous other problems, each related to or even part of the development challenge, each similarly pressing, and each calling for the same urgent attention. But, as [[Arnold Toynbee]] has said, 'Our age is the first generation since the dawn of history in which mankind dares to believe it practical to make the benefits of civilization available to the whole human race'."&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0010/001055/105586e.pdf UNESCO (1996), ''Our Creative Diversity: Report of the World Commission on Culture and Development'', Summary Version, UNESCO, Paris.].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Need===
Because of the heterogeneity of preferences, which are enduring despite globalization, are often perceived as an implacable homogenization process. Americans and Europeans provide a good example of this point: on some issues they have differing common grounds in which the division between the public and private spheres still exist. Tolerance for inequalities and the growing demand for redistribution, attitudes toward risk, and over property rights vs human rights, set the stage. In certain cases, globalization even serves to accentuate differences rather than as a force for homogenization. Responsibility must play its part with respect to regional and International governments, when balancing the needs of its citizenry.

With the growing emergence of a global civic awareness, comes opposition to globalization and its effects. A rapidly growing number of movements and organizations have taken the debate to the international level. Although it may have limitations, this trend is one response to the increasing importance of world issues, that effect the planet.

=== Crisis of purpose ===
Pierre Jacquet, Jean Pisani-Ferry, and [[Laurence Tubiana]] argue that "[t]o ensure that decisions taken for international integration are sustainable, it is important that populations see the benefits, that states agree on their goals and that the institutions governing the process are seen as legitimate. These three conditions are only partially being met. Taklya"

The authors refer to a "crisis of purpose" and international institutions suffering from "imbalance" and inadequacy. They believe that for these institutions, "a gap has been created between the nature of the problems that need tackling and an institutional architecture which does not reflect the hierarchy of today's problems. For example, the environment has become a subject of major concern and central negotiation, but it does not have the institutional support that is compatible with its importance."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pisani-ferry.net/base/papiers/re-03-REF-gouvernance.pdf Pierre Jacquet; Jean Pisani-Ferry; Laurence Tubiana; ''À la recherche de la gouvernance mondiale''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905000313/http://www.pisani-ferry.net/base/papiers/re-03-REF-gouvernance.pdf |date=2008-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World government===
Global governance is not [[world government]], and even less [[democratic globalization]]. In fact, global governance would not be necessary, were there a world government. Domestic governments have monopolies on the use of force—the power of enforcement. Global governance refers to the political interaction that is required to solve problems that affect more than one state or region when there is no power to enforce compliance.  Problems arise, and networks of actors are constructed to deal with them in the absence of an international analogue to a domestic [[government]]. This system has been termed [[disaggregated sovereignty]].

===Consensus example===
Improved global problem solving need not involve the establishment of additional powerful formal global institutions. It does involve building consensus on norms and practices. One such area, currently under construction, is the development and improvement of accountability mechanisms. For example, the [[UN Global Compact]] brings together companies, UN agencies, labor organizations, and civil society to support universal environmental and social principles. Participation is entirely voluntary, and there is no enforcement of the principles by an outside regulatory body. Companies adhere to these practices both because they make economic sense, and because [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]], especially [[shareholders]], can monitor their compliance easily. Mechanisms such as the Global Compact can improve the ability of affected individuals and populations to hold companies accountable. However, corporations participating in the UN Global Compact have been criticized for their merely minimal standards, the absence of sanction-and-control measures, their lack of commitment to social and ecological standards, minimal acceptance among corporations around the world, and the high cost involved in reporting annually to small and medium-sized business&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.global-ethic-now.de/gen-eng/0d_weltethos-und-wirtschaft/0d-03-neue-art/0d-03-106-global-com-kritik.php A Global Ethic Now!; ''UN Global Compact Under Criticism'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bitcoin]] &amp; Beyond: [[Blockchain]]s, Globalization, and Global Governance workshop brings together an interdisciplinary group of researchers to examine the implications that blockchains pose for globalization and global governance.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.balsillieschool.ca/event/bitcoin-beyond-blockchains-globalization-and-global-governance. Balsillie School&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==

===Expansion of normative mechanisms and globalization of institutions===
One effect of globalization is the increasing regulation of businesses in the global marketplace. Jan Aart Scholte asserts, however, that these changes are inadequate to meet the needs: "Along with the general intensified globalization of social relations in contemporary history has come an unprecedented expansion of regulatory apparatuses that cover planetary jurisdictions and constituencies. On the whole, however, this global governance remains weak relative to pressing current needs for global public policy. Shortfalls in moral standing, legal foundations, material delivery, democratic credentials and charismatic leadership have together generated large legitimacy deficits in existing global regimes."&lt;ref&gt;Scholte, J.A. (2007), "Civil Society and the Legitimation of Global Governance", CSGR Working Paper No. 223/07&lt;/ref&gt;

Proposals and initiatives have been developed by various sources to set up networks and institutions operating on a global scale: political parties,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article14 Sehm-Patömaki, K. and M. Ulvila (2006), "Dialogues on Party Systems and Global Democratization"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004143624/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article14 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; unions,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article236 Howard, S. (2006), "Organising Globally"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004143648/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article236 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; regional authorities,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article231 Forum de réseaux de régions du monde (2007), "Déclaration des régions sur leur participation à la gouvernance de la mondialisation"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004143711/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article231 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and members of parliament in sovereign states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lipietz.net/spip.php?article1431|title=A quoi sert le Forum Parlementaire Mondial ?- Alain Lipietz|author=|date=|website=lipietz.net|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formulation and objectives===
One of the conditions for building a world democratic governance should be the development of platforms for citizen dialogue on the legal formulation of world governance and the harmonization of objectives.

This legal formulation could take the form of a Global Constitution. According to Pierre Calame and Gustavo Marin, "[a] Global Constitution resulting from a process for the institution of a global community will act as the common reference for establishing the order of rights and duties applicable to United Nations agencies and to the other multilateral institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the World Trade Organization."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alliance21.org/2003/article.php3?id_article=670|title=Main Points for the Discussion with the United Nations (...)|author=|date=|website=www.alliance21.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for formulating objectives, the necessary but insufficient ambition of the [[United Nations]] [[Millennium Development Goals]], which aim to safeguard humankind and the planet, and the huge difficulties in implementing them, illustrates the inadequacy of institutional initiatives that do not have popular support for having failed to invite citizens to take part in the elaboration process.

Furthermore, the Global Constitution "must clearly express a limited number of overall objectives that are to be the basis of global governance and are to guide the common action of the U.N. agencies and the multilateral institutions, where the specific role of each of these is subordinated to the pursuit of these common objectives."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Calame proposes the following objectives:
# instituting the conditions for sustainable development
# reducing inequalities
# establishing lasting peace while respecting diversity.&lt;ref&gt;Calame, P. (2003), ''La démocratie en miettes. Pour une révolution de la gouvernance'', Ed. Charles Léopold Mayer, Ed. Descartes et cie. p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reforming international institutions===
Is the UN capable of taking on the heavy responsibility of managing the planet's serious problems? More specifically, can the UN reform itself in such a way as to be able to meet this challenge? At a time when the financial crisis of 2008 is raising the same questions posed by the climate disasters of previous years regarding the unpredictable consequences of disastrous human management, can international financial institutions be reformed in such a way as to go back to their original task, which was to provide financial help to countries in need?

Lack of political will and citizen involvement at the international level has also brought about the submission of international institutions to the "[[neoliberal]]" agenda, particularly financial institutions such as the [[World Bank]], the [[International Monetary Fund]], and the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO).&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, Rorden (2014), What's Wrong with the WTO and How to Fix it, Cambridge: Polity. {{ISBN|978-0-745-67245-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pierre Calame gives an account of this development,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article16 Calame, Pierre; "Pour une gouvernance mondiale légitime, efficace et démocratique"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811144903/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article16 |date=2011-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while Joseph E. Stiglitz points out that the need for international institutions like the IMF, the World Bank, and the WTO has never been so great, but people's trust in them has never been so low.&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, Joseph E. (2006), "Global public goods and global finance: does global governance ensure that the global public interest is served?", ''in'' Jean-Philippe Touffut, (ed.), ''Advancing Public Goods'', Paris, pp. 149/164&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the key aspects of the United Nations reform is the problem of the representativeness of the General Assembly. The Assembly operates on the principle of "one state, one vote," so that states of hugely varying sizes have the same effect on the vote, which distorts representativeness and results in a major loss of credibility. Accordingly, "the General Assembly has lost any real capacity to influence. This means that the mechanisms for action and consultation organized by rich countries have the leading role."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Gustave Massiah advocates defining and implementing a radical reform of the UN. The author proposes building new foundations that can provide the basis for global democracy and the creation of a Global Social Contract, rooted in the respect and protection of civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights, as well as in the recognition of the strategic role of international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cadtm.org/spip.php?article1187|title=La réforme de l'ONU et le mouvement altermondialiste|author=|date=|website=www.cadtm.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The three ‘gaps’ in global governance===
There is the jurisdictional gap, between the increasing need for global governance in many areas - such as health - and the lack of an authority with the power, or jurisdiction, to take action.
Moreover, the gap of incentive between the need for international cooperation and the motivation to undertake it. The incentive gap is said to be closing as globalization provides increasing impetus for countries to cooperate. However, there are concerns that, as Africa lags further behind economically, its influence on global governance processes will diminish. At last, the participation gap, which refers to the fact that international cooperation remains primarily the affair of governments, leaving civil society groups on the fringes of policy-making. On the other hand, globalization of communication is facilitating the development of global civil society movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/trade/glossary/story038/en/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050225190757/http://www.who.int/trade/glossary/story038/en/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=25 February 2005|title=WHO - Global Governance|author=|date=25 February 2005|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The predominant agency associated with global health (and international health) is the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO). Other important agencies impacting global health include [[UNICEF]] and [[World Food Programme]]. The United Nations system has also played a part with cross-sectoral actions to address global health and its underlying socioeconomic determinants with the declaration of the [[Millennium Development Goals]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/ |title=Millennium Development Goals |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=2013-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the more recent [[Sustainable Development Goals]].

==Definition==

Global health employs several perspectives that focus on the determinants and distribution of health in international contexts:

* [[Medicine]] describes the pathology of diseases and promotes prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Weatherall, D. J., &amp; Clegg, J. B. (2001). Inherited haemoglobin disorders: an increasing global health problem. Bulletin of the World Health Organization, 79(8), 704-712.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Public health]] emphasizes the health of populations.&lt;ref&gt;Fried, L. P., Bentley, M. E., Buekens, P., Burke, D. S., Frenk, J. J., Klag, M. J., &amp; Spencer, H. C. (2010). Global health is public health. The Lancet, 375(9714), 535-537.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Epidemiology]] helps identify risk factors and causes of health problems.&lt;ref&gt;Ahern, M., Kovats, R. S., Wilkinson, P., Few, R., &amp; Matthies, F. (2005). Global health impacts of floods: epidemiologic evidence. Epidemiologic Reviews, 27(1), 36-46.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Demography]] provides data for policy decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Verano, J. W., &amp; Ubelaker, D. H. (1992). Disease and Demography in the Americas.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Economics]] emphasizes the cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit approaches for the optimal allocation of health resources.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, D., Cafiero, E., Jané-Llopis, E., Abrahams-Gessel, S., Bloom, L., Fathima, S., ... &amp; O’Farrell, D. (2012). The global economic burden of noncommunicable diseases. Program on the Global Demography of Aging.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Other social sciences such as [[sociology]], [[development studies]], [[psychology]], [[anthropology]], [[cultural studies]], and [[law]] can help understand the determinants of health in societies.

Both individuals and organizations working in the domain of global health often face many questions regarding [[ethics|ethical]] and [[human rights]]. Critical examination of the various causes and justifications of health inequities is necessary for the success of proposed solutions. Such issues are discussed at the bi-annual [https://www.globalsummit-berlin2016.de Global Summits of National Ethics/Bioethics Councils, next in March 2016 in Berlin], with experts from WHO and UNESCO, by invitation of the German Ethics Council.

==History==

{{see also|Timeline of global health}}

The 19th century held major discoveries in [[medicine]] and [[public health]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalhealthhub.org/timeline Global Health Timeline]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Broad Street cholera outbreak]] of 1854 was central to the development of modern [[epidemiology]]. The microorganisms responsible for [[malaria]] and [[tuberculosis]] were identified in 1880 and 1882, respectively. The 20th century saw the development of preventive and curative treatments for many diseases, including the [[BCG vaccine]] (for tuberculosis) and [[penicillin]] in the 1920s. The eradication of [[smallpox]], with the last naturally occurring case recorded in 1977, raised hope that other diseases could be eradicated as well.

Important steps were taken towards global cooperation in health with the formation of the [[United Nations]] (UN) and the [[World Bank Group]] in 1945, after [[World War II]]. In 1948, the member states of the newly formed United Nations gathered to create the [[World Health Organization]]. A cholera epidemic that took 20,000 lives in Egypt in 1947 and 1948 helped spur the international community to action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of WHO|author=World Health Organization|url=http://www.who.int/library/historical/access/who/index.en.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061207150944/http://www.who.int/library/historical/access/who/index.en.shtml|archivedate=2006-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO published its [[WHO Model List of Essential Medicines|Model List of Essential Medicines]], and the 1978 [[Alma Ata declaration]] underlined the importance of [[primary health care]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=Primary Health Care: Report of the International Conference on Primary Health Care|location=Geneva|publisher=World Health Organization|year=1978|url=http://www.unicef.org/about/history/files/Alma_Ata_conference_1978_report.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a United Nations Summit in 2000, member nations declared eight [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs), which reflected the major challenges facing human development globally, to be achieved by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Resolution adopted by the General Assembly, 55/2|date=18 September 2000|publisher=United Nations|url=https://www.un.org/millennium/declaration/ares552e.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The declaration was matched by unprecedented global investment by donor and recipient countries. According to the UN, these MDGs provided an important framework for development and significant progress has been made in a number of areas.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, progress has been uneven and some of the MDGs were not fully realized including maternal, newborn and child health and reproductive health.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Building on the MDGs, a new Sustainable Development Agenda with 17 [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs) has been established for the years 2016-2030.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The first goal being an ambitious and historic pledge to end poverty.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 September 2015, the 193 countries of the UN General Assembly adopted the 2030 Development Agenda titled ''Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 2015 a book titled "[[To Save Humanity]]" was published, with nearly 100 essays regarding today's most pressing global health issues.&lt;ref&gt;S.J. Hoffman. 2011. "Ending Medical Complicity in State-Sponsored Torture," The Lancet 378(9802): 1535-1537. doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60816-7.&lt;/ref&gt; The essays were authored by global figures in politics, science, and advocacy ranging from [[Bill Clinton]] to [[Peter Piot]], and addressed a wide range of issues including vaccinations, [[antimicrobial resistance]], health coverage, tobacco use, research methodology, [[climate change]], equity, access to medicine, and media coverage of health research.

==Measures==

Measures of global health include [[disability-adjusted life year]] (DALY), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and [[mortality rate]].&lt;ref name="etches2006"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Etches V, Frank J, Di Ruggiero E, Manuel D |title=Measuring population health: a review of indicators |journal=Annu Rev Public Health |volume=27 |issue= |pages=29–55 |year=2006 |pmid=16533108 |doi=10.1146/annurev.publhealth.27.021405.102141 |url=http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.publhealth.27.021405.102141?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed|last2=Frank |last3=Di Ruggiero |last4=Manuel }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disability-adjusted life years===

{{legend|#cb0000|Over 80000}}
&lt;/div&gt;]]
{{Main|Disability-adjusted life year}}
The DALY is a summary measure that combines the impact of [[illness]], [[disability]], and mortality by measuring the time lived with disability and the time lost due to premature mortality. One DALY can be thought of as one lost year of "healthy" life. The DALY for a disease is the sum of the years of life lost due to premature mortality and the years lost due to disability for incident cases of the health condition.

===Quality-adjusted life years===
{{Main|Quality-adjusted life year}}
QALYs combine expected survival with expected quality of life into a single number: if an additional year of healthy life is worth a value of one (year), then a year of less healthy life is worth less than one (year). QALY calculations are based on measurements of the value that individuals place on expected years of survival. Measurements can be made in several ways: by techniques that simulate gambles about preferences for alternative states of health, with surveys or analyses that infer willingness to pay for alternative states of health, or through instruments that are based on trading off some or all likely survival time that a medical intervention might provide in order to gain less survival time of higher quality.&lt;ref name="etches2006" /&gt;

===Infant and child mortality===
{{Main|Infant mortality|Child mortality}}
Infant mortality and child mortality for children under age 5 are more specific than DALYs or QALYs in representing the health in the poorest sections of a population, and are thus especially useful when focusing on [[health equity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mulholland E, Smith L, Carneiro I, Becher H, Lehmann D |title=Equity and child-survival strategies |journal=Bull. World Health Organ. |volume=86 |issue=5 |pages=399–407 |date=May 2008 |pmid=18545743 |pmc=2647438 |url=http://www.scielosp.org/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0042-96862008000500018&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en |doi=10.2471/BLT.07.044545|last2=Smith |last3=Carneiro |last4=Becher |last5=Lehmann }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Morbidity===
{{Main|Morbidity}}
Morbidity measures include [[incidence rate]], [[prevalence]], and [[cumulative incidence]], with incidence rate referring to the risk of developing a new health condition within a specified period of time. Although sometimes loosely expressed simply as the number of new cases during a time period, morbidity is better expressed as a proportion or a rate.

==Health conditions==
The diseases and health conditions targeted by global health initiatives are sometimes grouped under "[[diseases of poverty]]" versus "[[diseases of affluence]]", although the impact of globalization is increasingly blurring the lines between the two.

===Respiratory infections===
Infections of the respiratory tract and middle ear are major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide.&lt;ref name="Lopez AD 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lopez AD, Mathers CD, Ezzati M, Jamison DT, Murray CJ |title=Global and regional burden of disease and risk factors, 2001: systematic analysis of population health data |journal=Lancet |volume=367 |issue=9524 |pages=1747–57 |date=May 2006 |pmid=16731270 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68770-9 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(06)68770-9|last2=Mathers |last3=Ezzati |last4=Jamison |last5=Murray }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some respiratory infections of global significance include [[tuberculosis]], [[measles]], [[influenza]], and [[pneumonia]]s caused by [[pneumococci]] and ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]''. The spread of respiratory infections is exacerbated by crowded conditions, and poverty is associated with more than a 20-fold increase in the relative burden of lung infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mizgerd JP |year=2006 |title=Lung Infection—A Public Health Priority |journal=PLoS Med |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages= e76|publisher= |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0030076 |pmid= 16401173|pmc= 1326257|url=http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pmed.0030076 |accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diarrheal diseases===
[[Diarrhea]] is the second most common cause of child mortality worldwide, responsible for 17% of deaths of children under age 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.childinfo.org/709.htm |title=Statistics by Area – Diarrhoeal disease – The challenge |publisher=UNICEF |accessdate=2013-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poor [[sanitation]] can increase transmission of bacteria and viruses through water, food, utensils, hands, and flies. Dehydration due to diarrhea can be effectively treated through [[oral rehydration therapy]] with dramatic reductions in mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Taylor CE, Greenough WB |title=Control of diarrheal diseases |journal=Annu Rev Public Health |volume=10 |issue= |pages=221–44 |year=1989 |pmid=2655632 |doi=10.1146/annurev.pu.10.050189.001253 |url=http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.pu.10.050189.001253?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed|last2=Greenough Wb }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Victora CG, Bryce J, Fontaine O, Monasch R |title=Reducing deaths from diarrhoea through oral rehydration therapy |journal=Bull.

While hygienic measures alone may be insufficient for the prevention of rotavirus diarrhea,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rotavirusvaccine.org/documents/WHO_position_paper_rotavirus_2007_000.pdf |title=Rotavirus Vaccine Access and Delivery - PATH |publisher=Rotavirusvaccine.org |date=2011-12-07 |accessdate=2013-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091222043141/http://www.rotavirusvaccine.org/documents/WHO_position_paper_rotavirus_2007_000.pdf |archivedate=2009-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; it can be prevented by a safe and potentially cost-effective vaccine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Valencia-Mendoza A, Bertozzi SM, Gutierrez JP, Itzler R |title=Cost-effectiveness of introducing a rotavirus vaccine in developing countries: the case of Mexico |journal=BMC Infect.

===Maternal health===
[[Image:Merlin Maternal.jpg|thumb|Maternal health clinic in Afghanistan (source: [[Merlin]])]]
{{Main|Maternal health|Reproductive health}}
[[Complications of pregnancy]] and [[childbirth]] are the leading causes of [[maternal mortality|death among women]] of reproductive age in many developing countries: a woman dies from complications from childbirth approximately every minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/mdg/maternal.html|publisher=UNICEF|title=Improve Maternal Health}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the World Health Organization's 2005 [[World Health Report]], poor maternal conditions are the fourth leading cause of death for women worldwide, after HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=World Health Organization|year=2005|title=World Health Report 2005: make every mother and child count|location=Geneva|url=http://www.who.int/whr/2005/en/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most maternal deaths and injuries can be prevented, and such deaths have been largely eradicated in the [[developed world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/02/100218092852.htm|work=Science Daily|title=Most Maternal Deaths in Sub-Saharan Africa Could Be Avoided|date= 2 March 2010|accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Targets for improving maternal health include increasing the number of  deliveries accompanied by skilled [[birth attendant]]s.&lt;ref name=bhutta2008 /&gt;

68 low-income countries tracked by the WHO- and UNICEF-led collaboration ''Countdown to 2015'' are estimated to hold for 97% of worldwide maternal and child deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.countdown2015mnch.org/reports-publications|work=Countdown to 2015|title=Progress reports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HIV/AIDS===
{{Main|HIV|AIDS|}}
The HIV/AIDS epidemic has highlighted the global nature of human health and welfare and globalisation has given rise to a trend toward finding common solutions to global health challenges. Numerous international funds have been set up in recent times to address global health challenges such as HIV. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://globalizationandhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1744-8603-1-13|title=HIV/AIDS: global trends, global funds and delivery bottlenecks|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;Since the beginning of the epidemic, more than 70 million people have been infected with the HIV virus and about 35 million people have died of HIV. Globally, 36.9 million [31.1–43.9 million] people were living with HIV at the end of 2017. An estimated 0.8% [0.6-0.9%] of adults aged 15–49 years worldwide are living with HIV, although the burden of the epidemic continues to vary considerably between countries and regions. The WHO African region remains most severely affected, with nearly 1 in every 25 adults (4.1%) living with HIV and accounting for nearly two-thirds of the people living with HIV worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/gho/hiv/en/|title=HIV/AIDS|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is transmitted through unprotected sex, unclean needles, blood transfusions, and from mother to child during birth or lactation. Globally, HIV is primarily spread through sexual intercourse. The risk-per-exposure with vaginal sex in low-income countries from female to male is 0.38% and male to female is 0.3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aidsmap.com/Estimated-risk-per-exposure/page/1324038/#item1324093|title=Estimated HIV transmission risk per exposure for specific activities and events|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;The infection damages the immune system, leading to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and eventually, death. [[Management of HIV/AIDS|Antiretroviral drugs]] prolong life and delay the onset of AIDS by minimizing the amount of HIV in the body.

===Malaria===
{{Main|Malaria}}
Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease caused by the parasites of the genus ''[[Plasmodium]]''. Symptoms may include fever, headaches, chills, and nausea. Each year, there are approximately 500 million cases of malaria worldwide, most commonly among children and pregnant women in developing countries.&lt;ref name="Birn"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Birn, A., Pillay |author2=Yogan, Holtz, T. |year=2009|title=Textbook of International Health|edition=3rd|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=273|isbn=9780199719853}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO African Region carries a disproportionately high share of the global malaria burden. In 2016, the region was home to 90% of malaria cases and 91% of malaria deaths. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria|title=Malaria key facts|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;The use of [[Mosquito net|insecticide-treated bednets]] is a cost-effective way to reduce deaths from malaria, as is prompt [[artemisinin]]-based combination therapy, supported by [[intermittent preventive therapy]] in pregnancy. International travellers to [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] zones are advised [[chemoprophylaxis]] with [[antimalarial drugs]] like Atovaquone-proguanil, doxycycline, or mefloquine&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/travelers/country_table/a.html|title=CDC - Malaria - Travelers - Malaria Information and Prophylaxis, by Country|last=Prevention|first=CDC - Centers for Disease Control and|date=2018-01-26|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nutrition===

===Violence against women===
{{Main|Domestic violence}}
[[Violence against women]] has been defined as: "physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family and in the general community, including battering, sexual abuse of children, dowry-related violence, rape, [[female genital mutilation]] and other traditional practices harmful to women, non-spousal violence and violence related to exploitation, sexual harassment and intimidation at work, in educational institutions and elsewhere, trafficking in women, forced prostitution and violence perpetrated or condoned by the state."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The United Nations Population Fund|year=2005|title=Violence Against Women Fact Sheet|url=http://www.unfpa.org/swp/2005/presskit/factsheets/facts_vaw.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to causing injury, violence may increase "women’s long-term risk of a number of other health problems, including chronic pain, physical disability, drug and alcohol abuse, and depression".&lt;ref&gt;Ellsberg M, and Heise L. Researching Violence Against Women: A Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists. Washington DC, United States: World Health Organization, PATH; 2005. Accessed September 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although statistics can be difficult to obtain as many cases go unreported, it is estimated that one in every five women faces some form of violence during her lifetime, in some cases leading to serious injury or even death.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. Addressing violence against women and achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Geneva, Switzerland: World Health Organization; 2005. Retrieved from http://www.who.int/gender/documents/MDGs&amp;VAWSept05.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Risk factors for being a perpetrator include low education, past exposure to child maltreatment or witnessing violence between parents, harmful use of alcohol, attitudes accepting of violence and gender inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=World Health Organization|year=2011|title=Violence against women: Intimate partner and sexual violence against women fact sheet|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs239/en/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equality of women has been addressed in the [[Millennium development goals]].

===Chronic disease===
{{Main|Non-communicable disease}}
Approximately 80% of deaths linked to non-communicable diseases occur in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=WHO: Global Status Report on Noncommunicable Diseases 2010|year=2011| url=http://www.who.int/nmh/publications/ncd_report2010/en/}}&lt;/ref&gt;For instance, urbanization and aging have led to increasing poor health conditions related to non-communicable diseases in India. The fastest-growing causes of disease burden over the last 26 years were diabetes (rate increased by 80%) and ischemic heart disease (up 34%). More than 60% of deaths, about 6.1 million, in 2016 were due to NCDs, up from about 38% in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.healthdata.org/news-release/comprehensive-health-study-india-finds-rise-non-communicable-diseases|title=Comprehensive health study in India finds rise of non-communicable diseases|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increases in refugee urbanization, has led to a growing number of people diagnosed with chronic noncommunicable diseases.&lt;ref name="amara"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Amara | first=Ahmed Hassan | last2=Aljunid | first2=Syed Mohamed | title=Noncommunicable diseases among urban refugees and asylum-seekers in developing countries: a neglected health care need | journal=Globalization and health | year=2014 | pmid=24708876 | pmc=3978000 | volume=10 | pages=24 | doi=10.1186/1744-8603-10-24 | issn=1744-8603 | url=http://www.globalizationandhealth.com/content/10/1/24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the rate of [[Diabetes mellitus|type 2 diabetes]], associated with [[obesity]], has been on the rise in countries previously plagued by hunger. In low-income countries, the number of individuals with diabetes is expected to increase from 84 million to 228 million by 2030.&lt;ref name="nejm"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hossain P, Kawar B, El Nahas M |title=Obesity and diabetes in the developing world—a growing challenge |journal=N.

Many populations face an "outcome gap", which refers to the gap between members of a population who have access to medical treatment versus those who do not.

Journalist [[Laurie Garrett]] argues that the field of global health is not plagued by a lack of funds, but that more funds do not always translate into positive outcomes. The problem lies in the way these funds are allocated, as they are often disproportionately allocated to alleviating a single disease.&lt;ref name="Garrett, Laurie 2007"&gt;{{cite web|author=Garrett, Laurie|year=2007|title=The Challenge of Global Health|work=Foreign Affairs|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/62268/laurie-garrett/the-challenge-of-global-health}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) is "a multilateral, multi-sector effort that includes 60 participating countries and numerous private and public international organizations focused on building up worldwide health security capabilities toward meeting such threats" as the spread of infectious disease. On March 26-28, 2018, the GHSA held its last high-level meeting which was located in Tbilisi, Georgia on biosurveillance of infectious disease threats, "which include such modern-day examples as HIV/AIDS, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), H1N1 influenza, multi-drug resistant tuberculosis — any emerging or reemerging disease that threatens human health and global economic stability."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://homelandprepnews.com/countermeasures/27450-u-s-critical-juncture-global-health-security-agenda/|title=U.S. at critical juncture with Global Health Security Agenda|last=Riley|first=Kim|date=2018-03-21|work=Homeland Preparedness News|access-date=2018-03-23|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This event brought together GHSA partner countries, contributing countries of Real-Time Surveillance Action Package, and international partner organizations supporting the strengthening of capacities to detect infectious disease threats within the Real-Time Surveillance Action Package and other cross-cutting packages.

It describes and explains the flow of news from one country to another.&lt;ref name="segev"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.peterlang.com/view/product/31394|title=International News Online: Global Views with Local Perspectives|last=Segev|first=Elad|publisher=Peter Lang|year=2016|isbn=9781433129841|location=New York|page=139-153|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The unequal representation of the world and the under-representation of [[developing countries]] have been already of a great concern at least since the 1950s, since they influence the way people perceive the world and the image of countries.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO (1954). How Nations See Each Other? Paris: UNESCO Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; This problem was later addressed in the [[MacBride report]], and his set of recommendations for a [[New World Information and Communication Order]]. The unequal representation of the world has been also linked to the [[World System Theory]], and the unequal economic structure of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Chang, T. K. (1998).

Economically powerful countries, as well as their opponent countries (mainly in the Middle East and Asia) get the most news coverage around the world.

'''Globalization''' [[-ise vs -ize|or]] '''[[wiktionary:globalisation#English|globalisation]]''' is the process  of [[foreign relations|interaction]] and integration between people, companies, and governments [[world]]wide. Globalization has grown due to advances in [[transportation]] and [[communication]] technology. With increased global interactions comes the growth of international [[trade]], [[idea]]s, and [[culture]]. Globalization is primarily an economic process of interaction and integration that's associated with social and cultural aspects. However, [[wiktionary:conflict|conflicts]] and [[diplomacy]] are also large parts of the [[history of globalization]], and modern globalization.

Economically, globalization involves goods and services, and the economic resources of capital, technology, and data.&lt;ref name="Albrow"&gt;Albrow, Martin and Elizabeth King (eds.) (1990).

All of these improvements have been major factors in globalization and have generated further [[interdependence]] of [[Economy|economic]] and cultural activities around the globe.&lt;ref name="Imagining"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.elon.edu/e-web/predictions/150/1830.xhtml | title=Imagining the Internet | publisher=Elon University School of Communications | work=History of Information Technologies | accessdate=17 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stever_1972"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stever | first1 = H.

Though many scholars place the [[History of globalization|origins of globalization]] in [[modernity|modern times]], others trace its history long before the [[Europe]]an [[Age of Discovery]] and voyages to the [[New World]], some even to the third millennium BC.&lt;ref name="GL-H-09" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GL-H-10"&gt;{{cite web |title=Globalization and Global History |page=127 |url=http://58.192.114.227/humanities/sociology/htmledit/uploadfile/system/20110522/20110522005012939.pdf |accessdate=3 July 2012 }}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Large-scale globalization began in the 1820s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=H.|first=O'Rourke, Kevin|last2=G.|first2=Williamson, Jeffrey|date=1 April 2002|title=When did globalisation begin?|url=https://academic.oup.com/ereh/article-abstract/6/1/23/540507|journal=European Review of Economic History|language=en|volume=6|issue=1|doi=10.1017/S1361491602000023|issn=1361-4916|pages=23–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 19th century and early 20th century, the connectivity of the world's economies and cultures grew very quickly.

In 2000, the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) identified four basic aspects of globalization: [[trade]] and [[Financial transaction|transactions]], [[capital (economics)|capital]] and [[investment]] movements, [[Human migration|migration]] and movement of people, and the dissemination of knowledge.&lt;ref name="12th April 2000: IMF Publications"&gt;International Monetary Fund .

==Etymology and usage==
The term ''globalization'' derives from the word ''globalize'', which refers to the emergence of an international network of economic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Globalization|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=globalization|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest known usages of the term as a noun was in a 1930 publication entitled ''Towards New Education'', where it denoted a holistic view of human experience in education.&lt;ref name=oed&gt;{{cite web|title=Globalization|work=Oxford English Dictionary Online|url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50297775?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=Globalization&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10|date=September 2009|accessdate=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'globalization' had been used in its economic sense at least as early as 1981, and in other senses since at least as early as 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/06/business/06levitt.html | title=Theodore Levitt, 81, Who Coined the Term 'Globalization', Is Dead | date=6 July 2006 | accessdate=23 April 2014 | author=Feder, Barnaby J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theodore Levitt is credited with popularizing the term and bringing it into the mainstream business audience in the later half of the 1980s. Since its inception, the concept of globalization has inspired competing definitions and interpretations. Its antecedents date back to the great movements of trade and [[empire]] across [[Asia]] and the [[Indian Ocean]] from the 15th century onward.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, A.G. (ed.). (2004). ''Globalization in World History.'' London: Norton, pp. 4–8. {{ISBN|978-0393979428}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bakari13"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bakari|first=Mohamed El-Kamel|title=Globalization and Sustainable Development: False Twins?|journal=New Global Studies|volume=7|issue=3|pages=23–56|issn=1940-0004|doi=10.1515/ngs-2013-021|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Due to the complexity of the concept, various research projects, articles, and discussions often stay focused on a single aspect of globalization.&lt;ref name="GCSP"&gt;Al-Rodhan, R.F. Nayef and Gérard Stoudmann. (2006). [http://www.sustainablehistory.com/articles/definitions-of-globalization.pdf Definitions of the Globalization: A Comprehensive Overview and a Proposed Definition.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119215401/http://www.sustainablehistory.com/articles/definitions-of-globalization.pdf|date=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sociology|Sociologists]] [[Martin Albrow]] and Elizabeth King define globalization as "all those processes by which the people of the world are incorporated into a single world society."&lt;ref name="Albrow" /&gt; In ''The Consequences of Modernity'', [[Anthony Giddens]] writes: "Globalization can thus be defined as the intensification of worldwide [[social relation]]s which link distant localities in such a way that local happenings are shaped by events occurring many miles away and vice versa."&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, Anthony. (1991). ''The Consequences of Modernity'' Cambridge: Polity Press. p. 64. {{ISBN|9780745609232}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, [[Roland Robertson]], professor of sociology at the [[University of Aberdeen]] and an early writer in the field, described globalization as "the compression of the world and the intensification of the consciousness of the world as a whole."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Globalization : social theory and global culture|last=Robertson|first=Roland|publisher=Sage|year=1992|isbn=0803981872|edition= Reprint.|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Global Transformations'', [[David Held]] and his co-writers state:
{{quote|text=Although in its simplistic sense globalization refers to the widening, deepening and speeding up of global interconnection, such a definition begs further elaboration. ... Globalization can be on a continuum with the local, national and regional. At one end of the continuum lie social and economic relations and networks which are organized on a local and/or national basis; at the other end lie social and economic relations and networks which crystallize on the wider scale of regional and global interactions. Globalization can refer to those spatial-temporal processes of change which underpin a transformation in the organization of human affairs by linking together and expanding human activity across regions and continents. Without reference to such expansive spatial connections, there can be no clear or coherent formulation of this term. ... A satisfactory definition of globalization must capture each of these elements: extensity (stretching), intensity, velocity and impact.&lt;ref&gt;Held, David; Goldblatt, David; McGrew, Anthony; Perraton, Jonathan (1999). ''Global Transformations'' Cambridge: Polity Press. {{ISBN|9780745614984}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=|}}

Held and his co-writers' definition of globalization in that same book as "transformation in the spatial organization of social relations and transactions—assessed in terms of their extensity, intensity, velocity and impact—generating transcontinental or inter-regional flows" was called "probably the most widely-cited definition" in the 2014 [[Pankaj Ghemawat|DHL Global Connectiveness Index]].&lt;ref name="DHL"/&gt;

Swedish journalist Thomas Larsson, in his book ''The Race to the Top: The Real Story of Globalization'', states that globalization:
{{quote|is the process of world shrinkage, of distances getting shorter, things moving closer. It pertains to the increasing ease with which somebody on one side of the world can interact, to mutual benefit, with somebody on the other side of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Larsson, Thomas. (2001). ''The Race to the Top: The Real Story of Globalization'' Washington, D.C.: Cato Institute. p. 9. {{ISBN|978-1930865150}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] defines globalization with a more direct and historically contextualized emphasis:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Globalization is the extension of social relations across world-space, defining that world-space in terms of the historically variable ways that it has been practiced and socially understood through changing world-time.&lt;ref name=James2005&gt;{{Cite journal | year=2005 | last=James |first=Paul | title=  ‘Arguing Globalizations: Propositions Towards an Investigation of Global Formation’ | url= https://www.academia.edu/5246805/Arguing_Globalizations_Propositions_Towards_an_Investigation_of_Global_Formation | journal= Globalizations | volume= 2 | issue=  2 | pages=193–209 | doi=10.1080/14747730500202206}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Manfred Steger]], professor of [[global studies]] and research leader in the [[Global Cities Institute]] at [[RMIT University]], identifies four main empirical [[dimensions of globalization]]: economic, political, cultural, and [[Ecology|ecological]]. A fifth dimension—the ideological—cutting across the other four. The ideological dimension, according to Steger, is filled with a range of [[Norm (social)|norms]], claims, beliefs, and narratives about the phenomenon itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Globalization: A Very Short Introduction|last=Steger|first=Manfred|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-19-955226-9|location=New York|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James and Steger stated that the concept of globalization "emerged from the intersection of four interrelated sets of '[[Community of practice|communities of practice]]' ([[Étienne Wenger|Wenger]], 1998): academics, journalists, publishers/editors, and librarians."&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com" /&gt;{{Rp|424}} They note the term was used "in education to describe the global life of the mind"; in [[international relations]] to describe the extension of the [[European Economic Community|European Common Market]]; and in journalism to describe how the "American Negro and his problem are taking on a global significance".&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com" /&gt; They have also argued that four different forms of globalization can be distinguished that complement and cut across the solely empirical dimensions.&lt;ref name=James2005/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2013|title=‘Levels of Subjective Globalization: Ideologies, Imaginaries, Ontologies’|url=https://www.academia.edu/4311113/Levels_of_Subjective_Globalization_Ideologies_Imaginaries_Ontologies|journal=Perspectives on Global Development and Technology|volume=12|issue=1–2|author1=Manfred B. Steger|author2=Paul James}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to James, the oldest dominant form of globalization is embodied globalization, the movement of people. A second form is agency-extended globalization, the circulation of agents of different institutions, organizations, and [[Polity|polities]], including [[Imperialism|imperial]] agents. Object-extended globalization, a third form, is the movement of [[Commodity|commodities]] and other objects of exchange. He calls the transmission of ideas, images, knowledge, and information across world-space disembodied globalization, maintaining that it is currently the dominant form of globalization. James holds that this series of distinctions allows for an understanding of how, today, the most embodied forms of globalization such as the movement of [[refugee]]s and [[Immigration|migrants]] are increasingly restricted, while the most disembodied forms such as the circulation of financial instruments and codes are the most [[Deregulation|deregulated]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|year=2014|title=‘Faces of Globalization and the Borders of States: From Asylum Seekers to Citizens’|url=https://www.academia.edu/7773440/Faces_of_Globalization_and_the_Borders_of_States_From_Asylum_Seekers_to_Citizens|journal=Citizenship Studies|volume=18|issue=2|pages=208–23|doi=10.1080/13621025.2014.886440|pmid=|access-date=|via=|last1=James|first1=Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The journalist [[Thomas L. Friedman]] popularized the term [[The World Is Flat|"flat world"]], arguing that [[Global trade|globalized trade]], [[outsourcing]], [[supply chain|supply-chaining]], and political forces had permanently changed the world, for better and worse. He asserted that the pace of globalization was quickening and that its impact on business organization and practice would continue to grow.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Thomas L. "The Dell Theory of Conflict Prevention". ''Emerging: A Reader.'' Ed. Barclay Barrios. Boston: Bedford, St. Martins, 2008. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Takis Fotopoulos]] defined "economic globalization" as the opening and deregulation of [[Commodity market|commodity]], [[Capital market|capital]], and [[Labour economics|labor markets]] that led toward present [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] globalization. He used "political globalization" to refer to the emergence of a transnational [[élite]] and a phasing out of the [[nation-state]]. Meanwhile, he used "cultural globalization" to reference the worldwide homogenization of culture. Other of his usages included "[[Ideology|ideological]] globalization", "[[Technology|technological]] globalization", and "social globalization".&lt;ref&gt;Fotopoulos, Takis. (2001). "Globalization, the reformist Left and the Anti-Globalization 'Movement.'" [http://www.inclusivedemocracy.org/dn/vol7/takis_globalisation.htm ''Democracy &amp; Nature: The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy'', 7:(2) (July 2001).]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lechner and Boli (2012) define globalization as more people across large distances becoming connected in more and different ways.&lt;ref&gt;Lechner,  Frank J. and John Boli (eds.) (2011). ''The Globalization Reader.'' New Jersey: Wiley-Blackwell Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Globophobia" is used to refer to the fear of globalization, though it can also mean the [[balloon phobia|fear of balloons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Henwood|first1=Doug|title=Beyond Globophobia|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/beyond-globophobia|work=[[The Nation]]|date=1 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clark|first1=Ross|title=Globophobia|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/columnists/12049/globophobia-17/|work=[[The Spectator]]|date=20 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008"&gt;{{cite book|editor=George Ritzer|editorlink=George Ritzer|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=XKnmvRATtfAC|page=16}}|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|pages=16–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of globalization}}
{{See also|Timeline of international trade}}

There are both [[Proximate and ultimate causation|distal and proximate causes]] which can be traced in the historical factors affecting globalization. Large-scale globalization began in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="When Did Globalization Begin"&gt;{{cite journal |last=O'Rourke |first=Kevin H. |first2=Jeffrey G. |last2=Williamson |year=2002 |title=When Did Globalization Begin? |journal=European Review of Economic History |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=23–50 |doi=10.1017/S1361491602000023 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archaic===
[[File:Archaic globalization.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.8|The 13th century world-system, as described by [[Janet Abu-Lughod]]]]
{{Main|Archaic globalization}}

Archaic globalization conventionally refers to a phase in the history of globalization including globalizing events and developments from the time of the earliest [[civilization]]s until roughly the 1600s. This term is used to describe the relationships between communities and [[State (polity)|states]] and how they were created by the geographical spread of ideas and social norms at both local and regional levels.&lt;ref name="M 45"&gt;{{cite book|last=Martell|first=Luke|title=The Sociology of Globalization|year=2010|publisher=Policy Press.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this schema, three main prerequisites are posited for globalization to occur. The first is the idea of Eastern Origins, which shows how [[Western world|Western states]] have adapted and implemented learned principles from the [[Eastern world|East]].&lt;ref name="M 45"/&gt; Without the spread of traditional ideas from the East, Western globalization would not have emerged the way it did. The second is distance. The interactions of states were not on a global scale and most often were confined to Asia, [[North Africa]], the [[Middle East]], and certain parts of Europe.&lt;ref name="M 45"/&gt; With early globalization, it was difficult for states to interact with others that were not within a close proximity. Eventually, technological advances allowed states to learn of others' existence and thus another phase of globalization can occur. The third has to do with inter-dependency, stability, and regularity. If a state is not dependent on another, then there is no way for either state to be mutually affected by the other. This is one of the driving forces behind global connections and trade; without either, globalization would not have emerged the way it did and states would still be dependent on their own [[Production (economics)|production]] and resources to work. This is one of the arguments surrounding the idea of early globalization. It is argued that archaic globalization did not function in a similar manner to modern globalization because states were not as interdependent on others as they are today.&lt;ref name="M 45"/&gt;

Also posited is a "multi-polar" nature to archaic globalization, which involved the active participation of non-Europeans. Because it predated the [[Great Divergence]] of the nineteenth century, where [[Western Europe]] pulled ahead of the rest of the world in terms of [[industrial production]] and [[Output (economics)|economic output]], archaic globalization was a phenomenon that was driven not only by Europe but also by other economically developed [[Old World]] centers such as [[Gujarat]], [[Bengal]], coastal [[China]], and [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Hans Köchler|Kochler]]|first=Hans|title=Globality versus Democracy: The Changing Nature of International Relations in the Era of Globalization|year=2000|publisher=International Progress Organization|location=Vienna|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:NanbanCarrack.jpg|thumb|right|Portuguese [[carrack]] in [[Nagasaki]], 17th-century Japanese [[Nanban trade|Nanban art]]]]

The German [[Economic history|historical economist]] and sociologist [[Andre Gunder Frank]] argues that a form of globalization began with the rise of trade links between [[Sumer]] and the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] in the third millennium [[Common Era|B.C.E.]]  This archaic globalization existed during the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic Age]], when commercialized urban centers enveloped the axis of [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] culture that reached from [[India]] to [[Spain]], including [[Alexandria]] and the other [[Alexander the Great|Alexandrine]] cities. Early on, the geographic position of Greece and the necessity of [[import]]ing wheat forced the Greeks to engage in maritime trade. Trade in ancient Greece was largely unrestricted: the state controlled only the supply of grain.&lt;ref name="GL-H-09"&gt;Frank, Andre Gunder. (1998). ''ReOrient: Global economy in the Asian age.''

Trade on the [[Silk Road]] was a significant factor in the development of civilizations from China, [[South Asian history|Indian subcontinent]], [[Persia]], Europe, and [[Arabia]], opening long-distance political and economic interactions between them.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Bentley, Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Though silk was certainly the major trade item from China, common goods such as salt and sugar were traded as well; and [[religion]]s, [[syncretic]] philosophies, and various technologies, as well as [[disease]]s, also traveled along the Silk Routes. In addition to economic trade, the Silk Road served as a means of carrying out cultural trade among the civilizations along its network.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Bentley, Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The movement of people, such as refugees, artists, craftsmen, [[Missionary|missionaries]], robbers, and envoys, resulted in the exchange of religions, art, [[language]]s, and new technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/legacy-silk-road | title = The Legacy of the Silk Road | publisher = Yale Global | date = 25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early modern===
{{Main|Proto-globalization}}

"[[Early modern period|Early modern]]-" or "proto-globalization" covers a period of the history of globalization roughly spanning the years between 1600 and 1800. The concept of "proto-globalization" was first introduced by [[historian]]s [[A. G. Hopkins]] and [[Christopher Bayly]]. The term describes the phase of increasing trade links and cultural exchange that characterized the period immediately preceding the advent of high "modern globalization" in the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, A.G., ed., 2003. Globalization in World History. New York City, NY: Norton. {{ISBN|0-393-97942-3}} pp. 4–5, 7&lt;/ref&gt; This phase of globalization was characterized by the rise of maritime European empires, in the 16th and 17th centuries, first the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish Empire]]s, and later the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] and [[British Empire]]s. In the 17th century, world trade developed further when [[Chartered company|chartered companies]] like the [[British East India Company]] (founded in 1600) and the [[Dutch East India Company]] (founded in 1602, often described as the first [[multinational corporation]] in which [[stock]] was offered) were established.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhuri, K.N. (1965\1999). ''The English East India Company: The Study of an Early Joint-stock Company 1600–1640 (Vol. 4).'' London: Routledge/Thoemmes Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early modern globalization is distinguished from modern globalization on the basis of [[expansionism]], the method of managing global trade, and the level of information exchange. The period is marked by such trade arrangements as the [[East India Company]], the shift of [[hegemony]] to Western Europe, the rise of larger-scale conflicts between powerful nations such as the [[Thirty Years' War]], and the rise of newfound commodities—most particularly [[slave trade]]. [[The Triangular Trade]] made it possible for Europe to take advantage of resources within the [[Western Hemisphere]]. The transfer of animal stocks, plant crops, and epidemic diseases associated with [[Alfred W. Crosby]]'s concept of the [[Columbian Exchange]] also played a central role in this process. European, [[Muslim]], Indian, [[Southeast Asia]]n, and Chinese merchants were all involved in early modern trade and communications, particularly in the Indian Ocean region.

===Modern===
According to economic historians Kevin H. O'Rourke, Leandro Prados de la Escosura, and Guillaume Daudin, several factors promoted globalization in the period 1815-1870:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cambridge-economic-history-of-modern-europe/trade-and-empire/BE789F27408634F4749D61F013897C04|title=Trade and empire (Chapter 4) - The Cambridge Economic History of Modern Europe|last=|first=|date=|website=Cambridge Core|pages=100–101|language=en|access-date=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars brought in an era of relative peace in Europe.
* Innovations in transportation technology reduced trade costs substantially.
* New industrial military technologies increased the power of European states and the United States, and allowed these powers to forcibly open up markets across the world and extend their empires.
* A gradual move towards greater liberalization in European countries.
During the 19th century, globalization approached its form as a direct result of the [[industrial revolution|Industrial Revolution]]. [[Industrialisation|Industrialization]] allowed [[standardization|standardized]] production of household items using [[economies of scale]] while rapid [[population growth]] created sustained [[demand]] for commodities. In the 19th century, steamships reduced the cost of international transport significantly and [[railroads]] made inland transportation cheaper. The transport revolution occurred some time between 1820 and 1850.&lt;ref name="When Did Globalization Begin" /&gt; More nations embraced [[international trade]].&lt;ref name="When Did Globalization Begin" /&gt; Globalization in this period was decisively shaped by nineteenth-century [[imperialism]] such as in [[Scramble for Africa|Africa]] and [[Western imperialism in Asia|Asia]]. The invention of [[shipping container]]s in 1956 helped advance the globalization of commerce.&lt;ref name="Levinson" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/business/how-the-invention-of-a-box-changed-our-world/2006/06/11/1149964409162.html%0A|title=How the invention of a box changed our world – Business – smh.com.au|last=Gittins|first=Ross|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=17 February 2013|date=12 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War II]], work by politicians led to the agreements of the [[Bretton Woods Conference]], in which major governments laid down the framework for [[International monetary systems|international monetary policy]], commerce, and finance, and the founding of several [[international institution]]s intended to facilitate economic growth by lowering [[trade barrier]]s. Initially, the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) led to a series of agreements to remove trade restrictions. GATT's successor was the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), which provided a framework for negotiating and formalizing trade agreements and a dispute resolution process. Exports nearly doubled from 8.5% of total gross world product in 1970 to 16.2% in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.globalpolicy.org/socecon/trade/tables/exports2.htm | title = World Exports as Percentage of Gross World Product | publisher=[[Global Policy Forum]] | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080712023541/http://www.globalpolicy.org/socecon/trade/tables/exports2.htm | archivedate = 12 July 2008 | accessdate =11 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approach of using global agreements to advance trade stumbled with the failure of the [[Doha Development Round]] of trade negotiation. Many countries then shifted to bilateral or smaller multilateral agreements, such as the 2011 [[South Korea–United States Free Trade Agreement]].

Since the 1970s, aviation has become increasingly affordable to [[middle class]]es in [[developed countries]]. [[Open skies]] policies and [[low-cost carrier]]s have helped to bring [[Competition (economics)|competition]] to the [[Market (economics)|market]]. In the 1990s, the growth of low-cost communication networks cut the cost of communicating between different countries. More work can be performed using a computer without regard to location. This included accounting, software development, and engineering design.

[[Student exchange program]]s became popular after [[World War II]], and are intended to increase the participants' understanding and tolerance of other cultures, as well as improving their language skills and broadening their social horizons. Between 1963 and 2006 the number of students studying in a foreign country increased 9 times.&lt;ref name=varghese/&gt;

In the late 19th and early 20th century, the connectedness of the world's economies and cultures grew very quickly. This slowed down from the 1910s onward due to the World Wars and the [[Cold War]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wolf|first=Martin|year=2001|title=Will the nation-state survive globalization?|journal=Foreign Affairs|volume=80|issue=1|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2001-01-01/will-nation-state-survive-globalization}}&lt;/ref&gt; but picked up again in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Ritzer, George (2011).  ''Globalization: The Essentials.''  NY: John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[revolutions of 1989]] and subsequent [[liberalization]] in many parts of the world resulted in a significant expansion of global interconnectedness. The migration and movement of people can also be highlighted as a prominent feature of the globalization process. In the period between 1965 and 1990, the proportion of the labor force migrating approximately doubled. Most migration occurred between the [[Developing country|developing countries]] and [[Least developed country|least developed countries]] (LDCs).&lt;ref name =Saggi2002&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Saggi | first1 = Kamal | year = 2002 | title = Trade, Foreign Direct Investment, and International Technology Transfer: A Survey | url = | journal = World Bank Research Observer | volume = 17 | issue = 2| pages = 191–235 | doi = 10.1093/wbro/17.2.191 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As economic integration intensified workers moved to areas with higher wages and most of the developing world oriented toward the international market economy.  The collapse of the Soviet Union not only ended the Cold War's division of the world- it also left the United States its sole policeman and an unfettered advocate of free market. It also resulted in the growing prominence of attention focused on the movement of diseases, the proliferation of popular culture and consumer values, the growing prominence of international institutions like the UN, and concerted international action on such issues as the environment and human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World Transformed 1945 to present|last=Hunt|first=Michael H.|publisher=|year=2004|isbn=|location=|page=399}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other developments as dramatic were the Internet has become influential in connecting people across the world. {{As of|2012|6}}, more than 2.4 billion people—over a third of the world's human population—have used the services of the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.treese.org/intindex/95-11.htm |title=The Open Market Internet Index |publisher=Treese.org |date=11 November 1995 |accessdate=15 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601045949/http://www.treese.org/intindex/95-11.htm |archivedate=1 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stats"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm|title=World Stats|date=30 June 2012|work=Internet World Stats|publisher=Miniwatts Marketing Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; Growth of globalization has never been smooth.

Economic globalization is the increasing economic interdependence of national economies across the world through a rapid increase in cross-[[border]] movement of goods, services, technology, and capital.&lt;ref name="Joshi, Rakesh Mohan 2009"&gt;Joshi, Rakesh Mohan, (2009) International Business, Oxford University Press, New Delhi and New York {{ISBN|0-19-568909-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the globalization of business is centered around the diminution of international trade regulations as well as [[tariff]]s, taxes, and other impediments that suppresses global trade, economic globalization is the process of increasing [[economic integration]] between countries, leading to the emergence of a global marketplace or a single world market.&lt;ref&gt;Riley, T: "Year 12 Economics", p. 9. Tim Riley Publications, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the paradigm, economic globalization can be viewed as either a positive or a negative phenomenon. Economic globalization comprises: Globalization of production; which refers to the obtention of goods and services from a particular source from different locations around the globe to benefit from difference in cost and quality. Likewise, it also comprises globalization of markets; which is defined as the union of different and separate markets into a massive global marketplace. Economic globalization also includes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/864808614|title=International business: competing in the global marketplace|last=Hill|first=Charles W.

Current globalization trends can be largely accounted for by developed economies integrating with less developed economies by means of [[foreign direct investment]], the reduction of trade barriers as well as other economic reforms, and, in many cases, [[immigration]].

[[International standard]]s have made trade in goods and services more efficient. An example of such standard is the [[intermodal container]]. [[Containerization]] dramatically reduced transport of its costs, supported the post-war boom in [[international trade]], and was a major element in globalization.&lt;ref name="Levinson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s9383.html|title=Sample Chapter for Levinson, M.: The Box: How the Shipping Container Made the World Smaller and the World Economy Bigger.|last=Levinson|first=Marc|work=[[The Box: How the Shipping Container Made the World Smaller and the World Economy Bigger]]|publisher=Princeton University Press|accessdate=17 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122131825/http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s9383.html|archivedate=22 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[International Organization for Standardization]] is an international standard-setting body composed of representatives from various national [[standards organizations]].

A [[free-trade area]] is the region encompassing a [[trade bloc]] whose member countries have signed a [[Free trade|free-trade]] agreement (FTA).

If people are also free to move between the countries, in addition to a free-trade agreement, it would also be considered an [[open border]].
Arguably the most significant free-trade area in the world is the [[European Union]], a [[Political union|politico]]-[[economic union]] of [[Member state of the European Union|{{EUnum}} member states]] that are primarily located in [[Europe]]. The EU has developed [[European Single Market]] through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states.

[[Trade facilitation]] looks at how procedures and controls governing the movement of goods across national borders can be improved to reduce associated cost burdens and maximise efficiency while safeguarding legitimate regulatory objectives.

Global trade in services is also significant. For example, in [[India]], [[business process outsourcing]] has been described as the "primary engine of the country's development over the next few decades, contributing broadly to [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] growth, employment growth, and poverty alleviation".&lt;ref name="Kuruvilla 2008 39–72"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuruvilla |first=Sarosh |last2=Ranganathan |first2=Aruna |title=Economic Development Strategies And Macro- And Micro-Level Human Resource Policies: The Case Of India's "Outsourcing" Industry|journal=Industrial &amp; Labor Relations Review|date=October 2008|volume=62|issue=1|pages=39–72|ref=harv |doi=10.1177/001979390806200103|url=http://ilr.sagepub.com/content/62/1/39.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/15777592?story_id=E1_TVSSSVJN|accessdate=16 April 2011|title=Outsourcing to Africa: The world economy calls &amp;#124; The Economist|date=16 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William I. Robinson]]'s theoretical approach to globalization is a critique of Wallerstein's World Systems Theory.  He believes that the global capital experienced today is due to a new and distinct form of globalization which began in the 1980s.  Robinson argues not only are economic activities expanded across national boundaries but also there is a transnational fragmentation of these activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robinson|first=William I.|title=Globalization and the sociology of Immanuel Wallerstein: A critical appraisal|journal=International Sociology|volume=1–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One important aspect of Robinson's globalization theory is that production of goods are increasingly global.  This means that one pair of shoes can be produced by six different countries, each contributing to a part of the production process.

{{Main|Cultural globalization}}

Cultural globalization refers to the transmission of ideas, meanings, and values around the world in such a way as to extend and intensify social relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=James|first=Paul|title=Globalism, Nationalism, Tribalism|year=2006|publisher=Sage Publications|location=London|url=https://www.academia.edu/1642214/Globalism_Nationalism_Tribalism_Bringing_Theory_Back_In_author_Sage_Publications_London_2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is marked by the common consumption of cultures that have been diffused by the Internet, [[popular culture]] media, and international travel. This has added to processes of commodity exchange and colonization which have a longer history of carrying cultural meaning around the globe. The circulation of cultures enables individuals to partake in extended social relations that cross national and regional borders. The creation and expansion of such social relations is not merely observed on a material level. Cultural globalization involves the formation of shared norms and knowledge with which people associate their individual and collective cultural identities. It brings increasing interconnectedness among different populations and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Manfred B. Steger and Paul James, ‘Ideologies of Globalism’, in Paul James and Manfred B.

[[Cross-cultural communication]] is a field of study that looks at how people from differing cultural backgrounds communicate, in similar and different ways among themselves, and how they endeavour to communicate across cultures. [[Intercultural communication]] is a related field of study.

[[Cultural diffusion]] is the spread of [[culture|cultural]] items—such as [[idea]]s, [[fashion|styles]], [[religion]]s, [[technology|technologies]], [[contact linguistics|languages]] etc.
Cultural globalization has increased cross-cultural contacts, but may be accompanied by a decrease in the uniqueness of once-isolated communities. For example, [[sushi]] is available in Germany as well as Japan, but [[Disneyland Paris|Euro-Disney]] outdraws the city of Paris, potentially reducing demand for "authentic" French pastry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/policy_report/v25n3/globalization.pdf |title=Globalization and Culture |last1=Cowen |first1=Tyler |last2=Barber |first2=Benjamin |journal=Cato Policy Report |date=May–June 2003 |accessdate=15 March 2017|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nadeem, S (2009) [http://nadeem.commons.gc.cuny.edu/files/2010/04/CS_Nadeem.pdf Macaulay's (Cyber) Children: The Cultural Politics of Outsourcing in India].

Religions were among the earliest cultural elements to globalize, being spread by force, migration, [[evangelism|evangelists]], imperialists, and traders.

The term globalization implies transformation. Cultural practices including traditional music can be lost or turned into a fusion of traditions. Globalization can trigger a state of emergency for the preservation of musical heritage. Archivists may attempt to collect, record, or transcribe repertoires before melodies are assimilated or modified, while local musicians may struggle for [[authenticity in art|authenticity]] and to preserve local musical traditions. Globalization can lead performers to discard traditional instruments. Fusion genres can become interesting fields of analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton, Thomas. 2004.

In: Comparative Education Review, vol. 48, no. 3, pp. 274–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

Music has an important role in economic and cultural development during globalization. Music genres such as [[jazz]] and [[reggae]] began locally and later became international phenomena. Globalization gave support to the [[world music]] phenomenon by allowing music from developing countries to reach broader audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Throsby, David. (2002.) "The music industry in the new millennium: Global and Local Perspectives."

[[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu]] claimed that the perception of consumption can be seen as self-identification and the formation of identity. Musically, this translates into each individual having their own musical identity based on likes and tastes. These likes and tastes are greatly influenced by culture, as this is the most basic cause for a person's wants and behavior. The concept of one's own culture is now in a period of change due to globalization. Also, globalization has increased the interdependency of political, personal, cultural, and economic factors.&lt;ref&gt;Beard, David and Keneth Gloag. 2005. Musicology: The Key Concepts. London and New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 [[UNESCO]] report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uis.unesco.org/template/pdf/cscl/IntlFlows_EN.pdf |title=International Flows of Selected Goods and Services |format=PDF |accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that cultural exchange is becoming more frequent from Eastern Asia, but that Western countries are still the main exporters of cultural goods. In 2002, China was the third largest exporter of cultural goods, after the UK and US. Between 1994 and 2002, both North America's and the [[European Union]]'s shares of cultural exports declined while Asia's cultural exports grew to surpass North America. Related factors are the fact that Asia's population and area are several times that of North America. Americanization is related to a period of high political American clout and of significant growth of America's shops, markets and objects being brought into other countries.

Some critics of globalization argue that it harms the diversity of cultures. As a dominating country's culture is introduced into a receiving country through globalization, it can become a threat to the diversity of local culture. Some argue that globalization may ultimately lead to [[Westernization]] or Americanization of culture, where the dominating cultural concepts of economically and politically powerful Western countries spread and cause harm to local cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://aleteia.org/2018/04/11/why-do-we-need-religion-in-a-globalized-world/|title=Why do we need religion in a globalized world?|date=11 April 2018|work=Aleteia — Catholic Spirituality, Lifestyle, World News, and Culture|access-date=12 April 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globalization is a diverse phenomenon which relates to a multilateral political world and to the increase of cultural objects and markets between countries. The Indian experience particularly reveals the [[Cultural pluralism|plurality]] of the impact of cultural globalization.&lt;ref&gt;Ghosh, Biswajit (2011).

==Political globalization==
{{Main|Political globalization}}
[[File:67º Período de Sesiones de la Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas (8020913157).jpg|thumb|The [[Headquarters of the United Nations|United Nations Headquarters]] in [[New York City]]]]

In general, globalization may ultimately reduce the importance of [[nation state]]s. [[Supranational]] institutions such as the [[European Union]], the [[WTO]], the [[G8]] or the [[International Criminal Court]] replace or extend national functions to facilitate international agreement.&lt;ref name="Scholte, 2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Scholte|first=Jan-Aart|title=Globalization: A Critical Introduction |chapter=Chapter 6: Globalization and Governance|year=2005|publisher=Palgrave}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could ultimately lead to a [[global union]], based on the [[European Union]] model.&lt;ref name="mcclintock1"&gt;John McClintock (2010). "The Uniting of Nations: An Essay on Global Governance (3rd ed. revised and updated)". Publisher: P.I.E. Peter Lang.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Intergovernmentalism]] is a term in [[political science]] with two meanings. The first refers to a theory of regional integration originally proposed by [[Stanley Hoffmann]]; the second treats states and the national government as the primary factors for integration.&lt;ref name="japss2009"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Contribution of the Neofunctionalist and Intergovernmentalist Theories to the Evolution of the European Integration Process|url=http://www.japss.org/upload/14._Mogaarticle.pdf|publisher=Journal of Alternative Perspectives in the Social Sciences|accessdate=21 May 2012|author=Teodor Lucian Moga|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Multi-level governance]] is an approach in [[political science]] and [[public administration theory]] that originated from studies on [[European integration]]. Multi-level governance gives expression to the idea that there are many interacting authority structures at work in the emergent global political economy.  It illuminates the intimate entanglement between the domestic and international levels of authority.

Some people are citizens of multiple nation-states. [[Multiple citizenship]], also called dual citizenship or multiple nationality or  dual nationality, is a person's [[citizenship]] status, in which a person is concurrently regarded as a citizen of more than one [[Sovereign state|state]] under the laws of those states.

Increasingly, [[non-governmental organization]]s influence public policy across national boundaries, including [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian aid]] and [[International development|developmental efforts]].&lt;ref name="globall"&gt;Pawel Zaleski ''Global Non-governmental Administrative System: Geosociology of the Third Sector'', [in:] Gawin, Dariusz &amp; Glinski, Piotr [ed.]: "Civil Society in the Making", IFiS Publishers, Warszawa 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Philanthropic organizations with global missions are also coming to the forefront of humanitarian efforts; charities such as the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]], [[Accion International]], the Acumen Fund (now [[Acumen Fund|Acumen]]) and the [[Echoing Green]] have combined the [[business model]] with [[philanthropy]], giving rise to business organizations such as the [[Global Philanthropy Group]] and new associations of philanthropists such as the [[Global Philanthropy Forum]].  The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation projects include a current multibillion-dollar commitment to funding immunizations in some of the world's more impoverished but rapidly growing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gatesfoundation.org/What-We-Do/Global-Development/Vaccine-Delivery|title=Vaccine Delivery|work=Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hudson Institute]] estimates total private philanthropic flows to developing countries at [[US$]]59 billion in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hudson.org/files/publications/2012IndexofGlobalPhilanthropyandRemittances.pdf ''The Index of Global Philanthropy and Remittances 2012''.

As a response to globalization, some countries have embraced [[isolationism|isolationist]] policies. For example, the [[North Korea]]n government makes it very difficult for foreigners to enter the country and strictly monitors their activities when they do. Aid workers are subject to considerable scrutiny and excluded from places and regions the government does not wish them to enter. Citizens cannot freely leave the country.&lt;ref name=nkr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northkoreanrefugees.com/2008-exodus.htm |title=North Korean Refugees NGO |publisher=Northkoreanrefugees.com |date=20 October 2008 |accessdate=23 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=unhcr&gt;{{cite web|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,,,PRK,4562d8cf2,487ca236c0,0.html |title=UNHCR Freedom in the World 2008 – North Korea |publisher=Unhcr.org |date=2 July 2008 |accessdate=23 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018022844/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country%2C%2C%2C%2CPRK%2C4562d8cf2%2C487ca236c0%2C0.html |archivedate=18 October 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other dimensions==
Scholars also occasionally discuss other, less common dimensions of globalization, such as [[environmental globalization]] (the internationally coordinated practices and regulations, often in the form of international treaties, regarding environmental protection)&lt;ref name="Zimmerer2006-1"&gt;{{cite book|first=Karl S. |last=Zimmerer|title=Globalization &amp; New Geographies of Conservation|url={{google books|id=UdLK-UGj7YkC|page=1|plainurl=yes}}|year=2006|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-98344-8|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[military globalization]] (growth in global extent and scope of security relationships).&lt;ref name="Krishnan2016"&gt;{{cite book|first=Armin |last=Krishnan|title=War as Business: Technological Change and Military Service Contracting|url={{google books|id=1ymrCwAAQBAJ|page=PA157|plainurl=yes}}|date=3 March 2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-00049-5|page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those dimensions, however, receive much less attention the three described above, as academic literature commonly subdivides globalization into three major areas: [[economic globalization]], [[cultural globalization]] and [[political globalization]].&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-146"/&gt;

===Movement of people===
[[File:World-airline-routemap-2009.png|thumb|Scheduled [[airline]] traffic in 2009]]
An essential aspect of globalization is movement of people, and state-boundary limits on that movement have changed across history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | year= 2014 | last1= James| first1= Paul | authorlink1= Paul James (academic) | title= Faces of Globalization and the Borders of States: From Asylum Seekers to Citizens | url= https://www.academia.edu/7773440/Faces_of_Globalization_and_the_Borders_of_States_From_Asylum_Seekers_to_Citizens | journal= Citizenship Studies | volume=  18 | issue=  2 | pages= 208–23.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement of tourists and business people opened up over the last century. As transportation technology improved, travel time and costs decreased dramatically between the 18th and early 20th century. For example, travel across the [[Atlantic ocean]] used to take up to 5 weeks in the 18th century, but around the time of the 20th century it took a mere 8 days.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Boustan, Adain May . "Fertility and Immigration." UCLA. 15 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, modern aviation has made long-distance transportation quick and affordable.

[[Tourism]] is travel for pleasure. The developments in technology and transport infrastructure, such as [[Wide-body aircraft|jumbo jets]], [[Low-cost carrier|low-cost airlines]], and more [[accessible tourism|accessible]] [[airport]]s have made many types of tourism more affordable. International tourist arrivals surpassed the milestone of 1 billion tourists globally for the first time in 2012.&lt;ref name="Barom2012"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://dtxtq4w60xqpw.cloudfront.net/sites/all/files/pdf/unwto_barom13_01_jan_excerpt_0.pdf |title=UNWTO World Tourism Barometer |publisher=[[World Tourism Organization]] |journal=UNWTO World Tourism Barometer |date=January 2013 |volume=11 |issue=1 |accessdate=9 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228162347/http://dtxtq4w60xqpw.cloudfront.net/sites/all/files/pdf/unwto_barom13_01_jan_excerpt_0.pdf |archivedate=28 February 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A [[Travel visa|visa]] is a conditional authorization granted by a country to a foreigner, allowing them to enter and temporarily remain within, or to leave that country. Some countries – such as those in the [[Schengen Area]] – have agreements with other countries allowing each other's citizens to travel between them without visas. The [[World Tourism Organization]] announced that the number of tourists who require a visa before traveling was at its lowest level ever in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/travel/visa-requirements-for-tourism-eased-around-the-world-says-un-agency-365446391.html Visa requirements for tourism eased around the world, says UN agency]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dtxtq4w60xqpw.cloudfront.net/sites/all/files/docpdf/2015visaopennessreportonline.pdf |title=Visa Openness Report 2015 January 2016 |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160123123959/http://dtxtq4w60xqpw.cloudfront.net/sites/all/files/docpdf/2015visaopennessreportonline.pdf |archivedate=23 January 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Immigration]] is the international movement of people into a destination [[country]] of which they are not natives or where they do not possess [[citizenship]] in order to settle or reside there, especially as [[Permanent residency|permanent residents]] or [[Naturalization|naturalized]] citizens, or to take-up [[employment]] as a [[migrant worker]] or temporarily as a [[foreign worker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/immigration|title=immigration|publisher=Oxford University Press|website=OxfordDictionaries.com|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/immigration| title=immigrate|publisher=Merriam-Webster, In.|website=Merriam-Webster.com|accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RCUK"&gt;{{cite web|title=Who's who: Definitions|url=http://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/policy_research/the_truth_about_asylum/the_facts_about_asylum|first=|last=|publisher=Refugee Council|location=London, England|year=2016|access-date= 7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the [[International Labour Organization]], {{as of|2014|lc=y}} there were an estimated 232 million international migrants in the world (defined as persons outside their country of origin for 12 months or more) and approximately half of them were estimated to be economically active (i.e. being employed or seeking employment).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mainstreaming of Migration in Development Policy and Integrating Migration in the Post-2015 UN Development Agenda|url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_protect/---protrav/---migrant/documents/genericdocument/wcms_220084.pdf|website=www.ilo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; International movement of labor is often seen as important to economic development. For example, [[freedom of movement for workers in the European Union]] means that people can move freely between member states to live, work, study or retire in another country.

''[[Financial Times]]''. 1 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Globalization is associated with a dramatic rise in [[international education]].  More and more students are seeking higher education in foreign countries and many [[international student]]s now consider overseas study a stepping-stone to permanent residency within a country.&lt;ref name="gribble"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gribble | first1 = C | year = 2008 | title = Policy options for managing international student migration: the sending country's perspective | url = | journal = Journal of Higher Education Policy and Management | volume = 30 | issue = 1| pages = 25–39 | doi=10.1080/13600800701457830}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The contributions that [[foreign student]]s make to host nation economies, both culturally and financially has encouraged major players to implement further initiatives to facilitate the arrival and integration of overseas students, including substantial amendments to [[immigration]] and visa policies and procedures.&lt;ref name="varghese"&gt;Varghese, N.V. 2008, 'Globalization of higher education and cross-border student mobility', International Institute for Educational Planning, UNESCO&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[transnational marriage]] is a [[marriage]] between two people from different countries. A variety of special issues arise in marriages between people from different countries, including those related to [[citizenship]] and culture, which add complexity and challenges to these kinds of relationships.
In an age of increasing globalization, where a growing number of people have ties to networks of people and places across the globe, rather than to a current geographic location, people are increasingly marrying across national boundaries. Transnational marriage is a by-product of the movement and migration of people.

===Movement of information===
{{See also|Internet}}
{{Internet users by region}}
Before electronic communications, long-distance communications relied on [[mail]]. Speed of global communications was limited by the maximum speed of courier services (especially horses and ships) until the mid-19th century. The [[electric telegraph]] was the first method of instant long-distance communication. For example, before the first transatlantic cable, communications between Europe and the Americas took weeks because ships had to carry mail across the ocean. The first [[transatlantic telegraph cable|transatlantic cable]] reduced communication time considerably, allowing a message and a response in the same day. Lasting transatlantic telegraph connections were achieved in the 1865–1866. The first wireless telegraphy transmitters were developed in 1895.

The [[Internet]] has been instrumental in connecting people across geographical boundaries. For example, [[Facebook]] is a [[social networking service]] which has more than [[List of virtual communities with more than 100 million active users|1.65 billion monthly active users]] {{as of|2016|3|31|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name="Facebook-Newsroom"&gt;{{cite web|title=Company Info – Facebook Newsroom|url=https://newsroom.fb.com/company-info/|publisher=Facebook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globalization can be spread by Global journalism which provides massive information and relies on the internet to interact,  "makes it into an everyday routine to investigate how people and their actions, practices, problems, life conditions etc. in different parts of the world are interrelated. possible to assume that global threats such as climate change precipitate the further establishment of global journalism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Peter |last=Berglez |date=2008 |title=WHAT IS GLOBAL JOURNALISM? |journal=Journalism Studies |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=845–858 &lt;!--was originally "5" but that's confusing--&gt; |doi=10.1080/14616700802337727}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==
{{See also|List of globalization-related indices}}

One index of globalization is the ''KOF Index of Globalization'', which measures three important dimensions of globalization:  economic, social, and political.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://globalization.kof.ethz.ch/ | title=KOF Index of Globalization | publisher=The KOF Swiss Economic Institute | work=ethz.ch | date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another is the [[A.T.

Measurements of economic globalization typically focus on variables such as [[trade]], [[Foreign Direct Investment]] (FDI), [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP), [[portfolio investment]], and [[income]].  However, newer indices attempt to measure globalization in more general terms, including variables related to political, social, cultural, and even environmental aspects of globalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vujakovic | first1 = Petra | year = 2010 | title = How to Measure Globalization?

==Support and criticism==
{{See also|Criticisms of globalization}}
Reactions to processes contributing to globalization have varied widely with a history as long as extraterritorial contact and trade. [[philosophy|Philosophical]] differences regarding the costs and benefits of such processes give rise to a broad-range of [[ideology|ideologies]] and [[social movements]].  Proponents of [[economic growth]], [[economic expansion|expansion]] and [[economic development|development]], in general, view globalizing processes as desirable or necessary to the well-being of human [[society]].&lt;ref name=Sen1970&gt;Sen, Amartya K. (1970).  ''Collective choice and social welfare.'' San Francisco, CA: Holden-Day.&lt;/ref&gt;

Antagonists view one or more globalizing processes as detrimental to social well-being on a global or local scale;&lt;ref name=Sen1970 /&gt; this includes those who social or [[natural environment|natural]] [[sustainability]] of long-term and continuous economic expansion, the social [[structural inequality]] caused by these processes, and the [[Colonialism|colonial]], [[Imperialism|imperialistic]], or [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] [[ethnocentrism]], [[cultural assimilation]] and [[cultural appropriation]] that underlie such processes.

Globalization tends to bring people into contact with foreign people and cultures. [[Xenophobia]] is the fear of that which is perceived to be foreign or strange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/xenophobia?q=xenophobia|title=Definition of xenophobia in English from the Oxford dictionary|work=oxforddictionaries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/xenophobia|title=Define Xenophobia at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Xenophobia can manifest itself in many ways involving the relations and [[perception]]s of an [[ingroup]] towards an [[Outgroup (sociology)|outgroup]], including a fear of losing identity, suspicion of its activities, aggression, and desire to eliminate its presence to secure a presumed purity.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Guido Bolaffi. ''Dictionary of race, ethnicity and culture''. SAGE Publications Ltd., 2003. p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critiques of globalization generally stem from discussions surrounding the impact of such processes on the planet as well as the human costs. They challenge directly traditional metrics, such as GDP, and look to other measures, such as the [[Gini coefficient]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTPOVERTY/EXTPA/0,,contentMDK:20238991~menuPK:492138~pagePK:148956~piPK:216618~theSitePK:430367,00.html|title=Poverty Analysis – Measuring Inequality|work=worldbank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Happy Planet Index]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.happyplanetindex.org/ |title=The Happy Planet Index |publisher=Neweconomics.org |accessdate=2 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and point to a "multitude of interconnected fatal consequences–social disintegration, a breakdown of democracy, more rapid and extensive deterioration of the environment, the spread of new diseases, increasing poverty and alienation"&lt;ref name="The Hidden Connections"&gt;{{cite book | last = Capra | first = Fritjof | year = 2002 | title = The Hidden Connections | publisher=Random House | location = New York, New York | isbn = 0-385-49471-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; which they claim are the [[unintended consequences]] of globalization. Others point out that, while the forces of globalization have led to the spread of western-style democracy, this has been accompanied by an increase in inter-ethnic tension and violence as free market economic policies combine with democratic processes of universal suffrage as well as an escalation in militarization to impose democratic principles and as a means to conflict resolution.&lt;ref&gt;Sorrells, Kathryn. Intercultural Communication: Globalization and Social Justice. Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE, 2013. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public opinion on globalization===

A 2005 study by Peer Fiss and Paul Hirsch found a large increase in articles negative towards globalization in the years prior. In 1998, negative articles outpaced positive articles by two to one.&lt;ref name="Fiss 2005"&gt;Fiss, Peer and Hirsch, Pal: "The Discourse of Globalization: Framing and Sensemaking of an Emerging Concept. American Sociological Review, February 2005. vol. 70 no 1: 29–52.&lt;/ref&gt; The number of newspaper articles showing negative framing rose from about 10% of the total in 1991 to 55% of the total in 1999. This increase occurred during a period when the total number of articles concerning globalization nearly doubled.&lt;ref name="Fiss 2005"/&gt;

A number of international polls have shown that residents of Africa and Asia tend to view globalization more favorably than residents of Europe or North America. In Africa, a Gallup poll found that 70% of the population views globalization favorably.&lt;ref&gt;"Africans and Asians Tend to View Globalization Favorably. Europeans and Americans are More Skeptical". World Public Opinion.org. 7 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC found that 50% of people believed that economic globalization was proceeding too rapidly, while 35% believed it was proceeding too slowly.&lt;ref name=bbc08&gt;{{cite web| title = Widespread Unease about Economy and Globalization – Global poll| author = BBC World Service| date = 2008| accessdate = 24 March 2015| url = http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/pdf/feb08/BBCEcon_Feb08_rpt.pdf| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140903173226/http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/pdf/feb08/BBCEcon_Feb08_rpt.pdf| archivedate = 3 September 2014| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Philip Gordon stated that "a clear majority of Europeans believe that globalization can enrich their lives, while believing the European Union can help them take advantage of globalization's benefits while shielding them from its negative effects." The main opposition consisted of socialists, environmental groups, and nationalists. Residents of the EU did not appear to feel threatened by globalization in 2004. The EU job market was more stable and workers were less likely to accept wage/benefit cuts. Social spending was much higher than in the US.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Philip. 2004. [http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/globalization-europes-wary-embrace "Globalization: Europe's Wary Embrace"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629191739/http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/globalization-europes-wary-embrace|date=29 June 2011}}. Yale Global, 1 November 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In a Danish poll in 2007, 76% responded that globalization is a good thing.&lt;ref&gt;Time Magazine: [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1684528,00.html Why Denmark Loves Globalisation]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fiss, ''et al.'', surveyed US opinion in 1993. Their survey showed that, in 1993, more than 40% of respondents were unfamiliar with the concept of globalization. When the survey was repeated in 1998, 89% of the respondents had a polarized view of globalization as being either good or bad. At the same time, discourse on globalization, which began in the financial community before shifting to a heated debate between proponents and disenchanted students and workers. Polarization increased dramatically after the establishment of the WTO in 1995; this event and subsequent protests led to a large-scale anti-globalization movement.&lt;ref name="Fiss 2005"/&gt;
Initially, college educated workers were likely to support globalization. Less educated workers, who were more likely to compete with immigrants and workers in developing countries, tended to be opponents. The situation changed after the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010|financial crisis of 2007]]. According to a 1997 poll 58% of college graduates said globalization had been good for the US. By 2008 only 33% thought it was good. Respondents with high school education also became more opposed.&lt;ref name="ip08"&gt;Greg Ip: "The Declining Value Of Your College Degree", ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''. 17 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Takenaka Heizo and Chida Ryokichi, {{as of|1998|lc=y}} there was a perception in Japan that the economy was "Small and Frail". However, Japan was resource-poor and used exports to pay for its raw materials. Anxiety over their position caused terms such as ''[[internationalization]]'' and ''globalization'' to enter everyday language. However, Japanese tradition was to be as self-sufficient as possible, particularly in agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Takenaka Heizo and Chida Ryokichi. 1998. "Japan," ''Domestic Adjustments to Globalization''; (ed, Charles E. Morrison and Hadi Soesastro), Tokyo: Japan center for International Exchange, 1998, pp. 76–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many in developing countries see globalization as a positive force that lifts them out of poverty.&lt;ref name="bhagwati"/&gt; Those opposing globalization typically combine environmental concerns with nationalism. Opponents consider governments as agents of [[neo-colonialism]] that are subservient to [[multinational corporations]].&lt;ref name="visuality.org"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shoa |first=S.

In the book ''[[The End of Poverty]]'', Jeffrey Sachs discusses how many factors can affect a country's ability to enter the world market, including government [[Political corruption|corruption]]; legal and social disparities based on gender, ethnicity, or caste; diseases such as [[AIDS]] and [[malaria]]; lack of infrastructure (including transportation, communications, health, and trade); unstable political landscapes; [[protectionism]]; and geographic barriers.&lt;ref name="The End of Poverty"&gt;{{cite book | last = Sachs | first = Jeffrey | year = 2005 | title = The End of Poverty | publisher=The Penguin Press | location = New York, New York | isbn = 1-59420-045-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Jagdish Bhagwati]], a former adviser to the U.N. on globalization, holds that, although there are obvious problems with overly rapid development, globalization is a very positive force that lifts countries out of poverty by causing a virtuous economic cycle associated with faster economic growth.&lt;ref name="bhagwati"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bhagwati | first = Jagdish | title = In Defense of Globalization | publisher=Oxford University Press | year = 2004 | location = Oxford, New York | url =| isbn =978-0195330939}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, economic growth does not necessarily mean a reduction in poverty; in fact, the two can coexist.

The flow of migrants to advanced economic countries has been claimed to provide a means through which global wages converge. An IMF study noted a potential for skills to be transferred back to developing countries as wages in those a countries rise.&lt;ref name="12th April 2000: IMF Publications"/&gt; Lastly, the dissemination of knowledge has been an integral aspect of globalization. Technological innovations (or technological transfer) is conjectured to benefit most the developing and least developing countries (LDCs), as for example in the adoption of [[mobile phones]].&lt;ref name="Saggi2002" /&gt;

There has been a rapid economic growth in Asia after embracing [[market orientation]]-based economic policies that encourage private [[property rights]], free enterprise and competition. In particular, in East Asian developing countries, [[GDP]] per head rose at 5.9% a year from 1975 to 2001 (according to 2003 [[Human Development Report]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2003|url= http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/hdr03_complete.pdf|title=Human Development Report 2003|publisher=UNDP|accessdate=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; of UNDP). Like this, the British economic journalist [[Martin Wolf]] says that incomes of poor developing countries, with more than half the world's population, grew substantially faster than those of the world's richest countries that remained relatively stable in its growth, leading to reduced international inequality and the incidence of poverty.

Certain demographic changes in the developing world after active [[economic liberalization]] and international integration resulted in rising general welfare and, hence, reduced inequality. According to Wolf, in the developing world as a whole, life expectancy rose by four months each year after 1970 and infant mortality rate declined from 107 per thousand in 1970 to 58 in 2000 due to improvements in [[standards of living]] and health conditions. Also, adult literacy in developing countries rose from 53% in 1970 to 74% in 1998 and much lower illiteracy rate among the young guarantees that rates will continue to fall as time passes. Furthermore, the reduction in [[fertility rate]] in the developing world as a whole from 4.1 births per woman in 1980 to 2.8 in 2000 indicates improved education level of women on fertility, and control of fewer children with more parental attention and investment.&lt;ref name="Wolf2004"&gt;{{cite book|url= http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300107777|title= Why Globalization Works|publisher= [[Yale University Press]]|author= Martin Wolf|year= 2004|isbn= 978-0300102529|accessdate= 6 April 2013|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130510120230/http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300107777|archivedate= 10 May 2013|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, more prosperous and educated parents with fewer children have chosen to withdraw their children from the labor force to give them opportunities to be educated at school improving the issue of [[child labor]]. Thus, despite seemingly unequal [[distribution of income]] within these developing countries, their economic growth and development have brought about improved standards of living and welfare for the population as a whole.

Per capita [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) growth among post-1980 globalizing countries accelerated from 1.4 percent a year in the 1960s and 2.9 percent a year in the 1970s to 3.5 percent in the 1980s and 5.0 percent in the 1990s. This acceleration in growth seems even more remarkable given that the rich countries saw steady declines in growth from a high of 4.7 percent in the 1960s to 2.2 percent in the 1990s. Also, the non-globalizing developing countries seem to fare worse than the globalizers, with the former's annual growth rates falling from highs of 3.3 percent during the 1970s to only 1.4 percent during the 1990s. This rapid growth among the globalizers is not simply due to the strong performances of China and India in the 1980s and 1990s—18 out of the 24 globalizers experienced increases in growth, many of them quite substantial.&lt;ref name="DDollar"&gt;{{cite web|author=Dollar, David|author2=Kraay, Aart|title=Trade, Growth, and Poverty|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2001/09/dollar.htm|work=Finance and Development|publisher=International Monetary Fund|accessdate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The globalization of the late 20th and early 21st centuries has led to the resurfacing of the idea that the growth of economic [[interdependence]] promotes peace.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. {{cite web |title=Globalisation promotes peace

Globalization allows corporations to [[outsource]] manufacturing and service jobs from high cost locations, creating economic opportunities with the most competitive wages and worker benefits.&lt;ref name="Kuruvilla 2008 39–72"/&gt; Critics of globalization say that it disadvantages poorer countries. While it is true that free trade encourages globalization among countries, some countries try to protect their domestic suppliers. The main export of poorer countries is usually [[agricultural production]]s. Larger countries often subsidize their [[Agricultural subsidy|farmers]] (e.g., the EU's [[Common Agricultural Policy]]), which lowers the market price for foreign crops.&lt;ref name="Hurst E.

===Global democracy===
{{Main|Democratic globalization}}

'''Democratic globalization''' is a movement towards an institutional system of global [[democracy]] that would give world citizens a say in political organizations. This would, in their view, bypass nation-states, corporate oligopolies, ideological [[Non-governmental organization]]s (NGO), political cults and mafias.  One of its most prolific proponents is the British political thinker [[David Held]]. Advocates of [[democratic globalization]] argue that economic expansion and development should be the first phase of democratic globalization, which is to be followed by a phase of building [[International political economy|global political institutions]]. Dr. [[Francesco Stipo]], Director of the United States Association of the [[Club of Rome]], advocates unifying nations under a [[world government]], suggesting that it "should reflect the political and economic balances of world nations. A world confederation would not supersede the authority of the State governments but rather complement it, as both the States and the world authority would have power within their sphere of competence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usacor.org/archive/index.html |title=USACOR.org |publisher=USACOR.org |date=28 July 2009 |accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[Senate of Canada|Canadian Senator]] [[Douglas Roche]], [[Order of Canada|O.C.]], viewed globalization as inevitable and advocated creating institutions such as a [[direct election|directly elected]] [[United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]] to exercise oversight over unelected international bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roche|first=Douglas|title=The Case for a United Nations  Parliamentary Assembly|url=http://www.wfm-igp.org/site/files/Roche_UN_Parliamentary_Assembly_2002.pdf|publisher=The World Federalist Movement–Institute for Global Policy|accessdate=28 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531054746/http://www.wfm-igp.org/site/files/Roche_UN_Parliamentary_Assembly_2002.pdf|archivedate=31 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global civics===
{{Main|Global civics|Multiculturalism}}
{{See also|Global citizenship}}

Global civics suggests that [[civics]] can be understood, in a global sense, as a [[social contract]] between [[Global citizenship|global citizens]] in the age of interdependence and interaction. The disseminators of the concept define it as the notion that we have certain rights and responsibilities towards each other by the mere fact of being human on Earth.&lt;ref name=case&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Altinay |first=Hakan |title=The Case for Global Civics |journal=Global Economy and Development at Brookings |year=2010 |url=http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2010/03_global_civics_altinay.aspx |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603104201/http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2010/03_global_civics_altinay.aspx |archivedate=3 June 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[World citizen]] has a variety of similar meanings, often referring to a person who disapproves of traditional [[geopolitical]] divisions derived from national [[citizenship]]. An early incarnation of this sentiment can be found in [[Socrates]], whom [[Plutarch]] quoted as saying: "I am not an Athenian, or a Greek, but a citizen of the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcitizens.org.au|title=World Citizens Association Australia|work=World Citizens Association Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an increasingly interdependent world, world citizens need a compass to frame their mindsets and create a shared consciousness and sense of global responsibility in world issues such as environmental problems and [[nuclear proliferation]].&lt;ref name = feasible&gt;{{cite journal | last = Altinay| first = Hakan| title= A Global Civics: Necessary?

Baha'i-inspired author Meyjes, while favoring the single world community and emergent global consciousness, warns of globalization&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| chapter = Language and Universalization: a ‘Linguistic Ecology’ Reading of Bahá’í Writ | first = Gregory Paul | last = Meyjes (also: Posthumus Meyjes) | title = The Journal of Bahá’í Studies | publisher = Association for Bahá’í Studies | series = | volume =Volume IX (1) | year =1999 | location = Ottawa | pages = 51–63 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a cloak for an expeditious economic, social, and cultural Anglo-dominance that is insufficiently inclusive to inform the emergence of an optimal world civilization. He proposes a process of "[[Universalism#Non-religious Universalism|universalization]]" as an alternative.

[[Cosmopolitanism]] is the proposal that all human ethnic groups belong to a single [[community]] based on a shared [[morality]]. A person who adheres to the idea of cosmopolitanism in any of its forms is called a cosmopolitan or cosmopolite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cosmopolitan|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cosmopolitan?s=t|work=Dictionary.com|accessdate=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cosmopolitan community might be based on an inclusive morality, a shared economic relationship, or a political structure that encompasses different nations. The cosmopolitan community is one in which individuals from different places (e.g. nation-states) form relationships based on mutual respect. For instance, [[Kwame Anthony Appiah]] suggests the possibility of a cosmopolitan community in which individuals from varying locations (physical, economic, etc.) enter relationships of mutual respect despite their differing beliefs (religious, political, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Kwame Anthony Appiah, "Cosmopolitan Patriots," Critical Inquiry 23, no. 3 (Spring, 1997): 617–639.&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian philosopher [[Marshall McLuhan]] popularized the term ''[[Global village (term)|Global Village]]'' beginning in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall McLuhan and Bruce R. Powers (17 September 1992) The Global Village: Transformations in World Life and Media in the 21st century .

===International cooperation===
'''Military cooperation'''&amp;nbsp;– Past examples of international cooperation exist. One example is the security cooperation between the United States and the former Soviet Union after the end of the Cold War, which astonished international society. Arms control and disarmament agreements, including the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (see [[START I]], [[START II]], [[START III]], and [[New START]]) and the establishment of [[NATO]]'s Partnership for Peace, the Russia NATO Council, and the [[G8]] Global Partnership against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction, constitute concrete initiatives of arms control and de-nuclearization. The US–Russian cooperation was further strengthened by anti-terrorism agreements enacted in the wake of 9/11.&lt;ref name="globalpolicyjournal1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicyjournal.com/brookings-audit/international-cooperation-stepping-stone-world-government |title=International cooperation as a stepping-stone to a world government &amp;#124; Global Policy Journal – Practitioner, Academic, Global Governance, International Law, Economics, Security, Institutions, Comment &amp; Opinion, Media, Events, Journal |publisher=Global Policy Journal |accessdate=15 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Environmental cooperation'''&amp;nbsp;– One of the biggest successes of environmental cooperation has been the agreement to reduce chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) emissions, as specified in the [[Montreal Protocol]], in order to stop ozone depletion. The most recent debate around nuclear energy and the non-alternative coal-burning power plants constitutes one more consensus on what not to do. Thirdly, significant achievements in IC can be observed through development studies.&lt;ref name="globalpolicyjournal1"/&gt;

(2011). Social movements (Rev. ed.). New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  The diverse subgroups that make up this movement include some of the following: trade unionists, environmentalists, anarchists, land rights and indigenous rights activists, organizations promoting human rights and sustainable development, opponents of privatization, and [[anti-sweatshop movement|anti-sweatshop]] campaigners.&lt;ref name="stwr.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stwr.org/the-un-people-politics/the-anti-globalization-movement-defined.htm|title=The Anti-Globalization Movement Defined Share The World's Resources|last=Engler|first=M.|date=30 May 2007|accessdate=14 March 2013}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}l&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Revolt of the Elites and the Betrayal of Democracy'', [[Christopher Lasch]] analyzes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/the-treachery-of-the-lites-elite-sense-of-irresponsibility-1610879.html |title=The treachery of the lites Elite sense of irresponsibility |publisher=The Independent |date=1995-03-10 |accessdate=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; the widening gap between the top and bottom of the social composition in the United States. For him, our epoch is determined by a social phenomenon: the revolt of the elites, in reference to ''The revolt of the masses'' (1929) of the Spanish philosopher José Ortega y Gasset. According to Lasch, the new elites, i.e. those who are in the top 20% in terms of income, through globalization which allows total mobility of capital, no longer live in the same world as their fellow-citizens. In this, they oppose the old bourgeoisie of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, which was constrained by its spatial stability to a minimum of rooting and civic obligations.
Globalization, according to the sociologist, has turned elites into tourists in their own countries. The de-nationalisation of business enterprise tends to produce a class who see themselves as "world citizens, but without accepting ... any of the obligations that citizenship in a polity normally implies". Their ties to an international culture of work, leisure, information – make many of them deeply indifferent to the prospect of  national decline. Instead of financing public services and the public treasury, new elites are investing their money in improving their voluntary ghettos: private schools in their residential neighborhoods, private police, garbage collection systems. They have "withdrawn from common life".
Composed of those who control the international flows of capital and information, who preside over philanthropic foundations and institutions of higher education, manage the instruments of cultural production and thus fix the terms of public debate. So, the political debate is limited mainly to the dominant classes and political ideologies lose all contact with the concerns of the ordinary citizen. The result of this is that no one has a likely solution to these problems and that there are furious ideological battles on related issues. 
However, they remain protected from the problems affecting the working classes: the decline of industrial activity, the resulting loss of employment, the decline of the middle class, increasing the number of the poor, the rising crime rate, growing drug trafficking, the urban crisis.

D.A. Snow et al. contend that the [[anti-globalization movement]] is an example of a [[new social movement]], which uses tactics that are unique and use different resources than previously used before in other social movements.&lt;ref&gt;Snow, D. A., Soule, S. A., &amp; Kriesi, H. (2004). The Blackwell companion to social movements. Malden, MA: Blackwell Pub..&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most infamous tactics of the movement is the [[Battle of Seattle (1999)|Battle of Seattle]] in 1999, where there were protests against the World Trade Organization's Third Ministerial Meeting. All over the world, the movement has held protests outside meetings of institutions such as the WTO, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, the World Economic Forum, and the Group of Eight (G8).&lt;ref name="stwr.org"/&gt; Within the Seattle demonstrations the protesters that participated used both creative and violent tactics to gain the attention towards the issue of globalization.

===Opposition to capital market integration===
{{Main|Anti-capitalist movements}}
[[File:Worldbank protest jakarta.jpg|thumb|World Bank Protester, [[Jakarta]], Indonesia]]

Capital markets have to do with raising and investing money in various human enterprises.  Increasing integration of these [[financial market]]s between countries leads to the emergence of a global capital marketplace or a single world market. In the long run, increased movement of capital between countries tends to favor owners of capital more than any other group; in the short run, owners and workers in specific sectors in capital-exporting countries bear much of the burden of adjusting to increased movement of capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Invested Interests: The Politics of National Economic Policies in a World of  Global Finance|last=Frieden|first=Jeffry A.|journal=[[International Organization]]|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|issn=1531-5088|volume=45|issue=4|year=1991|pages=425–51|doi=10.1017/s0020818300033178|jstor=2706944|registration=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those opposed to capital market integration on the basis of [[human rights]] issues  are especially disturbed by the various abuses which they think are perpetuated by global and international institutions that, they say, promote [[neoliberalism]] without regard to ethical standards. Common targets include the [[World Bank]] (WB), [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) and the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) and [[free trade]] treaties like the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]] (FTAA), the [[Multilateral Agreement on Investment]] (MAI) and the [[General Agreement on Trade in Services]] (GATS). In light of the economic gap between rich and poor countries, movement adherents claim free trade without measures in place to protect the under-capitalized will contribute only to the strengthening the power of industrialized nations (often termed the "North" in opposition to the developing world's "South").{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===Anti-corporatism and anti-consumerism===
{{Main|Anti-corporatism|Anti-consumerism}}

[[Corporatism|Corporatist]] ideology, which privileges the rights of corporations ([[Legal personality|artificial or juridical persons]]) over those of [[natural person]]s, is an underlying factor in the recent rapid expansion of global commerce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://carnegieendowment.org/2001/09/01/corporatism-goes-global | title=Corporatism Goes Global | author=Ottaway, Marina | journal=Global Governance: A Review of Multilateralism and International Organizations | volume=7 | issue=3 | date=September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, there have been an increasing number of books ([[Naomi Klein]]'s 2000 ''[[No Logo]]'', for example) and films (''e.g. [[The Corporation (2003 film)|The Corporation]]'' &amp; ''[[Surplus (film)|Surplus]]'') popularizing an [[Anti-corporate activism|anti-corporate]] [[ideology]] to the public.

A related contemporary ideology, [[consumerism]], which encourages the personal acquisition of goods and services, also drives globalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Lived effects of the Contemporary Economy: Globalization, Inequality, and Consumer Society. | author=Storper Michael | journal=Public Culture | year=2000 | volume=12 | issue=2 | pages=375–409 | doi=10.1215/08992363-12-2-375}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Anti-consumerism is a social movement against equating personal happiness with consumption and the purchase of material possessions. Concern over the treatment of consumers by large corporations has spawned substantial activism, and the incorporation of [[consumer education]] into school [[curriculum|curricula]]. Social activists hold materialism is connected to [[Big-box store|global retail merchandizing]] and [[supplier convergence]], [[war]], greed, [[anomie]], [[crime]], environmental degradation, and general social [[malaise]] and discontent. One variation on this topic is activism by ''postconsumers'', with the strategic emphasis on moving ''beyond'' addictive consumerism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Collective dissonance and the transition to post-consumerism | author=Cohen,  Maurie J. | journal=Futures |date=July 2013  | volume=52 | pages=42–51 | doi=10.1016/j.futures.2013.07.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The global justice movement is the loose collection of individuals and groups—often referred to as a "[[movement of movements]]"—who advocate [[fair trade]] rules and perceive current institutions of global economic integration as problems.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Mertes, "A Movement of Movements", New York: Verso, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  The movement is often labeled an anti-globalization movement by the mainstream media. Those involved, however, frequently deny that they are [[anti-globalization]], insisting that they support the globalization of communication and people and oppose only the global expansion of corporate power.&lt;ref&gt;della Porta, D. 2005. "The Social Bases of the Global Justice Movement: Some Theoretical Reflections and Empirical Evidence from the First European Social Forum." Civil Society and Social Movements Programme Paper No. 21.Geneva: UNRISD (United Nations Research Institute for Social Development).&lt;/ref&gt; The movement is based in the idea of [[social justice]], desiring the creation of a society or institution based on the principles of [[social equality|equality]] and [[solidarity]], the values of human rights, and the dignity of every human being.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"&gt;Education and Social Justice By J.

Many nongovernmental organizations have now arisen to fight these inequalities that many in Latin America, Africa and Asia face. A few very popular and well known [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs) include: [[War Child (charity)|War Child]], [[Red Cross]], [[Free The Children]] and [[CARE International]]. They often create partnerships where they work towards improving the lives of those who live in developing countries by building schools, fixing infrastructure, cleaning water supplies, purchasing equipment and supplies for hospitals, and other aid efforts.

====Social inequality====
{{Main|Social inequality|International inequality}}

The economies of the world have [[Development theory|developed]] unevenly, historically, such that entire geographical regions were left mired in poverty and disease while others began to reduce poverty and disease on a wholesale basis. From around 1980 through at least 2011, the GDP gap, while still wide, appeared to be closing and, in some more rapidly [[developing countries]], [[life expectancies]] began to rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-24835822 | title=How much do you know about the world? | publisher=BBC | date=2013 | accessdate=9 July 2014 | author=Rosling, Hans| work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; If we look at the Gini coefficient for world income, since the late 1980s, the gap between some regions has markedly narrowed—between Asia and the advanced economies of the West, for example—but huge gaps remain globally.  Overall equality across humanity, considered as individuals, has improved very little. Within the decade between 2003 and 2013, income inequality grew even in traditionally egalitarian countries like Germany, Sweden and Denmark. With a few exceptions—France, Japan, Spain—the top 10 percent of earners in most advanced economies raced ahead, while the bottom 10 percent fell further behind.&lt;ref name="Stiglitz"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/inequality-is-a-choice/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs | title=Inequality is a Choice | date=13 October 2013 | accessdate=9 July 2014 | author=Stiglits Joseph E. | location=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2013, a tiny elite of multibillionaires, 85 to be exact, had amassed wealth equivalent to all the wealth owned by the poorest half (3.5 billion) of the world's total population of 7 billion.&lt;ref name="WEF2014"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GAC_GlobalAgendaOutlook_2014.pdf | title=Outlook on the Global Agenda 2014 | publisher=World Economic Forum | accessdate=9 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of globalization argue that globalization results in weak [[trade union|labor unions]]: the surplus in cheap labor coupled with an ever-growing number of companies in transition weakened labor unions in high-cost areas. Unions become less effective and workers their enthusiasm for unions when membership begins to decline.&lt;ref name="Hurst E. Charles P.41"/&gt; They also cite an increase in the exploitation of [[child labour|child labor]]: countries with weak protections for children are vulnerable to infestation by rogue companies and criminal gangs who exploit them. Examples include [[quarry]]ing, salvage, and farm work as well as trafficking, bondage, forced labor, prostitution and pornography.&lt;ref name="Edmonds_Pavcni"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pavcnik | first = Nina |date=September 2005 | title = Child Labor in the Global Economy | journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 199–220 | doi = 10.1257/0895330053147895 | last2 = Pavcnik | first2 = Nina | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women often participate in the workforce in [[precarious work]], including [[export-oriented employment]].  Evidence suggests that while globalization has expanded women's access to employment, the long-term goal of transforming [[Gender inequality|gender inequalities]] remains unmet and appears unattainable without regulation of capital and a reorientation and expansion of the state's role in funding public goods and providing a social safety net.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Seguino|first1=Stephanie|last2=Grown|first2=Caren|date=November 2006|title=Gender equity and globalization: macroeconomic policy for developing countries|journal=Journal of International Development|volume=18|issue=8|pages=1081–104|doi=10.1002/jid.1295|ref=harv|author-link1=Stephanie Seguino|citeseerx=10.1.1.589.4614}} [http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTGENDER/Resources/Seguino_GrownGenderEquityandGlobalizationJID.pdf Pdf version – via the World Bank.]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the intersectionality of gender, race, class, and more remain overlooked when assessing the impact of globalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender, development, and globalization : economics as if all people mattered|last=Lourdes|first=Benería|others=Berik, Günseli,, Floro, Maria|isbn=9780415537483|edition= Second|location=New York|oclc=903247621}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, a study published by the IMF posited that [[neoliberalism]], the ideological backbone of contemporary globalized capitalism, has been "oversold", with the benefits of neoliberal policies being "fairly difficult to establish when looking at a broad group of countries" and the costs, most significantly higher income inequality within nations, "hurt the level and sustainability of growth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Foroohar |first=Rana |date=June 3, 2016 |title=Globalization's True Believers Are Having Second Thoughts|url=http://time.com/4356816/neoliberalism-imf-globalization/|work=TIME|location= |access-date=July 12, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-global governance===
{{Main|Global governance}}

Beginning in the 1930s, opposition arose to the idea of a world government, as advocated by organizations such as the [[World Federalist Movement]] (WFM). Those who oppose global governance typically do so on objections that the idea is unfeasible, inevitably oppressive, or simply unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Paul. (2006.) ''The Parliament of Man: The Past, Present, and Future of the United Nations.'' New York: Harper Collins. {{ISBN|978-0375501654}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, these opponents are wary of the concentration of power or wealth that such governance might represent. Such reasoning dates back to the founding of the [[League of Nations]] and, later, the [[United Nations]].

===Environmentalist opposition===
[[File:Madagascar highland plateau.jpg|thumb|[[Deforestation]] of the [[Madagascar]] Highland Plateau has led to extensive [[siltation]] and unstable flows of western [[river]]s.]]
{{Main|Environmentalism}}
{{See also|Global warming|Climate change|Deforestation}}

[[Environmentalism]] is a broad philosophy, ideology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/progress/ideology.html |title=Ideology and Sustainability |publisher=Formal.stanford.edu |accessdate=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ronald Bailey from the February 2002 issue |url=http://reason.com/archives/2002/02/01/debunking-green-myths |title=Debunking Green Myths |publisher=Reason.com |accessdate=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald Gibson. Environmentalism: Ideology and Power. Nova Science Pub Inc. 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and social movement regarding concerns for environmental [[Conservation movement|conservation]] and improvement of the health of the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. Environmentalist concerns with globalization include issues such as [[global warming]], [[climate change]], global [[water supply]] and [[Water crisis|water crises]], inequity in [[energy consumption]] and [[energy conservation]], transnational [[air pollution]] and pollution of the [[world ocean]], [[overpopulation]], world [[habitat]] [[sustainability]], [[deforestation]], [[biodiversity]] and [[species extinction]].

One critique of globalization is that natural resources of the poor have been systematically taken over by the rich and the pollution promulgated by the rich is systematically dumped on the poor.&lt;ref&gt;Low, Nicholas. (2002). ''Global Ethics and Environment''. Routledge Science. {{ISBN|978-0415197359}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that Northern corporations are increasingly exploiting resources of less wealthy countries for their global activities while it is the South that is disproportionately bearing the environmental burden of the globalized economy. Globalization is thus leading to a type of" environmental [[apartheid]]".&lt;ref&gt;Lechner, Frank J., and John Boli. 2012. ''The Globalization Reader'', 4th ed. Wiley-Blackwell. {{ISBN|978-0470655634}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Helena Norberg-Hodge]], the director and founder of Local Futures/[[International Society for Ecology and Culture]], criticizes globalization in many ways. In her book ''[[Ancient Futures: Learning from Ladakh|Ancient Futures]]'', Norberg-Hodge claims that "centuries of ecological balance and social harmony are under threat from the pressures of development and globalization." She also criticizes the standardization and rationalization of globalization, as it does not always yield the expected growth outcomes. Although globalization takes similar steps in most countries, scholars such as Hodge claim that it might not be effective to certain countries and that globalization has actually moved some countries backward instead of developing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Norberg-Hodge|first=Helena|title=Ancient futures : learning from Ladakh|year=1992|publisher=Sierra Club Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0871566435|edition= Sierra Club Books paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related area of concern is the [[pollution haven hypothesis]], which posits that, when large industrialized nations seek to set up factories or offices abroad, they will often look for the cheapest option in terms of resources and labor that offers the land and material access they require (see [[Race to the bottom]]).&lt;ref name="Unmaskingthe"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levinson|first=Arik|author2=M. Scott Taylor|title=Unmasking the Pollution Haven Effect|journal=[[International Economic Review]]|year=2008|volume=49|issue=1|pages=223–54|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2354.2008.00478.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This often comes at the cost of environmentally sound practices. Developing countries with cheap resources and labor tend to have less stringent [[Environmental law|environmental regulations]], and conversely, nations with stricter environmental regulations become more expensive for companies as a result of the costs associated with meeting these standards.  Thus, companies that choose to physically invest in foreign countries tend to (re)locate to the countries with the lowest [[environmental standard]]s or weakest enforcement.

The globalization of food production is associated with a more efficient system of food production. This is because crops are grown in countries with optimum growing conditions. This improvement causes an increase in the world's food supply which encourages improved food security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-i5160e.pdf|title=Food Security and International Trade Unpacking disputed narratives|last=Clapp|first=J|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Norway ===
Norway's limited crop range advocates globalization of food production and availability. The northern-most country in Europe requires trade with other countries to ensure population food demands are met. The degree of self-sufficiency in food production is around 50% in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;Flaten and Hisano, 2007. Food Security Policy in a Food Importing Country: The Case of Norway&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Globalization]], the flow of information, goods, capital, and people across political and geographic boundaries, allows infectious diseases to rapidly spread around the world, while also allowing the alleviation of factors such as hunger and poverty, which are key determinants of global health.&lt;ref name= global&gt;{{cite web |author=Daulaire, N. |title=Globalization and Health |date=July 12, 1999 |work=International RoundtabResponses to Globalization: Rethinking Equity and Health’ jointly organized by the Society for International Development (SID), the World Health Organization (WHO), and The Rockefeller Foundation (RF) |url=http://www.globalhealth.org/assets/html/drmed3.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622194117/http://www.globalhealth.org/assets/html/drmed3.html|archivedate=2011-06-22}} &lt;!-- same as doi:10.1057/palgrave.development.1110077 ? --&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; The spread of diseases across wide geographic scales has increased through history.  Early diseases that spread from Asia to Europe were bubonic plague, influenza of various types, and similar infectious diseases.

In the current era of globalization, the world is more interdependent than at any other time.  Efficient and inexpensive transportation has left few places inaccessible, and increased global trade in agricultural products has brought more and more people into contact with animal diseases that have subsequently jumped [[species]] barriers (see [[zoonosis]]).&lt;ref name= Well &gt;http://www.richardwellsresearch.com/richardwells/pdfs%20and%20documents/BJIC%20Oct&lt;/ref&gt;

Globalization intensified during the [[Age of Discovery|Age of Exploration]], but trading routes had long been established between Asia and Europe, along which diseases were also transmitted.  An increase in travel has helped spread diseases to natives of lands who had not previously been exposed.  When a [[Indigenous peoples|native]] population is infected with a new disease, where they have not developed [[antibodies]] through generations of previous exposure, the new disease tends to run rampant within the population.

[[Etiology]], the modern branch of [[science]] that deals with the causes of [[infectious disease]], recognizes five major modes of disease transmission: airborne, waterborne, bloodborne, by direct contact, and through [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] ([[insect]]s or other creatures that carry germs from one species to another).&lt;ref name=Altman&gt;{{cite book |first=Linda Jacobs |last=Altman |title=Plague and Pestilence: A History of Infectious Disease |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A8dzZAFnHmQC |year=1998 |publisher=Enslow |isbn=978-0-89490-957-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As humans began traveling over seas and across lands which were previously isolated, research suggests that diseases have been spread by all five transmission modes.

==Travel patterns and globalization==
The [[Age of Discovery|Age of Exploration]] generally refers to the period between the 15th and 17th centuries.  During this time, technological advances in [[shipbuilding]] and navigation made it easier for nations to explore outside previous boundaries.  Globalization has had many benefits, for example, new products to [[European ethnic groups|European]]s were discovered, such as [[tea]], [[silk]] and [[sugar]] when Europeans developed new [[trade routes]] around [[Africa]] to [[India]] and the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]], [[Asia]], and eventually running to the [[Americas]].

In addition to trading in goods, many nations began to trade in [[slavery]].  Trading in slaves was another way by which diseases were carried to new locations and peoples, for instance, from sub-Saharan Africa to the Caribbean and the Americas.  During this time, different [[societies]] began to integrate, increasing the concentration of [[human]]s and [[animal]]s in certain places, which led to the emergence of new diseases as some jumped in mutation from animals to humans.

During this time [[magician (paranormal)|sorcerer]]s' and [[witch doctor]]s' treatment of disease was often focused on [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] and [[religion]], and healing the entire [[Human body|body]] and [[soul]], rather than focusing on a few symptoms like [[modern medicine]].  Early medicine often included the use of [[herbs]] and [[meditation]].  Based on archeological evidence, some prehistoric practitioners in both Europe and South America used [[trephining]], making a hole in the skull to release illness.&lt;ref&gt;"One curious method of providing the disease with means of escape from the body was by making a hole, 2.5 to five centimeters across, in the skull of the victim—the practice of trepanning, or trephining. Trepanned skulls of prehistoric date have been found in Britain, France, and other parts of Europe and in Peru. Many of them show evidence of healing and, presumably, of the patient's survival. The practice still exists among primitive people in parts of Algeria, in Melanesia, and perhaps elsewhere, though it is fast becoming extinct. "Medicine, History of",  (2006), in ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. Retrieved November 22, 2006, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online: http://www.search.eb.com/eb/article-35642&lt;/ref&gt;  Severe diseases were often thought of as [[supernatural]] or magical.  The result of the introduction of Eurasian diseases to the Americas was that many more native peoples were killed by disease and [[Microorganism|germs]] than by the colonists' use of guns or other weapons.  Scholars estimate that over a period of four centuries, epidemic diseases wiped out as much as 90 percent of the American indigenous populations.&lt;ref name=Altman /&gt;

In Europe during the age of exploration, diseases such as [[smallpox]], [[measles]] and [[tuberculosis]] (TB) had already been introduced centuries before through trade with Asia and Africa.  People had developed some antibodies to these and other diseases from the Eurasian continent.  When the Europeans traveled to new lands, they carried these diseases with them.  (Note: Scholars believe TB was already endemic in the Americas.)  When such diseases were introduced for the first time to new populations of humans, the effects on the native populations were widespread and deadly. The [[Columbian Exchange]], referring to [[Christopher Columbus]]'s first contact with the native peoples of the [[Caribbean]], began the trade of animals, and plants, and unwittingly began an exchange of diseases.&lt;ref name=Altman /&gt;

It was not until the 1800s that humans began to recognize the existence and role of germs and [[microbes]] in relation to disease.  Although many thinkers had ideas about germs, it was not until [[Louis Pasteur]] spread his [[germ theory|theory about germs]], and the need for washing hands and maintaining [[sanitation]] (particularly in medical practice), that anyone listened.  Many people were quite skeptical, but on May 22, 1881 Pasteur persuasively demonstrated the validity of his germ theory of disease with an early example of [[vaccination]]. The [[anthrax]] vaccine was administered to 25 [[sheep]] while another 25 were used as a control. On May 31, 1881 all of the sheep were exposed to anthrax.  While every sheep in the [[control group]] died, each of the vaccinated sheep survived.&lt;ref name= CDCPT&gt;{{cite journal |author=Trachtman P |title=About the Cover: Experimentation du virus charbonneux: "Le Pelerin," 1922.

His findings, in conjunction with other vaccines that followed, changed the way globalization affected the world.

===Effects of globalization on disease in the modern world===
Modern modes of [[transportation]] allow more people and products to [[travel]] around the world at a faster pace; they also open the airways to the transcontinental movement of infectious disease vectors.&lt;ref name=NAP&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.nap.edu/books/0309100984/html/22.html |title=''The Impact of Globalization on Infectious Disease Emergence and Control: Exploring the Consequences and Opportunities,'' Workshop Summary - Forum on Microbial Threats |publisher=Nap.edu |date=2003-06-01 |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example is the [[West Nile Virus]].  It is believed that this disease reached the [[United States]] via “mosquitoes that crossed the ocean by riding in airplane wheel wells and arrived in New York City in 1999.”&lt;ref name=NAP /&gt; With the use of air travel, people are able to go to foreign lands, contract a disease and not have any symptoms of illness until after they get home, and having exposed others to the disease along the way.

As medicine has progressed, many vaccines and cures have been developed for some of the worst diseases (plague, syphilis, typhus, cholera, malaria) which people suffer.  But, because the [[evolution]] of disease [[organisms]] is very rapid, even with vaccines, there is difficulty providing full [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] to many diseases.  Finding vaccines at all for some diseases remains extremely difficult.  Without vaccines, the global world remains vulnerable to infectious diseases.

Evolution of disease presents a major threat in modern times.  For example, the current "swine flu" or [[Influenza A virus subtype H1N1|H1N1 virus]] is a new strain of an old form of flu, known for centuries as Asian flu based on its origin on that continent.  From 1918–1920, a post-[[World War I]] [[1918 flu pandemic|global influenza epidemic]] killed an estimated 50–100 million people, including half a million in the United States alone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ehistory.osu.edu/osu/reviews/reviewview.cfm?id=72 Dorothy A. Pettit and Janice Bailie, ''Before There Was Swine Flu''; Anne Sealey, Review: "A Cruel Wind: Pandemic Flu in America, 1918-1920"], eHistory, July Review, 2009; Ohio State University, accessed 26 Jan 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  H1N1 is a virus that has evolved from and partially combined with portions of avian, swine, and human flu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=MacKenzie, Debora |title=Swine flu: The predictable pandemic? |journal=New Scientist |issue=2706 |date=29 April 2009 |doi= |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20227063.800-swine-flu-the-predictable-pandemic.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globalization has increased the spread of infectious diseases from South to North, but also the risk of non-communicable diseases by transmission of culture and behavior from North to South. It is important to target and reduce the spread of infectious diseases in developing countries.  However, addressing the risk factors of non-comunicable diseases and lifestyle risks in the South that cause disease, such as use or consumption of tobacco, alcohol, and unhealthy foods, is important as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ollila, Eeva |title=Global Health Priorities-Priorities of the Wealthy? |journal=Globalization and Health |volume=1 |issue=1 |page=6 |year=2005 |doi=10.1186/1744-8603-1-6 |pmid=15847685 |pmc=1143784 |url=http://www.globalizationandhealth.com/content/1/1/6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specific diseases==

===Plague===
[[Bubonic plague]] is a variant of the deadly [[flea]]-borne disease [[Yersinia pestis|plague]], which is caused by the [[Enterobacteriaceae|enterobacteria]] ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'', that devastated human populations beginning in the 14th century.  Bubonic plague is primarily spread by fleas that lived on the [[black rat]], an animal that originated in south Asia and spread to Europe by the 6th century.  It became common to cities and villages, traveling by ship with explorers.  A human would become infected after being bitten by an infected flea.  The first sign of an infection of bubonic plague is swelling of the [[lymph nodes]], and the formation of [[buboes]].  These buboes would first appear in the groin or armpit area, and would often ooze [[pus]] or [[blood]].  Eventually infected individuals would become covered with dark splotches caused by bleeding under the skin.  The symptoms would be accompanied by a high [[fever]], and within four to seven days of infection, more than half the victims would die.&lt;ref name= Mariner&gt;http://www.mariner.org/exploration/index.php?page=faq. Retrieved October 15, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 14th and 15th century, humans did not know that a bacterium was the cause of plague, and efforts to slow the spread of disease were futile.

The first recorded outbreak of plague occurred in [[China]] in the 1330s, a time when China was engaged in substantial trade with western Asia and Europe.  The plague reached Europe in October 1347.  It was thought to have been brought into Europe through the port of [[Messina]], [[Sicily]], by a fleet of Genoese trading ships from [[Caffa|Kaffa]], a seaport on the [[Crimean peninsula]].&lt;ref name= Mariner/&gt;  When the ship left port in Kaffa, many of the inhabitants of the town were dying, and the crew was in a hurry to leave.  By the time the fleet reached Messina, all the crew were either dead or dying; the rats that took passage with the ship slipped unnoticed to shore and carried the disease with them and their fleas.&lt;ref name= Mariner/&gt;

Within Europe, the plague struck port cities first, then followed people along both sea and land trade routes.  It raged through [[Italy]] into [[France]] and the [[British Isles]].  It was carried over the [[Alps]] into [[Switzerland]], and eastward into [[Hungary]] and [[Russia]].&lt;ref name= Mariner/&gt; For a time during the 14th and 15th centuries, the plague would recede.  Every ten to twenty years, it would return.  Later [[epidemics]], however, were never as widespread as the earlier outbreaks, when 60% of the population died.

The plague has never died out.  From 1896–1918 the plague swept through India, taking the lives of over 12.5 million people.  Between 1906 and 1914, the Plague Research Commission was created, and published supplements to the ''Journal of Hygiene''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Catanach, I.J. |title=The "Globalization" of Disease? India and the Plague |journal=[[Journal of World History]] |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=131–153, See p. 131 |date=Spring 2001 |jstor=20078880 |doi=10.1353/jwh.2001.0005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Measles===
[[Measles]] is a highly contagious airborne [[virus]] spread by contact with infected oral and nasal fluids.  When a person with measles coughs or sneezes, he releases microscopic particles into the air.  During the 4- to 12-day [[incubation period]], an infected individual shows no symptoms, but as the disease progresses, the following symptoms appear: runny nose, cough, red eyes, extremely high fever and a rash.

Measles is an [[endemic disease]], meaning that it has been continually present in a community, and many people developed resistance.  In populations that have not been exposed to measles, exposure to the new disease can be devastating.  In 1529, a measles outbreak in [[Cuba]] killed two-thirds of the natives who had previously survived smallpox.  Two years later measles was responsible for the deaths of half the indigenous population of [[Honduras]], and ravaged [[Mexico]], [[Central America]], and the [[Inca]] civilization.&lt;ref name= Mariner/&gt;

Historically, measles was very prevalent throughout the world, as it is highly contagious.  According to the National Immunization Program, 90% of people were infected with measles by age 15, acquiring immunity to further outbreaks.  Until a vaccine was developed in 1963, measles was considered to be deadlier than smallpox.&lt;ref name=CDCMeasles&gt;{{cite book |author=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |chapter=Ch. 12: Measles |chapterurl=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/meas.html |veditors=Atkinson W, Wolfe S, Hamborsky J |title=Epidemiology and Prevention of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases |publisher=Public Health Foundation |location=Washington DC |year=2012 |edition=12th |url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/table-of-contents.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170310044843/https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/table-of-contents.html |archivedate=2017-03-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vaccination reduced the number of reported occurrences by 98%.  Major epidemics have predominantly occurred in unvaccinated populations, particularly among nonwhite [[Hispanic]] and [[African American]] children under 5 years old.&lt;ref name=CDCMeasles /&gt; In 2000 a group of experts determined that measles was no longer endemic in the United States.  The majority of cases that occur are among immigrants from other countries.

===Typhus===
Typhus is caused by ''[[rickettsia]]'', which is transmitted to humans through [[lice]].  The main [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] for [[typhus]] is the [[Oriental rat flea|rat flea]].  Flea bites and infected flea feaces in the respiratory tract are the two most common methods of transmission.  In areas where rats are not common, typhus may also be transmitted through [[cat]] and [[opossum]] fleas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Parola P, Vogelaers D, Roure C, Janbon F, Raoult D |title=Murine typhus in travelers returning from Indonesia |journal=Emerging Infect. Dis. |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=677–80 |year=1998 |pmid=9866749 |pmc=2640266 |doi=10.3201/eid0404.980423}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[incubation period]] of typhus is 7–14 days.  The symptoms start with a [[fever]], then headache, [[rash]], and eventually [[stupor]].  Spontaneous recovery occurs in 80–90% of victims.

The first outbreak of typhus was recorded in 1489.  Historians believe that troops from the [[Balkans]], hired by the Spanish army, brought it to Spain with them.&lt;ref name=Altman /&gt; By 1490 typhus traveled from the eastern [[Mediterranean]] into [[Spain]] and [[Italy]], and by 1494, it had swept across Europe.  From 1500–1914, more soldiers were killed by typhus than from all the combined [[military]] actions during that time.  It was a disease associated with the crowded conditions of urban poverty and [[refugees]] as well.  Finally, during [[World War I]], governments instituted preventative [[delousing]] measures among the armed forces and other groups, and the disease began to decline.&lt;ref name="USAMRMC"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of [[antibiotic]]s has allowed disease to be controlled within two days of taking a 200&amp;nbsp;mg dose of [[tetracycline]].

===Syphilis===
Syphilis is a [[sexually transmitted disease]] that causes open sores, [[delirium]] and rotting skin, and is characterized by [[genital ulcer]]s.  Syphilis can also do damage to the nervous system, brain and heart.  The disease can be transmitted from mother to child.

The origins of [[syphilis]] are unknown, and some historians argue that it descended from a twenty-thousand-year-old African [[zoonosis]].  Other historians place its emergence in the [[New World]], arguing that the crews of Columbus’s ships first brought the disease to [[Europe]].&lt;ref name=Altman /&gt; The first recorded case of syphilis occurred in [[Naples]] in 1495, after [[Charles VIII of France|King Charles VIII]] of France besieged the city of Naples, [[Italy]].  The soldiers, and the prostitutes who followed their camps, came from all corners of Europe.  When they went home, they took the disease with them and spread it across the continent.&lt;ref name=Altman /&gt;

=== Smallpox ===
[[Smallpox]] is a highly contagious disease caused by the [[Variola virus]].  There are four variations of smallpox; variola major, variola minor, haemorrhagic, and malignant, with the most common being variola major and variola minor.  Symptoms of the disease including [[hemorrhaging]], [[blindness]], back ache, [[vomiting]], which generally occur shortly after the 12- to 17-day incubation period.  The virus begins to attack [[skin]] cells, and eventually leads to an eruption of pimples that cover the whole body.  As the disease progresses, the [[pimples]] fill up with pus or merge.  This merging results in a sheet that can detach the bottom layer from the top layer of skin.  The disease is easily transmitted through airborne pathways (coughing, sneezing, and breathing), as well as through contaminated bedding, clothing or other fabrics,

It is believed that smallpox first emerged over 3000 years ago, probably in [[India]] or [[Egypt]].  There have been numerous recorded devastating [[epidemic]]s throughout the world, with high losses of life.

Smallpox was a common disease in Eurasia in the 15th century, and was spread by [[Exploration|explorers]] and invaders.  After Columbus landed on the island of [[Hispaniola]] during his second voyage in 1493, local people started to die of a [[virulent]] [[infection]].  Before the smallpox epidemic started, more than one million indigenous people had lived on the [[island]]; afterward, only ten thousand had survived.&lt;ref name=Altman /&gt;

During the 16th century, Spanish soldiers introduced smallpox by contact with natives of the [[Aztec]] capital [[Tenochtitlan]].  A devastating epidemic broke out among the indigenous people, killing thousands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mariner.org/exploration/index.php?type=explorersection&amp;id=200 |title=The Mariners' Museum &amp;#124; EXPLORATION through the AGES |publisher=Mariner.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1617, smallpox reached [[Massachusetts]], probably brought by earlier explorers to [[Nova Scotia]], [[Canada]].”&lt;ref name=Altman /&gt;  By 1638 the disease had broken out among people in [[Boston, Massachusetts]].  In 1721 people fled the city after an outbreak, but the residents  spread the disease to others throughout the [[thirteen colonies]].  Smallpox broke out in six separate epidemics in the United States through 1968.

The [[smallpox vaccine]] was developed in 1798 by [[Edward Jenner]]. By 1979 the disease had been completely [[Eradication of infectious diseases|eradicated]], with no new outbreaks.  The [[WHO]] stopped providing vaccinations and by 1986, vaccination was no longer necessary to anyone in the world except in the event of future outbreak.

=== Leprosy ===
[[Leprosy]], also known as Hansen’s Disease, is caused by a [[bacillus]], ''[[Mycobacterium leprae]]''.  It is a [[chronic disease]] with an incubation period of up to five years.  Symptoms often include irritation or erosion of the skin, and effects on the [[peripheral nerves]], mucosa of the [[upper respiratory tract]] and eyes.  The most common sign of leprosy are pale reddish spots on the skin that lack sensation.

Leprosy probably originated in [[India]], more than four thousand years ago.  It was prevalent in ancient societies in [[China]], Egypt and India, and was transmitted throughout the world by various traveling groups, including [[Roman Legion]]naires, [[Crusaders]], Spanish [[conquistador]]s, Asian [[seafarer]]s, European colonists, and Arab, African, and American slave traders.  Some historians believe that [[Alexander the Great]]'s troops brought leprosy from India to Europe during the 3rd century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Leprosy - MSN Encarta |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761578788/Leprosy.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwq4ZAH0?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761578788/Leprosy.html |archivedate=2009-11-01 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of the crusaders and other travelers, leprosy reached [[epidemic]] proportions by the 13th century.

Once detected, leprosy can be cured using multi-drug therapy, composed of two or three antibiotics, depending on the type of leprosy. In 1991 the World Health Assembly began an attempt to eliminate leprosy.  By 2005 116 of 122 countries were reported to be free of leprosy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wpro.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs_20070129/en/ | title=Western Pacific Regional Leprosy Situation in 2005  Fact sheet 28, January 2007 | publisher=WPRO | year=2007 | accessdate=5 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malaria===
On Nov. 6, 1880 [[Alphonse Laveran]] discovered that [[malaria]] (then called "Marsh Fever") was a [[protozoa]]n parasite, and that mosquitoes carry and transmit malaria.&lt;ref&gt;National Center for Infectious Diseases, Division of Parasitic Diseases. "Lavaran and the Discovery of the Malaria Parasite" [article online] 2004. Available from https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/history/laveran.htm. Accessed on Nov. 10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Malaria is a [[protozoan]] [[infectious disease]] that is generally transmitted to [[humans]] by mosquitoes between dusk and dawn. The European variety, known as "vivax" after the ''[[Plasmodium vivax]]'' parasite, causes a relatively mild, yet chronically aggravating disease.  The west African variety is caused by the [[sporozoan]] parasite, ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]'', and results in a severely debilitating and deadly disease.

Malaria was common in parts of the world where it has now disappeared, as the vast majority of Europe (disease of African descent are particularly diffused in the Empire romain) and North America . In some parts of England, [[mortality rate|mortality]] due to malaria was comparable to that of [[sub-Saharan Africa]] today. Although [[William Shakespeare]] was born at the beginning of a colder period called the "[[Little Ice Age]]", he knew enough ravages of this disease to include in eight parts. Plasmodium vivax lasted until 1958 in the [[polder]]s of Belgium and the Netherlands.
In the 1500s, it was the European settlers and their slaves who probably brought malaria on the American continent (we know that Columbus was suffering from this disease before his arrival in the new land). The Spanish [[Jesuit missionaries]] saw the Indians bordering on Lake Loxa Peru used the [[Cinchona bark]] powder to treat fevers. However, there is no reference to malaria in the medical literature of the Maya or [[Aztecs]]. The use of the bark of the "fever tree" was introduced into European medicine by Jesuit missionaries whose Barbabe Cobo who experimented in 1632 and also exports, so that the precious powder s' also called "Jesuit powder" . A study in 2012 of thousands of genetic markers for Plasmodium falciparum samples confirmed the African origin of the parasite in South America (Europeans themselves have been affected by this disease through Africa): it borrowed from the mid-sixteenth century and the mid-nineteenth the two main roads of the slave trade, the first leading to the north of South America (Colombia) by the Spanish, the second most leading south (Brazil) by Portugueses.

Parts of the [[Third World]] are more affected by malaria than the rest of the world. For instance, many inhabitants of sub-Saharan Africa are affected by recurring attacks of malaria throughout their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kaplan |first=Robert D. |chapter=The Coming Anarchy |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=VLwlnhq01RIC&amp;pg=PA40 |editor=O’Meara, P. |editor2=Mehlinger, H.D. |editor3=Krain, M. |title=Globalization and the Challenges of a New Century: A Reader |year=2000 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=978-0-253-21355-6 |pages=40–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many areas of Africa, there is limited [[running water]].  The residents' use of wells and [[cistern]]s provides many sites for the breeding of mosquitoes and spread of the disease.  Mosquitoes use areas of [[standing water]] like [[marshes]], [[wetlands]], and water drums to breed.

===Tuberculosis===
The [[bacterium]] that causes [[tuberculosis]], ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'',  is generally spread when an infected person [[cough]]s and another person inhales the bacteria. Once inhaled TB frequently grows in the [[lungs]], but can spread to any part of the body.  Although TB is highly contagious, in most cases the human body is able to fend off the bacteria.  But, TB can remain [[dormancy|dormant]] in the body for years, and become active unexpectedly. If and when the disease does become active in the body, it can multiply rapidly, causing the person to develop many symptoms including cough (sometimes with blood), night sweats, fever, chest pains, loss of appetite and loss of weight. This disease can occur in both adults and children and is especially common among those with weak or undeveloped [[immune system]]s.

Tuberculosis (TB) has been one of history’s greatest killers, taking the lives of over 3 million people annually.  It has been called the "white plague". According to the WHO, approximately fifty percent of people infected with TB today live in [[Asia]].  It is the most prevalent, life-threatening infection among [[AIDS]] patients.  It has increased in areas where HIV [[seroprevalence]] is high.&lt;ref name=TBF&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wpro.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/20120306_tuberculosis/en/index.html | title=Tuberculosis facts. | publisher=WPRO | date=March 2012 | accessdate=5 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Air travel]] and the other methods of travel which have made global interaction easier, have increased the spread of TB across different societies. Luckily, the [[Bacillus Calmette-Guérin|BCG vaccine]] was developed, which prevents TB meningitis and [[miliary TB]] in childhood.  But, the vaccine does not provide substantial protection against the more virulent forms of TB found among adults. Most forms of TB can be treated with antibiotics to kill the bacteria. The two antibiotics most commonly used are [[rifampicin]] and [[isoniazid]].  There are dangers, however, of a rise of antibiotic-resistant TB.  The TB treatment regimen is lengthy, and difficult for poor and disorganized people to complete, increasing resistance of bacteria.&lt;ref name=TBF /&gt; Antibiotic-resistant TB is also known as "[[multidrug-resistant tuberculosis]]." "Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis" is a pandemic that is on the rise. Patients with MDR-TB are mostly young adults who are not infected with HIV or have other existing illness. Due to the lack of health care infrastructure in underdeveloped countries, there is a debate as to whether treating MDR-TB will be cost effective or not. The reason is the high cost of "second-line" antituberculosis medications. It has been argued that the reason the cost of treating patients with MDR-TB is high is because there has been a shift in focus in the medical field, in particular the rise of AIDS, which is now the world's leading infectious cause of death. Nonetheless, it is still important to put in the effort to help and treat patients with "multidrug-resistant tuberculosis" in poor countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Major Infectious Diseases in the World — To Treat or Not to Treat? | author=Farmer, P. | journal=The New England Journal of Medicine | year=2001 | month=| volume=345 | issue=3|pages=208–210 | doi=10.1056/nejm200107193450310 | pmid=11463018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HIV/AIDS===
[[HIV and AIDS]] are among the newest and deadliest diseases. According to the [[World Health Organization]], it is unknown where the [[HIV]] [[virus]] originated, but it appeared to move from animals to humans.  It may have been isolated within many groups throughout the world.  It is believed that HIV arose from another, less harmful virus, that mutated and became more virulent.  The first two AIDS/HIV cases were detected in 1981.  As of 2013, an estimated 1.3 million persons in the [[United States]] were living with HIV or AIDS,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nat.org.uk/HIV-in-the-UK/HIV-Statistics/International-statistics.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210000903/http://www.nat.org.uk/HIV-in-the-UK/HIV-Statistics/International-statistics.aspx |archivedate=2015-02-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; almost 110,000 in the UK &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nat.org.uk/HIV-in-the-UK/HIV-Statistics/Latest-UK-statistics/People-with-HIV-in-UK.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212121444/http://www.nat.org.uk/HIV-in-the-UK/HIV-Statistics/Latest-UK-statistics/People-with-HIV-in-UK.aspx |archivedate=2015-02-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and an estimated 35 million people worldwide are living with HIV”.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/hiv/data/epi_core_dec2014.png?ua=1&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite efforts in numerous countries, awareness and prevention programs have not been effective enough to reduce the numbers of new HIV cases in many parts of the world, where it is associated with high mobility of men, poverty and sexual mores among certain populations.  Uganda has had an effective program, however. Even in countries where the epidemic has a very high impact, such as Swaziland and South Africa, a large proportion of the population do not believe they are at risk of becoming infected. Even in countries such as the UK, there is no significant decline in certain at-risk communities. 2014 saw the greatest number of new diagnoses in gay men, the equivalent of nine being diagnosed a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nat.org.uk/Media-and-Blog/Press-Releases/2014/November/PHE_Stat_Gay_Men_Stats.aspx#sthash.pgSuiy7L.dpuf | title=Press Releases &amp;#124; National AIDS Trust - NAT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, HIV prevention methods focused primarily on preventing the sexual transmission of HIV through behaviour change. The ABC Approach - "Abstinence, Be faithful, Use a Condom". However, by the mid-2000s, it became evident that effective HIV prevention requires more than that and that interventions need to take into account underlying socio-cultural, economic, political, legal and other contextual factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.avert.org/hiv-prevention-programmes.htm#sthash.8IYVPGF1.dpuf | title=HIV prevention programmes overview| date=2015-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ebola===
{{main|2014 West Africa Ebola virus outbreak}}
The [[Ebola]] outbreak, which was the 26th outbreak since 1976, started in [[Guinea]] in March 2014. The [[WHO]] warned that the number of [[Ebola]] patients could rise to 20,000, and said that it used $489m (£294m) to contain Ebola within six to nine months.&lt;ref name=guardian2014aug28EO&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/28/ebola-cases-rise-20000-world-health-organisation-west-africa-death-toll Ebola cases in west Africa could rise to 20,000 says WHO] Lisa O'Carroll, Society, theguardian, 28 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The outbreak was accelerating. [[Medecins sans Frontieres]] has just opened a new Ebola hospital in [[Monrovia]], and after one week it is already a capacity of 120 patients. It said that the number of patients seeking treatment at its new Monrovia centre was increasing faster than they could handle both in terms of the number of beds and the capacity of the staff, adding that it was struggling to cope with the caseload in the Liberian capital. Lindis Hurum, MSF's emergency coordinator in Monrovia, said that it was humanitarian emergency and they needed a full-scale humanitarian response.&lt;ref name=guardian2014aug28EO /&gt; [[Brice de la Vinge]], MSF director of operations, said that it was not until five months after the declaration of the Ebola outbreak that serious discussions started about international leadership and coordination, and said that it was not acceptable.

===Leptospirosis===
[[Leptospirosis]], also known as '''field fever''' is an infection caused by ''Leptospira''. Symptoms can range from none to mild such as headaches, muscle pains, and fevers; to severe with bleeding from the lungs or meningitis. ''Leptospira'' is transmitted by both wild and domestic animals, most commonly by rodents. It is often transmitted by animal urine or by water or soil containing animal urine coming into contact with breaks in the skin, eyes, mouth, or nose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Slack A | year = 2010 | title = Leptospirosis | url = | journal = Australian Family Physician | volume = 39 | issue = 7| pages = 495–8 | pmid = 20628664 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The countries with the highest reported incidence are located in the Asia-Pacific region (Seychelles, India, Sri Lanka and Thailand) with incidence rates over 10 per 1000,000 people s well as in Latin America and the Caribbean (Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, Jamaica, El Salvador, Uruguay, Cuba, Nicaragua and Costa Rica)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pappas G, Papadimitriou P, Siozopoulou V, Christou L, Akritidis N | year = 2008 | title = The globalization of leptospirosis: worldwide incidence trends | url = | journal = Int J Infect Dis | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 351–357 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the rise in global travel and eco-tourism &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Leptospirosis, Challenge Eco | year = 2000 | title = participants | url = | journal = Commun Dis Rep CDR Wkly | volume = 10 | issue = | page = 341 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has led to dramatic changes in the epidemiology of leptospirosis, and travelers from around the world have become exposed to the threat of leptospirosis. Despite decreasing prevalence of leptospirosis in endemic regions, previously non-endemic countries are now reporting increasing numbers of cases due to recreational exposure &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wasinski B, Dutkiewicz J | year = 2013 | title = Leptospirosis–current risk factors connected with human activity and the environment | url = | journal = Ann Agric Environ Med | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 239–244 }}&lt;/ref&gt; International travelers engaged in adventure sports are directly exposed to numerous infectious agents in the environment and now comprise a growing proportion of cases worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bandara Medhani, Ananda Mahesha, Wickramage Kolitha, Berger Elisabeth, Agampodi Suneth | year = 2014 | title = Globalization of leptospirosis through travel and migration | url = | journal = Globalization and Health | volume = 10 | issue = | page = 61 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-communicable disease==

[[Globalization]] can benefit people with [[non-communicable diseases]] such as heart problems or mental health problems. Global trade and rules set forth by the [[World Trade Organization]] can actually benefit the health of people by making their incomes higher, allowing them to afford better health care. While it has to be admitted making many non-communicable diseases more likely as well. Also the national income of a country, mostly obtained by trading on the global market, is important because it dictates how much a government spends on health care for its citizens. It also has to be acknowledged that an expansion in the definition of disease often accompanies development, so the net effect is not clearly beneficial due to this and other effects of increased affluence. Metabolic syndrome is one obvious example. Although poorer countries have not yet experienced this and are still suffering from diseases listed above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Beaglehole R, Yach D |title=Globalisation and the prevention and control of non-communicable disease: the neglected chronic diseases of adults |journal=Lancet |volume=362 |issue=9387 |pages=903–8 |date=September 2003 |pmid=13678979 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)14335-8 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(03)14335-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Health geography''' is the application of geographical information, perspectives, and methods to the study of [[health]], [[disease]], and [[health care]].

== Overview ==

The study of health geography has been influenced by repositioning medical geography within the field of [[social geography]] due to a shift towards a social model in health care, rather than a medical model&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Rethinking the health consequences of social class and social mobility. Social Science &amp; Medicine. 
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.11.037 &lt;/ref&gt;. This advocates for the redefinition of health and health care away from prevention and treatment of illness only to one of promoting well-being in general.  Under this model, some previous illnesses (e.g., mental ill health) are recognized as behavior disturbances only, and other types of medicine (e.g., complementary or [[alternative medicine]] and [[traditional medicine]]) are studied by the [[medicine]] researchers, sometimes with the aid of health geographers without [[medical education]]. This shift changes the definition of care, no longer limiting it to spaces such as hospitals or doctor's offices. Also, the social model gives priority to the intimate encounters performed at non-traditional spaces of medicine and healthcare as well as to the individuals as [[health consumerism|health consumers]].&lt;ref name= "Philo2"&gt;Philo, Chris (2009). "Health and Health Care". In Gregory, Derek; Johnston, Ron; Pratt, Geraldine et. al ''The Dictionary of Human Geography (Fifth Edition)''. Oxford:Blackwell. pp.325-326&lt;/ref&gt;

This alternative methodological approach means that medical geography is broadened to incorporate philosophies such as [[Political Economy#Current approaches|Marxian political economy]], [[structuralism]], [[interactionism|social interactionism]], [[humanism]], [[feminism]] and [[queer theory]].&lt;ref name= "Philo"&gt;Philo, Chris (2009). "Medical Geography". In Gregory, Derek; Johnston, Ron; Pratt, Geraldine et. al ''The Dictionary of Human Geography (Fifth Edition)''. Oxford:Blackwell. pp.451-453&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The relationship between space and health dates back to [[Hippocrates]], who stated that "airs, waters, places" all played significant roles impacting human health and history.&lt;ref name= "Philo" /&gt; A classic piece of research in health geography was done in 1854 as [[Broad Street cholera outbreak|a cholera outbreak]] gripped a neighborhood in [[London]]. Death tolls rang around the clock and the people feared that they were being infected by vapors coming from the ground. [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] predicted that if he could locate the source of the disease, it could be contained. He drew maps demonstrating the homes of people who had died of cholera and the locations of water pumps. He found that one pump, the public pump on Broad Street, was central to most of the victims. He concluded that infected water from the pump was the culprit.  He instructed the authorities to remove the handle to the pump, making it unusable. As a result, the number of new cholera cases decreased.

==Areas of study==
Health geography is considered to be divided into two distinct elements. The first of which is focused on geographies of disease and ill health, involving [[descriptive research]] quantifying disease frequencies and distributions, and [[Analytic and enumerative statistical studies|analytic research]] concerned with finding what characteristics make an individual or [[population]] susceptible to disease. This requires an understanding of [[epidemiology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ocaña-Riola |first=Ricardo |year=2010 |title=Common errors in disease mapping |journal=Geospatial Health |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=139–54 |pmid=20503184 |url=http://www.geospatialhealth.unina.it/fulltext.php?f=pdf&amp;ida=90 |doi=10.4081/gh.2010.196}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The second component of health geography is the geography of health care, primarily facility location, accessibility, and utilization.  This requires the use of [[spatial analysis]] and often borrows from [[behavioral economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/1353-8292(95)00002-4 | title=Coming out: exposing social theory in medical geography | journal=Health | date=1995 | volume=1 | issue=1 | pages=5–14 | first=Andréa | last=Litva}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Geographies of disease and ill health ===
Hsenting health risks, from [[natural disaster]]s, to interpersonal [[violence]], [[stress (biology)|stress]], and other potential dangers.&lt;ref name="Philo2" /&gt;

=== Geography of health care provision ===
[[File:Coverage by Type of Health Insurance- 2008 and 2009p25.pdf|thumb]]
Although healthcare is a public good, it is not equally available to all [[individuals]]. Demand for public services is continuously increasing. People need advance knowledge and the latest prediction technology, that health geography offers. The latest example of such technology is Telemedicine. Many people in the United States are not able to access proper healthcare because of inequality in health insurance and the means to afford medical care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2016/02/money-quality-health-care-longer-life/|title=The costs of inequality: Money = quality health care = longer life|newspaper=Harvard Gazette|access-date=2017-02-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mobility and Disease Tracking

With the advent of mobile technology and its spread, it is now possible to track [[individual mobility]]. By correlating the movement of individuals through tracking the devices using access towers or other tracking systems, it is now possible to determine and even control disease spread. While [[privacy law]]s question the legality of tracking individuals, the commercial mobile service providers are using covert techniques or obtaining government waivers to allow permission to track people .

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3230">The '''INF World Rankings''' are published by the [[International Netball Federation]] (INF) to make it possible to compare the relative strengths of internationally active national [[netball]] teams. Initially, rankings were based on the results from the [[World Netball Championships]], and released after the conclusion of each event, every four years. A new ranking system was implemented on 11 February 2008, wherein teams are ranked based on international [[Test match (netball)|tests]] played, currently since July 2010. Teams appear on the rankings list once they have played eight international test matches, starting from July 2010. The rankings are updated by the INF every month. Australia and New Zealand have dominated the INF world rankings in previous years and they are the only two netball nations to have ever held the number one world ranking since its introduction in 2009.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14785">The '''ITF Rankings''' are the current rankings of national teams by the [[International Tennis Federation]] in both men's and women's [[tennis]]. The ITF produces two sets of rankings—the ITF [[Davis Cup]] Nations Ranking for male national teams, and the ITF [[Fed Cup]] Nations Ranking for female national teams. Both sets of rankings measure the success of all nations participating in both competitions.

The ITF Davis Cup Nations Ranking was launched at the end of 2001 and the ITF Fed Cup Nations Ranking was introduced a year later. Both rankings are updated following every World Group round and are used for [[seed (sports)|seeding]] the highest ranked teams in the draws for each group in the competitions' structures.

==Ranking method==

The ITF [[Davis Cup]] and [[Fed Cup]] rankings are based in a rolling four year cumulative system. However, the points total for each nation is calculated following a weighted sum formula, in which recent results are weighted more heavily.&lt;ref name="ITFDavisCupRankingsExplained"&gt;{{cite web|work=daviscup.com|publisher=International Tennis Federation|title=Rankings Explained| url = http://www.daviscup.com/en/rankings/rankings-explained.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ITFFedCupRankingsExplained"&gt;{{cite web|work=fedcup.com|publisher=International Tennis Federation|title=How the Rankings Work| url = http://www.fedcup.com/en/rankings/rankings-explained.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; After each World Group round, the ranking period adjusts, and points earned in the last year period have a weighting factor of 100% in the points total. At the same time, the weighting factor for the points earned until the same round in the previous three years is reduced to 75% (for points earned one to two years ago), 50% (for points earned two to three years ago) and 25% (for points earned three to four years ago).

Ranking points are awarded only to the winning nation of a competition tie at every round. Victories in World Group rounds are worth more points than those in Zone Groups, and ties at the later rounds of the competition are progressively worth more points. Bonus points are also awarded for a nation that defeats a higher-ranked nation, but only if the latter nation is ranked in the top 64 for the Davis Cup, or in the top 75 for the Fed Cup. Unique to the Davis Cup, there is an additional bonus for a nation that wins a tie in the opponent's home ground: a 25% bonus is added to the total of round points and ranking bonus points (if any). At the Fed Cup only, nations that win by walkover are awarded round points but no bonus points, and no points are awarded for consolation events.

&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; In the Groups I, II and III a nation's points are determined by its overall finishing position. Formats vary according to the numbers of nations playing each year so the value of each win alters too. However the maximum points a nation can win at each level remains constant.&lt;ref name="ITFFedCupRankingsExplained" /&gt;

The '''UIC''' ({{lang-fr|'''Union Internationale des Chemins de fer'''}}) or '''International Union of Railways''' is an international [[rail transport]] industry body.

== History ==

The railways of Europe originated as many separate concerns, and there were many border changes after [[World War I]] and the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. Colonial railways were the responsibility of the mother country. Into this environment the UIC was created on 17 October 1922,&lt;ref&gt;http://uic.org/1922-UIC-a-long-life-organisation&lt;/ref&gt; with the aim of standardising industry practices.

Ticket revenue sharing was originally undertaken with the [[UIC Franc]] currency equivalent.  [[UIC classification]] and [[UIC Country Code]]s allowed precise determination of rolling stock capabilities and ownership, with wagons assigned unique [[UIC wagon numbers]].  The 1990s [[GSM-R]] radio telecommunication system is an international [[interoperability]] specification covering voice and signalling systems for railway communications whose specification is maintained by the International Union of Railways project [[ERTMS]].

== Mission ==

The UIC's mission is "to promote rail transport at world level and meet the challenges of mobility and sustainable development."&lt;ref name="UIC website"&gt;[http://www.uic.org/spip.php?article528 UIC Overview] as at 12 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objectives ==

The UIC's main objectives&lt;ref name="UIC website"/&gt; are to:

* Facilitate the sharing of best practices among members (benchmarking)
* Support members in their efforts to develop new business and new areas of activities
* Propose new ways to improve technical and environmental performance
* Promote interoperability, create new world standards for railways (including common standards with other transport modes)
* Develop centres of competence (High Speed, Safety, Security, e-Business, …)

== Members ==

When founded in 1922 the UIC had 51 members from 29 countries, including [[Japan]] and [[China]]. They were soon joined by the [[USSR]], the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]]. Today, the UIC has 194 members&lt;ref&gt;[http://vademecum.uic.org/en/ VADEMECUM (LIST OF UIC MEMBERS)]&lt;/ref&gt; across 5 continents.&lt;ref name="UIC website"/&gt; Of these there are:
* 73 active members (including from [[Europe]], [[Russia]], the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]], [[South Africa]], [[China]], [[Pakistan]], [[Taiwan]], [[India]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Afghanistan]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2013/12/18/afghanistan-becomes-uic-member&lt;/ref&gt; and companies operating worldwide such as [[Veolia]] Transport)
* 68 associate members (including from [[Asia]], [[Africa]], [[Americas|America]] and [[Australia]])
* 53 affiliate members (related or ancillary businesses or services)

On 12 November 2010, the UIC opened an African regional office in [[Tunis]] with the support of [[SNCFT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.railwaysafrica.com/blog/2010/11/iru-office-opened-in-tunis/|accessdate=2010-11-27|title=UIC OFFICE FOR AFRICA OPENED IN TUNIS|website=Railways Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:UIC pallet marking.JPG|thumbnail|UIC mark on an [[EUR-pallet|EPAL]] pallet. EPAL has criticised the UIC for poor quality assurance processes which, according to EPAL, permit [[counterfeit]] or inferior quality pallets to enter the European pallet pool.&lt;ref&gt;EPAL, ''EPAL assumes responsibility for the pallet pool's safety and quality'', 12 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In order to provide a common understanding and reduce potential confusion, the UIC has established standard international railway terminology and a trilingual (English-French-German) thesaurus of terms. The thesaurus was the result of cooperation with the [[European Conference of Ministers of Transport]] (ECMT/{{lang|fr|CEMT}}) and was published in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.uic.org/spip.php?article1593| title=Transport Thesaurus| year=1995| accessdate=May 20, 2009| publisher=UIC| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150606032638/http://www.uic.org/spip.php?article1593| archivedate=6 June 2015| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classification of railway vehicles ==

The UIC has established systems for the classification of [[UIC identification marking for tractive stock|locomotives]] and their [[UIC classification|axle arrangements]], [[UIC classification of railway coaches|coaches]] and [[UIC classification of goods wagons|goods wagons]].

== Some UIC regulations ==

UIC plays an important role in standardization of railway parts, data and terminology. Therefore, UIC codes (also known as '''UIC leaflet''') are developed since the beginning of UIC's work. A new term for these UIC leaflets is used by UIC for better understanding: '''International Railway Solution''' ('''IRS''').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Magnien|first=Airy|title=UIC e-news|url=http://uic.org/com/uic-e-news/394|publisher=UIC|accessdate=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[UIC code]]s are:

* [[UIC 568]] The 13-corded standardized connection [[Electrical cable|cable]] with connector is used to transmit data and commands between the [[locomotive]] and the carriages of a [[passenger train]].
* UIC 592-2 Large containers for transport on wagons - Technical conditions to be fulfilled by large containers accepted for use in international traffic. Describes the classes and categories of large containers, handling characteristics,  identification markings, and special conditions applying to large tank containers.
* UIC 592-3 Large containers (CT), swap bodies (CM) and transport frames for horizontal transhipment (CA) - Standard report on acceptance tests.
* UIC 592-4 Swap bodies for grab handling and spreader gripping - Technical conditions. Swap bodies are the removable superstructures of road transport vehicles. Their dimensions and some of their fittings are standardised, particularly  dimensions, strength parameters and securing devices, of the road vehicle, the wagon and transhipment arrangements (grab-handling grooves, lower securing parts and, in special cases, upper securing parts).
* UIC 596-5 Transport of road vehicles on wagons - Technical organisation - Conveyance of semi-trailers with P coding or N coding on recess wagons. This leaflet sets out regulations and provisions for semi-trailers with normal road transport characteristics for conveyance on fixed-recess carrier wagons. The provisions are valid for semi-trailers, gantry equipment/industrial trucks with grab handles, recess wagon types 1a and 1b in accordance with UIC Leaflet 571-4.
* UIC 596-6 Conveyance of road vehicles on wagons - Technical organisation - Conditions for coding combined-transport load units and combined-transport lines. The leaflet sets out the coding and organisation of loading units in respect of road vehicles on wagons, designed to ensure compatibility of loading units (LU) with the permissible profile for combined transport lines. The provisions aim to facilitate LU identification to speed-up international traffic movements. They are applicable to semi-trailers, swap bodies, roller units loaded on wagons and bogies in combined transport operations.

'''International communication''' (also referred to as the ''[[study of global communication]]'' or '''transnational communication''') is the communication practice that occurs across international borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fortner|first=R. S.|title=International communication: History, conflict, and control of the global metropolis|year=1993|publisher=Wadsworth Pub. Co.|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The need for international communication was due to the increasing effects and influences of globalization. As a field of study, international communication is a branch of [[communication studies]], concerned with the scope of "government-to-government", "business-to-business", and "people-to-people" interactions at a global level.&lt;ref&gt;Thussu, D.K.(2006).''International Communication: Continuity and Change''. London:Hodder Education.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, international communication is being taught at colleges across the United States. Due to the increasingly globalized market, employees who possess the ability to effectively communicate across cultures are in high demand. International communication "encompasses political, economic, social, cultural and military concerns".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fortner|first=R. S.|title=International communication: History, conflict, and control of the global metropolis|year=1993|publisher=Wadsworth Pub. Co.|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical context ==

===Communication and empire===
Efficient communication networks played crucial roles in establishing ancient imperial authority and international trade. The extent of empire could be used as an 'indication of the [[communication efficiency|efficiency of communication]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Innis|first=H.|title=Empire and communications|year=1972|publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]|location=Toronto|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient empires such as Rome, Persia and China, all utilized writing in collecting information and dispersing, creating enormous postal and dispatch systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=S.|title=News and society in the Greek pols|year=1996|publisher=Duck worth|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as in fifteenth century, news had been disseminated trans-nationally in Europe. 'The wheat traders of Venice, the silver traders of Antwerp, the merchants of Nuremberg and their trading partners shared economic newsletters and created common values and beliefs in the rights of capital.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Voltmeter|first=Ingrid|title=International Communication Theory in Transition: Parameters of the New Global Public Sphere|url=http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/papers/volkmer.html|accessdate=23 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The advent of telegraph and time–space compression===
{{see also|time space compression}}
In 1837, [[Samuel Morse]] invented [[telegraph]]. Given its speed and reliability in delivering information, telegraph offered opportunities for capital and military expansion. As showed in Table 1.1, the establishment of cable hardware signifies global power order in late nineteenth and early twentieth century.

===The era of news agencies===
The newspaper industry and international telegraph networks mutually facilitated each other. As the supply and demand of newspaper industry rapidly increased in nineteenth century, [[news agencies]] were established successively. [[The French Havas Agency]] was founded in 1835, the German agency [[Wolff]]in 1849 and the British [[Reuters]] in 1851. These three European agencies, which started to operate internationally, were all subsidized by their respective governments.

=== Radio broadcasting ===
Western countries seized the chances to implement radio communication after the first radio transmissions of human voice in 1902. But the two mechanisms of radio broadcasting were distinctively different. In the USA, [[the Radio Act of 1927]] confirm its status as an advertising-funded commercial enterprise, while in Britain, the public broadcasting pioneer [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] set up in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Thussu, D.K.(2006).''International Communication: Continuity and Change''. London:Hodder Education.&lt;/ref&gt; During the First World War and the Second World War, radio broadcasting played a significant role in both domestic public opinion management and international diplomacy propaganda abroad. Even in the Cold War times, this radio-dominated international communication still featured in propaganda respective ideologies. The prominent example is [[Voice of America|the Voice of America]], which ran a global network to indoctrinate "American dream" to its international audience.

===Demanding a new communication order===
Since the cold war officially ended in 1990, the intense relations of super powers halted with the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the emergence of the Third World countries, the unequally developed communication order can no longer exist. The Third World called for ceasing their marginalized communication status. Especially when international communications stepped into the information age, 'the convergence of telecommunication and computing and the ability to move all type of data – pictures, words, sounds – via the Internet have revolutionized international information exchange.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thussu|first=D.K.|title=International Communication: Continuity and Change|year=2006|publisher=Hodder Education|pages=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Considerations for international communication ===
When communicating internationally it is important to take culture into consideration. Though English has become the language of business, many businesses fail to recognize that the language used does not determine how business is conducted. Therefore, it is important to understand that intercultural and international communication are interchangeable.

As a tourist it may be acceptable to maintain the cultural norms from a country of origin when visiting, though attempting to adapt would be appreciated. However, when conducting business it is important to recognize cultural differences, especially when communicating.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, Robert. "Intercultural Business Communication". Teaching English as a Second or Foreign Language. Oxford University Press. Retrieved 16 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; At the turn of the century there was a large amount of research based on the needs of those that travel abroad in order to commercialize products or services. The list of researchers includes Hofstede, 1991; Storti, 1994; Ansari &amp; Jackson, 1995; Cushner &amp; Brislin, 1996; Adler, 1997; Mead, 1998; and Marx, 1999. From those studies Gibson's volume becomes an important source of information for business professionals interested in succeeding internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gibson|first1=Robert|title=Intercultural Business Communication|url=http://www.cc.kyoto-su.ac.jp/information/tesl-ej/ej33/r8.html|website=Teaching English as a Second or Foreign Language|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|accessdate=16 November 2014|ref=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; As explained by Douglas Storey, there was a change in style and strategy of American diplomacy since 1979 after the first addition of Glen Fisher's book appeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Storey|first1=Douglas|title=International Communication|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/216913937|publisher=Journalism Quarterly|accessdate=18 November 2014|ref=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the reason for international communication it is important to understand that international communication is not limited to the language spoken during communication.

== Scope and approaches of international communication research ==
International communication is widely spread and multilayered in contemporary society, however it is not considered as a separate academic discipline because of its overlapping with other subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stevenson|first=R.|title=Defining international communication as a field|journal=Journalism Quarterly|year=1992|issue=69|pages=543–553}}&lt;/ref&gt; International communication is 'a topic field rather than a discipline field' and international communication studies is a mode of 'organizing inquiry'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peters|first=J.|title=Genealogical notes on "the field"|journal=Journal of Communication|year=1993|volume=43|issue=4|pages=132–139|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1993.tb01313.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John D. H. Downing]] proposed ten categories within which international communication should be conducted
# [[theories of international communication]]
# [[core international communication processes]]
# [[global media firms]]
# [[global media policies]]
# [[Global news flow]]s
# [[world cinema]]
# [[development communication]]
# [[the Internet]]
# [[intellectual property law]]
# [[non-hegemonic communication flows]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Downing|first=John D.

One of the most obvious manifestations of international communication are [[world news]], when the media of one country cover news from abroad. But, apart from journalism, international communication also occurs in other areas (culture, technology, sciences) and the nature of the "information" that is circulated can be classified in a wide variety of categories, such as cultural (music, films, sports, TV shows from one country to another), scientific (research papers published abroad, scientific exchange or cooperation), and intelligence (diplomacy reports, international espionage, etc.).

Typically the study of international communication includes a deep attention to the circulation of news among different countries (and the resulting imbalances, from which came the concept of [[news flow]]), the power of media organizations (such as [[media conglomerate|conglomerates]] and news agencies), issues such as [[cultural imperialism]] and [[media imperialism]], and the political role that international cooperation can have in enhancing the media industry (and society as a whole) in a given region, such as proposed by [[development communication]] or [[communication for development]].

Some renowned scholars in international communication include [[Wilbur Schramm]], [[Ithiel de Sola Pool]], [[Johan Galtung]], [[Anthony Smith (producer)|Anthony Smith]], Robert Stevenson, [[Jeremy Tunstall]], [[Armand Mattelart]], [[Oliver Boyd-Barrett]], Ali Mohammadi, [[Annabelle Sreberny]], [[Cees J. Hamelink]], [[Daya Kishan Thussu]] and [[Chris Paterson]]. The ''[[International Communication Gazette]]'' and the ''[[Journal of International Communication]]'' are reference journals in this field.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="59949">'''Foreign broadcasting''' is [[broadcasting]] with a foreign element.

The foreign element may be the territory of the audience, its [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], or both.
* Foreign country and ethnicity: an [[International broadcasting|external service]] aimed at ''foreign societies'' in general. Its purpose may be information about the country of origin, about the target country from an outside point of view as well as [[Religious broadcasting|missionary]] or [[Commercial broadcasting|commercial]] purposes.
* Foreign territory: an external service aimed at ''[[expatriate]]s''. A special audience among expatriates is armed forces personnel, for whom broadcasting is often done not only from the home country, but also from within the country of [[Military deployment|deployment]].
* Foreign ethnicity: a service for ''foreign [[community|communities]] within the country of broadcasting'' (like [[Immigration|migrant]]s, [[refugee]]s, [[tourism|tourists]]), which in turn is to be distinguished from broadcasting for indigenous and other non-foreign groups (''see also [[Minority language broadcasting]]'').

The "[[UKUSA Agreement|Five Eyes]]" (FVEY) refers to an alliance comprising [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]]. These countries are bound by the multilateral [[UKUSA Agreement]] for joint cooperation in [[signals intelligence]], [[Defense (military)#Military intelligence|military intelligence]], and [[Human intelligence (intelligence collection)|human intelligence]]. In recent years, documents of the FVEY have shown that they are intentionally spying on one another's citizens and sharing the collected information with each other in order to circumvent restrictive [[Constitutional law|domestic regulations]] on spying.{{refn|&lt;ref name="fiveeyes1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cox|first=James|title=Canada and the Five Eyes Intelligence Community|url=http://www.cdfai.org/PDF/Canada%20and%20the%20Five%20Eyes%20Intelligence%20Community.pdf|publisher=[[Canadian Defence and Foreign Affairs Institute]]|date=December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140205220700/http://www.cdfai.org/PDF/Canada%20and%20the%20Five%20Eyes%20Intelligence%20Community.pdf|archivedate=2014-02-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Five Eyes |url=http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/call/thesaurus/toc.asp?id=37622 |publisher=[[United States Army Combined Arms Center]] |accessdate=18 January 2014 |archivedate=18 January 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6MicvdCtb?url=http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/call/thesaurus/toc.asp?id=37622 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PKI Interoperability with FVEY Partner Nations on the NIPRNet |url=http://www.doncio.navy.mil/ContentView.aspx?ID=3978 |publisher=United States Department of the Navy |accessdate=18 January 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Micdat2m?url=http://www.doncio.navy.mil/ContentView.aspx?ID=3978 |archivedate=18 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=James|last=Ball|title=US and UK struck secret deal to allow NSA to 'unmask' Britons' personal data|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/20/us-uk-secret-deal-surveillance-personal-data|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|accessdate=18 January 2014|date=20 November 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140120033754/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/20/us-uk-secret-deal-surveillance-personal-data |archivedate=20 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ewen|last=MacAskill|title=Revealed: Australian spy agency offered to share data about ordinary citizens|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/02/revealed-australian-spy-agency-offered-to-share-data-about-ordinary-citizens|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|accessdate=18 January 2014|date=2 December 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140118092435/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/02/revealed-australian-spy-agency-offered-to-share-data-about-ordinary-citizens|archivedate=18 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Watt|first=Nicholas|title=NSA 'offers intelligence to British counterparts to skirt UK law'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jun/10/nsa-offers-intelligence-british-counterparts-blunkett|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|accessdate=19 January 2014|date=10 June 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131229105310/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jun/10/nsa-offers-intelligence-british-counterparts-blunkett|archivedate=29 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/06/21/uk-usa-security-britain-idUKBRE95K10620130621 British spy agency taps cables, shares with U.S. NSA – Guardian] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140125021330/http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/06/21/uk-usa-security-britain-idUKBRE95K10620130621 |date=2014-01-25 }}, ''[[Reuters]]'', 21 June 2013.

In order for a person to be included in the list, there must be well-documented evidence based on reliable sources, such as [[leak]]ed or [[Declassification|declassified]] FVEY documents or [[whistleblower]] accounts, which demonstrate that the person involved is, or was, intentionally targeted for surveillance.

In 1971, he moved to [[New York City]] to join activists in the United States to protest against the [[Vietnam War]]. Over the next 12&amp;nbsp;months, the U.S. government launched an extensive surveillance operation to monitor his activities and to deport him back to Britain. The operation was conducted by the FBI with the help of MI5.

&lt;!-- Definition --&gt;
'''Malnutrition''' is a condition that results from eating a [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]] in which one or more [[nutrient]]s are either not enough or are too much such that the diet causes health problems.&lt;ref name=FFL2010&gt;{{cite book|title=Facts for life|date=2010|publisher=United Nations Children's Fund|location=New York|isbn=978-92-806-4466-1|pages=61 and 75|edition=4th|url=http://www.unicef.org/nutrition/files/Facts_for_Life_EN_010810.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dor2017&gt;{{DorlandsDict|five/000062745|malnutrition}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may involve [[calories]], [[protein]], [[carbohydrates]], [[vitamin]]s or [[dietary element|mineral]]s.&lt;ref name="FFL2010" /&gt; Not enough nutrients is called '''undernutrition''' or '''undernourishment''' while too much is called [[overnutrition]].&lt;ref name=Young2012&gt;{{cite book|last1=Young|first1=E.M.|title=Food and development|date=2012|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon, Oxon|isbn=9781135999414|pages=36–38|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XhwKwNzJVjQC&amp;pg=PA36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malnutrition is often used to specifically refer to undernutrition where an individual is not getting enough calories, protein, or [[micronutrients]].&lt;ref name=Young2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jones2011&gt;{{cite book|title=Essentials of International Health|date=2011|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers|isbn=9781449667719|page=194|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lt7TqZPZSlIC&amp;pg=PA194}}&lt;/ref&gt; If undernutrition occurs during [[pregnancy]], or before two years of age, it may result in permanent problems with physical and mental development.&lt;ref name=FFL2010/&gt; Extreme undernourishment, known as [[starvation]], may have symptoms that include: a short height, thin body, very poor energy levels, and swollen legs and [[abdomen]].&lt;ref name=FFL2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Young2012/&gt; People also often get infections and are frequently [[hypothermia|cold]].&lt;ref name=Young2012/&gt; The symptoms of [[micronutrient deficiencies]] depend on the micronutrient that is lacking.&lt;ref name=Young2012/&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause --&gt;
Undernourishment is most often due to not enough high-quality food being available to eat.&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt; This is often related to high food prices and [[poverty]].&lt;ref name=FFL2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt; A lack of [[breastfeeding]] may contribute, as may a number of [[infectious diseases]] such as: [[gastroenteritis]], [[pneumonia]], [[malaria]], and [[measles]], which increase nutrient requirements.&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt; There are two main types of undernutrition: [[protein-energy malnutrition]] and dietary deficiencies.&lt;ref name=Jones2011/&gt; Protein-energy malnutrition has two severe forms: [[marasmus]] (a lack of protein and calories) and [[kwashiorkor]] (a lack of just protein).&lt;ref name=Young2012/&gt; Common micronutrient deficiencies include: a lack of [[iron deficiency|iron]], [[iodine deficiency|iodine]], and [[vitamin A deficiency|vitamin A]].&lt;ref name=Young2012/&gt; During [[pregnancy]], due to the body's increased need, deficiencies may become more common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=Arora |editor-first1=Mala  |editor-last2=Konje |editor-first2=Justin C. |title=Recurrent pregnancy loss |date=2007 |publisher=Jaypee Bros.

Unless specifically mentioned otherwise, the term malnutrition refers to undernutrition for the remainder of this article. Malnutrition can be divided into two different types, SAM and MAM. SAM refers to children with severe acute malnutrition. MAM refers to moderate acute malnutrition.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Sathish Subramanian |author2=Sayeeda Huq |author3=Tanya Yatsunenko |author4=Rashidul Haque |author5=Mustafa Mahfuz |author6=Mohammed A.

===Undernutrition and overnutrition===
Malnutrition is caused by eating a diet in which [[nutrient]]s are ''not enough'' or is ''too much'' such that it causes health problems.&lt;ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nikolaos Katsilambros|title=Clinical Nutrition in Practice|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-4777-7|pages=37|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pJHU1m7BEP8C&amp;pg=PT46}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a category of diseases that includes undernutrition and [[overnutrition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WHO, nutrition experts take action on malnutrition |url=http://www.who.int/nutrition/pressnote_action_on_malnutrition/en/|work=World Health Organization |accessdate=February 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overnutrition can result in [[obesity]] and being [[overweight]]. In some [[developing countries]], overnutrition in the form of [[obesity]] is beginning to present within the same communities as undernutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Progress For Children: A Report Card On Nutrition|url=http://www.unicef.org/nutrition/files/Progress_for_Children_-_No._4.pdf|publisher=UNICEF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the term malnutrition is commonly used to refer to undernutrition only.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nikolaos Katsilambros|title=Clinical Nutrition in Practice|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-4777-7|pages=39|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pJHU1m7BEP8C&amp;pg=PT46}}&lt;/ref&gt; This applies particularly to the context of development cooperation. Therefore, "malnutrition" in documents by the [[World Health Organization]], [[UNICEF]], [[Save the Children]] or other international [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs) usually is equated to undernutrition.

===Protein-energy malnutrition===

Undernutrition is sometimes used as a synonym of [[protein–energy malnutrition]] (PEM).&lt;ref name="Young2012" /&gt; While other include both [[micronutrient deficiencies]] and protein energy malnutrition in its definition.&lt;ref name="Jones2011" /&gt; It differs from [[calorie restriction]] in that calorie restriction may not result in negative health effects. The term hypoalimentation means underfeeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|four/000051473|hypoalimentation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "severe malnutrition" or "severe undernutrition" is often used to refer specifically to [[protein–energy malnutrition|PEM]].&lt;ref name="Nutrition in pediatrics"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last3=Walker |editor-first3=W. Allan |editor-first=Christopher |editor-last=Duggan |editor-first2=John B. |editor-last2=Watkins |title=Nutrition in pediatrics: basic science, clinical application|year=2008|publisher=BC Decker|location=Hamilton|isbn=978-1-55009-361-2|pages=127–141|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wSTISCdSIosC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Nutrition+in+pediatrics+:+basic+science,+clinical+application#v=onepage&amp;q=Nutrition%20in%20pediatrics%20%3A%20basic%20science%2C%20clinical%20application&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; PEM is often associated with micronutrient deficiency.&lt;ref name="Nutrition in pediatrics" /&gt; Two forms of PEM are [[kwashiorkor]] and [[marasmus]], and they commonly coexist.&lt;ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)" /&gt;

==== Kwashiorkor ====
[[Kwashiorkor]] is mainly caused by inadequate protein intake.&lt;ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)" /&gt; The main symptoms are [[edema]], wasting, liver enlargement, hypoalbuminaemia, steatosis, and possibly depigmentation of skin and hair.&lt;ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)" /&gt; Kwashiorkor is further identified by swelling of the belly, which is deceiving of actual nutritional status.&lt;ref name="Chowdhury 2008" /&gt; The term means ‘displaced child’ and is derived from a Ghana language of West Africa, means "the sickness the older one gets when the next baby is born," as this is when the older child is deprived of breast feeding and weaned to a diet composed largely of carbohydrates.&lt;ref name="listeningga"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Listening to the Ga: Cicely Williams' Discovery of Kwashiorkor on the Gold Coast|author=Stanton J|year=2001|journal=Clio Medica: Studies in the History of Medicine and Health|volume=61|pages=149–71|pmid=11603151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Marasmus====
[[Marasmus]] (‘to waste away’) is caused by an inadequate intake of protein and energy. The main symptoms are severe wasting, leaving little or no edema, minimal subcutaneous fat, severe muscle wasting, and non-normal serum albumin levels.&lt;ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)" /&gt; Marasmus can result from a sustained diet of inadequate energy and protein, and the metabolism adapts to prolong survival.&lt;ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)" /&gt; It is traditionally seen in famine, significant food restriction, or more severe cases of [[anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]].&lt;ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)" /&gt; Conditions are characterized by extreme wasting of the muscles and a gaunt expression.&lt;ref name="Chowdhury 2008" /&gt;

===Undernutrition, hunger===
Undernutrition encompasses [[stunted growth]] (stunting), wasting, and deficiencies of essential vitamins and minerals (collectively referred to as micronutrients). The term [[hunger]], which describes a feeling of discomfort from not eating, has been used to describe undernutrition, especially in reference to food insecurity.&lt;ref name="Black2008" /&gt;

===Definition by Gomez===
In 1956, Gómez and Galvan studied factors associated with death in a group of malnourished (undernourished) children in a hospital in Mexico City, Mexico and defined categories of malnutrition: first, second, and third degree.&lt;ref name="Stevenson 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stevenson|first1=R. D.|author2=Conaway, M. R.|title=Weight and Mortality Rates: "Gomez Classification" for Children With Cerebral Palsy?|journal=Pediatrics|date=August 2011|volume=128|issue=2|pages=e436–e437|doi=10.1542/peds.2011-1472|pmid=21768321}}&lt;/ref&gt; The degrees were based on weight below a specified percentage of median weight for age.&lt;ref name="Grover 2009" /&gt; The risk of death increases with increasing degree of malnutrition.&lt;ref name="Stevenson 2011" /&gt; An adaptation of Gomez's original classification is still used today. While it provides a way to compare malnutrition within and between populations, the classification has been criticized for being "arbitrary" and for not considering overweight as a form of malnutrition.

===Definition by Waterlow===
[[John Waterlow|John Conrad Waterlow]] established a new classification for malnutrition.&lt;ref name="Waterlow 1972"/&gt; Instead of using just weight for age measurements, the classification established by Waterlow combines weight-for-height (indicating acute episodes of malnutrition) with height-for-age to show the stunting that results from chronic malnutrition.&lt;ref name="J. C. Waterlow"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Watts|first=Geoff|title=John Conrad Waterlow|journal=The Lancet|date=December 2010|volume=376|issue=9757|pages=1982|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)62252-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; One advantage of the Waterlow classification over the Gomez classification is that weight for height can be examined even if ages are not known.&lt;ref name="Waterlow 1972"/&gt;

[[Avitaminosis|Vitamin-deficiency-related diseases]] (such as [[scurvy]] and [[rickets]]).

Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) can result from a child not eating for 4 to 6 hours. Hypoglycemia should be considered if there is lethargy, limpness, convulsion, or loss of consciousness. If blood sugar can be measured immediately and quickly, perform a finger or heel stick.

==Causes==
{{See also|List of types of malnutrition}}
[[File:Andersonvillesurvivor.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|[[Union Army]] soldier on his release from [[Andersonville prison]], 1865]]
Major causes of malnutrition include poverty and food prices, dietary practices and agricultural productivity, with many individual cases being a mixture of several factors.  [[Clinical malnutrition]], such as [[cachexia]], is a major burden also in [[Developed country|developed countries]]. Various scales of analysis also have to be considered in order to determine the sociopolitical causes of malnutrition. For example, the population of a community that is within poor governments, may be at risk if the area lacks health-related services, but on a smaller scale certain households or individuals may be at an even higher risk due to differences in income levels, access to land, or levels of education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fotso | first1 = J.

===Dietary practices===

==== Undernutrition ====
A lack of adequate breastfeeding leads to malnutrition in infants and children, associated with the deaths of an estimated one million children annually. Illegal advertising of breast milk substitutes contributed to malnutrition and continued three decades after its 1981 prohibition under the ''WHO International Code of Marketing Breast Milk Substitutes''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Arch Dis Child |date=June 2012 |volume=97 |issue=6 |pages=529–32 |title=Marketing breast milk substitutes: problems and perils throughout the world |author=Brady JP |pmid=22419779 |pmc=3371222 |doi=10.1136/archdischild-2011-301299 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maternal malnutrition can also factor into the poor health or death of a baby. Over 800,000 [[neonatal death]] have occurred because of deficient growth of the fetus in the mother's womb.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/261533.php|title=Malnutrition Kills Over 3 Million Children Annually Worldwide|work=Medical News Today|access-date=2018-02-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deriving too much of one's diet from a single source, such as eating almost exclusively corn or rice, can cause malnutrition. This may either be from a lack of education about proper nutrition, or from only having access to a single food source.&lt;ref name=Burchi&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Int J Environ Res Public Health |date=February 2011 |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=358–73 |title=The role of food and nutrition system approaches in tackling hidden hunger |vauthors=Burchi F, Fanzo J, Frison E |pmid=21556191 |pmc=3084466 |doi=10.3390/ijerph8020358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not just the total amount of calories that matters but specific nutritional deficiencies such as [[vitamin A deficiency]], [[iron deficiency]] or [[zinc deficiency]] can also increase risk of death.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;UNICEF (2013). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/2148 Improving Child Nutrition - The achievable imperative for global progress]. UNICEF&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Overnutrition ====
Overnutrition caused by [[overeating]] is also a form of malnutrition. In the United States, more than half of all adults are now overweight — a condition that, like hunger, increases susceptibility to disease and disability, reduces worker productivity, and lowers life expectancy.&lt;ref name="Gardner00" /&gt; Overeating is much more common in the United States, where for the majority of people, access to food is not an issue. Many parts of the world have access to a surplus of non-nutritious food, in addition to increased sedentary lifestyles. Yale psychologist Kelly Brownell calls this a "[[toxic food environment]]" where fat and sugar laden foods have taken precedence over healthy nutritious foods.&lt;ref name="Gardner00" /&gt;

The issue in these developed countries is choosing the right kind of food. More fast food is consumed per capita in the United States than in any other country. The reason for this mass consumption of fast food is its affordability and accessibility. Often fast food, low in cost and nutrition, is high in calories and heavily promoted. When these eating habits are combined with increasingly urbanized, automated, and more sedentary lifestyles, it becomes clear why weight gain is difficult to avoid.&lt;ref name="Gardner00_5"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gardner|first1=Gary|last2=Halweil|first2=Brian|year=2000|title=Escaping Hunger, Escaping Excess|url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/488|journal=World Watch|volume=13|issue=4|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only does obesity occur in developed countries, problems are also occurring in developing countries in areas where income is on the rise.&lt;ref name="Gardner00" /&gt; Overeating is also a problem in countries where hunger and poverty persist. In China, consumption of high-fat foods has increased while consumption of rice and other goods has decreased.&lt;ref name="Gardner00" /&gt;

Overeating leads to many diseases, such as heart disease and diabetes, that may result in death.

===Poverty and food prices===
[[File:Starved child.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|A child with extreme malnutrition]]

In Bangladesh, poor socioeconomic position was associated with chronic malnutrition since it inhibits purchase of nutritious foods such as milk, meat, poultry, and fruits.&lt;ref name="Factors in Bangladesh"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Khan |first1=MM|author2=Kraemer, A|title=Factors associated with being underweight, overweight and obese among ever-married non-pregnant urban women in Bangladesh|journal=Singapore Medical Journal|date=August 2009|volume=50|issue=8|pages=804–13|pmid=19710981}}&lt;/ref&gt; As much as food shortages may be a contributing factor to malnutrition in countries with lack of technology, the [[FAO]] (Food and Agriculture Organization) has estimated that eighty percent of malnourished children living in the developing world live in countries that produce food surpluses.&lt;ref name=Gardner00&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gardner |first1=Gary |last2=Halweil |first2=Brian |title=Escaping Hunger, Escaping Excess |journal=World Watch |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=24 |year=2000 |url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/488}}&lt;/ref&gt; The economist [[Amartya Sen]] observed that, in recent decades, famine has always been a problem of food distribution and/or poverty, as there has been sufficient food to feed the whole population of the world. He states that malnutrition and [[famine]] were more related to problems of food distribution and purchasing power.&lt;ref name=Sen81&gt;{{cite book |first=Amartya Kumar |last=Sen |title=Poverty and famines: An essay on entitlement and deprivation |url=https://books.google.com/?id=BzU_AwAAQBAJ |year=1981 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-828463-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is argued that commodity speculators are increasing the cost of food. As the real estate bubble in the United States was collapsing, it is said that trillions of dollars moved to invest in food and primary commodities, causing the 2007–2008 [[food price crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The role of speculators in the global food crisis |agency= |work= |newspaper=Spiegel Online |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,549187,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of [[biofuel]]s as a replacement for traditional fuels raises the price of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Biofuel use increasing poverty |agency= |work= |newspaper=BBC News |date= June 25, 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7472532.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations]] special rapporteur on the right to food, [[Jean Ziegler]] proposes that agricultural waste, such as corn cobs and banana leaves, rather than crops themselves be used as fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Biofuels 'crime against humanity' |agency= |work= |newspaper=BBC News |date= October 27, 2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7065061.stm |first=Grant |last=Ferrett}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agricultural productivity===
Local food shortages can be caused by a lack of arable land, adverse weather, lower farming skills such as [[crop rotation]], or by a lack of technology or resources needed for the higher yields found in modern [[agriculture]], such as fertilizers, pesticides, irrigation, machinery and storage facilities. As a result of widespread poverty, farmers cannot afford or governments cannot provide the resources necessary to improve local yields. The World Bank and some wealthy donor countries also press nations that depend on aid to cut or eliminate subsidized agricultural inputs such as fertilizer, in the name of [[free market]] policies even as the United States and Europe extensively subsidized their own farmers.&lt;ref name=newyorktimes&gt;{{cite news |title=Ending Famine, Simply by Ignoring the Experts |agency= |work= |newspaper=New York Times |date=December 2, 2007 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/02/world/africa/02malawi.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1 |first=Celia W. |last=Dugger}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Zambia: fertile but hungry |agency= |work= |newspaper=BBC News |date= February 6, 2006|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4678592.stm |first=Peter |last=Biles}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many, if not most, farmers cannot afford fertilizer at market prices, leading to low agricultural production and wages and high, unaffordable food prices.&lt;ref name=newyorktimes/&gt;
Reasons for the unavailability of fertilizer include moves to stop supplying fertilizer on [[environmental movement|environmental]] grounds, cited as the obstacle to feeding Africa by the [[Green Revolution]] pioneers [[Norman Borlaug]] and Keith Rosenberg.&lt;ref name=atlantic&gt;{{cite news |title=Forgotten benefactor of humanity |agency= |work= |newspaper=The Atlantic |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/issues/97jan/borlaug/borlaug.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future threats===
There are a number of potential disruptions to global food supply that could cause widespread malnutrition.

[[Global warming]] is of importance to food security, with 95 percent of all malnourished peoples living in the relatively stable climate region of the sub-tropics and tropics. According to the latest [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] reports, temperature increases in these regions are "very likely."&lt;ref name=ipcc&gt;{{cite web |title= Climate Change 2007: Synthesis Report |date=November 12–17, 2007 |publisher=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/syr/ar4_syr.pdf |accessdate=January 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even small changes in temperatures can lead to increased frequency of extreme weather conditions.&lt;ref name=ipcc /&gt; Many of these have great impact on agricultural production and hence nutrition. For example, the 1998–2001 central Asian drought brought about an 80 percent livestock loss and 50 percent reduction in wheat and barley crops in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;Battisti, David S. "Climate Change in Developing Countries." University of Washington. Seattle. October 27, 2008.{{vn|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar figures were present in other nations. An increase in extreme weather such as drought in regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa would have even greater consequences in terms of malnutrition. Even without an increase of extreme weather events, a simple increase in temperature reduces the productivity of many crop species, also decreasing food security in these regions.&lt;ref name=ipcc /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Black, Richard |title=Rice yields falling under global warming |agency= |newspaper=BBC News; Science &amp; Environment |date=August 9, 2010 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-10918591}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Colony collapse disorder]] is a phenomenon where bees die in large numbers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aginfo.psu.edu/news/2007/1/HoneyBees.htm Honey Bee Die-Off Alarms Beekeepers, Crop growers and researchers]&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[list of crop plants pollinated by bees|many agricultural crops worldwide are pollinated by bees]], this represents a threat to the supply of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Vanishing bees threaten US crops |newspaper=BBC News |date= March 11, 2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6438373.stm |first=Matt |last=Wells}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food security===

{{Main|Food security}}
The effort to bring modern agricultural techniques found in the West, such as nitrogen fertilizers and pesticides, to Asia, called the [[Green Revolution]], resulted in increased [[food production]] and corresponding decreases in prices and malnutrition similar to those seen earlier in Western nations. This was possible because of existing infrastructure and institutions that are in short supply in Africa, such as a system of roads or public seed companies that made seeds available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=In Africa, prosperity from seeds falls short |agency= |work= |newspaper=New York Times |date= October 10, 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/10/world/africa/10rice.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin |first=Celia W. |last=Dugger}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investments in agriculture, such as subsidized fertilizers and seeds, increases food harvest and reduces food prices.&lt;ref name=newyorktimes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Barclay, Eliza |title=How a Kenyan village tripled its corn harvest |agency= |work= |newspaper=Christian Science Monitor |date=June 18, 2008 |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0618/p07s01-woaf.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the case of Malawi, almost five million of its 13 million people used to need emergency food aid. However, after the government changed policy and subsidies for fertilizer and seed were introduced against World Bank strictures, farmers produced record-breaking corn harvests as production leaped to 3.4 million in 2007 from 1.2 million in 2005, making Malawi a major food exporter.&lt;ref name=newyorktimes/&gt; This lowered food prices and increased wages for farm workers.&lt;ref name=newyorktimes/&gt; Such investments in agriculture are still needed in other African countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The country has one of the highest  prevalence of malnutrition even though it is blessed with great agricultural potential John Ulimwengu explains in his article for D+C.&lt;ref&gt;

In Nigeria, the use of imported Ready to Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF) has been used to treat malnutrition in the North. ''Soy Kunu'', a locally sourced and prepared blend consisting of peanut, millet and soya beans may also be used.&lt;ref name=Soykunu&gt;{{cite news |title=Severe Malnutrition, A Disturbance in Nigerian Health Sector |agency= |work= Public Health Nigeria|newspaper= |date=October 12, 2018 |url=https://publichealthng.com/severe-malnutrition-a-disturbance-in-nigerian-health-sector/ |first1=Obasi |last1=Chinedu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New technology in agricultural production also has great potential to combat undernutrition.&lt;ref&gt;Li, Jiming, Yeyun Xin and Longping Yuan. (2010). Pushing the Yield Frontier: Hybrid rice in China. In MillionsFed: Proved Success in Agriculture Development. Washington, DC: International Policy Research Institute&lt;/ref&gt; By improving agricultural yields, farmers could reduce poverty by increasing income as well as open up area for diversification of crops for household use. The World Bank itself claims to be part of the solution to malnutrition, asserting that the best way for countries to succeed in breaking the cycle of poverty and malnutrition is to build export-led economies that will give them the financial means to buy foodstuffs on the world market.

===Economics===
There is a growing realization among aid groups that giving cash or cash vouchers instead of food is a cheaper, faster, and more efficient way to deliver help to the hungry, particularly in areas where food is available but unaffordable.&lt;ref name="csmonitor"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Africa/2008/0604/p01s02-woaf.html|title=UN aid debate: give cash not food?|date=June 4, 2008|work=|newspaper=Christian Science Monitor|agency=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN's [[World Food Program]], the biggest non-governmental distributor of food, announced that it will begin distributing cash and vouchers instead of food in some areas, which Josette Sheeran, the WFP's executive director, described as a "revolution" in food aid.&lt;ref name="csmonitor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wfp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2899|title=Cash roll-out to help hunger hot spots|date=December 8, 2008|publisher=World Food Programme|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212124012/http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2899|archivedate=February 12, 2009|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aid agency [[Concern Worldwide]] is piloting a method through a mobile phone operator, Safaricom, which runs a money transfer program that allows cash to be sent from one part of the country to another.&lt;ref name="csmonitor" /&gt;

However, for people in a drought living a long way from and with limited access to markets, delivering food may be the most appropriate way to help.&lt;ref name="csmonitor" /&gt; [[Fred Cuny]] stated that "the chances of saving lives at the outset of a relief operation are greatly reduced when food is imported. By the time it arrives in the country and gets to people, many will have died."&lt;ref&gt;Andrew S. Natsios (Administrator U.S. Agency for International Development)&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. law, which requires buying food at home rather than where the hungry live, is inefficient because approximately half of what is spent goes for transport.&lt;ref name="Let them eat micronutrients" /&gt; Cuny further pointed out "studies of every recent famine have shown that food was available in-country — though not always in the immediate food deficit area" and "even though by local standards the prices are too high for the poor to purchase it, it would usually be cheaper for a donor to buy the hoarded food at the inflated price than to import it from abroad."&lt;ref&gt;Memorandum to former Representative Steve Solarz (United States, Democratic Party, New York), July 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MontrealSoupKitchen1931.jpg|thumb|A soup kitchen in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], [[Canada]] in 1931.]]
[[Food bank]]s and [[soup kitchen]]s address malnutrition in places where people lack money to buy food.  A [[basic income]] has been proposed as a way to ensure that everyone has enough money to buy food and other basic needs; it is a form of [[social security]] in which all citizens or residents of a country regularly receive an unconditional sum of money, either from a government or some other public institution, in addition to any income received from elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.canadiansocialresearch.net/ssrgai.htm |title = Improving Social Security in Canada Guaranteed Annual Income: A Supplementary Paper |publisher = Government of Canada |year = 1994 |accessdate = 30 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ethiopia]] has been pioneering a program that has now become part of the World Bank's prescribed method for coping with a food crisis and had been seen by aid organizations as a model of how to best help hungry nations. Through the country's main food assistance program, the Productive Safety Net Program, Ethiopia has been giving rural residents who are chronically short of food, a chance to work for food or cash. Foreign aid organizations like the World Food Program were then able to buy food locally from surplus areas to distribute in areas with a shortage of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0506/p01s06-woaf.html?page=2|title=A model of African food aid is now in trouble|date=May 6, 2008|work=|newspaper=Christian Science Monitor|agency=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethiopia been pioneering a program, and Brazil has established a recycling program for organic waste that benefits farmers, urban poor, and the city in general. City residents separate organic waste from their garbage, bag it, and then exchange it for fresh fruit and vegetables from local farmers. As a result, the country's waste is reduced and the urban poor get a steady supply of nutritious food.&lt;ref name="Gardner00_5" /&gt;

===World population===

Restricting population size is a proposed solution. [[Thomas Malthus]] argued that population growth could be controlled by natural disasters and voluntary limits through "moral restraint."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Thomas Robert |last1=Malthus |authorlink=Thomas Malthus |first2=Philip |last2= Appleman |title=An essay on the principle of population: text, sources and background, criticism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=raGGQgAACAAJ |year=1976 |publisher=Norton |isbn=978-0-393-09202-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Chapman suggests that an intervention through government policies is a necessary ingredient of curtailing global population growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chapman | first1 = R. | title = No room at the inn, or why population problems are not all economic | journal = Population and Environment | volume = 21 | pages = 81–97 | year = 1999 | pmid =  | pmc =  | doi = 10.1007/BF02436122 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The interdependence and complementarity of population growth with poverty and malnutrition (as well as the environment) is also recognised by the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/theme/environment/index.shtml|title=Environment - United Nations Population Division {{!}} Department of Economic and Social Affairs|website=www.un.org|language=EN|access-date=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 200 million women worldwide do not have adequate access to family planning services. According to the World Health Organisation, "Family planning is key to slowing unsustainable population growth and the resulting negative impacts on the economy, environment, and national and regional development efforts".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/family-planning-contraception|title=Family planning/Contraception|website=World Health Organization|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there are many who believe that the world has more than enough resources to sustain its population. Instead, these theorists point to unequal distribution of resources and under- or unutilized arable land as the cause for malnutrition problems.&lt;ref&gt;Ohlin, G. (1967). Population control and economic development. Paris: Dev Centers, OECD.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nielson, K. (1992). Global Justice, Capitalism and the Third World. (R. A. Wilkons, Ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Amartya Sen advocates that, "no matter how a famine is caused, methods of breaking it call for a large supply of food in the [[Public Distribution System|public distribution system]]. This applies not only to organizing rationing and control, but also to undertaking work programmes and other methods of increasing purchasing power for those hit by shifts in exchange entitlements in a general inflationary situation."&lt;ref name="Sen81" /&gt; 

===Food sovereignty===

{{Main|Food sovereignty}}
One suggested policy framework to resolve access issues is termed [[food sovereignty]]—the right of peoples to define their own food, agriculture, livestock, and fisheries systems, in contrast to having food largely subjected to international market forces. Food First is one of the primary think tanks working to build support for food sovereignty. Neoliberals advocate for an increasing role of the free market.

===Health facilities===

Another possible long term solution would be to increase access to health facilities to rural parts of the world. These facilities could monitor undernourished children, act as supplemental food distribution centers, and provide education on dietary needs. These types of facilities have already proven very successful in countries such as Peru and Ghana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Waters | first1 = H. R. | last2 = Penny | first2 = M.

===Breastfeeding===

As of 2016 is estimated that about 821,000 deaths of children less than five years old could be prevented globally per year through more widespread breastfeeding.&lt;ref name="Lancet2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Victora|first1=CG|last2=Bahl|first2=R|last3=Barros|first3=AJ|last4=França|first4=GV|last5=Horton|first5=S|last6=Krasevec|first6=J|last7=Murch|first7=S|last8=Sankar|first8=MJ|last9=Walker|first9=N|date=January 30, 2016|title=Breastfeeding in the 21st century: epidemiology, mechanisms, and lifelong effect.|journal=Lancet|volume=387|issue=10017|pages=475–90|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(15)01024-7|pmid=26869575|last10=Rollins|first10=NC|last11=Lancet Breastfeeding Series|first11=Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to reducing infant death, breast milk feeding provides an important source of micronutrients, clinically proven to bolster the immune system of children, and provide long-term defenses against non-communicable and allergic diseases.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lessen|first=Rachelle|last2=Kavanagh|first2=Katherine|date=2015-03-01|title=Position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics: Promoting and Supporting Breastfeeding|url=http://jandonline.org/article/S2212-2672(14)01876-0/fulltext|journal=Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics|language=English|volume=115|issue=3|pages=444–449|doi=10.1016/j.jand.2014.12.014|pmid=25721389|issn=2212-2672}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breastfeeding has also been shown to improve cognitive abilities in children, with a strong correlation to individual educational achievements.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Balogun|first=Olukunmi Omobolanle|last2=Dagvadorj|first2=Amarjagal|last3=Anigo|first3=Kola Mathew|last4=Ota|first4=Erika|last5=Sasaki|first5=Satoshi|date=2015-10-01|title=Factors influencing breastfeeding exclusivity during the first 6 months of life in developing countries: a quantitative and qualitative systematic review|journal=Maternal &amp; Child Nutrition|language=en|volume=11|issue=4|pages=433–451|doi=10.1111/mcn.12180|pmid=25857205|issn=1740-8709}}&lt;/ref&gt; As previously noted, lack of proper breastfeeding is a major factor in child mortality rates, and a primary determinant of disease development for children.

==== Barriers to breastfeeding ====

Breastfeeding is noted as one of the most cost effective medical interventions for providing beneficial child health.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; While there are considerable differences within developed and developing countries: income, employment, social norms, and access to healthcare were found to be universal determinants of whether a mother breast or formula fed their children.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;  Community based healthcare workers have helped alleviate financial barriers faced by newly made mothers, and provided a viable alternative to traditional and expensive hospital based medical care.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Recent studies based upon surveys conducted from 1995-2010 shows exclusive breastfeeding rates have gone up globally, from 33% to 39%.&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt; Despite the growth rates, medical professionals acknowledge the need for improvement given the importance of exclusive breastfeeding.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt;

===Global initiatives===
The [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations#Online campaign against hunger campaign|EndingHunger]] campaign is an online communication campaign aimed at raising awareness of the hunger problem. It has many worked through viral videos depicting celebrities voicing their anger about the large number of hungry people in the world.

Food security and global malnutrition has long been a topic of international concern, with one of the first official global documents addressing it being the 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]](UDHR). Within this document it stated that access to food was part of an adequate right to a standard of living.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/index.html|title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights|website=www.un.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-24|date=2015-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Right to food]] was asserted in the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]], a [[treaty]] adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on December 16, 1966. The Right to food is a [[human rights|human right]] for people to feed themselves in dignity, be free from hunger, food insecurity, and malnutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.righttofood.org/work-of-jean-ziegler-at-the-un/what-is-the-right-to-food/|title=What is the Right to Food? {{!}} Right to food|website=www.righttofood.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018, the treaty has been signed by 166 countries, by signing states agreed to take steps to the maximum of their available resources to achieve the right to adequate food.

However, after the 1966 International Covenant the global concern for the access to sufficient food only became more present, leading to the first ever World Food Conference that was held in 1974 in Rome, Italy. The [[Universal Declaration on the Eradication of Hunger and Malnutrition]] was a UN resolution adopted November 16, 1974 by all 135 countries that attended the 1974 World Food Conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/publications/universal-declaration-on-the-eradication-of-hunger-and-malnutrition.htm|title=Universal Declaration on the Eradication of Hunger and Malnutrition|language=en|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This non-legally binding document set forth certain aspirations for countries to follow to sufficiently take action on the global food problem. Ultimately this document outline and provided guidance as to how the international community as one could work towards fighting and solving the growing global issue of malnutrition and hunger.

Adoption of the right to food was included in the [[American Convention on Human Rights#Additional Protocols|Additional Protocol to the American Convention on Human Rights in the area of Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights]], this 1978 document was adopted by many countries in the Americas, the purpose of the document is, "to consolidate in this hemisphere, within the framework of democratic institutions, a system of personal liberty and [[social justice]] based on respect for the essential rights of man."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hrcr.org/docs/American_Convention/oashr.html|title=American Convention on Human Rights|website=www.hrcr.org|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next document in the timeline of global inititaves for malnutrition was the 1996 [[Rome Declaration on World Food Security]], organized by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]]. This document reaffirmed the right to have access to safe and nutritous food by everyone, also considering that everyone gets sufficient food, and set the goals for all nations to improve their commitment to food security by halfing their amount of undernourished people by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/w3613e/w3613e00.htm|title=Rome Declaration and Plan of Action|website=www.fao.org|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 the Food and Agriculture Organization adopted the  [[Right to Food Guidelines]], which offered states a framework of how to increase the right to food on a national basis.

In April 2012, the [[Food Assistance Convention]] was signed, the world's first legally binding international agreement on food aid. The May 2012 [[Copenhagen Consensus]] recommended that efforts to combat hunger and malnutrition should be the first priority for politicians and private sector philanthropists looking to maximize the effectiveness of aid spending. They put this ahead of other priorities, like the fight against [[malaria]] and [[AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/Projects/CC12/Outcome.aspx Outcome of the 2012 Copenhagen Consensus]&lt;/ref&gt;

The main global policy to reduce hunger and poverty are the [[Sustainable Development Goals]], approved through the UN in 2015. In particular Goal 2: Zero hunger sets globally agreed targets to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/hunger/ Description and targets for Goal 2 of the Sustainable Development Goals]&lt;/ref&gt; The partnership Compact2025, led by [[International Food Policy Research Institute|IFPRI]] with the involvement of UN organisations, NGOs and private foundations develops and disseminates evidence-based advice to politicians and other decision-makers aimed at ending hunger and undernutrition in the coming 10 years, by 2025.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ifpri.org/publication/compact-2025-ending-hunger-and-undernutrition Compact2025: Ending hunger and undernutrition. 2015.

In June 2015, the [[European Union]] and the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]] have launched a partnership to combat undernutrition especially in children. The program will initiatilly be implemented in Bangladesh, Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Laos and Niger and will help these countries to improve information and analysis about nutrition so they can develop effective national nutrition policies.&lt;ref&gt;European Commission Press release.

Accessed on 1 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the UN has created a partnership that will act through the [[African Union]]'s CAADP framework aiming to end hunger in Africa by 2025. It includes different interventions including support for improved food production, a strengthening of social protection and integration of the right to food into national legislation.&lt;ref&gt;FAO. 2015.

In response to child malnutrition, the [[Bangladesh|Bangladeshi government]] recommends ten steps for treating severe malnutrition. They are to prevent or treat [[dehydration]], [[hypoglycemia|low blood sugar]], [[hypothermia|low body temperature]], infection, correct electrolyte imbalances and micronutrient deficiencies, start feeding cautiously, achieve catch-up growth, provide psychological support, and prepare for discharge and follow-up after recovery.&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008" /&gt;

Among those who are hospitalized, nutritional support improves protein, calorie intake and weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bally|first1=MR|last2=Blaser Yildirim|first2=PZ|last3=Bounoure|first3=L|last4=Gloy|first4=VL|last5=Mueller|first5=B|last6=Briel|first6=M|last7=Schuetz|first7=P|date=January 1, 2016|title=Nutritional Support and Outcomes in Malnourished Medical Inpatients: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.|journal=JAMA Internal Medicine|volume=176|issue=1|pages=43–53|doi=10.1001/jamainternmed.2015.6587|pmid=26720894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In those who are severely malnourished, feeding too much too quickly can result in [[refeeding syndrome]].&lt;ref name="Via2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Viana Lde|first1=A|last2=Burgos|first2=MG|last3=Silva Rde|first3=A|date=Jan–Mar 2012|title=Refeeding syndrome: clinical and nutritional relevance.|journal=Arquivos Brasileiros de Cirurgia Digestiva : ABCD = Brazilian Archives of Digestive Surgery|volume=25|issue=1|pages=56–9|pmid=22569981}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can result regardless of route of feeding and can present itself a couple of days after eating with [[heart failure]], [[Cardiac dysrhythmia|dysrhythmia]]s and confusion that can result in death.&lt;ref name="Via2012" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boateng|first1=AA|last2=Sriram|first2=K|last3=Meguid|first3=MM|last4=Crook|first4=M|date=Feb 2010|title=Refeeding syndrome: treatment considerations based on collective analysis of literature case reports.|journal=Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)|volume=26|issue=2|pages=156–67|doi=10.1016/j.nut.2009.11.017|pmid=20122539}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manufacturers are trying to fortify everyday foods with micronutrients that can be sold to consumers such as wheat flour for Beladi bread in Egypt or fish sauce in Vietnam and the iodization of salt.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;

For example, flour has been fortified with iron, zinc, folic acid and other B vitamins such as thiamine, riboflavin, niacin and vitamin B12.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Micronutrients===
Treating malnutrition, mostly through [[food fortification|fortifying]] foods with micronutrients (vitamins and minerals), improves lives at a lower cost and shorter time than other forms of [[aid]], according to the World Bank.&lt;ref name="IQ"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/04/opinion/04kristof.html|title=Raising the world's IQ|last=Kristof|first=Nicholas D.|date=December 4, 2008|work=The New York Times|newspaper=|agency=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Copenhagen Consensus]], which look at a variety of development proposals, ranked micronutrient supplements as number one.&lt;ref name="hiddenhunger"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/24/opinion/24kristof.html|title=The Hidden Hunger|last=Kristof|first=Nicholas D.|date=May 24, 2009|work=|newspaper=New York Times|agency=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Let them eat micronutrients"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/160075|title=Let them eat micronutrients|work=|newspaper=Newsweek|agency=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In those with diarrhea, once an initial four-hour rehydration period is completed, zinc supplementation is recommended. Daily zinc increases the chances of reducing the severity and duration of the diarrhea, and continuing with daily zinc for ten to fourteen days makes diarrhea less likely recur in the next two to three months.&lt;ref name="WHO (2005)"&gt;[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2005/9241593180.pdf The Treatment of Diarrhoea: A manual for physicians and other senior health workers], World Health Organization, 2005.  See especially Ch. 4 "Management of Acute Diarrhoea (Without Blood)" and Ch. 8 "Management of Diarrhoea With Severe Malnutrition."&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, malnourished children need both potassium and magnesium.&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008"&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/bangladesh/SAM_Guideline.pdf National Guidelines for the Management of Severely Malnourished Children in Bangladesh], Institute of Public Health Nutrition, Directorate General of Health Services, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, May 2008, page 18 (19 in PDF) and following pages.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be obtained by following the above recommendations for the dehydrated child to continue eating within two to three hours of starting rehydration,&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO (2005)" /&gt; and including foods rich in potassium as above. [[Hypokalemia|Low blood potassium]] is worsened when base (as in Ringer's/Hartmann's) is given to treat acidosis without simultaneously providing potassium.&lt;ref name="WHO (2005)" /&gt; As above, available home products such as salted and unsalted cereal water, salted and unsalted vegetable broth can be given early during the course of a child's diarrhea along with continued eating.&lt;ref name="WHO (2005)" /&gt;  Vitamin A, potassium, magnesium, and zinc should be added with other vitamins and minerals if available.&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008" /&gt;

For a malnourished child with diarrhea from any cause, this should include foods rich in potassium such as bananas, green coconut water, and unsweetened fresh fruit juice.&lt;ref name="WHO (2005)" /&gt;

===Diarrhea===
[[File:ORT saches.JPG|thumb|Examples of commercially available oral rehydration salts (Nepal on left, Peru on right).]]
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends rehydrating a severely undernourished child who has diarrhea relatively slowly.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp8/&gt; --&gt; The preferred method is with fluids by mouth using a drink called [[oral rehydration solution]] (ORS).&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp8/&gt; --&gt; The oral rehydration solution is both slightly [[sweet]] and slightly [[salt]]y and the one recommended in those with severe undernutrition should have half the usual sodium and greater potassium.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp8/&gt; --&gt; Fluids by [[nasogastric tube]] may be use in those who do not drink.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp8/&gt; --&gt; [[Intravenous]] fluids are recommended only in those who have [[Shock (circulatory)|significant dehydration]] due to their potential complications.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp8/&gt; --&gt; These complications include [[congestive heart failure]].&lt;ref name="WHO2005Chp8" /&gt; Over time, ORS developed into [[Oral rehydration therapy|ORT]], or [[oral rehydration therapy]], which focused on increasing fluids by supplying salts, carbohydrates, and water. This switch from type of fluid to amount of fluid was crucial in order to prevent dehydration from diarrhea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Victora|first=Cesar|last2=Bryce|first2=Jennifer|date=Jan 2000|title=Reducing deaths from diarrhoea through oral rehydration therapy|url=http://www.scielosp.org/scielo.php?pid=S0042-96862000001000010&amp;script=sci_arttext&amp;tlng=e|journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization|volume=78|issue=10|pages=1246–1255|doi=10.1590/S0042-96862000001000010|pmid=|access-date=|doi-broken-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Breast feeding and eating should resume as soon as possible.&lt;ref name="WHO2005Chp8" /&gt; Drinks such as soft drinks, fruit juices, or sweetened teas are not recommended as they contain too much sugar and may worsen diarrhea.&lt;ref name="WHO2005Chp4"&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2005/9241593180.pdf|title=The Treatment of diarrhoea : a manual for physicians and other senior health  workers.|date=2005|publisher=World Health Organization|isbn=924159318 0|edition=4|location=Geneva|pages=8–16|chapter=4. Management of acute diarrhoea without blood}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Broad spectrum antibiotic]]s are recommended in all severely undernourished children with diarrhea requiring admission to hospital.&lt;ref name="WHO2005Chp8" /&gt;

To prevent dehydration readily available fluids, preferably with a modest amount of sugars and salt such as vegetable broth or salted rice water, may be used.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp4/&gt; --&gt; The drinking of additional clean water is also recommended.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp4/&gt; --&gt; Once dehydration develops oral rehydration solutions are preferred.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp4/&gt; --&gt; As much of these drinks as the person wants can be given, unless there are signs of swelling.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp4/&gt; --&gt; If vomiting occurs, fluids can be paused for 5–10 minutes and then restarting more slowly.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp4/&gt; --&gt; Vomiting rarely prevents rehydration as fluid are still absorbed and the vomiting rarely last long.&lt;ref name="WHO2005Chp4" /&gt; A severely malnourished child with what appears to be dehydration but who has not had diarrhea should be treated as if they have an infection.&lt;ref name="WHO2005Chp8" /&gt;

For babies a dropper or syringe without the needle can be used to put small amounts of fluid into the mouth; for children under 2, a teaspoon every one to two minutes; and for older children and adults, frequent sips directly from a cup.&lt;ref name="WHO (2005)" /&gt; After the first two hours, rehydration should be continued at the same or slower rate, determined by how much fluid the child wants and any ongoing diarrheal loses. After the first two hours of rehydration it is recommended that to alternate between rehydration and food.&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008" /&gt;

In 2003, WHO and UNICEF recommended a reduced-[[osmolarity]] ORS which still treats dehydration but also reduced stool volume and vomiting. Reduced-osmolarity ORS is the current standard ORS with reasonably wide availability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Js4950e/2.4.html WHO Drug Information Vol. 16, No. 2, 2002.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://rehydrate.org/ors/low-osmolarity-ors.htm Low-osmolarity oral rehydration solution (ORS)], Rehydrate Project, updated: April 23, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; For general use, one packet of ORS (glucose sugar, salt, potassium chloride, and trisodium citrate) is added to one liter of water; however, for malnourished children it is recommended that one packet of ORS be added to two liters of water along with an extra 50 grams of sucrose sugar and some stock potassium solution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2005/9241593180.pdf The Treatment of Diarrhoea: A manual for physicians and other senior health workers], WHO, 2005.  Specifically, 45 milliliters of potassium chloride solution from a stock solution containing 100g KCl per liter, along with one packet of ORS, ''&lt;u&gt;two&lt;/u&gt;'' liters of water, and 50 grams of sucrose.  And please remember, sucrose has approximately twice the molecular weight of glucose, with one mole of glucose weighing 180 g and one mole of sucrose weighing 342 g.&lt;/ref&gt;

Malnourished children have an excess of body sodium.&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008" /&gt;  Recommendations for home remedies agree with one liter of water (34 oz.) and 6 teaspoons sugar and disagree regarding whether it is then one teaspoon of salt added or only 1/2, with perhaps most sources recommending 1/2 teaspoon of added salt to one liter water.&lt;ref name="WHO (2005)" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2005/9241592330.pdf "Guidelines for the control of shigellosis, including epidemics due to Shigella dysenteriae type 1".] World Health Organization, 2005, Annex 12 - Preparation of Home Made Oral Rehydration Solution, page 51 (57 in PDF): "Ingredients: Half a teaspoon of salt (2.5 grams), six level teaspoons of sugar (30 grams) and one litre of safe drinking water".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dehydration/basics/treatment/con-20030056 "Dehydration, treatments and drugs."] Mayo Clinic January 7, 2011.

===Low blood sugar===
[[Hypoglycemia]], whether known or suspected, can be treated with a mixture of sugar and water. If the child is conscious, the initial dose of sugar and water can be given by mouth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/bangladesh/SAM_Guideline.pdf National Guidelines for the Management of Severely Malnourished Children in Bangladesh] recommends, for initial hypoglycemia, a 50 milliliter bolus of 10% glucose or sucrose.  This can also be achieved by added 1 rounded teaspoon of sugar to 10.5 teaspoons of water (which is 3.5 tablespoons of water).&lt;/ref&gt; If the child is unconscious, give glucose by [[intravenous]] or [[nasogastric tube]]. If seizures occur after despite glucose, rectal [[diazepam]] is recommended. Blood sugar levels should be re-checked on two hour intervals.&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008" /&gt;

===Hypothermia===
[[Hypothermia]] can occur. To prevent or treat this, the child can be kept warm with covering including of the head or by direct skin-to-skin contact with the mother or father and then covering both parent and child. Prolonged bathing or prolonged medical exams should be avoided. Warming methods are usually most important at night.&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008" /&gt;

The figures provided in this section on epidemiology all refer to ''undernutrition'' even if the term malnutrition is used which, by definition, could also apply to too much nutrition.

The [[Global Hunger Index]] (GHI) is a multidimensional statistical tool used to describe the state of countries’ hunger situation. The GHI measures progress and failures in the global fight against hunger.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news| url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8306556.stm |title= Global hunger worsening, warns UN |publisher= BBC (Europe) |date= 14 October 2009 |accessdate=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GHI is updated once a year. The data from the 2015 report shows that Hunger levels have dropped 27% since 2000. Fifty two countries remain at serious or alarming levels. In addition to the latest statistics on Hunger and Food Security, the GHI also features different special topics each year. The 2015 report include an article on conflict and food security.&lt;ref&gt;K. von Grebmer, J. Bernstein, A. de Waal, N. Prasai, S. Yin, Y.

==History ==
Throughout history, portions of the world's population have often experienced sustained periods of hunger. In many cases, this resulted from food supply disruptions caused by war, plagues, or adverse weather. For the first few decades after [[World War II]], technological progress and enhanced political cooperation suggested it might be possible to substantially reduce the number of people suffering from hunger. While progress was uneven, by 2000 the threat of extreme hunger subsided for many of the world's people. According to the WFP some statistics are that, "Some 795 million people in the world do not have enough food to lead a healthy active life. That's about one in nine people on earth. The vast majority of the world's hungry people live in developing countries, where 12.9 percent of the population is undernourished."&lt;ref name="wfp.org Hunger Statistics"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hunger Statistics|url=https://www.wfp.org/hunger/stats|website=World Food Programme|publisher=wfp.org|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 2006, the average international price of food had been largely stable for several decades. In the closing months of 2006, however, prices began to [[2007–2008 world food price crisis|rise rapidly]]. By 2008, rice had tripled in price in some regions, and this severely affected [[developing countries]]. Food prices fell in early 2009, but rose to another record high in 2011, and have since decreased slightly. The [[financial crisis of 2007–2012|2008 worldwide financial crisis]] further increased the number of people suffering from hunger, including dramatic increases even in advanced economies such as [[Great Britain]], the [[Eurozone]] and the [[United States]].

The [[Millennium Development Goals]] included a commitment to a further 50% reduction in the proportion of the world's population who have extreme hunger by 2015. As of 2012, this target appeared difficult to achieve, due in part to persistent inflation in food prices. However, in late 2012 the UN's [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) stated it is still possible to hit the target with sufficient effort. In 2013, the ''FAO'' estimated that 842 million people are undernourished (12% of the global population). Malnutrition is a cause of death for more than 3.1 million children under 5 every year. [[UNICEF]] estimates 300 million children go to bed hungry each night; and that 8000 children under the age of 5 are estimated to die of malnutrition every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/rightsite/364_617.htm|author=Ernest C. Madu|title=Investment and Development Will Secure the Rights of the Child}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century and earlier===
Throughout history, the need to aid those suffering from hunger has been commonly, though not universally,&lt;ref&gt;As an example of historical opposition to food aid, during the [[Hungry Forties]], English [[Laissez-faire]] advocates were largely successful in preventing it being deployed by Great Britain to relief the Irish famine; see for example the section on "Ideology and relief"' in Chpt. 2 of ''The Great Irish Famine'' by [[Cormac Ó Gráda]].

For a detailed description of how views opposed to hunger relief became dominant within Great Britain's policy making circles during the 19th century, and also their subsequent displacement, see ''Hunger: A Modern History'' (2007) by James Vernon, esp. Chpts. 1–3. In 2012, advocates of small government spoke out against the US food stamp programme, saying it discourages people from fending for themselves, in the same way as it is not always a good idea to feed hungry wild animals. ( See [http://www.star-telegram.com/2012/07/14/4099922/food-stamp-debate-brings-out-the.html Food stamp debate brings out the haters] published by the ''Star Telegram''. )&lt;/ref&gt; recognized.

The philosopher [[Simone Weil]] wrote that feeding the hungry when you have resources to do so is the most obvious of all human [[Moral obligation|obligations]]. She says that as far back as [[Ancient Egypt]], many believed that people had to show they had helped the hungry in order to justify themselves in the afterlife. Weil writes that [[Social progress]] is commonly held to be first of all, "...a transition to a state of human society in which people will not suffer from hunger." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Simone Weil]]|title=The Need for Roots|page = 6|year=2002 |orig-year= 1942|isbn=978-0-415-27102-8|publisher = [[Routledge]]|title-link=The Need for Roots}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Social historian [[Karl Polanyi]] wrote that before markets became the world's dominant form of economic organization in the 19th century, most human societies would either starve all together or not at all, because communities would invariably share their food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = [[Karl Polanyi]] | title = The Great Transformation | year = 2002 |orig-year=1942 | chapter = chpt. 4  | isbn = 978-0-8070-5643-1  | publisher=Beacon Press | title-link = The Great Transformation (book) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the first age of globalization, which began in the 19th century, it became more common for people to consider problems like hunger in global terms. However, as early globalization largely coincided with the high peak of influence for [[classical liberalism]], there was relatively little call for politicians to address world hunger.&lt;ref&gt;For further info see [[Hunger in the United Kingdom#Attitudes towards hunger relief]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;There were many exceptions. For example, in ''Hunger: A Modern History'' (2007), James Vernon describes dozens of 18th and 19th century campaigners who spoke in favor of hunger relief.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, the view that politicians ought not to intervene against hunger was increasingly challenged by campaigning journalists, with some academics and politicians also calling for or organizing intervention against world hunger, such as U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]].&lt;ref name = "HungerModHist"&gt;{{cite book |author = James Vernon|title=Hunger: A Modern History |chapter = Chpts. 1-3|year= 2007|isbn=978-0674026780 |publisher= [[Harvard University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grigg"&gt;{{cite journal|author = David Grigg|title=The historiography of hunger: changing views on the world food problem 1945–1980|journal=Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers|year= 1981

===Great Depression===
[[File:Unemployed men queued outside a depression soup kitchen opened in Chicago by Al Capone, 02-1931 - NARA - 541927.jpg|thumb|210px|Unemployed men outside a soup kitchen in Chicago, 1931|upright=1.15]]
Hunger as an academic and social topic came to prominence during the [[Great Depression]]. As many individuals struggled for food, the same agricultural industries were suddenly producing large surpluses as means of increased production to counter the drop in demand from the European markets. This increased output was meant to ease the growing debt levels, however domestic demand could not keep up with prices. Instead, what is often called "the paradox of want amid plenty," agricultural surpluses and large demand simply did not fit together, causing the Hoover administration to buy large amounts of product, such as grain, to stabilize prices. Initially refusing to further compromise the distressed price levels, political pressure from starving families across the country forced Congress to reconsider. With large deposits of grain already wasting away in government possession, the only political move left was to begin a process of donations to the hungry from the Farm Board, a federal oversight created in 1929 to promote the sale and stabilization of agricultural products. Instead of hunger being a reason for the allocation of large grain surpluses, waste became the eventual driving force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = Janet Poppendieck | title = Eating Agendas | year = 1995 | isbn = 978-0-202-30508-0 | publisher=Aldine Transaction }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After World War II===
[[File:Civil Rights March on Washington, D.C. (Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Mathew Ahmann in a crowd.) - NARA - 542015 - Restoration.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Martin Luther King]] (center), one of many twentieth century political figures who considered it important to fight hunger: "When I die, don't build a monument to me. Don't bestow me degrees from great universities. Just clothe the naked. Say that I tried to house the homeless. Let people say that I tried to feed the hungry." &lt;ref name = "foodAndFamine"/&gt;]]
After World War II, a new international politico-economic order came into being, which was later described as [[Embedded liberalism]].

For at least the first decade after the war, the United States, by far the period's most dominant national actor, was strongly supportive of efforts to tackle world hunger and to promote international development. It heavily funded the United Nation's development programmes, and later the efforts of other multilateral organizations like the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and the [[World Bank]] (WB).&lt;ref name="Grigg"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "foodAndFamine"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Politics of hunger"&gt;{{cite book |author = John R. Butterly and Jack Shepherd |title=Hunger: The Biology and Politics of Starvation|year= 2010|isbn=978-1584659266 |publisher= Dartmouth College}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The newly established United Nations became a leading player in co-ordinating the global fight against hunger. The UN has three agencies that work to promote food security and agricultural development: the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the [[World Food Programme]] (WFP) and the [[International Fund for Agricultural Development]] (IFAD). FAO is the world's agricultural knowledge agency, providing policy and technical assistance to developing countries to promote food security, nutrition and sustainable agricultural production, particularly in rural areas.

WFP's key mission is to deliver food into the hands of the hungry poor. The agency steps in during [[emergencies]] and uses food to aid recovery after emergencies. Its longer term approaches to hunger helps the transition from recovery to development. IFAD, with its knowledge of rural poverty and exclusive focus on poor rural people, designs and implements programmes to help those people access the assets, services and opportunities they need to overcome poverty.&lt;ref name="Grigg"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "foodAndFamine"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Politics of hunger"/&gt;

Following successful post WWII reconstruction of Germany and Japan, the IMF and WB began to turn their attention to the developing world. A great many [[NGO|civil society actors]] were also active in trying to combat hunger, especially after the late 1970s when global media began to bring the plight of starving people in places like [[Ethiopia]] to wider attention.  Most significant of all, especially in the late 1960s and 70s, the [[Green revolution]] helped improved agricultural technology propagate throughout the world.&lt;ref name="Grigg"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "foodAndFamine"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Politics of hunger"/&gt;

The United States began to change its approach to the problem of world hunger from about the mid 1950s. Influential members of the administration became less enthusiastic about methods they saw as promoting an over reliance on the state, as they feared that might assist the spread of communism. Despite this view, during the 1960s postwar era hunger within the United States was overshadowed by hunger in Europe and Asia. John F. Kennedy did in fact use Executive Order to double the amount of commodities available from the surplus commodity program as well as initiated the pilot Food Stamp Program which later became permanent in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maurer|first1=Donna|last2=Poppendieck|first2=Janet|title=Eating agendas : food and nutrition as social problems|date=1995|publisher=Aldine de Gruyter|location=New York|isbn=9780202305073|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s===
By the 1980s, the previous consensus in favour of moderate government intervention had been [[Post-war displacement of Keynesianism|displaced across the western world.]] The IMF and World Bank in particular began to promote market-based solutions. In cases where countries became dependent on the IMF, they sometimes forced national governments to prioritize debt repayments and sharply cut public services. This sometimes had a negative effect on efforts to combat hunger.&lt;ref name="Ecologist-2014-04-03"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MR-2013-11-Magdoff"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MRzine-2012-12-Goswami"/&gt;
[[File:Irrigation1.jpg|thumb|left|Increased use of irrigation played a major role in the [[Green Revolution]].]]
Organizations such as [[Food First]] raised the issue of [[food sovereignty]] and claimed that every country on earth (with the possible minor exceptions of some city-states) has sufficient agricultural capacity to feed its own people, but that the "[[free trade]]" economic order, which from the late 1970s to about 2008 had been associated with such institutions as the IMF and World Bank, had prevented this from happening.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The World Bank itself claimed it was part of the solution to hunger, asserting that the best way for countries to break the cycle of poverty and hunger was to build export-led economies that provide the financial means to buy foodstuffs on the world market. However, in the early 21st century the World Bank and IMF became less dogmatic about promoting [[free market]] reforms. They increasingly returned to the view that government intervention does have a role to play, and that it can be advisable for governments to support food security with policies favourable to domestic agriculture, even for countries that do not have a [[Comparative advantage]] in that area. As of 2012, the World Bank remains active in helping governments to intervene against hunger.&lt;ref name ="WB30Jul12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/2012/07/30/food-price-volatility-growing-concern-world-bank-stands-ready-respond|title=Food Price Volatility a Growing Concern, World Bank Stands Ready to Respond|publisher= [[World Bank]]|date=30 March 2012|accessdate=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grigg"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "foodAndFamine"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Politics of hunger"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Until at least the 1980s—and, to an extent, the 1990s—the dominant academic view concerning world hunger was that it was a problem of demand exceeding supply. Proposed solutions often focused on boosting food production, and sometimes on birth control. There were exceptions to this, even as early as the 1940s, [[John Boyd Orr, 1st Baron Boyd-Orr|Lord Boyd-Orr]], the first head of the UN's FAO, had perceived hunger as largely a problem of distribution, and drew up comprehensive plans to correct this. Few agreed with him at the time, however, and he resigned after failing to secure support for his plans from the US and Great Britain. In 1998, [[Amartya Sen]] won a [[Nobel Prize]] in part for demonstrating that hunger in modern times is not typically the product of a lack of food. Rather, hunger usually arises from food distribution problems, or from governmental policies in the developed and developing world. It has since been broadly accepted that world hunger results from issues with the distribution as well as the production of food.&lt;ref name="Ecologist-2014-04-03"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MR-2013-11-Magdoff"&gt;[[Harry Magdoff#Death|Fred Magdoff]], [https://monthlyreview.org/2013/11/01/twenty-first-century-land-grabs Twenty-First-Century Land Grabs - Accumulation by Agricultural Dispossession], ''[[Monthly Review]]'', 2013, Volume 65, Issue 06 (November)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MRzine-2012-12-Goswami"&gt;Rahul Goswami, [http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/2012/goswami041212.html For Whom Do the FAO and Its Director-General Work?], ''[[Monthly Review|Monthly Review Magazine]]'', 2012.12.04&lt;/ref&gt;  Sen's 1981 essay ''Poverty and Famines: An Essay on Entitlement and Deprivation'' played a prominent part in forging the new consensus.&lt;ref name="foodAndFamine" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor= John Baylis, Steve Smith and Patricia Owens |author = Caroline Thomas and Tony Evans|title=The Globalization of World Politics|chapter = "Poverty, development and hunger"|year= 2010|isbn=978-0199569090 |publisher= [[Oxford University press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s===

In 2007 and 2008, rapidly increasing food prices caused a ''global food crisis'', increasing the numbers suffering from hunger by over a hundred million. [[Food riot]]s erupted in several dozen countries; in at least two cases, [[Haiti]] and [[Madagascar]], this led to the toppling of governments. A second ''global food crisis'' unfolded due to the spike in food prices of late 2010 and early 2011. Fewer food riots occurred, due in part to greater availability of food stock piles for relief. However, several analysts argue the food crisis was one of the causes of the [[Arab Spring]].&lt;ref name="Politics of hunger" /&gt;&lt;ref name="G202012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brics"&gt;{{cite news|

As of 2008 roughly $300 million of aid went to basic nutrition each year, less than $2 for each child below two in the 20 worst affected countries.&lt;ref name=economist/&gt; In contrast, at that time [[AIDS|HIV/AIDS]], which caused fewer deaths than child malnutrition, received $2.2 billion—$67 per person with HIV in all countries.&lt;ref name=economist/&gt; In 2008 UN estimated that ending world hunger could cost about 30 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/04/news/04iht-04food.13446176.html|title=UN says solving food crisis could cost $30 billion|first=Elisabeth Rosenthal and Andrew|last=Martin|date=2008-06-04|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics]] ([[ICRISAT]]), a member of the [[CGIAR]] consortium, partners with farmers, governments, researchers and NGOs to help farmers grow nutritious crops, such as [[chickpea]], [[groundnut]], [[pigeonpea]], [[millet]] and [[sorghum]]. This helps their communities have more balanced diets and become more resilient to pests and drought. The Harnessing Opportunities for Productivity Enhancement of Sorghum and Millets in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Indian-Subcontinent (HOPE) project, for example, is increasing yields of [[eleusine coracana|finger millet]] in [[Tanzania]] by encouraging farmers to grow improved varieties. Finger millet is very high in calcium, rich in iron and fiber, and has a better energy content than other cereals. These characteristics make it ideal for feeding to infants and the elderly.&lt;ref&gt;Alina Paul Bossuet, ''Nourishing Communities Through Holistic Farming'' {{cite web|url=http://exploreit.icrisat.org/page/sorghum/882/249 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 26, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402123923/http://exploreit.icrisat.org/page/sorghum/882/249 |archivedate=April 2, 2015 |df= }}.

Some organizations have begun working with teachers, policymakers, and managed food service contractors to mandate improved nutritional content and increased nutritional resources in school cafeterias from primary to university-level institutions.

In the early 21st century, there was relatively little awareness of hunger from leaders of advanced nations such as those that form the [[G8]].&lt;ref name="G202012"/&gt; Prior to 2009, efforts to fight hunger were mainly undertaken by governments of the worst affected countries, by civil society actors, and by multilateral and regional organizations. In 2009, Pope Benedict published his third encyclical, [[Caritas in Veritate]], which emphasised the importance of fighting against hunger. The encyclical was intentionally published immediately before the [[35th G8 summit|July 2009 G8 Summit]] to maximise its influence on that event. At the Summit, which took place at [[L'Aquila]] in central Italy, the ''L'Aquila Food Security Initiative'' was launched, with a total of US$22 billion committed to combat hunger.&lt;ref&gt;

Food prices did fall sharply in 2009 and early 2010, though analysts credit this much more to farmers increasing production in response to the 2008 spike in prices, than to the fruits of enhanced government action. However, since the 2009 G8 summit, the fight against hunger has remained a high-profile issue among the leaders of the worlds major nations, and was a prominent part of the agenda for the [[2012 G-20 Mexico summit|2012 G-20 summit]].&lt;ref name="G202012"&gt;

In April 2012, the [[Food Assistance Convention]] was signed, the world's first legally binding international agreement on food aid. The May 2012 [[Copenhagen Consensus]] recommended that efforts to combat hunger and malnutrition should be the first priority for politicians and private sector philanthropists looking to maximize the effectiveness of aid spending. They put this ahead of other priorities, like the fight against [[malaria]] and [[AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/Projects/CC12/Outcome.aspx|title=Outcome - Copenhagen Consensus Center|website=www.copenhagenconsensus.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in May 2012, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] launched a "new alliance for food security and nutrition"—a broad partnership between private sector, governmental and civil society actors—that aimed to "...achieve sustained and inclusive agricultural growth and raise 50 million people out of poverty over the next 10 years."&lt;ref name="Ecologist-2014-04-03"&gt;[http://www.theecologist.org/News/news_analysis/2343978/uk_aid_is_financing_a_corporate_scramble_for_africa.html UK 'aid' is financing a corporate scramble for Africa], Miriam Ross, ''[[The Ecologist]]'', 2014.04.03&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "2012G8"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/s/globalfoodsecurity/190282.htm G8 Action on Food Security and Nutrition] 2012 statement hosted by the US Department of State&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/05/18/remarks-president-symposium-global-agriculture-and-food-security Remarks by President concerning the launch of the ''new alliance for food security and nutrition'']&lt;/ref&gt; The UK's prime minister [[David Cameron]] held a [[2012 Olympic hunger summit|hunger summit]] on 12 August, the last day of the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref name="2012G8"/&gt;

The fight against hunger has also been joined by an increased number of regular people. While folk throughout the world had long contributed to efforts to alleviate hunger in the developing world, there has recently been a rapid increase in the numbers involved in tackling domestic hunger even within the economically advanced nations of the [[Global North]].

This had happened much earlier in North America than it did in Europe. In the US, the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration scaled back welfare the early 1980s, leading to a vast increase of charity sector efforts to help Americans unable to buy enough to eat. According to a 1992 survey of 1000 randomly selected US voters, 77% of Americans had contributed to efforts to feed the hungry, either by volunteering for various hunger relief agencies such as [[food banks]] and [[soup kitchen]]s, or by donating cash or food.&lt;ref&gt;

Europe, with its more generous welfare system, had little awareness of domestic hunger until the food price inflation that began in late 2006, and especially as austerity-imposed welfare cuts began to take effect in 2010. Various surveys reported that upwards of 10% of Europe's population had begun to suffer from food insecurity.

By July 2012, the [[2012 US drought]] had already caused a rapid increase in the price of grain and soy, with a knock on effect on the price of meat. As well as affecting hungry people in the US, this caused prices to rise on the global markets; the US is the world's biggest exporter of food. This led to much talk of a possible third 21st century global food crisis. The ''Financial Times'' reported that the [[BRICS]] may not be as badly affected as they were in the earlier crises of 2008 and 2011. However, smaller developing countries that must import a substantial portion of their food could be hard hit. The UN and [[G20]] has begun contingency planning so as to be ready to intervene if a third global crisis breaks out.&lt;ref name ="WB30Jul12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brics"/&gt;&lt;ref name="US drought"&gt;

Undernutrition is an important determinant of maternal and child health, accounting for more than a third of child deaths and more than 10 percent of the total global [[disease burden]] according to 2008 studies.&lt;ref name="Black2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Black | first1 = R.

World Health Organization (WHO), Geneva, Switzerland&lt;/ref&gt;

As underweight children are more vulnerable to almost all infectious diseases, the ''indirect'' disease burden of malnutrition is estimated to be an order of magnitude higher than the disease burden of the ''direct'' effects of malnutrition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The combination of direct and indirect deaths from malnutrition caused by unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene ([[WASH]]) practices is estimated to lead to 860,000 deaths per year in children under five years of age.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Women===

{{main article|Food security#Gender and food security}}
[[File:Lange-MigrantMother02.jpg|thumb|''[[Migrant Mother]]'' by [[Dorothea Lange]] (1936).]]
Older sources sometimes claim this phenomenon is unique to developing countries, due to greater sexual inequality. More recent findings suggested that mothers often miss meals in advanced economies too. For example, a 2012 study undertaken by [[Netmums]] in the UK found that one in five mothers sometimes misses out on food to save their children from hunger.&lt;ref name ="WB30Jul12"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.wdm.org.uk/food-and-hunger/555-million-women-go-hungry-worldwide

In several periods and regions, gender has also been an important factor determining whether or not victims of hunger would make suitable examples for generating enthusiasm for hunger relief efforts. James Vernon, in his ''Hunger: A Modern History'', wrote that in Britain before the 20th century, it was generally only women and children suffering from hunger who could arouse compassion. Men who failed to provide for themselves and their families were often regarded with contempt. This changed after [[World War I]], where thousands of men who had proved their manliness in combat found themselves unable to secure employment. Similarly, female gender could be advantageous for those wishing to advocate for hunger relief, with Vernon writing that being a woman helped [[Emily Hobhouse]] draw the plight of hungry people to wider attention during the [[Second Boer War]].&lt;ref name = "HungerModHist"/&gt;
[[File:Starved_girl.jpg|thumb|183x183px|Starved girl]]

Researchers from the Centre for World Food Studies in 2003 found that the gap between levels of undernutrition in men and women is generally small, but that the gap varies from region to region and from country to country.&lt;ref name="Nube 2003" /&gt; These small-scale studies showed that female undernutrition prevalence rates exceeded male undernutrition prevalence rates in South/Southeast Asia and Latin America and were lower in Sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref name="Nube 2003" /&gt; Datasets for Ethiopia and Zimbabwe reported undernutrition rates between 1.5 and 2 times higher in men than in women; however, in India and Pakistan, datasets rates of undernutrition were 1.5-2 times higher in women than in men. Intra-country variation also occurs, with frequent high gaps between regional undernutrition rates.&lt;ref name="Nube 2003"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nubé | first1 = M. | last2 = Van Den Boom | first2 = G.

Studies on nutrition concerning gender bias within households look at patterns of food allocation, and one study from 2003 suggested that women often receive a lower share of food requirements than men.&lt;ref name="Nube 2003" /&gt; Gender discrimination, gender roles, and social norms affecting women can lead to early marriage and childbearing, close birth spacing, and undernutrition, all of which contribute to malnourished mothers.&lt;ref name="Factors in Bangladesh" /&gt;

Within the household, there may be differences in levels of malnutrition between men and women, and these differences have been shown to vary significantly from one region to another, with problem areas showing relative deprivation of women.&lt;ref name="Nube 2003" /&gt; Samples of 1000 women in India in 2008 demonstrated that malnutrition in women is associated with poverty, lack of development and awareness, and illiteracy.&lt;ref name="Women 2008" /&gt; The same study showed that gender discrimination in households can prevent a woman's access to sufficient food and healthcare.&lt;ref name="Women 2008" /&gt; How socialization affects the health of women in Bangladesh, Najma Rivzi explains in an article about a research program on this topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Najma Rizvi |publisher=dandc.eu |title=Enduring misery |date=March 2013 |url=http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/bangladesh-does-not-guarantee-food-security-demanded-its-constitution}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, such as in parts of Kenya in 2006, rates of malnutrition in pregnant women were even higher than rates in children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carter|first=Rachel Bonham|title=Survey Reveals High Malnutrition Rates Among Pregnant Women in Kenya|url=http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/kenya_33782.html|publisher=UNICEF |accessdate=March 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women in some societies are traditionally given less food than men since men are perceived to have heavier workloads.&lt;ref name="Gender and Nutrition 2001" /&gt;  Household chores and agricultural tasks can in fact be very arduous and require additional energy and nutrients; however, physical activity, which largely determines energy requirements, is difficult to estimate.&lt;ref name="Nube 2003" /&gt;

====Physiology====
Women have unique nutritional requirements, and in some cases need more nutrients than men; for example, women need twice as much calcium as men.&lt;ref name="Gender and Nutrition 2001"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gender and Nutrition 2001|url=https://www.uthfa.com/gender-nutrition-2001/|publisher=Food and Agriculture of the United Nations |accessdate=August 22, 2016|date=July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pregnancy and breastfeeding====
During pregnancy and breastfeeding, women must ingest enough nutrients for themselves and their child, so they need significantly more protein and calories during these periods, as well as more vitamins and minerals (especially iron, iodine, calcium, folic acid, and vitamins A, C, and K).&lt;ref name="Gender and Nutrition 2001" /&gt; In 2001 the FAO of the UN reported that iron deficiency afflicted 43 percent of women in [[developing countries]] and increased the risk of death during childbirth.&lt;ref name="Gender and Nutrition 2001" /&gt; A 2008 review of interventions estimated that universal supplementation with calcium, iron, and folic acid during pregnancy could prevent 105,000 maternal deaths (23.6 percent of all maternal deaths).&lt;ref name="Bhutta 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bhutta | first1 = Z.

Frequent pregnancies with short intervals between them and long periods of breastfeeding add an additional nutritional burden.&lt;ref name="Nube 2003" /&gt;

====Educating children====
According to the FAO, women are often responsible for preparing food and have the chance to educate their children about beneficial food and health habits, giving mothers another chance to improve the nutrition of their children.&lt;ref name="Gender and Nutrition 2001" /&gt;

'''New constitutionalism''' is derived from the classical [[Neoliberalism|neo-liberalism]] framework and represents a set of political policies that promote a new global order.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dierckx|first=Sacha|date=2013-12-01|title=After the Crisis and Beyond the New Constitutionalism?

Central ideas of neoliberalism have been advanced to create policies and practices to achieve [[global governance]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  New constitutionalism provides power to the private realm and limits power of state governance and public corporations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The transferring of power creates an informal self-regulatory setting allowing for the dismissal of public scrutiny and transparency.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=New Constitutionalism and World Order|last=Gill|first=Stephen|last2=Cutler|first2=Claire|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2014|isbn=978-1-107-05369-4|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom; New York, NY|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  New constitutionalism has reshaped the structure of control to allow “locking in” mechanisms to occur to prevent intervention from the democratic realm and to enhance economic objectives.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  This protects markets from regional interference and allows global influence in order to promote [[imperialism]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The New Constitutionalism: International and Private Rule in The New Global Order|last=McBride|first=Stephen|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4426-0365-3|editor-last=McBride|editor-first=Stephen|location=Toronto|pages=21|editor-last2=Teeple|editor-first2=Gary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of new constitutionalism is the result of [[globalization]] and the growing need for [[global hegemony]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Institutions have gained power in regards to trade, mobility, and flexibility through the framework of new constitutionalism.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  The [[World Trade Organization]], [[International Monetary Fund]], the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]], and the [[European Union]] are all actors contributing to the power of global supremacy.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

New constitutionalism as a political order emerged in the latter half of the 20th century and the term was coined by academic[[Stephen Gill (political scientist)|Stephen Gill]].&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;  The need for economic constitutional change was the result of crisis in political order correspondingly to the [[Russian Revolution]] and the [[Cold War]] as well as the progress of [[globalization]] through technological means.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Since then the disciplinary has grown in acceptance due to the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|global financial crisis]] of 2007 and the need for largescale stabilization in its aftermath.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Theorists have subsequently developed the social and economic practices both in support and disagreement of the framework to provide a comparative outlook.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hilbink|first=Lisa|year=2008|title=Assessing the New Constitutionalism|url=https://www.jstor.org.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/stable/20434076?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents|journal=Comparative Politics|volume=40 [2]|pages=227–245|issn=0010-4159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
New constitutionalism formed in the 1980s as the result of a growing world order and the “worldwide market revolution.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The end of the [[Cold War]] represented an ideological shift and the need for transformation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  This shift was reiterated by [[Margaret Thatcher|Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher]] declaring the depletion of [[socialism]] and the rise of [[conservatism]] and [[liberalism]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  As society progressed it allowed for the evolution of capital mobility, [[Multinational corporation|transnational corporation]] and the expansion of the world market.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The [[Great Depression]] and the aftermath of [[World War II]] reflected the need for reform.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Reform would redirect economic and political practices, ensuring benefits for all through the creation of global institutions.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Falk, R. (2014). New Constitutionalism and geopolitics: notes on legality and legitimacy and prospects for a just new constitutionalism. Edited by ''Cutler, A., &amp; Gill, S.'' ''In New constitutionalism and world order.'' Cambridge, United Kingdom; New York, NY: Cambridge University Press, 295-312. {{ISBN|978-1-107-05369-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Neo-liberal supremacy through the dominance of the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] allowed for geopolitical reconfiguration increasing the need for new political order.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Additionally the lack of consistency among nation-state principles and the constant interruption from democratic power influenced the need to provide sustainable long term economic goals by limiting [[Executive (government)|executive]] and [[Legislature|legislative]] branches of government using [[Constitution|constitutional framework]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Cutler, A. Claire. (2016) "Transformations in Statehood, the Investor-State Regime, and the New Constitutionalism." ''Indiana Journal of Global Legal Studies'' 23, no. 1: 95-125.&lt;/ref&gt; New constitutionalism has become prominent in the aftermath of the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|2007 global financial crisis]] as a result of the need to bypass formal trade rules and democratic controls.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schneiderman, D. (2014).  How to govern differently: neo-liberal, new constitutionalism and international investment law. Edited by ''Cutler, A., &amp; Gill, S.'' ''In New constitutionalism and world order.'' Cambridge, United Kingdom; New York, NY: Cambridge University Press, 159-175. {{ISBN|978-1-107-05369-4}}.
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Framework ==
There are four main [[Policy|policies]] to define new constitutionalism.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The first represents the development of a constitutional structure for the global market that dictates the public, private and international powers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These international economic agreements or “[[constitution]]s” resemble political constitutions and thus ensure [[sovereignty]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The economic power is being shifted from the national to the international as well as from the public to the private to provide growth and sustainability.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Second is the separation of economic policies from domestic influence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  This allows for capitalist markets to grow as well as extending the commodity form and the market forces.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;''' ''' This separation insulates economic policies from governing regulatory powers as well as the public demand for transparency.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  [[Economic Liberation Movement|Economic liberation]] is usually accompanied by political backlash, by disconnecting these two dynamisms suppresses democratic involvement.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  [[World Bank Group|The World Bank]] advocates for the restriction of democratic participation and limitations imposed in the economic realm by creating a hierarchical system of representation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Thirdly is creating “locking in” mechanisms which incorporate; laws, rules, regulations, procedures and institutions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  This mechanism puts limitations on legislative and policy autonomy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Agreements are formulated to “lock in” [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] content through legal guarantees and sanctions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  These agreements are difficult, even impossible to change which makes economic policies autonomous.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Lastly this process diminished the need for formal accountability.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  New constitutionalism has created a flexible system giving privileges to [[Multinational corporation|international corporations]] and private entities creating a “double” legal standard.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  This concept diminished the “watchdog” and gives the flexibility for self-regulation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;   This instrument is based on the international gold standard of the [[19th century|nineteenth century]] which gave rights to investor to avoid certain jurisdictions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Permitting deregulation of financial services and trade investment avoids popular pressures and limits the need for transparency.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Minimizing liability and ensuring private authority the economic sector becomes more efficient, functional and practical.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Cutler, C. (2011). The Privatization of Authority in the Global Political Economy''.'' Edited by McBride, S., &amp; Teeple, G. ''In'' ''Relations of global power: Neoliberal order and disorder''. (p.41-59). Toronto: University of Toronto Press. {{ISBN|978-1-4426-0365-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Institutions ==
At the global and regional level institutions are implementing the new constitutionalism framework to advance [[global governance]] by upholding the rights of private corporations and promoting a free [[Capitalism|capitalist]] society.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  These institutions policies will ensure [[economic growth]] at the global level.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Sinclair, S. (2014). Trade agreements, the new constitutionalism and public services. Edited by ''Cutler, A., &amp; Gill, S.'' ''In New constitutionalism and world order.'' Cambridge, United Kingdom; New York, NY: Cambridge University Press, 179-195. {{ISBN|978-1-107-05369-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global ===
The [[World Trade Organization]] [[World Trade Organization|(WTO)]] is a prominent figure in governing the [[World economy|global economy]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Formally it was the responsibility of [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade|General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade]] built on [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] principles but lacked the greater power adapted through new constitutionalism.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  The [[World Trade Organization]] represents a governing global entity which has adapted to the principles of new constitutionalism.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  The [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] main purpose is to limit national interference in the global market and challenge any nation-state regulations that could be detrimental to the economy.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Any economic alternatives that are proposed by nations can be discredited by the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] as well as restricting governments ability to implement policy in international jurisdiction.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] represents the freedom of markets and allowing investors to capitalize in a [[world economy]], by doing so provides protection to the private sector.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Stephen McBride describes the [[World Trade Organization]] as having “quasi-judicial and quasi-constitutional aura.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  The judicial and constitutional supremacy highlights the difficulty in challenging the organizations because of lock in mechanisms.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Regional ===
The [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] ([[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]]) is a considered a regional governing entity that encompasses the principles of new constitutionalism.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  [[Ronald Reagan|President Ronald Regan]] referred to the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] as a “new economic constitution.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Constitution because the agreement provided restrictions on government intrusion, rights to certain actors and enforcement mechanisms.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  The binding agreement afforded rights to both foreign and domestic investor to protect the interests of private capital and corporations.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  By limiting government powers the agreement locked in private interests and reduced governments ability to expand or restore [[public service]]s in [[free trade]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Criticisms ==
Focus at the global level has resulted in hostility between the public and private realms within [[nation state]]s.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  This hostility creates a political struggle between the private sector who safeguard the rights of capital and the public who want to control [[capitalism]] politically, democracy and socially.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The control is being denationalized and delocalized causing negative repercussions at state level.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  New constitutionalism lacks political will and can have detrimental effects to global dignity and future generations.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Dividing economic policies from domestic creates disturbances within the civil society.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  [[Human rights]], [[Environmental issue|environmental concerns]] and [[public service]]s are being devalued because of the lack of economic concern.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

New constitutionalism favours the [[Elitism|elitists]] providing preferential treatment and widening the [[Economic inequality|social gap]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  [[International financial institutions]], [[investor]]s and bond-raters are holding higher positions of authority than governments or nation-states furthering global supremacy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  There is an urgent need for surveillance, policy making power, regulations and transparency economic outcomes are not solely focused on monetary gain but [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian]] concerns as well.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  The absence of accountability and democratic authority has led many countries to depart from the constitutional framework and reclaim their [[sovereignty]] as independent nations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; [[Australia]] has begun to constrain the advancements of new constitutionalism while many [[South America]] states have begun to exit the global regime completely.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  [[Canada]] and the [[United States]] have begun to form provisions to improve the democratic power within the global order and no longer allow for their governments to be immobilized.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

'''Our World In Data''' (OWID) is an [[Electronic publishing|online publication]] that presents empirical research and data that show how [[living conditions]] around the world are changing.  The web publication on [[International development|global development]] uses interactive [[Data visualization|data visualisations]] (charts and maps) to present the research findings on development that explain the causes and consequences of the observed changes.  The aim is to show how the world is changing and why.

The publication is developed at the [[University of Oxford]] and authored by social [[historian]] and development economist [[Max Roser]]. It covers a wide range of topics across many academic disciplines: Trends in [[health]], [[Hunger|food provision]], the [[Economic growth|growth]] and [[Economic inequality|distribution of incomes]], [[violence]], [[Human rights|rights]], [[war]]s, [[culture]], [[energy use]], [[education]], and [[environmental change]]s are empirically analysed and visualised in this web publication.

Covering all of these aspects in one resource makes it possible to understand how the observed long-run trends are interlinked. The research on global development is presented to the audience of interested readers, journalists, academics, and policy people. The articles cross-reference each other to make it possible for the reader to learn about the drivers of the observed long-run trends. For each topic the quality of the data is discussed and, by pointing the visitor to the sources, this website works as a database of databases – a meta-database.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ourworldindata.org/about/|title=About — Our World in Data|website=ourworldindata.org|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''PDC Order of Merit''' is a world ranking system used by one of the darts organisations, the [[Professional Darts Corporation]] (PDC). Following the [[2007 PDC World Darts Championship]] it superseded a world ranking system based on points being awarded for performances in ranking tournaments.

==How it works==
The Order of Merit is similar to that employed in golf's [[PGA European Tour|European Tour]]. Prize money won during the previous two seasons is calculated and the rankings are determined from this money list.
The Professional Darts Corporation adopted an Order of Merit system in 2007, which is based on prize money won over two years for the main Order of Merit and separate one-year rankings for other PDC Pro Tour events.

==PDC Top 32 Order of Merit==

==PDC ProTour Order of Merit==
The ProTour Order of Merit counts prize money won in Players Championship events, UK Open Qualifiers and European Tour events over a 12-month period. Players are seeded based on the ProTour Order of Merit to all Player Championship and European Tour events. It also is a main way to qualify to the major TV tournaments.

* The top 16 players in the ProTour Order of Merit not already qualified gain entry to the [[World Grand Prix (darts)|World Grand Prix]].
* The top 16 players in the ProTour Order of Merit not already qualified gain entry to the [[World Matchplay (darts)|World Matchplay]].
* The top 32 players in the ProTour Order of Merit not already qualified gain entry to the [[PDC World Darts Championship|World Championship]].

Besides ProTour Order of Merit there is also the Players Championship Order of Merit and the European Tour Order of Merit. Both of these are based solely on the prize money won in that year's Players Championship or European Tour events respectively. The top 64 players on the Players Championship Order of Merit after the last Player Championship event are the only qualifiers to the [[Players Championship Finals]]. The top 32 players on the European Tour Order of Merit after the last European Tour event are the only qualifiers to the [[European Championship (darts)|European Championship]].

==Player exemptions==
The PDC rankings determine exemptions from the qualifying competitions from each major event:
*The top 16 in '''early July''' get an automatic entry to the first round of the [[World Matchplay (darts)|World Matchplay]] &lt;small&gt;(as a seeded player)&lt;/small&gt;.
*The top 16 in '''late September''' get an automatic entry to the first round of the [[World Grand Prix (darts)|World Grand Prix]] &lt;small&gt;(top-8 as seeded players)&lt;/small&gt;.
*The top 32 in '''early December''' get an automatic entry to the first round of the [[PDC World Darts Championship|World Championship]] &lt;small&gt;(as a seeded player)&lt;/small&gt;.
*The top 4 '''after the World Championship''' get an automatic entry to the [[Premier League Darts|Premier League]].

==Televised Ranking Tournaments==
There is often a lot of confusion with televised tournaments and knowing which ones count towards the PDC Order of Merit. While a lot of televised tournaments are ranked, some are not, usually due to the tournament in question having restricted places e.g.  Premier League.

==Previous world ranking system==
Under the previous ranking points system, [[Colin Lloyd]] was the world number one player in the PDC for most of 2005 and 2006, despite most of the major titles being shared between [[Phil Taylor (darts player)|Phil Taylor]], [[Raymond van Barneveld]] and [[John Part]]. Although Lloyd also won two major titles, he often accumulated ranking points in the less prestigious non-televised events, in which Taylor did not always compete. Similarly, Alan Warriner was world number one on four separate occasions before ever winning his first and only PDC major, the 2001 Grand Prix, while Taylor won eight world championships and a host of other titles during that period.

==First WDC/PDC rankings==
Following the [[Professional Darts Corporation|World Darts Council]] (now PDC) split from the [[British Darts Organisation]] during 1992-94 the WDC drew up its first ranking list in the run-up to its inaugural [[1994 PDC World Darts Championship|1994 World Championship]]. [[Mike Gregory (darts player)|Mike Gregory]] and [[Chris Johns (darts player)|Chris Johns]] later went back to the BDO set up and [[Bobby George]] and many of the non-UK players never competed in the early days of the WDC.{{citation needed|date=August 2010}}

[[File:1918FluVictimsStLouis.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.2|[[1918 flu pandemic|The 1918–1919 "Spanish flu" pandemic]] resulted in dramatic mortality worldwide.]]

A '''pandemic''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] πᾶν ''pan'' "all" and δῆμος ''demos'' "people") is an [[epidemic]] of [[infectious disease]] that has spread across a large region; for instance multiple [[continents]], or even worldwide.

A widespread [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] disease that is stable in terms of how many people are getting sick from it is not a pandemic. Further, [[Influenza pandemic|flu pandemics]] generally exclude recurrences of [[seasonal flu]]. Throughout history, there have been a number of pandemics, such as [[smallpox]] and [[tuberculosis]]. One of the most devastating pandemics was the [[Black Death]], which killed over 75 million people in 1350. The most recent pandemics include the [[HIV]] pandemic as well as the [[1918 flu pandemic|1918]]  and [[2009 flu pandemic|2009]] [[Influenza A virus subtype H1N1|H1N1]] pandemics.

== Definition and stages ==

[[File:Pandemie.jpg|thumb|left|Advice (in French and English) for travellers on risks of epidemics abroad. Posters from the Charles De Gaulle airport, Paris, 2016.]]
A pandemic is an [[epidemic]] occurring on a scale which crosses international boundaries, usually affecting a large number of people.&lt;ref name=Porta2008&gt;{{cite book|author=Miquel Porta|editor=Miquel Porta|title=Dictionary of Epidemiology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Dr8dyuzvTkC&amp;pg=PA179|accessdate=14 September 2012|date=3 July 2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-531449-6|page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pandemics can also occur in important agricultural organisms (livestock, crop plants, fish, tree species) or in other organisms.

The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) has a six-stage classification that describes the process by which a novel influenza virus moves from the first few infections in humans through to a pandemic. This starts with the virus mostly infecting animals, with a few cases where animals infect people, then moves through the stage where the virus begins to spread directly between people, and ends with a pandemic when infections from the new virus have spread worldwide and it will be out of control until we stop it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/phase/en/ "Current WHO phase of pandemic alert"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928032422/http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/phase/en/ |date=2011-09-28 }}, World Health Organization 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

A disease or condition is not a pandemic merely because it is widespread or kills many people; it must also be infectious. For instance, [[cancer]] is responsible for many deaths but is not considered a pandemic because the disease is not infectious or contagious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=A. M.|first1=Dumar|title=Swine Flu: What You Need to Know|date=2009|publisher=Wildside Press LLC|isbn=9781434458322|page=7|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a virtual press conference in May 2009 on the influenza pandemic, Dr Keiji Fukuda, Assistant Director-General ''ad interim'' for Health Security and Environment, WHO said "An easy way to think about pandemic … is to say: a pandemic is a global outbreak. Then you might ask yourself: 'What is a global outbreak'? Global outbreak means that we see both spread of the agent … and then we see disease activities in addition to the spread of the virus."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/influenzaAH1N1_presstranscript_20090526.pdf |title=WHO press conference on 2009 pandemic influenza |format=PDF |date=26 May 2009 |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In planning for a possible influenza pandemic, the WHO published a document on pandemic preparedness guidance in 1999, revised in 2005 and in February 2009, defining phases and appropriate actions for each phase in an aide memoir entitled ''WHO pandemic phase descriptions and main actions by phase''. The 2009 revision, including definitions of a pandemic and the phases leading to its declaration, were finalized in February 2009. The pandemic H1N1 2009 virus was neither on the horizon at that time nor mentioned in the document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/PIPGuidance09.pdf|title=Pandemic influenza preparedness and response|publisher=World Health Organization|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513194204/http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/PIPGuidance09.pdf|archivedate=2011-05-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/GIPA3AideMemoire.pdf WHO pandemic phase descriptions and main actions by phase] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910112007/http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/GIPA3AideMemoire.pdf |date=September 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All versions of this document refer to influenza.

== Pandemics and notable epidemics through history ==
{{See also|List of epidemics|Columbian Exchange|Globalization and disease}}

There have been a number of significant pandemics recorded in human [[history]], generally [[zoonosis|zoonoses]] which came about with [[domestication]] of animals, such as [[influenza]] and tuberculosis. There have been a number of particularly significant epidemics that deserve mention above the "mere" destruction of cities:
* [[Plague of Athens]], 430 BC. Possibly [[typhoid fever]] killed a quarter of the Athenian troops, and a quarter of the population over four years. This disease fatally weakened the dominance of [[Athens]], but the sheer virulence of the disease prevented its wider spread; i.e. it killed off its hosts at a rate faster than they could spread it. The exact cause of the plague was unknown for many years. In January 2006, researchers from the [[University of Athens]] analyzed [[teeth]] recovered from a [[mass grave]] underneath the city, and confirmed the presence of [[bacteria]] responsible for typhoid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=000BF619-9B78-13D6-9B7883414B7F0135&amp;ref=sciam&amp;chanID=sa003 "Ancient Athenian Plague Proves to Be Typhoid"].

* [[Antonine Plague]], 165–180 AD.

* [[Plague of Justinian]], from 541 to 750, was the first recorded outbreak of the [[bubonic plague]]. It started in [[Egypt]], and reached [[Constantinople]] the following spring, killing (according to the Byzantine chronicler [[Procopius]]) 10,000 a day at its height, and perhaps 40% of the city's inhabitants. The plague went on to eliminate a quarter to a half of the [[human population]] that it struck throughout the known world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521846390&amp;ss=fro |title=Cambridge Catalogue page "Plague and the End of Antiquity" |publisher=Cambridge.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.speakeasy-forum.com/lofiversion/index.php/t18579.html Quotes from book "Plague and the End of Antiquity"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716114235/http://www.speakeasy-forum.com/lofiversion/index.php/t18579.html |date=2011-07-16 }} Lester K.

Encounters between European explorers and populations in the rest of the world often introduced local epidemics of extraordinary virulence. Disease killed part of the native population of the [[Canary Islands]] in the 16th century ([[Guanches]]). Half the native population of [[Hispaniola]] in 1518 was killed by smallpox.

* The [[1889–1890 flu pandemic]], also known as Russian Flu, was first reported in May 1889 in [[Bukhara]], Uzbekistan. By October, it had reached [[Tomsk]] and the [[Caucasus]]. It rapidly spread west and hit [[North America]] in December 1889, South America in February–April 1890, India in February–March 1890, and Australia in March–April 1890. The [[H3N8]] and [[H2N2]] subtypes of the Influenza A virus have each been identified as possible causes. It had a very high attack and [[mortality rate]], causing around a million fatalities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/panflu/biofacts/index.html CIDRAP] article ''Pandemic Influenza'' Last updated 16 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Typhus ===
[[Typhus]] is sometimes called "camp fever" because of its pattern of flaring up in times of strife. (It is also known as "gaol fever" and "ship fever", for its habits of spreading wildly in cramped quarters, such as jails and ships.) Emerging during the [[Crusades]], it had its first impact in Europe in 1489, in Spain. During fighting between the Christian Spaniards and the Muslims in [[Granada]], the Spanish lost 3,000 to war casualties, and 20,000 to typhus. In 1528, the French lost 18,000 troops in [[Italy]], and lost supremacy in Italy to the Spanish. In 1542, 30,000 soldiers died of typhus while fighting the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in the Balkans.

During the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–1648), about 8 million Germans were killed by bubonic plague and typhus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,794989,00.html War and Pestilence]. ''TIME.'' April 29, 1940&lt;/ref&gt; The disease also played a major role in the destruction of [[Napoleon]]'s ''[[La Grande Armée|Grande Armée]]'' in Russia in 1812. During the retreat from Moscow, more French military personnel died of [[typhus]] than were killed by the Russians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://entomology.montana.edu/historybug/TYPHUS-Conlon.pdf The Historical Impact of Epidemic Typhus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611213940/http://entomology.montana.edu/historybug/TYPHUS-Conlon.pdf |date=2010-06-11 }}.

=== Measles ===
Historically, [[measles]] was prevalent throughout the world, as it is highly contagious. According to the U.S. [[National Immunization Program]], 90% of people were infected with measles by age 15. Before the vaccine was introduced in 1963, there were an estimated 3–4 million
cases in the U.S. each year.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Center for Disease Control &amp; National Immunization Program. Measles History, article online 2001.

Measles is an [[endemic disease]], meaning that it has been continually present in a community, and many people develop resistance. In populations that have not been exposed to measles, exposure to a new disease can be devastating. In 1529, a measles outbreak in [[Cuba]] killed two-thirds of the natives who had previously survived smallpox.&lt;ref&gt;''Man and Microbes: Disease and Plagues in History and Modern Times''; by [[Arno Karlen]]&lt;/ref&gt; The disease had ravaged [[Mexico]], [[Central America]], and the [[Inca]] civilization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.millersville.edu/~columbus/data/art/RUVALCA1.ART "Measles and Small Pox as an Allied Army of the Conquistadors of America"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502200745/http://www.millersville.edu/~columbus/data/art/RUVALCA1.ART |date=2009-05-02 }} by Carlos Ruvalcaba, translated by Theresa M.

=== Viral hemorrhagic fevers ===
Viral hemorrhagic fevers such as [[Ebola virus disease]], [[Lassa fever virus]], [[Rift Valley fever]], [[Marburg virus]] and [[Bolivian hemorrhagic fever]] are highly contagious and deadly diseases, with the theoretical potential to become pandemics. Their ability to spread efficiently enough to cause a pandemic is limited, however, as transmission of these viruses requires close contact with the infected [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]], and the vector only has a short time before death or serious illness. Furthermore, the short time between a vector becoming infectious and the onset of symptoms allows medical professionals to quickly [[quarantine]] vectors, and prevent them from carrying the pathogen elsewhere. Genetic mutations could occur, which could elevate their potential for causing widespread harm; thus close observation by contagious disease specialists is merited.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

=== Antibiotic resistance ===
{{Main|Antibiotic resistance}}
Antibiotic-resistant microorganisms, sometimes referred to as "[[Antibiotic resistance|superbug]]s", may contribute to the re-emergence of diseases which are currently well controlled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pasteur.fr/actu/presse/press/07pesteTIGR_E.htm Researchers sound the alarm: the multidrug resistance of the plague bacillus could spread] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014012153/http://www.pasteur.fr/actu/presse/press/07pesteTIGR_E.htm |date=2007-10-14 }}.

Every year, nearly half a million new cases of [[multidrug-resistant tuberculosis]] (MDR-TB) are estimated to occur worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2009/tuberculosis_drug_resistant_20090402/en/index.html Health ministers to accelerate efforts against drug-resistant TB].

''Guardian.co.uk''. April 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) reports that approximately 50 million people worldwide are infected with MDR TB, with 79 percent of those cases resistant to three or more antibiotics. In 2005, 124 cases of [[MDR TB]] were reported in the United States. Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis ([[XDR TB]]) was identified in Africa in 2006, and subsequently discovered to exist in 49 countries, including the United States. There are about 40,000 new cases of XDR-TB per year, the WHO estimates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2008/HEALTH/11/17/tb.pandemic/index.html Tuberculosis: A new pandemic?]. CNN.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past 20 years, common bacteria including ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', ''[[Serratia marcescens]]'' and [[Enterococcus]], have developed resistance to various [[antibiotics]] such as [[vancomycin]], as well as whole classes of antibiotics, such as the [[aminoglycosides]] and [[cephalosporins]]. Antibiotic-resistant organisms have become an important cause of healthcare-associated (nosocomial) infections (HAI). In addition, infections caused by community-acquired strains of methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'' ([[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]]) in otherwise healthy individuals have become more frequent in recent years. &lt;!-- Antibiotics are not described as "strongest"; each has a specific range of activity. Antibiotics that are effective against many types of bacteria are termed "broad spectrum". Vancomycin is only effective against Gram-positive organisms, such as sensitive strains of ''S. aureus'' and Enterococcus. --&gt; &lt;!-- HAIs are a serious concern, but do not meet the definition of a pandemic --&gt;

=== SARS ===
In 2003 the Italian physician [[Carlo Urbani]] (1956–2003) was the first to identify severe acute respiratory syndrome ([[SARS]]) as a new and dangerously contagious disease, although he became infected and died. It is caused by a [[coronavirus]] dubbed [[SARS-CoV]]. Rapid action by national and international health authorities such as the [[World Health Organization]] helped to slow transmission and eventually broke the chain of transmission, which ended the localized epidemics before they could become a pandemic. However, the disease has not been eradicated. It could re-emerge. This warrants monitoring and reporting of suspicious cases of atypical pneumonia.

=== Influenza ===
{{Main|Influenza pandemic}}

Wild aquatic birds are the natural hosts for a range of [[influenza]] A viruses. Occasionally, viruses are transmitted from these species to other species, and may then cause outbreaks in domestic poultry or, rarely, in humans.&lt;ref name=sobrino6&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.horizonpress.com/avir |author=Klenk|year=2008 |chapter=Avian Influenza: Molecular Mechanisms of Pathogenesis and Host Range |title=Animal Viruses: Molecular Biology |publisher=Caister Academic Press |isbn=978-1-904455-22-6|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kawaoka&gt;{{cite book |author=Kawaoka Y (editor). |title=Influenza Virology: Current Topics |publisher=Caister Academic Press |year=2006 |url=http://www.horizonpress.com/flu |isbn=978-1-904455-06-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== H5N1 (Avian Flu) ====
{{Main|Influenza A virus subtype H5N1}}

In February 2004, [[avian influenza]] virus was detected in birds in [[Vietnam]], increasing fears of the emergence of new variant strains. It is feared that if the avian influenza virus combines with a human influenza virus (in a bird or a human), the new subtype created could be both highly contagious and highly lethal in humans. Such a subtype could cause a global influenza pandemic, similar to the [[Spanish Flu]], or the lower mortality pandemics such as the [[Asian Flu]] and the [[Hong Kong Flu]].

From October 2004 to February 2005, some 3,700 test kits of the 1957 [[Asian Flu]] virus were accidentally spread around the world from a lab in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=MacKenzie D |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7261 |title=Pandemic-causing 'Asian flu' accidentally released |date=13 April 2005 |work=New Scientist }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2005, scientists urgently called upon nations to prepare for a global influenza pandemic that could strike as much as 20% of the world's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/may/25/birdflu |title=Flu pandemic 'could hit 20% of world's population' |publisher=guardian.co.uk |date=25 May 2005 | location=London | accessdate=May 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2005, cases of the avian flu (the deadly strain [[H5N1]]) were identified in [[Turkey]]. EU Health Commissioner Markos Kyprianou said: "We have received now confirmation that the virus found in Turkey is an avian flu H5N1 virus. There is a direct relationship with viruses found in Russia, Mongolia and China." Cases of bird flu were also identified shortly thereafter in [[Romania]], and then [[Greece]]. Possible cases of the virus have also been found in [[Croatia]], [[Bulgaria]] and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4348404.stm |title=Bird flu is confirmed in Greece |work=BBC NEWS |date=17 October 2005 | accessdate=2010-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By November 2007, numerous confirmed cases of the [[H5N1]] strain had been identified across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/world/05/bird_flu_map/html/1.stm |title=Bird Flu Map |work=BBC NEWS | accessdate=2010-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, by the end of October, only 59 people had died as a result of H5N1, which was atypical of previous influenza pandemics.

Avian flu cannot yet be categorized as a "pandemic", because the virus cannot yet cause sustained and efficient human-to-human transmission. Cases so far are recognized to have been transmitted from bird to human, but as of December 2006, there have been very few (if any) cases of proven human-to-human transmission.&lt;ref&gt;WHO (2005). Avian Influenza A (H5N1) Infection in Humans http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra052211&lt;/ref&gt; Regular influenza viruses establish infection by attaching to receptors in the throat and lungs, but the avian influenza virus can only attach to receptors located deep in the lungs of humans, requiring close, prolonged contact with infected patients, and thus limiting person-to-person transmission.

=== Zika virus ===
{{Main|Zika virus outbreak in the Americas (2015–present)|Zika virus|Zika fever}}
An outbreak of [[Zika virus]] began in 2015 and strongly intensified throughout the start of 2016, with over 1.5 million cases across more than a dozen countries in [[the Americas]]. The World Health Organisation warned that Zika had the potential to become an explosive global pandemic if the outbreak was not controlled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-35425731|title=Zika virus could become 'explosive pandemic'|date=28 January 2016|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic consequences of pandemic events ===
In 2016, the Commission on a Global Health Risk Framework for the Future estimated that pandemic disease events would cost the global economy over $6 trillion in the 21st century - over $60 billion per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nam.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Neglected-Dimension-of-Global-Security.pdf|title=Global Health Risk Framework - The Neglected Dimension of Global Security: A Framework to Counter Infectious Disease Crises|last=|first=|date=2016-01-16|website=|publisher=National Academy of Medicine|access-date=2016-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same report also recommended spending $4.5 billion annually on global prevention and response capabilities to reduce the threat posed by pandemic events.

== Biological warfare ==
{{Further|Biological warfare}}
In 1346, the bodies of Mongol warriors who had died of plague were thrown over the walls of the besieged [[Crimea]]n city of [[Caffa|Kaffa]] (now [[Feodosiya|Theodosia]]). After a protracted siege, during which the [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] army under [[Jani Beg]] was suffering the disease, they catapulted the infected corpses over the city walls to infect the inhabitants. It has been speculated that this operation may have been responsible for the arrival of the [[Black Death]] in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wheelis M |title=Biological Warfare at the 1346 Siege of Caffa |journal=Emerging Infect. Dis. |volume=8 |issue=9 |pages=971–5 |date=September 2002 |pmid=12194776 |url=http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/8/9/01-0536_article |pmc=2732530 |doi=10.3201/eid0809.010536}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] population was devastated after contact with the [[Old World]] by introduction of many fatal diseases. In a well documented case of germ warfare involving British commander [[Jeffery Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|Jeffery Amherst]] and Swiss-British officer Colonel [[Henry Bouquet]], their correspondence included a proposal and agreement to give smallpox-infected blankets to Indians in order to "Extirpate this Execrable Race". During the [[siege of Fort Pitt]] late in the [[French and Indian War]], as recorded in his journal by sundries trader and militia Captain, [[William Trent]], on June 24, 1763, dignitaries from the Delaware tribe met with Fort Pitt officials, warned them of "great numbers of Indians" coming to attack the fort, and pleaded with them to leave the fort while there was still time. The commander of the fort refused to abandon the fort. Instead, the British gave as gifts two blankets, one silk handkerchief and one linen from the smallpox hospital to two Delaware Indian dignitaries.&lt;ref name="Fenn"&gt;Fenn, Elizabeth A.

During the [[Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945)|Sino-Japanese War]] (1937–1945), [[Unit 731]] of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] conducted [[Japanese war crimes#Human experimentation and biological warfare|human experimentation]] on thousands, mostly Chinese. In military campaigns, the Japanese army used biological weapons on Chinese soldiers and civilians. Plague fleas, infected clothing, and infected supplies encased in bombs were dropped on various targets. The resulting [[cholera]], [[anthrax]], and plague were estimated to have killed around 400,000 Chinese civilians.

Diseases considered for or known to be used as a weapon include [[anthrax]], [[ebola]], [[Marburg virus]], plague, [[cholera]], [[typhus]], [[Rocky Mountain spotted fever]], [[tularemia]], [[brucellosis]], [[Q fever]], [[machupo]], [[Coccidioides mycosis]], [[Glanders]], [[Melioidosis]], [[Shigella]], [[Psittacosis]], [[Japanese encephalitis|Japanese B encephalitis]], [[Rift Valley fever]], [[yellow fever]], and smallpox.&lt;ref name="Alibek"/&gt;

Spores of weaponized anthrax were accidentally released from a military facility near the Soviet [[closed city]] of [[Yekaterinburg|Sverdlovsk]] in 1979. The [[Sverdlovsk anthrax leak]] is sometimes called "biological [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]]".&lt;ref name="Alibek"&gt;[[Ken Alibek]] and S. Handelman.

'''''Parmelia sulcata''''' is a [[foliose lichen]] in the family [[Parmeliaceae]].  It is very tolerant of pollution and has a [[cosmopolitan distribution]], making it one of the most common [[lichen]]s. It harbours a unicellular ''[[Trebouxia]]'' green algal symbiont.

==Taxonomy==
First described by [[Thomas Taylor (botanist)|Thomas Taylor]] in 1836 under its current name, ''Parmelia sulcata'' has a large number of named [[variety (botany)|varieties]] and [[form (botany)|forms]], but no [[subspecies]] despite its extensive range. Most taxonomists have left the species in the [[genus]] to which Taylor originally assigned it, though [[mycologist]] [[Maurice Gustave Benoit Choisy|Maurice Choisy]] assigned it to the genus ''[[Parmotrema]]'' in 1952.&lt;ref name = "MycoBank"/&gt;

The genus name ''Parmelia'' is a compound of two [[Greek language|Greek]] words: ''parme'', meaning "fruit bowl" and ''-eileo'', meaning "enclosed". This likely refers to the [[wiktionary:lecanorine|lecanorine]] [[apothecia]] of species belonging to the genus.&lt;ref name = "Hinds"/&gt; The [[specific epithet (botany)|specific epithet]] ''sulcata'' is derived from ''sulcatus'', meaning "grooved" or "furrowed".&lt;ref name = "Stearn"/&gt; The species is known by a number of colloquial names, including '''hammered shield lichen''',&lt;ref name = "Brodo"/&gt; '''cracked-shield lichen''',&lt;ref name = "Houck"/&gt; '''powdered crottle''',&lt;ref name = "PlantLife"/&gt; '''furrowed shield lichen''', '''powdered shield''', and '''waxpaper lichen'''.&lt;ref name = "Qian"/&gt;

==Description==
''Parmelia sulcata'' is a foliose lichen with a generally circular [[thallus]] that can range in color from [[wiktionary:glaucous|glaucous]] white to gray on the upper [[cortex (botany)|cortex]]; the lower surface is black. The thallus is broadly lobed.&lt;ref name = "Dobson"/&gt; Each lobe measures between {{convert|2|–|5|mm|abbr=on|2}} in width,&lt;ref name = "Brodo"/&gt; and lobes are overlapping.&lt;ref name = "Dobson"/&gt;

The lichen's [[medulla (lichenology)|medulla]] and [[soredia]] react positively with [[potassium hydroxide]] (K), turning red-orange. They react positively with [[p-Phenylenediamine|para-phenylenediamene]] (Pd) as well, also turning orange. The lichen does not fluoresce in ultraviolet light.&lt;ref name = "Dobson"/&gt;

==Distribution and habitat==
''Parmelia sulcata'' is a common species throughout much of the world, found from temperate to cold regions of both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.&lt;ref name = "Amo de Paz"/&gt;

==Ecology==
This species can be used to make dyes, producing a reddish-brown color.&lt;ref name = "Casselman"/&gt; [[Indigenous people]] in North America used the lichen medicinally. The [[Métis]] peoples rubbed it on the gums of teething babies, while the [[Saanich people]]s used it for a variety of ailments, with the medicinal qualities depending on what type of tree it was harvested from.&lt;ref name = "Ranković"/&gt;

It often grows in lichen communities with other species. In the [[Jura Mountains]] of Switzerland, for example, it regularly occurs with ''[[Lobaria pulmonaria]]'' and various ''[[Nephroma]]'' species.&lt;ref name = "Werth"/&gt;

'''Population health''' has been defined as "the health outcomes of a group of individuals, including the distribution of such outcomes within the group".&lt;ref name="pmid12604476"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kindig D, Stoddart G | date = March 2003 | title = What is population health? | url = http://www.ajph.org/cgi/reprint/93/3/380.pdf | format = PDF | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 93 | issue = 3| pages = 380–3 | doi=10.2105/ajph.93.3.380 |pmid=12604476 | pmc=1447747}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an approach to [[health]] that aims to improve the [[health]] of an entire human population. This concept does not refer to animal or plant populations. It has been described as consisting of three components. These are "health outcomes, patterns of health determinants, and [[Population health policies and interventions|policies and interventions]]".&lt;ref name="pmid12604476" /&gt;  A priority considered important in achieving the aim of Population Health is to reduce health inequities or disparities among different population groups due to, among other factors, the [[social determinants of health]], SDOH. The SDOH include all the factors (social, environmental, cultural and physical) that the different populations are born into, grow up and function with throughout their lifetimes which potentially have a measurable impact on the health of human populations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topicsobjectives2020/overview.aspx?topicid=39 Social Determinants of Health overview tab.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Population Health concept represents a change in the focus from the individual-level, characteristic of most mainstream [[medicine]]. It also seeks to complement the classic efforts of [[public health]] agencies by addressing a broader range of factors shown to impact the health of different populations. The World Health Organization's Commission on Social Determinants of Health, reported in 2008, that the SDOH factors were responsible for the bulk of diseases and injuries and these were the major causes of health inequities in all countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/sdhconference/resources/Conference_Report.pdf Meeting Report of World Conference of Social Determinants of Health] held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the US, SDOH were estimated to account for 70% of avoidable mortality.&lt;ref&gt;McGinnis JM, Williams-Russo P, Knickman JR. 2002.

==Healthy People 2020==

Healthy People 2020 is a web site sponsored by the [[US Department of Health and Human Services]], representing the cumulative effort of 34 years of interest by the Surgeon General's office and others. It identifies 42 topics considered [[social determinants of health]] and approximately 1200 specific goals considered to improve population health. It provides links to the current research available for selected topics and identifies and supports the need for community involvement considered essential to address these problems realistically.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/default.aspx Health People 2020]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The human role of economic inequality==

Recently, human role has been encouraged by the influence of population growth there has been increasing interest from [[epidemiology|epidemiologists]] on the subject of [[economic inequality]] and its relation to the health of populations. There is a very robust correlation between [[Social status|socioeconomic status]] and health. This correlation suggests that it is not only the poor who tend to be sick when everyone else is healthy,  [[heart disease]], [[Peptic ulcer|ulcers]], [[type 2 diabetes]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], certain types of [[cancer]], and [[premature aging]]. Despite the reality of the [[Socioeconomic status#health|SES Gradient]], there is debate as to its cause. A number of researchers (A. Leigh, C. Jencks, A. Clarkwest—see also Russell Sage working papers) see a definite link between economic status and mortality due to the greater economic resources of the better-off, but they find little correlation due to [[social status]] differences.

Other researchers such as [[Richard G. Wilkinson]], J. Lynch, and G.A. Kaplan have found that socioeconomic status strongly affects health even when controlling for economic resources and access to health care. Most famous for linking social status with health are the [[Whitehall Study|Whitehall studies]]—a series of studies conducted on [[civil servants]] in [[London]]. The studies found that, despite the fact that all civil servants in England have the same access to health care, there was a strong correlation between social status and health. The studies found that this relationship stayed strong even when controlling for health-affecting habits such as [[exercise]], [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]] and [[Alcoholic beverage|drinking]]. Furthermore, it has been noted that no amount of medical attention will help decrease the likelihood of someone getting [[type 1 diabetes]] or [[rheumatoid arthritis]]—yet both are more common among populations with lower socioeconomic status. Lastly, it has been found that amongst the wealthiest quarter of countries on earth (a set stretching from [[Luxembourg]] to [[Slovakia]]) there is no relation between a country's wealth and general population health{{ref|sci_amer_dec_2005}}—suggesting that past a certain level, absolute levels of wealth have little impact on population health, but relative levels within a country do.
The concept of [[psychosocial stress]] attempts to explain how psychosocial phenomenon such as [[Social status|status]] and [[social stratification]] can lead to the many diseases associated with the [[SES gradient]]. Higher levels of economic inequality tend to intensify social hierarchies and generally degrades the quality of social relations—leading to greater levels of [[Stress (medicine)|stress]] and stress related diseases. Richard Wilkinson found this to be true not only for the poorest members of society, but also for the wealthiest. Economic inequality is bad for everyone's health.''' 
Inequality does not only affect the health of human populations. David H. Abbott at the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center found that among many primate species, less egalitarian social structures correlated with higher levels of stress hormones among socially subordinate individuals. Research by [[Robert Sapolsky]] of [[Stanford University]] provides similar findings.

==Research==
There is well-documented variation in health outcomes and health care utilization &amp; costs by geographic variation in the U.S., down to the level of Hospital Referral Regions (defined as a regional health care market, which may cross state boundaries, of which there are 306 in the U.S.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Chandra, A |author2=Skinner, JS | title= Geography and Racial Health Disparities, Chapter 16 of Critical Perspectives on Racial and Ethnic Differences in Health in Late Life. |year=2004|publisher=National Research Council|url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/6555551.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dartmouthatlas.org/data/region/| title=Data by Region, the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care|accessdate=16 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is ongoing debate as to the relative contributions of race, gender, poverty, education level and place to these variations. The Office of Epidemiology of the [[Maternal and Child Health Bureau]] recommends using an analytic approach (Fixed Effects or hybrid Fixed Effects) to research on health disparities to reduce the confounding effects of neighborhood (geographic) variables on the outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Schempf, AH, Kaufman, JS | title= Accounting for context in studies of health inequalities: a review and comparison of analytic approaches. | journal=Annals of Epidemiology |volume=10| issue= 10 | year=2012|doi=10.1016/j.annepidem.2012.06.105 | pmid= 22858050 | pages=683–690| url= https://zenodo.org/record/1258734 | type= Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The importance of family planning programs==
[[Family planning]] programs (including [[Birth control|contraceptives]], [[sex education|sexuality education]], and promotion of [[safe sex]]) play a major role in population health. Family planning is one of the most highly cost-effective interventions in medicine.&lt;ref name=Tsui&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tsui AO, McDonald-Mosley R, Burke AE |title=Family planning and the burden of unintended pregnancies |journal=Epidemiol Rev |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=152–74 |date=April 2010 |pmid=20570955 |pmc=3115338 |doi=10.1093/epirev/mxq012 |url= | quote=International studies confirm that family planning is among the most cost-effective of all health interventions (80, 81).

==Population health management (PHM)==
One method to improve population health is population health management (PHM), which has been defined as "the technical field of endeavor which utilizes a variety of individual, organizational and cultural interventions to help improve the [[morbidity]] patterns (i.e., the illness and injury burden) and the health care use behavior of defined populations".&lt;ref&gt;Hillman, Michael.

== Healthcare reform and population health ==
Healthcare reform is driving change to traditional hospital reimbursement models. Prior to the introduction of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA)]], hospitals were reimbursed based on the volume of procedures through [[fee-for-service]] models. Under the PPACA, reimbursement models are shifting from volume to value. New reimbursement models are built around [[Pay for performance (healthcare)|pay for performance]], a value-based reimbursement approach, which places financial incentives around patient outcomes and has drastically changed the way US hospitals must conduct business to remain financially viable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Revised Medicare ACO Program: More Options … And More Work Ahead|url = http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2015/06/16/the-revised-medicare-aco-program-more-options-and-more-work-ahead/|website = Health Affairs|accessdate = 21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to focusing on improving patient experience of care and reducing costs, hospitals must also focus on improving the health of populations (IHI Triple Aim&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The IHI Triple Aim|url = http://www.ihi.org/engage/initiatives/TripleAim/Pages/default.aspx|website = www.ihi.org|accessdate = 21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

These factors all have the potential to increase earnings. Some states, like New York, have implemented statewide initiatives to address population health. In New York state there are 11 such programs. One example is the Mohawk Valley Population Health Improvement Program (http://www.mvphip.org/). These programs work to address the needs of the people in their region, as well as assist their local community based organizations and social services to gather data, address health disparities, and explore evidence-based interventions that will ultimately lead to better health for everyone. Following a similar approach, Cullati et al. developed a theoretical framework for the development and onset of vulnerability in later life based on the concept of "reserves".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cullati|first=Stéphane|last2=Kliegel|first2=Matthias|last3=Widmer|first3=Eric|date=2018|title=Development of reserves over the life course and onset of vulnerability in later life|journal=Nature Human Behaviour|language=En|volume=2|issue=8|pages=551–558|doi=10.1038/s41562-018-0395-3|issn=2397-3374}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advantages to use the concept of reserves in interdisciplinary studies, as compared with related concepts such as resources and capital, is to strengthen the importance of constitution and sustainability of reserves (the “use it or lose it” paradigm) and the presence of thresholds, below which functioning becomes challenging.

'''''Ricciocarpos natans''''' is the only species in the genus '''''Ricciocarpos''''', a genus of [[Marchantiophyta|liverwort]]s in the family [[Ricciaceae]].&lt;ref name="Campbell 1918" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Crandall-Stotler 2000" /&gt; It was formerly listed in 1759 as a species of ''[[Riccia]]'' by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]], but then assigned to a new genus of its own in 1829 by [[August Carl Joseph Corda]].

Despite having many common features with the genus ''Riccia'',&lt;ref name="Campbell 1918" /&gt; its most obvious difference from that genus are the long sword-shaped purple scales that hang from the under surface of floating plants.&lt;ref name="Schuster VI" /&gt; The genus has occasionally appeared in the literature under the spelling '''''Ricciocarpus''''', but the spelling with an '''o''' is the original and accepted spelling.&lt;ref name="Grolle 1983" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Crandall-Stotler 2000" /&gt; The [[botanical name|specific epithet]] "''natans''" comes from the Latin word for "swimming", because plants typically float freely in ponds or quiet waters.

Plants of ''R. natans'' have two very different forms, depending on the conditions under which the plant grows. One form develops in plants that grow on land (terrestrial), and another form develops when plants grow floating in the water (aquatic). The terrestrial form develops into [[rosette (botany)|rosette]]s 25–35 millimetres across,&lt;ref name="Howe 1923" /&gt; of short and narrow branches having almost parallel sides. The more usual form is aquatic, and develops as broader, heart-shaped [[thallus]] with fewer branchings and long slender purple scales hanging from the underside. The two forms are so physically different from each other that they were originally thought to be different species.&lt;ref name="Schuster VI" /&gt;

''Ricciocarpos'' is distributed globally, being found almost everywhere except the polar regions&lt;ref name="Schuster VI" /&gt; though it is rare in parts of the tropics.&lt;ref name="Wigginton 2004" /&gt; It may form extensive floating colonies in quiet waters,&lt;ref name="Schofield 1985" /&gt; and grows readily in laboratory cultures.&lt;ref name="Bold 1987" /&gt; Although fertile plants are not unknown, mature plants bearing spore capsules are rarely found. It is therefore assumed that ''Ricciocarpos'' spreads primarily through [[vegetative reproduction]] as the plants break apart.&lt;ref name="Allison 1975" /&gt; It has been suggested that the aquatic forms remain sterile and that sexual reproduction is largely limited to terrestrial forms,&lt;ref name="Kashyap 1929" /&gt; but other sources maintain that terrestrial forms are normally sterile as well.&lt;ref name="Bold 1987" /&gt;

[[File:Grundig Satellit Professional 400.JPG|thumb|right|[[Grundig]] Satellit 400 solid-state, digital [[shortwave receiver]], c. 1986 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shortwaveradio.ch/radio-e/grundig-sat400-e.htm Grundig Satellit 400 international/professional] ShortWaveRadio.ch&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Shortwave radio''' is [[radio]] transmission using shortwave [[radio frequencies]]. There is no official definition of the band, but the range always includes all of the [[High frequency|high frequency band (HF)]], and generally extends from {{convert|1.7|–|30|MHz|m|abbr=on}}; from the high end of the [[Medium frequency|medium frequency band (MF)]] just above the [[mediumwave]] AM broadcast band, to the end of the [[High frequency|HF band]].

Radio waves in the shortwave band can be reflected or refracted from a layer of electrically charged atoms in the atmosphere called the [[ionosphere]]. Therefore, short waves directed at an angle into the sky can be reflected back to Earth at great distances, beyond the horizon.  This is called [[skywave]] or "skip" [[radio propagation|propagation]].  Thus shortwave radio can be used for very long distance communication, in contrast to radio waves of higher frequency which travel in straight lines ([[line-of-sight propagation]]) and are limited by the visual horizon, about {{convert|40|miles|km}}.  Shortwave radio is used for [[broadcasting]] of voice and music to [[shortwave listening|shortwave listeners]] over very large areas; sometimes entire continents or beyond. It is also used for military [[over-the-horizon radar]], diplomatic communication, and two-way international communication by [[amateur radio]] enthusiasts for hobby, educational and emergency purposes, as well as for long distance aviation and marine communications.

==Frequency classifications==
The widest popular definition of the shortwave frequency interval is the [[ITU Region 1|ITU Region&amp;nbsp;1 (EU+Africa+Russia...)]] definition, and is the span 1.6–30&amp;nbsp;[[MHz]], just above the [[medium wave]] band, which ends approximately at 1.6&amp;nbsp;MHz.

There are also other definitions of the shortwave frequency interval:
* 1.71&amp;nbsp;to 30&amp;nbsp;MHz in [[ITU Region 2|ITU Region 2 (North and South America...)]]
* 1.8&amp;nbsp;(160&amp;nbsp;meter radio amateur band start) to 30&amp;nbsp;MHz
* 2.3&amp;nbsp;(120&amp;nbsp;meter band start) to 30&amp;nbsp;MHz
* 2.3&amp;nbsp;(120&amp;nbsp;meter band start) to 26.1&amp;nbsp;MHz (11&amp;nbsp;meter band end)&lt;ref&gt;Inconsistent article: [http://www.itwissen.info/definition/lexikon/Kurzwelle-SW-short-wave-KW.html itwissen.info: KW (Kurzwelle) SW (short wave)] Quote: "... Der KW-Frequenzbereich (SW) liegt zwischen 3&amp;nbsp;MHz und 30&amp;nbsp;MHz&amp;nbsp;[&lt;-1.&amp;nbsp;definition] ... Kurzwelle ist auch eine sendetechnische Bezeichnung für Rundfunk im Frequenzbereich zwischen 2,3&amp;nbsp;MHz und 26,1&amp;nbsp;MHz&amp;nbsp;[&lt;-2.&amp;nbsp;definition] ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldtimeradio.de/lexikon.php oldtimeradio.de: Kleines Radio-Lexikon] Quote: "... Kurzwellen, Kurzwellenbereich ... Wellenbereich, der von den Rundfunksendern (je nach geographischer Lage) von 11 bis 120&amp;nbsp;m = 26.100 bis 2.300&amp;nbsp;kHz ..."&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Germany]] and perhaps [[Austria]] the [[ITU Region 1|ITU Region&amp;nbsp;1]] shortwave radio frequency interval can be subdivided in:
** ''[[:de:Grenzwelle]]'' ("border waves"): 1.605–3.8&amp;nbsp;MHz&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darc.de/distrikte/k/35/afu-frequenzen/ darc.de: Amateurfunk Frequenzen] Quote: "... Grenzwelle (Kurzwelle) ...", ''[[:de:Grenzwelle]]'' Quote: "... Als Grenzwelle wird der Frequenzbereich zwischen 1605&amp;nbsp;kHz und 3800&amp;nbsp;kHz bezeichnet, weil er auf der „Grenze" zwischen Mittelwelle und Kurzwelle liegt ..."&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Germany these shortwave radio frequency intervals have also been seen used:
** the above other definitions&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.owdjim.gen.nz/chris/radio/Grundig/diags.php Grundig Satellit 1000 TR6002], [http://www.owdjim.gen.nz/chris/radio/Grundig/large/CircuitDiagram.jpg schematic] See at the bottom of the schematic, just below the transformer. In the schematic it is written that the first shortwave band starts at 1.6&amp;nbsp;MHz (just after the band end of MW/AM): "KW1-SW1-OC1 1,6 .... 5,0&amp;nbsp;MHz"&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Development===
[[File:Guglielmo Marconi 1901 wireless signal.jpg|thumb|right|Radio amateurs carried out the first shortwave transmissions over a long distance before [[Guglielmo Marconi]]]]

The name "shortwave" originated during the early days of radio in the early 20th century, when the [[radio spectrum]] was considered divided into [[long wave]] (LW), [[medium wave]] (MW) and short wave bands based on the [[wavelength]] of the [[radio wave]]s. Shortwave radio received its name because the wavelengths in this band are relatively shorter than 200&amp;nbsp;m (1,500&amp;nbsp;kHz) which marked the original upper limit of the [[medium frequency]] band [[History of radio|first used]] for radio communications. The broadcast [[medium wave]] band now extends above the 200&amp;nbsp;m/1,500&amp;nbsp;kHz limit, and the [[amateur radio]] 1.8&amp;nbsp;MHz&amp;nbsp;– 2.0&amp;nbsp;MHz band (known as the "[[top band]]") is the lowest-frequency band considered to be 'shortwave'. 

Early long distance [[radio telegraphy]] used [[long wave]]s, below 300&amp;nbsp;[[kilohertz]] (kHz).  The drawbacks to this system included a very limited spectrum available for long distance communication, and the very expensive [[transmitter]]s, receivers and gigantic antennas that were required. It was also difficult to beam the radio wave directionally with long wave, resulting in a major loss of power over long distances.  Prior to the 1920s, the shortwave frequencies above 1.5&amp;nbsp;MHz were regarded as useless for long distance communication and were designated in many countries for amateur use.&lt;ref name="Nebeker2009"&gt;{{cite book|first=Frederik|last=Nebeker|title=Dawn of the Electronic Age: Electrical Technologies in the Shaping of the Modern World, 1914 to 1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xwmH6-q5O5AC&amp;pg=PA157|date=6 May 2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-40974-9|pages=157–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Guglielmo Marconi]], pioneer of radio, commissioned his assistant [[Charles Samuel Franklin]] to carry out a large scale study into the transmission characteristics of short wavelength waves and to determine their suitability for long distance transmissions. Franklin rigged up a large antenna at [[Poldhu|Poldhu Wireless Station]], [[Cornwall]], running on 25&amp;nbsp;kW of power. In June and July 1923, wireless transmissions were completed during nights on 97 meters from Poldhu to Marconi's yacht ''Elettra'' in the [[Cape Verde|Cape Verde Islands]].&lt;ref name="Bray"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3h7R36Y0yFUC|title=Innovation and the Communications Revolution: From the Victorian Pioneers to Broadband Internet|first=John|last=Bray|year=2002|publisher=IET|pages=73–75|isbn=9780852962183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1924, Marconi transmitted daytime and nighttime on 32 meters from Poldhu to his yacht in Beirut. Franklin went on to refine the directional transmission, by inventing the [[curtain array]] aerial system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ni7lDl3k5LwC&amp;dq=%22charles+samuel+franklin%22&amp;pg=PA234&amp;lpg=PA234&amp;q=charles+samuel+franklin|title=History of Telegraphy|first=K.

W.|last=Burns|year=1986|accessdate=2007-11-23|publisher=IET|isbn=0-86341-079-0|pages=315}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1924, Marconi entered into contracts with the British [[General Post Office]] (GPO) to install high speed shortwave telegraphy circuits from London to Australia, India, South Africa and Canada as the main element of the [[Imperial Wireless Chain]]. The UK-to-Canada shortwave "Beam Wireless Service" went into commercial operation on 25 October 1926. Beam Wireless Services from the UK to Australia, South Africa and India went into service in 1927.&lt;ref name="Bray"/&gt;

Shortwave communications began to grow rapidly in the 1920s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/beyondionosphere00unitrich/beyondionosphere00unitrich_djvu.txt |title=Full text of "Beyond the ionosphere : fifty years of satellite communication" |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; similar to the internet in the late 20th century. By 1928, more than half of long distance communications had moved from [[Submarine communications cable|transoceanic cables]] and longwave wireless services to shortwave and the overall volume of transoceanic shortwave communications had vastly increased. Shortwave stations had cost and efficiency advantages over massive longwave wireless installations,&lt;ref name="Hugill1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter J. Hugill|title=Global Communications Since 1844: Geopolitics and Technology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GjfBkup-ccMC&amp;pg=PA129|date=4 March 1999|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-6074-4|pages=129–}}&lt;/ref&gt; however some commercial longwave communications stations remained in use until the 1960s. Long distance radio circuits also reduced the load on the existing transoceanic telegraph cables and hence the need for new cables, although the cables maintained their advantages of high security and a much more reliable and better quality signal than shortwave.

The cable companies began to lose large sums of money in 1927, and a serious financial crisis threatened the viability of cable companies that were vital to strategic British interests. The British government convened the Imperial Wireless and Cable Conference&lt;ref&gt;[https://medium.com/@carcbradio/cable-companies-595de8871f6b Cable and Wireless Plc History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320053915/http://www.porthcurno.org.uk/page.php?id=104 |date=2015-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1928 "to examine the situation that had arisen as a result of the competition of Beam Wireless with the Cable Services". It recommended and received Government approval for all overseas cable and wireless resources of the Empire to be merged into one system controlled by a newly formed company in 1929, Imperial and International Communications Ltd. The name of the company was changed to [[Cable &amp; Wireless plc|Cable and Wireless Ltd.]] in 1934.

Long-distance cables had a resurgence beginning in 1956 with the laying of TAT-1 across the Atlantic Ocean, the first voice frequency cable on this route. This provided 36 high quality telephone channels and was soon followed by even higher capacity cables all around the world. These sounded the death knell of shortwave radio for commercial communications.

===Amateur use of shortwave propagation===
[[File:Dial.png|thumb|right|[[Hallicrafters SX-28]] shortwave receiver analog tuning dial, circa 1944]]
[[Amateur radio|Amateur radio operators]] also discovered that long-distance communication was possible on shortwave bands. Early long-distance services used [[surface wave]] propagation at [[Very low frequency|very low frequencies]],&lt;ref&gt;Stormfax. [http://www.stormfax.com/wireless.htm Marconi Wireless on Cape Cod]&lt;/ref&gt; which are attenuated along the path at wavelengths shorter than 1,000&amp;nbsp;meters. Longer distances and higher frequencies using this method meant more signal loss. This, and the difficulties of generating and detecting higher frequencies, made discovery of shortwave propagation difficult for commercial services.

Radio amateurs may have conducted the first successful transatlantic tests in December 1921,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radio-club-of-america.org/history.php?page=1921.html |title=1921 – Club Station 1BCG and the Transatlantic Tests |accessdate=2009-09-05 |publisher=Radio Club of America }}&lt;/ref&gt; operating in the 200&amp;nbsp;meter [[mediumwave]] band (near 1,500&amp;nbsp;kHz in the modern AM broadcast band) – the shortest wavelength then available to amateurs. In 1922 hundreds of North American amateurs were heard in Europe on 200&amp;nbsp;meters and at least 20&amp;nbsp;North American amateurs heard amateur signals from Europe. The first two-way communications between North American and Hawaiian amateurs began in 1922 at 200&amp;nbsp;meters. Although operation on wavelengths shorter than 200&amp;nbsp;meters was technically illegal (but tolerated as the authorities mistakenly believed at first that such frequencies were useless for commercial or military use), amateurs began to experiment with those wavelengths using newly available [[vacuum tube]]s shortly after World War&amp;nbsp;I.

Extreme interference at the longer edge of the 150–200&amp;nbsp;meter band – the official wavelengths allocated to [[amateur radio operators|amateurs]] by the Second National Radio Conference&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112106763342;view=1up;seq=63 |title=Radio Service Bulletin No.&amp;nbsp;72, pp.&amp;nbsp;9–13 |accessdate=2009-09-05 |date=1923-04-02 |publisher=Bureau of Navigation, Department of Commerce }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1923 – forced amateurs to shift to shorter and shorter wavelengths; however, amateurs were limited by regulation to wavelengths longer than 150&amp;nbsp;meters (2&amp;nbsp;MHz). A few fortunate amateurs who obtained special permission for experimental communications at wavelengths shorter than 150&amp;nbsp;meters completed hundreds of long distance two way contacts on 100&amp;nbsp;meters (3&amp;nbsp;MHz) in 1923 including the first transatlantic two way contacts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arrl.org/news/features/1998/1102/2/?nc=1 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091130112737/http://www.arrl.org/news/features/1998/1102/2/?nc=1 |date=November 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1924 many additional specially licensed amateurs were routinely making transoceanic contacts at distances of 6,000&amp;nbsp;miles (9,600&amp;nbsp;km) and more. On 21&amp;nbsp;September 1924 several amateurs in California completed two-way contacts with an amateur in [[New Zealand]]. On 19&amp;nbsp;October amateurs in New Zealand and England completed a 90&amp;nbsp;minute two-way contact nearly halfway around the world. On 10&amp;nbsp;October the Third National Radio Conference made three shortwave bands available to U.S. amateurs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://earlyradiohistory.us/1924conf.htm |title=Recommendations for Regulation of Radio: October&amp;nbsp;6–10, 1924 |publisher=Earlyradiohistory.us |date= |accessdate=2012-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[80-meter band|80&amp;nbsp;meters]] (3.75&amp;nbsp;MHz), [[40-meter band|40&amp;nbsp;meters]] (7&amp;nbsp;MHz) and [[20-meter band|20&amp;nbsp;meters]] (14&amp;nbsp;MHz). These were allocated worldwide, while the [[10-meter band|10&amp;nbsp;meter band]] (28&amp;nbsp;MHz) was created by the Washington International Radiotelegraph Conference&lt;ref&gt;http://www.twiar.org/aaarchives/WB008.txt&lt;/ref&gt; on 25&amp;nbsp;November 1927. The [[15-meter band|15&amp;nbsp;meter band]] (21&amp;nbsp;MHz) was opened to amateurs in the United States on 1&amp;nbsp;May 1952.

==Propagation characteristics==
[[Image:Skip Zone Example.gif|thumb|right|Formation of a [[skip zone]]]]
Shortwave radio frequency energy is capable of reaching any location on the Earth as it is influenced by [[ionospheric reflection]] back to the earth by the [[ionosphere]], (a phenomenon known as "[[skywave]] propagation"). A typical phenomenon of shortwave propagation is the occurrence of a [[skip zone]] where reception fails. With a fixed working frequency, large changes in ionospheric conditions may create skip zones at night.

As a result of the multi-layer structure of the ionosphere, propagation often simultaneously occurs on different paths,
[[Scattering|scattered]] by the E or F region and with different numbers of hops, a phenomenon that may be disturbed for certain techniques. Particularly for lower frequencies of the shortwave band, absorption of radio frequency energy in the lowest ionospheric layer, the D layer, may impose a serious limit. This is due to collisions of electrons with neutral molecules, absorbing some of a [[radio frequency]]'s energy and converting it to heat.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Rawer:"Wave Propagation in the Ionosphere". Kluwer, Dordrecht 1993 {{ISBN|0-7923-0775-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Predictions of skywave propagation depend on:
* The distance from the transmitter to the target receiver.
* Time of day.  During the day, frequencies higher than approximately 12&amp;nbsp;MHz can travel longer distances than lower ones. At night, this property is reversed.
* With lower frequencies the dependence on the time of the day is mainly due to the lowest ionospheric layer, the [[D layer|D Layer]], forming only during the day when photons from the sun break up atoms into ions and free electrons.
* Season. During the winter months of the Northern or Southern hemispheres, the AM/MW broadcast band tends to be more favorable because of longer hours of darkness.
* [[Solar flare]]s produce a large increase in D region ionization so high, sometimes for periods of several minutes, all skywave propagation is nonexistent.

==Types of modulation==
{{Further|Modulation}}
[[Image:Shortwave Radio.jpg|thumb|right|National Panasonic R3000 analog shortwave receiver, circa 1965 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shortwaveradio.ch/radio-e/panasonic-e.htm Panasonic/National] ShortwaveRadio.ch&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Several different types of [[Modulation|modulation]] are used to incorporate information in a short-wave signal.

===Audio modes===
;AM
[[Amplitude modulation]] is the simplest type and the most commonly used for [[International broadcasting|shortwave broadcasting]]. The instantaneous amplitude of the carrier is controlled by the amplitude of the signal (speech, or music, for example). At the receiver, a simple [[detector (radio)|detector]] recovers the desired modulation signal from the carrier.

;SSB
[[Single sideband]] transmission is a form of amplitude modulation but in effect filters the result of modulation. An amplitude-modulated signal has frequency components both above and below the [[carrier frequency]]. If one set of these components is eliminated as well as the residual carrier, only the remaining set is transmitted. This reduces power in the transmission, as roughly {{frac|2|3}} of the energy sent by an AM signal is in the “carrier”, which is not needed to recover the information contained in the signal. It also reduces signal bandwidth, enabling less than one-half the AM signal bandwidth to be used.

The drawback is the receiver is more complicated, since it must re-create the carrier to recover the signal. Small errors in the detection process greatly affect the pitch of the received signal. As a result, single sideband is not used for music or general broadcast. Single sideband is used for long-range voice communications by ships and aircraft, [[Citizen's Band]], and amateur radio operators. Lower sideband (LSB) is customarilly used below 9&amp;nbsp;MHz and USB (upper sideband) above 9&amp;nbsp;MHz.

;VSB
[[Vestigal sideband]] transmits the carrier and one complete sideband, but filters out the other sideband. It is a compromise between AM and SSB, enabing simple receivers to be used, but requires almost as much transmitter power as AM. One advantage is only half the bandwidth of an AM signal is used. It can be heard in the transmission of certain radio [[time signal]] stations. [[Single sideband modulation#Vestigial sideband (VSB)|Vestigial sideband]] is used for over the air Television Broadcasts both analog and [[8VSB|digital]].

;NFM
Narrow-band [[frequency modulation]] (NBFM or NFM) is used typically above 20&amp;nbsp;MHz. Because of the larger [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] required, NBFM is commonly used for [[VHF]] communication. Regulations limit the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of a signal transmitted in the HF bands, and the advantages of frequency modulation are greatest if the FM signal has a wide bandwidth. NBFM is limited to short-range transmissions due to the multiphasic distortions created by the ionosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ian Robertson |last=Sinclair |title=Audio and Hi-Fi Handbook |publisher=Newnes |year=2000 |ISBN=0-7506-4975-5 |pages=195–196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;DRM
[[Digital Radio Mondiale]] (DRM) is a digital modulation for use on bands below 30&amp;nbsp;MHz. It is a digital signal, like the data modes, below, but is for transmitting audio, like the analog modes above.

===Data modes===
;CW
[[Continuous wave]] (CW) is [[on-off keying|on-and-off keying]] of a carrier, used for [[Morse code]] communications and [[Hellschreiber]] [[facsimile]]-based [[teleprinter]] transmissions. It is a data mode, although often listed separately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Feld Hell Club |url=https://sites.google.com/site/feldhellclub/Home/feld-hell-faq |website=Google Sites |publisher=Google |accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;RTTY, FAX, SSTV
[[Radioteletype]], fax, digital, [[slow-scan television]], and other systems use forms of frequency-shift keying or audio subcarriers on a shortwave carrier. These generally require special equipment to decode, such as software on a computer equipped with a sound card.

Note that on modern computer-driven systems, digital modes are typically sent by coupling a computer's sound output to the SSB input of a radio.

==Users==
[[File:Shortwave_Radio_Dial.jpg|thumb|right|Portable shortwave receiver's digital display tuned to the [[80-meter band|75 meter band]]]]
Some established users of the shortwave radio bands may include:
* [[International broadcasting]] primarily by government-sponsored [[propaganda]], international news (for example, the [[BBC World Service]]) or cultural stations to foreign audiences: the most common use of all.
* Domestic broadcasting: to widely dispersed populations with few [[longwave]], [[mediumwave]] and FM stations serving them; or for specialty political, religious and [[alternative media]] networks; or of individual commercial and non-commercial paid broadcasts.
* Oceanic [[air traffic control]] uses the HF/shortwave band for long distance communication to aircraft over the oceans and poles, which are far beyond the range of traditional [[VHF]] frequencies. Modern systems also include satellite communications, such as ADS-C/[[CPDLC]]
* [[Utility station|"Utility" stations]] transmitting messages not intended for the general public, such as merchant shipping, marine weather, and ship-to-shore stations; for aviation weather and air-to-ground communications; for military communications; for long-distance governmental purposes, and for other non-broadcast communications.
* [[Amateur radio]] operators at the [[80-meter band|80/75]], [[60-meter band|60]], [[40-meter band|40]], [[30-meter band|30]], [[20-meter band|20]], [[17-meter band|17]], [[15-meter band|15]], [[12-meter band|12]], and [[10-meter band|10-meter]] bands. Licenses are granted by authorized government agencies.
* [[Time signal]] and [[radio clock]] stations: In North America, [[WWV (radio station)|WWV radio]] and [[WWVH|WWVH radio]] transmit at these frequencies: 2.5&amp;nbsp;MHz, 5&amp;nbsp;MHz, 10&amp;nbsp;MHz, and 15&amp;nbsp;MHz; and WWV also transmits on 20&amp;nbsp;MHz. The [[CHU (radio station)|CHU radio station]] in Canada transmits on the following frequencies: 3.33&amp;nbsp;MHz, 7.85&amp;nbsp;MHz, and 14.67&amp;nbsp;MHz. Other similar [[radio clock]] stations transmit on various shortwave and longwave frequencies around the world. The shortwave transmissions are primarily intended for human reception, while the longwave stations are generally used for automatic synchronization of watches and clocks.

Sporadic or non-traditional users of the shortwave bands may include:
* [[Clandestine radio|Clandestine stations]]. These are stations that broadcast on behalf of various political movements such as rebel or insurrectionist forces. They may advocate civil war, insurrection, rebellion against the government-in-charge of the country to which they are directed. Clandestine broadcasts may emanate from transmitters located in rebel-controlled territory or from outside the country entirely, using another country's transmission facilities.&lt;ref name="Sterling2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher H. Sterling|title=Encyclopedia of Radio 3-Volume Set|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-UeveLMilioC&amp;pg=PA538|date=March 2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-45649-8|pages=538–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Numbers Station]]s. These stations regularly appear and disappear all over the shortwave radio band but are unlicensed and untraceable. It is believed that Numbers Stations are operated by government agencies and are used to communicate with clandestine operatives working within foreign countries. However, no definitive proof of such use has emerged. Because the vast majority of these broadcasts contain nothing but the recitation of blocks of numbers, in various languages, with occasional bursts of music, they have become known colloquially as "Number Stations". Perhaps the most noted Number Station is the [[Lincolnshire Poacher (numbers station)|"Lincolnshire Poacher"]], named after the 18th century English folk song, which is transmitted just before the sequences of numbers.
* Unlicensed [[two way radio]] activity by individuals such as taxi drivers, bus drivers and fishermen in various countries can be heard on various shortwave frequencies. Such unlicensed transmissions by "pirate" or "bootleg" two way radio operators&lt;ref name="Magazines1940"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hearst Magazines|title=Popular Mechanics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3tkDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA62|date=January 1940|publisher=Hearst Magazines|pages=62–}}&lt;/ref&gt; can often cause [[Co-channel interference|signal interference]] to licensed stations.&lt;ref name="IARU"&gt;{{cite web|title=IARU Monitoring System|url=http://www.iaru.org/monitoring-system.html|website=iaru.org|publisher=International Amateur Radio Union (IARU)|accessdate=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pirate radio]] broadcasters who feature programming such as music, talk and other entertainment, can be heard sporadically and in various modes on the shortwave bands.&lt;ref name="Yoder2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew R.

===Frequency allocations===
{{Main|Shortwave bands}}
The [[World Radiocommunication Conference]] (WRC), organized under the auspices of the [[International Telecommunication Union]], allocates bands for various services in conferences every few years. The last WRC took place in 2007.

At WRC-97 in 1997, the following bands were allocated for [[international broadcasting]]. AM shortwave broadcasting channels are allocated with a 5&amp;nbsp;kHz separation for traditional analog audio broadcasting.

Although countries generally follow the table above, there may be small differences between countries or regions. For example, in the official bandplan of the [[Netherlands]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/frequentiebeleid/documenten-en-publicaties/rapporten/2007/01/18/nationaal-frequentieplan-nfp.html|title=Nationaal Frequentieplan|author=|date=|website=rijksoverheid.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 49 m band starts at 5.95&amp;nbsp;MHz, the 41 m band ends at 7.45&amp;nbsp;MHz, the 11 m band starts at 25.67&amp;nbsp;MHz, and the 120, 90 and 60 m bands are absent altogether. Additionally, international broadcasters sometimes operate outside the normal WRC-allocated bands or use off-channel frequencies. This is done for practical reasons, or to attract attention in crowded bands (60m, 49m, 40m, 41m, 31m, 25m).

The new [[digital audio broadcasting]] format for shortwave [[Digital Radio Mondiale|DRM]] operates 10&amp;nbsp;kHz or 20&amp;nbsp;kHz channels. There are some ongoing discussions with respect to specific band allocation for DRM, as it mainly transmitted in 10&amp;nbsp;kHz format.

The power used by shortwave transmitters ranges from less than one watt for some experimental and amateur radio transmissions to 500 kilowatts and higher for intercontinental broadcasters and [[over-the-horizon radar]]. Shortwave transmitting centers often use specialized [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] designs (like the [[ALLISS]] antenna technology) to concentrate radio energy at the target area.

===Advantages===
[[File:Soviet SWL URS3-108-B.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Soviet union|Soviet]] shortwave listener in [[Borisoglebsk]], 1941]]
Shortwave does possess a number of advantages over newer technologies, including the following:
* Difficulty of censoring programming by authorities in restrictive countries: unlike their relative ease in monitoring the Internet, government authorities face technical difficulties monitoring which stations (sites) are being listened to (accessed). For example, during the attempted coup against Soviet President [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], when his access to communications was limited (e.g. his phones were cut off, etc.), Gorbachev was able to stay informed by means of the [[BBC World Service]] on shortwave.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.w4uvh.net/dxld7078.txt&lt;/ref&gt;
* Low-cost shortwave radios are widely available in all but the most repressive countries in the world. Simple shortwave [[regenerative receiver]]s can be easily built with a few parts.
* In many countries (particularly in most developing nations and in the [[Eastern bloc]] during the [[Cold War]] era) ownership of shortwave receivers has been and continues to be widespread&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Habrat| first = Marek| title = Odbiornik "Roksana" (Radio constructor's recollections)| url=http://oldradio.pl/karta_odb.php?nrmod=471| accessdate = 2008-08-05| postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; (in many of these countries some domestic stations also used shortwave).
* Many newer shortwave receivers are portable and can be battery-operated, making them useful in difficult circumstances. Newer technology includes [[hand-cranked radio]]s which provide power without batteries.
* Shortwave radios can be used in situations where [[Internet]] or [[satellite communications]] service is temporarily or long-term unavailable (or unaffordable).
* Shortwave radio travels much farther than broadcast FM (88–108&amp;nbsp;MHz). Shortwave broadcasts can be easily transmitted over a distance of several thousands of kilometers, including from one continent to another.
* Particularly in tropical regions, SW is somewhat less prone to interference from [[thunderstorms]] than [[medium wave|medium wave radio]], and is able to cover a large geographic area with relatively low power (and hence cost). Therefore, in many of these countries it is widely used for domestic broadcasting.
* Very little infrastructure is required for long-distance two-way communications using shortwave radio. All one needs is a pair of transceivers, each with an antenna, and a source of energy (such as a battery, a portable generator, or the electrical grid). This makes shortwave radio one of the most robust means of communications, which can be disrupted only by interference or bad ionospheric conditions. Modern digital transmission modes such as [[MFSK]] and [[Olivia MFSK|Olivia]] are even more robust, allowing successful reception of signals well below the [[noise floor]] of a conventional receiver.

===Disadvantages===
Shortwave radio's benefits are sometimes regarded as being outweighed by its drawbacks, including:
* In most Western countries, shortwave radio ownership is usually limited to true enthusiasts, since most new standard radios do not receive the shortwave band. Therefore, Western audiences are limited.
* In the developed world, shortwave reception is very difficult in urban areas because of excessive noise from [[Switched-mode power supply|switched-mode]] power adapters, fluorescent or LED light sources, internet modems and routers, computers and many other sources of [[radio interference]].

The Asia-Pacific Telecommunity estimates that there are approximately 600 million [[Shortwave receiver|shortwave broadcast-radio receivers]] in use in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aptsec.org/meetings/2002/apg2003-4/(56)ABU.doc ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050210001613/http://www.aptsec.org/meetings/2002/apg2003-4/(56)ABU.doc |date=February 10, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[WWCR]] claims that there are 1.5 billion shortwave receivers worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Arlyn T.

Many hobbyists listen to shortwave broadcasters. In some cases, the goal is to hear as many stations from as many countries as possible ''([[DXing]])''; others listen to specialized shortwave utility, or "ute", transmissions such as maritime, naval, aviation, or military signals. Others focus on intelligence signals from [[numbers stations]], stations which transmit strange broadcast usually for intelligence operations, or the two way communications by amateur radio operators. Some short wave listeners behave analogously to "lurkers" on the Internet, in that they listen only and never make any attempt to send out their own signals.  Other listeners participate in clubs, or actively send and receive QSL cards, or become involved with amateur radio and start transmitting on their own.

Many listeners tune the shortwave bands for the programmes of stations broadcasting to a general audience (such as [[Radio Taiwan International]], [[China Radio International]], [[Voice of America]], [[Radio France Internationale]], [[BBC World Service]], [[Voice of Korea]], [[Radio Free Sarawak]] etc.). Today, through the evolution of the Internet, the hobbyist can listen to shortwave signals via remotely controlled or web controlled shortwave receivers around the world, even without owning a shortwave radio.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dxing.com/webclink.htm Web-Controlled Radios] DXing.com&lt;/ref&gt; Many international broadcasters offer live streaming audio on their websites and a number have closed their shortwave service entirely, or severely curtailed it, in favour of internet transmission.

Shortwave listeners, or SWLs, can obtain [[QSL card]]s from broadcasters, utility stations or amateur radio operators as trophies of the hobby. Some stations even give out special certificates, pennants, stickers and other tokens and promotional materials to shortwave listeners.

==Shortwave broadcasts and music==
[[File:Stockhausen 1994 WDR.jpg|thumb|right|Composer [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]]]]
Some musicians have been attracted to the unique aural characteristics of shortwave radio which—due to the nature of amplitude modulation, varying propagation conditions, and the presence of interference—generally has lower fidelity than local broadcasts (particularly via FM stations). Shortwave transmissions often have bursts of distortion, and "hollow" sounding loss of clarity at certain aural frequencies, altering the harmonics of natural sound and creating at times a strange "spacey" quality due to echoes and phase distortion.  Evocations of shortwave reception distortions have been incorporated into rock and classical compositions, by means of delays or feedback loops, equalizers, or even playing shortwave radios as live instruments.  Snippets of broadcasts have been mixed into electronic sound collages and live musical instruments, by means of analogue [[tape loop]]s or [[digital sampler|digital samples]].  Sometimes the sounds of instruments and existing musical recordings are altered by remixing or equalizing, with various distortions added, to replicate the garbled effects of shortwave radio reception.&lt;ref name="Wörner1973"&gt;{{cite book|author=Karl Heinrich Wörner|title=Stockhausen; Life and Work|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aqmMPnlXZOMC&amp;pg=PA76|year=1973|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-02143-3|pages=76–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sheppard2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Sheppard|title=On Some Faraway Beach: The Life and Times of Brian Eno|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rZluAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA275|date=1 May 2009|publisher=Chicago Review Press|isbn=978-1-55652-107-2|pages=275–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wire&gt;{{cite book|title=The Wire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zB5MAAAAYAAJ|year=2000|publisher=C. Parker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first attempts by serious composers to incorporate radio effects into music may be those of the Russian physicist and musician [[Léon Theremin]],&lt;ref name=Wire /&gt; who perfected a form of radio oscillator as a musical instrument in 1928 ([[regenerative circuit]]s in radios of the time were prone to breaking into [[oscillation]], adding various tonal [[harmonics]] to music and speech); and in the same year, the development of a French instrument called the [[Ondes Martenot]] by its inventor [[Maurice Martenot]], a French cellist and former wireless telegrapher. [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] used shortwave radio and effects in works including ''[[Hymnen]]'' (1966–67), ''[[Kurzwellen]]'' (1968)—adapted for the Beethoven Bicentennial in ''Opus 1970'' with filtered and distorted snippets of Beethoven pieces—''[[Spiral (Stockhausen)|Spiral]]'' (1968), ''[[Pole (Stockhausen)|Pole]]'', ''[[Expo (Stockhausen)|Expo]]'' (both 1969–70), and ''[[Licht#Wednesday|Michaelion]]'' (1997).&lt;ref name="Wörner1973" /&gt;

[[Cyprus|Cypriot]] composer [[Yannis Kyriakides]] incorporated shortwave [[numbers station]] transmissions in his 1999 ''ConSPIracy cantata''.&lt;ref name="Dolp2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Laura Dolp|title=Arvo Pärt's White Light|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l8wnDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA83|date=13 July 2017|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-18289-9|pages=83–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Holger Czukay]], a student of Stockhausen, was one of the first to use shortwave in a [[rock music]] context.&lt;ref name="Sheppard2009" /&gt; In 1975, German [[electronic music]] band [[Kraftwerk]] recorded a full length [[concept album]] around simulated radiowave and shortwave sounds, entitled ''[[Radioactivity (album)|Radio-Activity]]''.&lt;ref name="Barr2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tim Barr|title=Kraftwerk: from Dusseldorf to the Future With Love|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0mcj4h2qEhQC&amp;pg=PT98|date=31 August 2013|publisher=Ebury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4481-7776-9|pages=98–}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The The]]'s Radio Cineola monthly broadcasts drew heavily on shortwave radio sound.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thethe.com/sections/radio.php Radio Cineola] www.thethe.com {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111218173001/http://www.thethe.com/sections/radio.php |date=December 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shortwave's future==
[[File:Penny Mercury.jpg|thumb|right|PC spectrum display of a modern [[software defined radio|software defined]] shortwave receiver]]
{{Further|Shortwave listening#Future of shortwave listening}}

The development of direct broadcasts from satellites has reduced the demand for shortwave receiver hardware, but there are still a great number of shortwave broadcasters. A new [[digital radio]] technology, [[Digital Radio Mondiale]] (DRM), is expected to improve the quality of shortwave audio from very poor to standards comparable to the FM broadcast band.&lt;ref name="RW" /&gt; The future of shortwave radio is threatened by the rise of [[power line communication]] (PLC), also known as [[Broadband over Power Lines]] (BPL), which uses a data stream transmitted over unshielded power lines. As the BPL frequencies used overlap with shortwave bands, severe distortions can make listening to analog shortwave radio signals near power lines difficult or impossible.&lt;ref name="HrasnicaHaidine2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Halid Hrasnica|author2=Abdelfatteh Haidine|author3=Ralf Lehnert|title=Broadband Powerline Communications: Network Design|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d270N6yvWCoC&amp;pg=PA34|date=14 January 2005|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-85742-7|pages=34–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experts disagree on the future of shortwave. According to Andy Sennitt, former editor of the [[World Radio TV Handbook]], “shortwave is a legacy technology, which is expensive and environmentally unfriendly. A few countries are hanging on to it, but most have faced up to the fact that the glory days of shortwave have gone. Religious broadcasters will still use it because they are not too concerned with listening figures".&lt;ref name="RW" /&gt;

However Thomas Witherspoon, editor of shortwave news site SWLingPost.com wrote that “shortwave remains the most accessible international communications medium that still provides listeners with the protection of complete anonymity". According to Nigel Fry, head of Distribution for the [[BBC World Service]] Group, “I still see a place for shortwave in the 21st century, especially for reaching areas of the world that are prone to natural disasters that destroy local broadcasting and Internet infrastructure".&lt;ref name="RW"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Careless|first1=James|title=The Evolution of Shortwave Radio|url=http://www.radioworld.com/digital-radio/0014/the-evolution-of-shortwave-radio/338422|website=Radio World|publisher=NewBay Media|accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{H5N1}}
:''See [[Influenza pandemic]] for government preparation for an H5N1 pandemic''
The '''social impact of H5N1''' is the effect or influence of [[H5N1]] in human society; especially the financial, political, social, and personal responses to both actual and predicted deaths in birds, humans, and other animals. Billions of dollars are being raised and spent to research H5N1 and prepare for a potential [[avian influenza]] pandemic. Over ten billion dollars have been lost and over two hundred million birds have been killed to try to contain H5N1. People have reacted by buying less chicken causing poultry sales and prices to fall. Many individuals have stockpiled supplies for a possible flu pandemic.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

==Financial==
On November 1, 2005 President George W. Bush unveiled the National Strategy To Safeguard Against The Danger of Pandemic Influenza&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/homeland/pandemic-influenza.html Whitehouse.gov] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109011356/http://www.whitehouse.gov/homeland/pandemic-influenza.html |date=2009-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; backed by a request to Congress for $7.1 billion to begin implementing the plan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://usinfo.state.gov/gi/Archive/2005/Nov/01-432345.html State.gov] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060914184240/http://usinfo.state.gov/gi/Archive/2005/Nov/01-432345.html |date=2006-09-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 18, 2006 donor nations pledged two billion US dollars to combat bird flu at the two-day International Pledging Conference on Avian and Human Influenza held in China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/jan2006/2006-01-18-02.asp Newswire]&lt;/ref&gt; Over ten billion dollars have been spent and over two hundred million birds have been killed to try to contain H5N1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://msnbc.msn.com/id/12033509/ MSNBC] [http://www.usaid.gov/about_usaid/acvfa/intro_ai.pdf US AID] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080815071811/http://www.usaid.gov/about_usaid/acvfa/intro_ai.pdf |date=2008-08-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', due to the H5N1 threat, as of March 2006: "governments worldwide have spent billions planning for a potential influenza pandemic: buying medicines, running disaster drills, [and] developing strategies for tighter border controls."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/16/business/16bird.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin NYT]&lt;/ref&gt;

Investment strategies are being altered to manage the effects of H5N1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.bmo.com/news/article/0,1257,contentCode-4922_divId-4_langId-1_navCode-112,00.html BMO Financial Group]&lt;/ref&gt; This changes the valuations of trillions of dollars' worth of stocks worldwide as investors move assets in accordance with both fears and hopes.

Poultry farming practices have changed due to H5N1:
*killing millions of poultry
*[[Vaccination|vaccinating]] poultry against bird flu
*vaccinating poultry workers against [[human flu]]
*limiting travel in areas where H5N1 is found
*increasing farm hygiene
*reducing contact between [[livestock]] and wild birds
*reducing open-air [[wet market]]s
*limiting workers contact with [[Cockfight|cock fighting]]
*reducing purchases of live fowl
*improving veterinary [[vaccine]] availability and cost.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfr.org/pub8198/laurie_garrett_anthony_s_fauci_michael_osterholm_rita_colwell/the_threat_of_global_pandemics.php Council on Foreign Relations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013053617/http://www.cfr.org/pub8198/laurie_garrett_anthony_s_fauci_michael_osterholm_rita_colwell/the_threat_of_global_pandemics.php |date=2008-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, after nearly two years of using mainly culling to control the virus, the [[Vietnam]] government in 2005 adopted a combination of mass poultry vaccination, disinfecting, culling, information campaigns and bans on live poultry in cities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=worldNews&amp;storyID=2006-04-28T080147Z_01_HAN5054_RTRUKOC_0_UK-BIRDFLU-VIETNAM.xml Reuters]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} article ''Vietnam to unveil advanced plan to fight bird flu'' published on April 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost of poultry farming has increased, while the cost to consumers has gone down due to fears from H5N1 driving demand below supply, resulting in devastating losses for many poultry farmers. Poor poultry farmers can't afford mandated measures keeping their bird livestock from contact with wild birds (and other measures) thus risking losing their livelihood altogether. Multinational poultry farming is increasingly becoming a profit loser as H5N1 achieves status as endemic in wild birds worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/IRIN/a13fd43bc74b6209dc90f6d849ffa45b.htm Poultry sector suffers despite absence of bird flu]&lt;/ref&gt;

Financial ruin for poor poultry farmers, that can be as severe as threatening starvation, has caused some to commit suicide and many others to stop cooperating with efforts to deal with H5N1; further increasing the human toll, the spread of the disease and the chances for a pandemic mutation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/BKK260524.htm Reuters] article ''Cambodian ostracised for reporting bird flu'' published on April 12, 2006.

==Political==
[[United States Department of Health and Human Services|US HHS]] Secretary [[Michael O. Leavitt]] has said "Everything you say in advance of a [[pandemic]] is [[alarmist]]; anything you do after it starts is inadequate."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.richmond.com/health/output.aspx?Article_ID=4179051&amp;Vertical_ID=127&amp;tier=1&amp;position=5 |title=Virginia Pandemic Influenza Summit informs community partners about pandemic influenza plans at the national and state level |access-date=2006-03-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926213521/http://www.richmond.com/health/output.aspx?Article_ID=4179051&amp;Vertical_ID=127&amp;tier=1&amp;position=5 |archive-date=2007-09-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

H5N1, like everything else, is subject to [[spin (public relations)|political spin]]; wherein every interest group picks and chooses among the facts to support their favorite cause resulting in a distortion of the overall picture, the motivations of the people involved and the believability of the predictions.

[[Donald Rumsfeld]], formerly [[United States Secretary of Defense]], is a past board member and current minor shareholder of [[Gilead Sciences]] which owns [[intellectual property rights]] to [[Oseltamivir]] (also called "Tamiflu"). In November 2005, George W. Bush urged Congress to pass 7.1 billion in emergency funding to prepare for the possible bird flu pandemic, of which one billion is solely dedicated to the purchase, and distribution of Tamiflu.

Some believe ''The deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu is essentially a problem of industrial poultry practices.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grain.org/briefings/?id=194 Grain international, non-profit foundation] [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4721598.stm BBC news] [http://cnn.netscape.cnn.com/news/story.jsp?id=2006032808270002118201&amp;dt=20060328082700&amp;w=RTR&amp;coview= CNN] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616201320/http://cnn.netscape.cnn.com/news/story.jsp?id=2006032808270002118201&amp;dt=20060328082700&amp;w=RTR&amp;coview= |date=2006-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have a more nuanced position. According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] article ''H5N1 Outbreaks and Enzootic Influenza'' by [[Robert G. Webster]] et al.:"Transmission of highly pathogenic H5N1 from domestic poultry back to migratory waterfowl in western China has increased the geographic spread. The spread of H5N1 and its likely reintroduction to domestic poultry increase the need for good agricultural vaccines. In fact, the root cause of the continuing H5N1 pandemic threat may be the way the pathogenicity of H5N1 viruses is masked by cocirculating influenza viruses or bad agricultural vaccines."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol12no01/05-1024.htm CDC] ''H5N1 Outbreaks and Enzootic Influenza'' by [[Robert G. Webster]] et al.&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Robert Webster explains: "If you use a good vaccine you can prevent the transmission within poultry and to humans. But if they have been using vaccines now [in China] for several years, why is there so much bird flu? There is bad vaccine that stops the disease in the bird but the bird goes on pooping out virus and maintaining it and changing it. And I think this is what is going on in China. It has to be. Either there is not enough vaccine being used or there is substandard vaccine being used. Probably both. It's not just China. We can't blame China for substandard vaccines. I think there are substandard vaccines for influenza in poultry all over the world."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10639567/ MSNBC quoting Reuters quoting Robert G. Webster]&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the same concerns, Reuters reports Hong Kong infectious disease expert Lo Wing-lok saying that "The issue of vaccines has to take top priority", and Julie Hall, in charge of the WHO's outbreak response in China, saying that China's vaccinations could be "masking" the virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/HKG28205.htm |title=China H5N1 outbreak puts vaccines under spotlight |date=17 March 2006 |access-date= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060318225839/http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/HKG28205.htm |archive-date=18 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC reported that Dr Wendy Barclay, a virologist at the University of Reading, UK said: "The Chinese have made a vaccine based on reverse genetics made with H5N1 antigens, and they have been using it. There has been a lot of criticism of what they have done, because they have protected their chickens against death from this virus but the chickens still get infected; and then you get drift - the virus mutates in response to the antibodies - and now we have a situation where we have five or six 'flavours' of H5N1 out there."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4737276.stm BBC] ''Bird flu vaccine no silver bullet'' February 22, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have called for tax breaks due to H5N1. A May 7, 2006 report from India E-News states that: "Pakistani poultry farmers have sought a 10-year tax exemption to support their dwindling business after the detection of the H5N1 strain of bird flu triggered a fall in demand and prices, a poultry trader said. "We have asked the government to give us tax exemption on income from the poultry business for at least 10 years to meet losses caused by the bird flu scare", Abdul Basit told DPA. Basit, vice president of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) in the country's commercial hub of Lahore, was part of a delegation of the Pakistan Poultry Association, which met food ministry officials to present their demand. The federal poultry board of the food ministry is to meet on May 9 to consider the tax-cut demand for the poultry business in the upcoming national budget due in mid-June."&lt;ref&gt;[http://indiaenews.com/2006-05/6960-pakistani-poultry-demands-10-year-tax-holiday.htm India eNews] article ''Pakistani poultry industry demands 10-year tax holiday'' published May 7, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social==
[[Reuters]] reported that [[WHO]] expert Hassan al-Bushra said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Even now, we remain unsure about [[Tamiflu]]'s real effectiveness. As for a vaccine, work cannot start on it until the emergence of a new virus, and we predict it would take six to nine months to develop it. For the moment, we cannot by any means count on a potential vaccine to prevent the spread of a contagious influenza virus, whose various precedents in the past 90 years have been highly pathogenic. However, it is crucial that countries in the Middle East invest and start developing their own research and technical facilities, where they can produce their own drugs when the time comes rather than wait to import expensive medicines from abroad at the risk of their population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/IRIN/e83d17668fc60eb55518a76c1de858fd.htm Reuters article ''MIDDLE EAST: Interview with WHO experts Hassan al-Bushra and John Jabbour''] 2 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If a pandemic occurs, local response will be more important than national or international response, as every community will have its own resources swamped dealing with its own problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.richmond.com/health/output.aspx?Article_ID=4179051&amp;Vertical_ID=127&amp;tier=1&amp;position=5 |title="Any community that fails to prepare with the expectation the federal government will come to the rescue will be tragically wrong." - US HHS |access-date=2006-03-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926213521/http://www.richmond.com/health/output.aspx?Article_ID=4179051&amp;Vertical_ID=127&amp;tier=1&amp;position=5 |archive-date=2007-09-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; International groups, nations, local governments, corporations, schools, and groups of all kinds have made plans and run drills to prepare for an H5N1 pandemic.

Online avian flu forums have received increasing attention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avianflutalk.com/ Avian flu forum]&lt;/ref&gt; Self-help groups have organized to provide news and information about resources, aid and relief efforts in preparation for avian flu.&lt;ref&gt;[http://avianfluhelp.blogspot.com/ Avian flu help]&lt;/ref&gt;

British reports warn that in response to an [[influenza pandemic]] local groups will not be able to rely on the armed forces, widespread infection could occur in days not months, an effective vaccine can not be counted on, and the huge death toll could swamp mortuaries so "A key point for local planning is likely to be the identification of potential sites for the location of facilities for the temporary storage of bodies".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.scotsman.com/health.cfm?id=508792006 Scotsman News] Report on leaked British study.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal==
Many individuals have stockpiled supplies (Tamiflu, food, water, etc.) for a possible flu pandemic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Many+individuals+have+stockpiled+supplies+%28Tamiflu%2C+food%2C+water%2C+etc%29+for+a+possible+flu+pandemic.&amp;btnG=Google+Search]&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals have started web sites and companies using interest and ignorance in H5N1 to sell information, cures, and advertising space. Some even use concern over H5N1 to find victims for their [[malware]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/03/27/spyware_diy/ The Register] article "S'kiddies get into spyware for just $15" by John Leyden published March 27, 2006 accessed February 28, 2007 says "Spam samples trapped by internet security firm Sophos use newsworthy topics to lure unwary users. One presents itself as a warning about the deadly H5N1 bird flu virus, providing links to the bogus website, purporting to offer health advice. [...] Surfers visiting these websites will find themselves exposed to JavaScript code that attempts to take advantage of known web browser and Windows vulnerabilities to download malware."&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant effect of H5N1 has been personal fear concerning the unknown, even by those most in-the-know. Dr. [[David Nabarro]], chief avian flu coordinator for the United Nations, describes himself as "quite scared"; says avian flu has too many unanswered questions; and if the disease starts spreading to humans, borders will close, airports will shut down, and travelers everywhere will be stranded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/03/27/news/worrier.php NYT article picked up by IHT]&lt;/ref&gt; With evaluations of the threat ranging from those who say it is a hoax to those who warn of billions of humans dying, uncertainty and fear motivate personal behaviors around the world affecting many people even before the threat becomes reality.

==Pop culture==

The 1998 chart-topping hit song "[[One Week (song)|One Week]]" by [[Barenaked Ladies]] includes the lines "Chickity China the Chinese chicken / Have a drumstick and your brain stops tickin'", a reference to the outbreaks of H5N1 in Hong Kong around the time the song was written.

==Compared to annual flu season==
{{main|Flu season}}
The annual flu season deaths and costs caused by viruses other than H5N1 provide a point of contrast - something to compare against. According to the United States Government, the annual flu in the United States:
&lt;blockquote&gt;results in approximately 36,000 deaths and more than 200,000 hospitalizations each year. In addition to this human toll, influenza is annually responsible for a total cost of over $10 billion in the United States. A pandemic, or worldwide outbreak of a new influenza virus, could dwarf this impact by overwhelming our health and medical capabilities, potentially resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths, millions of hospitalizations, and hundreds of billions of dollars in direct and indirect costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/homeland/pandemic-influenza.html Message from President Bush] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109011356/http://www.whitehouse.gov/homeland/pandemic-influenza.html |date=2009-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' reported that: "A study by the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the consequences of a severe pandemic could, in the United States, include 200 million people infected, 90 million clinically ill, and 2 million dead. The study estimates that 30 percent of all workers would become ill and 2.5 percent would die, with 30 percent of workers missing a mean of three weeks of work — resulting in a decrease in the gross domestic product of 5 percent. Furthermore, 18 million to 45 million people would require outpatient care, and economic costs would total approximately $675 billion."&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/354/13/1411 New England Journal of Medicine] Volume 354:1411-1413 - March 30, 2006 - Number 13 - ''Vaccines against Avian Influenza — A Race against Time''&lt;/ref&gt; One study concludes that a pandemic that reduced the available dock workers by 28% would cut the throughput capacity for containers arriving at American ports on the West coast by 45%.&lt;ref&gt;Pandemic influenza, worker absenteeism and impacts on freight transportation | From Proc 41st Hawaii Intl Conf Syst Sci, published online Apr 9 {{cite web |url=http://www.wpro.who.int/NR/rdonlyres/FD4AC2FD-B7C8-4A13-A32C-6CF328A0C036/0/Slide4.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119194526/http://www.wpro.who.int/NR/rdonlyres/FD4AC2FD-B7C8-4A13-A32C-6CF328A0C036/0/Slide4.jpg |archivedate=2008-11-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Debris-GEO1280.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=Earth from space, surrounded by small white dots|A computer-generated image representing space debris as could be seen from [[high Earth orbit]]. The two main debris fields are the ring of objects in [[geosynchronous orbit|geosynchronous Earth orbit]] (GEO) and the cloud of objects in [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO).]]

Initially, the term '''space debris''' referred to the natural debris found in the solar system: [[asteroid]]s, [[comet]]s, and [[meteoroid]]s. However, with the 1979 beginning of the NASA Orbital Debris Program,&lt;ref&gt;[https://orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/ NASA Orbital Debris Program]&lt;/ref&gt; the term also refers to the debris (alt. '''space waste''' or '''space garbage''') from the mass of defunct, artificially created objects in space, especially [[Geocentric orbit|Earth orbit]]. These include old [[satellite]]s and spent [[rocket stage]]s, as well as the fragments from their disintegration and [[collision]]s. 

As of December 2016, five [[satellite collision]]s have generated space debris.{{cn|date=August 2018}}  Space debris is also known as ''orbital debris'', ''space junk'', ''space waste'', ''space trash'', ''space litter'' or ''space garbage''.&lt;ref&gt;  [http://www.spaceacademy.net.au/watch/debris/debris.htm GUIDE TO SPACE DEBRIS from the spaceacademy.net.au]&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrieved 6 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Collisions with debris have become a hazard to spacecraft; they cause damage akin to [[sandblasting]], especially to solar panels and optics like telescopes or [[star tracker]]s that cannot be covered with a [[hypervelocity ballistic shield|ballistic]] [[Whipple shield]] (unless it is transparent).&lt;ref name=nasa20090428&gt;

The [[Kessler syndrome]], a runaway [[chain reaction]] of collisions exponentially increasing the amount of debris, has been hypothesized to ensue beyond a critical density. This could affect useful polar-orbiting bands, increases the cost of protection for spacecraft missions and could destroy live satellites. Whether Kessler syndrome is already underway has been debated.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Grossman, [https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/tag/kessler-syndrome/ "NASA Considers Shooting Space Junk with Lasers"], ''wired'', 15 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The measurement, mitigation, and potential removal of debris are conducted by some participants in the [[space industry]].

== Characterization ==

=== {{anchor|Large vs. small}}Size ===
There are estimated to be over 51 million pieces of debris smaller than {{convert|1|cm|abbr=on}} as of July 2013. There are approximately 670,000 pieces from one to ten cm. The current count of large debris (defined as 10&amp;nbsp;cm across or larger&lt;ref name="technasa"&gt;[http://www.orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/library/UN_Report_on_Space_Debris99.pdf "Technical report on space debris"], p. 15, United Nations, New York, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;) is 29,000.&lt;ref name="esadebris2013"/&gt; The technical measurement cutoff is c. {{convert|3|mm|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="nasadebris2012"&gt;[http://orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/faqs.html#3 "Orbital Debris FAQ: How much orbital debris is currently in Earth orbit?"] ''NASA'', March 2012. Retrieved 31 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Over 98 percent of the 1,900 tons of debris in low Earth orbit (as of 2002) was accounted for by about 1,500 objects, each over {{convert|100|kg|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Carroll, [http://www.niac.usra.edu/files/studies/final_report/800Carroll.pdf "Space Transport Development Using Orbital Debris"], NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts, 2 December 2002, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Total mass is mostly constant despite addition of many smaller objects, since they reenter the atmosphere sooner. Using a 2008 figure of 8,500 known items, it is estimated at {{convert|5500|t|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Robin McKie and Michael Day, [https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/feb/24/spaceexplorationspacejunk "Warning of catastrophe from mass of 'space junk'"] ''The Observer'', 24 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== {{anchor|Debris in LEO}}Low Earth orbit (LEO) ===
[[File:Space Junk.jpg|thumb|alt=Earth from space, with space debris enhanced|Space debris in LEO, with sizes exaggerated]]

In LEO there are few "universal orbits" which keep spacecraft in particular rings (in contrast to GEO, a single widely used orbit). The closest are [[sun-synchronous orbit]]s that keep a constant angle between the Sun and the [[Orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]]; they are [[Polar orbit|polar]], meaning they cross over the polar regions. LEO satellites orbit in many planes, up to 15 times a day, causing frequent approaches between objects (the density of objects is much higher in LEO).&lt;ref&gt;Matt Ford, [https://arstechnica.com/science/news/2009/02/orbiting-space-junk-heightens-risk-of-satellite-catastrophes.ars "Orbiting space junk heightens risk of satellite catastrophes."] ''Ars Technica'', 27 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Orbits are further changed by [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbations]] (which in LEO include unevenness of the Earth's gravitational field), and collisions can occur from any direction. For these reasons, the Kessler syndrome applies mostly to the LEO region; impacts occur at up to 16&amp;nbsp;km/s (twice the [[orbital speed]]) if head-on – the [[2009 satellite collision]] occurred at 11.7&amp;nbsp;km/s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/esaMI/Space_Debris/1112600510257_0.html "What are hypervelocity impacts?"] ''ESA'', 19 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; creating much [[spall]] in the critical size range. These can cross other orbits and lead to a cascade effect. A large-enough collision (e.g. between a space station and a defunct satellite) could make [[low Earth orbit]] impassable.&lt;ref name="k09"&gt;{{cite web |  url = http://webpages.charter.net/dkessler/files/KesSym.html |  title = The Kessler Syndrome |  date = 8 March 2009 |  author = Donald J. Kessler |  access-date = 22 September 2009 |  archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100527195029/http://webpages.charter.net/dkessler/files/KesSym.html |  archive-date = 27 May 2010 |  dead-url = yes |  df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manned missions are mostly at {{convert|400|km|abbr=on}} and below, where air drag helps clear zones of fragments. Atmospheric expansion as a result of [[space weather]] raises the critical altitude by increasing drag; in the 90s, it was a factor in reduced debris density.&lt;ref name=k9165 /&gt; Another was fewer launches by Russia; the USSR made most of their launches in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref name=k7&gt;Klinkrad, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== {{anchor|Debris at higher altitudes}}Higher altitudes ===
At higher altitudes, where air drag is less significant, orbital decay takes longer. Slight [[Drag (physics)|atmospheric drag]], [[Lunar theory|lunar perturbations]], Earth's gravity perturbations, [[solar wind]] and solar [[radiation pressure]] can gradually bring debris down to lower altitudes (where it decays), but at very high altitudes this may take millennia.&lt;ref name=kam68&gt;Kessler 1991, p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt; Although high-altitude orbits are less commonly used than LEO and the onset of the problem is slower, the numbers progress toward the critical threshold more quickly.{{contradict-inline|date=December 2015}}{{page needed|date=December 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| bibcode=2005ESASP.587..113S | title=Optical observation of space debris in high-altitude orbits | journal=Proceedings of the 4th European Conference on Space Debris (ESA SP-587). 18–20 April 2005 | volume=587 | page=113 | author1=Schildknecht | first1=T. | last2=Musci | first2=R. | last3=Flury | first3=W. | last4=Kuusela | first4=J. | last5=De Leon | first5=J. | last6=Dominguez Palmero | first6=L. De Fatima | year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many communications satellites are in [[geostationary orbit]]s (GEO), clustering over specific targets and sharing the same orbital path. Although velocities are low between GEO objects, when a satellite becomes derelict (such as [[Telstar 401]]) it assumes a [[geosynchronous orbit]]; its [[orbital inclination]] increases about .8° and its speed increases about {{convert|100|mph}} per year. Impact velocity peaks at about {{convert|1.5|km/s|abbr=on}}. [[Perturbation (astronomy)|Orbital perturbations]] cause longitude drift of the inoperable spacecraft and [[precession]] of the orbital plane. Close approaches (within 50 meters) are estimated at one per year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110718231404/http://www.weblab.dlr.de/rbrt/pdf/ISSFD_89085.pdf "Colocation Strategy and Collision Avoidance for the Geostationary Satellites at 19 Degrees West."] ''CNES Symposium on Space Dynamics'', 6–10 November 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; The collision debris pose less short-term risk than from an LEO collision, but the satellite would likely become inoperable. Large objects, such as [[Space-based solar power|solar-power satellites]], are especially vulnerable to collisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = van der Ha | first1 = J. C. | last2 = Hechler | first2 = M. | year = 1981| title = The Collision Probability of Geostationary Satellites | url = http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1981rome.iafcR....V | journal = 32nd International Astronautical Congress | volume = 1981 | issue = | page = 23 | bibcode=1981rome.iafcR....V}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]] now requires proof a satellite can be moved out of its orbital slot at the end of its lifespan, studies suggest this is insufficient.&lt;ref name= Anselmo&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Anselmo | first1 = L. | last2 = Pardini | first2 = C. | year = 2000 | title = Collision Risk Mitigation in Geostationary Orbit | url = | journal = Space Debris | volume = 2 | issue = 2| pages = 67–82 | doi = 10.1023/A:1021255523174 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since GEO orbit is too distant to accurately measure objects under {{convert|1|m|abbr=on}}, the nature of the problem is not well known.&lt;ref&gt;''Orbital Debris'', p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; Satellites could be moved to empty spots in GEO, requiring less maneuvring and making it easier to predict future motion.&lt;ref&gt;''Orbital Debris'', p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Satellites or boosters in other orbits, especially stranded in [[geostationary transfer orbit]], are an additional concern due to their typically high crossing velocity.

Despite efforts to reduce risk, spacecraft collisions have occurred. The [[European Space Agency]] telecom satellite [[Olympus-1]] was struck by a meteoroid on 11 August 1993 and eventually moved to a [[graveyard orbit]].&lt;ref name="The Olympus failure"&gt;[http://www.selkirkshire.demon.co.uk/analoguesat/olympuspr.html "The Olympus failure"] ''ESA press release'', 26 August 1993.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911181644/http://www.selkirkshire.demon.co.uk/analoguesat/olympuspr.html |date=11 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 29 March 2006, the Russian [[Express (satellite)|Express-AM11]] communications satellite was struck by an unknown object and rendered inoperable;&lt;ref name=srdc20060419&gt;[http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=20320 "Notification for Express-AM11 satellite users in connection with the spacecraft failure"] ''Russian Satellite Communications Company'', 19 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; its engineers had enough contact time with the satellite to send it into a graveyard orbit.

An example of additional dead satellite debris are the remains of the 1970s/80s [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[RORSAT]] naval surveillance satellite program. The satellite's BES-5 [[Nuclear reactor technology|nuclear reactor]] were cooled with a coolant loop of [[NaK|sodium-potassium alloy]], creating a potential problem when the satellite reached end of life. While many satellites were nominally boosted into medium-altitude [[graveyard orbit]]s, not all were. Even satellites which had been properly moved to a higher orbit had an eight-percent probability of puncture and coolant release over a 50-year period. The coolant freezes into droplets of solid sodium-potassium alloy,&lt;ref name=wiedemann2009&gt;C. Wiedemann et al, "Size distribution of NaK droplets for MASTER-2009", ''Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Space Debris'', 30 March-2 April 2009, (ESA SP-672, July 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; forming additional debris.&lt;ref name=rossi1997&gt;A.

These events continue to occur.  For example, in February 2015, the [[USAF]] [[Defense Meteorological Satellite Program]] Flight 13 (DMSP-F13) exploded on orbit, creating at least 149 debris objects, which were expected to remain in orbit for decades.&lt;ref name=sn20150506&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gruss|first1=Mike |title=DMSP-F13 Debris To Stay On Orbit for Decades |url=http://spacenews.com/dmsp-f13-debris-to-stay-on-orbit-for-decades/ |accessdate=7 May 2015 |work=Space News |date=2015-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although spacecraft are protected by [[Whipple shield]]s, solar panels, which are exposed to the Sun, wear from low-mass impacts. These produce a cloud of [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] which is an electrical risk to the panels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Akahoshi | first1 = Y. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2008 | title = Influence of space debris impact on solar array under power generation | url = | journal = International Journal of Impact Engineering | volume = 35 | issue = 12| pages = 1678–1682 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijimpeng.2008.07.048 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Satellites are believed to have been destroyed by micrometeorites and orbital debris (MMOD). The earliest suspected loss was of Kosmos 1275, which disappeared on 24 July 1981 (a month after launch). Kosmos contained no volatile propellant, therefore, there appeared to be nothing internal to the satellite which could have caused the destructive explosion which took place. However the case has not been proven and another hypothesis forwarded is that the battery exploded. Tracking showed it broke up, into 300 new objects.

Many impacts have been confirmed since. [[Olympus-1]] was struck by a meteoroid on 11 August 1993, and left adrift.&lt;ref name="The Olympus failure" /&gt; On 24 July 1996, the French [[Miniaturized satellite|microsatellite]] [[Cerise (satellite)|Cerise]] was hit by fragments of an Ariane-1 H-10 upper-stage booster which exploded in November 1986.&lt;ref name="Klinkrad, p. 2" /&gt; On 29 March 2006, the Russian Ekspress AM11 communications satellite was struck by an unknown object and rendered inoperable;&lt;ref name=srdc20060419 /&gt; its engineers had sufficient time in contact with the spacecraft to send it to a [[parking orbit]] out of GEO.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} On October 13, 2009, [[Terra (satellite)|Terra]] suffered a single battery cell failure anomaly and a battery heater control anomaly which were likely the result of an MMOD strike.&lt;ref name="Mission Report"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kelley|first1=Angelita|title=Terra mission operations: Launch to the present (and beyond)|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20160008917.pdf|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 12, 2010, [[Aura (satellite)|Aura]] lost power from one-half of one of its 11 solar panels and this was also attributed to an MMOD strike.&lt;ref name="2017Status"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fisher|first1=Dominic|title=Mission Status at Aura Science Team MOWG Meeting|date=13 June 2017|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20170005606.pdf|accessdate=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 22, 2013 GOES-13 was hit by an MMOD which caused it to lose track of the stars that it uses to maintain attitude.

From the early [[Space Shuttle]] missions, NASA used NORAD to monitor the Shuttle's orbital path for debris. In the 1980s, this used much of its capacity.&lt;ref name=s50 /&gt; The first collision-avoidance maneuver occurred during [[STS-48]] in September 1991,&lt;ref name=encounters&gt;Rob Matson, [http://www.satobs.org/satclose.html "Satellite Encounters"] ''Visual Satellite Observer's Home Page''.&lt;/ref&gt; a seven-second [[reaction control system|thruster burn]] to avoid debris from [[Kosmos 955]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/52642978/STS-48-Space-Shuttle-Mission-Report "STS-48 Space Shuttle Mission Report"], NASA, NASA-CR-193060, October 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar maneuvers followed on missions 53, 72 and 82.&lt;ref name=encounters /&gt;

One of the first events to publicize the debris problem occurred on [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']]'s second flight, [[STS-7]]. A fleck of paint struck its front window, creating a pit over {{Convert|1|mm|2|abbr=on}} wide. On [[STS-59]] in 1994, [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']]'s front window was pitted about half its depth. Minor debris impacts increased from 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Christiansen | first1 = E. L. | last2 = Hyden | first2 = J. L. | last3 = Bernhard | first3 = R.

Window chipping and minor damage to [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system tiles]] (TPS) was already common by the 1990s. The Shuttle was later flown tail-first to take the debris load mostly on the engines and rear cargo bay (not used in orbit or during descent, and less critical for post-launch operation). When flying to the [[International Space Station|ISS]], the two connected spacecraft were flipped around so the better-armored station shielded the orbiter.&lt;ref name=threat /&gt;

On a normal (low-orbit) mission to the ISS the risk was c. 1 in 300, but [[STS-125]] (the [[Hubble Space Telescope|Hubble]] repair mission) at {{convert|350|mi|km|abbr=on}} was initially calculated at a 1-in-185 risk (due to the [[2009 satellite collision]]). A re-analysis with better debris numbers reduced the estimated risk to 1 in 221, and the mission went ahead.&lt;ref&gt;William Harwood, [http://www.spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts125/090416debris/ "Improved odds ease NASA's concerns about space debris"], ''CBS News'', 16 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original re-entry plan for [[Skylab]] called for the station to remain in space for eight to ten years after its final mission in February 1974. High solar activity expanded the upper atmosphere, resulting in higher-than-expected drag and bringing its orbit closer to Earth than planned.

Radar and optical detectors such as [[lidar]] are the main tools for tracking space debris. Although objects under {{convert|10|cm|0|abbr=on}} have reduced orbital stability, debris as small as 1&amp;nbsp;cm can be tracked,&lt;ref&gt;D.

=== Gabbard diagrams ===
A debris cloud resulting from a single event is studied with [[scatter plot]]s known as Gabbard diagrams, where the [[perigee]] and [[apogee]] of fragments are plotted with respect to their [[orbital period]]. Gabbard diagrams of the early debris cloud prior to the effects of perturbations, if the data were available, are reconstructed. They often include data on newly observed, as yet uncatalogued fragments.

By October 2017, both OneWeb—and also SpaceX, with their large [[Starlink (satellite constellation)|Starlink constellation]]—had filed documents with the US [[FCC]] with more aggressive space debris mitigation plans.

Another approach to debris mitigation is to explicitly design the mission architecture to always leave the rocket second-stage in an [[elliptic orbit|elliptical]] [[geocentric orbit]] with a low-[[perigee]], thus ensuring rapid [[orbital decay]] and avoiding long-term orbital debris from spent rocket bodies.  Such missions require the use of a small [[Apogee kick motor|kick stage]] to circularize the orbit, but the kick stage itself may be designed with the excess-propellant capability to be able to self-deorbit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2018/03/rocket-lab-capitalize-test-flight-success-first-operational-mission/ https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2018/03/rocket-lab-capitalize-test-flight-success-first-operational-mission/]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self-removal ===
Although the ITU requires geostationary satellites to move to a graveyard orbit at the end of their lives, the selected orbital areas do not sufficiently protect GEO lanes from debris.&lt;ref name= Anselmo /&gt; Rocket stages (or satellites) with enough propellant may make a direct, controlled de-orbit, or if this would require too much propellant, a satellite may be brought to an orbit where atmospheric drag would cause it to eventually de-orbit.

Passive methods of increasing the orbital decay rate of spacecraft debris have been proposed.

=== External removal ===
A consensus of speakers at a meeting in Brussels on 30 October 2012 organized by the Secure World Foundation (a U.S. think tank) and the French International Relations Institute&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacenews.com/article/experts-active-removal-key-countering-space-junk-threat#.Ub3dSuce2Zc "Experts: Active Removal Key To Countering Space Junk Threat"] Peter B. de Selding, Space.com 31 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; reported that removal of the largest debris would be required to prevent the risk to spacecraft becoming unacceptable in the foreseeable future (without any addition to the inventory of dead spacecraft in LEO). Removal costs and legal questions about ownership and the authority to remove defunct satellites have stymied national or international action. Current space law retains ownership of all satellites with their original operators, even debris or spacecraft which are defunct or threaten active missions.

{{as of|2006}} the cost of any of these solutions is about the same as launching a spacecraft{{failed verification|date=December 2015}} and, according to NASA's Nicholas Johnson, not cost-effective.&lt;ref name=natgeo /&gt;{{outdated inline|date=December 2015}} Since then Space Sweeper with Sling-Sat (4S), a grappling satellite which captures and ejects debris, has been studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jan |first=McHarg |url=http://phys.org/news/2012-08-aims-space-debris.html |title=Project aims to remove space debris |publisher=Phys.org |date=10 August 2012 |accessdate=2013-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variation of this approach is for the remotely controlled vehicle to rendezvous with debris, [[Spacecraft capture|capture]] it temporarily to attach a [[smallsat|smaller de-orbit satellite]] and drag the debris with a tether to the desired location.  The "mothership" would then tow the debris-smallsat combination for [[atmospheric entry]] or move it to a graveyard orbit.

==== Laser methods ====
The [[laser broom]] uses a ground-based [[laser]] to [[Ablation|ablate]] the front of the debris, producing a rocket-like thrust which slows the object. With continued application, the debris would fall enough to be influenced by atmospheric drag.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Campbell, [http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/cst/csat20.pdf "Using Lasers in Space: Laser Orbital Debris Removal and Asteroid Deflection"], Occasional Paper No. 20, Air University, Maxwell Air Force Base, December 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wired20111026&gt;{{cite news |last=Mann|first=Adam |title=Space Junk Crisis: Time to Bring in the Lasers |url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/10/space-junk-laser/ |accessdate=1 November 2011 |newspaper=Wired Science |date=26 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the late 1990s, the U.S. Air Force's Project Orion was a laser-broom design.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Bekey, "[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1997ESASP.393..699B Project Orion: Orbital Debris Removal Using Ground-Based Sensors and Lasers].", ''Second European Conference on Space Debris'', 1997, ESA-SP 393, p. 699.&lt;/ref&gt; Although a test-bed device was scheduled to launch on a Space Shuttle in 2003, international agreements banning powerful laser testing in orbit limited its use to measurements.&lt;ref name=srdc20000816&gt;Justin Mullins [http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=2426 "A clean sweep: NASA plans to carry out a spot of housework."], ''New Scientist'', 16 August 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'' disaster]] postponed the project and according to Nicholas Johnson, chief scientist and program manager for NASA's Orbital Debris Program Office, "There are lots of little gotchas in the Orion final report.

The momentum of the laser-beam [[photon]]s could directly impart a thrust on the debris sufficient to move small debris into new orbits out of the way of working satellites. NASA research in 2011 indicates that firing a laser beam at a piece of space junk could impart an impulse of {{convert|1|mm|abbr=on}} per second, and keeping the laser on the debris for a few hours per day could alter its course by {{convert|200|m|abbr=on}} per day.&lt;ref name=UKmail20110316&gt;James Mason et al, [https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.1690 "Orbital Debris-Debris Collision Avoidance"], arXiv:1103.1690v2, 9 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; One drawback is the potential for material degradation; the energy may break up the debris, adding to the problem.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} A similar proposal places the laser on a satellite in [[Sun-synchronous orbit]], using a pulsed beam to push satellites into lower orbits to accelerate their reentry.&lt;ref name=sn20141125 /&gt; A proposal to replace the laser with an [[Ion Beam Shepherd]] has been made,&lt;ref&gt;C.

=== Micrometeoroids ===
{{Off topic|date=October 2014|Micrometeoroid}}
{{Main|Micrometeoroid}}
In 1946 during the [[Giacobinids|Giacobinid meteor shower]], [[Helmut Landsberg]] collected several small magnetic particles that were apparently associated with the shower.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Whipple, [http://www.pnas.org/content/36/12/687.full.pdf?ck=nck "The Theory of Micro-Meteorites, Part I: In an Isothermal Atmosphere"], ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'', Volume 36 Number 12 (15 December 1950), pp. 667 – 695.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fred Whipple]] was intrigued by this and wrote a paper that demonstrated that particles of this size were too small to maintain their velocity when they encountered the [[upper atmosphere]]. Instead, they quickly decelerated and then fell to Earth unmelted. In order to classify these sorts of objects, he coined the term "[[micrometeorite|micro-meteorite]]".&lt;ref&gt;Fred Whipple, [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1949PA.....57..517W "The Theory of Micrometeorites."], ''Popular Astronomy'', Volume 57, 1949, p. 517.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whipple, in collaboration with Fletcher Watson of the [[Harvard Observatory]], led an effort to build an observatory to directly measure the velocity of the meteors that could be seen. At the time the source of the micro-meteorites was not known. Direct measurements at the new observatory were used to locate the source of the meteors, demonstrating that the bulk of material was left over from [[comet]] tails, and that none of it could be shown to have an extra-solar origin.&lt;ref name=whipple1951&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Whipple | first1 = Fred | year = 1951 | title = A Comet Model. II. Physical Relations for Comets and Meteors | journal = Astrophysical Journal | volume = 113 | issue = | pages = 464–474 | bibcode=1951ApJ...113..464W | doi=10.1086/145416}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today it is understood that meteoroids of all sorts are leftover material from the formation of the Solar System, consisting of particles from the [[interplanetary dust cloud]] or other objects made up from this material, like comets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brownlee | first1 = D. E. | last2 = Tomandl | first2 = D. A. | last3 = Olszewski | first3 = E. | year = 1977| title = 1977LPI.....8..145B Interplanetary dust: A new source of extraterrestrial material for laboratory studies | journal = Proceedings of the 8th Lunar Scientific Conference | volume = 1977 | issue = | pages = 149–160 | bibcode=1977LPI.....8..145B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early studies were based on optical measurements only. In 1957, Hans Pettersson conducted one of the first direct measurements of the fall of space dust on the Earth, estimating it to be 14,300,000 tons per year.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Pettersson, "Cosmic Spherules and Meteoritic Dust." ''Scientific American'', Volume 202 Issue 2 (February 1960), pp. 123–132.&lt;/ref&gt; This suggested that the meteoroid flux in space was much higher than the number based on telescope observations. Such a high flux presented a very serious risk to missions deeper in space, specifically the high-orbiting [[Project Apollo|Apollo]] capsules. To determine whether the direct measurement was accurate, a number of additional studies followed, including the [[Pegasus satellite program]]. These showed that the rate of meteors passing into the atmosphere, or flux, was in line with the optical measurements, at around 10,000 to 20,000 tons per year.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Snelling and David Rush, [http://static.icr.org/i/pdf/technical/Moon-Dust-and-the-Age-of-the-Solar-System.pdf "Moon Dust and the Age of the Solar System"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512174406/http://static.icr.org/i/pdf/technical/Moon-Dust-and-the-Age-of-the-Solar-System.pdf |date=12 May 2011 }} ''Creation Ex-Nihilo Technical Journal'', Volume 7 Number 1 (1993), p. 2–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Micrometeoroid shielding ===
{{Off topic|date=October 2014|Micrometeoroid}}&lt;!-- I don't think so; it needs a copyedit but the material is about shielding spacecraft from space debris of the small size.  Probably a mistake to name it "micrometeoroid", since none of the small orbital stuff, natural or manmade, is a micrometeoroid until in reenters the atmosphere. --&gt;
[[File:Hypervelocity Impact Demonstration.jpg|left|thumb|The "energy flash" of a [[hypervelocity]] impact during a simulation of what happens when a piece of orbital debris hits a spacecraft in orbit.]]

Whipple's work pre-dated the [[space race]] and it proved useful when space exploration started only a few years later. His studies had demonstrated that the chance of being hit by a meteoroid large enough to destroy a spacecraft was extremely remote. However, a spacecraft would be almost constantly struck by micrometeorites, about the size of dust grains.&lt;ref name=whipple1951 /&gt;

Whipple had already developed a solution to this problem in 1946. Originally known as a "meteor bumper" and now termed the [[Whipple shield]], this consists of a thin foil film held a short distance away from the spacecraft's body. When a micrometeoroid strikes the foil, it vaporizes into a plasma that quickly spreads. By the time this plasma crosses the gap between the shield and the spacecraft, it is so diffused that it is unable to penetrate the structural material below.&lt;ref name=Marsden&gt;Brian Marsden, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/professor-fred-whipple-533019.html "Professor Fred Whipple: Astronomer who developed the idea that comets are 'dirty snowballs'."] ''The Independent'', 13 November 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The shield allows a spacecraft body to be built to just the thickness needed for structural integrity, while the foil adds little additional weight. Such a spacecraft is lighter than one with panels designed to stop the meteoroids directly.

For spacecraft that spend the majority of their time in orbit, some variety of the Whipple shield has been almost universal for decades.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Whipple, [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/289/5480/728 "Of Comets and Meteors"] ''Science'', Volume 289 Number 5480 (4 August 2000), p. 728.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Judith Reustle (curator), [http://ares.jsc.nasa.gov/ares/hvit/basic.cfm "Shield Development: Basic Concepts"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927133616/http://ares.jsc.nasa.gov/ares/hvit/basic.cfm |date=27 September 2011 }}, NASA HVIT.

=== NORAD, Gabbard and Kessler ===
To avoid artificial space debris, many—but not all—research satellites are launched on [[elliptical orbit]]s with perigees inside Earth's atmosphere so they will destroy themselves. [[Willy Ley]] predicted in 1960 that "In time, a number of such accidentally too-lucky shots will accumulate in space and will have to be removed when the era of manned space flight arrives".&lt;ref name="ley196008"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Ley |first=Willy |date=August 1960 |title=How to Slay Dragons |url=https://archive.org/stream/Galaxy_v18n06_1960-08#page/n55/mode/2up |magazine=Galaxy Science Fiction |pages=57–72 |department=For Your Information}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the launch of [[Sputnik 1]] in 1957, the [[North American Aerospace Defense Command]] (NORAD) began compiling a database (the [[Space Object Catalog]]) of all known rocket launches and objects reaching orbit: satellites, protective shields and upper- and lower-stage booster rockets. [[NASA]] published modified versions of the database in [[two-line element set]],&lt;ref name="Hoots"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Felix Hoots | first1 = Paul Schumacher Jr. | last2 = Glover | first2 = Robert | year = | title = History of Analytical Orbit Modeling in the U.S. Space Surveillance System | url = | journal = Journal of Guidance Control and Dynamics | volume = 27 | issue = 2| pages = 174–185 | doi=10.2514/1.9161| bibcode = 2004JGCD...27..174H}}&lt;/ref&gt; and during the early 1980s the CelesTrak [[bulletin board system]] re-published them.&lt;ref&gt;T.S. Kelso, [http://celestrak.com/NORAD/archives/ CelesTrak BBS: Historical Archives], 2-line elements dating to 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gabbard diagram.png|thumb|alt=Debris graph of altitude and orbital period|Gabbard diagram of almost 300 pieces of debris from the disintegration of the five-month-old third stage of the Chinese Long March 4 booster on 11 March 2000]]
The trackers who fed the database were aware of other objects in orbit, many of which were the result of in-orbit explosions.&lt;ref name=s48&gt;Schefter, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Some were deliberately caused during 1960s [[anti-satellite weapon]] (ASAT) testing, and others were the result of rocket stages blowing up in orbit as leftover propellant expanded and ruptured their tanks. To improve tracking, NORAD employee John Gabbard kept a separate database. Studying the explosions, Gabbard developed a technique for predicting the orbital paths of their products, and Gabbard diagrams (or plots) are now widely used. These studies were used to improve the modelling of orbital evolution and decay.&lt;ref name=portree /&gt;

When the NORAD database became publicly available during the 1970s, NASA scientist [[Donald J. Kessler]] applied the technique developed for the asteroid-belt study to the database of known objects. In 1978 Kessler and Burton Cour-Palais co-authored "Collision Frequency of Artificial Satellites: The Creation of a Debris Belt",&lt;ref name=Kessler78&gt;Kessler 1978&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrating that the process controlling asteroid evolution would cause a similar collision process in LEO in decades rather than billions of years. They concluded that by about 2000, space debris would outpace micrometeoroids as the primary ablative risk to orbiting spacecraft.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt;

At the time, it was widely thought that drag from the [[Atmosphere of Earth|upper atmosphere]] would de-orbit debris faster than it was created. However, Gabbard was aware that the number and type of objects in space were under-represented in the NORAD data and was familiar with its behaviour. In an interview shortly after the publication of Kessler's paper, Gabbard coined the term "[[Kessler syndrome]]" to refer to the accumulation of debris;&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt; it became widely used after its appearance in a 1982 ''[[Popular Science]]'' article,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Schefter&lt;/ref&gt; which won the Aviation-Space Writers Association 1982 National Journalism Award.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt;

=== Follow-up studies ===
[[File:Baker-Nunn camera.jpg|left|thumb|upright|alt=Large camera, with a man standing next to it for scale|[[Schmidt camera#Baker-Nunn|Baker-Nunn cameras]] were widely used to study space debris.]]
The lack of hard data about space debris prompted a series of studies to better characterize the LEO environment. In October 1979, [[NASA]] provided Kessler with funding for further studies.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt; Several approaches were used by these studies.

Optical telescopes or short-wavelength radar was used to measure the number and size of space objects, and these measurements demonstrated that the published population count was at least 50% too low.&lt;ref name=k9165&gt;Kessler 1991, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Before this, it was believed that the NORAD database accounted for the majority of large objects in orbit. Some objects (typically, U.S. military spacecraft) were found to be omitted from the NORAD list, and others were not included because they were considered unimportant. The list could not easily account for objects under {{convert|20|cm|abbr=on}} in size—in particular, debris from exploding rocket stages and several 1960s anti-satellite tests.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt;

Returned spacecraft were microscopically examined for small impacts, and sections of [[Skylab]] and the [[Apollo Command/Service Module]] which were recovered were found to be pitted. Each study indicated that the debris flux was higher than expected and debris was the primary source of collisions in space. LEO already demonstrated the Kessler syndrome.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt;

In 1978 Kessler found that 42 percent of cataloged debris was the result of 19 events, primarily explosions of spent rocket stages (especially U.S. [[Delta (rocket family)|Delta rockets]]).&lt;ref name=kessler81&gt;Kessler 1981&lt;/ref&gt; He discovered this by first identifying those launches that were described having a large number of objects associated with a payload, then researching the literature to determine the rockets used in the launch.  In 1979, this finding resulted in establishment of the NASA Orbital Debris Program after a briefing to NASA senior management, overturning the previously held belief that most unknown debris was from old ASAT tests, but from US upper stage rocket explosions and could be easily managed by depleting the unused fuel following the payload injection the upper stage Delta rocket.  Beginning in 1986, when it was discovered that other international agencies were possibly experiencing the same type of problem, NASA expanded its program to include international agencies, the first being the European Space Agency.&lt;ref name="Klinkrad, p. 2"&gt;Klinkrad, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of other Delta components in orbit (Delta was a workhorse of the U.S. space program) had not yet exploded.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

=== {{anchor|A new Kessler Syndrome}}A new Kessler syndrome ===
During the 1980s, the U.S. Air Force conducted an experimental program to determine what would happen if debris collided with satellites or other debris. The study demonstrated that the process differed from micrometeoroid collisions, with large chunks of debris created which would become collision threats.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt;

In 1991, Kessler published "Collisional cascading: The limits of population growth in low Earth orbit"&lt;ref&gt;[http://meteor.uwo.ca/kessler/Critical%20Density%201991.pdf pdf of article]&lt;/ref&gt; with the best data then available. Citing the USAF conclusions about creation of debris, he wrote that although almost all debris objects (such as paint flecks) were lightweight, most of its mass was in debris about {{convert|1|kg|abbr=on}} or heavier. This mass could destroy a spacecraft on impact, creating more debris in the critical-mass area.&lt;ref name=k9163 /&gt; According to the National Academy of Sciences:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A 1-kg object impacting at 10&amp;nbsp;km/s, for example, is probably capable of catastrophically breaking up a 1,000-kg spacecraft if it strikes a high-density element in the spacecraft. In such a breakup, numerous fragments larger than 1&amp;nbsp;kg would be created.&lt;ref&gt;Technical, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=February 2015}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kessler's analysis divided the problem into three parts. With a low-enough density, the addition of debris by impacts is slower than their decay rate and the problem is not significant. Beyond that is a critical density, where additional debris leads to additional collisions. At densities beyond this critical mass production exceeds decay, leading to a cascading [[chain reaction]] reducing the orbiting population to small objects (several cm in size) and increasing the hazard of space activity.&lt;ref name=k9163 /&gt; This chain reaction is known as the Kessler syndrome.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt;

In an early 2009 historical overview, Kessler summed up the situation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Aggressive space activities without adequate safeguards could significantly shorten the time between collisions and produce an intolerable hazard to future spacecraft. Some of the most environmentally dangerous activities in space include large constellations such as those initially proposed by the Strategic Defense Initiative in the mid-1980s, large structures such as those considered in the late-1970s for building solar power stations in Earth orbit, and anti-satellite warfare using systems tested by the USSR, the U.S., and China over the past 30 years. Such aggressive activities could set up a situation where a single satellite failure could lead to cascading failures of many satellites in a period much shorter than years.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Debris growth ===
During the 1980s, NASA and other U.S. groups attempted to limit the growth of debris. One effective&lt;!-- see Kessler's estimate above about debris from exploding boosters --&gt; solution was implemented by [[McDonnell Douglas]] on the Delta booster,{{when|date=December 2014}} by having the booster move away from its payload and vent any propellant remaining in its tanks. This eliminated the pressure buildup in the tanks which caused them to explode in the past.&lt;ref name=s50&gt;Schefter, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Other countries were slower to adopt this measure and, due especially to a number of launches by the [[Soviet Union]], the problem grew throughout the decade.&lt;ref name=h7&gt;See charts, Hoffman p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

A new battery of studies followed{{when|date=December 2014}} as NASA, NORAD and others attempted to better understand the orbital environment, with each adjusting the number of pieces of debris in the critical-mass zone upward. Although in 1981 (when Schefter's article was published) the number of objects was estimated at 5,000,&lt;ref name=s48 /&gt; new detectors in the [[Ground-based Electro-Optical Deep Space Surveillance]] system found new objects. By the late 1990s, it was thought that most of the 28,000 launched objects had already decayed and about 8,500 remained in orbit.&lt;ref&gt;See chart, Hoffman p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2005 this was adjusted upward to 13,000 objects,&lt;ref&gt;In the time between writing Chapter 1 (earlier) and the Prolog (later) of ''Space Debris'', Klinkrad changed the number from 8,500 to 13,000 – compare p. 6 and ix.&lt;/ref&gt; and a 2006 study increased the number to 19,000 as a result of an [[Anti-satellite weapon|ASAT]] test and a satellite collision.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hoffman, [http://defensenews.com/blogs/space-symposium/ "It's getting crowded up there."] ''Space News'', 3 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, NASA said that 22,000 objects were being tracked.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2011/04/06/space-junk-threat-grow-astronauts-satellites/ "Space Junk Threat Will Grow for Astronauts and Satellites"], Fox News, 6 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth in the number of objects as a result of the late-1990s studies sparked debate in the space community on the nature of the problem and the earlier dire warnings. According to Kessler's 1991 derivation and 2001 updates,&lt;ref&gt;Kessler 2001&lt;/ref&gt; the LEO environment in the {{convert|1000|km|abbr=on}} altitude range should be cascading. However, only one major incident has occurred: the [[2009 satellite collision]] between Iridium 33 and Cosmos 2251. The lack of obvious short-term cascading has led to speculation that the original estimates overstated the problem.&lt;ref&gt;Technical&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=February 2015}} According to Kessler a cascade would not be obvious until it was well advanced, which might take years.&lt;ref name=graph&gt;Jan Stupl et al, [http://swfound.org/media/28344/Stupl-DebrisAvoidanceUsingLasers.pdf "Debris-debris collision avoidance using medium power ground-based lasers"], 2010 Beijing Orbital Debris Mitigation Workshop, 18–19 October 2010, see graph p. 4  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309055302/http://swfound.org/media/28344/Stupl-DebrisAvoidanceUsingLasers.pdf |date=9 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 NASA model suggested that if no new launches took place the environment would retain the then-known population until about 2055, when it would increase on its own.&lt;ref name=natgeo&gt;Stefan Lovgren, [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/01/0119_060119_space_junk.html "Space Junk Cleanup Needed, NASA Experts Warn."] ''National Geographic News'', 19 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.-C Liou and N. L. Johnson, [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/311/5759/340 "Risks in Space from Orbiting Debris"], ''Science'', Volume 311 Number 5759 (20 January 2006), pp. 340 – 341&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Crowther of Britain's [[Defence Evaluation and Research Agency]] said in 2002 that he believed the cascade would begin about 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Antony Milne, ''Sky Static: The Space Debris Crisis'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002, {{ISBN|0-275-97749-8}}, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; The National Academy of Sciences, summarizing the professional view, noted widespread agreement that two bands of LEO space—900 to {{convert|1000|km|abbr=on}} and {{convert|1500|km|abbr=on}}—were already past  critical density.&lt;ref&gt;Technical, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2009 European Air and Space Conference, [[University of Southampton]] researcher Hugh Lewis predicted that the threat from space debris would rise 50 percent in the next decade and quadruple in the next 50 years. {{asof|2009}}, more than 13,000 close calls were tracked weekly.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Marks, [https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18050-space-debris-threat-to-future-launches.html "Space debris threat to future launches"], 27 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 report by the [[National Research Council (United States)|U.S. National Research Council]] warned [[NASA]] that the amount of orbiting space debris was at a critical level. According to some computer models, the amount of space debris "has reached a tipping point, with enough currently in orbit to continually collide and create even more debris, raising the risk of spacecraft failures". The report called for international regulations limiting debris and research of disposal methods.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-14757926 Space junk at tipping point, says report], BBC News, 2 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The plot of episode 4 ("Conflict") of Gerry Anderson's 1970 TV series ''[[UFO (TV series)|UFO]]'' includes routine missions for the disposal of spent satellites by bombing.

''[[Salvage 1]]'' (1979 TV series) deals humorously with a scrap dealer who establish a space junk salvage company.

''[[Planetes]]'' is a manga (1999-2004) and anime series (2003-2004) that gives focus on a team which is responsible for the collection and disposal of space debris. The DVDs for the TV series include interviews with NASA's Orbital Debris Program Office.

In 2009, [[Rhett and Link|Rhett &amp; Link]] wrote a song called "Space Junk" and made an accompanying music video for the TV series ''[[Brink (TV series)|Brink]]''.  The lyrics refer to two men tasked to clean up debris such as satellites and expended rockets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fy7psIuJjc |author=Rhett &amp; Link |author-link=Rhett and Link |title=Space Junk Song |website=YouTube |type=video |accessdate=18 August 2018 |date=6 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Gravity (2013 film)|Gravity]]'' is a 2013 survival film, directed by Alfonso Cuaron, about a disaster on a space mission caused by [[Kessler syndrome]].

{{other people||Stephen Williams (disambiguation)}}
'''Stephen Williams''' (31 March 1908 - 23 November 1994) was a British radio announcer, presenter and producer, and a pioneer of commercial radio for the UK.

Born in London and educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, as a young boy he was already, in his words, a "wireless fanatic": he said, "I was able to listen proudly to the debut of the BBC on 14 November 1922, and from the moment I heard the announcer say "This is 2LO calling, 2LO, the London station of the British Broadcasting Company", I was seized with an ambition to have a job like his."

During his university vacation in 1928 he got a job as announcer on a "broadcasting yacht" sponsored by the Daily Mail newspaper group. This vessel went round the coast of Britain, transmitting music on records and advertisements for the Daily Mail, from just outside territorial waters, an early precursor of the 1960s "pirate radio" ships..

The broadcasting yacht had been the idea of the paper's Circulation and Publicity Director, Valentine Smith, who soon transferred to the Sunday Referee, where he gave Williams a job with the idea of involving the paper in commercial broadcasting. They were soon in contact with Captain [[Leonard F. Plugge]], who was starting the [[International Broadcasting Company]] (IBC).&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Williams, "Pioneering commercial radio the D-I-Y way", ''European Journal of Marketing'', October 1987. {{cite web |url=http://www.offshoreechos.com/radionormandie/_private/stepheneng.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030903160037/http://www.offshoreechos.com/radionormandie/_private/stepheneng.htm |archivedate=2003-09-03 |df= }} {{ISSN|0309-0566}} 
(journal title and date wrongly cited on web page).&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of 1932, Williams was sent to France to join Max Staniforth at the IBC's new Radio Normandy service, broadcasting to the south of England.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Plomley, ''Days Seemed Longer: Early Years of a Broadcaster'', London, 1980, p.123. {{ISBN|0-413-39730-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recordings of two commercials read by Stephen Williams on Radio Normandy in 1932 are said to survive.&lt;ref&gt;Sean Street, "Radio For Sale: Sponsored Programming in British Radio during the 1930s", in ''Sound Journal'', Bournemouth University, 1999. [http://www.kent.ac.uk/sdfva/sound-journal/Street19991.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Williams moved on to a rival company to IBC, Radio Publicity, which started broadcasting to the UK from Radio Paris, then a much more powerful station than Radio Normandy, which rapidly gained a large British audience. But French listeners complained that their most popular station was now too dominated by English programmes, so Radio Publicity turned to the newly created [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]], where it was able to gain the sole concession for English programmes.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1933 Williams thus became the first English radio presenter in Luxembourg as well as serving as manager of the station.

Shortly before his death in 1994, Williams gave an interview to Roger Bickerton about his work at Radio Luxembourg which was published in ''The Historic Record and AV Collector'', Issues 39,40 and 41, April, June &amp; October 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Sean Street, "Recording Technologies and Strategies for British Radio Transmission Before the 2nd World War", in ''Sound Journal'', Bournemouth University, 2002. [http://www.kent.ac.uk/sdfva/sound-journal/street002.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Radio Luxembourg closed down on the outbreak of World War II in September 1939. Stephen Williams resumed his duties there when the station restarted in 1946. He left Luxembourg in 1948, and worked until 1975 as a freelance broadcaster.

When, on 1 January 1992, Radio Luxembourg's English service closed down as a terrestrial radio station, the last words heard, "Good luck, good listening ... and goodbye" were spoken by 83-year-old Stephen Williams, who had been the first person ever to say on the air "This is Radio Luxembourg" over 58 years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;"Last hours on 208m", aircheck available at playlist No 40 on ''The Station of the Stars: Audio Archive''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Williams was awarded the Order of Merit by the Grand Duke of Luxembourg in 1992.

He collected a large archive of material related to Radio Luxembourg, much of which his widow has donated to the Centre for Luxembourg Studies at Sheffield University.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shef.ac.uk/german/prospectiveu_g/courses/clux.html Department of Germanic Studies, University of Sheffield] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070430062114/http://www.shef.ac.uk/german/prospectiveu_g/courses/clux.html |date=2007-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The State of the World's Children 1982–1983'' launches the [[child survival revolution]] and pushed for [[GOBI]] (growth monitoring, [[oral rehydration therapy]], breastfeeding, and immunization).&lt;ref name="1980_1995"/&gt;

The 1988 report argues for the need of a "Grand Alliance" for children between governments, schools, mass media, etc., to continue the child survival and development revolution.&lt;ref name="1980_1995"/&gt;

The 1991 report features the [[World Summit for Children]], which happened the previous year. The report covers the commitment made by the Summit and serves as a record.&lt;ref name="1980_1995"/&gt;

{{Three worlds}}
The terms ''[[First World]]'', ''[[Second World]]'', and ''[[Third World]]'' were originally used to divide the world's nations into three categories. The model did not emerge to its end state all at once. The complete overthrow of the post–[[World War II]] status quo, known as the [[Cold War]], left two superpowers (the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]]) vying for ultimate global supremacy. They created two camps, known as blocs. These blocs formed the basis of the concepts of the First and Second Worlds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Gaddis |first1= John |title= We Now Know: Rethinking Cold War History |year= 1998 |publisher= Oxford University Press |location= Oxford |isbn= 0-19-878071-0 |pages= 1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Cold War ===
Early in the Cold War era, [[NATO]] and the [[Warsaw Pact]] were created by the United States and The Soviet Union, respectively. They were also referred to as the [[NATO|Western Bloc]] and the [[Warsaw Pact|Eastern Bloc]]. The circumstances of these two blocks were so different that they were essentially two worlds, however, they were not numbered first and second.&lt;ref name="p. 21"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Melkote |first1=Srinivas R. |last2=Steeves |first2=H.

 | title = Winston Churchill "Iron Curtain"
 | publisher = The History Place
 | url = http://www.historyplace.com/speeches/ironcurtain.htm
 | accessdate = 2018-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this speech, Churchill describes the division of the West and East to be so solid that it could be called an iron curtain.&lt;ref name=iron/&gt;

In 1952, the French [[demography|demographer]] [[Alfred Sauvy]] coined the term Third World in reference to the three estates in pre-revolutionary France.&lt;ref name=model&gt;{{Cite web
 | title = Three Worlds Model
 | publisher = University of Wisconsin Eau Claire

Just as the third estate comprised everybody else, Sauvy called the Third World all the countries that were not in this Cold War division, i.e., the unaligned and uninvolved states in the "East–West Conflict."&lt;ref name=model/&gt;&lt;ref name=leonard1542-3 /&gt; With the coining of the term Third World directly, the first two groups came to be known as the "First World" and "Second World," respectively. Here the three-world system emerged.&lt;ref name=leonard1542-3 /&gt;

However, [[Secwepemc|Shuswap]] Chief [[George Manuel]] believed the '''Three Worlds Model''' to be outdated. In his 1974 book ''The Fourth World: An Indian Reality'', he describes the emergence of the [[Fourth World]] while coining the term. The fourth world refers to "nations," e.g., cultural entities and ethnic groups, of indigenous people who do not compose states in the traditional sense.&lt;ref name=fourth&gt;{{Cite web

===Post Cold War===
With [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991]], the Eastern Bloc ceased to exist; with it, so did all applicability of the term Second World.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

'''Transnational organized crime''' ('''TOC''') is [[organized crime]] coordinated [[transnational crime|across national borders]], involving groups or networks of individuals working in more than one country to plan and execute illegal business ventures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Measures to Control Transnational Organized Crime, Summary|author=Yuriy A. Voronin|year=2000|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/184773.pdf|website=National Criminal Justice Reference Service (NCJRS)|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice|accessdate=February 28, 2017|id=
Document No. NCJ 184773}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to achieve their goals, these criminal groups use systematic violence and corruption. The most commonly seen transnational organized crimes are [[money laundering]]; [[human smuggling]]; [[cyber crime]]; and [[Human trafficking|trafficking of humans]], drugs, weapons, kidnapping, people smuggling, [[Poaching|endangered species]], body parts, or [[nuclear material]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

==History==
Prior to [[World War I]], several organizations were created to formalize international police cooperation, but most quickly failed, primarily because public police institutions were not sufficiently detached from the political centers of their respective states to function autonomously as expert bureaucracies.&lt;ref name=JSTOR&gt;{{cite web|title=Bureaucratization and Social Control: Historical Foundations of International Police Cooperation|jstor=3115142}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1914, the First International Criminal Police Congress was held in Monaco, which saw police officers, lawyers and magistrates from 24 countries meeting to discuss arrest procedures, identification techniques, centralized international criminal records and extradition proceedings. This organization appeared poised to avoid the political forces that ended earlier organizations, but the outbreak of World War I disorganized the Congress.&lt;ref name=unodc&gt;{{cite web|title=The International Criminal Police|url=https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/bulletin/bulletin_1951-01-01_3_page003.html|website=UNODC|publisher=UNODC|accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, a second International Criminal Police Congress was held in Vienna, on the initiative of Mr. Hans Schober, President of the Austrian police. Schober, eager to avoid the politics that doomed previous international police efforts, noted that ''"ours is not a political but a cultural goal. It only concerns the fight against the common enemy of humankind: the ordinary criminal."''&lt;ref name=JSTOR /&gt; This second Congress created the International Criminal Police Commission (ICPC), which served as the direct forerunner of Interpol.&lt;ref name=Interpol&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Interpol|url=http://www.interpol.int/About-INTERPOL/History|website=Interpol|publisher=Interpol|accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founding members included police officials from Russia, Austria, Germany, Belgium, Poland, China, Egypt, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Romania, Sweden, Switzerland and Yugoslavia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fairtrials.net/documents/Interpol_-_FAQs.pdf |title=Interpol: Frequently Asked Questions |date=November 2011 |publisher=[[Fair Trials International]] |format=PDF |accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926, the ICPC's General Assembly, held in Berlin, proposed that each country establish a central point of contact within its police structure: the forerunner of the National Central Bureau (NCB).&lt;ref name=Interpol /&gt; In 1938, the Nazis assumed control of the ICPC and most countries stop participating, effectively causing the ICPC to cease to exist as an international organization.

After World War II, Belgium led the rebuilding of the organization, with a new headquarters in Paris and a new name - [[Interpol]]. The United Nations did not recognize Interpol as an intergovernmental organization until 1971.&lt;ref name=Interpol /&gt; On June 17, 1971, President Nixon declared ''"America's public enemy number one in the United States is drug abuse. In order to fight and defeat this enemy, it is necessary to wage a new, all-out offensive."'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Remarks About an Intensified Program for Drug Abuse Prevention and Control. June 17, 1971|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=3047|website=The American Presidency Project|publisher=The American Presidency Project|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this declaration, the United States began the [[War on Drugs]]. At the time, the flow of illicit narcotics into its borders was deemed a major risk to the health and safety of Americans, and as a result, enormous resources were spent in the effort to curtail both the supply of and demand for illegal drugs. In the three decades that followed President Nixon's declaration, drug trafficking served as the dominant form of what the United States and many of its allies viewed as transnational organized crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wechsler|first1=William|title=Combating Transnational Organized Crime|url=http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/html/pdf/WechslerPrepared20120426.pdf|website=Washington Institute|publisher=The Washington Institut for Near East Policy|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, that viewpoint has changed. The character of transnational organized crime has changed in three major ways since the war on drugs began. Drug trafficking has become more diversified, criminal networks have harnessed new methods of conducting business, and the structure of criminal networks has changed. Organized crime has gone global, giving way to the term transnational organized crime. Global governance has failed to keep pace with economic globalization. [[Antonio Maria Costa]], former Executive Director of the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]], effectively summarized the change in TOC over the last quarter century by saying, "as unprecedented openness in trade, finance, travel and communication has created economic growth and well-being, it has also given rise to massive opportunities for criminals to make their business prosper."&lt;ref name=unodc /&gt;

==Effects==
Transnational organized crime is widely opposed on the basis of a number of negative effects. It can undermine democracy, disrupt [[free market]]s, drain national assets, and inhibit the development of stable societies.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} In doing so, it has been argued{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}, national and international criminal groups threaten the security of all nations. The victims of these transnational crime networks are governments that are unstable or not powerful enough to prevent them, with the networks conducting illegal activities that provide them with profits. Transnational organized crimes interrupt peace{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} and stability{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} of nations worldwide, often using [[bribery]], violence, or terror to meet their needs.

TOC is insufficiently understood, according to the Executive Director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.&lt;ref name=unodc /&gt; In the most recent full-scale United Nations assessment of TOC, conducted in 2010, the Executive Director states, ''"there is a lack of information on transnational criminal markets and trends. The few studies that exist have looked at sections of the problem, by sector or country, rather than the big picture. Without a global perspective there cannot be evidence-based policy."''&lt;ref name=unodc /&gt; In response to the threat, law enforcement agencies have created a number of effective approaches for '''combating''' this transnational organized crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Effectively Combating Transnational Organized Crime|url=http://www.nij.gov/topics/crime/organized-crime/pages/effective-practices.aspx#note1|website=National Institute of Justice|publisher=Office of Justice Programs|accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Louise I. Shelley (Director of the [[Terrorism, Transnational Crime and Corruption Center]] at [[George Mason University]]) has said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Transnational crime will be a defining issue of the 21st century for policymakers - as defining as the Cold War was for the 20th century and colonialism was for the 19th. Terrorists and transnational crime groups will proliferate because these crime groups are major beneficiaries of globalization. They take advantage of increased travel, trade, rapid money movements, telecommunications and computer links, and are well positioned for growth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.american.edu/traccc/] (This article incorporates text from the [[U.S. Department of State]] that is believed to be in the [[public domain]].)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Combating transnational organized crime==
Most illicit trafficking begins or ends in the world's greatest economic powers, such as the [[G8|G8 (forum)]]. In other words, the world’s largest trading partners are also the world’s greatest markets for illicit goods and services. Many of these world powers have recently taken steps to combat TOC in a large, collective, international effort with partners and allies. Several organizations around the world have initiated efforts to combat TOC whose success or failure have yet to be determined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Strategy to Combat Transnational Organized Crime|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/nsc/transnational-crime/strategy|website=White House|publisher=National Security Council|accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the UN Asia and Far East Institute (UNAFEI), combating transnational organized crime relies first and foremost on effective investigative techniques and prosecutorial tools. Three techniques in particular stand out as the most important in combating transnational organized crime: [[electronic surveillance]], [[undercover operation]]s, and the use of [[confidential informant]]s (CIs),&lt;ref name=unafei&gt;{{cite web|title=Effective Methods to Combat Transnational Organized Crime in Criminal Justice Processes |url=http://www.unafei.or.jp/english/pdf/PDF_rms/no58/58-05.pdf|website=UNAFEI|author=Ohr, Bruce G. |publisher=United Nations|accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with electronic surveillance being the single most important and effective law enforcement tool against TOC.&lt;ref name=unafei /&gt; Electronic surveillance provides reliable, often irrefutable evidence of crimes through a participant's own words or image. This form allows law enforcement to learn of conspirators' plans before they are carried out and is particularly helpful in combating TOC because it enables law enforcement in any country to obtain evidence of co-conspirators in other countries. Obtaining evidence of conspiratorial planning internationally would otherwise be very difficult.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

After electronic surveillance, the second most important tool is undercover operations,&lt;ref name=unafei /&gt; Through undercover operations, law enforcement agents can infiltrate the highest levels of organized crime by posing as criminals themselves when real criminals discuss their plans and seek assistance in committing crimes. Over time, agents can gain the confidence of criminals and induce them to reveal information on past or ongoing criminal activities.{{citation needed |date=October 2016}} followed by CIs refers to individuals who are not willing to testify but who provide information or assistance to law enforcement in exchange for money or lenient treatment for their own crimes and with the promise of confidentiality.&lt;ref name=unafei /&gt; In many cases,{{which|date=October 2016}} CIs are engaged in criminal activity themselves and can therefore provide valuable direct evidence regarding the criminal activities being conducted by their criminal associates. Such evidence frequently enables law enforcement officers to obtain warrants authorizing electronic surveillance. In rare cases, the court may order the disclosure of a CIs identity to a defendant, such as when the informant can provide evidence that may exculpate the defendant.{{citation needed |date=October 2016}}

==Enforcement in the United States==

===Tools of Prosecution=== 
The following are some of the methods used by authorities in the US to combat transnational organised crime:
* [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act|RICO]]
* [[United States Organized Crime Strike Force|Organized Crime Strike Force Units]]
* [[Legal immunity|Immunity System]]{{clarify|date=October 2016}}
* [[Witness Protection|Witness Protection Programs]]
* [[Forfeiture (law)|Forfeiture]]{{dubious|date=October 2016}}
* [[Sentence (law)|Sentences]]

===White House Strategy to Combat Transnational Organized Crime===
In May 2010, the [[White House]] released its [[National Security Strategy (United States)|National Security Strategy]], detailing the need to aggressive combat transnational organized crime. This strategy document states, ''"Combating transnational criminal and trafficking networks requires a multidimensional strategy that safeguards citizens, breaks the financial strength of criminal and terrorist networks, disrupts illicit trafficking networks, defeats transnational criminal organizations, fights government corruption, strengthens the rule of law, bolsters judicial systems, and improves transparency. While these are major challenges, the United States will be able to devise and execute a collective strategy with other nations facing the same threats."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NATIONAL SECURITY  STRATEGY: May 2010|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/national_security_strategy.pdf|website=The White House|publisher=The White House|accessdate=4 September 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927091224/https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/national_security_strategy.pdf|archivedate=27 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, the [[White House]] released its '''Strategy to Combat Transnational Organized Crime''', which reflects this change and sets forth a strategy "''to build, balance, and integrate the tools of American power to combat transnational organized crime and related threats to national security—and to urge our foreign partners to do the same.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Strategy to Combat Transnational Organized Crime: Executive Summary|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/nsc/transnational-crime/summary|website=White House|publisher=National Security Council|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy document set out five overarching policy objectives consistent with the vision and priorities of the National Security Strategy:

# ''Protect Americans and our partners from the harm, violence, and exploitation of transnational criminal networks.'' 
# ''Help partner countries strengthen governance and transparency, break the corruptive power of transnational criminal networks, and sever state-crime alliances.'' 
# ''Break the economic power of transnational criminal networks and protect strategic markets and the U.S. financial system from TOC penetration and abuse.'' 
# ''Defeat transnational criminal networks that pose the greatest threat to national security, by targeting their infrastructures, depriving them of their enabling means, and preventing the criminal facilitation of terrorist activities.''
# ''Build international consensus, multilateral cooperation, and public-private partnerships to defeat transnational organized crime.''

===Enforcement agencies of the United States===

====National Guard====
In keeping with the [[U.S. National Security Council]]'s strategy to combat transnational organized crime, the [[National Guard Bureau]] established the CTOC [[Center of Excellence|Center of Excellence (COE)]] to educate and train [[Unified Combatant Command|Combatant Commands]], military services, [[List of federal agencies in the United States|federal agencies]], state and local law enforcement, and community leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CTOC Center of Excellence|url=http://ctoc.gov|website=CTOC Center of Excellence|publisher=National Guard Burea|accessdate=2 September 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031024757/http://ctoc.gov/|archivedate=31 October 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another approach the United States takes in CTOC is the use of multijurisdictional task forces that combine investigative resources from several agencies so that the strength and sophistication of a task force's capabilities are greater than any single agency. Collaboration among law enforcement agencies is a key element in discovering possible links between local crimes and crimes with a transnational component.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Effectively Combating Transnational Organized Crime|url=http://www.nij.gov/topics/crime/organized-crime/pages/effective-practices.aspx#note1|website=Office of Justice Programs|publisher=National Institute of Justice|accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Guard Bureau uses such an organization in CTOC. Its [[Multijurisdictional Counterdrug Task Force Training]] (MCTFT) program and its Western Regional Counterdrug Training Center provide the core of National Guard Bureau training and collaboration among law enforcement agencies at all levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MCTFT|url=http://mctft.org|website=MCTFT|publisher=National Guard Bureau|accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States Southern Command====
{{main|United States Southern Command}} As the lead U.S. agency responsible for directing illicit trafficking detection and monitoring activities, [[U.S. Southern Command]] (SOUTHCOM) conducts operational and tactical activities in support of whole-of-government efforts to combat transnational organized crime in the maritime approaches to Central America. SOUTHCOM focuses on strengthening the security capacities of U.S. partners in Central America.&lt;ref name=ussouthcom&gt;{{cite web|title=Countering Transnational Organized Crime|url=http://www.southcom.mil/ourmissions/Pages/Countering%20Transnational%20Organized%20Crime.aspx|website=USSOUTHCOM|publisher=USSOUTHCOM|accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another primary focus of SOUTHCOM CTOC efforts is supporting the interdiction of drug trafficking. SOUTHCOM collaborates with other agencies and nations to support CTOC efforts through detection &amp; monitoring, information sharing, and partner nation capacity building.&lt;ref name=ussouthcom /&gt;

====Department of Homeland Security====
Charged with securing the United States, the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) plays an integral role in the U.S. efforts to combat transnational organized crime both at home and with partners abroad. DHS leverages and deploys numerous CTOC resources, while working closely with other federal, state and local agencies, foreign governments and partners in the private sector. Once TOC threats are identified, DHS works with partners to interdict them through strengthened interdiction, investigations, and prosecutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Combating Transnational Organized Crime|url=https://www.dhs.gov/blog/2011/07/25/combating-transnational-organized-crime|website=Department of Homeland Security|publisher=Department of Homeland Security|accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Department of State====
The [[Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs]] (INL), an agency of the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]], conducts CTOC operations at home and abroad by delivering justice and fairness and by strengthening police, courts, and corrections systems. These efforts reduce the amount of crime and illegal drugs reaching U.S. shores.&lt;ref name=DOS&gt;{{cite web|title=DoS CTOC efforts|url=https://www.state.gov/j/inl/|website=Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL)|publisher=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

INL CTOC efforts include helping foreign governments build effective law enforcement institutions that combat transnational organized crime, everything from money laundering, cybercrime, and intellectual property theft to trafficking in goods, people, weapons, drugs, or endangered wildlife. INL combats corruption by helping governments build transparent and accountable public institutions—a cornerstone of strong, stable, and fair societies that offer a level playing field for U.S. businesses abroad.&lt;ref name=DOS /&gt;

====Department of Treasury====
Established in 1990, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) provides investigative support to law enforcement, intelligence, and regulatory agencies, cooperating globally with counterpart financial intelligence units (FIUs), and uses its regulatory authorities to make it more difficult for organized criminal groups to move money through the financial system. FinCEN supports the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]]'s efforts to promote the adoption of international standards involving anti-money laundering and the counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT), including through the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) where FinCEN led the delegation from 1994 through 1998. The National Security Council identified FinCEN as one of 34 Federal entities that it considered as having a significant role in the fight against international crime as noted in an August 2001 Government Accountability Office report.

In 2012, the Department of Treasury imposed sanctions on four key transnational organized crime groups: [[Camorra]] from [[Italy]], [[Brothers' Circle]] from [[Russia]], the [[Yamaguchi-gumi]] ([[Yakuza]]) from Japan, and [[Los Zetas]] from [[Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cohen|first=David|title=Combating Transnational Organized Crime|url=http://www.treasury.gov/connect/blog/Pages/Combating-Transnational-Organized-Crime.aspx|publisher=[[United States Department of the Treasury]]|accessdate=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Drug Enforcement Administration====
The strength and sophistication of a task force's capabilities will be stronger than any single agency's if the task force is multijurisdictional, combining investigative resources from several agencies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/nsc/transnational-crime&lt;/ref&gt; The key element in finding out possible links between local crimes and crimes with transnational component is collaboration among law enforcement agencies. To illustrate further, Operation Trifecta, a 19-month transnational investigation led by the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), involved 9 Federal agencies and 67 State and local law enforcement agencies from 8 States. In 2003, it led to the arrests of some 240 individuals charged with transnational drug trafficking.

====Federal Bureau of Investigation====
Law enforcement agencies such as the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) are employed by nation-states to counteract international organized crime. Serious international crime—such as crimes against humanity—may be investigated by the International Criminal Court, but that Court does not have the power to take suspects into custody, instead relying on the support of law enforcement and military force in relevant countries.

==International Enforcement Agencies==

===United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime===
On November 15, 2000, the [[United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime]] (UNTOC) was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] and is appointed to serve as the most significant mechanism for fighting TOC internationally. The first of its kind, the convention identified TOC as criminal actions that cannot be sufficiently combated by pacts tailored to a single commercial enterprise.&lt;ref name=UNTOC&gt;{{cite web|title=The Global Regime for Transnational Crime|url=http://www.cfr.org/transnational-crime/global-regime-transnational-crime/p28656|website=Council on Foreign Relations|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ad Hoc Committee was established by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] to deal with this problem by taking a series of measures against transnational organized crime. These include the creation of domestic criminal offences to combat the problem, and the adoption of new, sweeping frameworks for mutual legal assistance, extradition, law-enforcement cooperation, and technical assistance and training.

{{citation needed span|text=A recent report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime highlighted that Southeast Asia produced an estimated 48 tons of heroin in 2011. The vast majority of this cultivation – roughly twice that of Afghanistan, which arguably receives much greater attention – has occurred in the fragile state of Myanmar. The UN report estimated that the revenue generated from this trade to be worth $16.3 billion during the same period.

The revenues generated from such trafficking often lie at the root of instability and violence in the region. Additionally, the same routes used to smuggle drugs will likely be used to transport weapons and militants in the event that the current conflict expands. Reconciling the numerous armed ethnic groups that exist within Myanmar continues to be a challenge for the nascent government. A strong drug trade will only complicate negotiations between government officials and these groups.|date=October 2016}}

Combating TOC internationally proves difficult because so many governments and economies benefit enormously from TOC. For example, the Russia government benefits from money gained through cybercrime and through ties between TOC and it energy exporters. China’s economy also benefits from cybercrime as well as from counterfeiting. West African and Latin American politicians are either coerced by or maintain financially beneficial relationships with drug traffickers.&lt;ref name=UNTOC /&gt;

UNTOC ability to help combat CTOC is compounded by its inability to directly assist countries that are incapable of adhering to the convention’s guidelines. Most countries agreed for a necessary, innovative, and more strategic approach at the 2010 conference of parties, yet to date no significant employment of tactics or policy has been determined. Voluntary contributions account for nearly all of UNODC’s funding and the organization suffers from chronic funding and staffing shortages. This limits UNODC’s overall effectiveness.&lt;ref name=UNTOC /&gt;

The UN General Assembly has also issued many resolutions to combat TOC; however, most have been ineffective because of their vagueness and irrelevancy.&lt;ref name=UNTOC /&gt;

===Interpol===
The idea of the organization known today as [[Interpol]] was born at the first International Criminal Police Congress, held in Monaco in 1914. It was officially created in 1923 with the name, International Criminal Police Commission, and renamed in 1956 with the name, Interpol. Today, it is the largest international police organization in the world and is made up of 190 member nations. Each member nation staffs a national central bureau that communicates and cooperates with other member nations. Its mission is ''""Preventing and fighting crime through enhanced cooperation and innovation on police and security matters"''.&lt;ref name=Interpol2&gt;{{cite web|title=Interpol Overview|url=http://www.interpol.int/About-INTERPOL/Overview|website=Interpol|publisher=Interpol|accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the organization Interpol exists to coordinate intelligence efforts between national law enforcement agencies, it is not an international police force{{clarify|date=October 2016}}, and indeed no such international law enforcement body with universal jurisdiction exists.

The agency's number one priority is to maintain a secure global police information system between the National Central Bureaus of each member nation. In addition to this priority, Interpol provides round-the-clock support to police and law enforcement agencies of all member nations. It also continuously attempts to innovate and enhance the tools used to fight crime and it assists in the identification of crimes and criminals.  Finally, it delivers high-level training, certification and accreditation to law enforcement personnel.&lt;ref name=Interpol2 /&gt;

Like most international CTOC organizations, Interpol suffers from continuously high levels of underfunding. In 2010, it operated on roughly $75 million budget. Since it holds no authority to conduct independent investigations or to arrest suspects, it is only as strong as the host country's police force.&lt;ref name=Interpol2 /&gt;

===World Bank===
With a membership of 188 nations, the [[World Bank]] is nearly the same size as Interpol (190) and although CTOC is not its primary mission, the World Bank does attempt to combat TOC by conducting assessments of anti-money laundering provisions and carrying out anti-corruption efforts. Its efforts are hindered, however, by the lack of concrete mandates and authorities. In a 2009 World Bank paper entitled, "Slavery and Human Trafficking International Law and the Role of the World Bank", the author states that "the World Bank’s mandate appears to permit preventive action", thereby lending doubt whether or not the World Bank is even permitted by UN mandate to involve itself in the fight against human trafficking.&lt;ref name=WorldBank&gt;{{cite web|title=Slavery and Human Trafficking  International Law and the  Role of the World Bank|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/SOCIALPROTECTION/Resources/SP-Discussion-papers/Labor-Market-DP/0904.pdf|website=World Bank|publisher=World Bank|accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recognizing the detrimental impact on its mission{{clarify|date=October 2016}}, the World Bank made a $1.5 billion pledge in 2011 to help combat TOC in the coming years.&lt;ref name=UNTOC /&gt;

In another CTOC initiative, the World Bank is partnered with the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] in the Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative (StAR). This initiative helps to recover corruption related proceeds by creating an effective and collaborative environment for global law enforcement policy development.&lt;ref name=WorldBank /&gt;

===International Monetary Fund===
The [[International Monetary Fund]] also conducts assessments of anti-money laundering provisions in countries.&lt;ref name="UNTOC"/&gt;

===Europol===
[[Europol]] is the law enforcement agency of the [[European Union|European Union (EU)]] whose main goal is to help achieve a safer Europe for the benefit of all EU citizens. The organization does so by assisting the EU Member States in their fight against serious international crime and terrorism.&lt;ref name=Europol&gt;{{cite web|title=About Europol|url=https://www.europol.europa.eu/content/page/about-europol-17|website=Europol|publisher=Europol|accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Europol officers hold no authority to conduct arrests but they support EU law enforcement colleagues by gathering, analyzing and disseminating information and coordinating operations. Europol uses the information to prevent, detect and investigate offenses, and to track down and prosecute those who commit them. Europol experts and analysts take part in Joint Investigation Teams which help solve criminal cases on the spot in EU countries.&lt;ref name=Europol /&gt;

===Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering===
The [[Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering|Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF)]], an initiative of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), is an inter-governmental body established in 1989 by the Ministers of its Member jurisdictions. The objectives of the FATF are to ''"set standards and promote effective implementation of legal, regulatory and operational measures for combating money laundering, terrorist financing and other related threats to the integrity of the international financial system."'' To this end, the FATF developed a number of recommendations that have been recognized by law enforcement agencies around the world as the standard in the combating of TOC; specifically in the fight against money laundering, terror financing, and the proliferation of [[weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]].&lt;ref name=FATF&gt;{{cite web|title=Who is FATF|url=http://www.fatf-gafi.org/pages/aboutus/|website=FATF|publisher=FATF|accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To help combat CTOC, the FATF maintains a policy that has proven successful thus far, in which it "names and shames" that jurisdictions that choose to not cooperate with FATF. It also enlists the help of cooperating countries in the crafting of legislative frameworks used in the effort to combat money laundering.&lt;ref name=FATF/&gt;

[[File:Voice of America Bethany Relay Station.jpg|thumb|250px|The National Voice of America Museum of Broadcasting is the main building and campus of the original VOA, Bethany Relay Station.]]
'''The [[Voice of America]]'s Bethany Relay Station''' was located in [[Butler County, Ohio]]'s [[West Chester Township, Butler County, Ohio|Union Township]] about 25 miles (40&amp;nbsp;km) north of [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]], adjacent to the transmitter site of [[WLW]]. Starting in 1944 during [[World War II]] it transmitted American radio programming abroad on [[shortwave]] frequencies, using 200,000-watt transmitters built by [[Crosley Broadcasting Corporation|Crosley]] engineers under the direction of R.J. Rockwell. The site was developed to provide 'fallback' transmission facilities inland and away from the East Coast, where transmitters were located in Massachusetts, on Long Island in New York, and in New Jersey, all close to the ocean, subject to attack from German submarines or other invading forces.

Programming originated from studios in New York until 1954, when VOA headquarters moved to Washington.

The station operated until 1994. The facility took its name from the [[Liberty Township, Butler County, Ohio|Liberty Township]] community of [[Bethany, Ohio|Bethany]], which was about two miles north of the facility.

==History==
In 1943, the United States government bought nearly all of [[section (land)|Section]] 12 of Township 3, Range 2 of the [[Symmes Purchase]], the northeasternmost section of Union Township. From Hazel Beckley, 170 acres (688,000 m²) were purchased; from Philip Condon, 143 acres (579,000 m²); from Lola Gray Coy, 100 acres (405,000 m²); from John Miller, 69 acres (279,000 m²); and from Suzie Steinman, 142 acres (575,000 m²). The site was chosen for its elevation and its shallow bedrock and is today bounded by Tylersville Road on the south, Cox Road to the west, Liberty Way to the north, and [[Butler County, Ohio|Butler]]-[[Warren County, Ohio|Warren]] Road.

The transmitters were built by [[Powel Crosley Jr.]]'s [[Crosley Broadcasting Corporation]] about one mile west of the company's tower for [[WLW-AM]] in [[Mason, Ohio|Mason]]. The [[Office of War Information]] began broadcasting in July 1944 and [[Adolf Hitler]] is said to have denounced the "Cincinnati liars". Following the war, with the OWI abolished, the facility was taken over by the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] in 1945. It became part of the newly created [[United States Information Agency]] in 1953. The Crosley Broadcasting Corporation operated the facility for the government until November 1963, when the Voice of America assumed direct control.

At its peak the facility had six transmitters broadcasting with 250&amp;nbsp;kW and two transmitting with 50&amp;nbsp;kW.

The facility was closed on November 14, 1994; because of changing technologies, the transmissions shifted to [[satellite]]s. The towers were brought down from December 1997 to February 1998.

==Post-closing use==
Most of the land was turned over to the [[Butler County, Ohio|county]] and [[West Chester Township, Butler County, Ohio|township]] for use as a [[park]].

Part in the southwest corner was sold to developers who have erected a shopping center called the Voice of America Centre.

The [[Miami University Voice of America Learning Center]] opened on the site in January 2009.

==National Voice of America Museum of Broadcasting==
The 30,000 sq. ft. former Bethany Station building at 8070 Tylersville Road is being transformed into the National Voice of America Museum of Broadcasting, a historical center about the history of The Voice of America, radio and television.

Using a blueprint developed by Jack Rouse Associates, the facility features displays and interactive experiences that relate the story of the Voice of America and incorporate other related collections from Media Heritage and the Gray History of Wireless Museum in [[Cincinnati]].

Displays include the radio station control room, re-creations of radio and television studios from the 1920s through the present, [[Old-time radio]] memorabilia and from the early days of television, and displays about area pioneers in the development of radio technology.

An amateur radio club West Chester Amateur Radio Association, also operates a station using the callsign WC8VOA.

[[File:Indian Navy - World Environment Day - 2016 (1).jpg|thumb|World Environment Day in India]]
'''World Environment Day''' ('''WED''') is celebrated on the 5th of June every year, and is the [[United Nations|United Nation's]] principal vehicle for encouraging awareness and action for the [[environmental protection|protection of our environment]]. First held in 1974, it has been a flagship campaign for raising awareness on emerging [[environmental issue]]s from [[marine pollution]], human [[overpopulation]], and [[global warming]], to [[sustainable consumption]] and wildlife crime. WED has grown to become a global platform for public outreach, with participation from over 143 countries annually. Each year, WED has a new theme that major corporations, NGOs, communities, governments and celebrities worldwide adopt to advocate environmental causes.

==History==
World Environment Day [WED] was established by the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]] in 1972&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/events/environmentday/background.shtml|title=World Environment Day - 5 June|website=www.un.org|language=EN|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the first day of the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment|Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment]], resulting from discussions on the integration of human interactions and the environment. Two years later, in 1974 the first WED was held with the theme "Only One Earth". Even though WED celebration have been held annually since 1974, in 1987 the idea for rotating the center of these activities through selecting different host countries began.

== Annual themes and major initiatives and accomplishments ==
{{expand section|date=January 2016}}
For almost five decades, World Environment Day has been raising awareness, supporting action, and driving change. Here is a timeline of key accomplishments in WEDs’ history:
===2018===
The theme for 2018 is "Beat Plastic Pollution". The host nation is India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://worldenvironmentday.global/|title=World Environment Day|website=worldenvironmentday.global|language=en|access-date=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; By choosing this Theme, it is aimed that people may strive to change their everyday lives to reduce the heavy burden of [[plastic pollution]]. People should be free from the over-reliance on single-use or disposables, as they have severe environmental consequences.  We should liberate our natural places, our wildlife - and our own health from plastics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/world-environment-day-2018-live-updates-host-nation-india-focuses-on-beat-plastic-pollution-theme-1862462|title=World Environment Day 2018 LIVE: Host Nation India Focuses On 'Beat Plastic Pollution' Theme|work=NDTV.com|access-date=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indian government pledged to eliminate all single use of plastic in India by 2022.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/india-aims-to-partner-with-un-to-promote-use-of-solar-energy/articleshow/64476669.cms|title=India aims to partner with UN to promote use of solar energy|date=2018-06-06|work=The Economic Times|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2017===
The theme for 2017 was 'Connecting People to Nature – in the city and on the land, from the poles to the equator'. The host nation was Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldenvironmentday.global/host-country/canada-natural-heritage-heart-national-identit 2017 Host country named as Canada, UNEP, 31 Jan 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2016 ===
The 2016 WED was organized under the theme "Go wild for life". This edition of the WED aims to reduce and prevent the illegal trade in wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://sdg.iisd.org/events/world-environment-day-2016/|title=Event: World Environment Day 2016 {{!}} SDG Knowledge Hub {{!}} IISD|last=Hub|first=IISD's SDG Knowledge|access-date=2017-12-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Angola]] was chosen as the host country of the 2016 WED during the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference|COP21]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201512141926.html|title=Angola to Host World Environment Day in 2016|date=2015-12-14|work=Angola Press Agency (Luanda)|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.climateactionprogramme.org/news/angola_to_host_world_environment_day_2016|title=Angola to host World Environment Day 2016|last=Programme|first=Climate Action|website=www.climateactionprogramme.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Activities for world environment day in Bhopal (8).jpg|thumb|Activities for world environment day in [[Bhopal]]]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
Our cosmic oasis, cosmic blue pearl
the most beautiful planet in the universe
all the continents and the oceans 
united we stand as flora and fauna
united we stand as species of one earth
different cultures, beliefs and ways
we are humans, the earth is our home
all the people and the nations of the world
all for one and one for all
united we unfurl the blue flag.

'''World population milestones''' were unnoticed until the 20th  century, since there were no reliable data on [[global population]] dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;Vaclav Smil, [http://www.ippnw.org/pdf/mgs/5-2-smil.pdf "Global Population: Milestones, Hopes, and Concerns"], ''Medicine &amp; Global Survival'', October 1998; Vol. 5, No. 2, 105–108&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated that the population of the world reached one billion for the first time in 1804. It would be another 123 years before it reached two billion in 1927, but it took only 33 years to rise by another billion people, reaching three billion in 1960. Thereafter, the global population reached four billion in 1974, five billion in 1987, six billion in 1999 and, by some estimates, seven billion in October 2011 with other estimates being in March 2012.&lt;ref name=UN7bn&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-15459643 |title=Population seven billion: UN sets out challenges|date=26 October 2011|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2011-10-27}}
&lt;/ref&gt; It is projected to reach eight billion by 2024–2030. According to current projections, the world's population is likely to reach around nine billion by 2035–2050, with alternative scenarios ranging from a low of 7.4 billion to a high of more than 10.6 billion.&lt;!--Please don't cull these references. Readers need to see the resources for themselves, to see such things as prediction variation, stability, and source. If you are of a mind to do something, just elaborate on the text and spread the references out. It's what I'd do if I had the time, but this exercise has used up as much time as I can spare--&gt;&lt;ref name=WorldPopProspects&gt;

==Global billionth milestones==
There is no estimation for the exact day or month the world's population surpassed each of the one and two billion marks. The days of three and four billion were not officially noted, but the International Database of the [[United States Census Bureau]] places them in July 1959 and April 1974.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

===Five billion===
'''The Day of Five Billion''', 11 July 1987, was designated by the [[United Nations Population Fund]] as the approximate day on which [[world population]] reached five billion.  '''Matej Gašpar''' from [[Zagreb]], Croatia (then [[SR Croatia]], [[SFR Yugoslavia]]), was chosen as the symbolic 5-billionth person concurrently alive on [[Earth]].  The honor went to Zagreb because the [[1987 Summer Universiade]] was taking place in the city at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ankica Barbir-Mladinović|title=Petomilijarditi "Zemljanin": Ne slušati stereotipe|url=http://www.slobodnaevropa.org/content/petomilijarditi_zemljanin_ne_slusati_stereotipe/24269206.html|date=19 July 2011|accessdate=1 October 2011|language=Croatian|publisher=[[Radio Free Europe]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7DB123EF931A25754C0A961948260|title=And Baby Makes Five billion: U.N.

National or subnational governments have sometimes made similar designations based on the date estimated by a demographic agency. Some national milestones relate to [[citizen]]s rather than [[residency (domicile)|resident]]s.
