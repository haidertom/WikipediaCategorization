Various astronomical alignments and numerological formulae were proposed as pertaining to this date. A [[New Age]] interpretation held that the date marked the start of a period during which Earth and its inhabitants would undergo a positive physical or [[spiritual transformation]], and that 21 December 2012 would mark the beginning of a new era.&lt;ref name="anasatas" /&gt; Others suggested that the date marked the [[End time|end of the world]] or a similar catastrophe. Scenarios suggested for the end of the world included the arrival of the next [[solar maximum]], an interaction between [[Earth]] and the [[Sagittarius A*|black hole at the center of the galaxy]],&lt;ref name="NASA1" /&gt; or [[Nibiru cataclysm|Earth's collision with a mythical planet called Nibiru]].

Scholars from various disciplines quickly dismissed predictions of concomitant cataclysmic events as they arose. Professional [[Mayanist]] scholars stated that no extant [[Maya codices|classic Maya accounts]] forecast impending doom, and that the idea that the Long Count calendar ends in 2012 misrepresented [[Maya civilization#History|Maya history]] and culture,&lt;ref name="Milbrath" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stuart"&gt;David Stuart, ''The Order of Days: The Maya World and the Truth about 2012'', Harmony Books, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="webster" /&gt; while astronomers rejected the various proposed doomsday scenarios as [[pseudoscience]],&lt;ref name="Brown 2009"&gt;{{cite web|title=SI do not ♥ pseudo-science|first=Mike|last=Brown|url=http://www.mikebrownsplanets.com/2008/02/i-do-not-pseudo-science.html|year=2008|accessdate=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nibiru and Doomsday 2012: Questions and Answers" /&gt; easily refuted by elementary astronomical observations.&lt;ref name="NASA2" /&gt;

== Mesoamerican Long Count calendar ==
{{main|Mesoamerican Long Count calendar}}

December 2012 marked the conclusion of a ''[[b'ak'tun]]''—a time period in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar, used in [[Mesoamerica|Central America]] prior to the arrival of Europeans. Although the Long Count was most likely invented by the [[Olmec]],&lt;ref name="delara2006" /&gt; it has become closely associated with the [[Maya civilization]], whose classic period lasted from 250 to 900&amp;nbsp;AD.&lt;ref name="Population structure of the classic period Maya" /&gt; The [[Maya script|writing system]] of the classic Maya has been substantially deciphered,&lt;ref name="joyce" /&gt; meaning that a [[Text corpus|corpus]] of their written and inscribed material has survived from before the [[Spanish conquest of Yucatán|European conquest]].

Unlike the 260-day ''[[tzolk'in]]'' still used today among the Maya, the Long Count was linear rather than cyclical, and kept time roughly in units of 20: 20 days made a ''uinal'', 18 uinals (360 days) made a ''tun'', 20 tuns made a ''k'atun'', and 20 k'atuns (144,000 days or roughly 394 years) made up a ''b'ak'tun''. Thus, the Maya date of 8.3.2.10.15 represents 8 b'ak'tuns, 3 k'atuns, 2 tuns, 10 uinals and 15 days.{{sfn|Schele|Freidel|1990|p=246}}&lt;ref name="The Astronomical Insignificance of Maya Date 13.0.0.0.0" /&gt;

=== Apocalypse ===
[[File:Popol vuh.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The oldest surviving manuscript of the ''[[Popol Vuh]]'', dated to 1701|alt=an ancient manuscript page.]]

There is a strong tradition of "world ages" in Maya literature, but the record has been distorted, leaving several possibilities open to interpretation.{{sfn|Severin|1981|p=75}} According to the ''[[Popol Vuh]]'', a compilation of the [[Mesoamerican creation accounts|creation accounts]] of the [[K'iche' people|K'iche' Maya]] of the Colonial-era highlands, we are living in the fourth world.{{sfn|Schele|Freidel|1990|pp=429–430}} The ''Popol Vuh'' describes the gods first creating three failed worlds, followed by a successful fourth world in which humanity was placed. In the Maya Long Count, the previous world ended after 13 b'ak'tuns, or roughly 5,125 years.{{sfn|Freidel|Schele|Parker|1993|p=63}}{{ref label|A|Note a|a}} The Long Count's "zero date"{{ref label|B|Note b|b}}{{ref label|C|Note c|c}} was set at a point in the past marking the end of the third world and the beginning of the current one, which corresponds to 11 August 3114&amp;nbsp;BC in the [[proleptic Gregorian calendar]].{{sfn|Aveni|2009|p=46}}&lt;ref name=yucalandia/&gt; This means that the fourth world reached the end of its 13th b'ak'tun, or Maya date 13.0.0.0.0, on 21 December 2012. In 1957, Mayanist and astronomer [[Maud Worcester Makemson]] wrote that "the completion of a Great Period of 13 b'ak'tuns would have been of the utmost significance to the Maya."&lt;ref name="makemson1957" /&gt; In 1966, [[Michael D. Coe]] wrote in ''The Maya'' that "there is a suggestion&amp;nbsp;... that Armageddon would overtake the degenerate peoples of the world and all creation on the final day of the 13th [b'ak'tun]. Thus&amp;nbsp;... our present universe [would] be annihilated ... when the Great Cycle of the Long Count reaches completion."{{sfn|Coe|1966|p=149}}{{ref label|E|Note e|e}}

=== Objections ===
Coe's interpretation was repeated by other scholars through the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="carrasco1990" /&gt; In contrast, later researchers said that, while the end of the 13th b'ak'tun would perhaps be a cause for celebration,&lt;ref name="Milbrath" /&gt; it did not mark the end of the calendar.&lt;ref name="milbrath1999" /&gt; "There is nothing in the Maya or Aztec or ancient Mesoamerican prophecy to suggest that they prophesied a sudden or major change of any sort in 2012," said Mayanist scholar Mark Van Stone. "The notion of a 'Great Cycle' coming to an end is completely a modern invention."&lt;ref name="van" /&gt; In 1990, Mayanist scholars [[Linda Schele]] and David Freidel argued that the Maya "did not conceive this to be the end of creation, as many have suggested".{{sfn|Schele|Freidel|1990|pp=81–82, 430–431}} Susan Milbrath, [[curator]] of Latin American Art and Archaeology at the [[Florida Museum of Natural History]], stated that, "We have no record or knowledge that [the Maya] would think the world would come to an end" in 2012.&lt;ref name="Milbrath" /&gt; Sandra Noble, executive director of the Foundation for the Advancement of Mesoamerican Studies, said, "For the ancient Maya, it was a huge celebration to make it to the end of a whole cycle," and, "The 2012 phenomenon is a complete fabrication and a chance for a lot of people to cash in."&lt;ref name="Milbrath" /&gt; "There will be another cycle," said E. Wyllys Andrews V, director of the [[Tulane University]] Middle American Research Institute. "We know the Maya thought there was one before this, and that implies they were comfortable with the idea of another one after this."&lt;ref name="The Sky Is Not Falling" /&gt; Commenting on the new calendar found at [[Xultún]], one archaeologist said "The ancient Maya predicted the world would continue&amp;nbsp;– that 7,000 years from now, things would be exactly like this. We keep looking for endings. The Maya were looking for a guarantee that nothing would change. It's an entirely different mindset."&lt;ref name="NG120510" /&gt;

Several prominent individuals representing Maya of Guatemala decried the suggestion that the world would end with the 13th b'ak'tun. Ricardo Cajas, president of the ''Colectivo de Organizaciones Indígenas de Guatemala'', said the date did not represent an end of humanity but that the new cycle "supposes changes in human consciousness". Martín Sacalxot, of the office of the ''[[Procuraduría de los Derechos Humanos (Guatemala)|Procurador de los Derechos Humanos]]'' (Guatemala's Human Rights Ombudsman, PDH), said that the end of the calendar has nothing to do with the end of the world or the year 2012.&lt;ref name="prensalibre" /&gt;

=== Prior associations ===
The European association of the Maya with eschatology dates back to the time of [[Christopher Columbus]], who was compiling a work called ''[[Book of Prophecies|Libro de las profecías]]'' during the voyage in 1502 when he first heard about the "Maia" on [[Guanaja]], an island off the north coast of [[Honduras]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Hoopes 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by the writings of Bishop [[Pierre d'Ailly]], Columbus believed that his discovery of "most distant" lands (and, by extension, the Maya themselves) was prophesied and would bring about the [[Apocalypse]]. End-times fears were widespread during the early years of the [[Spanish Conquest]] as the result of popular [[astrology|astrological]] predictions in Europe of a second [[Great Flood]] for the year 1524.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

In the early 1900s, German scholar [[Ernst Förstemann]] interpreted the last page of the [[Dresden Codex]] as a representation of the end of the world in a cataclysmic flood. He made reference to the destruction of the world and an apocalypse, though he made no reference to the 13th b'ak'tun or 2012 and it was not clear that he was referring to a future event.&lt;ref&gt;Förstemann 1906: 264&lt;/ref&gt; His ideas were repeated by archaeologist [[Sylvanus Morley]],&lt;ref&gt;Morley 1915: 32&lt;/ref&gt; who directly paraphrased Förstemann and added his own embellishments, writing, "Finally, on the last page of the manuscript, is depicted the Destruction of the World&amp;nbsp;... Here, indeed, is portrayed with a graphic touch the final all-engulfing cataclysm" in the form of a great flood. These comments were later repeated in Morley's book, ''The Ancient Maya'', the first edition of which was published in 1946.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

== Maya references to b'ak'tun 13 ==
It is not certain what significance the classic [[Maya civilization|Maya]] gave to the 13th b'ak'tun.&lt;ref name="Houston1996" /&gt; Most classic Maya inscriptions are strictly historical and do not make any prophetic declarations.&lt;ref name="Houston1996" /&gt; Two items in the Maya classical corpus, however, do mention the end of the 13th b'ak'tun: Tortuguero Monument 6 and La Corona Hieroglyphic Stairway 12.

=== Tortuguero ===
The [[Tortuguero (Maya site)|Tortuguero]] site, which lies in southernmost [[Tabasco]], Mexico, dates from the 7th century AD and consists of a series of inscriptions mostly in honor of the contemporary ruler Bahlam Ajaw. One inscription, known as Tortuguero Monument 6, is the only inscription known to refer to b'ak'tun 13 in any detail. It has been partially defaced; Sven Gronemeyer and Barbara MacLeod have given this translation:

&lt;div style="width: 500px"&gt;
{{col-begin}}
{{col-2}}
: ''tzuhtzjo:m uy-u:xlaju:n pik''
: ''chan ajaw u:x uni:w''
: ''uhto:m il[?]''
: ''ye'ni/ye:n bolon yokte'''
: ''ta chak joyaj''
{{col-2}}
: It will be completed the 13th ''b'ak'tun''.
: It is 4 ''Ajaw'' 3 ''K'ank'in''
: and it will happen a 'seeing'[?].
: It is the display of ''B'olon-Yokte'''
: in a great "investiture".{{sfn|Gronemeyer|MacLeod|2010|p=8}}
{{col-end}}
&lt;/div&gt;

[[File:Bolon Yokte' K'uh.jpg|thumb|The Tortuguero monument connects the end of the 13th b'ak'tun with the appearance of B'olon Yokte' K'uh, shown here on the Vase of Seven Gods.|alt=Vase illustration in which the god Bolon Yukte is seen in profile, kneeling with his head back and his mouth open. He wears an elaborate feather headdress.]]

Very little is known about the god B'olon Yokte'. According to an article by Mayanists Markus Eberl and Christian Prager in ''British Anthropological Reports'', his name is composed of the elements "nine", 'OK-te' (the meaning of which is unknown), and "god". Confusion in classical period inscriptions suggests that the name was already ancient and unfamiliar to contemporary scribes.&lt;ref name="eberl2005" /&gt; He also appears in inscriptions from [[Palenque]], [[Usumacinta]], and [[La Mar]] as a god of war, conflict, and the underworld. In one [[Maya stelae|stele]] he is portrayed with a rope tied around his neck, and in another with an incense bag, together signifying a sacrifice to end a cycle of years.&lt;ref name="hieroglyphic" /&gt;

Based on observations of modern Maya rituals, Gronemeyer and MacLeod claim that the stela refers to a celebration in which a person portraying Bolon Yokte' K'uh was wrapped in ceremonial garments and paraded around the site.{{sfn|Gronemeyer|MacLeod|2010|pp=11, 36–37}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2011}} They note that the association of Bolon Yokte' K'uh with b'ak'tun 13 appears to be so important on this inscription that it supersedes more typical celebrations such as "erection of stelae, scattering of incense" and so forth. Furthermore, they assert that this event was indeed planned for 2012 and not the 7th century.{{sfn|Gronemeyer|MacLeod|2010|pp=24, 35}} Mayanist scholar [[Stephen D. Houston|Stephen Houston]] contests this view by arguing that future dates on Maya inscriptions were simply meant to draw parallels with contemporary events, and that the words on the stela describe a contemporary rather than a future scene.&lt;ref name="What Will Not Happen in 2012" /&gt;

=== La Corona ===
In April–May 2012, a team of archaeologists unearthed a previously unknown inscription on a stairway at the [[La Corona]] site in [[Guatemala]]. The inscription, on what is known as Hieroglyphic Stairway 12, describes the establishment of a royal court in [[Calakmul]] in 635 AD, and compares the then-recent completion of 13 k'atuns with the future completion of the 13th b'ak'tun. It contains no speculation or prophecy as to what the scribes believed would happen at that time.&lt;ref name="Stuart 2012"&gt;{{cite web | title = Notes on a New Text from La Corona | first = David | last = Stuart | url = http://decipherment.wordpress.com/ | year = 2012 | accessdate = 6 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dates beyond b'ak'tun 13 ===
Maya inscriptions occasionally mention predicted future events or commemorations that would occur on dates far beyond the completion of the 13th b'ak'tun. Most of these are in the form of "distance dates"; Long Count dates together with an additional number, known as a Distance Number, which when added to them makes a future date. On the west panel at the [[Temple of Inscriptions]] in Palenque, a section of text projects forward to the 80th 52-year [[Calendar Round]] from the coronation of the ruler [[K'inich Janaab' Pakal]]. Pakal's accession occurred on 9.9.2.4.8, equivalent to 27 July 615&amp;nbsp;AD in the proleptic Gregorian calendar. The inscription begins with Pakal's birthdate of 9.8.9.13.0 (24 March, {{nowrap|603&amp;nbsp;AD Gregorian}}) and then adds the Distance Number 10.11.10.5.8 to it,{{sfn|Schele|1992|pp=93–95}} arriving at a date of 21 October 4772&amp;nbsp;AD, more than 4,000 years after Pakal's time.&lt;ref name="van" /&gt;{{sfn|Schele|1992|pp=93–95}}{{sfn|Schele|Freidel|1990|p=430}}

Another example is Stela 1 at [[Coba]] which marks the date of creation as {{nowrap|13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.0.0.0.0}}, or nineteen units above the b'ak'tun. According to Linda Schele, these 13s represent "the starting point of a huge odometer of time", with each acting as a zero and resetting to 1 as the numbers increase.{{sfn|Schele|Freidel|1990|pp=81–82, 430–431}}{{ref label|C|Note c|c}} Thus this inscription anticipates the current universe lasting at least 20&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;×13×360 days,&lt;ref name=wagner/&gt; or roughly 2.687×10&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; years; a time span equal to 2 quintillion times the [[age of the universe]] as determined by cosmologists. Others have suggested, however, that this date marks creation as having occurred after that time span.&lt;ref name=wagner&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Maya Creation Myths and Cosmography|author=Wagner, Elizabeth|editor=Grube, Nikolai|title=Maya: Divine Kings of the Rainforest|page=283|year=2000|publisher=Konemann|isbn=978-3-8290-4150-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Aveni|2009|p=49}}

In 2012, researchers announced the discovery of a series of Maya astronomical tables in [[Xultún]], Guatemala which plot the movements of the Moon and other astronomical bodies over the course of 17 b'ak'tuns.&lt;ref name="NG120510"&gt;{{cite web | last = Vance | first = Eric | title = Unprecedented Maya Mural Found, Contradicts 2012 "Doomsday" Myth |work=National Geographic |date=10 May 2012 | url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/05/120510-maya-2012-doomsday-calendar-end-of-world-science/ |accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Saturno et al. 11 May 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Science | date = 11 May 2012 | volume = 336 | issue = 6082 | pages = 714–717 | doi = 10.1126/science.1221444 | title = Ancient Maya Astronomical Tables from Xultun, Guatemala |author1=William A.

The general intent of this literature was not to warn of impending doom but "to foster counter-cultural sympathies and eventually socio-political and 'spiritual' activism".&lt;ref name="skepsis" /&gt; Aveni, who has studied New Age and [[search for extraterrestrial intelligence]] (SETI) communities, describes 2012 narratives as the product of a "disconnected" society: "Unable to find spiritual answers to life's big questions within ourselves, we turn outward to imagined entities that lie far off in space or time—entities that just might be in possession of superior knowledge."{{sfn|Aveni|2009|p=161}}

=== Origins ===
In 1975, the ending of b'ak'tun 13 became the subject of speculation by several New Age authors, who asserted it would correspond with a global "transformation of consciousness". In ''Mexico Mystique: The Coming Sixth Age of Consciousness'', [[Frank Waters]] tied Coe's original date of 24 December 2011{{ref label|E|Note e|e}} to astrology and the prophecies of the [[Hopi]],&lt;ref name="particular" /&gt; while both [[José Argüelles]] (in ''The Transformative Vision'')&lt;ref name="elles1975" /&gt; and [[Terence McKenna]] (in ''The Invisible Landscape'')&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mckenna1993" /&gt; discussed the significance of the year 2012 without mentioning a specific day.

In 1983, with the publication of [[Robert J. Sharer]]'s revised table of date correlations in the 4th edition of Morley's ''The Ancient Maya,''{{ref label|E|Note e|e}} each became convinced that 21 December 2012 had significant meaning. By 1987, the year in which he organized the [[Harmonic Convergence]] event, Arguelles was using the date 21 December 2012 in ''The Mayan Factor: Path Beyond Technology''.&lt;ref name="Planets Won't Attend Astronomical Celebration" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elles1987" /&gt; He claimed that on 13 August 3113 BC the Earth began a passage through a "galactic synchronization beam" that emanated from the [[Galactic Center|center of our galaxy]], that it would pass through this beam during a period of 5200 ''tuns'' (Maya cycles of 360 days each), and that this beam would result in "total synchronization" and "galactic entrainment" of individuals "plugged into the Earth's electromagnetic battery" by 13.0.0.0.0 (21 December 2012). He believed that the Maya aligned their calendar to correspond to this phenomenon.&lt;ref name="scare" /&gt; Anthony Aveni has dismissed all of these ideas.{{sfn|Aveni|2009|pp=17–27}}

In 2006, author [[Daniel Pinchbeck]] popularized New Age concepts about this date in his book ''2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl'', linking b'ak'tun 13 to beliefs in [[crop circles]], [[alien abduction]], and personal revelations based on the use of [[hallucinogenic drugs]] and [[mediumship]].&lt;ref name="Pinchbeck 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The End of the World As They Know It" /&gt; Pinchbeck claims to discern a "growing realization that materialism and the rational, empirical worldview that comes with it has reached its expiration date&amp;nbsp;... [w]e're on the verge of transitioning to a dispensation of consciousness that's more intuitive, mystical and shamanic".&lt;ref name="anasatas" /&gt;

=== Galactic alignment ===
There is no significant astronomical event tied to the Long Count's start date.{{sfn|Aveni|2009|p=83}} However, its supposed end date was tied to astronomical phenomena by [[esoteric]], [[fringe science|fringe]], and [[New Age]] literature that placed great significance on [[astrology]], especially astrological interpretations associated with the phenomenon of [[axial precession]].&lt;ref name="Hoopes2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoopes2012" /&gt; Chief among these ideas is the astrological concept of a "galactic alignment".

==== Precession ====
In the [[Solar System]], the planets and the [[Sun]] lie roughly within the same flat plane, known as the [[plane of the ecliptic]]. From our perspective on [[Earth]], the [[ecliptic]] is the path taken by the Sun across the sky over the course of the year. The twelve [[constellation]]s that line the ecliptic are known as the [[zodiac]]al constellations and, annually, the Sun passes through all of them in turn. Additionally, over time, the Sun's annual cycle appears to recede very slowly backward by one degree every 72 years, or by one constellation approximately every 2,160 years. This backward movement, called "[[Precession of the equinoxes|precession]]", is due to a slight wobble in the Earth's axis as it spins, and can be compared to the way a [[spinning top]] wobbles as it slows down.&lt;ref name="prec" /&gt; Over the course of 25,800 years, a period often called a [[Great Year]], the Sun's path completes a full, 360-degree backward rotation through the zodiac.&lt;ref name="prec" /&gt; In Western astrological traditions, precession is measured from the [[March equinox]], one of the two annual points at which the Sun is exactly halfway between its lowest and highest points in the sky. At the end of the 20th century and beginning of the 21st, the Sun's March equinox position was in the constellation [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]] moving back into [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]]. This signaled the end of one [[astrological age]] (the Age of Pisces) and the beginning of another (the [[Age of Aquarius]]).{{sfn|Spencer|2000|pp=115–127}}

Similarly, the Sun's December [[solstice]] position (in the northern hemisphere, the lowest point on its annual path; in the southern hemisphere, the highest) was in the constellation of [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]], one of two constellations in which the zodiac intersects with the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref name="Teapot of Sagittarius points to galactic center" /&gt; Every year, on the December solstice, the Sun and the Milky Way, appear (from the surface of the Earth) to come into alignment, and every year precession caused a slight shift in the Sun's position in the Milky Way. Given that the Milky Way is between 10° and 20° wide, it takes between 700 and 1,400 years for the Sun's December solstice position to precess through it.&lt;ref name="What's going to happen on 21 December 2012?" /&gt; In 2012 it was about halfway through the Milky Way, crossing the [[galactic equator]].&lt;ref name="starry" /&gt; In 2012, the Sun's December solstice fell on 21 December.&lt;ref name="Questions and comments" /&gt;

==== Mysticism ====
[[File:Milkyway Swan Panorama.jpg|thumb|400px|The Milky Way near [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]] showing the lane of the [[Great Rift (astronomy)|Dark Rift]], which the Maya called the ''Xibalba be'' or "Black Road"|alt=a photograph of the Milky Way, rotated 90 degrees]]

Mystical speculations about the [[precession]] of the equinoxes and the Sun's proximity to the center of the Milky Way appeared in ''[[Hamlet's Mill]]'' (1969) by [[Giorgio de Santillana]] and Hertha von Deschend. These were quoted and expanded upon by [[Terence McKenna|Terence]] and [[Dennis McKenna]] in ''The Invisible Landscape'' (1975). 

Adherents to the idea, following a theory first proposed by [[Munro Edmonson]],{{sfn|Edmonson|1988|p=119}} alleged that the Maya based their calendar on observations of the [[Great Rift (astronomy)|Great Rift]] or Dark Rift, a band of dark dust clouds in the Milky Way, which, according to some scholars, the Maya called the ''[[Xibalba|Xibalba be]]'' or "Black Road".&lt;ref name="Xibalba or Xibalbe" /&gt; John Major Jenkins claims that the Maya were aware of where the ecliptic intersected the Black Road and gave this position in the sky a special significance in their cosmology.&lt;ref name="Jenkins2012" /&gt; Jenkins said that precession would align the Sun precisely with the galactic equator at the 2012 winter solstice.&lt;ref name="Jenkins2012" /&gt; Jenkins claimed that the classical Maya anticipated this conjunction and celebrated it as the harbinger of a profound spiritual transition for mankind.&lt;ref name="The Mayan Calendar and the Transformation of Consciousness" /&gt; New Age proponents of the galactic alignment hypothesis argued that, just as astrology uses the positions of stars and planets to make claims of future events, the Maya plotted their calendars with the objective of preparing for significant world events.&lt;ref name="pinchbeck2006" /&gt; Jenkins attributed the insights of ancient Maya [[shamans]] about the [[galactic center]] to their use of [[psilocybin mushrooms]], [[psychoactive toad]]s, and other [[psychedelics]].&lt;ref name="jenkins1998" /&gt; Jenkins also associated the ''Xibalba be'' with a "world tree", drawing on studies of contemporary (not ancient) Maya cosmology.{{sfn|Aveni|2009|p=62}}

==== Criticism ====
Astronomers such as [[David Morrison (astrophysicist)|David Morrison]] argue that the galactic equator is an entirely arbitrary line and can never be precisely drawn, because it is impossible to determine the Milky Way's exact boundaries, which vary depending on clarity of view. Jenkins claimed he drew his conclusions about the location of the galactic equator from observations taken at above {{convert|11000|ft|m}}, an altitude that gives a clearer image of the Milky Way than the Maya had access to.&lt;ref name="scare" /&gt; Furthermore, since the Sun is half a degree wide, its solstice position takes 36 years to precess its full width. Jenkins himself noted that even given his determined location for the line of the galactic equator, its most precise convergence with the center of the Sun already occurred in 1998, and so asserts that, rather than 2012, the galactic alignment instead focuses on a multi-year period centered in 1998.&lt;ref name="jenk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The True Alignment Zone" /&gt;&lt;ref name="meeus1997" /&gt;

There is no clear evidence that the classic Maya were aware of precession. Some Maya scholars, such as Barbara MacLeod,{{sfn|MacLeod|2011}} Michael Grofe,&lt;ref name="grofe2011" /&gt; Eva Hunt, Gordon Brotherston, and Anthony Aveni,&lt;ref name="jenkins2009" /&gt; have suggested that some Mayan holy dates were timed to precessional cycles, but scholarly opinion on the subject remains divided.&lt;ref name="van" /&gt; There is also little evidence, archaeological or historical, that the Maya placed any importance on solstices or equinoxes.&lt;ref name="van" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Aimers, J. J., and Rice, P. M. 2006 79–96" /&gt; It is possible that only the earliest among Mesoamericans observed solstices,{{refn|{{harvnb|Aveni|2009|pp=54–55}}, citing {{harvnb|Aveni|Hartung|2000}}.}} but this is also a disputed issue among Mayanists.&lt;ref name="van" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Aimers, J. J., and Rice, P. M. 2006 79–96" /&gt; There is also no evidence that the classic Maya attached any importance to the Milky Way; there is no glyph in their writing system to represent it, and no astronomical or chronological table tied to it.{{sfn|Aveni|2009|p=57}}

=== Timewave zero and the ''I Ching'' ===
{{Main|Terence McKenna#Novelty theory and Timewave Zero}}
[[File:Timewave 9 11 2001.png|thumb|A screenshot of the "Timewave Zero" software|alt=a greyscale graph with multiple, jagged peaks and troughs and an overall descending pattern, set amidst complex virtual instrumentation]]
"Timewave zero" is a [[numerology|numerological]] formula that purports to calculate the ebb and flow of "novelty", defined as increase over time in the [[universe]]'s interconnectedness, or [[Complexity#Disorganized complexity vs. organized complexity|organized complexity]].&lt;ref name="TMobAB" /&gt; [[Terence McKenna]] claimed that the universe has a [[teleological]] [[attractor]] at the [[Ultimate fate of the universe|end of time]] that increases interconnectedness. He believed this which would eventually reach a [[technological singularity|singularity]] of infinite complexity in 2012, at which point anything and everything imaginable would occur simultaneously. He conceived this idea over several years in the early to mid-1970s whilst using psilocybin mushrooms and [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]].&lt;ref name="TMobAB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whitesides2012" /&gt; The [[scientific community]] considers novelty theory to be [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref name=bruce&gt;{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=A. |year=2009 |title=2012: Science Or Superstition (the Definitive Guide to the Doomsday Phenomenon) |publisher=The Disinformation Company |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N-rVUCO4YyYC&amp;pg=PA261|isbn=978-1-934708-51-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=normark&gt;{{cite web |title=2012: Prophet of nonsense #8: Terence McKenna – Novelty theory and timewave zero |last=Normark |first=Johan |url=http://haecceities.wordpress.com/2009/06/16/2012-prophet-of-nonsense-8-terence-mckenna%E2%80%93-novelty-theory-and-timewave-zero/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McKenna expressed "novelty" in a computer program which produces a waveform known as "timewave zero" or the "timewave". Based on McKenna's interpretation of the [[King Wen sequence]] of the ''[[I Ching]]'', an ancient Chinese book on [[divination]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; the graph purports to show great periods of novelty corresponding with major shifts in humanity's [[evolution|biological]] and [[sociocultural evolution|sociocultural]] evolution. He believed that the events of any given time are resonantly related to the events of other times, and chose the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Hiroshima]] as the basis for calculating his end date of November 2012.&lt;ref name="Dynamics of Hyperspace" /&gt; When he later discovered this date's proximity to the end of the 13th b'ak'tun of the Maya calendar, he revised his hypothesis so that the two dates matched.&lt;ref name="skepsis" /&gt;

The 1975 first edition of ''The Invisible Landscape'' referred to 2012 (but no specific day during the year) only twice. In the 1993 second edition, McKenna employed Sharer's date{{ref label|E|Note e|e}} of 21 December 2012 throughout.&lt;ref name="skepsis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whitesides2012" /&gt;

Novelty theory has been criticized for "rejecting countless ideas presumed as factual by the scientific community", depending "solely on numerous controversial deductions that contradict empirical logic", and encompassing "no suitable indication of truth", with the conclusion that novelty theory is a pseudoscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Smith II D.

The idea that the year 2012 presaged a world cataclysm, the end of the world, or the end of [[human civilization]], became a subject of popular media speculation as the date of 21 December 2012 approached. This idea was promulgated by many pages on the [[Internet]], particularly on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref name="foratv" /&gt; [[The Discovery Channel]] was criticized for its "quasi-documentaries" about the subject that "sacrifice[d] accuracy for entertainment".&lt;ref name="PressSunBulletin"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pressconnects.com/article/20121210/NEWS01/312110007/Cornell-Maya-expert-World-probably-won-t-end-Dec-21?odyssey=nav%7Chead|title=Cornell Maya expert: World probably won't end Dec. 21 |last=D.W.

=== Other alignments ===
Some people interpreted the galactic alignment apocalyptically, claiming that its occurrence would somehow create a combined [[gravitation]]al effect between the Sun and the [[supermassive black hole]] at the center of our galaxy (known as [[Sagittarius A*]]), creating havoc on Earth.&lt;ref name="krupp" /&gt; Apart from the "galactic alignment" already having happened in 1998, the Sun's apparent path through the zodiac as seen from Earth did not take it near the true galactic center, but rather several degrees above it.&lt;ref name="starry" /&gt; Even were this not the case, Sagittarius A* is 30,000 [[light year]]s from Earth; it would have to have been more than 6 million times closer to cause any gravitational disruption to Earth's Solar System.&lt;ref name="Questions answered" /&gt;&lt;ref name="What would happen if a supermassive black hole came close to the Earth?" /&gt; This reading of the alignment was included on the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] documentary ''Decoding the Past''. John Major Jenkins complained that a science fiction writer co-authored the documentary, and he went on to characterize it as "45&amp;nbsp;minutes of unabashed doomsday hype and the worst kind of inane sensationalism".&lt;ref name="How Not to Make a 2012 Documentary" /&gt;

Some believers in a 2012 doomsday used the term "galactic alignment" to describe a different phenomenon proposed by some scientists to explain a pattern in [[mass extinction]]s supposedly observed in the [[fossil record]].&lt;ref name="fraser" /&gt; According to the [[Shiva Hypothesis]], mass extinctions are not random, but recur every 26 million years. To account for this, it was suggested that vertical oscillations made by the Sun on its [[Galactic year|250-million-year orbit]] of the galactic center cause it to regularly pass through the galactic plane. When the Sun's orbit takes it outside the galactic plane which bisects the [[galactic disc]], the influence of the [[galactic tide]] is weaker. However, when re-entering the galactic disc—as it does every 20–25&amp;nbsp;million years—it comes under the influence of the far stronger "disc tides", which, according to mathematical models, increase the flux of [[Oort cloud]] comets into the inner Solar System by a factor of 4, thus leading to a massive increase in the likelihood of a devastating comet impact.&lt;ref name="Perturbing the Oort Cloud" /&gt; However, this "alignment" takes place over tens of millions of years, and could never be timed to an exact date.&lt;ref name="Galactic Plane" /&gt; Evidence shows that the Sun passed through the plane bisecting the galactic disc three million years ago and in 2012 was moving farther above it.&lt;ref name="The Sun's motion perpendicular to the galactic plane" /&gt;

A third suggested alignment was some sort of planetary [[Conjunction (astronomy and astrology)|conjunction]] occurring on 21 December 2012; however, there was no conjunction on that date.&lt;ref name="Nibiru and Doomsday 2012: Questions and Answers" /&gt; Multi-planet alignments did occur in both 2000 and 2010, each with no ill result for the Earth.&lt;ref name="Planetary Alignment" /&gt; [[Jupiter]] is the [[List of Solar System objects by size#Objects above ≈300&amp;nbsp;km in radius|largest]] planet in the Solar System; larger than all other planets combined. When Jupiter is near [[Opposition (planets)|opposition]], the difference in gravitational force that the Earth experiences is less than 1% of the force that the Earth feels daily from the Moon.&lt;ref name="Plait-alignment" /&gt;

=== Geomagnetic reversal ===
Another idea tied to 2012 involved a [[geomagnetic reversal]] (often referred to as a [[pole shift]] by proponents), possibly triggered by a massive [[solar flare]], that would release an energy equal to 100&amp;nbsp;billion [[atomic bombs]].&lt;ref name="2012: No Killer Solar Flare" /&gt; This belief was supposedly supported by observations that the Earth's [[magnetic field]] was weakening,&lt;ref name="Rapidly changing flows in the Earth's core" /&gt; which could precede a reversal of the north and south [[Poles of astronomical bodies|magnetic poles]], and the arrival of the next [[solar maximum]], which was expected sometime around 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar Storm Warning|publisher=NASA|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2006/10mar_stormwarning/|year=2006|accessdate=22 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most scientific estimates, however, say that geomagnetic reversals take between 1,000 and 10,000 years to complete,&lt;ref name="Merrill"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Merrill | first1 = Ronald T. | last2 = McElhinny | first2 = Michael W. | last3 = McFadden | first3 = Philip L. | title = The magnetic field of the earth: paleomagnetism, the core, and the deep mantle|publisher=[[Academic Press]] | year = 1998|isbn=978-0-12-491246-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and do not start on any particular date.&lt;ref name="Geomagnetic Reversal" /&gt; Furthermore, the U.S. [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] predicted that the solar maximum would peak in late 2013 or 2014, and that it would be fairly weak, with a below-average number of [[sunspots]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar Maximum: Three Solar Flares And A Coronal Mass Ejection As The Sun Reaches Peak Solar Activity|publisher=NASA|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/solar-maximum-three-solar-flares-coronal-mass-ejection-sun-reaches-peak-solar-activity-1442608|year=2013|accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, there was no scientific evidence linking a solar maximum to a geomagnetic reversal, which is driven by forces entirely within the Earth.&lt;ref name="2012: No Geomagnetic Reversal" /&gt; Instead, a solar maximum would be mostly notable for its effects on satellite and cellular phone communications.&lt;ref name="goemag" /&gt; David Morrison attributed the rise of the solar storm idea to physicist and science popularizer [[Michio Kaku]], who claimed in an interview with [[Fox News]] that a solar peak in 2012 could be disastrous for orbiting satellites, and to NASA's headlining a 2006 webpage as "Solar Storm Warning", a term later repeated on several doomsday pages.&lt;ref name="foratv" /&gt;

=== Planet X/Nibiru ===
{{main|Nibiru cataclysm}}

Some believers in a 2012 doomsday claimed that a planet called Planet&amp;nbsp;X, or Nibiru, would collide with or pass by the Earth. This idea, which appeared in various forms since 1995, initially predicted Doomsday in May 2003, but proponents abandoned that date after it passed without incident.&lt;ref name="morrison" /&gt; The idea originated from claims of channeling [[grey aliens|alien beings]] and is widely ridiculed.&lt;ref name="morrison" /&gt;{{sfn|Schilling|2008|p=111}} Astronomers calculated that such an object so close to Earth would be visible to anyone looking up at the night sky.&lt;ref name="morrison" /&gt;

=== Other catastrophes ===
[[File:Pleiades large.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Pleiades]], a [[star cluster]] with supposed influence sometimes tied to the 2012 event|alt=The Pleiades star cluster]]

Author [[Graham Hancock]], in his book ''[[Fingerprints of the Gods]]'', interpreted Coe's remarks in ''Breaking the Maya Code''{{sfn|Coe|1992|pp=275–276}} as evidence for the prophecy of a global cataclysm.&lt;ref name="hancock" /&gt; Filmmaker [[Roland Emmerich]] later credited the book with inspiring his 2009 [[disaster film]] ''[[2012 (film)|2012]]''.&lt;ref name="chicagoscifi credits"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://chicagoscifi.com/movies/0011/presskit_pages/credits.pdf | title = 2012 (2009)&amp;nbsp;– Credit List |accessdate=25 November 2009 |publisher=chicagoscifi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other speculations regarding doomsday in 2012 included predictions by the [[Web Bot]] project, a computer program that purports to predict the future by analyzing Internet chatter. However, commentators have rejected claims that the bot is able to predict natural disasters, as opposed to human-caused disasters like stock market crashes.&lt;ref name="'Web-bot project' makes prophecy of 2012 apocalypse" /&gt;

The 2012 date was also loosely tied to the long-running concept of the [[Photon Belt]], which predicted a form of interaction between Earth and [[Alcyone (star)|Alcyone]], the largest star of the [[Pleiades cluster]].&lt;ref name="morris2" /&gt; Critics argued that photons cannot form belts, that the Pleiades, located more than 400 light years away, could have no effect on Earth, and that the Solar System, rather than getting closer to the Pleiades, was in fact moving farther away from it.&lt;ref name="Is the earth about to enter the Photon Belt, causing the end of life as we know it?" /&gt;

Some media outlets tied the fact that the [[red supergiant]] star [[Betelgeuse]] would undergo a [[supernova]] at some point in the future to the 2012 phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Connelly 19 January 2011"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/technology/sci-tech/tatooines-twin-suns-coming-to-a-planet-near-you-just-as-soon-as-betelgeuse-explodes/story-fn5fsgyc-1225991009247 |title=Tatooine's twin suns&amp;nbsp;– coming to a planet near you just as soon as Betelgeuse explodes |last=Connelly |first=Claire |work=News.com.au |date=19 January 2011 |accessdate=14 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922083805/http://www.news.com.au/technology/sci-tech/tatooines-twin-suns-coming-to-a-planet-near-you-just-as-soon-as-betelgeuse-explodes/story-fn5fsgyc-1225991009247 |archivedate=22 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while Betelgeuse was certainly in the final stages of its life, and would die as a supernova, there was no way to predict the timing of the event to within 100,000 years.&lt;ref name="Betelgeuse and 2012" /&gt; To be a threat to Earth, a supernova would need to be no further than 25 light years from the Solar System. Betelgeuse is roughly 600 light years away, and so its supernova would not affect Earth.&lt;ref name="Is Betelgeuse about to blow?" /&gt; In December 2011, NASA's [[Francis Reddy]] issued a press release debunking the possibility of a supernova occurring in 2012.&lt;ref name="Reddy 2011"&gt;{{cite web | title = 2012: Fear No Supernova | publisher = NASA | last = Reddy | first = Francis | url = http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/2012-supernova.html | year = 2011 | accessdate = 23 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another claim involved [[alien invasion]]. In December 2010, an article, first published in [[examiner.com]] and later referenced in the English-language edition of ''[[Pravda]]''&lt;ref name="NO Spaceships Headed for Earth" /&gt; claimed, citing a Second [[Digitized Sky Survey]] photograph as evidence, that SETI had detected three large spacecraft due to arrive at Earth in 2012.&lt;ref name="philp" /&gt; Astronomer and debunker [[Phil Plait]] noted that by using the [[small-angle formula]], one could determine that if the object in the photo were as large as claimed, it would have had to be closer to Earth than the Moon, which would mean it would already have arrived.&lt;ref name="philp" /&gt; In January 2011, [[Seth Shostak]], chief astronomer of SETI, issued a press release debunking the claims.&lt;ref name="NO Spaceships Headed for Earth" /&gt;

Beginning in 2000, the small French village of [[Bugarach]], population 189, began receiving visits from "esoterics"—mystic believers who had concluded that the local mountain, [[Pic de Bugarach]], was the ideal location to weather the transformative events of 2012. In 2011, the local mayor, Jean-Pierre Delord, began voicing fears to the international press that the small town would be overwhelmed by an influx of thousands of visitors in 2012, even suggesting he might call in the army.&lt;ref name="For End of the World, a French Peak Holds Allure" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Samuel 2010" /&gt; "We've seen a huge rise in visitors", Delord told ''[[The Independent]]'' in March 2012. "Already this year more than 20,000 people have climbed right to the top, and last year we had 10,000 hikers, which was a significant rise on the previous 12 months. They think Pic de Bugarach is 'un garage à ovnis' [a garage for [[UFO]]s]. The villagers are exasperated: the exaggerated importance of something which they see as completely removed from reality is bewildering. After 21 December, this will surely return to normal."&lt;ref name=hippies /&gt; In December 2012, the French government placed 100 police and firefighters around both Bugarach and Pic de Bugarach, limiting access to potential visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mayan Doomsday: French Police Block Access to Survivors' Refuge Pic de Bugarach|author=Hanna Osborne|publisher=International Business Times|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/407669/20121122/mayan-prophecy-doomsday-pic-de-bugarach-aliens.htm|accessdate=13 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121129090241/http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/407669/20121122/mayan-prophecy-doomsday-pic-de-bugarach-aliens.htm|archivedate=29 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, only about 1,000 visitors appeared at the height of the "event".

== Cultural influence ==
The 2012 phenomenon was discussed or referenced in several media. Several TV documentaries, as well as some contemporary fictional references to the year 2012, referred to 21 December as the day of a cataclysmic event.

The [[UFO conspiracy]] TV series ''[[The X-Files]]'' cited 22 December 2012 as the date for an alien colonization of the Earth and mentioned the [[Mayan calendar]] "stopping" on this date.&lt;ref name="skepsis" /&gt; The [[History (U.S. TV network)|History Channel]] aired a handful of special series on doomsday that included analysis of 2012 theories, such as ''[[Decoding the Past]]'' (2005–2007), ''2012, End of Days'' (2006), ''[[Last Days on Earth]]'' (2006), ''Seven Signs of the Apocalypse'' (2009), and ''Nostradamus 2012'' (2008).&lt;ref name="Armageddon series" /&gt; The [[Discovery Channel]] also aired ''2012 Apocalypse'' in 2009, suggesting that massive [[Geomagnetic storm|solar storms]], [[magnetic pole reversal]], earthquakes, [[supervolcano]]es, and other drastic natural events could occur in 2012.&lt;ref name="2012 Apocalypse" /&gt; In 2012, the [[National Geographic (U.S. TV channel)|National Geographic Channel]] launched a show called ''[[Doomsday Preppers]]'', a documentary series about [[survivalism|survivalists]] preparing for various cataclysms, including the 2012 doomsday.&lt;ref name="nationalgeographic Doomsday Preppers"&gt;{{cite web | title = Doomsday Preppers | work = National Geographic | url = http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/doomsday-preppers/ | accessdate = 6 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hundreds of books were published on the topic.&lt;ref name="foratv" /&gt; The bestselling book of 2009,&lt;ref name="Best-Selling Books of 2009" /&gt; [[Dan Brown]]'s ''[[The Lost Symbol]]'', featured a coded mock email number (2456282.5) that decoded to the [[Julian date]] for 21 December 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Secrets of The Lost Symbol|author1=Dan Bernstein |author2=Arne de Kiuzer |publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson|year=2012|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qgqfqUjF_38C&amp;pg=PT35&amp;lpg=PT35&amp;dq=2456282.5+julian+date+%22lost+symbol%22|accessdate=19 December 2012|isbn=978-0-297-86060-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cinema, the 2009 disaster film ''[[2012 (film)|2012]]'' was inspired by the phenomenon, and advance promotion prior to its release included a [[stealth marketing]] campaign in which TV spots and websites from the fictional "Institute for Human Continuity" called on people to prepare for the end of the world. As these promotions did not mention the film itself, many viewers believed them to be real and contacted astronomers in panic.&lt;ref name="sony" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Relax, the end isn't nigh" /&gt; Although the campaign was heavily criticized,&lt;ref name="foratv" /&gt; the film became one of the most successful of its year, grossing nearly $770&amp;nbsp;million worldwide.&lt;ref name="2009 Worldwide Grosses" /&gt; An article in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' attributed the widespread fear of the 2012 phenomenon in China to the film, which was a smash hit in that country because it depicted the Chinese building "survival arks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=China fears end of the world is nigh|author=Malcolm Moore|work=The Daily Telegraph|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/9729270/China-fears-end-of-the-world-is-nigh.html| accessdate=11 December 2012|location=London|date=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lars von Trier]]'s 2011 film ''[[Melancholia (2011 film)|Melancholia]]'' featured a plot in which a planet emerges from behind the Sun on a collision course with Earth.&lt;ref name="Sunny Kirsten Dunst is picture perfect at the Cannes photocall for her provocative new film Melancholia" /&gt; Announcing his company's purchase of the film, the head of [[Magnolia Pictures]] said in a press release, "As the 2012 apocalypse is upon us, it is time to prepare for a cinematic last supper".&lt;ref name="Magnolia Picks Up North American Rights to Lars von Trier's 'Melancholia'" /&gt;

The phenomenon also inspired several rock and pop music hits. As early as 1997, "[[A Certain Shade of Green]]" by [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]] referred to the mystical belief that a shift in perception would arrive in 2012 ("Are you gonna stand around till 2012 A.D.? / What are you waiting for, a certain shade of green?"). More recent hits include "[[2012 (It Ain't the End)]]" (2010) performed by [[Jay Sean]] and "[[Till the World Ends]]" (2011) performed by [[Britney Spears]]. Towards mid-December 2012, an internet [[hoax]] related to South Korean singer [[Psy]] being one of the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]] was widely circulated around social media platforms. The hoax purported that once Psy's "[[Gangnam Style]]" YouTube video amassed a billion views, the world would end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nst.com.my/opinion/columnist/much-ado-about-apocalypse-1.188870 |newspaper=[[New Straits Times]] |title=Much ado about apocalypse |first=Chok |last=Suat Ling |date=20 December 2012 |accessdate=21 December 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104174754/http://www.nst.com.my/opinion/columnist/much-ado-about-apocalypse-1.188870 |archivedate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indian composer [[A.

A number of brands ran commercials tied to the 2012 apocalypse in the months and days leading to the date. In February 2012, American automotive company [[General Motors]] aired an advertisement during the annual [[Super Bowl]] [[American football|football game]] in which a group of friends drove [[Chevrolet Silverado]]s through the ruins of human civilization following the 2012 apocalypse, while on 17 December 2012, [[Jell-O]] ran an ad saying that offering Jell-O to the Mayan gods would appease them into sparing the world. John Verret, Professor of Advertising at [[Boston University]], questioned the utility of tying large sums of money to such a unique and short-term event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wong |first=Vanessa |title=Brands Capitalize on 'Impending Apocalypse' |publisher=BusinessWeek |url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-12-19/brands-capitalizing-on-the-impending-apocalypse|date=19 December 2012|accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notes ==
{{Refbegin|30em}}
* {{note label|A|a|a}} The [[13 (number)|number 13]] plays an important role in Mesoamerican calendrics; the ''[[tzolk'in]]'', or sacred calendar, was divided into 13 months of 20 days each. The Mayan ''may'' cycle consisted of 13 k'atuns. The reason for the number's importance is uncertain, though correlations to the phases of the moon and to the human gestation period have been suggested.{{sfn|Rice|2007|pp=44, 59}}&lt;ref name="The Origin of the 260-day calendar: the gestation hypothesis reconsidered in light of its use among the Quiche Maya" /&gt;
* {{note label|B|b|b}} The Mayan calendar, unlike the Western calendar, used a zero.&lt;ref name="joyce" /&gt;
* {{note label|C|c|c}} Rather than "0.0.0.0.0", the Mayan Long Count represented the date of creation as "13.0.0.0.0"&lt;ref name=wagner/&gt;
* {{note label|D|d|d}} Most Mayanist scholars, such as [[Mark Van Stone]] and Anthony Aveni, adhere to the "GMT (Goodman-Martinez-Thompson) correlation" with the Long Count, which places the start date at 11 August 3114&amp;nbsp;BC and the end date of b'ak'tun 13 at 21 December 2012.&lt;ref name="Who's Who in the Maya World" /&gt; This date was also the overwhelming preference of those who believed in 2012 eschatology, arguably, Van Stone suggests, because it was a solstice, and was thus astrologically significant. Some Mayanist scholars, such as Michael D. Coe, Linda Schele and [[Marc Zender]], adhere to the "Lounsbury/GMT+2" correlation, which sets the start date at 13 August and the end date at 23 December. Which of these is the precise correlation has yet to be conclusively settled.&lt;ref name="Questions and comments" /&gt;
* {{note label|E|e|e}} Coe's initial date was "24 December 2011". He revised it to "11 January AD 2013" in the 1980 2nd edition of his book,{{sfn|Coe|1980|p=151}} not settling on 23 December 2012 until the 1984 3rd edition.{{refn|{{harvnb|Coe|1984}}. This correlation, which differs two days from Sharer's, is repeated in subsequent editions of Coe's book.}} The correlation of b'ak'tun 13 as 21 December 2012 first appeared in Table B.2 of Robert J. Sharer's 1983 revision of the 4th edition of Sylvanus Morley's book ''The Ancient Maya'' {{harv|Morley|1983|p=603|loc=Table B2}}.

'''Aarhus Symposium''' is an annual leadership conference taking place at the [[Aarhus University|University of Aarhus]], [[Denmark]], on the first Friday in November. The aim of the event is to connect leaders of today with leaders of tomorrow.&lt;ref name="About"/&gt; To do so, a wide range of key decision-makers are invited to share their experiences and engage in discussions with students from various universities. Hereby, the symposium allows students to relate their academic insights to the broader business society.&lt;ref&gt;http://studerende.au.dk/nyheder-og-arrangementer/nyhedsarkiv/nyhed/artikel/danske-topledere-ruster-au-studerende-til-barsk-virkelighed/&lt;/ref&gt;

Aarhus Symposium was founded in 2011 and has since expanded its concept to also involve [[Aarhus Symposium#Aarhus Symposium Focus|Aarhus Symposium Focus]]&lt;ref name="Faglig"&gt;http://www.netvaerksportalen.dk/artikler/studerende-og-topledere-moedes-i-faglig-debat-aarhus-symposium&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Aarhus Symposium#Aarhus Symposium Challenge|Aarhus Symposium Challenge]].&lt;ref name="Challenge"&gt;http://borsen.dk/nyheder/avisen/artikel/11/97854/artikel.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Aarhus Symposium is a non-profit organisation, and all symposia are organised by voluntary students together with a pro-bono board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;http://jyllands-posten.dk/aarhus/erhverv/ECE7183981/Leder-event-udsolgt-p%C3%A5-90-sekunder/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://aarhus-symposium.org/become-a-partner/&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Four students at [[Aarhus University]] established Aarhus Symposium in 2011: David Scherer, Jens Riis Andersen, Kasper Vinther Olesen, and Andreas Emmertsen. They gathered support from other students to organise the very first Aarhus Symposium with the objective of building a bridge between students, i.e. the future leaders, and leaders in today’s businesses and society.&lt;ref&gt;http://borsen.dk/nyheder/avisen/artikel/12/3184822/artikel.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://stiften.dk/aarhus/Erhvervslivets-tunge-drenge-yder-studiehjaelp/artikel/92572&lt;/ref&gt;

The first annual Aarhus Symposium welcomed renowned speakers from the business society such as Carsten Bjerg (then CEO of [[Grundfos]]), Lars Rohde (then CEO of [[Arbejdsmarkedets Tillægspension|ATP]]), and Maria Rønn (CEO of [[DR (broadcaster)|Danmarks Radio]]).&lt;ref name="Growth"&gt;http://aarhus-symposium.org/past-symposia/growth-in-distressed-economies/&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the years, the programme has extended to include prominent speakers such as [[Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark|His Royal Highness The Crown Prince of Denmark]],&lt;ref&gt;http://kongehuset.dk/menu/nyheder/abning-af-aarhus-symposium-2014&lt;/ref&gt; Lars Rebien Sørensen (president and CEO of [[Novo Nordisk]]),&lt;ref&gt;http://jyllands-posten.dk/aarhus/ECE8162162/Studerende-har-hyret-verdens-bedste-chef/&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Denmark|Danish]] [[Prime minister|Prime Minister]] [[Lars Løkke Rasmussen]].&lt;ref&gt;https://jyskebank.tv/nutidens-og-fremtidens-ledere-modes-til-aarhus&lt;/ref&gt;

Aarhus Symposium has grown through the years as a result of wide support from students, speakers, partners, and others.&lt;ref name="Faglig"/&gt; In 2012, the Organising Committee introduced Battle of the Economists; an event to take place on Monday in the week of Aarhus Symposium. It provided a national focus to the overall theme of Aarhus Symposium.&lt;ref&gt;http://borsen.dk/nyheder/avisen/artikel/11/63904/artikel.html&lt;/ref&gt; The event was renamed Aarhus Symposium Focus in 2016 to broaden the possibilities for topics that exceed economic issues.&lt;ref&gt;https://issuu.com/aarhussymposium/docs/booklet2016_final_rgb&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Aarhus Symposium Challenge was established to strengthen the connection between students and the leaders of today.&lt;ref name="Challenge"/&gt; Aarhus Symposium Challenge is an essay competition in which selected speakers put forth a challenge for students to solve. Through their essay, students obtain a seat at both Aarhus Symposium and Aarhus Symposium Focus, and they potentially qualify for [[Aarhus Symposium#Leaders' Forum|Leaders’ Forum]]. Since its initiation in 2013, an increasing number of students have participated in Aarhus Symposium Challenge, making it the primary sign-up for Aarhus Symposium and Aarhus Symposium Focus.&lt;ref&gt;http://aarhus-symposium.org/aarhus-symposium-challenge/&lt;/ref&gt;

Aarhus Symposium takes place on the first Friday in November. Here, business executives and key decision-makers are invited to share their experiences and insights regarding a specific theme. They do so with different perspectives that reflect the tracks, i.e. subtopics, of the event.

[[File:ASForum.jpg|thumb|left|Leaders’ Forum session with Connie Hedegaard at Aarhus Symposium 2015.]]
Leaders’ Forum is an exclusive and intimate session where selected students discuss their essay contribution with the leader that put forth the respective challenge. Only the best essay contributions under each challenge topic qualifies for this informal session.&lt;ref&gt;http://aarhus-symposium.org/challenge-faq/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Chase's Calendar of Events''''' is an annual American publication, started in 1957 by brothers William (Bill) D. Chase (a [[journalist]] and [[publisher]] from [[Michigan]]), and Harrison V. Chase (a university [[social scientist]] from [[Florida]]).&lt;ref name="nyt-2007"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/30/dining/30holi.html | title = Having a Snack? Make It a Holiday | first = Kim | last = Severson| authorlink = Kim Severson | date = May 30, 2007 | work = [[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller-2012"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.annarbor.com/news/chasing-down-days-ann-arbor-founder-of-chases-calendar-of-events-turns-90/ | title = Ann Arbor man, 90, founded catalogue of events for every day of the year | date = April 2, 2012 | first = Janet | last = Miller | work = [[AnnArbor.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes special events, holidays, federal and state observances, historic anniversaries, and more unusual celebratory traditions.&lt;ref name=McGraw/&gt; Bill Chase worked as a newspaper librarian and saw a need for "a single reference source for calendar dates, and for authoritative and current information about various observances throughout the year".&lt;ref name=McGraw&gt;[http://mhprofessional.com/?page=/mhp/categories/chases/content/about_chases.html McGraw Hill] profile&lt;/ref&gt;

The brothers gathered information on events and the first edition of 2,000 copies was printed for 1958. "It was 32 pages, contained 364 entries and sold for $1", while recent editions are 752 pages and contain more than 12,000 entries.&lt;ref name=McGraw/&gt; A promotion sponsored by the US Chamber of Commerce was added in 1958: a pamphlet listed commercial promotions as Special Days, Weeks and Months, and remained in future editions.&lt;ref name=McGraw/&gt; Contemporary Books in Chicago, Illinois, took over publication in 1983 and the Chases retired in 1987 from compiling the calendar, which is now handled by an in-house staff of editors and researchers. Contemporary Books was acquired by [[Tribune Media|Tribune]] in 1993 and sold to [[McGraw-Hill Companies]] in September 2000. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Tribune acquisitions: Tribune Co. said Tuesday it reached...| work = tribunedigital-chicagotribune| accessdate = 2016-08-02| url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1993-07-06/news/9307070173_1_contemporary-books-tribune-distribution-of-interactive-multimedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McGraw/&gt; McGraw-Hill sold the property to [[Rowman and Littlefield|Rowman and Littlefield Publishing Group]] in January 2015, where it is now published by Bernan Press, an imprint of RLPG. &lt;ref&gt;Rowman and Littlefield press release, Jan 28, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36109">This is a chronicle of important events that took place under the [[Shunzhi Emperor]] of the [[Qing Dynasty]] (1636–1912) in what is now [[China]]. It spans from the death of his predecessor [[Hong Taiji]] (r. 1626–1643) in September 1643, to the emperor's own death on 5 February 1661, seven days into the eighteenth year of the Shunzhi [[Chinese era name|reign period]]. These dates do not correspond perfectly with the Shunzhi era itself, which started on 8 February 1644—on [[Chinese New Year|New Year's Day]] of the [[lunisolar calendar|lunisolar year]] following the emperor's accession—and ended on 17 February 1662 (the last day of the 18th year of Shunzhi), more than one [[solar year]] after the emperor's death. The posthumous events related to the Shunzhi Emperor's burial and posthumous cult are also included.

*'''September 21''': [[Hong Taiji]] dies after a successful seventeen-year reign during which the [[Qing]] became a major power in northeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oxnam|1975}} (p. 38), {{harvnb|Wakeman|1985}} (p. 297), and {{harvnb|Gong|2010}} (p. 51) all place Hong Taiji's death on September 21 (Chongde 崇德 8.8.9). {{harvnb|Dennerline|2002}} (p. 74) gives the date as September 9.&lt;/ref&gt; His death threatens to split the Manchus just as they are preparing to attack the Ming.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dennerline|2002|p=74}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''September 26''': a [[Deliberative Council]] of princes and high officials is convened and decides that five-year-old Fulin, [[Hong Taiji]]'s ninth son, will succeed his father, but that Hong Taiji's half-brother [[Dorgon]] and [[Jirgalang]] will be his co-regents. This deal is a compromise between those who wanted to keep the throne in Hung Taiji's descent (the main candidate was Hong Taiji's eldest son [[Hooge (prince)|Hooge]]) and those who supported Dorgon.
*'''October 8''': at the age of six ''sui'', [[Fulin]] officially becomes [[Emperor of China|Emperor]] of the Qing dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fang|1943|p=255}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

When he hears that the capital has fallen, Wu returns to fortify Shanhai Pass.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=290}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Wu's departure from the fortified city of [[Xingcheng|Ningyuan]], where [[Battle of Ningyuan|Ming armies had defeated]] Qing founder [[Nurhaci]] in 1626, leaves all territory outside the Great Wall under Qing control.
*'''April 29''': the victorious Li Zicheng holds an audience with several thousand Ming officials outside the Donghua Gate of the Forbidden City. Assisted by his main [[Grand Secretary]] [[Niu Jinxing]] (牛金星), Li selected 92 officials to serve in the Shun government.

*'''May 5''': Wu Sangui routs an army led by Tang Tong, which Li Zicheng had despatched to attack Shanhai Pass.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 296"&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=296}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''May 10''': Tang Tong's defeated army returns toward Shanhai Pass with reinforcements, but is again defeated by Wu Sangui. Wu takes the city of Yongping (永平) on the road to Beijing.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 296"/&gt;
*'''May 13''': words reach the Qing capital of Shengjing that Li Zicheng has been brutalizing former Ming officials and the population of Beijing. Grand Secretary Fan Wencheng uses these news to argue for a Qing intervention in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=304}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Dorgon agrees to mount a military expedition to punish the rebels and occupy the Central Plains of China.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 305"&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=305}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''May 20''': two of Wu Sangui's lieutenants arrive at Dorgon's camp at the [[Liao River]] carrying a message from their master asking the Manchus to help Wu defeat Li Zicheng's bandits and restore the Ming dynasty in return for "great profits" (大利).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=297}} (date of arrival at the Manchus' camp) and 300–1 (content of the letter).&lt;/ref&gt; Dorgon sends a letter back to Wu Sangui offering.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 305"/&gt; Later that day the Manchus hear for the first time that the Chongzhen emperor was dead.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 305"/&gt; Still on that day, but as a result of earlier plans, small groups of Qing troops start to cross the Great Wall to distribute written proclamations announcing that the Qing army will not harm the population and will only kill Li Zicheng's bandits.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|pages=306–307}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''May 25''': By that date, Li Zicheng's army was already camping in the outskirts of Shanhai Pass, near the Sha River a few kilometers west of the Shanhai Pass garrison; Wu Sangui sends his troops to confront him there.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=309}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Dorgon receives a letter confirming that Wu Sangui has accepted to work for the Qing: he takes his army on a forced march toward Shanhai Pass.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 310"&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=310}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''May 26''': having covered more than 150 kilometers in 24 hours, Dorgon's troops settle eight kilometers away from the Pass to rest for a few hours. They are awoken at midnight to continue marching.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 310"/&gt;

At dawn Dorgon's main army reaches the gates of Shanhaiguan, where Dorgon receives Wu Sangui's formal surrender.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 310"/&gt; The armies deploy for battle: placed in the vanguard, Wu's troops are ordered to charge the Shun army, but they are unable to break the rebels' line and suffer heavy casualties. By the late afternoon, they are on the verge of defeat when a sandstorm starts blowing on the battlefield.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 311"&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=311}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Dorgon chooses this moment to intervene: galloping around Wu's right flank, Qing bannermen destroys Li's left wing.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 311"/&gt; The Shun army is defeated and retreats chaotically toward Yongping; thousands are massacred.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=311–12}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''May 28''': Li Zicheng retreats from Yongping toward Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=312}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Wu Sangui is named Prince Pingxi; his remaining troops shave their heads and join the Qing forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=312}}, note 262.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''May 31''': Li Zicheng reenters Beijing with his troops, which started to loot the capital.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 313"&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=313}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''June 5''': led by Dorgon, Qing troops are welcomed into the capital; the Beijing population is shocked because it was expecting Wu Sangui to bring back the Ming heir apparent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|pages=314–15}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''June 7''': Dorgon issues special proclamations to officials around the capital, assuring them that if the local population accepts to cut their hair and to surrender, the officials will be allowed to stay at their post.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=416}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (See June 25.)

==Outline== 
For the purposes of this summary, it is convenient to divide the chronology of the universe since it [[Cosmogony|originated]], into five parts. It is generally considered meaningless or unclear whether [[time]] existed before this chronology:&lt;!--merely based on the de facto article toc, not binding in any way and can be rearranged along with article structure--&gt;

:'''1. The [[#Very early universe|very early universe]]''' – the first [[picosecond]]&amp;nbsp;(10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt;) of cosmic time. It includes the [[Planck epoch]], during which currently understood [[laws of physics]] may not apply; the emergence in stages of the four known [[fundamental interaction]]s or [[force]]s – first [[gravity]], and later the [[strong interaction|strong]], [[weak interaction|weak]] and [[electromagnetic interaction|electromagnetic]] interactions; and the [[metric expansion of space|expansion of space]] and [[supercooling]] of the  still immensely hot universe due to [[cosmic inflation]], which is believed to have been triggered by the separation of the [[Strong interaction|strong]] and [[electroweak interaction]].

:Tiny ripples in the universe at this stage are believed to be the basis of large-scale structures that formed much later. Different stages of the very early universe are understood to different extents.  The earlier parts are beyond the grasp of practical experiments in [[particle physics]] but can be explored through other means.

:'''2. The [[#Early universe|early universe]]''', lasting around 377,000 years. Initially, various kinds of [[subatomic particle]]s are formed in stages. These particles include almost equal amounts of [[matter]] and [[antimatter]], so most of it quickly annihilates, leaving a small excess of matter in the universe.

:At about one second,  [[Neutrino decoupling|neutrinos decouple]]; these neutrinos form the [[cosmic neutrino background]]. If [[primordial black hole]]s exist, they are also  formed at about one second of cosmic time.  [[Composite particle|Composite]] [[subatomic particle]]s emerge – including [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s – and from about 3 minutes, conditions are suitable for [[nucleosynthesis]]: around 25% of the protons and all the neutrons  [[nuclear fusion|fuse]] [[big bang nucleosynthesis|into heavier elements]], mainly [[helium-4]].

:By 20 minutes, the universe is no longer hot enough for fusion, but far too hot for neutral [[atom]]s to exist or [[photon]]s to travel far. It is therefore an [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. At around 47,000 years,&lt;ref name="ryden"&gt;Ryden, Barbara, "Introduction to Cosmology", 2006, eqn. 6.33, 6.41&lt;/ref&gt; as the universe cools, its behavior begins to be dominated by [[matter]] rather than radiation.

:At about 377,000 years {{citation needed|date=November 2018}}, the universe finally becomes cool enough for neutral [[atom]]s to form ("[[Recombination (cosmology)|recombination]]"), and as a result it also became [[Transparency and translucency|transparent]] for the first time. The newly formed atoms – mainly [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] with traces of [[lithium]] – quickly reach their lowest energy state ([[ground state]]) by releasing photons ("[[decoupling (cosmology)|photon decoupling]]"), and these photons can still be detected today as the [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB). This is currently the oldest observation we have of the universe.

:'''3. Dark Ages and large-scale [[structure formation|structure emergence]]''', from 377,000 years until about 1 billion years. After [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] and [[decoupling (cosmology)|decoupling]], the universe was transparent but the clouds of [[hydrogen]] only collapsed very slowly to form [[star]]s and [[galaxy|galaxies]], so there were no new sources of light. The only photons (electromagnetic radiation, or "light") in the universe were those released during decoupling (visible today as the [[cosmic microwave background]]) and [[hydrogen line|21 cm radio emissions]] occasionally emitted by hydrogen atoms. The decoupled photons would have filled the universe with a brilliant pale orange glow at first, gradually [[redshift]]ing to non-visible [[wavelength]]s after about 3 million years, leaving it without visible light. This period is known as the [[Dark Ages (cosmology)|Dark Ages]].

:Between about 10 and 17 million years the universe's average temperature was suitable for liquid water (273 – 373K) and there has been speculation whether rocky planets or indeed life could have arisen briefly, since statistically a tiny part of the universe could have had different conditions from the rest, and gained warmth from the universe as a whole.&lt;ref name="IJA-2014October" /&gt;

:At some point around 400 to 700 million years, the earliest generations of [[stellar evolution|stars]] and [[galaxy formation and evolution|galaxies form]], and early large structures gradually emerge, drawn to the foam-like  [[dark matter]] [[filament (cosmology)|filaments]] which have already begun to draw together throughout the universe. [[Population III star|The earliest generations of stars]] have not yet been observed astronomically. They may have been huge and [[metallicity|non-metallic]] with very short lifetimes compared to [[Main Sequence|most stars we see today]], so they commonly finish burning their [[hydrogen]] fuel and explode as [[supernova]]e after mere millions of years. Other theories suggest that they may have included small stars, some perhaps still burning today. In either case, these early generations of supernovae created most of the everyday [[chemical element|elements]] we see around us today, and seeded the universe with them.

:[[Galaxy cluster]]s and [[supercluster]]s emerge over time. At some point, high energy photons from the earliest stars, [[dwarf galaxy|dwarf galaxies]] and perhaps [[quasar]]s led to a period of [[reionization]]. The universe gradually transitioned into the universe we see around us today, and the Dark Ages only fully came to an end at about 1 billion years.

:'''4. The universe as it appears today'''. From 1 billion years, and for about 12.8 billions of years, the universe has looked much as it does today. It will continue to appear very similar for many billions of years into the future. The [[thin disk]] of [[Milky Way|our galaxy]] began to form at about 5 billion years (8.8 bn years ago),&lt;ref name=Peloso&gt;{{cite journal |last1=del Peloso |first1=E. F. |last2=da Silva |first2=L. |last3=Porto de Mello |first3=G. F. |last4=Arany-Prado |first4=L. I. |title=The age of the Galactic thin disk from Th/Eunucleocosmochronology. III.

:From about 9.8 billion years of cosmic time,&lt;ref name="ryden" /&gt; the slowing expansion of space gradually begins to accelerate under the influence of [[dark energy]], which may be a [[scalar field]] throughout our universe. The present-day universe is understood quite well, but beyond about 100 billion years of cosmic time (about 86 billion years in the future), uncertainties in current knowledge mean that we are less sure which path our universe will take.

:'''5. [[Fate of the universe|The far future]]'''. At some time the [[Stelliferous Era]] will end as stars are no longer being born, and the expansion of the universe will mean that the observable universe becomes limited to local galaxies. There are various scenarios for the far future and [[ultimate fate of the universe]]. More exact knowledge of our current universe will allow these to be better understood.

Earliest stages of chronology shown below (before neutrino decoupling) are an active area of research and based on ideas which are still speculative and subject to modification as scientific knowledge improves.

"Time" column is based on extrapolation of observed [[metric expansion of space]] back in the past. For the earliest stages of chronology this extrapolation may be invalid. To give one example, [[eternal inflation]] theories propose that inflation lasts forever throughout most of the universe, making the notion of "N seconds since Big Bang" ill-defined.

The radiation temperature refers to the [[cosmic background radiation]] and is given by 2.725·(1+''z''), where ''z'' is the [[redshift]].

==Very early universe {{anchor|Very early universe}}==

===Planck epoch===
:''Times shorter than 10&lt;sup&gt;−43&lt;/sup&gt; seconds ([[Planck time]])''
{{Main|Planck epoch}}

The [[Timeline of the formation of the Universe#Planck Epoch|Planck epoch]] is an era in traditional (non-inflationary) [[Big Bang|Big Bang cosmology]] immediately after the event which began our known universe. During this epoch, the temperature and average energies within the universe were so inconceivably high compared to any temperature we can observe today, that everyday subatomic particles could not form, and even the four fundamental forces that shape our universe—[[electromagnetism]], [[gravitation]], [[weak interaction|weak nuclear interaction]], and [[strong interaction|strong nuclear interaction]]—were combined and formed one fundamental force. Little is understood about physics at this temperature; different hypotheses propose different scenarios. Traditional big bang cosmology predicts a [[gravitational singularity]] before this time, but this theory relies on the theory of [[general relativity]], which is thought to break down for this epoch due to [[quantum mechanics|quantum effects]].

In inflationary models of cosmology, times before the end of inflation (roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; second after the Big Bang) do not follow the same timeline as in traditional big bang cosmology. Models that aim to describe the universe and physics during the Planck epoch are generally speculative and fall under the umbrella of "[[New Physics]]". Examples include the [[Hartle–Hawking initial state]], [[string landscape]],  [[string gas cosmology]], and the [[ekpyrotic universe]].

===Grand unification epoch===
:''Between 10&lt;sup&gt;−43&lt;/sup&gt; seconds and 10&lt;sup&gt;−36&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang''&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Ryden B: "Introduction to Cosmology", p. 196 Addison-Wesley 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Main|Grand unification epoch}}

As the universe [[metric expansion of space|expanded]] and cooled, it crossed transition temperatures at which forces separated from each other. These [[phase transition]]s can be visualised as similar to [[condensation]] and [[freezing]] phase transitions of ordinary matter. At certain temperatures/energies, water molecules change their behaviour and structure, and they will behave completely differently. Like steam turning to water, the [[field (physics)|fields]] which define our universe's fundamental forces and particles also completely change their behaviors and structures when the temperature/energy falls below a certain point. This is not apparent in everyday life, because it only happens at much, much, higher temperatures than we usually see in our present universe.

These phase transitions are believed to be caused by a phenomenon of [[quantum field]]s called "[[symmetry breaking]]".

In everyday terms, as the universe cools, it becomes possible for the quantum fields that create the forces and particles around us, to settle at lower energy levels and with higher levels of stability. In doing so, they completely shift how they interact. Forces and interactions arise due to these fields, so the universe can behave very differently above and below a phase transition. For example, in a later epoch, a side effect of one phase transition is that suddenly, many particles that had no mass at all acquire a mass (they begin to interact with the [[Higgs boson]]), and a single  force begins to manifest as two separate forces.

The grand unification epoch began with a phase transitions of this kind, when gravitation separated from the universal combined [[gauge theory|gauge force]]. This caused two forces to now exist: gravity, and an  [[electrostrong interaction]]. There is no hard evidence yet, that such a combined force existed, but many physicists believe it did. The physics of this electrostrong interaction would be described by a so-called [[grand unified theory]] (GUT).

The grand unification epoch ended with a second phase transition, as the electrostrong interaction in turn separated, and began to manifest as two separate interactions, called the [[strong force|strong]] and [[electroweak force|electroweak]] interactions.

===Electroweak epoch===
:''Between 10&lt;sup&gt;−36&lt;/sup&gt; seconds (or the end of inflation) and 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang''&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;
{{Main|Electroweak epoch}}

Depending on how epochs are defined, and the model being followed, the [[electroweak epoch]] may be considered to start before or after the inflationary epoch. In some models it is described as including the inflationary epoch. In other models, the electroweak epoch is said to begin after the inflationary epoch ended, at roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; seconds.

According to traditional big bang cosmology, the electroweak epoch began 10&lt;sup&gt;−36&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang, when the temperature of the universe was low enough (10&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; K) for the [[Grand Unified Theory|Electronuclear Force]] to begin to manifest as two separate interactions, called the [[strong interaction|strong]] and the [[electroweak interaction|electroweak]] interactions. (The electroweak interaction will also separate later, dividing into the [[electromagnetic interaction|electromagnetic]] and [[weak interaction|weak]] interactions). The exact point where electrostrong symmetry was broken is not certain, because of the very high energies of this event.

===Inflationary epoch and the rapid expansion of space===
:''Before ca.  10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang''
{{Main|Inflationary epoch|Expansion of space}}
At this point, the very early universe [[expansion of space|suddenly and very rapidly expanded]] to at least 10&lt;sup&gt;78&lt;/sup&gt; times its previous volume (and possibly much more). This is equivalent to a linear increase of at least 10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; times in every spatial dimension – equivalent to an object 1 [[nanometer]] (10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; [[Meter|m]], about half the width of a [[molecule]] of [[DNA]]) in length, expanding to one approximately 10.6 [[light years]] (about 62 trillion miles) long in a tiny fraction of a second. This change is known as [[inflation (cosmology)|inflation]].

Although light and objects within [[spacetime]] cannot travel faster than the [[speed of light]], in this case it was the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric]] governing the size and geometry of [[spacetime]] itself that changed in scale. Changes to the metric are not limited by the speed of light.

In some models, it is thought to have been triggered by the [[phase transition|separation]] of the [[strong interaction|strong]] and [[electroweak interaction]]s which ended the [[grand unification epoch]]. One of the theoretical products of this phase transition was a [[scalar field]] called the [[inflaton]] field. As this field settled into its lowest energy state throughout the universe, it generated an enormous repulsive force that led to a rapid expansion of space itself. Inflation explains several observed properties of the current universe that are otherwise difficult to account for, including explaining how today's universe has ended up so exceedingly [[homogeneous]] (similar) on a very large scale, even though it was highly disordered in its earliest stages.

It is not known exactly when the inflationary epoch ended, but it is thought to have been between 10&lt;sup&gt;−33&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang.  The rapid expansion of space meant that elementary particles remaining from the grand unification epoch were now distributed very thinly across the universe. However, the huge potential energy of the inflation field was released at the end of the inflationary epoch, as the inflaton field decayed into other particles, known as "reheating". This heating effect led to the universe being repopulated with a dense, hot mixture of [[quark–gluon plasma|quarks, anti-quarks and gluons]]. In other models, reheating is often considered to mark the start of the [[electroweak epoch]], and some  theories, such as [[warm inflation]], avoid a reheating phase entirely.

In non-traditional versions of Big Bang theory  (known as "inflationary" models), inflation ended at a temperature corresponding to roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; second after the Big Bang, but this does ''not'' imply that the inflationary era lasted less than 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; second. To explain the observed homogeneity of the universe, the duration in these models must be longer than 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; second. Therefore, in inflationary cosmology, the earliest meaningful time "after the Big Bang" is the time of the ''end'' of inflation. 

After inflation ended, the universe continued to expand, but at a very slow rate. The slow expansion began to speed up after several billion years, believed to be due to [[dark energy]], and is still expanding today.

On March 17, 2014, astrophysicists of the [[BICEP and Keck Array|BICEP2]] collaboration announced the detection of inflationary [[gravitational waves]] in the [[B-modes|B-mode]] [[power spectrum]] which was interpreted as clear experimental evidence for the [[Inflation (cosmology)|theory of inflation]].&lt;ref name="BICEP2-2014"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=BICEP2 2014 Results Release |url=http://bicepkeck.org |date=17 March 2014 |website=[[National Science Foundation]] |accessdate=18 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-20140317"&gt;{{cite web |last=Clavin |first=Whitney |title=NASA Technology Views Birth of the Universe |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2014-082 |date=17 March 2014 |website=[[NASA]] |accessdate=17 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20140317B"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=Space Ripples Reveal Big Bang’s Smoking Gun |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html |date=March 17, 2014 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=March 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20140324"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=Ripples From the Big Bang |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/25/science/space/ripples-from-the-big-bang.html |date=March 24, 2014 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=March 24, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PRL-20140619"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=6865|work=BICEP2 News|title=Not Even Wrong|date=13 May 2014|first=Peter|last=Woit|accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on June 19, 2014, lowered confidence in confirming the [[cosmic inflation]] findings was reported &lt;ref name="PRL-20140619"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ade, P.

===Electroweak symmetry breaking ===
:''10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang''
{{Main|Electroweak symmetry breaking}}

As the universe's temperature continued to fall below a certain very high energy level, a third [[symmetry breaking]] occurs. So far as we currently know, it was the final symmetry breaking event in the formation of our universe. It is believed that below some energies unknown yet&lt;!-- IF THIS IS CHANGED, PLEASE ALSO UPDATE THE SAME INFO AT [[Electroweak interaction ]], [[Electroweak scale]], [[Electroweak epoch]]. THANK YOU. --&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;The particular number 246 GeV is taken to be the [[vacuum expectation value]] &lt;math&gt;v = (G_F \sqrt{2})^{-1/2}&lt;/math&gt; of the [[Higgs field]] (where &lt;math&gt;G_F&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Fermi coupling constant]]), it's not the symmetry breaking energy scale.&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source|date=March 2018}} the [[Higgs field]] spontaneously acquires a [[vacuum expectation value]]. When this happens, it [[electroweak symmetry breaking|breaks electroweak gauge symmetry]]. This has two related effects:

# Via the [[Higgs mechanism]], all [[elementary particle]]s interacting with the Higgs field become massive, having been massless at higher energy levels.
# As a side-effect, the [[weak force]] and [[electromagnetic force]], and their respective [[boson]]s (the [[W and Z bosons]] and [[photon]]) now begin to manifest differently in the present universe. Before electroweak symmetry breaking these bosons were all massless particles and interacted over long distances, but at this point the W and Z bosons abruptly become massive particles only interacting over distances smaller than the size of an atom, while the photon remains massless and remains a long-distance interaction.

After electroweak symmetry breaking, the [[fundamental interactions]] we know of – [[gravitation]], [[electromagnetism]], the [[strong interaction]] and the [[weak interaction]] – have all taken their present forms, and fundamental particles have mass, but the temperature of the universe is still too high to allow the formation of many fundamental particles we now see in the universe.

===Supersymmetry breaking (speculative)===
{{Main|Supersymmetry breaking}}

If [[supersymmetry]] is a property of our universe, then it must be broken at an energy that is no lower than 1 [[TeV]], the electroweak scale. The masses of particles and their [[superpartner]]s would then no longer be equal.  This very high energy could explain why no superpartners of known particles have ever been observed.

==Early universe{{anchor|Early universe}}==

After cosmic inflation ends, the universe is filled with a hot [[quark–gluon plasma]], the remains of reheating. From this point onwards the physics of the early universe is much better understood, and the energies involved in the [[Quark epoch]] are directly amenable to [[particle physics|experiment]].

===The quark epoch===
:''Between 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; seconds and 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang''
{{Main|Quark epoch}}

The [[quark epoch]] began approximately [[Picosecond|10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; seconds]] after the [[Big Bang]]. This was the period in the evolution of the early universe immediately after [[electroweak symmetry breaking]], when the [[fundamental interaction]]s of [[gravitation]], [[electromagnetism]], the [[strong interaction]] and the [[weak interaction]] had taken their present forms, but the temperature of the universe was still too high to allow [[quark]]s to bind together to form [[hadron]]s.

During the quark epoch the universe was filled with a dense, hot [[quark–gluon plasma]], containing quarks, [[lepton]]s and their [[antiparticle]]s. Collisions between particles were too energetic to allow quarks to combine into [[meson]]s or [[baryon]]s.

The quark epoch ended when the universe was about 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; seconds old, when the average energy of particle interactions had fallen below the [[binding energy]] of hadrons.

====Baryogenesis====
{{Main|Baryogenesis}}
{{further|Leptogenesis (physics)}}
''Perhaps by 10&lt;sup&gt;−11&lt;/sup&gt; seconds.''{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

[[Baryon]]s are [[subatomic particle]]s such as [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s, that are composed of three [[quark]]s. It would be expected that both baryons, and particles known as [[antimatter|antibaryons]] would have formed in equal numbers. However, this does not seem to be what happened – as far as we know, the universe was left with far more baryons than antibaryons. In fact, almost no antibaryons are observed in nature. It is not clear how this came about. Any explanation for this phenomenon must allow the [[Sakharov conditions]] related to baryogenesis to have been satisfied at some time after the end of [[cosmological inflation]]. Current [[particle physics]] suggests asymmetries under which these conditions would be met, but these asymmetries appear to be too small to account for the observed baryon-antibaryon asymmetry of the universe.

===Hadron epoch===
:''Between 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; second and 1 second after the Big Bang''
{{Main|Hadron epoch}}

The quark–gluon plasma that composes the universe cools until [[hadron]]s, including baryons such as [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s, can form.
Initially, hadron/anti-hadron pairs could form, so [[matter]] and [[anti-matter]] were in [[thermal equilibrium]]. However, as the temperature of the universe continued to fall, new hadron/anti-hadron pairs were no longer produced, and most of the newly formed hadrons and anti-hadrons [[annihilation|annihilated]] each other, giving rise to pairs of high-energy [[photon]]s. A comparatively small residue of hadrons remained at about 1 second of cosmic time, when this epoch ended. 

Theory predicts that about 1 neutron remained for every 7 protons. We believe this to be correct because, at a later stage, all the neutrons and some of the protons [[nuclear fusion|fused]], leaving [[hydrogen]], a hydrogen [[isotope]] called [[deuterium]], [[helium]] and other elements, which we can measure. A 1:7 ratio of hadrons at the end of this epoch would indeed produce the observed element ratios in the early as well as current universe.&lt;ref name="karki_2011" /&gt;

===Neutrino decoupling and cosmic neutrino background===
:''Around 1 second after the Big Bang''
{{main|Neutrino decoupling|Cosmic neutrino background}}

At approximately 1 second after the Big Bang [[neutrino]]s [[neutrino decoupling|decouple]] and begin traveling freely through space. As neutrinos rarely interact with matter, these neutrinos still exist today, analogous to the much later [[cosmic microwave background]] emitted during [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]], around 377,000 years after the Big Bang. The neutrinos from this event have a very low energy, around 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; times smaller than is possible with present-day direct detection.&lt;ref name="forbes_neutrino"&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2016/09/09/cosmic-neutrinos-detected-confirming-the-big-bangs-last-great-prediction Cosmic Neutrinos Detected, Confirming The Big Bang's Last Great Prediction] – ''[[Forbes]]'' coverage of original paper: {{cite journal |last1=Follin |first1=Brent |last2=Knox |first2=Lloyd |last3=Millea |first3=Marius |last4=Pan |first4=Zhen |title=First Detection of the Acoustic Oscillation Phase Shift Expected from the Cosmic Neutrino Background |journal=Physical Review Letters |date=26 August 2015 |volume=115 |issue=9 |pages=091301 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.091301|pmid=26371637 |arxiv=1503.07863 |bibcode=2015PhRvL.115i1301F }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even high energy neutrinos are [[neutrino detector|notoriously difficult to detect]], so this [[cosmic neutrino background]] (CNB) may not be directly observed in detail for many years, if at all.&lt;ref name="forbes_neutrino"/&gt;

However, Big Bang cosmology makes many predictions about the CNB, and there is very strong indirect evidence that the cosmic neutrino background exists, both from [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]] predictions of the helium abundance, and from anisotropies in the [[cosmic microwave background]]. One of these predictions is that neutrinos will have left a subtle imprint on the cosmic microwave background (CMB). It is well known that the CMB has irregularities. Some of the CMB fluctuations were roughly regularly spaced, because of the effect of [[baryon acoustic oscillations|baryonic acoustic oscillations]]. In theory, the decoupled neutrinos should have had a very slight effect on the [[Phase (waves)|phase]] of the various CMB fluctuations.&lt;ref name="forbes_neutrino"/&gt;

In 2015, it was reported that such shifts had been detected in the CMB. Moreover, the fluctuations corresponded to neutrinos of almost exactly the temperature predicted by Big Bang theory ({{nowrap|1.96 +/-0.02K}} compared to a prediction of 1.95K), and exactly three types of neutrino, the same number of neutrino flavours currently predicted by the [[Standard Model]].&lt;ref name="forbes_neutrino"/&gt;

=== Possible formation of primordial black holes===
: ''May have occurred within about 1 second after the Big Bang''
[[Primordial black hole]]s are a hypothetical type of [[black hole]] proposed in 1966,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zel'dovitch &amp; Novikov|title=The Hypothesis of Cores Retarded During Expansion and the Hot Cosmological Model|journal=Astronomicheskii Zhurnal|date=14 March 1966|volume=10|issue=4|pages=602–603|bibcode=1966AZh....43..758Z}}&lt;/ref&gt; that may have formed during the so-called ''radiation dominated era'', due to the high densities and inhomogeneous conditions within the first second of cosmic time. Random fluctuations could lead to some regions becoming dense enough to undergo gravitational collapse, forming black holes. Current understandings and theories place tight limits on the abundance and mass of these objects.

Typically, primordial black hole formation requires density contrasts (regional variations in the Universe's density) of around &lt;math&gt; \delta \rho / \rho \sim 0.1 &lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;(10%), where &lt;math&gt; \rho &lt;/math&gt; is the average density of the Universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Harada |first=T. |last2=Yoo |first2=C.-M. |last3=Khori |first3=K. |year=2013 |title=Threshold of primordial black hole formation |journal=[[Physical Review D]] |volume=88 |issue=8 |pages=084051 |arxiv=1309.4201 |bibcode= 2013PhRvD..88h4051H|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.88.084051 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several mechanisms could produce dense regions meeting this criterion during the early universe, including reheating, cosmological phase transitions and (in so-called "hybrid inflation models") axion inflation. Since primordial black holes didn't form from stellar [[gravitational collapse]], their masses can be far below stellar mass (~2×10&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;g). [[Stephen Hawking]] calculated in 1971 that primordial black holes could weigh as little as 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;g.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} But they can have any size, so they could also be large, and may have contributed to the [[Galaxy formation and evolution|formation of galaxies]].

===Lepton epoch===
:''Between 1 second and 10 seconds after the Big Bang''
{{Main|Lepton epoch}}

The majority of hadrons and anti-hadrons annihilate each other at the end of the hadron epoch, leaving [[lepton]]s (such as the [[electron]], [[muon]]s and certain [[neutrino]]s) and anti-leptons, dominating the mass of the universe. 

The lepton epoch follows a similar path to the earlier hadron epoch. Initially leptons and anti-leptons are produced in pairs. About 10 seconds after the Big Bang the temperature of the universe falls to the point at which new lepton/anti-lepton pairs are no longer created and most remaining leptons and anti-leptons quickly [[annihilation|annihilate]] each other, giving rise to pairs of high energy photons, and leaving a small residue of non-annihilated leptons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knowledgetreeproject.org/beginningweb.htm|title=The Timescale of Creation|website=Knowledge tree project|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090728123714/http://www.knowledgetreeproject.org/beginningweb.htm|archivedate=28 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Photon epoch===
:''Between 10 seconds and 377,000 years after the Big Bang''
{{Main|Photon epoch}}

After most leptons and anti-leptons are annihilated at the end of the lepton epoch, most of the mass-energy in the universe is left in the form of [[photon]]s. (Much of the rest of its mass-energy is in the form of [[neutrino]]s and other [[special relativity|relativistic]] particles{{cn|date=September 2018}}). Therefore the energy of the universe, and its overall behavior, is dominated by its [[photon]]s. These photons continue to interact frequently with charged protons, electrons and (eventually) [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]]. They continue to do so for about the next 377,000 years.

===Nucleosynthesis of light elements===
:''Between 2 minutes and 20 minutes after the Big Bang''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/BBNS.html|title=Detailed timeline of Big Bang nucleosynthesis processes|first=Edward L.|last=Wright|date=26 September 2012|website=astro.ucla.edu|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Main|Big Bang nucleosynthesis}}

Between about 2 and 20 minutes after the Big Bang, the temperature and pressure of the universe allow [[nuclear fusion]] to occur, giving rise to nuclei of a few light [[chemical element|elements]] beyond hydrogen ("[[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]]"). About 25% of the protons, and all&lt;ref name="karki_2011" /&gt; the neutrons fuse to form [[deuterium]], a hydrogen [[isotope]], and most of the deuterium quickly fuses to form [[helium-4]]. 

Atomic nuclei will easily unbind (break apart) above a certain temperature, related to their [[binding energy]]. From about 2 minutes, the falling temperature means that deuterium no longer unbinds, and is stable,  and starting from about 3 minutes, helium and other elements formed by the fusion of deuterium  also no longer unbind and are stable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~ryden/ast162_10/notes44.html|first=Barbara|last=Ryden|date=12 March 2003|title=Astronomy 162 — Lecture 44: The first three minutes|website=astronomy.ohio-state.edu|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The short duration and falling temperature means that only the simplest and fastest fusion processes can occur. Only tiny amounts of nuclei beyond helium are formed, because [[nucleosynthesis]] of heavier elements is difficult and [[triple-alpha process|requires thousands of years]] even in stars.&lt;ref name="karki_2011"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/HP/article/download/5186/4314|title=The foreground of big bang nucleosynthesis|first=Ravi|last=Karki|journal=The Himalayan Phisics|volume=1|issue=1|date=May 2010|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small amounts of [[tritium]] (another hydrogen isotope) and [[beryllium]]-7 and -8 are formed, but these are unstable and are quickly lost again.&lt;ref name="karki_2011" /&gt; A small amount of deuterium is left unfused because of the very short duration.&lt;ref name="karki_2011"/&gt;

Therefore, the only stable nuclides created by the end of [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]] are protium (single proton/hydrogen nucleus), deuterium, helium-3, helium-4, and lithium-7.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |arxiv = 1403.4156 |title = Revised Big Bang Nucleosynthesis with long-lived negatively charged massive particles: Impact of new 6Li limits, primordial 9Be nucleosynthesis, and updated recombination rates |journal = The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series |volume = 214 |issue = 1 |pages = 5 |last1=Kusakabe |first1=Motohiko |display-authors=etal |year = 2014|doi = 10.1088/0067-0049/214/1/5 |bibcode = 2014ApJS..214....5K }}&lt;/ref&gt; By mass, the resulting matter is about 75% hydrogen nuclei, 25% helium nuclei, and perhaps 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; by mass of [[Lithium-7]]. The next most common stable isotopes produced are [[lithium-6]], [[beryllium-9]], [[boron-11]], [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]] and [[oxygen]] ("CNO"), but these have predicted abundances of between 5 and 30 parts in 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; by mass, making them essentially undetectable and negligible.&lt;ref name=iop&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1088/1742-6596/665/1/012001|title = Primordial Nucleosynthesis|journal = Journal of Physics: Conference Series|volume = 665|issue = 10102|pages = 012001|year = 2017|last1 = Coc|first1 = A|arxiv = 1609.06048}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |arxiv = 1403.6694 |title = Standard big bang nucleosynthesis and primordial CNO Abundances after Planck|journal = Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics |volume = 2014|issue = 10|pages = 050|doi = 10.1088/1475-7516/2014/10/050|year = 2014|last1 = Coc|first1 = Alain|last2 = Uzan|first2 = Jean-Philippe|last3 = Vangioni|first3 = Elisabeth|bibcode = 2014JCAP...10..050C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amounts of each light element in the early universe can be estimated from old galaxies, and is strong evidence for the Big Bang.&lt;ref name="karki_2011" /&gt; For example, the Big Bang should produce about 1 neutron for every 7 protons, allowing for 25% of all nucleons to be fused into helium-4 (2 protons and 2 neutrons out of every 16 nucleons), and this is the amount we find today, and far more than can be easily explained by other processes.&lt;ref name="karki_2011" /&gt; Similarly, deuterium fuses extremely easily; any alternative explanation must also explain how conditions existed for deuterium to form, but also left some of that deuterium unfused and not immediately fused again into helium.&lt;ref name="karki_2011" /&gt; Any alternative must also explain the proportions of the various light elements and their isotopes. A few isotopes, such as lithium-7, were found to be present in amounts that differed from theory, but over time, these differences have been resolved by better observations.&lt;ref name="karki_2011" /&gt;

===Matter domination===
:''47,000 years after the Big Bang''
{{main|Matter-dominated era}}
Until now, the universe's large scale dynamics and behavior have been determined mainly by radiation – meaning, those constituents that move [[special relativity|relativistically]] (at or near the [[speed of light]]), such as [[photon]]s and [[neutrino]]s.&lt;ref name="ryden" /&gt; As the universe cools, from around 47,000 years (z=3600),&lt;ref name="ryden" /&gt; the universe's large scale behavior becomes dominated by [[matter]] instead. This occurs because the energy density of matter begins to exceed both the energy density of radiation  and the vacuum energy density.&lt;ref&gt;Zelik, M and Gregory, S: "Introductory Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics", page 497. Thompson Learning, Inc. 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Around or shortly after this time,{{when|date=April 2018}} the densities of non-relativistic matter (atomic nuclei) and relativistic radiation (photons) become equal, the [[Jeans length]], which determines the smallest structures that can form (due to competition between gravitational attraction and pressure effects), begins to fall and perturbations, instead of being wiped out by [[free-streaming]] [[radiation]], can begin to grow in amplitude.

According to the [[Lambda-CDM model]], by this stage, the [[matter]] in the universe is around 84.5% [[cold dark matter]] and 15.5% "ordinary" matter. (However the total matter in the universe is only 31.7%, much smaller than the 68.3% of [[dark energy]]). There is overwhelming evidence that [[dark matter]] exists and dominates our universe, but since the exact nature of dark matter is still not understood, Big Bang theory does not presently cover any stages in its formation.

From this point on, and for several billion years to come, the presence of dark matter accelerates the [[structure formation|formation of structure]] in our universe. In the early universe, dark matter gradually gathers in huge filaments under the effects of [[gravity]]. This amplifies the tiny inhomogeneities (irregularities) in the density of the universe which was left by cosmic inflation. Over time, slightly denser regions become denser and slightly rarefied (emptier) regions become more rarefied. Ordinary matter eventually gathers together faster than it would otherwise do, because of the presence of these concentrations of dark matter.

About 377,000 years after the Big Bang, two connected events occurred: [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] and [[decoupling (cosmology)|photon decoupling]]. Recombination describes the ionized particles combining to form the first  neutral [[atom]]s, and decoupling refers to the [[photon]]s released ("decoupled") as the newly formed atoms settle into more stable energy states.

Just before recombination, the [[baryonic matter]] in the universe was at a temperature where it formed a hot [[plasma (physics)|ionized plasma]]. Most of the photons in the universe interacted with electrons and protons, and could not travel significant distances without interacting with ionized particles. As a result, the universe was opaque or "foggy". Although there was light, it was not possible to see, nor can we observe that light through telescopes.

At around 377,000 years, the universe has cooled to a point where free [[electron]]s can combine with the [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] to form neutral atoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Five-Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) Observations: Data Processing, Sky Maps, and Basic Results | first=G. | last=Hinshaw | journal=Astrophysical Journal Supplement | volume=180 | issue=2| pages=225–245 | year=2009 | url=http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/map/dr3/pub_papers/fiveyear/basic_results/wmap5basic.pdf |format=PDF| doi=10.1088/0067-0049/180/2/225 | arxiv=0803.0732 | bibcode=2009ApJS..180..225H|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is relatively fast (and faster for the helium than for the hydrogen), and is known as [[Recombination (cosmology)|recombination]].&lt;ref&gt;Mukhanov, V: "Physical foundations of Cosmology", p. 120, Cambridge 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The name is slightly inaccurate and is given for historical reasons: in fact the electrons and atomic nuclei were combining for the first time.

Directly combining in a low energy state ([[ground state]]) is less efficient, so these hydrogen atoms generally form with the electrons still in a high energy state, and once combined, the electrons quickly release energy in the form of one or more [[photon]]s as they transition to a low energy state. This release of photons is known as [[Decoupling (cosmology)|photon decoupling]]. Some of these decoupled photons are captured by other hydrogen atoms, the remainder remain free. By the end of recombination, most of the protons in the universe have formed neutral atoms. This change from charged to neutral particles means that the [[mean free path]] photons can travel before capture in effect becomes infinite, so any decoupled photons that have not been captured can travel freely over long distances (see [[Thomson scattering]]). The universe has become transparent to visible [[light]], [[radio wave]]s and other [[electromagnetic radiation]] for the first time in its history.

{| class="wikitable" align="right" width="15%" style="background-color:#fffdee;font-size:80%"
| The background of this box approximates the original [[Color temperature|4000K color]] of the photons released during decoupling, before they became [[redshift]]ed to form the [[cosmic microwave background]]. The universe would have appeared as a brilliantly glowing fog of a color similar to this, at the time.
|}
The photons released by these newly formed hydrogen atoms initially had a [[Color temperature|temperature/energy of around ~ 4000&amp;nbsp;K]]. This would have been visible to the eye as a pale yellow/orange tinted, or "soft", white color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mediacollege.com/lighting/colour/colour-temperature.html|title=Color temperature chart|website=Media college|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over billions of years since decoupling, as the universe has expanded, the photons have been [[red-shift]]ed from visible light to radio waves (microwave radiation corresponding to a temperature of about 2.7&amp;nbsp;K). Red shifting describes the photons acquiring longer [[wavelength]]s and lower [[frequency|frequencies]] as the [[metric expansion of space|universe expanded over billions of years]], so that they gradually changed from visible light to radio waves. These same photons can still be detected as radio waves today. They form the [[cosmic microwave background]] ("CMB"), and they provide crucial evidence of the early universe and how it developed.

Around the same time as recombination, existing [[pressure wave]]s within the electron-baryon [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] – known as [[baryon acoustic oscillations]] – became embedded in the distribution of matter as it condensed, giving rise to a very slight preference in distribution of large-scale objects. Therefore, the cosmic microwave background is a picture of the universe at the end of this epoch including the tiny fluctuations generated during [[inflation (cosmology)|inflation]] (see diagram), and the spread of objects such as galaxies in the universe is an indication of the scale and size of the universe as it developed over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Amos|first=Jonathan|title=Quasars illustrate dark energy's roller coaster ride|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-20303592|accessdate=13 November 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=2012-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|21 centimeter radiation}}
After [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] and [[decoupling (cosmology)|decoupling]], the universe was transparent and had cooled enough to allow light to travel long distances, but there were no light-producing structures such as [[star]]s and [[galaxy|galaxies]]. Stars and galaxies are formed when dense regions of gas form due to the action of [[gravity]], and this takes a long time within a near-uniform density of gas and on the scale required, so it is estimated that stars did not exist for perhaps hundreds of millions of years after recombination.

This period, known as the [[Dark Ages (cosmology)|Dark Ages]], began around 377,000 years after the Big Bang. During the Dark Ages, the temperature of the universe cooled from some 4000&amp;nbsp;K down to about 60&amp;nbsp;K, and only two sources of photons existed: the photons released during recombination/decoupling (as neutral hydrogen atoms formed), which we can still detect today as the [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB), and photons occasionally released by neutral hydrogen atoms, known as the [[hydrogen line|21&amp;nbsp;cm spin line of neutral hydrogen]]. The hydrogen spin line is in the microwave range of frequencies, and within 3 million years,{{cn|date=October 2018}} the CMB photons had [[redshift]]ed out of visible light to [[infrared]]; from that time until the first stars, there were no visible light photons. Other than perhaps some rare statistical anomalies, the universe was truly dark.

The October 2010 discovery of [[UDFy-38135539]], the first observed galaxy to have existed during the following [[reionization]] epoch, gives us a window into these times. The galaxy earliest in this period observed and thus also the most distant galaxy ever observed is currently on the record of Leiden University's Richard J. Bouwens and Garth D. Illingsworth from UC Observatories/Lick Observatory. They found the galaxy [[UDFj-39546284]] to be at a time some 480 million years after the Big Bang or about halfway through the Cosmic Dark Ages at a distance of about 13.2 billion [[light-years]]. More recently, the [[UDFy-38135539]], [[EGSY8p7]] and [[GN-z11]] galaxies were found to be around 380–550 million years after the Big Bang and at a distance of around 13.4 billion light-years.&lt;ref name="Space-20121212"&gt;{{cite web |last=Wall |first=Mike |title=Ancient Galaxy May Be Most Distant Ever Seen|url=http://www.space.com/18879-hubble-most-distant-galaxy.html |date=December 12, 2012|publisher=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=December 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also currently an [[LOFAR|observational effort]] underway to detect the faint 21&amp;nbsp;cm spin line radiation, as it is in principle an even more powerful tool than the cosmic microwave background for studying the early universe.

Structures may have begun to emerge from around 150 million years, and stars and early galaxies gradually emerged from around 400 to 700 million years. As they emerged, the Dark Ages gradually ended. Because this process was gradual, the Dark Ages only fully ended around 1 billion (1000 million) years, as the universe took its present appearance.

====Speculative "habitable epoch"====
:''ca. 10–17 million years after the Big Bang''

For about 6.6 million years, between about 10 to 17 million years after the Big Bang (redshift 137–100), the background temperature was between 373&amp;nbsp;K and 273&amp;nbsp;K, a temperature compatible with [[liquid water]] and common [[biological]] [[chemical reactions]]. [[Avi Loeb|Loeb]] (2014) speculated that [[Abiogenesis|primitive life]] might in principle have appeared during this window, which he called "the Habitable Epoch of the Early Universe".&lt;ref name="IJA-2014October"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Loeb |first=Abraham |authorlink=Abraham Loeb |title=The Habitable Epoch of the Early Universe |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=9371049&amp;fileId=S1473550414000196 |date=October 2014 |journal=[[International Journal of Astrobiology]] |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=337–339 |doi=10.1017/S1473550414000196 |accessdate=15 December 2014 |bibcode=2014IJAsB..13..337L|arxiv = 1312.0613 |citeseerx=10.1.1.748.4820 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ARXIV-20131202"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Loeb |first=Abraham |authorlink=Abraham Loeb |title=The Habitable Epoch of the Early Universe |journal=International Journal of Astrobiology |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=337–339 |arxiv=1312.0613 |date=December 2013|bibcode = 2014IJAsB..13..337L |doi = 10.1017/S1473550414000196 |citeseerx=10.1.1.748.4820 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20141202"&gt;{{cite news |last=Dreifus |first=Claudia |authorlink=Claudia Dreifus |title=Much-Discussed Views That Go Way Back - Avi Loeb Ponders the Early Universe, Nature and Life |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/02/science/avi-loeb-ponders-the-early-universe-nature-and-life.html |date=2 December 2014 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=3 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Loeb argues that carbon-based life might have evolved in a hypothetical pocket of the early universe that was dense enough both to generate at least one massive star that subsequently releases carbon in a supernova, and that was also dense enough to generate a planet.

Life would also have required a heat differential, rather than just uniform background radiation; this could be provided by naturally-occurring geothermal energy.

===Earliest structures and stars emerge===

[[File:Hubble ultra deep field.jpg|thumb|245px|The [[Hubble Ultra Deep Field]]s often showcase galaxies from an ancient era that tell us what the early Stelliferous Age was like]]
[[File:Hubble - infant galaxy.jpg|thumb|245px|Another Hubble image shows an infant galaxy forming nearby, which means this happened very recently on the cosmological timescale. This shows that new galaxy formation in the universe is still occurring.]]

The [[matter]] in the universe is around 84.5% [[cold dark matter]] and 15.5% "ordinary" matter. Since the start of the matter-dominated era, the dark matter has gradually been gathering in huge spread out (diffuse) [[filament (cosmology)|filaments]] under the effects of [[gravity]]. Ordinary matter eventually gathers together faster than it would otherwise do, because of the presence of these concentrations of dark matter. It is also slightly more dense at regular distances due to early [[baryon acoustic oscillations]] (BAO) which became embedded into the distribution of matter when photons decoupled. Unlike dark matter, ordinary matter can lose energy by many routes, which means that as it collapses, it can lose the energy which would otherwise hold it apart, and collapse more quickly, and into denser forms. Ordinary matter gathers where dark matter is denser, and in those places it collapses into clouds of mainly hydrogen [[gas cloud|gas]]. The first stars and galaxies form from these clouds. Where numerous galaxies have formed, galaxy clusters and superclusters will eventually arise. Large [[void (cosmology)|voids]] with few stars will develop between them, marking where dark matter became less common.

Structure formation in the big bang model proceeds hierarchically, due to [[gravitational collapse]], with smaller structures forming before larger ones. The earliest structures to form are the first stars (known as [[population III stars]]), [[dwarf galaxy|dwarf galaxies]], and [[quasar]]s (which are thought to be bright, early [[active galaxies]] containing a [[supermassive black hole]] surrounded by a inward-spiralling [[accretion disk]] of gas). Before this epoch, the evolution of the universe could be understood through linear cosmological [[perturbation theory]]: that is, all structures could be understood as small deviations from a perfect homogeneous universe. This is computationally relatively easy to study. At this point non-linear structures begin to form, and the [[computational problem]] becomes much more difficult, involving, for example, [[N-body simulation|''N''-body simulation]]s with billions of particles. The [[Bolshoi Cosmological Simulation]] is a high precision simulation of this era.

These Population III stars are also responsible for turning the few light elements that were formed in the Big Bang (hydrogen, helium and small amounts of lithium) into many heavier elements. They can be huge as well as perhaps small – and non-[[metallicity|metallic]] (no elements except hydrogen and helium). The larger stars have very short lifetimes compared to most Main Sequence stars we see today, so they commonly finish burning their hydrogen fuel and explode as [[supernova]]e after mere millions of years, seeding the universe with heavier elements over repeated generations. They mark the start of the [[Stelliferous era|Stelliferous (starry) era]].

As yet, no Population III stars have been found, so our understanding of them is based on [[computational model]]s of their formation and evolution.  Fortunately, observations of the [[Cosmic Microwave Background]] radiation can be used to date when star formation began in earnest.  Analysis of such observations made by the European Space Agency's Planck telescope in 2016 concluded that the first generation of stars formed 700 million years after the Big Bang.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/planck-first-stars-formed-later-than-we-thought ''Planck: First Stars Formed Later Than We Thought''; NASA.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Quasar]]s provides some additional evidence of early structure formation. Their light shows evidence of elements such as [[carbon]], [[magnesium]], [[iron]] and [[oxygen]]. This is evidence that by the time quasars formed, a massive phase of [[star formation]] had already taken place, including sufficient generations of [[population III stars]] to give rise to these elements.

=== Reionization===
{{See also|Reionization|Dwarf galaxy|Quasar}}
As the [[population III star|first stars]], [[dwarf galaxy|dwarf galaxies]] and [[quasar]]s gradually form, the intense radiation they emit reionizes much of the surrounding universe; splitting the neutral hydrogen atoms back into a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] of free [[electron]]s and [[proton]]s for the first time since [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] and [[decoupling (cosmology)|decoupling]].

Reionization is evidenced from observations of [[quasar]]s. Quasars are a form of [[active galaxy]], and the most luminous objects observed in the universe. Electrons in neutral hydrogen have a specific patterns of absorbing photons, related to electron energy levels and called the [[Lyman series]]. Ionized hydrogen does not have electron energy levels of this kind. Therefore, light travelling through ionized hydrogen and neutral hydrogen shows different absorption lines. In addition, the light will have travelled for billions of years to reach us, so any absorption by neutral hydrogen will have been redshifted by varied amounts, rather than by one specific amount, indicating when it happened. These features make it possible to study the state of ionization at many different times in the past. They show that reionization began as "bubbles" of ionized hydrogen which became larger over time.&lt;ref name="dijkstra"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Lyα Emitting Galaxies as a Probe of Reionization|date=5 August 2014|first=Mark|last=Dijkstra|journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of Australia|doi=10.1017/pasa.2014.33|volume=31|arxiv = 1406.7292}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also show that the absorption was due to the general state of the universe (the [[intergalactic medium]]) and not due to passing through galaxies or other dense areas.&lt;ref name="dijkstra" /&gt; Reionization might have started as early as ''z''=16 (250 million years of cosmic time) and was complete by around ''z''=9 or 10 (500 million years). The epoch of reionization probably ended by around ''z''=5 or 6 (1 billion years) as the era of Population III stars and quasars – and their intense radiation – came to an end, and the ionized hydrogen gradually reverted to neutral atoms.&lt;ref name="dijkstra" /&gt;

These observations have narrowed down the period of time during which reionization took place, but the source of the photons that caused reionization is still not completely certain. To ionize neutral hydrogen, an energy larger than 13.6 [[electronvolt|eV]] is required, which corresponds to [[ultraviolet]] photons with a wavelength of 91.2 [[nanometre|nm]] or shorter, implying that the sources must have produced significant amount of ultraviolet and higher energy. Protons and electrons will recombine if energy is not continuously provided to keep them apart, which also sets limits on how numerous the sources were and their longevity.&lt;ref name="qso_source1"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Piero Madau | display-authors=etal | date=1999 | title=Radiative Transfer in a Clumpy Universe.

However, by this time, matter had become far more spread out due to the ongoing expansion of the universe. Although the neutral hydrogen atoms were again ionized, the plasma was much more thin and diffuse, and photons were much less likely to be scattered. Despite being reionized, the universe remained largely transparent during reionization. As the universe continued to cool and expand, reionization gradually ended.

Matter continues to draw together under the influence of [[gravity]], to form [[galaxy|galaxies]]. The stars from this time period, known as  [[Stellar population|Population II]] stars, are formed early on in this process, with more recent [[Stellar population|Population I]] stars formed later. Gravitational attraction also gradually pulls galaxies towards each other to form groups, [[galactic cluster|cluster]]s and [[supercluster]]s.

== Current appearance of the Universe==

The universe has appeared much the same as it does now, for many billions of years. It will continue to look similar for many more billions of years into the future.

Based upon the emerging science of [[nucleocosmochronology]], the Galactic thin disk of the Milky Way is estimated to have been formed 8.8 ± 1.7 billion years ago.&lt;ref name=Peloso/&gt;

=== Dark energy dominated era===
{{main|dark energy|Scale factor (cosmology)}}
:''From about 9.8 billion years after the Big bang''
From about 9.8 billion years of cosmic time,&lt;ref name="ryden" /&gt; the universe's large-scale behavior is believed to have gradually changed for the third time in its history. Its behavior had originally been dominated by radiation ([[special relativity|relativistic]] constituents such as photons and neutrinos) for the first 47,000 years, and since about 377,000 years of cosmic time, its behavior had been dominated by [[matter]]. During its matter-dominated era, the expansion of the universe had begun to slow down, as [[gravity]] reigned in the initial outward expansion. But from about 9.8 billion years of cosmic time, observations show that that the expansion of the universe slowly stops decelerating, and gradually begins to accelerate again, instead. 

While the precise cause is not known, the observation is accepted as correct by the cosmologist community. By far the most accepted understanding is that this is due to an unknown form of energy which has been given the name "[[dark energy]]".&lt;ref name="NYT-20170220"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=Cosmos Controversy: The Universe Is Expanding, but How Fast? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/20/science/hubble-constant-universe-expanding-speed.html |date=20 February 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=21 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="peebles"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The cosmological constant and dark energy|year=2003|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|arxiv=astro-ph/0207347|volume=75|issue=2|pages=559–606|doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.75.559|bibcode=2003RvMP...75..559P|last1=Peebles|first1=P.

Research is ongoing to understand this dark energy. Dark energy is now believed to be the single largest component of the universe, as it constitutes about 68.3% of the entire [[mass-energy]] of the physical universe.

Dark energy is believed to act like a [[cosmological constant]] - a [[scalar field]] that exists throughout space. Unlike gravity, the effects of such a field do not diminish (or only diminish slowly) as the universe grows. While matter and gravity have a greater effect initially, their effect quickly diminishes as the universe continues to expand. Objects in the universe, which are initially seen to be moving apart as the universe expands, continue to move apart, but their outward motion gradually slows down. This slowing effect becomes smaller as the universe becomes more spread out. Eventually, the outward and repulsive effect of dark energy begins to dominate over the inward pull of gravity. Instead of slowing down and perhaps beginning to move inward under the influence of gravity, from about 9.8 billion years of cosmic time, the expansion of space starts to slowly accelerate ''outward'' at a gradually ''increasing'' rate.

==Far future and ultimate fate==
{{Main|Ultimate fate of the universe|Timeline of the far future}}
{{further|Future of an expanding universe|Heat death of the universe}}

The universe has existed for around 13.8 billion years, and we believe that we understand it well enough to predict its large-scale development for many billions of years into the future – perhaps as much as 100 billion years of cosmic time (about 86 billion years from now). Beyond that, we need to better understand the universe to make any accurate predictions. Therefore, the universe could follow a variety of different paths beyond this time.

There are several competing scenarios for the possible long-term evolution of the universe. Which of them will happen, if any, depends on the precise values of [[physical constant]]s such as the [[cosmological constant]], the possibility of [[proton decay]], the [[False vacuum|energy of the vacuum]] (meaning, the energy of [[Vacuum state|"empty" space]] itself), and the natural laws [[beyond the Standard Model]].

If the expansion of the universe continues and it stays in its present form, eventually all but the nearest galaxies will be carried away from us by the [[metric expansion of space|expansion of space]] at such a velocity that our [[observable universe]] will be limited to [[Laniakea Supercluster|our own]] gravitationally bound local [[galactic cluster]]. In the very long term (after many trillions – thousands of billions – of years, cosmic time), the [[Stelliferous Era]] will end, as stars cease to be born and even the [[red dwarf star|longest-lived stars]] gradually die. Beyond this, all objects in the universe will cool and (with the [[proton decay|possible exception of protons]]) gradually decompose back to their constituent particles and then into subatomic particles and very low level photons and other [[fundamental particle]]s, by a variety of possible processes. But this will take a duration of time that is almost inconceivable to most people, compared to which the entire 13.8 billion years of the universe would be a tiny instant in time.

Ultimately, in the extreme future, the following scenarios have been proposed for the ultimate fate of the universe.

| '''[[Heat death of the universe|Heat Death]]'''
| As expansion continues, the universe becomes larger, colder, and more dilute; in time, all structures eventually decompose to subatomic particles and photons.

This will happen only after an extremely long time because first, all matter will collapse into [[black hole]]s, which will then evaporate extremely slowly via [[Hawking radiation]]. The universe in this scenario will cease to be able to support life much earlier than this, after some 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; years or so, when  [[star formation]] ceases.&lt;ref name=dying&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1997RvMP...69..337A |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.69.337|title=A dying universe: The long-term fate and evolutionof astrophysical objects|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|volume=69|issue=2|pages=337–372|last1=Adams|first1=Fred C|last2=Laughlin|first2=Gregory|year=1997|arxiv=astro-ph/9701131}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&amp;nbsp;§IID.&lt;/sup&gt;  In some [[grand unified theories]], [[proton decay]] after at least 10&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt; years will convert the remaining interstellar gas and stellar remnants into leptons (such as positrons and electrons) and photons.

| '''[[Big Rip]]'''
| Expansion of space accelerates and at some point becomes so extreme that even subatomic particles and the fabric of [[spacetime]] are pulled apart and unable to exist.
| For sufficiently large values for the [[dark energy]] content of the universe, the expansion rate of the universe will continue to increase without limit. Gravitationally bound systems, such as clusters of galaxies, galaxies, and ultimately the Solar System will be torn apart. Eventually the expansion will be so rapid as to overcome the electromagnetic forces holding molecules and atoms together. Even atomic nuclei will be torn apart. Finally, forces and interactions even on the [[Planck scale]] – the smallest size for which the notion of "space" currently has a meaning – will no longer be able to occur as the fabric of [[spacetime]] itself is pulled apart and the universe as we know it will end in an unusual kind of singularity.
|-
| '''[[Big Crunch]]'''
| Expansion eventually slows and halts, then reverses as all matter accelerates towards its common centre. Not now considered likely.
| In the opposite of the "Big Rip" scenario, the [[metric expansion of space]] would at some point be reversed and the universe would contract towards a hot, dense state. This is a required element of [[oscillatory universe]] scenarios, such as the [[cyclic model]], although a Big Crunch does not necessarily imply an oscillatory universe. Current observations suggest that this model of the universe is unlikely to be correct, and the expansion will continue or even accelerate.
|-
| '''[[Vacuum instability]]'''
| Collapse of the [[quantum field]]s that  underpin all forces, particles and structures, to a different form.
| Cosmology traditionally has assumed a stable or at least  [[metastability|metastable]] universe, but the possibility of a [[false vacuum]] in [[quantum field theory]] implies that the universe at any point in spacetime might spontaneously collapse into a lower energy state (see [[Bubble nucleation]]), a more stable or "true vacuum", which would then expand outward from that point with the speed of light.&lt;ref name="turnerwilczek"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Is our vacuum metastable? |journal=Nature |volume=298 |date=1982 |issue=5875 |pages=633–634 |doi=10.1038/298633a0 |bibcode=1982Natur.298..633T |url=http://ctp.lns.mit.edu/Wilczek_Nature/%2872%29vacuum_metastable.pdf |access-date=2015-10-31|last1=Turner |first1=M.

H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect would be that the [[quantum field]]s that  underpin all forces, particles and structures, would undergo a transition to a more stable form. New forces and particles would replace the present ones we know of, with the side effect that all current particles, forces and structures would be destroyed and subsequently (if able) reform into different particles, forces and structures.

In this kind of extreme timescale, extremely rare [[quantum mechanics|quantum phenomena]] may also occur that are extremely unlikely to be seen on a timescale smaller than trillions of years. These may also lead to unpredictable changes to the state of the universe which would not be likely to be significant on any smaller timescale. For example, on a timescale of millions of trillions of years, [[black hole]]s might appear to evaporate almost instantly, uncommon [[quantum tunneling]] phenomena would appear to be common, and quantum (or other) phenomena so unlikely that they might occur just once in a trillion years may occur many times.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3678">A '''crash cover''' is a [[Philately|philatelic]] term for a type of [[Cover (philately)|cover]],  (including the terms '''air accident cover''', '''interrupted flight cover''', '''wreck cover''') meaning an envelope or package that has been recovered from a [[fixed-wing aircraft]], [[airship]] or [[aeroplane]] crash, train wreck, [[shipwreck]] or other accident. Crash covers are a type of [[interrupted mail]].

[[File:Crash Cover Nov 2 1929.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Example of a salvaged U.S. Air Mail Crash Cover (CAM #24, Indianapolis, IN, Nov. 2, 1929)]] [[Aviation accidents and incidents|Crashes]] of flights carrying [[airmail]] were a regular occurrence from the earliest days of mail transport by air. In many cases of [[aircraft]] crashes, train wreck and shipwrecks, it was possible to recover some or even all of the mail being carried, with perhaps some charring around the edges of some pieces if there had been a fire, or water damage from [[flying boat]] crashes or shipwrecks. In such cases, the authorities typically apply a [[postal marking]] (cachet), label, or [[mimeograph]] that gets affixed to the cover explaining the delay and damage to the recipient, and possibly enclose the letter in an "ambulance cover" or "body bag" if it was badly damaged and then send it to its intended destination.

Aviation related crash covers are a specialised collecting area of [[aerophilately]] and are much-prized items of [[postal history]], because they are generally rare, but as tangible artifacts of often-tragic accidents they have a story to tell. The 367 covers salvaged from the [[Hindenburg disaster|''Hindenburg'' disaster]] are especially desirable,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mapsnewyork.org/covers/crash.html Collecting Air Crash Covers]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/museum/1d_Hindenburg.html Hindenburg crash covers]&lt;/ref&gt; with prices ranging from US$10,000 and up; a cover at the [[Corinphila]] auction in May 2001 realized 85,000 Swiss francs (US$75,000).

The [[American Air Mail Society]] has a "Crash Cover Committee" specializing in the study of crash covers. There is also a Wreck &amp; Crash Mail Society, whose members collect all types of crash &amp; wreck covers.

==Early life==
Monn was born and raised in [[Fayetteville, Pennsylvania|Fayetteville]], Pennsylvania as one of six children. As a child, he showed an early interest in fashion design with hopes of attending the [[Parsons School of Design]]. In 1981 at age 18, Monn earned a job at Butte Knit, a clothing factory in his town that was a part of the Jonathan Logan Corporation. This job soon led him to New York City where he rented a studio apartment near [[Mindy Grossman]]'s. While in New York, Monn took up interior decorating for himself and his friends (including Grossman).&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haute"/&gt;

==Career==
Prior to beginning his event and interior design career, Monn worked in the jewelry business for 12 years. In 2003, Gayfryd Steinberg hired Monn as the event planner and designer for the Library Lions Gala at the New York Public Library's main campus. Since then, Monn has been designing events for a wide variety of occasions.&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sun"&gt;{{cite news | last=Gordon| first=Amanda| title =Authentic, Simple &amp; Refined: A Night With David Monn| newspaper =[[The New York Sun]]| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =| date =August 14, 2008 | url =http://www.nysun.com/out-and-about/authentic-simple-refined-a-night-with-david-monn/83889/| accessdate =March 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, he managed the festivities for the grand opening of the [[Time Warner Center]]. The following year, Monn was responsible for the design of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's [[Costume Institute Gala]].&lt;ref name="NYTInf"&gt;{{cite news | last=Trebay| first=Guy| title =Influencers Are Forever| newspaper =[[The New York Times]]| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =| date =June 26, 2005 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/26/fashion/sundaystyles/influencers-are-forever.html| accessdate =March 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2007, his clients included the Guggenheim Museum, [[LVMH]], and the [[Metropolitan Opera]] (among others).&lt;ref name="Haute"/&gt; In November 2007, Monn designed the [[Frank Gehry]]-inspired Guggenheim International Gala at [[Pier 40 at Hudson River Park|Pier 40]].&lt;ref name="Bash"/&gt; He also designed the 100th anniversary celebration for the [[Plaza Hotel]] that year.&lt;ref name="NYDN"&gt;{{cite news | last=Huguenin| first=Patrick| title =Event planner's the life of the party| newspaper =[[New York Daily News]]| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =| date =December 15, 2007 | url =http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/event-planner-life-party-article-1.276028| accessdate =March 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010, Monn designed the [[White House]] State Dinner honoring then [[Mexican President]] [[Felipe Calderón]].&lt;ref name="NYTShopping"/&gt; In November 2016, he released his book, ''David Monn: The Art of Celebrating'', which contains 360 pages of images and text about events he has planned and designed. The book's release date was marked with a party at the New York Public Library's main campus.&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WWD"/&gt; In January 2017, Monn designed an opening candlelight dinner for the inauguration festivities of President [[Donald Trump]].&lt;ref name="WP90"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTTrump"&gt;{{cite news | last=Bernstein| first=Jacob| title =How Anna Wintour's Longtime Party Planner Turned to Trump| newspaper =[[The New York Times]]| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =| date =January 18, 2017 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/18/fashion/inauguration-donald-trump-stephanie-winston-wolkoff.html?_r=0| accessdate =March 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Diminished value''', Diminution in Value, or commonly referred to as "DV" are the terms generally used to describe the economic loss in a property's value as a result of having been damaged. Diminished Value (DV) is often associated with vehicles that have been damaged, however, it is applicable to other property of value including collectibles such as jewelry, artwork, etc. For the purposes herein, reference will involve the loss in value of a damaged automobile where the term is often applied.

Unlike "depreciation", which is an anticipated and predictable loss in value over time, ‘Inherent Diminished Value’ is a loss in value due to a specific, sudden and unexpected negative occurrence. Diminished value of an automobile following an accident may occur in one of three ways (or a combination thereof):

(1) repair-related diminished value;

(2) Immediate diminished value; and

(3) inherent diminished value.

'''Repair-related diminished value''' is the loss of value due to the inability to perfectly repair the vehicle, so it is worth less after repairs than it was before the wreck. '''Immediate Diminished Value''' – The difference in resale value of a vehicle immediately before damage has occurred and immediately after damage has occurred (prior to repair).  As courts are rarely the chosen venue for recovery of property damage, the standard of "Immediate Diminished Value" is rarely employed in resolving Property Damage claims. This also refers to a loss of value caused by the insurer's direct involvement in the claim adjustment in which the insurer exerts control over the repairs and repairs are incomplete, insufficiently performed, or otherwise restore the vehicle to less than the standard condition.

'''Inherent Diminished Value''' - Assumes optimal repair quality has been achieved and is defined as the amount by which the resale value of a repaired vehicle has been reduced simply because the subject vehicle now has a significant damage history. This is the most widely recognized and accepted form of Diminished Value. It is also the basis upon which any supplemental form of Diminished Value would be added. A common "Supplemental" form of Diminished Value is "Repair Related Diminished Value".

Usually, a frame or structurally damaged vehicle cannot be re-sold as a "[[certified pre-owned]] vehicle."

The true measure of a damaged vehicle's inherent loss in value can be measured as the difference in the value of the vehicle before the loss to that after the loss, prior to or after repair. The standard rule as to establishing a value on late model vehicles would be: 20-25% behind book (Black Book, KBB, NADA) and utilize actual sales results, and not on advertised prices.

While some may claim Diminished Value (DV) is subjective and based upon perception or speculation, the old adage "perception becomes reality' applies and as such Diminution in Value is real simply because, for the most part, no reasonable and prudent person is willing to pay the same price for a vehicle with a history of damage as they would for one never having been damaged. Retailers often offer discounts for scratches and dents on appliances, electronics and dented canned goods; it is, therefore, reasonable that the value of a damaged motor vehicle will suffer a lessening in value.

Additional factors may be taken into consideration in evaluating the loss in value of a damaged and repaired vehicle and may include, but not be limited to: the vehicle itself (i.e. rare collectible, originality, market desirability etc.), the vehicle’s pre-loss condition, severity of the sustained damages (i.e. frame damage, flood, fire etc.), the subject vehicle’s history (i.e. one owner, prior damage/repair, death of occupants etc.), quality and thoroughness of the performed repairs, (i.e. quality of parts, materials, workmanship, etc.) and additional value considerations including, but not limited to values associated with pre-owned certification programs.etc.

Auto insurance companies may not readily recognize or offer to pay for diminished value. Each state may have differing opinions of DV. Example; The state of Georgia allows the insured party (the first-party Policyholder) to make a claim for their remaining economic loss for DV from their own insurance company while the neighboring state of Florida does not. Most states, however, allow the victim of another's negligence (third-party) to make a DV claim from the at-fault party.

The length of time to collect Diminished Value will vary depending upon each state's statute of limitations for first party (contractual) claims and third-party (restatement of tort) claims.

==Diminished Value Appraisal==
{{original research|section|date=January 2013}}
A diminished value [[wikt:appraisal|appraisal]] evaluates the difference in value of a [[motor vehicle]] after a collision repair. Reports are usually compiled by an Auto Appraisal Expert experienced in the field of DV and who may provide expert testimony for Appraisals, Arbitration, Mediation or Litigation in a court of law. This Assessment report is used when filing or disputing a diminished value claim against another party and/or an [[insurance]] company. The report measures a damaged vehicle’s inherent loss in value. The diminished value can be measured as the difference in the value of the vehicle before the loss to that after the loss, prior to or after repair. In most cases even if the repair was done expertly, the value of the automobile will still be considerably less after a loss. When consumers find that a vehicle has been in an accident, most consumers will never pay the same price for a repaired vehicle as compared to one with no loss history.

Some reports include an assessment of the damage done to a motor vehicle, the quality of the performed repair, the market value of the vehicle before and after the accident.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.diminishedvalue.law/info-center/how-to-prove-diminished-value-of-a-vehicle/|title=Coffey Trial Law - Diminished Value|website=www.diminishedvalue.law|language=en|access-date=2017-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;There are no set rules for measuring diminished value, and since every vehicle loses value differently, a one size fits all formula would be fundamentally inaccurate.

==Regional==
Recognition of concept of diminished value varies from country to country {{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

===United States===
Some states' statutes acknowledge diminished value and provide the ability for consumers to collect first party claims of DV from their own insurance companies under their own policies. Most states allow the consumer to collect third party claims from the at-fault driver's insurance company. Some states recognize liability for third party claims but not first party claims.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mwl-law.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/diminution-of-value-in-all-50-states.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Georgia===
In Georgia, vehicle owners can collect DV against their own policy.

=== Florida ===
Diminished value is part of the Florida Standard Civil Jury Instructions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Florida Standard Jury Instructions - Civil|url=http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/civ_jury_instructions/instructions.shtml#500|publisher=State of Florida|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diminished value [[case law]] in Florida is based primarily on two cases.

* Siegle vs. Progressive Consumer's Insurance Company, '''819 So.2d 732''' (Florida 2002).
The ability to receive diminished value [[financial compensation]] from an at-fault driver for their negligence was decided by the [[Florida Supreme Court]] in the Siegle vs. Progressive Consumer's Insurance Company case.  After Siegle insurance companies are able to exclude responsibility for the payment of diminished value to the vehicle that they insure through the language in the policy.
* McHale vs. Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Co. '''409 So.2d 238''' (1982)
The [[Florida Third District Court of Appeal]], upheld that the correct measure of damages is the cost of repair plus any reduction in the value of the vehicle. The Court also directed that proving the reduction in value is the burden of the [[Plaintiff]] bringing the claim.

=== Louisiana ===
Diminished value is provided in [http://legis.la.gov/legis/Law.aspx?d=408380 Louisiana Revised Statute 9:2800.17].  The vehicle owner must prove by a preponderance of evidence that the fair market value would be less than its value before the vehicle was damaged.

===Washington===
On July 15, 2014, a policyholder in Washington state filed a proposed class action lawsuit in the Superior Court of Pierce County seeking diminished value insurance benefits under their automobile insurance policies.  The insurance company filed a notice to remove the lawsuit to federal district court on August 20, 2014.  The case is titled ''Johnston v. United Services Automobile Ass'n''.

===Canada===
The ability to recover damages for accelerated depreciation varies from Province to Province.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

In [[British Columbia]], law recognizes this loss as a recoverable damage and quantify the claim based on the diminished value at the time the collision occurs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/LOC/freeside/--%20c%20--/court%20rules%20act%20rsbc%201996%20c.%2080/05_regulations/19_168_2009%20supreme%20court%20civil%20rules/168_2009_02.xml Rule 11-2 BC Supreme Court]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rules addressing the admissibility of depreciation reports in court vary by jurisdiction.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}  For example, in British Columbia, Canada, [http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/LOC/freeside/--%20C%20--/Court%20Rules%20Act%20RSBC%201996%20c.%2080/05_Regulations/19_168_2009%20Supreme%20Court%20Civil%20Rules/168_2009_02.xml#part11 the BC Supreme Court requires such reports to comply with Rule 11].

''' Event management''' is the application of [[project management]] to the creation and development of large-scale events such as [[festival]]s, conferences, ceremonies, weddings, formal parties, concerts, or [[convention (meeting)|conventions]]. It involves studying the brand, identifying its [[target audience]], devising the event concept, and coordinating the technical aspects before actually launching the event.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsborg, G.C.; B Miller, D Breiter, BJ Reed &amp; A Rushing (eds), ''Professional meeting management: Comprehensive strategies for meetings, conventions and events'', 2008, 5th ed, Kendall/Hunt Publishing, Dubuque, Iowa. {{ISBN|0-7575-5212-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of planning and coordinating the event is usually referred to as '''event planning''' and which can include budgeting, scheduling, site selection, acquiring necessary [[License|permit]]s, coordinating transportation and parking, arranging for speakers or entertainers, arranging decor, event security, [[catering]], coordinating with third party vendors, and emergency plans. Each event is different in its nature so process of planning &amp; execution of each event differs on basis of type of event. 

The events industry now includes events of all sizes from the [[Olympics]] down to business breakfast meetings. Many industries, [[charitable organization]]s, and interest groups hold events in order to market themselves, build business relationships, raise money, or celebrate achievement.

==Marketing tool==

Event management might be a tool for [[Marketing strategy|strategic marketing]] and communication, used by companies of every size. Companies can benefit from promotional events as a way to communicate with current and potential customers.  For instance, these advertising-focused events can occur as press conferences, promotional events, or product launches.

Event managers may also use traditional news media in order to target their audience, hoping to generate media coverage which will reach thousands or millions of people. They can also invite their audience to their events and reach them at the actual event.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Event manager==

The '''event manager''' is the person who plans and executes the event, taking responsibility for the creative, technical, and logistical elements.  This includes overall event design, brand building, marketing and communication strategy, [[audio-visual]] production, script writing, logistics, budgeting, negotiation, and client service.

==Event venue==
An event venue may be an onsite or offsite location. The event manager is usually not responsible for operations at rented event or entertainment venues, but will monitor all aspects of the event on site. Some of the tasks listed in the introduction may pass to the venue, but usually at a cost.

Corporate event managers book event venues to host corporate meetings, conferences, networking events, trade shows, product launches, team building retreats or training sessions in a more tailored environment.

== Sustainability ==
[[Sustainable event management]] (also known as event greening) is the process used to produce an event with particular concern for environmental, economic, and social issues.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/management-standards/iso20121.htm ISO 20121 - Sustainable events]", ISO (www.iso.org), retrieved 2014-30-05&lt;/ref&gt; Sustainability in event management incorporates socially and environmentally responsible decision making into the planning, organization and implementation of, and participation in, an event. It involves including sustainable development principles and practices in all levels of event organization, and aims to ensure that an event is hosted responsibly. It represents the total package of interventions at an event, and needs to be done in an integrated manner. Event greening should start at the inception of the project, and should involve all the key role players, such as clients, organizers, venues, sub-contractors, and suppliers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwf.panda.org/get_involved/live_green/at_the_office/green_events/|title=Organizing a Green Event|publisher=[[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==

[[Event management software]] companies provide [[event planning|event planners]] with software tools to handle many common activities such as delegate registration, hotel booking, travel booking, or allocation of exhibition floorspace.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

A recent trend in event technology is the use of mobile apps for events. Event mobile apps have a range of uses. They can be used to hold relatively static information such as the agenda, speaker biographies, and general FAQs. They can also encourage audience participation and engagement through interactive tools such as live voting/polling, submitting questions to speakers during Q&amp;A, or building live interactive "word clouds". Mobile event apps can also be used by event organisers as a means of communication. Organisers can communicate with participants through the use of alerts, notifications, and push messages. They can also be used to collect feedback from the participants through the use of surveys in app. Going a step further, some mobile event apps can also help participants to engage with each other, with sponsors, and with the organisers with built-in networking functionality.

==Education==
There are an increasing number of [[universities]] which offer courses in event management, including diplomas and graduate degrees. In addition to these academic courses, there are many associations and societies that provide courses on the various aspects of the [[industry]]. Study includes organizational skills, technical knowledge, [[public relations]], [[marketing]], [[advertising]], [[catering]], [[logistics]], [[Interior design|decor]], glamor identity, human relations, study of law and licenses, risk management, budgeting, and the study of allied industries like television, other media, and several other areas. Certification can be acquired from various sources to obtain designations such as 
*Certified Trade Show Marketer (CTSM)
*Certified in Exhibition Management (CEM)
*Global Certification in Meeting Management (CMM)
*[[Certified Meeting Professional]] (CMP)
*Global Certificate in Event Design (EDC) 
*Certified Special Event Professional (CSEP) 
*Certified Quality Event Planner (CQEP)

'''Event videography''' is a [[video production]], the art of capturing social and special events onto video by a [[videographer]]. The term is used to describe the [[videography]] of any event, aside from weddings and [[wedding videography]].

==History==
Event videography is an offshoot of wedding videography and encompasses the video documentation of social functions, such as [[First Communion]]s, anniversaries, dance recitals, bar mitzvahs, color guard contests, [[prom]]s, concerts, etc.

Event videography started shortly after the introduction of consumer-based video cameras, or [[camcorders]], in the late 1970s, as videographers, who had businesses documenting weddings, began to look for other [[Market (economics)|market]]s to offer their services.

==Event videography today==
The art of event videography is somewhat similar today as it was back when the camcorder was first introduced. The main differences lie in the improved video camera technology and equipment. Advances in [[High-definition video|high definition]] technology are being applied to event videography.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2453">A '''farewell speech''' or '''farewell address''' is a speech given by an individual leaving a position or place. They are often used by public figures such as politicians as a to the preceding career, or as statements delivered by persons relating to reasons for their leaving. The term is often used as a euphemism for "retirement speech", though it is broader in that it may include geographical or even biological conclusion. In the [[Classics]], a term for a dignified and poetic farewell speech is ''apobaterion'' (ἀποβατήριον), standing opposed to the ''epibaterion'', the corresponding speech made upon arrival.

== U.S. presidential farewell addresses ==
Many U.S. presidential speeches have been given the moniker "farewell address" since George Washington's address in 1796.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4624166/presidential-farewell-addresses/|title=Barack Obama's Farewell Address and 6 Other Memorable Presidential Goodbyes|website=Time|language=en|access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some notable examples:

* [[George Washington]] – [[George Washington's Farewell Address|Washington's Farewell Address]] where he warned of the dangers of [[Political party|political parties]] and [[Washington Doctrine of Unstable Alliances|foreign alliances]].

*[[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] – [[Eisenhower's farewell address]] where he warned of the [[military–industrial complex]].
*[[Barack Obama]] – [[Barack Obama's farewell address|Obama's farewell address]] made from Chicago, breaking tradition of holding one in the White House.

==Other notable farewell speeches==

*The speech of [[Aeneas]] to [[Helenus]] and [[Andromache]], ''[[Aeneid]]'', Book III.
*[[Robert E. Lee]] – [[Lee's Farewell Address]] to the [[Army of Northern Virginia]] the day after the end of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].
*[[Douglas MacArthur]] – farewell speeches before [[United States Congress|Congress]] and [[United States Military Academy|U.S. Military Academy]]; "[[Wikisource:MacArthur's Farewell Speech to Congress|old soldiers never die, they only fade away]]" and "[[Wikisource:Duty, honor, country|duty, honor, country]]".

'''Fictitious''' or '''fake entries''' are deliberately incorrect entries in [[reference work]]s such as [[Dictionary|dictionaries]], [[encyclopedia]]s, maps, and directories. There are more specific terms for particular kinds of fictitious entry, such as Mountweazel, [[trap street]], paper street, paper town, [[phantom settlement]], and [[:wikt:nihilartikel|nihilartikel]].&lt;ref name="worldwidewords1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/weirdwords/ww-nih1.htm |title=Nihilartikel |publisher=World Wide Words |date= |accessdate=April 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fictitious entries are included either as a humorous hoax or as a '''copyright trap''' to reveal subsequent [[plagiarism]] or [[copyright infringement]]. 

==Terminology==
The [[neologism]] ''Mountweazel'' was coined by ''[[The New Yorker]]'' based on a fictitious biographical entry in the 1975 ''[[New Columbia Encyclopedia]]''.&lt;ref name=mountweazel&gt;Henry Alford, [http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/08/29/050829ta_talk_alford "Not a Word"], ''The New Yorker'' August 29, 2005 (accessed August 29, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''nihilartikel'', combining the Latin ''nihil'' ("nothing") and German ''Artikel'' ("article"), is sometimes used.&lt;ref name="worldwidewords1"/&gt;

== Copyright traps ==
By including a trivial piece of false information in a larger work, it is easier to demonstrate subsequent [[plagiarism]] if the fictitious entry is copied along with other material. An admission of this motive appears in the preface to [[Chambers Harrap|Chambers']] 1964 [[mathematical tables]]: "those [errors] that are known to exist form an uncomfortable trap for any would-be plagiarist".&lt;ref&gt;L. J. Comrie, ''Chambers's Shorter Six-Figure Mathematical Tables'', Edinburgh: W. &amp; R. Chambers, 1964, p. vi.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[trap street]]s may be included in a [[map]], or invented phone numbers in a [[telephone directory]].

Fictitious entries may be used to demonstrate copying, but to prove legal infringement, the material must also be shown to be eligible for copyright (see [[Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service|''Feist v. Rural'']], [[Trivial Pursuit#Fred Worth lawsuit|Fred Worth lawsuit]] or ''Nester's Map &amp; Guide Corp. v. Hagstrom Map Co.'', 796 F.Supp. 729, [[U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York|E.D.N.Y.]], 1992.)&lt;ref&gt;Fred Greguras, [https://web.archive.org/web/20050301065154/http://oikoumene.com/databprotect.html U.S. Legal Protection for Databases], Presentation at the Technology Licensing Forum September 25, 1996. Archived March 1, 2005 on the [[Internet Archive]].&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Official sources ===
Most listings of the members of the [[German parliament]] feature the fictitious politician [[Jakob Maria Mierscheid]], allegedly a member of the parliament since 1979. Among other activities he is reported to have contributed to a major symposium on the equally fictitious [[stone louse]] in Frankfurt.

=== Reference works ===
Fictitious entries in reference publications often occur in an attempt to catch plagiarism, such as: 

* In August 2005, ''[[New Oxford American Dictionary|The New Oxford American Dictionary]]'' gained media coverage&lt;ref name="mountweazel" /&gt; when it was leaked that the second edition contained at least one fictional entry. This later was determined to be the word ''[[esquivalience]]'', defined as "the wilful avoidance of one's official responsibilities," which had been added to the edition published in 2001. It was intended as a copyright trap, as the text of the book was distributed electronically and thus very easy to copy.
* [[Joel Whitburn]]'s pop chart research books say that [[Ralph Marterie]]'s version of "The Song of Love" peaked at No. 84 for the week ending December 26, 1955. However, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' did not put out an issue that week, and Marterie never recorded this song. A similar situation occurs in his compilation of ''Billboard''{{'}}s rock charts, where Whitburn includes the fictitious song "Drag You Down" by the equally non-existent group "The Cysterz".

=== Maps ===
Fictitious entries on maps may be called [[phantom settlement]]s, [[trap streets]],&lt;ref&gt;SA Mathieson, [https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2006/may/11/copyright.epublic "A sidestep in the right direction"], ''The Guardian'', May 11, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; paper towns, cartographer's follies, or other names. They are intended to help unmask copyright infringements.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gizmodo.com/the-fake-places-that-only-exist-to-catch-copycat-cartog-1695414770 Gizmodo: "Fake places that exist to catch copycats"]&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 1978, the fictional [[Ohio]] towns of [[Beatosu and Goblu]] were inserted into that year's official state of [[Michigan]] map as nods to the [[University of Michigan]] and its traditional rival, [[Ohio State University|The Ohio State University]].&lt;ref name="Monmonier"&gt;{{cite book | last = Monmonier | first = Mark | title = How to Lie with Maps | publisher = University of Chicago Press | location = Chicago | year = 1996 | isbn = 0-226-53421-9 |pages= 50–51 |edition=2nd.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The fictional town of [[Agloe, New York]], was invented by map makers, but eventually became identified as a real place by its county administration because a building, the Agloe General Store, was erected at its fictional location. The "town" is featured in the novel ''[[Paper Towns]]'' by [[John Green (author)|John Green]] and its [[Paper Towns (film)|film adaptation]].
* Mount Richard, a fictitious peak on the [[continental divide]] in the United States, appeared on county maps in the early 1970s. It was believed to be the work of a draftsman, Richard Ciacci. The fiction was undiscovered for two years.&lt;ref name="Monmonier" /&gt;
* In the United Kingdom in 2001, the [[Ordnance Survey]] (OS) obtained a  £20m out-of-court settlement from [[The Automobile Association|Automobile Association]] (the AA) after content from OS maps was reproduced on AA maps.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130521130707/http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/media/news/2001/march/centrica.html "Centrica and Ordnance Survey settle AA copyright case"], March 5, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ordnance Survey denied that it included "deliberate mistakes" in its maps as copyright traps, claiming the "fingerprints" which identified a copy were stylistic features such as the width of roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Andrew Clark |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/mar/06/andrewclark |title=Copying maps costs AA £20m |newspaper=The Guardian |date=March 6, 2001 |accessdate=April 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The fictitious English town of [[Argleton]] was investigated by [[Steve Punt]] in an episode of the BBC Radio 4 programme ''Punt P.I''. The programme concluded that the town's entry may well have originated as a copyright trap.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00trzfl ''Punt PI''], BBC Radio 4, September 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trivia books, etc. ===

*''[[The Trivia Encyclopedia]]'' placed deliberately false information about the first name of TV detective [[Columbo]] for copy-trap purposes and then sued [[Trivial Pursuit]] (which based some of their questions and answers on the work), without success.

=== Other copyright infringement ===
Other examples of copyright infringement that do not fall under the above categories include: 

* In the summer of 2008, the state-owned Slovak Hydrometeorological Institute ({{lang-sk|Slovenský hydrometeorologický ústav, short: SHMÚ}}) became suspicious that a competing commercial service, the website meteo.sk, was stealing their data. On August 7, 2008, SHMÚ deliberately altered the temperature for [[Chopok]] from 9.5&amp;nbsp;°C to 1&amp;nbsp;°C. In a short time, the temperature of 1&amp;nbsp;°C appeared for Chopok at meteo.sk as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sme.sk/c/4018705/shmu-podozrieva-meteo-ze-opisuje.html SHMÚ suspicious that meteo.sk is stealing their data] News portal SME.sk (in Slovak)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Algemeen Nederlands Persbureau|ANP]] in the Netherlands once deliberately included a false story about a fire in their radio newscast to see if [[Radio Veronica]] takes its news from the ANP. Several hours later, Radio Veronica also aired the story.
* [[Google]], alleging its search results for a misspelling of [[tarsorrhaphy]] started appearing in [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]] results partway through the summer of 2010, created fabricated search results where a hundred query terms like "[[hiybbprqag]]", "delhipublicschool40 chdjob" and "juegosdeben1ogrande" each returned a link to a single unrelated webpage. Nine of the hundred fraudulent results planted by Google were later observed as the first result for the bogus term on Bing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pogue|first1=Glenn|title=On Google's Bing Sting|url=https://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/02/on-googles-bing-sting/?_r=0|work=The New York Times|date=February 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/technology/technology-news/google-accuses-microsoft-of-stealing-its-search-results-20110202-1acsl.html |title=Bing Copying Google?

== Scrutiny Checks ==
{{see also |List of scholarly publishing stings}}
Some publications such as those published by [[Harvard]] [[biologist]] [[John Bohannon]] are used to detect lack of [[replication crisis|academic scrutiny]], [[peer review | editorial oversight]], [[fraud]] and/or [[p hacking]] on the part of authors or their publishers.  Trap publications may be used by publishers to immediately reject articles citing them, or by academics to detect journals of ill repute (those that would publish them or works citing them).

== Humorous hoaxes ==

Fictitious entries often occur in reference publications as a prank, or [[practical joke]], in an attempt to be humorous, such as: 

* The [[German language|German-language]] ''[[Der neue Pauly]]. Enzyklopaedie der Antike'', edited by H. Cancik and H. Schneider, vol. 1 (Stuttgart, 1996, {{ISBN|3-476-01470-3}}) includes a fictitious entry now well known amongst classicists: a deadpan description of an entirely fictional [[Roman Empire|Roman]] sport, ''[[apopudobalia]]'', which resembles modern [[football (soccer)|association football]].
* ''[[Appletons' Cyclopædia of American Biography]]'' (1887–1889) contains about two hundred fictitious entries.
* ''[[Zzxjoanw]]'' was the last entry in Rupert Hughes’ ''Music Lovers’ Encyclopedia'' of 1903, and it continued as an entry in subsequent editions down to the 1950s. It was described as a [[Māori language|Māori]] word for a drum. Later, it was proved to be a [[hoax]] (having seemed suspect because Māori does not use the letters J, X or Z).
* The 1975 ''[[New Columbia Encyclopedia]]'' contains a fictitious entry on ''Lillian Virginia Mountweazel'' (1942–1973).&lt;ref name="mountweazel" /&gt; Her biography claims she was a fountain designer and [[photographer]], best known for ''Flags Up!'', a collection of photographs of rural American [[Letter box|mailboxes]]. Supposedly she was born in [[Bangs, Ohio]], and died in an explosion while on assignment for ''Combustibles'' magazine. Mountweazel was the subject of an exhibit in Dublin, Ireland, in March 2009 examining her fictitious life and works.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/theticket/2009/0320/1224243084358.html "The Life and Times of Lillian Virginia Mountweazel"], Aidan Dunne, ''[[The Irish Times]]'', March 20, 2009. Retrieved March 27 2009 {{Subscription or libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The first printing in 1980 of ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'' contains two fictitious entries: on Guglielmo Baldini, a non-existent Italian composer, and Dag Henrik Esrum-Hellerup, who purportedly composed a small amount of music for [[flute]]. Esrum-Hellerup's surname derives from a Danish village and a suburb in [[Copenhagen]]. The two entries were removed from later editions, as well as from later printings of the 1980 edition.
* The [[German language|German-language]] medical encyclopedia ''Pschyrembel Klinisches Wörterbuch'' features an entry on the ''Steinlaus'' ([[stone louse]]), a rock-eating animal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19225741.800-the-word-copyright-trap.html The word: Copyright trap] ''New Scientist'' October 21, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific name ''Petrophaga lorioti'' implies its origin: a creation of the German humorist [[Vicco von Bülow|Loriot]]. The ''Pschyrembel'' entry was removed in 1996 but, after reader protests, was restored the next year, with an extended section on the role of the stone louse in the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]].

=== Practical jokes ===
Fictitious entries occasionally feature in other publications in an attempt to be humorous, such as:

*[[Rhinogradentia]] are a fictitious [[mammal]]ian [[Order (biology)|order]], extensively documented in a series of articles and books by the equally fictitious [[Germany|German]] naturalist [[Harald Stümpke]]. Allegedly, both the animals and the scientist were the creations of [[Gerolf Steiner]], a [[zoology]] professor at the [[University of Heidelberg]].
*[[Taro Tsujimoto]] is a fictional character often included in [[Buffalo Sabres]] reference works. Tsujimoto, an alleged Japanese forward, was the creation of Sabres general manager [[Punch Imlach|George "Punch" Imlach]] designed to fool the [[National Hockey League]] during the [[1974 NHL Amateur Draft]]; Imlach drafted Tsujimoto and only months later—well after the pick was made official—admitted that the league had been fooled by the fictitious player.
*[[Franz Bibfeldt]] is a fictitious theologian created by Robert Howard Clausen for a footnote in a student paper. Bibfeldt was later popularized by Clausen's classmate [[Martin Marty]] as an ongoing in-joke among theologians, including a book and a parody lecture series at the University of Chicago Divinity School.
* At least two [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets|sports teams]] at [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] have long included [[George P. Burdell]], a fictitious student originally created as a practical joke by a Tech student in 1927, in their lists of [[Varsity letter|lettermen]] in team media guides:
**[[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Football]]: Lists Burdell as a letterman in the 1928, 1929, and 1930 seasons.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', {{cite web|url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/geot/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/2016-17/misc_non_event/info-guide-16.pdf |title=All-Time Letterwinners |work=Georgia Tech Football 2016 Media Guide |page=136 |publisher=Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets |accessdate=March 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**[[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets men's basketball|Men's basketball]]: Lists Burdell as a letterman in the 1955–56, 1956–57, and 1957–58 seasons.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', {{cite web|url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/geot/sports/m-baskbl/auto_pdf/2016-17/misc_non_event/gtmbb_info_guide_1617.pdf |title=Tech Letterwinners |work=Georgia Tech Basketball 2016–2017 Information Guide |page=82 |publisher=[[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets]] |accessdate=March 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Puzzles/games ===
Many publications have included false items and then challenged readers to identify it, including:
*[[Australia]]n [[palaeontology|palaeontologist]] [[Tim Flannery]]'s book ''[[Astonishing Animals]]'' includes one imaginary animal and leaves it up to the reader to distinguish which one it is.
*The product catalogue for Swedish consumer electronics and hobby articles retailer [[Teknikmagasinet]] contains a fictitious product. Finding that product is a contest, ''Blufftävlingen'', in which the best suggestion for another fictitious product from someone who spotted the product gets included in the next issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teknikmagasinet.se/nydb/db.pl?template_file=link_bluffen.html |title=Teknikmagasinet – meningen med livet |publisher=Teknik magasinet |language=sv |accessdate=April 23, 2014 |trans-title=Meaning of life |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080403100827/http://www.teknikmagasinet.se/nydb/db.pl?template_file=link_bluffen.html |archivedate=April 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Muse (children's magazine)|Muse]]'', a US magazine for children 10–14, regularly includes a two-page spread containing science and technology news. One of the news stories is false and readers are encouraged to guess which one.
*''[[Games (magazine)|Games]]'' (a magazine devoted to games and puzzles) used to include a fake advertisement in each issue as one of the magazine's regular games.
*The book ''[[The Golden Turkey Awards]]'' describes many bizarre and obscure films. The authors of the work state that one film described by the book is a complete hoax, and they challenge readers to spot the made-up film; the imaginary film was ''Dog of Norway'', which supposedly starred "Muki the Wonder Dog", named after the authors' own dog

== Fictitious entries in fiction ==
Fictitious entries are sometimes plot points in fiction, including:

* A [[Fred Saberhagen]] [[science fiction]] short story, "The Annihilation of Angkor Apeiron", in which an encyclopedia article for a star system is a fictitious entry included in the encyclopedia to detect plagiarism, which causes a [[Berserker (Saberhagen)|Berserker]] ship to end up in an empty star system where it runs out of fuel and ceases to be a threat to humanity.
* [[Jorge Luis Borges]]'s short story "[[Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius]]" tells of an encyclopedia entry on what turns out to be the imaginary country of Uqbar. This leads the narrator to the equally fantastic region of Tlön, the setting for much of the country's literature.
* The fictitious entry [[Agloe, New York]], is a key plot point in [[John Green (author)|John Green]]'s 2008 novel ''[[Paper Towns]]'' and its [[Paper Towns (film)|film adaptation]]. ''Paper Towns'' also references the fictitious entry "Lillian Mountweazel" in the name of the Spiegelman family's dog, Myrna Mountweazel.
* In the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode "[[Face the Raven]]", a hidden community lives in a London alley. [[Clara Oswald]] helps the Doctor start the search for that community by searching for any trap streets within the London city limits.

== Legal action ==
Fictitious entries may be used to demonstrate copying, but to prove legal infringement, the material must also be shown to be eligible for copyright. However, due to the [[Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service|''Feist v. Rural'']], [[Trivial Pursuit#Fred%20Worth%20lawsuit|Fred Worth lawsuit]] where the Supreme Court ruled that "information alone without a minimum of original creativity cannot be protected by copyright", there are very few cases where copyright has been proven. Many of these cases that go to court are dismissed and the affected party is rewarded no compensation.

* Fred L. Worth, author of ''[[The Trivia Encyclopedia]]'', filed a $300 million lawsuit against the distributors of [[Trivial Pursuit]]. He claimed that more than a quarter of the questions in the game's Genus Edition had been taken from his books, even his own fictitious entries that he had added to the books to catch anyone who wanted to violate his copyright. However, the case was thrown out by the district court judge as the Trivial Pursuit inventors argued that facts are not protected by copyright.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gOYKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=2U8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4598,4685968|title=The Courier - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com|access-date=2018-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ''Nester's Map &amp; Guide Corp. v. Hagstrom Map Co.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/796/729/1559434/|title=Nester's Map &amp; Guide Corp. v. Hagstrom Map Co., 796 F. Supp. 729 (E.D.N.Y. 1992)|work=Justia Law|access-date=2018-10-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; a New York Corporation that published and sold a New York City taxi driver's guide entitled ''Official New York Taxi Driver's Guide,'' attempted to sue Hagstrom Map Corporation who published and sold ''New York City Taxi &amp; Limousine Drivers Guide,'' that Hagstrom allegedly violated the [[Copyright Act of 1976]] for permanent injunction of their guide, damages, and attorney fees. However, this case was dismissed by the United States Federal Court because it found that fictitious entries (in this case, a "[[trap street]]") are not themselves protected by copyright.
* In ''Alexandria Drafting Co. v. Andrew H. Amsterdam dba Franklin Maps'', Alexandria Drafting Corporation filed suit against Franklin Maps alleging that Franklin Maps had violated the [[Copyright Act of 1976]] by copying their map books. However, this case was dismissed although the judge cited that there was a single instance of original copyright, but this was not sufficient evidence to support copyright infringement. Additionally the judge cited ''Nester's Map &amp; Guide Corp. v. Hagstrom Map Co.'' as previous case law to support that "fictitious names may not be copyrighted" and "the existence, or non-existence, of a road is a non-copyrightable fact."
* In one particular case, in 2001 [[The Automobile Association]] in the [[United Kingdom]] agreed to settle a case for £20,000,000 when it was caught copying [[Ordnance Survey]] maps. However, in this copyright infringement case there was no instance of a purposeful copyright trap. Instead, the prosecution sued for specific stylistic choices, such as the width and style of the roads. 

== Simple Errors ==
Often times there will be errors in maps, dictionaries, and other publications, that are not deliberate and thus are not fictitious entries. For example, within dictionaries there are such mistakes known as [[ghost words]], "words which have no real existence […] being mere coinages due to the blunders of printers or scribes, or to the perfervid imaginations of ignorant or blundering editors."&lt;ref&gt;W. W. Skeat, The Transactions of the Philological Society 1885-7 (Oxford: Blackwell, 1885-7) Vol. II, p.351.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Foreign body aspiration''' occurs when a foreign body enters the airways and causes [[choking]].&lt;ref name="urlForeign Body Aspiration: Overview - eMedicine"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/298940-overview |title=Foreign Body Aspiration: Overview - eMedicine |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objects can enter the esophagus through the mouth, or enter the trachea through the mouth or nose.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Current Diagnosis &amp; Treatment: Pediatrics, 24e, "Respiratory Tract &amp; Mediastinum"|last=Federico|first=Monica|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2018|isbn=1259862909|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Most cases of foreign body aspiration are in children ages 6 months to 3 years due to the tendency for children to place small objects in the mouth and nose. Children of this age usually lack molars and cannot grind up food into small pieces for proper swallowing.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Current Diagnosis &amp; Treatment: Surgery, 14e, "Otolaryngology: Head &amp; Neck Surgery"|last=Weinberger|first=Paul|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2015|isbn=9781259255168|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small, round objects including nuts, hard candy, popcorn kernels, beans, and berries are common causes of foreign body aspiration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Latex balloons are also a serious choking hazard in children that can result in death. A latex balloon will conform to the shape of the trachea, blocking the airway and making it difficult to expel with the [[Heimlich maneuver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Muntz|first=Harlan|title=Pediatric Otolaryngology for the Clinician: Foreign Body Management|year=2009|publisher=Humana Press|isbn=978-1-58829-542-2|pages=215–222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In adults, foreign body aspiration is most prevalent in populations with impaired swallowing mechanisms such as the following: neurological disorders, alcohol use, sedative use, advanced age (most common in the 6th decade of life), and loss of consciousness.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fishman's Pulmonary Diseases and Disorders, Fifth Edition, "Upper Airway Obstruction in Adults"|last=Won|first=Christine|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2015|isbn=0071807284|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Signs and Symptoms ==
[[File:Foreign body aspiration.jpg|thumb|foreign body aspiration]]
Signs and symptoms of foreign body aspiration vary based on the site of obstruction, the size of the foreign body, and the severity of obstruction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 20% of foreign bodies become lodged in the upper airway, while 80% become lodged in the mainstem or lobar bronchus.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Current Diagnosis &amp; Treatment: Emergency Medicine, 8e, "Respiratory Distress"|last=Lucia|first=Dominic|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2017|isbn=0071840613|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Signs of foreign body aspiration are usually abrupt in onset with coughing, choking, and/or wheezing; however, symptoms can be more progressive if the foreign body does not cause a large degree of obstruction of the airway.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Classically, patients present with acute onset of choking.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In these cases, the obstruction is classified as a partial or complete obstruction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Signs of partial obstruction include choking with drooling, stridor, and the ability to speak.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Signs of complete obstruction include choking with inability to speak or cough, and signs of respiratory distress such as cyanosis.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Foreign bodies above the larynx often present with stridor, while objects below the larynx present with wheezing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Foreign bodies above the vocal cords often present with difficulty and pain with swallowing and excessive drooling.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Foreign bodies below the vocal cords often present with pain and difficulty with speaking and breathing.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Increased respiratory rate may be the only sign of foreign body aspiration in a child who cannot verbalize or report if they have swallowed a foreign body.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

If the foreign body does not cause a large degree of obstruction, patients may present with chronic cough, asymmetrical breath sounds on exam, or recurrent pneumonia of a specific lung lobe.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The right lower lobe of the lung is the most common site of recurrent pneumonia in foreign body aspiration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is due to the fact that the anatomy of the right main bronchus is wider and steeper than that of the left main bronchus.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Signs and symptoms of foreign body aspiration in adults can sometimes mimic other lung disorders such as asthma, COPD, and lung cancer.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Current Medical Diagnosis &amp; Treatment, "Pulmonary Disorders"|last=Chesnutt|first=Asha|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2019|isbn=126011743X|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Diagnosis ==
If foreign body aspiration is suspected, finger sweeping in the oral cavity is not recommended due to the increased risk of displacing the foreign object further into the airway.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Most patients receive a chest x-ray to determine the location of the foreign body.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, a negative chest x-ray cannot rule out foreign body aspiration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Lateral neck, chest, and bilateral decubitus end-expiratory chest x-rays should be obtained in patients suspected of having aspirated a foreign body.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Signs on x-ray that can be indicative of foreign body aspiration include visualization of the foreign body or hyperinflation of the affected lung.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Other x-ray findings that can be seen with foreign body aspiration include obstructive emphysema, atelectasis, and consolidation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

While, x-ray can be used to visualize the location and identity of a foreign body, rigid bronchoscopy under general anesthesia is the gold-standard for diagnosis since the foreign body can be visualized and removed with this intervention.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Rigid bronchoscopy is indicated when two of the three following criteria are met: report of foreign body aspiration by the patient or a witness, abnormal lung exam findings, or abnormal chest x-ray findings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

== Treatment ==
Treatment of foreign body aspiration is determined by the severity of obstruction of the airway involved.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In partial obstruction, the patient can usually clear the foreign body with coughing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In complete obstruction, acute intervention is required to remove the foreign body.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For choking children less than 1 year of age, the child should be placed face down over the rescuer's arm.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Back blows should be delivered with the heel of the hand, then the patient should be turned face-up and chest thrusts should be administered.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The rescuer should alternate five back blows followed by five chest thrusts until the object is cleared.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Heimlich maneuver should be used in choking patients older than 1 year of age to dislodge a foreign body. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; If the patient becomes unresponsive during physical intervention, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) should be started.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the event that the above measures do not remove the foreign body, and adequate ventilation cannot be restored, need for treatment by trained personnel becomes necessary.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Laryngoscopy should be performed in unresponsive patients if non-invasive airway clearance techniques are unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Laryngoscopy involves placing a device in the mouth to visualize the back of the airway.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; If the foreign body can be seen, it can be removed with forceps.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; An endotracheal tube should then be placed in order to prevent airway compromise from resulting inflammation after the procedure.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; If the foreign body cannot be visualized, intubation, tracheostomy, or needle cricothyrotomy can be done to restore an airway for patients who have become unresponsive due to airway compromise.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

If non-invasive measures do not dislodge the foreign body, and the patient can maintain adequate ventilation, rigid bronchoscopy under general anesthesia should be performed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Supplemental oxygen, cardiac monitoring, and a pulse oximeter should be applied to the patient.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Efforts should be made to keep the patient calm and avoid agitating the patient to prevent further airway compromise.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; After the foreign body is removed, patients should receive nebulized beta-adrenergic medication and chest physiotherapy to further protect the airway.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Complications ==
Many complications can develop after a foreign body is removed, or if a foreign body remains in the airway.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Patients may develop inflammation of the airway walls or lung abscess from a foreign body remaining in the airway.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Hyperinflation of the airway distal to the obstruction can also occur if the foreign body is not removed.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Patients can also develop pneumonia from retained foreign bodies.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Episodes of recurrent pneumonia in the same lung field should prompt evaluation for a possible foreign body in the airway.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Even if the foreign body is removed, complications such as chemical bronchitis, mucosal reactions, and the development of granulation tissue are possible.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A '''geohazard''' is a geological state that may lead to widespread damage or risk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geohazards.no International Centre for Geohazards]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302114513/http://www.geohazards.no/ |date=March 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Geohazards are geological and environmental conditions and involve long-term or short-term geological processes. Geohazards can be relatively small features, but they can also attain huge dimensions (e.g., submarine or surface [[landslide]]) and affect local and regional socio-economy to a large extent (e.g., [[tsunami]]s).

==Geohazards==
{{See also|Natural hazard}}
Human activities, such as drilling through overpressured zones—could result in significant risk, and as such mitigation and prevention are paramount, through improved understanding of geohazards, their preconditions, causes and implications. In other cases, particularly in montane regions, natural processes can cause catalytic events of a complex nature, such as an [[avalanche]] hitting a lake causes a debris flow, with consequences potentially hundreds of miles away, or creating a [[lahar]] by volcanism.

The continued and multi-disciplinary investigation into the occurrence and implications of geohazards, in particular offshore geohazards in relation with the oil and gas exploration, lead to specific mitigation studies and establishing relevant prevention mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nadim | year = 2006 | title = Challenges to geo-scientists in risk assessment for sub-marine slides | url = | journal = Norwegian Journal of Geology | volume = 86 | issue = 3| pages = 351–362 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Solheim | first1 = A.| year = | title = , 2005.

== History ==

GigMasters was founded in 1997 by New York area entrepreneurs Michael Caldwell and Kevin Kinyon. In February of that year, the company launched the first version of its website. In September 2010, GigMasters raised $200,000 in expansion funding from investor James Marciano.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

In 2013, about half of the company's booking were wedding-related.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reviewjournal.com/business/fading-glory-demand-elvis-impersonators-isnt-what-it-used-be "Fading glory: Demand for Elvis impersonators isn't what it used to be"].

'''Global Wind Day''' is a [[international observance|worldwide event]] that occurs annually on [[15 June]].  It is organised by EWEA ([[European Wind Energy Association]]) and GWEC ([[Global Wind Energy Council]]).
&lt;ref&gt;[http://campaign.r20.constantcontact.com/render?m=1102949362881&amp;ca=e882c25a-f468-49fe-b235-801f5a25f67a GWEC Media Release: The local impact of wind energy in the spotlight on Global Wind Day]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a day when [[wind power|wind energy]] is celebrated, information is exchanged and adults and children find out about wind energy, its power and the possibilities it holds to change the world. 
In association with EWEA and GWEC, national wind energy associations and companies involved in wind energy production organise events in many countries around the world. In 2011, there were events organised in 30 countries, on 4 continents. Events included visits to onshore and offshore wind farms, information campaigns, demonstration turbines being set up in cities, wind workshops and a wind parade. Many events happened on Global Wind Day (15 June) itself, but there were also events on the days and weeks before and afterwards. In 2012 there were 250 events around the globe and a very popular photo competition.

{{TOC limit|limit=3}}

==2007==
The inaugural year of Wind Day (it did not become Global Wind Day until 2009) was organised by EWEA. The main idea was to coordinate events organised by national wind energy associations and companies active in the wind energy field. Wind Day in 2007 reached 18 countries in Europe, with a participation of around 35,000 people.

==2008==
Wind Day 2008 reached 20 European countries and attracted 100,000 people.

==2009==
This was the first year that EWEA joined forces with GWEC and extended the reach from European wind energy associations and companies to coordinate Wind Day events across the globe (and changing the name to Global Wind Day). In 2009 there were 300 events in 35 countries, reaching 1 million people.

In 2009 in Portugal the Wind Day was celebrated with an event called Wind Parade. It was organised in the city of Cascais just in front of the ocean. This project aimed to promote renewable energy good practices and in particular Wind Energy. It was supported by the City Council and conceived by Energia Lateral and implied the installation of 7 skstream micro wind turbines in a very visible place by the sea in June–July 9. One of the purposes was to involve children in the event and they were invited for a contest to decorate/paint small dummy wind turbines. Over 50 applications were submitted by 30 schools. The winner decorated a dummy wind turbine with Don Quixote elements comparing his fight against the windmills but in this case the wind mills being allies of Don Quixote in an epic effort to improve the environment.

==2010==
In this year, 220 events took place in 30 countries, including the display of a 29.5 metre (96.7&amp;nbsp;ft) wind turbine blade in Brussels, Belgium, next to the main building of the [[European Commission]] and [[European Council]]. More than 1 million people were reached by Global Wind Day communications around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/topics/m/video/56693102/global-wind-day-2010.htm|title=Global Wind Day 2010|date=2010-06-15|publisher=renewableenergyworld.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2011==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Global Wind Day Wind Parade.jpg|thumb|Global Wind Day Wind Parade, Brussels 2011]] --&gt;

In [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]], the home of EWEA and GWEC, a wind parade in [[Place de Luxembourg]] educated people working in the [[European Union|EU]] area on the benefits and importance of wind energy.

Global Wind Day events happened in 30 countries around the world in 2011. Some examples include:
In [[France]] there were 15 events, ranging from wind farm inauguration to a jobs-in-the-wind-industry question and answer session. 
In [[Austria]], journalists leapt from the top of a turbine and abseiled to the ground. 
In [[Japan]] there were 10 events, involving field trips to wind farms, experimental wind energy facilities and making wind turbines from a kit. 
In [[Australia]], an open day at a wind farm was available, with a community evening to finish off the day. 
In [[Mexico]], a public street fair featured a drawing competition for kids and a display of wind energy history.

==2012==

Global Wind Day partners organised 250 events around the globe in 2012, from wind farm open days to workshops, from
photo exhibition to regattas, from kite-flying to charity runs. For the first time, this included events in
[[Mexico]], [[Chile]], [[Israel]], [[South Korea]] and [[South Africa]].
Global Wind Day 2012 gained the support of 18 GWD Ambassadors,who were joined by the Danish Presidency of the EU and the United Nations. Kandeh K. Yumkella, the Director-General of the [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]] (UNIDO), and the leader of Secretary General Ban Ki-moon’s Sustainable Energy for All initiative said, ‘We need to double the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix by 2030. This can be achieved with significant contribution from wind energy, both grid connected andfor small-scale decentralised systems. The ‘Global Wind Day’ on 15 June, does play a central role in contributing to the UNSG’s Sustainable Energy For All initiative through galvanising the much needed support for the wind energy industry from political leaders around the globe’.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalwindday.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/GWD_report_2012.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
The ‘Wind in Mind’ photo competition saw 2,300 photos from over 40 countries submitted.

==2018==
For 2018, WindEurope and GWEC launched a global photo competition to capture the power of wind in the run up to Global Wind Day.&lt;ref&gt;[https://globalwindday.org/photo-competition/ Global Wind Day Photo Competition “Wind Vision” 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://globalwindday.org/wind-vision-photo-competition-winners/ Wind Vision Photo Competition Winners (in all 3 categories)]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3603">'''Global news flow''' (also referred to as '''international news flow''') is a field of study that deals with the news coverage of events in foreign countries. It describes and explains the flow of news from one country to another.&lt;ref name="segev"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.peterlang.com/view/product/31394|title=International News Online: Global Views with Local Perspectives|last=Segev|first=Elad|publisher=Peter Lang|year=2016|isbn=9781433129841|location=New York|page=139-153|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies on global news flow typically attempt to understand why certain countries are more newsworthy than others..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kariel|first1=Herbert G.|last2=Rosenvall|first2=Lynn A.|title=Factors influencing international news flow|journal=Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly|date=1984|volume=61|issue=3|page=509-516|doi=10.1177/107769908406100305}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kim, K., &amp; Barnett, G. A. (1996). The determinants of international news flow a network analysis. Communication Research, 23(3), 323-352.&lt;/ref&gt; Along the years it has been found that the economic power of countries plays a particularly crucial role in their news prominence&lt;ref name="segev_blondheim"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Segev|first1=Elad|last2=Blondheim|first2=Menahem|title=America's global standing according to popular news sites from around the world|journal=Political Communication|date=2013|volume=30|issue=1|page=139-161|doi=10.1080/10584609.2012.737418|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10584609.2012.737418|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the presence of international news agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, H. D. (2000). Systemic determinants of international news coverage: A comparison of 38 countries. Journal of Communication, 50(2), 110-130.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the US has been found to be very prominent in news mentions around the world (18%), followed by China, Western European and Middle Eastern countries (about 3-5% each).&lt;ref name="segev" /&gt;

The unequal representation of the world and the under-representation of [[developing countries]] have been already of a great concern at least since the 1950s, since they influence the way people perceive the world and the image of countries.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO (1954). How Nations See Each Other? Paris: UNESCO Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; This problem was later addressed in the [[MacBride report]], and his set of recommendations for a [[New World Information and Communication Order]]. The unequal representation of the world has been also linked to the [[World System Theory]], and the unequal economic structure of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Chang, T. K. (1998). All Countries Not Created Equal to Be News World System and International Communication. Communication research, 25(5), 528-563.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent empirical studies&lt;ref name="segev_blondheim" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Segev|first=Elad|title=Visible and invisible countries: News flow theory revised|journal=Journalism|date=2015|volume=16|issue=3|page=412-428|doi=10.1177/1464884914521579|url=http://jou.sagepub.com/content/16/3/412|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; show that among online news websites and [[news aggregators]] the unequal representation of the world has been perpetuated and even further intensified. Economically powerful countries, as well as their opponent countries (mainly in the Middle East and Asia) get the most news coverage around the world.

[http://www.accmuseum.org/Patencio-Road Aqua Caliente Cultural Museum: Francisco Patencio]&lt;/ref&gt;) In December 1944, Secretary of the Interior [[Oscar L.

==Conservatorship program==

===Odlum Report===
In January 1953, [[Douglas McKay]] became [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]]. Thereafter McKay asked industrialist [[Floyd B. Odlum]] (former president of Atlas Corp. and husband of [[Jacqueline Cochran]]) to investigate the affairs of the Agua Caliente Indians.&lt;ref name="GoldenCheckerboard" /&gt;{{RP|124}} The report by Odlum's committee was completed in April 1955 and put into final form in April 1956. Among other things, Odlum's report determined: that the Band consisted of 83 persons, the majority of whom were minors; the value of the Indian land, allotted and unallotted, totaled as much as $12,000,000; and the value of the land could increase with proper development. Odlum also discussed the legal problems related to unequal allotments, taxes on non-productive real estate, the inability to lease land because of a 5-year limit, and conflicting claims of the allottees.&lt;ref name="GoldenCheckerboard" /&gt;{{RP|127–8}} The report recommended that the Indian land be placed in a private corporation or trusteeship rather than existing wardship.&lt;ref name="GoldenCheckerboard" /&gt;{{RP|129–30}} Odlum's recommendations were not implemented because newly elected Congressman [[Dalip Singh Saund]], who ran against Cochran in a bitter election campaign, blocked proposed legislation.&lt;ref name="GoldenCheckerboard" /&gt;{{RP|132}} In the meantime, Congress passed Public Law No. 255 in August 1955, which allowed for leases of 50 years.&lt;ref name="GoldenCheckerboard" /&gt;{{RP|138}}

===1959 legislation===&lt;!--subject to more editing. McCabe's papers (which are referenced below) are not readily available. Ainsworth's book is poorly organized, lacking an index or TOC. The "landmark decision" is probably related to the Equalization Act.--&gt;
In 1959, a landmark decision by the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] equalized allotted Indian lands, thereby setting the stage for development of Indian lands within the city of Palm Springs. This same legislation, however, recognizing the potential value of Indian lands within the boundaries of a world-famous resort, also called for the appointment of conservators and guardians to "protect" Indians and their estates from "artful and designing persons"&lt;ref name="LandProblems"&gt;[http://www.usc.edu/libraries/finding_aids/records/finding_aid.php?fa=0018 USC Libraries; Archival Collections: Judge Hilton McCabe Collection on the Agua Caliente Indians] containing unpublished manuscript of ''Land Problems and Solutions of the Agua Caliente Band of Mission Indians'' (1961), Hilton McCabe, Indio Superior Court.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laassubject.org/index.php/directory/profile/usc_dml_rare_books_and_manuscripts USC Doheny Memorial Library: Rare Books and Manuscripts]&lt;/ref&gt; who might otherwise cheat them out of their properties, which could now be legally sold by the individual tribal members who owned them. By declaring Indians as "incompetent" (both as children and adults) court-appointed conservators and guardians took control of a majority of Indian estates. A major oversight of the program was the appointment of judges, lawyers, and business people as Indian conservators and guardians—the very people the program sought to protect Indians and their estates from. The program was administered by the Indio Superior Court's Judge Hilton McCabe, subject of ''Golden Checkerboard''. McCabe concurrently acted as a conservator to a number of tribal members and an [[executor]], in addition to his administrative and legal roles.&lt;ref name="CoxReport"&gt;{{cite book|title=Report on the Administration of Guardianships and Conservatorships Established for Members of the Agua Caliente Band of Mission Indians, California|date=March 1968|publisher=Department of the Interior|location=Washington, DC|pages=56|url=|author=Palm Springs Task Force (Cox Report)|oclc=8536472}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;As a result of the conservatorship program the Band was able to lease land to businesses. The Spa Hotel opened in November 1962, with Eileen Miguel, head of the Band, U.S. Grant IV, great-grandson of President Grant, and McCabe at the opening ceremony. In 1961, 41 members of the Band signed a petition to McCabe thanking him for his efforts. {{Cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5810">The term '''international crisis''' is widespread term without a single common definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Acuto|first=Michele|title=Diplomats in Crisis|journal=Diplomacy &amp; Statecraft|date=7 September 2011|volume=online|doi=10.1080/09592296.2011.599661|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09592296.2011.599661|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   To some, it involves "a sequence of interactions between the governments of two or more sovereign states in severe conflict, short of actual war, but involving the perception of a dangerously high probability of [[war]]".&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Glenn H. and Diesing, Paul: 1977. Conflict Among Nations: Bargaining, Decision Making and System Structure in International Crises. defines an international crisis&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Lebow gives a breakdown of three types of international crises:
* '''Justification of Hostilities'''.&lt;ref&gt;Lebow, Richard N.:1981. Between Peace and War: The Nature of International Crisis.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the nations decides, before the crisis starts, to go to [[war]] and constructs a crisis to justify it. The pattern of justification is almost always the same: Rouse public opinion, make impossible demands, try to legitimize the demands, deny your real intentions then employ the rejection of the demands as a reason for war. A recent example, commonly employed by [[Public image of George W. Bush|critics of George W. Bush]], is the [[Iraq disarmament crisis]], which precipitated the [[Iraq War]].
* '''Spinoff Crisis'''. The nations are involved in a war or crisis with another nation or nations and this precipitates another crisis, e.g. the [[RMS Lusitania|Lusitania]] incident in 1915.
* '''Brinkmanship'''. Intentionally forcing a crisis to get the other side to back down. The [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] of 1962 is a well-known example of [[brinkmanship]].

With the exception of a justification of hostilities, the study of international crises assumes that neither side actually wants to go to war, but must be visibly prepared to do so. In the words of [[Groucho Marx]], "Always be sincere, even if you don't mean it".

==Strategies==
George's book presents an overview of the process and conflicting goals of [[crisis management]] as well as many examples.&lt;ref&gt;George, Alexander L (ed): 1991. Avoiding War: Problems of Crisis Management.&lt;/ref&gt; He discusses a number of strategies, including:

===Offensive strategies===
*[[blackmail]]
*limited and reversible response
*controlled pressure
*[[attrition warfare|attrition]]
*[[fait accompli]]

===Defensive strategies===
*[[coercion]]
*limited [[conflict escalation|escalation]]
*[[tit-for-tat]]
*test of capabilities
*"drawing a line"
* Buying time strategy
* Conveying commitment and resolve to avoid miscalculation by the adversary

==List of defused crises==
International crises tend to result in war, almost by definition; they are then remembered best not as crises but as [[Casus belli|causes of wars]]. For information on international crises that resulted immediately in war, see [[List of wars]].
&lt;!-- 2008 South Ossetia war (C[ommonly]K[nown]A[s] Russo-Georgian war) belongs to aforementioned [[list of wars]] (or, more precisely, to [[List of wars 2003–10]]) rather than to "ongoing crises" below --&gt;
Given the above, some of the crises that are best-known ''as crises'' were defused. The following crises did not immediately provoke large-scale violence, but set of anger in countries:

* [[War in sight crisis]] (1875)
* [[Anglo-Portuguese Crisis]] (1889–1890)

'''''Kalimantaan''''' is a novel by [[C. S. Godshalk]] offering a fictionalized account of the exploits of [[James Brooke]] in [[Sarawak]] in [[Borneo]].

==Plot introduction==
The novel uses of a variety of writing forms, including [[diary]] entries, [[Letter (message)|letter]]s, and straight [[Literary technique|narrative]] to tell its story. The author intentionally makes it difficult to determine what "really" happens in the story from dreams and fantasies of the characters.

==Plot summary==
In 1839, an English adventurer arrived on the northwest coast of [[Borneo]], commissioned to deliver a letter of gratitude to the [[Sultan of Brunei]] for having safely returned the crew of a British [[cargo ship|merchantman]], lost on his coast. It was a region full of [[headhunting|headhunter]]s, [[pirate]] tribes, and [[slave trade]]rs. Most Europeans with the temerity to enter the region had never been heard from again. This particular adventurer, however, seems to know how to play one power against another and manages to keep his balance in the midst of chaos. After performing a service for the Sultan (resolving a local tribal conflict through the use of his schooner's guns and leading an organized assault on a small native river fort), he is named governor of Sarawak, subject to the Sultan of Brunei. Within a few years, he has become the Rajah of Sarawak, an independent state, and established a dynasty that will last one hundred years.

Godshalk has changed names and details while evoking a sense of the time, place, and atmosphere of the real events. The real adventurer was [[James Brooke]]; Ms. Godshalk's is named Gideon Barr. James Brooke's schooner was named the ''Royalist''; Gideon Barr's is the ''Carolina'' (named after his mother). James Brooke was succeeded by his nephew, [[Charles Anthoni Johnson Brooke|Charles Johnson]], who took the last name Brooke. Gideon Barr is succeeded by his nephew Richard Hogg (Ms. Godshalk does not deal with the change of last name since her story focuses on Gideon's life and ends with his death).

Although many of the events described actually took place, one cannot simply change the names and read the novel as history. James Brooke's mother died in 1844, two years after he became Rajah. Gideon's mother dies in Borneo much earlier while he is in grade school in England, providing him an emotional link to Borneo James Brooke did not have. James Brooke never married a European, although there is evidence that he was married to a Malay woman. Gideon Barr marries an Englishwoman to provide himself an "air of permanence" as Rajah and we see much of the later portion of the story through Amelia Barr's eyes. Amelia Barr is fictional, but largely based on [[Margaret Brooke]], wife of the second Rajah, and her book "My Life in Sarawak". Gideon also maintains a Malayan mistress who provides a note of tragedy in the way her presence poisons Gideon and Amelia's relationship.

On the other hand, the 30,000 pounds that Brooke/Barr inherited at his father's death which enabled him to acquire his schooner, the massacre of the sons of the Sultan of Brunei, the Chinese insurrection of 1857, and the commission of inquiry in Singapore all took place as described. The inquiry in Singapore was concerned with the battle of Labuan in which Brooke/Barr led British warships in a pre-emptive strike against a pirate fleet, breaking the power of the Bugis for the next twenty years. Brooke/Barr's enemies attempted to use this against him by claiming he had used British naval power to slaughter innocent natives.

Godshalk uses [[Malay language|Malay]] words extensively in the book. While she provides a brief Malay glossary as an appendix, it does not cover all the words she uses. Enjoyment of ''Kalimantaan'' will be enhanced if one knows the following Malay words which are not in the glossary provided by the author:

'''Leander William Tomarkin''' (13 December 1895 – 1967) was a Swiss [[impostor]] who claimed to possess a doctorate in medicine, as well as to have invented a miracle medicine for the cure of [[typhus]], [[tuberculosis]], [[meningitis]], and [[malaria]]. He ascended to become the personal physician of [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Victor Emmanuel]], king of Italy, and he convinced [[Albert Einstein]] to become patron of a conference organised by him.

==Early life==

Leander Tomarkin was born on 13 December 1895 in [[Zollikon]], Switzerland. A doctor's son, he was the black sheep of the family, obtaining bad results at school and dropping a chemistry degree at college. He also soon developed a reputation of dishonesty. He did not take up regular employment but spent his time in his father's laboratory, hoping to invent something.&lt;ref name="Dreist"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://einestages.spiegel.de/s/tb/29653/hochstapler-leander-tomarkin-der-erfinder-des-antimicrobum.html|title=Doktor Dreist|trans-title=Doctor Brazen|last=von Lüpke|first=Marc|date=1 November 2013|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tomarkin rose to fame when he offered to cure [[Pope Benedict XV]]{{'s}} [[pneumonia]] in January 1922. The Pope died without Tomarkin being allowed to treat him but reporters subsequently picked up the story and enabled the progress of Tomarkin's medical career with publicising his ''Antimicrobum tomarkin'' medicine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|work=[[The Harvard Crimson]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose active ingredient he named ''Aminoortobenzoilsulfoisoamiloidrocupronucleinforminsodico''.&lt;ref name="Dreist"/&gt; The Antimicrobum was to reduce pneumonia mortality from about one third to 2%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|accessdate=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tomarkin was allowed to treat a cousin of [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy]], and the cousin recovered. As a result the king named Tomarkin the personal physician of the family. A clinical test at the [[Santo Spirito, Rome|Santo Spirito]] hospital in Rome was also successful, later attributed to the better care for test patient and the relatively early stage of pneumonia that the patients were in.&lt;ref name="Dreist"/&gt;

==Tomarkin-Foundation Chemistry Research==

In May 1924 Tomarkin emigrated to the United States, and three years later founded Tomarkin-Foundation Chemistry Research. At this research centre he developed ''Catalysan'' and ''Disulphamin'', claiming that these medicines bring about mood changes and treat sickness in that way. The Tomarkin Foundation soon spread to Europe. Its dependency in [[Locarno]] started to organise conferences between 1930 and 1938. These conferences were set beautifully and had rich side programs and thus attracted prominent people such as surgeon [[Ferdinand Sauerbruch]]. In 1931 [[Albert Einstein]] assumed the honorary presidency of the conference. Einstein only stayed in that position for one year, after a former landlady of Tomarkin contacted him to help retrieve debts.&lt;ref name="Dreist"/&gt;

At the onset of [[World War II]] Tomarkin again emigrated to the US, due to his [[Jew]]ish ancestry. With the development of industrially manufactured [[antibiotics]] in 1939 his medical invention became obsolete. He ventured into other areas, trying to invent waterproof paint and [[synthetic diamond]]s but was unsuccessful with both. Tomarkin died in 1967.&lt;ref name="Dreist"/&gt;

A '''leap year''' (also known as an '''intercalary year''' or '''bissextile year''') is a [[calendar year]] containing one additional day (or, in the case of [[lunisolar calendar]]s, a month) added to keep the calendar year synchronized with the [[astronomical year|astronomical]] or [[seasonal year]].&lt;ref name="Meeus"&gt;{{citation|last1 = Meeus | first1=Jean | date = 1998 | title = Astronomical Algorithims | publisher = Willmann-Bell | page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because seasons and astronomical events do not repeat in a [[Natural number|whole number]] of days, calendars that have the same number of days in each year drift over time with respect to the event that the year is supposed to track. By inserting (also called ''[[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalating]]'') an additional day or month into the year, the drift can be corrected. A year that is not a leap year is called a common year.

For example, in the [[Gregorian calendar]], each leap year has 366 days instead of 365, by [[February 29|extending February to 29 days]] rather than the common 28. These extra days occur in years which are multiples of four (with the exception of centennial years not divisible by 400). Similarly, in the lunisolar [[Hebrew calendar]], [[Adar 1|Adar Aleph]], a 13th lunar month, is added seven times every 19 years to the twelve lunar months in its common years to keep its calendar year from drifting through the seasons. In the [[Bahá'í Calendar]], a leap day is added when needed to ensure that the following year begins on the [[vernal equinox]].

The name "leap year" probably comes from the fact that while a fixed date in the Gregorian calendar normally advances one day of the week from one year to the next, the day of the week in the 12 months following the leap day (from March 1 through February 28 of the following year) will advance two days due to the extra day (thus "leaping over" one of the days in the week).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=Douglas | last=Harper | url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=leap+year&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 | title = leap year | work = Online Etymology Dictionary | date = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/leap-year|title=leap year - Definition of leap year in US English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English | accessdate = June 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Christmas Day]] (December 25) fell on a Sunday in 2016, and Monday in 2017, then it will fall on Tuesday in 2018, and Wednesday in 2019 but then "leaps" over Thursday to fall on a Friday in 2020.

The length of a day is also occasionally changed by the insertion of [[leap second]]s into [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC), owing to the variability of Earth's rotational period. Unlike leap days, leap seconds are not introduced on a regular schedule, since the variability in the length of the day is not entirely predictable.

==Gregorian calendar==
{{See also|Gregorian calendar}}
[[File:Leap Centuries.jpg|thumb|right|An image showing which century years are leap years in the Gregorian calendar.]]
In the Gregorian calendar, the standard calendar in most of the world, most years that are multiples of 4 are leap years. In each leap year, the month of February has 29 days instead of 28. Adding one extra day in the calendar every four years compensates for the fact that a period of 365 days is shorter than a [[tropical year]] by almost 6 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first1=Ed. K. Lee |last1=Lerner |first2=Brenda W. |last2=Lerner |title=Calendar |encyclopedia=The Gale Encyclopedia of Science |year=2004 |publisher=[[Gale]] |location=Detroit, MI |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some exceptions to this basic rule are required since the duration of a tropical year is slightly less than 365.25 days. The [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian reform]] modified the Julian calendar's scheme of leap years as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Every year that is exactly divisible by four is a leap year, except for years that are exactly divisible by 100, but these centurial years are leap years if they are exactly divisible by 400. For example, the years 1700, 1800, and 1900 were not leap years, but the years 1600 and 2000 were.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/calendars.php Introduction to Calendars]. (15 May 2013). [[United States Naval Observatory]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Over a period of four centuries, the accumulated error of adding a leap day ''every'' four years amounts to about three extra days. The Gregorian calendar therefore drops three leap days every 400 years, which is the length of its ''leap cycle''. This is done by dropping February 29 in the three century years (multiples of 100) that cannot be exactly divided by 400.&lt;ref name="usno"&gt;{{citation | author = United States Naval Observatory | authorlink = United States Naval Observatory | date = June 14, 2011 | url = http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/leap_years.php | title = Leap Years}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Lerner|Lerner|2004|p=681}} The years 1600, 2000 and 2400 are leap years, while 1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200 and 2300 are common years. By this rule, the average number of days per year is 365&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{{frac|4}}&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;{{frac|100}}&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{{frac|400}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;365.2425.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{citation | last = Richards | first = E.

The Gregorian calendar was designed to keep the [[vernal equinox]] on or close to March 21, so that the date of [[Easter]] (celebrated on the Sunday after the ecclesiastical [[full moon]] that falls on or after March 21) remains close to the vernal equinox.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = E. G. | last = Richards | date = 1998 | title = Mapping time: The Calendar and its History | publisher = Oxford University Press | pages = 250–1 | isbn = 0-19-286205-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The "[[Gregorian calendar#Accuracy|Accuracy]]" section of the "[[Gregorian calendar]]" article discusses how well the Gregorian calendar achieves this design goal, and how well it approximates the [[tropical year]].

===Algorithm===
&lt;!-- PLEASE DISCUSS ALGORITHM ON TALK PAGE BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGES --&gt;

The following [[pseudocode]] determines whether a year is a ''leap year'' or a ''common year'' in the Gregorian calendar (and in the proleptic Gregorian calendar before 1582). The ''year'' variable being tested is the integer representing the number of the year in the Gregorian calendar, and the tests are arranged to dispatch the most common cases first. Care should be taken in translating mathematical integer divisibility into specific programming languages.

'''if''' (''year'' is not [[divisor|divisible]] by 4) '''then''' (it is a common year)&lt;br&gt;
'''else if''' (''year'' is not divisible by 100) '''then''' (it is a leap year)&lt;br&gt;
'''else if''' (''year'' is not divisible by 400) '''then''' (it is a common year)&lt;br&gt;
'''else''' (it is a leap year)

The algorithm applies to proleptic Gregorian calendar years before 1, but only if the year is expressed with [[astronomical year numbering]]. It is not valid for the BC or BCE notation. The algorithm is not necessarily valid for years in the Julian calendar, such as years before 1752 in the British Empire.  The year 1700 was a leap year in the Julian calendar, but not in the Gregorian calendar.

===Leap day===
{{Main|February 29}}
[[File:Calendar-leapyeardate.jpg|thumb|right|A Swedish pocket calendar from 2008 showing February 29]]
[[File:Japanese Calendar with Verses by Osman Edwards 1900 February.jpg|thumb|February 1900 calendar showing that 1900 was not a leap year]]

February 29 is a date that usually occurs every four years, and is called leap day. This day is added to the calendar in leap years as a corrective measure, because the Earth does not orbit the sun in precisely 365 days.

The Gregorian calendar is a modification of the [[Julian calendar]] first used by the Romans. The [[Roman calendar]] originated as a lunisolar calendar and named many of its days after the [[Syzygy (astronomy)|syzygies]] of the moon: the new moon (''Kalendae'' or calends, hence "calendar") and the full moon (''Idus'' or ides). The ''Nonae'' or nones was not the first [[Lunar phase|quarter moon]] but was exactly one ''nundina'' or Roman market week of nine days before the ides, inclusively counting the ides as the first of those nine days. This is what we would call a period of eight days. In 1825, [[Christian Ludwig Ideler|Ideler]] believed that the lunisolar calendar was abandoned about 450 BC by the [[decemvirs]], who implemented the [[Roman calendar|Roman Republican calendar]], used until 46 BC. The days of these calendars were counted down (inclusively) to the next named day, so February 24 was ''ante diem sextum Kalendas Martias'' ("the sixth day before the calends of March") often abbreviated a. d. VI Kal. Mart. [[Ancient Rome|The Romans]] counted days inclusively in their calendars, so this was actually the fifth day before March 1 when counted in the modern exclusive manner (not including the starting day).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Thomas Hewitt | last = Key | url = http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Calendarium.html | title = Calendarium | publisher = University of Chicago | orig-year = 1875 | date = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Republican calendar's intercalary month was inserted on the first or second day after the [[Terminus (mythology)|Terminalia]] (a. d. VII Kal. Mar., February 23). The remaining days of Februarius were dropped. This intercalary month, named Intercalaris or [[Mercedonius]], contained 27 days. The religious festivals that were normally celebrated in the last five days of February were moved to the last five days of Intercalaris. Because only 22 or 23 days were effectively added, not a full lunation, the calends and ides of the Roman Republican calendar were no longer associated with the new moon and full moon.

The Julian calendar, which was developed in 46 BC by [[Julius Caesar]], and became effective in 45 BC, distributed an extra ten days among the months of the Roman Republican calendar. Caesar also replaced the intercalary month by a single intercalary day, located where the intercalary month used to be. To create the intercalary day, the existing ''ante diem sextum Kalendas Martias'' (February 24) was doubled, producing ''ante diem bis sextum Kalendas Martias''. Hence, the year containing the doubled day was a bissextile (''bis sextum'', "twice sixth") year. For legal purposes, the two days of the ''bis sextum'' were considered to be a single day, with the second half being intercalated; but in common practice by 238, when [[Censorinus]] wrote, the intercalary day was followed by the last five days of February, a. d. VI, V, IV, III and pridie Kal. Mart. (the days numbered 24, 25, 26, 27, and 28 from the beginning of February in a common year), so that the intercalated day was the ''first'' half of the doubled day. Thus the intercalated day was effectively inserted between the 23rd and 24th days of February. All later writers, including [[Macrobius]] about 430, [[Bede]] in 725, and other medieval [[computus|computists]] (calculators of Easter), continued to state that the bissextum (bissextile day) occurred before the last five days of February.

[[File:MissaleLeapYear.jpg|thumb|right|In the older [[Roman Missal]], feast days falling on or after February 24 are celebrated one day later in leap year.]]
Until 1970, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] always celebrated the feast of [[Saint Matthias]] on a. d. VI Kal. Mart., so if the days were numbered from the beginning of the month, it was named February 24 in common years, but the presence of the bissextum in a bissextile year immediately before a. d. VI Kal. Mart. shifted the latter day to February 25 in leap years, with the [[Vigil]] of St. Matthias shifting from February 23 to the leap day of February 24. This shift did not take place in pre-Reformation Norway and Iceland; [[Pope Alexander III]] ruled that either practice was lawful ([[Liber Extra]], 5. 40. 14. 1). Other feasts normally falling on February 25–28 in common years are also shifted to the following day in a leap year (although they would be on the same day according to the Roman notation). The practice is still observed by those who use the older calendars.

=== Synchronized calendars (Bengali, Indian and Thai) ===
The Revised [[Bengali Calendar]] of Bangladesh and the [[Indian National Calendar]] organise their leap years so that the every leap day is close to a February 29 in the Gregorian calendar and vice versa. This makes it easy to convert dates to or from Gregorian.

The [[Thai solar calendar]] uses the [[Buddhist Era]] (BE), but has been synchronized with the Gregorian since [[AD]] 1941.

==Julian, Coptic and Ethiopian calendars==
From AD 8 the Julian calendar received an extra day added to February in years that are multiples of 4.

The [[Coptic calendar]] and [[Ethiopian calendar]] also add an extra day to the end of the year once every four years before a Julian 29-day February.

This rule gives an average year length of 365.25 days. However, it is 11 minutes longer than a tropical year. This means that the vernal equinox moves a day earlier in the calendar about every 131 years.

==Revised Julian calendar==
The [[Revised Julian calendar]] adds an extra day to February in years that are multiples of four, except for years that are multiples of 100 that do not leave a remainder of 200 or 600 when divided by 900. This rule agrees with the rule for the Gregorian calendar until 2799. The first year that dates in the Revised Julian calendar will not agree with those in the Gregorian calendar will be 2800, because it will be a leap year in the Gregorian calendar but not in the Revised Julian calendar.

This rule gives an average year length of 365.242222 days. This is a very good approximation to the ''mean'' tropical year, but because the ''vernal equinox'' year is slightly longer, the Revised Julian calendar for the time being does not do as good a job as the Gregorian calendar at keeping the vernal equinox on or close to March 21.

==Chinese calendar==
The [[Chinese calendar]] is [[lunisolar calendar|lunisolar]], so a leap year has an extra month, often called an ''embolismic'' month after the Greek word for it. In the Chinese calendar the [[leap month]] is added according to a rule which ensures that month 11 is always the month that contains the northern winter [[solstice]]. The intercalary month takes the same number as the preceding month; for example, if it follows the second month (二月) then it is simply called "leap second month" i.e. {{zh|t=閏二月|s=闰二月|p=rùn'èryuè}}.

==Hebrew calendar==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Jewish holiday]] --&gt;
The Hebrew calendar is lunisolar with an [[embolismic month]]. This extra month is called ''Adar Alef'' ([[Adar 1|first Adar]]) and is added before ''[[Adar]]'', which then becomes ''Adar Bet'' ([[Adar 2|second Adar]]). According to the [[Metonic cycle]], this is done seven times every nineteen years (specifically, in years 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17, and 19). This is to ensure that [[Passover]] ({{transl|he|''Pesah''}}) is always in the spring as required by the [[Torah]] (Pentateuch) in many verses&lt;ref&gt;Exodus 23,15 ; Exodus 34,18 ; Deuteronomy 15,1 ; Deuteronomy 15, 13&lt;/ref&gt; relating to Passover.

In addition, the Hebrew calendar has postponement rules that postpone the start of the year by one or two days. These postponement rules reduce the number of different combinations of year length and starting [[Week-day names|days of the week]] from 28 to 14, and regulate the location of certain religious holidays in relation to the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]]. In particular, the first day of the Hebrew year can never be Sunday, Wednesday or Friday. This rule is known in Hebrew as "{{transl|he|''lo adu rosh''}}" ({{lang|he|לא אד"ו ראש}}), i.e., "Rosh [ha-Shanah, first day of the year] is not Sunday, Wednesday or Friday" (as the Hebrew word {{transl|he|''adu''}} is written by three [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew letters]] signifying Sunday, Wednesday and Friday). Accordingly, the first day of Passover is never Monday, Wednesday or Friday. This rule is known in Hebrew as "{{transl|he|''lo badu Pesah''}}" ({{lang|he|לא בד"ו פסח}}), which has a double meaning — "Passover is not a legend", but also "Passover is not Monday, Wednesday or Friday" (as the Hebrew word {{transl|he|''badu''}} is written by three Hebrew letters signifying Monday, Wednesday and Friday).

One reason for this rule is that [[Yom Kippur]], the holiest day in the Hebrew calendar and the tenth day of the Hebrew year, now must never be adjacent to the weekly Sabbath (which is Saturday), i.e., it must never fall on Friday or Sunday, in order not to have two adjacent Sabbath days. However, Yom Kippur can still be on Saturday. These rules for the Feasts do not apply to the years from the Creation to the deliverance of the Hebrews from Egypt under Moses. It was at that time (cf. Exodus 13) that the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob gave the Hebrews their "Law" including the days to be kept holy and the feast days and Sabbaths.

Years consisting of 12 months have between 353 and 355 days. In a {{transl|he|''k'sidra''}} ("in order") 354-day year, months have alternating 30 and 29 day lengths. In a {{transl|he|''chaser''}} ("lacking") year, the month of [[Kislev]] is reduced to 29 days. In a {{transl|he|''malei''}} ("filled") year, the month of [[Marcheshvan]] is increased to 30 days. 13-month years follow the same pattern, with the addition of the 30-day Adar Alef, giving them between 383 and 385 days.

==Islamic calendar==
The observed and calculated versions of the [[Islamic calendar]] do not have regular leap days, even though both have lunar months containing 29 or 30 days, generally in alternating order. However, the [[tabular Islamic calendar]] used by Islamic astronomers during the Middle Ages and still used by some Muslims does have a regular leap day added to the last month of the lunar year in 11 years of a 30-year cycle.&lt;ref name=timeanddateIslamicCalendar&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.timeanddate.com/date/islam-leap-year.html | title = The Islamic leap year | date = n.d. | publisher = Time and Date AS | accessdate = February 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This additional day is found at the end of the last month, Dhu 'l-Hijja, which is also the month of the [[Hajj]].&lt;ref name=GMANewsLeapYearTrivia&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/249829/lifestyle/people/leap-year-trivia-you-might-want-to-know | title = Leap year trivia you might want to know | date = n.d. | publisher = GMA News | accessdate = February 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hijri-Shamsi calendar, also adopted by the [[Ahmadiyya]] Muslim Community, is based on solar calculations and is similar to the Gregorian calendar in its structure with the exception that the first year starts with [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.alislam.org/library/history/ahmadiyya/73.html | title=Hijri-Shamsi Calendar | publisher=Al Islam | date = 2015 | accessdate=April 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hindu calendar==
In the [[Hindu calendar]], which is a lunisolar calendar, the embolismic month is called ''adhika maas'' (extra month). It is the month in which the sun is in the same sign of the stellar zodiac on two consecutive dark moons. ''Adhika maas'' occurs once every 33 to 34 months, compensating for the approximately eleven fewer days per year in twelve lunar months than the solar calendar. Thus, Hindu festivals tend to occur within a given span of the Gregorian calendar. For example: the No Moon during [[Diwali]] festival occurs between mid - October and mid - November. [[Buddhist calendar]]s in several related forms (each a simplified version of the Hindu calendar) are used on mainland Southeast Asia in the countries of [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], [[Thai lunar calendar|Thailand]], [[Myanmar (formerly Burma)]] and [[Sri Lanka]].

The Hindu Calendar also known as [[Vikram Samvat]] is used in [[Nepal]] as the national calendar. All the official work is done based on this calendar.

The calendar followed in some parts of [[South India]] (mainly in [[Tamil Nadu]]) is [[Solar calendar|solar]]. It has a leap year every four years.

==Bahá'í calendar==
{{main | Bahá'í calendar }}
The Bahá'í calendar is a solar calendar composed of 19 months of 19 days each (361 days). Years begin at Naw-Rúz, on the [[vernal equinox]], on or about March 21. A period of "Intercalary Days", called [[Ayyam-i-Ha]], are inserted before the 19th month. This period normally has 4 days, but an extra day is added when needed to ensure that the following year starts on the [[vernal equinox]]. This is calculated and known years in advance.

==Solar Hijri calendar==
{{main | Solar Hijri calendar }}
The [[Iranian calendar#Modern calendar (Solar Hejri)|Iranian calendar]] is an observational calendar that starts on the [[spring equinox]] and adds a single intercalated day to the last month (Esfand) once every four or five years; the first leap year occurs as the fifth year of the typical 33-year cycle and the remaining leap years occur every four years through the remainder of the 33-year cycle. The system used is more accurate and more complicated, and is based on the time of the March equinox as observed from [[Tehran]]. The 33-year period is not completely regular; every so often the 33-year cycle will be broken by a cycle of 29 years.

==Folk traditions==
[[File:Bob Satterfield cartoon about leap year traditions.jpg|right|thumb|upright|A [[spinster]] eagerly awaits the upcoming leap day, in this 1903 cartoon by [[Bob Satterfield (cartoonist)|Bob Satterfield.]]]]
In Ireland and Britain, it is a [[tradition]] that women may [[Proposal of marriage|propose marriage]] only in leap years. While it has been claimed that the tradition was initiated by [[Saint Patrick]] or [[Brigid of Kildare]] in 5th century Ireland, this is dubious, as the tradition has not been attested before the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Mikkelson |first1=B. | last2 = Mikkelson | first2 = D.P. | date = 2010 | url = http://www.snopes.com/oldwives/february29.asp | title = The Privilege of Ladies | website = The Urban Legends Reference Pages | publisher = snopes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supposedly, a 1288 law by Queen [[Margaret, Maid of Norway|Margaret of Scotland]] (then age five and living in Norway), required that fines be levied if a marriage proposal was refused by the man; compensation was deemed to be a pair of leather gloves, a single rose, £1 and a kiss.&lt;ref&gt;Virtually no laws of Margaret survive. Indeed, none concerning her subjects are recorded in the twelve volume ''Acts of the Parliaments of Scotland'' (1814–75) covering the period 1124–1707 (two laws concerning young Margaret herself are recorded on pages 424 &amp; 441–2 of volume I).&lt;/ref&gt; In some places the tradition was tightened to restricting female proposals to the modern leap day, February 29, or to the medieval (bissextile) leap day, February 24.

According to Felten: "A play from the turn of the 17th century, 'The Maydes Metamorphosis,' has it that 'this is leape year/women wear breeches.' A few hundred years later, breeches wouldn't do at all: Women looking to take advantage of their opportunity to pitch woo were expected to wear a scarlet [[petticoat]] — fair warning, if you will."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Felten | first = E. | date = February 23, 2008 | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB120371485815386581 | title = The Bissextile b=Beverage | website = Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Finland, the tradition is that if a man refuses a woman's proposal on leap day, he should buy her the fabrics for a skirt.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Hallett | first = S. | date = February 29, 2012 | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/27/leap-year-proposal-tradition_n_1305525.html | title = Leap Year Proposal: What's The Story Behind It? | website = Huffington Post | accessdate = December 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, since 1980, a satirical newspaper entitled ''[[La Bougie du Sapeur]]'' is published only on leap year, on February 29.

In Greece, marriage in a leap year is considered unlucky.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.anagnosis.gr/index.php?la=eng&amp;pageID=151 | title = A Greek Wedding | website = Anagnosis Books | accessdate = January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One in five engaged couples in Greece will plan to avoid getting married in a leap year.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.developingteachers.com/tips/pasttips63.htm | title = Teaching Tips 63 | website = Developing Teachers | accessdate = January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1988 the town of [[Anthony, Texas|Anthony]] in Texas, declared itself "leap year capital of the world", and an international leapling birthday club was started.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.timeanddate.com/date/leap-year-capital.html|title=Anthony – Leap Year Capital of the World|publisher=Time and Date|date=2008|accessdate=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birthdays==
A person born on February 29 may be called a "leapling" or a "leaper".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | date =February 28, 2012 | article = February 29: 29 things you need to know about leap years and their extra day | title = Mirror | accessdate = December 7, 2015| url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/leap-years-29-things-you-746716}}&lt;/ref&gt; In common years, they usually celebrate their [[birthday]]s on February 28. In some situations, March 1 is used as the birthday in a non-leap year, since it is the day following February 28.

Technically, a leapling will have fewer ''birthday anniversaries'' than their age in years. This phenomenon is exploited when a person claims to be only a quarter of their actual age, by counting their leap-year birthday anniversaries only: for example, in [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s 1879 [[comic opera]] ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'', Frederic the pirate apprentice discovers that he is bound to serve the pirates until his 21st ''birthday'' (that is, when he turns 88 years old, since 1900 was not a leap year) rather than until his 21st ''year''.

For legal purposes, legal birthdays depend on how local laws count time intervals.

===Republic of China===
{{Wikisource|Civil Code Part I General Principles}}
The Civil Code of the [[Republic of China]] since October 10, 1929,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://law.moj.gov.tw/Eng/LawClass/LawHistory.aspx?PCode=B0000001 | title = Legislative History of the Civil Code of the Republic of China}}&lt;/ref&gt; implies that the legal birthday of a leapling is February 28 in common years:

{{quote|If a period fixed by weeks, months, and years does not commence from the beginning of a week, month, or year, it ends with the ending of the day which precedes the day of the last week, month, or year which corresponds to that on which it began to commence.

===Hong Kong===
Since 1990 non-retroactively, Hong Kong considers the legal birthday of a leapling March 1 in common years:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.legislation.gov.hk/blis_ind.nsf/E1BF50C09A33D3DC482564840019D2F4/22F10EC537B1BEBAC825648300339AA3?OpenDocument | title = Age of Majority (Related Provisions) Ordinance (Ch. 410 Sec. 5) | date = June 30, 1997 | publisher = Hong Kong Department of Justice}} (Enacted in 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|
# The time at which a person attains a particular age expressed in years shall be the commencement of the anniversary corresponding to the date of [their] birth.
# Where a person has been born on February 29 in a leap year, the relevant anniversary in any year other than a leap year shall be taken to be March 1.
# This section shall apply only where the relevant anniversary falls on a date after the date of commencement of this Ordinance.}}

'''Let's Do It! World''' is a global civic movement that started from [[Estonia]], asking people worldwide to join a series of local, national and regional clean-up events.  Among other projects, it is the founder of '''[[World Cleanup Day]]'''.

The Let's Do It! movement was first conceived in Estonia in year 2008, where a country clean-up action called '''[[Let's Do It 2008|Let's do it!]]''' (in [[Estonian language|Estonian]]: "Teeme Ära!") cleaned up 10,000 tons of illegal waste by more than 50,000 volunteers in one day. Following Estonia's lead many countries also started their own country clean-up events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinkitimes.fi/htimes/domestic-news/general/15176-finland-gets-spring-cleaning.html |title=Finland gets spring cleaning |date= |accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.heifer.org/2011/07/ukrainian-participants-clean-up-their.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120715071118/http://blog.heifer.org/2011/07/ukrainian-participants-clean-up-their.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-15 |title=Ukrainian Participants Clean Up Their Village |date= |accessdate=2012-01-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 a new initiative called Let's do it!

Today, the movement has grown into a network of 113 countries. All together, 14 million participants have been engaged in movement's activities.&lt;ref&gt;Kalev Leetaru: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2016/07/30/how-pokemon-and-location-based-augmented-reality-could-save-the-planet/#4f804c9766cc "How Pokémon And Location-Based Augmented Reality Could Save The Planet"] Forbes, 2016-07-30&lt;/ref&gt;

==The origins of the massive cleanup movement==
On the 3rd of May 2008 over 50,000 people came out of their homes to clean up Estonia, the rest followed the process via all the media channels. That's 4% out of a population of 1,3 million - which would equal 15,3 million in the USA or 57 million in India. The idea spread from Estonia to the whole Europe and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20100125-anti-garbage-campaigners-plan-mass-internet-led-clean |title=Anti-garbage campaigners plan mass Internet-led clean up |date= |accessdate=2012-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100129054219/http://www.france24.com/en/20100125-anti-garbage-campaigners-plan-mass-internet-led-clean |archivedate=2010-01-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Next spring, in 2009, Latvia and Lithuania cleaned their countries with more than 250,000 people participating and have done it henceforth for three years, engaging more people each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hCNrezFwQUYGj2rJNJJ75ENwcDgQ |title=AFP: Massive clean-up drive in Latvia, Lithuania |date= |accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 March 2010 Portugal cleaned their country with 200,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euronews.net/2010/03/20/massive-countryside-clean-up-in-portugal/ |title=Massive countryside clean-up in Portugal |date= |accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Let's Clean Slovenia in One Day!|Slovenia followed shortly]], breaking all records with 270,000 people (which is 13% of the overall population of the country) taking part in the action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/video/?/video/international/2010/05/03/wv.clean.up.slovenia.cnn |title=CNN: Big clean up in Slovenia |date= |accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the beginning of June the same year, Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine was cleaned.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; By the end of 2011 more than 2.5 million people have participated in Let’s Do It! cleanup actions in 16 countries – Estonia, India, Slovenia, Serbia, Finland, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania, Portugal, Bulgaria, Moldova, Ukraine, Cambodia, Russia, Hungary and Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.letsdoitworld.org/statistics |title=Let's Do It!

==World Cleanup 2012==
In 2012, starting from 24 March until 25 September, a series of cleanups happened around the globe, on all continents, bringing together millions of volunteers in 96 countries.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; The action was initiated on 24 March 2012 by [[Let's Clean Slovenia|volunteers in Slovenia]] and [[Portugal]].

To bring together doers and initiators and share existing experience – Let's Do It! teams were organizing workshops and regional gatherings, introducing the World Cleanup 2012 around the world.

==World Cleanup actions until 2018==
After a successful World Cleanup 2012 project, the network set more ambitious goals. During the [https://web.archive.org/web/20140310071639/http://www.letsdoitworld.org/news/civic-leaders-40-countries-gather-kosovo-erase-massive-waste-problem Let's Do It! Clean World Conference held in Prishtina], Kosovo on the 6th-9th of February 2014, it was agreed, that the aim of the global movement is to clean up the whole World from illegally dumped solid waste and to then keep the planet clean. To reach the essential transformation in the global society, the leaders of country cleanups set the ambitious goal to involve 380 million people by 2018. According to Let's Do It! World, this is around 5% of the world’s population and is estimated to be the amount to create a lasting change.

==Biggest cleanup actions==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11590">The '''list of modern [[fan conventions]]''' for various genres of entertainment extends to the first conventions held in the 1930s. 

Some fan historians claim that the 1936 Philadelphia Science Fiction Conference, a.k.a. [[Philcon]], was the first  science fiction convention ever held. Others, such as [[Fred Patten]] and [[Rob Hansen]], make this claim for the January 1937 event in [[Leeds]], [[England]],&lt;ref&gt;Mike Glyer. [http://www.fiawol.org.uk/fanstuff/THEN%20Archive/1937conFirst.htm "THE FIRST EVER CONVENTION,"] ''The Story So Far'' (Worldcon, 1987).&lt;/ref&gt; organized by the Leeds Science Fiction League, which was specifically organised as a conference, with a program and speakers. Out of this came the first incarnation of the  [[British Science Fiction Association]].

While a few conventions were created in various parts of the world within the period between 1935-1960, the number of convention establishments increased slightly in the 1960s and then increased dramatically in the 1970s, with many of the largest conventions in the modern era being established during the latter decade. Impeti for further establishment of local fan conventions include:

* The return of superhero characters and franchises during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]] (1956-1970)
* science fiction adaptations for television serials (e.g., ''[[Star Trek]]'') in the 1960s-1970s
* the growth of role-playing (in the 1970s and 1980s) as a genre of tabletop, live-action and eventually video/computer gaming, which not only inspired roleplay of favorite characters in full-body costumes but also inspired existing franchises to adapt their themes for said methods of gaming
* the growth in home taping (starting with VHS in the late 1970s) of television broadcasts, including popular serials.
* the growth of computerized communication, including the Internet and Internet-dependent applications in the 1980s and 1990s.

*[[Fort Montgomery (Lake Champlain)]] was sometimes referred to as "Fort Blunder", because the first version of the U.S. fort was inadvertently built on the Canadian side of the border.
* The [[NASA]] [[Mars Climate Orbiter]], launched in 1998, burned up in the Martian atmosphere. A mixup between metric and [[U.S. customary unit|US Standard]] measurements in the controlling software caused the spacecraft to miss its intended 140–150&amp;nbsp;km altitude above Mars during orbit insertion, instead entering the Martian atmosphere at about 57&amp;nbsp;km.
* The NASA [[Genesis (spacecraft)|Genesis]] mission was an attempt to sample particles from the solar wind. It successfully collected a sample and returned to Earth. However at the last moment the landing parachute failed to open and the return capsule smashed into the ground at high speed, contaminating the samples. The parachute failure was traced to an [[Genesis (spacecraft)#Mishap_Investigation_Board_(MIB)|accelerometer installed backwards]].

In [[journalism]], '''local news''' refers to coverage of events, by the [[news]], in a local context that would not be an interest of another locality, or otherwise be of national or international scope. Local news, in contrast to national or international news, caters to the news of their regional and local communities; they focus on more localized issues and events.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Local Journalism and Local Media : Making the Local News|last=Franklin|first=Bob|publisher=Taylor and Francis|year=1998|isbn=|location=https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/aul/detail.action?docID=240326|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some key features of local newsrooms includes regional politics, business, and human interest stories.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Kelly M.|last2=Tang|first2=Tang|date=2015-10-02|title=#SocialJournalism: Local News Media on Twitter|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14241277.2015.1107569|journal=International Journal on Media Management|volume=17|issue=4|pages=241–257|doi=10.1080/14241277.2015.1107569|issn=1424-1277}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local news readership has been declining in recent years, according to a recent study.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wadbring|first=Ingela|last2=Bergström|first2=Annika|date=2017-02-01|title=A Print Crisis or a Local Crisis?|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1461670X.2015.1042988|journal=Journalism Studies|volume=18|issue=2|pages=175–190|doi=10.1080/1461670X.2015.1042988|issn=1461-670X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Television ==
Opt-outs of local [[television news]] are frequent before, during, or after national evening news [[television program]]ming.  Often times, television networks can also commission or make provisions for their local stations to produce a longer standalone local news programmes.  In some cases, local television markets/viewing areas within a country may even have a dedicated 24-hour local news channel. Local news stations have also started covering less and less local politics in favor of stories that they believe will garner more clicks or attention.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A study has also shown that there has also been less investigative journalism within local news stations in recent years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Differences ===
Local news largely covers the following:
* local sports
* local crime and justice
* local weather
* local business and economy
* local events
* local education
* local politics
* local traffic updates (especially during morning newscasts)

National and international news, however, tend to cover a wider range of content, including news concerning specialized institutions of wide-ranging international power or influence, such as:
* (inter)national political and intergovernmental events
* stock markets
* (inter)national sports competitions
* regional environmental events
* media/entertainment events
* science/technology events
* air traffic/aviatory transport events
* defense/security events

=== Practices in each country ===
In the [[United States]], local news is provided on local [[commercial broadcasting]] channels (some of which are [[television network]] [[Network affiliate|affiliate]]s).  They can either be standalone newscasts that run for at least a half-hour or short segments that air attached to national morning newscasts approximately 25 and 55 minutes past the hour.  As not all stations are owned and operated by a television network, the graphics, branding, and studio designs of a station's newscasts often differ from the network they are affiliated with although in recent years, affiliates have made some form of on-air reference to their corresponding networks in the branding of their newscasts.  In addition, the local news departments of stations also superimpose their on-screen digital clocks, thermometers, and (occasionally) local news tickers on graphics provided by networks during morning network newscasts.  Some cable channels are dedicated to local news coverage.  Examples of this include [[NY1]] in New York and [[NewsChannel 8 (cable channel)|NewsChannel 8]] in the Washington DC market.

In the [[United Kingdom]], most local news is provided on a local network station with similar branding and studio design to that of the national network news. Examples of this include the nationally networked [[BBC News]] and its regional news services such as [[BBC North West Tonight]] (on [[BBC North West]]) and [[BBC Newsline]] (on [[BBC Northern Ireland]]); the nationally networked [[ITV News]] and its regional stations including [[ITV Granada]] and [[UTV (TV channel)|UTV]].  The long version of BBC and ITV's local news shows often air during the 18:00 hour on weekday evenings.  STV, which simulcasts most of the ITV network's programmes in Scotland, is not owned and operated by ITV but has its own branded newscast that broadcasts Scottish-centred news at the same time as ITV's regional news services.

In France, most local news is aired on France Televisions' [[France 3]].  Additionally BFM TV also has a local news channel for the Ile-de-France region called BFM Paris.

Norway's public broadcaster, [[NRK1]], airs a local news programme called NRK Distriktsnyheter (name of viewing area) every weekday evening at 18:45 Central European Time, just before the main national newscast Dagsrevyen.  A replay of all local newscasts across the country is shown on NRK2 the following morning (Tuesday to Saturday).

In Sweden, SVT's regional news is simply called SVT Nyheter (name of viewing area) which shares the same branding as the network's main newscast, Rapport.  Unlike SVT's counterparts in the US and UK, during morning programmes, the local news opt-out airs in the middle of each half-hour.  Since June 2007, the morning regional cut-ins no longer feature an in-studio presenters but instead show compiled short reports from various correspondents across the region.  When SVT World was still airing, the simulcast of the morning programme featured a different regional opt-out during each half-hour.  A 13-minute standalone local newscast airs at 18:30 Central European Time each weekday evening after Sportnytt (SVT's sport news) on SVT1.  Additionally, a short local news segment is incorporated into SVT's other evening newscast Aktuellt which airs on SVT2.  In that case, this local news segment shares the same branding and graphics as Aktuellt.  There are no local SVT newscasts on Saturdays.

==Newspapers==
A lot of newspapers specialise in covering the cities they are based in.  Although paper copies of local newspapers are usually sold and circulated exclusively in the local areas they operate (with entities such as libraries or relatives wanting a copy of the paper where a family member is mentioned being mailed copies of outside of circulation areas), companies may make digital copies of their newspapers available to interested readers directly on their website or through services such as PressReader often with a paid subscription.

In the United States, although newspapers such as ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[The Washington Post]]'' have a 'national' focus on their front pages, they still have dedicated sections for news in the areas they are based in.  Weather sections also highlight conditions in the local area and the sport sections feature local teams alongside national sport stories.  Their local editions also feature local classified ads.

==Local News in the Digital Age==
In the age of digital media, local news readership has started to fall.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This can be attributed to the younger generation's disinterest in traditional news sources and the inability of news stations to fully integrate their business models and practices into the age of digital journalism.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; While national and international news industries began using Twitter as a way to break news and interact with their audiences, local news mediums have fallen behind, trending towards using Twitter as a secondary source for spreading information rather than a primary tool for audience engagement.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Since Internet sites reach a larger audience, more local news agencies have started their own websites to compete in the digital age.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Websites are a great way for local news stations to produce more interactive content, which engages the audiences and increases readership.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Aside from the Internet, Twitter specifically has become a great way to engage the younger generation in news, gain more readership, and spread information.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; National news sources have started using Twitter to quickly notify the public of breaking news and to interact with their readers, but local news have failed to integrate Twitter and other forms of social media into their journalism practices as successfully.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While local TV news stations have actually been a bit more effective with using social media, local newspapers have overall fallen behind.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; By engaging the audience and spreading important information, social media has been considered a solid method for strengthening the core standards of journalism.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As a result, social media like Twitter has become a vital tool for news agencies to incorporate into their everyday practices.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

As a result of the transition to digital content, local news agencies have had to change their business models. Although they previously gained revenue from subscriptions, more agencies have started making money from online advertising, but this only accounts for a small portion of revenue.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This loss in revenue has been linked to a decline in local journalistic integrity, because with less profit, the need to make money through clickbait articles has become a necessity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1415">'''New Milford''' is a fictional town in [[New Hampshire]], [[United States]]. It was the subject of a hoax article published in 2011 by ''The White Pine Series of Architectural Monographs'', which described the community as being a flourishing [[Victorian-era]] village in the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]] during the early 20th century. According to the article, New Milford had been incorporated in 1852 by working-class quarry workers, had enjoyed prosperity for many years, and then declined in the early 20th century, following a succession of unfortunate disasters at the quarry site, the decline of rail-based tourism, the [[Great Depression]], and the outbreak of World Wars. Research by the [[Milford, New Hampshire]], Historical Society and the New Hampshire State Library following the publication of the article led to the discovery that the article was fictitious.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.cabinet.com/cabinetcabinetnews/914158-308/tale-of-milford-history.html| title=Tale of Milford History| author=Kathy Cleveland| publisher=''The Milford Cabinet''| date=March 31, 2011| accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Al Jazeera English Doha Newsroom 1.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Al Jazeera English]] Newsroom, [[Doha]], 2008 ]]

'''News''' is [[information]] about current events. This may be provided through many different [[Media (communication)|media]]: [[word of mouth]], [[printing]], [[postal system]]s, [[broadcasting]], [[electronic communication]], or through the [[testimony]] of observers and [[witness]]es to events. It is also used as a platform to manufacture opinion for the population see [[propaganda]].

Common topics for news reports include war, government, politics, education, health, the environment, economy, business, fashion, and entertainment, as well as athletic events, quirky or unusual events. [[Government]] proclamations, concerning royal ceremonies, laws, taxes, public health, and criminals, have been dubbed news since ancient times. Humans exhibit a nearly universal desire to learn and share news, which they satisfy by talking to each other and sharing information. Technological and social developments, often driven by government communication and espionage networks, have increased the speed with which news can spread, as well as influenced its content. The genre of news as we know it today is closely associated with the [[newspaper]], which originated in China as a court bulletin and spread, with [[paper]] and [[printing press]], to Europe.

==Meaning==
===Etymology===
The [[English language|English]] word "news" developed in the 14th century as a special use of the plural form of "new". In [[Middle English]], the equivalent word was ''newes'', like the French ''[[wikt:nouvelles|nouvelles]]'' and the German ''Neues''. Similar developments are found in the [[Slavic languages]] the [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]] ''[[wikt:noviny|noviny]]'' (from ''[[wikt:nový|nový]]'', "new"), the [[cognate]] [[Polish language|Polish]] ''nowiny'', the [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] ''novini'', and [[Russian language|Russian]] ''novosti'' – and in the [[Celtic languages]]: the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''newyddion'' (from ''newydd'') and the [[Cornish language|Cornish]] ''nowodhow'' (from ''nowydh'').&lt;ref name=OED&gt;"News", ''Oxford English Dictionary'', accessed online, 5 March 2015. "Etymology: Spec. use of plural of new n., after Middle French ''nouvelles'' (see novel n.), or classical Latin ''nova'' new things, in post-classical Latin also news (from late 13th cent. in British sources), use as noun of neuter plural of ''novus'' new (compare classical Latin ''rēs nova'' (feminine singular) a new development, a fresh turn of events). Compare later {{smallcaps|novel n.}}"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=news|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jessica Garretson Finch]] is credited with coining the phrase "current events" while teaching at [[Barnard College]] in the 1890s.&lt;ref name=obituary&gt;{{cite news|title=Mrs. John Cosgrave Is Dead Founded Finch Junior College: Was Institution's President Nearly 50 Years; Coined 'Current Events' Phrase|publisher=New York Herald Tribune|date=1 November 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newness===
As its name implies, "news" typically connotes the presentation of new information.&lt;ref name=Stephens13&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith7&gt;Smith,''The Newspaper: An International History'' (1979), p. 7. "In the information which [the newspaper] chose to supply, and in the many sources of information which it took over and reorganized, it contained a bias towards recency or newness; to its readers, it offered regularity of publication. It had to be filled with whatever was available, unable to wait until information of greater clarity or certainty or of wider perspective had accumulated."&lt;/ref&gt; The newness of news gives it an uncertain quality which distinguishes it from the more careful investigations of history or other scholarly disciplines.&lt;ref name=Smith7 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Salmon, ''The Newspaper and the Historian'' (1923), p. 10. Salmon quotes [[Théophraste Renaudot]]: "History is the record of things accomplished. A ''Gazette'' is the reflection of feelings and rumors of the time which may or may not be true."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pettegree3&gt;Pettegree, ''The Invention of News'' (2014), p. 3. "Even as news became more plentiful in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the problem of establishing the veracity of news reports remained acute. The news market—and by the sixteenth century it was a real market—was humming with conflicting reports, some incredible, some all too plausible: lives, fortunes, even the fate of kingdoms could depend upon acting on the right information."&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas historians tend to view events as causally related manifestations of underlying processes, news stories tend to describe events in isolation, and to exclude discussion of the relationships between them.&lt;ref name=Park675&gt;Park, "News as a Form of Knowledge" (1940), pp. 675–676. "News is not history because, for one thing among others, it deals, on the whole, with isolated events and does not seek to relate them to one another either in the form of causal or in the form of teleological sequences."&lt;/ref&gt; News conspicuously describes the world in the present or immediate past, even when the most important aspects of a news story have occurred long in the past—or are expected to occur in the future. To make the news, an ongoing process must have some "peg", an event in time which anchors it to the present moment.&lt;ref name=Park675 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schudson, "When? Deadlines, Datelines, and History"; in ''Reading The News'' (1986), ed. Manoff &amp; Schudson; pp. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt; Relatedly, news often addresses aspects of reality which seem unusual, deviant, or out of the ordinary.&lt;ref&gt;Shoemaker &amp; Cohen, ''News Around the World'' (2006), pp. 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the famous dictum that "Dog Bites Man" is not news, but "Man Bites Dog" is.&lt;ref&gt;Park, "News as a Form of Knowledge" (1940), p. 678.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another corollary of the newness of news is that, as new technology enables new media to disseminate news more quickly, 'slower' forms of communication may move away from 'news' towards 'analysis'.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 56. "It is axiomatic in journalism that the fastest medium with the largest potential audience will disseminate the bulk of a community's breaking news. Today that race is being won by television and radio. Consequently, daily newspapers are beginning to underplay breaking news about yesterday's events (already old news to much of their audience) in favor of more analytical perspectives on those events. In other words, dailies are now moving in the direction toward which weeklies retreated when dailies were introduced."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commodity===
According to some theories, "news" is whatever the news industry sells.&lt;ref&gt;Heyd, ''Reading newspapers'' (2012), pp. 35, 82. "... newspapers were defining what news was, categorizing and expanding their domain on the fly. Indeed, Somerville argues that 'news' is not an objective 'historical' concept but one that is defined by the news industry as it creates a commodity sold by publishers to the public."&lt;/ref&gt; Journalism, broadly understood along the same lines, is the act or occupation of collecting and providing news.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 3. "The term ''journalism'' is used broadly here and elsewhere in the book to refer to more than just the production of printed 'journals'; it is the most succinct term we have for the activity of gathering and disseminating news."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shoemaker &amp; Cohen, ''News Around the World'' (2006), p. 7. "[...] for the journalist the assessment of newsworthiness is an operationalization based on the aforementioned conditions. In other words, the practitioner typically constructs a method for fulfilling the daily job requirements. He or she rarely has an underlying theoretical understanding of what defining something or someone as ''newsworthy'' entails. To be sure, individual journalists may engage in more abstract musings about their work, but the profession as a whole is content to apply these conditions and does not care that the theory behind the application is not widely understood. Hall (1981, 147) calls news a 'slippery' concept, with journalists defining newsworthiness as those things that get into the news media."&lt;/ref&gt; From a commercial perspective, news is simply one input, along with paper (or an electronic server) necessary to prepare a final product for distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Pettegree, ''The Invention of News'' (2014), p. 6. "News fitted ideally into the expanding market for cheap print, and it swiftly became an important commodity."&lt;/ref&gt; A news agency supplies this resource "wholesale" and publishers enhance it for retail.&lt;ref name=Globalization6&gt;Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), p. 6. "News agency news is considered 'wholesale' resource material, something that has to be worked upon, smelted, reconfigured, for conversion into a news report that is suitable for consumption by ordinary readers. It has also suited the news agencies to be thus presented: they have needed to seem credible to extensive networks of 'retail' clients of many different political and cultural shades and hues. They have wanted to avoid controversy, to maintain an image of plain, almost dull, but completely dependable professionalism."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MacGregor&gt;Phil MacGregor, "International News Agencies: Global eyes that never blink", in Fowler-Watt &amp; Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tone===
Most purveyors of news value impartiality, neutrality, and [[Journalistic objectivity|objectivity]], despite the inherent difficulty of reporting without political bias.&lt;ref&gt;Heyd, ''Reading newspapers'' (2012), pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt; Perception of these values has changed greatly over time as sensationalized '[[tabloid journalism]]' has risen in popularity. [[Michael Schudson]] has argued that before the era of World War I and the concomitant rise of [[propaganda]], journalists were not aware of the concept of [[media bias|bias in reporting]], let alone actively correcting for it.&lt;ref&gt;Schudson, ''Discovering the News'' (1978), p. 6. "Before the 1920s, journalists did not think much about the subjectivity of perception. They had relatively little incentive to doubt the firmness of the reality by which they lived. […] After World War I, however, this changed. Journalists, like others, lost faith in the democratic market society had taken for granted. Their experience of propaganda during the war and public relations thereafter convinced them that the world they reported was one that interested parties had constructed for them to report. In such a world, naïve empiricism could not last."&lt;/ref&gt; News is also sometimes said to portray the [[truth]], but this relationship is elusive and qualified.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paradoxically, another property commonly attributed to news is [[sensationalism]], the disproportionate focus on, and exaggeration of, emotive stories for public consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 2. "Sensationalism appears to be a technique or style that is rooted somehow in the nature of the news. News obviously can do much more than merely sensationalize, but most news ''is'', in an important sense, sensational: it is intended, in part, to arouse, to excite, often—whether the subject is a political scandal or a double murder—to shock."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SKH&gt;Jesper Strömbäck, Michael Karlsson, &amp; Nicolas Hopmann, "Determinants of News Content: Comparing journalists' perceptions of the normative and actual impact of different event properties when deciding what's news". ''Journalism Studies'' 13.5–6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This news is also not unrelated to [[gossip]], the human practice of sharing information about other humans of mutual interest.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), pp. 26, 105–106.&lt;/ref&gt; A common sensational topic is violence; hence another news dictum, "if it bleeds, it leads".&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newsworthiness===
Newsworthiness is defined as a subject having sufficient relevance to the public or a special audience to warrant press attention or coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/newsworthiness |title=definition of newsworthiness by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus, and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |accessdate=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists apply news values to identify a news story. News values determine how much attention a news story is given by a media outlet, and the attention it is given by its audience or readers.&lt;ref name="Spencer-Thomas 2011"&gt;{{Cite web | title = News Values | last = Spencer-Thomas | first = Owen | work = [[Owen Spencer-Thomas]] | date = 2011 | accessdate = 2018-10-13 | url = http://www.owenspencer-thomas.com/journalism/newsvalues/ | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries and at some points in history, what news media and the public have considered "newsworthy" has met different definitions, such as the notion of [[news values]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.owenspencer-thomas.com/journalism/newsvalues |title=News values: immediacy and technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many news values seem to be common across cultures. People seem to be interested in news to the extent which it has a big impact, describes conflicts, happens nearby, involves well-known people, and deviates from the norms of everyday happenings.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; War is a common news topic, partly because it involves unknown events that could pose personal danger.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see also|History of telecommunication}}

===Folk news===
Evidence suggests that cultures around the world have found a place for people to share stories about interesting new information. Among Zulus, Mongolians, Polynesians, and American Southerners, anthropologists have documented the practice of questioning travelers for news as a matter of priority.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), pp. 14, 305. "The desire to pass on tales of current events could be found even in cultures that did not have writing—let alone printing presses or computers—to whet or satisfy their thirst for news. Observers have often remarked on the fierce concern with the news that they find in preliterate or semiliterate peoples. […] It is difficult, if not impossible, to find a society that does not exchange news and that does not build into its rituals and customs means for facilitating that exchange."&lt;/ref&gt; Sufficiently important news would be repeated quickly and often, and could spread by word of mouth over a large geographic area.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Even as printing presses came into use in Europe, news for the general public often travelled orally via monks, travelers, town criers, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Fang, ''History of Mass Communication'' (1997), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The news is also transmitted in public gathering places, such as the Greek forum and the Roman baths. Starting in England, [[coffeehouses]] served as important sites for the spread of news, even after telecommunications became widely available.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 8. "A particularly lively forum for the exchange of news by word of mouth—the coffeehouse—flourished in England well after the development of the newspaper, and in some countries, the coffeehouse has survived even the introduction of television."&lt;/ref&gt; In the Muslim world, people have gathered and exchanged news at [[mosque]]s and other social places. Travelers on pilgrimages to Mecca traditionally stay at [[caravanserai]]s, roadside inns, along the way, and these places have naturally served as hubs for gaining news of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Ayalon, ''The Press in the Arab Middle East: A History'' (1995), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In late medieval Britain, reports ("tidings") of major events were a topic of great public interest, as chronicled in Chaucer's 1380 ''[[The House of Fame]]'' and other works.&lt;ref&gt;Lim, "Take Writing" (2006), pp. 1–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government proclamations===
[[File:Fotothek df tg 0007253 Ständebuch ^ Beruf ^ Ausrufer.jpg|thumb|Woodcut by [[Tommaso Garzoni]] depicting a town crier with a trumpet]]

Before the invention of newspapers in the early 17th century, official government bulletins and [[edicts]] were circulated at times in some centralized empires.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mashable.com/follow/topics/news/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519215200/http://mashable.com/follow/topics/news/|date=May 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first documented use of an organized [[courier]] service for the diffusion of written documents is in [[Egypt]], where [[Pharaoh]]s used couriers for the diffusion of their decrees in the territory of the State (2400 BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucsams.nl/ |title=United Courier Systems |publisher=Ucsams.nl |accessdate=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=October 2014}} [[Julius Caesar]] regularly publicized his heroic deeds in Gaul, and upon becoming Emperor of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] began publishing government announcements called ''[[Acta Diurna]]''. These were carved in metal or stone and posted in public places.&lt;ref name="Allan, 2004 p. 9"&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Straubhaar and LaRose, ''Communications Media in the Information Society'' (1997), p. 390.&lt;/ref&gt; In England, parliamentary declarations were delivered to [[Reeve (England)|sheriffs]] for public display and reading at the market.&lt;ref&gt;Lim, "Take Writing" (2006), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Specially sanctioned messengers have been recognized in [[Culture of Vietnam|Vietnamese culture]], among the [[Khasi people]] in India, and in the [[Meskwaki|Fox]] and [[Ho-Chunk|Winnebago]] cultures of the American midwest. The [[Zulu Kingdom]] used runners to quickly disseminate news. In West Africa, news can be spread by [[griot]]s. In most cases, the official spreaders of news have been closely aligned with holders of political power.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 27–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Town criers]] were a common means of conveying information to citydwellers. In thirteenth-century Florence, criers known as ''banditori'' arrived in the market regularly, to announce political news, to convoke public meetings, and to call the populace to arms. In 1307 and 1322–1325, laws were established governing their appointment, conduct, and salary. These laws stipulated how many times a banditoro was to repeat a proclamation (forty) and where in the city they were to read them.&lt;ref&gt;Milner, "Fanno bandire" (2013), pp. 110–112.&lt;/ref&gt; Different declarations sometimes came with additional protocols; announcements regarding the plague were also to be read at the city gates.&lt;ref&gt;Milner, "Fanno bandire" (2013), p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; These proclamations all used a standard format, beginning with an ''[[Exordium (rhetoric)|exordium]]''—"The worshipful and most esteemed gentlemen of the Eight of Ward and Security of the city of Florence make it known, notify, and expressly command, to whosoever, of whatever status, rank, quality and condition"—and continuing with a statement (''narratio''), a request made upon the listeners (''petitio''), and the penalty to be exacted from those who would not comply (''peroratio'').&lt;ref&gt;Milner, "Fanno bandire" (2013), p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to major declarations, ''bandi'' (announcements) might concern petty crimes, requests for information, and notices about missing slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Milner, "Fanno bandire" (2013), pp. 122–123.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] was captured by the Medicis in 1513, following a bando calling for his immediate surrender.&lt;ref&gt;Milner, "Fanno bandire" (2013), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Some town criers could be paid to include advertising along with news.&lt;ref&gt;Straubhaar and LaRose, ''Communications Media in the Information Society'' (1997), p. 366. "Another ancient form of advertising was the town crier, who told the citizenry about the 'good deal' to be found 'just around the corner'. Unlike the signs, which contained only information regarding the merchant, the criers also informed the citizens of the news of the day. Because the crier, or his agent, was compensated for his assistance in getting the advertising message out in the context of the news, there are interesting parallels with the newspaper of today (Applegate, 1993; Roche, 1993; Schramm, 1988)."&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Ottoman Empire]], official messages were regularly distributed at [[mosque]]s, by traveling holy men, and by secular criers. These criers were sent to read official announcements in marketplaces, highways, and other well-traveled places, sometimes issuing commands and penalties for disobedience.&lt;ref&gt;Ayalon, ''The Press in the Arab Middle East: A History'' (1995), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early news networks===
The spread of news has always been linked to the communications networks in place to disseminate it. Thus, political, religious, and commercial interests have historically controlled, expanded, and monitored communications channels by which news could spread. [[Mail|Postal services]] have long been closely entwined with the maintenance of political power in a large area.&lt;ref name=Fang14&gt;Fang, ''History of Mass Communication'' (1997), pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stephens27&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 27. "Whoever controlled the messengers could select which anecdotes and information would be favored by this treatment. Therefore, whoever controlled the messengers gained not only a conduit to the members of a society—the ability to inform them of new regulations—but gained a measure of power over the selection of news the members of a society received—the power, for example to ensure that they received news of triumphs but not necessarily of debacles. Messengers were controlled, for the most part, by kings, chiefs, headmen. They were rarely channels of dissent."&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the imperial communication channels, called the "[[Royal Road]]" traversed the [[Assyrian Empire]] and served as a key source of its power.&lt;ref&gt;Kessler, "Royal Roads" (1995), p. 129. "The ability of the Assyrian court to challenge a huge and permanent stream of information seems to have been one of the essential factors for the long maintenance of Assyrian domination, over the vast areas in the Near East."&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman Empire maintained a vast network of roads, known as ''[[cursus publicus]]'', for similar purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Pettegree, ''The Invention of News'' (2014), pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Visible chains of long distance signaling, known as [[optical telegraph]]y, have also been used throughout history to convey limited types of information. These can have ranged from smoke and fire signals to advanced systems using semaphore codes and telescopes.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bakker13 /&gt; The latter form of optical telegraph came into use in Japan, Britain, France, and Germany from the 1790s through the 1850s.&lt;ref&gt;Starr, ''Creation of the Media'' (2004), pp. 156–157.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Distelrath45 /&gt;

====Asia====
[[File:KaiYuanZaBaoRemake.jpg|thumb|Reproduction of Kaiyuan Za Bao court newspaper from the Tang dynasty]]
The world's first written news may have originated in [[Spring and Autumn period|eighth century BCE China]], where reports gathered by officials were eventually compiled as the ''[[Spring and Autumn Annals]]''. The annals, whose compilation is attributed to [[Confucius]], were available to a sizeable reading public and dealt with common news themes—though they straddle the line between news and history.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, ''Origins of the Modern Chinese Press'' (2007), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Han dynasty]] is credited with developing one of the most effective imperial surveillance and communications networks in the ancient world.&lt;ref&gt;Smith,''The Newspaper: An International History'' (1979), p. 14. "The Chinese civilization was one of the earliest to have found it convenient to set up a systematic news-collection network across a large land mass. During the Han dynasty (206BC–AD219) the imperial court arranged to be supplied with information on the events of the Empire by means of a postal empire similar to the princely message systems of the European Middle Ages, when the postmasters of the Holy Roman Empire were required to write summaries of events taking place within their regions and transmit them along specified routes."&lt;/ref&gt; Government-produced news sheets, called [[tipao]], circulated among court officials during the late Han dynasty (second and third centuries AD). Between 713 and 734, the ''[[Kaiyuan Za Bao]]'' ("Bulletin of the Court") of the Chinese [[Tang Dynasty]] published government news; it was handwritten on silk and read by government officials.&lt;ref name=Smith14 /&gt; The court created a Bureau of Official Reports (''Jin Zhouyuan'') to centralize news distribution for the court.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, ''Origins of the Modern Chinese Press'' (2007), p. 14. "However, it was in the Tang dynasty that a specific bureau—the Bureau of Official Reports (''Jin Zhouyuan'')—was created to accommodate the local representatives. During this time, there were many rising powerful dukes, princes or governor-generals in charge of the large territories, equal in size to a modern province in China. These dukes or princes would naturally provide for their own news service at the capital Chang'an, which handled all official documents submitted by these representatives and transmitted imperial edicts in return. Recent archaeological research has uncovered such official reports from the Tang dynasty. Two archive documents of that period, originally found in Dunhuang have been regarded by Chinese scholars as the earliest forms of newspaper in the world (Fang 1997 53–8)"&lt;/ref&gt; Newsletters called ''ch'ao pao'' continued to be produced and gained wider public circulation in the following centuries.&lt;ref name=Smith14a&gt;Smith,''The Newspaper: An International History'' (1979), p. 14. "At a later stage of its development, during the Sung period (960–1278), the ''ti pao'' was made to circulate among the purely intellectual groups, and during the Ming (1367–1644) was seen by a wider circle of society."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1582 there was the first reference to privately published newssheets in [[Beijing]], during the late [[Ming Dynasty]].&lt;ref name="brook xxi"&gt;[[Timothy Brook (historian)|Brook, Timothy]]. (1998). ''[[The Confusions of Pleasure: Commerce and Culture in Ming China]]''. Berkeley: [[University of California Press]]. {{ISBN|0520221540}} (Paperback). p. xxi.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), pp. 68–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan had effective communications and postal delivery networks at several points in its history, first in 646 with the [[Taika Reform]] and again during the [[Kamakura period]] from 1183–1333. The system depended on ''hikyaku'', runners, and regularly spaced relay stations. By this method, news could travel between Kyoto and Kamakura in 5–7 days. Special horse-mounted messengers could move information at the speed of 170 kilometers per day.&lt;ref name=Distelrath45&gt;Distelrath, "Development of the Information and Communication Systems in Germany and Japan" (2000), pp. 45–46 .&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alice Gordenker, "Postal Symbol"; ''Japan Times'', 21 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese shogunates were less tolerant than the Chinese government of news circulation.&lt;ref name=Smith14&gt;Smith,''The Newspaper: An International History'' (1979), p. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt; The postal system established during the [[Edo period]] was even more effective, with average speeds of 125–150&amp;nbsp;km/day and express speed of 200&amp;nbsp;km/day. This system was initially used only by the government, taking private communications only at exorbitant prices. Private services emerged and in 1668 established their own ''[[Kabunakama|nakama]]'' (guild). They became even faster, and created an effective optical telegraphy system using flags by day and lanterns and mirrors by night.&lt;ref name=Distelrath45 /&gt;

====Europe====
In Europe, during the Middle Ages, elites relied on runners to transmit news over long distances. At 33 kilometres per day, a runner would take two months to bring a message across the [[Hanseatic League]] from Bruges to Riga.&lt;ref&gt;Distelrath, "Development of the Information and Communication Systems in Germany and Japan" (2000), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lampe &amp; Ploeckl, "Spanning the Globe" (2014), 247.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Early modern Europe|early modern period]], increased cross-border interaction created a rising need for information which was met by concise handwritten newssheets. The driving force of this new development was the commercial advantage provided by up-to-date news.&lt;ref name=Pettegree3 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCusker &amp; Gravesteijn, ''Beginnings of Commercial and Financial Journalism'' (1991), p. 21. "Business thrives on the most recent news. The merchants of the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries, no less than those of today, required the 'freshest advices' in order to conduct their affairs profitably."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1556, the government of [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] first published the monthly ''Notizie scritte'', which cost one [[gazette|gazetta]].&lt;ref name="WAN timeline"&gt;[http://www.wan-press.org/article2822.html Wan-Press.org] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111093302/http://www.wan-press.org/article2822.html |date=2012-01-11 }}, A Newspaper Timeline, [[World Association of Newspapers]]&lt;/ref&gt; These [[avviso|avvisi]] were handwritten newsletters and used to convey political, military, and economic news quickly and efficiently to Italian cities (1500–1700)—sharing some characteristics of [[newspapers]] though usually not considered true newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Infelise, Mario. "Roman Avvisi: Information and Politics in the Seventeenth Century." Court and Politics in Papal Rome, 1492–1700. Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], 2002. 212, 214, 216–217&lt;/ref&gt; ''Avvisi'' were sold by subscription under the auspices of military, religious, and banking authorities. Sponsorship flavored the contents of each series, which were circulated under many different names. Subscribers included clerics, diplomatic staff, and noble families. By the last quarter of the seventeenth century ''avvisi'' long passages from were finding their way into published monthlies such as the [[Mercure de France]] and, in northern Italy, ''Pallade veneta''.&lt;ref&gt;Selfridge-Field, Eleanor. ''Pallade Veneta: Writings on Music and Society, 1650–1750''. Venice: Fondazione Ugo e Olga Levi, 1985. Chs. 1 2, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Selfridge-Field, Eleanor. ''Song and Season: Science, Culture, and Theatrical Time''. Stanford: [[Stanford University Press]], 2007. Chs. 10, 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pettegree, ''The Invention of News'' (2014), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Postkurse 1563.jpg|thumb|Some European postal routes in 1563]]
Postal services enabled merchants and monarchs to stay abreast of important information. For the [[Holy Roman Empire]], Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximillian I]] in 1490 authorized two brothers from the Italian Tasso family, Francesco and Janettto, to create a network of courier stations linked by riders. They began with a communications line between Innsbruck and Mechelen and grew from there.&lt;ref name=LampePloeckl248&gt;Lampe &amp; Ploeckl, "Spanning the Globe" (2014), 248.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1505 this network expanded to Spain, new governed by Maximilian's son [[Philip I of Castile|Philip]]. These riders could travel 180 kilometers in a day.&lt;ref&gt;Pettegree, ''The Invention of News'' (2014), pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; This system became the [[Reichspost|Imperial Reichspost]], administered by Tasso descendents (subsequently known as [[Lamoral II Claudius Franz, Count of Thurn and Taxis|Thurn-und-Taxis]]), who in 1587 received exclusive operating rights from the Emperor.&lt;ref name=LampePloeckl248 /&gt; The [[La Poste (France)|French postal service]] and [[General Post Office|English postal service]] also began at this time, but did not become comprehensive until the early 1600s.&lt;ref name=LampePloeckl248 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Starr, ''Creation of the Media'' (2004), pp. 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fang, ''History of Mass Communication'' (1997), pp. 29–30.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1620, the English system linked with Thurn-und-Taxis.&lt;ref name=Bakker13&gt;Bakker, "Trading Facts" (2011), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

These connections underpinned an extensive system of news circulation, with handwritten items bearing dates and places of origin. Centred in Germany, the network took in news from Russia, the Balkans, Italy, Britain, France, and the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Smith,''The Newspaper: An International History'' (1979), pp. 18–19. "Since the late Middle Ages a formal network of correspondents and intelligence agents had come into being across the bulk of the European continent, busily sending news of military, diplomatic and ecclesiastical affairs along a series of prescribed routes. The information was handwritten and passed along carefully organized chains, each item being labeled with its place and date of origin."&lt;/ref&gt; The German lawyer [[Christoph von Scheurl]] and the [[Fugger]] house of Augsburg were prominent hubs in this network.&lt;ref name=Bakker11 /&gt; Letters describing historically significant events could gain wide circulation as news reports. Indeed, personal correspondence sometimes acted only as a convenient channel through which news could flow across a larger network.&lt;ref&gt;Lim, "Take Writing" (2006), pp. 35–45.&lt;/ref&gt; A common type of business communication was a simple listing of current prices, the circulation of which quickened the flow of international trade.&lt;ref name=Bakker10&gt;Bakker, "Trading Facts" (2011), pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kallionen, "Information, communication technology, and business" (2004), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Businesspeople also wanted to know about events related to shipping, the affairs of other businesses, and political developments.&lt;ref name=Bakker10 /&gt; Even after the advent of international newspapers, business owners still valued correspondence highly as a source of reliable news that would affect their enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;Kallionen, "Information, communication technology, and business" (2004), p. 21. "Although the businessmen obtained information from newspapers and other public sources, for instance, from the consuls stationed in foreign towns, they placed special value on the letters received directly from their foreign partners. This is precisely the key to the existence of a network relationship: the parties were dependent on the resources controlled by both parties, both goods and information, so by mutual co-operation both parties gained mutual benefits. Long-term, personal networks were particularly well suited for transmitting information that required high reliability.&lt;/ref&gt; Handwritten newsletters, which could be produced quickly for a limited clientele, also continued into the 1600s.&lt;ref name=Bakker11&gt;Bakker, "Trading Facts" (2011), pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rise of the newspaper===

{{see also|History of newspapers and magazines}}
The [[History of paper|spread of paper]] and the [[History of printing|printing press]] from China to Europe preceded a major advance in the transmission of news.&lt;ref&gt;Fang, ''History of Mass Communication'' (1997), pp. 20–23.&lt;/ref&gt; With the spread of printing presses and the creation of new markets in the 1500s, news underwent a shift from factual and precise economic reporting, to a more emotive and freewheeling format. (Private newsletters containing important intelligence therefore remained in use by people who needed to know.)&lt;ref&gt;Pettegree, ''The Invention of News'' (2014), pp. 6–8. "So this sort of news reporting was very different from the discreet, dispassionate services of the manuscript news men. News pamphlets were often committed and engaged, intended to persuade as well as inform. News also became, for the first time, part of the entertainment industry. What could be more entertaining than the tale of some catastrophe in a far-off place, or a grisly murder? This was not unproblematic, particularly for the traditional leaders of society who were used to news being part of a confidential service, provided by trusted agents."&lt;/ref&gt; The [[List of the oldest newspapers|first newspapers]] emerged in Germany in the early 1600s.&lt;ref&gt;Pettegree, ''The Invention of News'' (2014), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Relation aller Fürnemmen und gedenckwürdigen Historien]], from 1605, is recognized as the world's first formalized 'newspaper';&lt;ref name="Relation"&gt;{{harvnb|Weber|2006|p=396}}; World Association of Newspapers: [http://www.wan-press.org/article6476.html "Newspapers: 400 Years Young!"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310235015/http://www.wan-press.org/article6476.html |date=2010-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while not a 'newspaper' in the modern sense, the Ancient Roman [[acta diurna]] served a similar purpose circa 131 BC.

The new format, which mashed together numerous unrelated and perhaps dubious reports from far-flung locations, created a radically new and jarring experience for its readers.&lt;ref&gt;Pettegree, ''The Invention of News'' (2014), p. 9. "The news reporting of the newspapers was very different, and utterly unfamiliar to those who had not previously been subscribers to the manuscript service. Each report was no more than a couple sentences long. It offered no explanation, comment, or commentary. Unlike a news pamphlet the reader did not know where this fitted in the narrative—or even whether what was reported would turn out to be important."&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of styles emerged, from single-story tales, to compilations, overviews, and personal and impersonal types of news analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Smith,''The Newspaper: An International History'' (1979), pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

News for public consumption was at first tightly controlled by governments. By 1530, England had created a licensing system for the press and banned "seditious opinions".&lt;ref&gt;Cranfield, ''Press and Society'' (1978), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Licensing Order of 1643|Licensing Act]], publication was restricted to approved presses—as exemplified by The London Gazette, which prominently bore the words: "Published By Authority".&lt;ref&gt;Heyd, ''Reading newspapers'' (2012), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Parliament allowed the Licensing Act to lapse in 1695, beginning a new era marked by [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] and [[Tory (British political grouping)|Tory]] newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Heyd, ''Reading newspapers'' (2012), pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; (During this era, the [[Stamp Act 1712|Stamp Act]] limited newspaper distribution simply by making them expensive to sell and buy.) In France, censorship was even more constant.&lt;ref&gt;Starr, ''Creation of the Media'' (2004), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, many Europeans read newspapers originating from beyond their national borders—especially from the [[Dutch Republic]], where publishers could evade state censorship.&lt;ref&gt;Starr, ''Creation of the Media'' (2004), pp. 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

The new United States saw a newspaper boom beginning with the Revolutionary era, accelerated by spirited debates over the establishment of a new government, spurred on by subsidies contained in the 1792 [[Postal Service Act]], and continuing into the 1800s.&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, "Trading Facts" (2011), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Starr, ''Creation of the Media'' (2004), pp. 69–73.&lt;/ref&gt; American newspapers got many of their stories by copying reports from each other. Thus by offering free postage to newspapers wishing to exchange copies, the Postal Service Act subsidized a rapidly growing news network through which different stories could percolate.&lt;ref&gt;Starr, ''Creation of the Media'' (2004), p. 90. "The 1792 law codified the right of newspapers to exchange copies for free with one another, and by the 1840s the average newspaper received an astonishing 4,300 exchange copies a year. Editors relied on other papers for the national news that filled most of their columns. In effect, the federal government was encouraging local papers to become outlets for a national news network that the government itself did not control."&lt;/ref&gt; Newspapers thrived during the colonization of the [[American frontier|West]], fueled by high literacy and a newspaper-loving culture.&lt;ref&gt;Cloud, ''Frontier Press'' (2008), pp. 8–9, 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1880, San Francisco rivaled New York in number of different newspapers and in printed newspaper copies per capita.&lt;ref&gt;Cloud, ''Frontier Press'' (2008), pp. 31, 73.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Boosterism|Boosters]] of new towns felt that newspapers covering local events brought legitimacy, recognition, and community.&lt;ref&gt;Cloud, ''Frontier Press'' (2008), pp. 67–69.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1830s American, wrote [[Alexis de Tocqueville]], was "a very civilized man prepared for a time to face life in the forest, plunging into the wilderness of the New World with his Bible, ax, and newspapers."&lt;ref&gt;Starr, ''Creation of the Media'' (2004), p. 48. [''"Tout est primitif et sauvage autour de lui, mais lui est pour ainsi dire le résultat de dix-huit siècles de travaux et d'expérience. Il porte le vêtement des villes, en parle la langue; sait le passé, est curieux de l'avenir, argumente sur le présent; c'est un homme très civilisé, qui, pour un temps, se soumet à vivre au milieu des bois, et qui s'enfonce dans les déserts du Nouveau Monde avec la Bible, une hache et des journaux."'']&lt;/ref&gt; In France, the Revolution brought forth an abundance of newspapers and a new climate of press freedom, followed by a return to repression under Napoleon.&lt;ref&gt;Smith,''The Newspaper: An International History'' (1979), pp. 88–89.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1792 the Revolutionaries set up a news ministry called the ''Bureau d'Esprit''.&lt;ref&gt;Straubhaar and LaRose, ''Communications Media in the Information Society'' (1997), p. 391.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some newspapers published in the 1800s and after retained the commercial orientation characteristic of the private newsletters of the Renaissance. Economically oriented newspapers published new types of data enabled the advent of [[statistics]], especially [[economic statistics]] which could inform sophisticated investment decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, ''Power of the Financial Press'' (1989), p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; These newspapers, too, became available for larger sections of society, not just elites, keen on investing some of their savings in the [[stock market]]s. Yet, as in the case other newspapers, the incorporation of advertising into the newspaper led to justified reservations about accepting newspaper information at face value.&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, ''Power of the Financial Press'' (1989), p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Economic newspapers also became promoters of economic ideologies, such as [[Keynesianism]] in the mid-1900s.&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, ''Power of the Financial Press'' (1989), pp. 81–110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Newspapers came to sub-Saharan Africa via colonization. The first English-language newspaper in the area was ''The Royal Gazette and Sierra Leone Advertiser'', established in 1801, and followed by ''The Royal Gold Coast Gazette and Commercial Intelligencer'' in 1822 and the ''Liberia Herald'' in 1826.&lt;ref&gt;Fosu, "The Press and Political Participation" (2014), p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; A number of nineteenth-century African newspapers were established by missionaries.&lt;ref name=Fosu60&gt;Fosu, "The Press and Political Participation" (2014), pp. 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt; These newspapers by and large promoted the colonial governments and served the interests of European settlers by relaying news from Europe.&lt;ref name=Fosu60 /&gt; The first newspaper published in a native African language was the ''Muigwithania'', published in Kikuyu by the Kenyan Central Association.&lt;ref name=Fosu60 /&gt; ''Muigwithania'' and other newspapers published by indigenous Africans took strong opposition stances, agitating strongly for African independence.&lt;ref&gt;Fosu, "The Press and Political Participation" (2014), p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; Newspapers were censored heavily during the colonial period—as well as after formal independence. Some liberalization and diversification took place in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Fosu, "The Press and Political Participation" (2014), pp. 64–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Newspapers were slow to [[Arab culture|spread to the Arab world]], which had a stronger tradition of [[Communication#Verbal|oral communication]], and mistrust of the European approach to news reporting. By the end of the eighteenth century, the Ottoman Empire's leaders in Istanbul did monitor the European press, but its contents were not disseminated for mass consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Ayalon, ''The Press in the Arab Middle East: A History'' (1995), pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the first written news in modern North Africa arose in Egypt under [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]], who developed the local paper industry and initiated the limited circulation of news bulletins called ''jurnals''.&lt;ref&gt;Ayalon, ''The Press in the Arab Middle East: A History'' (1995), pp. 13–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1850s and 1860s, the private press began to develop in the multi-religious country of Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;Ayalon, ''The Press in the Arab Middle East: A History'' (1995), pp. 28–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newswire===
The development of the [[electrical telegraph]], which often travelled along railroad lines, enabled news to travel faster, over longer distances.&lt;ref&gt;Wenzlhuemer, ''Connecting the Nineteenth-Century World'' (2013), pp. 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt; (Days before Morse's Baltimore–Washington line transmitted the famous question, "What hath God wrought?", it transmitted the news that Henry Clay and Theodore Frelinghuysen had been chosen by the Whig nominating party.)&lt;ref name="Allan, 2004 p. 9"/&gt; Telegraph networks enabled a new centralization of the news, in the hands of [[wire services]] concentrated in major cities. The modern form of these originated with [[Charles-Louis Havas]], who founded Bureau Havas (later [[Agence France-Presse]]) in Paris. Havas began in 1832, using the French government's optical telegraph network. In 1840 he began using pigeons for communications to Paris, London, and Brussels. Havas began to use the electric telegraph when it became available.&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, "Trading Facts" (2011), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Havas's protoges, [[Bernhard Wolff]], founded [[Wolffs Telegraphisches Bureau]] in Berlin in 1849.&lt;ref&gt;Starr, ''Creation of the Media'' (2004), p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; Another Havas disciple, [[Paul Reuter]], began collecting news from Germany and France in 1849, and in 1851 immigrated to London, where he established the [[Reuters]] news agency—specializing in news from the continent.&lt;ref&gt;Salmon, ''The Newspaper and the Historian'' (1923), p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1863, William Saunders and Edward Spender formed the [[Central News Agency (London)|Central Press]] agency, later called the [[Press Association]], to handle domestic news.&lt;ref&gt;Salmon, ''The Newspaper and the Historian'' (1923), pp. 117–118.&lt;/ref&gt; Just before insulated telegraph line crossed the English Channel in 1851, Reuter won the right to transmit stock exchange prices between Paris and London.&lt;ref name=Wenzlhuemer90&gt;Wenzlhuemer, ''Connecting the Nineteenth-Century World'' (2013), pp. 90–92.&lt;/ref&gt; He maneuvered Reuters into a dominant global position with the motto "Follow the Cable", setting up news outposts across the [[British Empire]] in Alexandria (1865), Bombay (1866), Melbourne (1874), Sydney (1874), and Cape Town (1876).&lt;ref name=Wenzlhuemer90 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the [[Associated Press]] became a news powerhouse, gaining a lead position through an exclusive arrangement with the [[Western Union]] company.&lt;ref name=Starr177 /&gt;

The telegraph ushered in a new global communications regime, accompanied by a restructuring of the national postal systems, and closely followed by the advent of telephone lines. With the value of international news at a premium, governments, businesses, and news agencies moved aggressively to reduce transmission times. In 1865, Reuters had the scoop on the [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln assassination]], reporting the news in England twelve days after the event took place.&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, "Trading Facts" (2011), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1866, [[Transatlantic telegraph cable|an undersea telegraph cable]] successfully connected Ireland to Newfoundland (and thus the Western Union network) cutting trans-Atlantic transmission time from days to hours.&lt;ref name="Allan, 2004 p. 17"&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Headrick | first1 = Daniel R. | last2 = Griset | first2 = Pascal | year = | title = Submarine Telegraph Cables: Business and Politics, 1838–1939 | url = | journal = Business History Review | volume = 75 | issue = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Graham Meikle, ''Interpreting News''; Palgrave Macmillan, 2009; p.

The rebels proceeded to disrupt the British telegraph network, which was rebuilt with more redundancies.&lt;ref&gt;Wenzlhuemer, ''Connecting the Nineteenth-Century World'' (2013), pp. 211–215.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902–1903, Britain and the U.S. completed the circumtelegraphy of the planet with transpacific cables from Canada to Fiji and New Zealand (British Empire), and from the US to Hawaii and the occupied Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;Hills, ''Struggle for Control of Global Communication'' (2002), pp. 145–146.&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. reassertions of the Monroe Doctrine notwithstanding, Latin America was a battleground of competing telegraphic interests until World War I, after which U.S. interests finally did consolidate their power in the hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;Hills, ''Struggle for Control of Global Communication'' (2002), pp. 153–178.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eisenbahnen- und Telegraphendichte der Erde um 1900.jpg|thumb|World railway and telegraph system, 1900]]
By the turn of the century (i.e., circa 1900), Wolff, Havas, and Reuters formed a news cartel, dividing up the global market into three sections, in which each had more-or-less exclusive distribution rights and relationships with national agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Boyd-Barrett, "'Global' News Agencies", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), pp. 26–27. "The principal feature of the world's news market in the second half of the 19th century and the first third of the 20th, was the cartel. This was an oligopolistic and hierarchical structure of the global news market controlled by Reuters, Havas and Wolff at the top tier, in partnership with an ever-increasing number of national news agencies. Each member of the triumvirate had the right to distribute its news service, incorporating news of the cartel, to its ascribed territories: these territories were determined by periodic, formal agreements. […] The triumvirate of Reuters, Havas, and Wolff supplied world news to national news agencies in return for a service of national news […] (although the practice was rather more complicated) the national agencies had exclusive rights to the distribution of cartel news in their territories, and the cartel had exclusive rights to the national agency news services."&lt;/ref&gt; Each agency's area corresponded roughly to the colonial sphere of its mother country.&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, "Trading Facts" (2011), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Reuters and the Australian national news service had an agreement to exchange news only with each other.&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, "Trading Facts" (2011), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the high cost of maintaining infrastructure, political goodwill, and global reach, newcomers found it virtually impossible to challenge the big three European agencies or the American Associated Press.&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, "Trading Facts" (2011), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890 Reuters (in partnership with the Press Association, England's major news agency for domestic stories) expanded into "soft" news stories for public consumption, about topics such as sports and "human interest".&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, "Trading Facts" (2011), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904, the big three wire services opened relations with ''Vestnik'', the news agency of Czarist Russia, to their group, though they maintained their own reporters in Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Palmer, "What Makes News", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), pp. 180–181.&lt;/ref&gt; During and after the [[Russian Revolution]], the outside agencies maintained a working relationship with the Petrograd Telegraph Agency, renamed the Russian Telegraph Agency (ROSTA) and eventually the [[TASS|Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union (TASS)]].&lt;ref name=Palmer184&gt;Michael Palmer, "What Makes News", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chinese Communist Party]] created its news agency, the Red China News Agency, in 1931; its primary responsibilities were the ''Red China'' newspaper and the internal ''Reference News''. In 1937, the Party renamed the agency ''[[Xinhua]]'', New China. Xinhua became the official news agency of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949.&lt;ref name=XinXin&gt;Xin Xin, "A developing market in news: Xinhua News Agency and Chinese newspapers"; ''Media, Culture &amp; Society'' 28.1 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

These agencies touted their ability to distill events into "minute globules of news", 20–30 word summaries which conveyed the essence of new developments.&lt;ref name=Palmer184 /&gt; Unlike newspapers, and contrary to the sentiments of some of their reporters, the agencies sought to keep their reports simple and factual.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Palmer, "What Makes News", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), pp. 182–183.&lt;/ref&gt; The wire services brought forth the "inverted pyramid" model of news copy, in which key facts appear at the start of the text, and more and more details included as it goes along.&lt;ref name="Allan, 2004 p. 17"/&gt; The sparse telegraphic writing style spilled over into newspapers, which often reprinted stories from the wire with little embellishment.&lt;ref name=MacGregor /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 20 September 1918 ''Pravda'' editorial, Lenin instructed the Soviet press to cut back on their political rambling and produce many short anticapitalist news items in "telegraph style".&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, ''Governing Soviet Journalism'' (2005), pp. 25–26. Translating Lenin: "Why instead of 200–400 lines you can't write in 20–10 lines about such simple, well-known, clear, and already mastered to a great degree, widespread phenomena like the base betrayals of the Mensheviks, those lackeys of the bourgeoisie, like the Anglo-Japanese invasion for the restoration of the holy law of capital; like the chattering teeth of the American millionaires against Germany, and so on, and so on. It is necessary to talk about this, it is necessary to register each new fact in this regard, but in a few lines; to pound out in 'telegraph style' the new appearances of old, already known and evaluated policies."&lt;/ref&gt;

As in previous eras, the news agencies provided special services to political and business clients, and these services constituted a significant portion of their operations and income. The wire services maintained close relationships with their respective national governments, which provided both press releases and payments.&lt;ref name=OBB23&gt;Boyd-Barrett, "'Global' News Agencies", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), pp. 23–24. "Earnings were generally derived from the sale of news services to media, financial or economic institutions, and governments, which were important as sources of revenue and as sources of intelligence, and it is generally considered that their news services reflected their respective national interests."&lt;/ref&gt; The acceleration and centralization of economic news facilitated regional economic integration and [[economic globalization]]. "It was the decrease in information costs and the increasing communication speed that stood at the roots of increased market integration, rather than falling transport costs by itself. In order to send goods to another area, merchants needed to know first whether in fact to send off the goods and to what place. Information costs and speed were essential for these decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, "Trading Facts" (2011), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio and television===
The [[British Broadcasting Company]] began transmitting radio news from London in 1922, dependent entirely, by law, on the British news agencies.&lt;ref name=Allen26&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; BBC radio marketed itself as a news by and for social elites, and hired only broadcasters who spoke with upper-class accents.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), p. 31. "It was quite normal for the average listener to be depicted as dressed immaculately in full evening dress, seated or standing elegantly with an expensive brand of cigarette in his hand, listening to his set. The BBC was happy to live up to this stereotype. Radio announces always arrived in evening dress, and announcers were chosen from the upper classes of English society. More importantly, they had to be able to speak the King's English just as the King spoke it."&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC gained importance in the May 1926 general strike, during which newspapers were closed and the radio served as the only source of news for an uncertain public. (To the displeasure of many listeners, the BBC took an unambiguously pro-government stance against the strikers).&lt;ref name=Allen26 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), pp. 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the USA, RCA's Radio Group established its radio network, NBC, in 1926. The Paley family founded CBS soon after. These two networks, which supplied news broadcasts to subsidiaries and affiliates, dominated the airwaves throughout the period of radio's hegemony as a news source.&lt;ref&gt;Straubhaar and LaRose, ''Communications Media in the Information Society'' (1997), pp. 177–178.&lt;/ref&gt; Radio broadcasters in the United States negotiated a similar arrangement with the press in 1933, when they agreed to use only news from the Press–Radio Bureau and eschew advertising; this agreement soon collapsed and radio stations began reporting their own news (with advertising).&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; As in Britain, American news radio avoided "controversial" topics as per norms established by the [[National Association of Broadcasters]].&lt;ref name=Allen34&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1939, 58% of Americans surveyed by ''Fortune'' considered radio news more accurate than newspapers, and 70% chose radio as their main news source.&lt;ref name=Allen34 /&gt; Radio expanded rapidly across the continent, from 30 stations in 1920 to a thousand in the 1930s. This operation was financed mostly with advertising and public relations money.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), p. 27. "Thus WEAF planted the seeds of a new business that eventually grew to envelop the broadcasting industry: advertising, public relations, and propaganda. From about 1927 this revolution was under way. Advertising agencies, manufacturers, sponsors, promoters, and the sellers of medical and life insurance were jockeying for places in a world of propaganda disseminated by radio broadcasting."&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviet Union began a major international broadcasting operation in 1929, with stations in German, English and French. The [[Nazi Party]] made use of the radio in its rise to power in Germany, with much of its propaganda focused on attacking the Soviet Bolsheviks. The British and Italian foreign radio services competed for influence in North Africa. All four of these broadcast services grew increasingly vitriolic as the European nations prepared for war.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), pp. 38–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The war provided an opportunity to expand radio and take advantage of its new potential. The BBC reported on [[Normandy landings|Allied invasion of Normandy]] on 8:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. of the morning it took place, and including a clip from German radio coverage of the same event. Listeners followed along with developments throughout the day.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. set up its [[United States Office of War Information|Office of War Information]] which by 1942 sent programming across South America, the Middle East, and East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]], a centrally located high-power station on the continent, was [[Germany Calling|seized by Germany]], and then [[Radio 1212|by the United States]]—which created fake news programs appearing as though they were created by Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), pp. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Targeting American troops in the Pacific, the Japanese government broadcast the "[[The Zero Hour (World War II)|Zero Hour]]" program, which included news from the U.S. to make the soldiers homesick.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), pp. 87–91.&lt;/ref&gt; But by the end of the war, Britain had the largest radio network in the world, broadcasting internationally in 43 different languages.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), pp. 39, 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Its scope would eventually be surpassed (by 1955) by the worldwide [[Voice of America]] programs, produced by the [[United States Information Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), pp. 108–114, 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain and the United States, television news watching rose dramatically in the 1950s and by the 1960s supplanted radio as the public's primary source of news.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 42–44.&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., television was run by the same networks which owned radio: CBS, NBC, and an NBC spin-off called ABC.&lt;ref&gt;Straubhaar and LaRose, ''Communications Media in the Information Society'' (1997), p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward R. Murrow]], who first entered the public ear as a war reporter in London, made the big leap to television to become an iconic newsman on CBS (and later the director of the United States Information Agency).&lt;ref&gt;Straubhaar and LaRose, ''Communications Media in the Information Society'' (1997), pp. 179, 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ted Turner]]'s creation of the [[Cable News Network]] (CNN) in 1980 inaugurated a new era of [[24-hour news cycle|24-hour]] satellite news broadcasting. In 1991, the BBC introduced a competitor, [[BBC World Service Television]]. Rupert Murdoch's Australian [[News Corporation]] entered the picture with [[Fox News Channel]] in the US, [[Sky News]] in Britain, and [[STAR TV]] in Asia.&lt;ref name=McNair108 /&gt; Combining this new appartus with the use of [[Embedded journalism|embedded reporters]], the United States waged the 1991–1992 [[Gulf War]] with the assistance of nonstop [[Media coverage of the Gulf War|media coverage]].&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; CNN's specialty is the [[crisis]], to which the network is prepared to shift its total attention if so chosen.&lt;ref name=HachtenCNN&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), pp. 45–48. "When a major crisis breaks out overseas, ABC, CBS, and NBC will issue news bulletins and then go back to scheduled programming and perhaps do a late-evening wrap-up, but CNN stays on the air for long stretches of time continually updating the story. The networks' version of the story will be seen in the United States; CNN's version will be seen all over the world."&lt;/ref&gt; CNN news was transmitted via [[INTELSAT]] communications satellites.&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), pp. 54–55.&lt;/ref&gt; CNN, said an executive, would bring a "town crier to the global village".&lt;ref name=Tomlinson /&gt;

In 1996, the Qatar-owned broadcaster [[Al Jazeera]] emerged as a powerful alternative to the Western media, capitalizing in part on anger in the Arab &amp; Muslim world regarding biased coverage of the Gulf War. Al Jazeera hired many news workers conveniently laid off by [[BBC Arabic Television]], which closed in April 1996. It used [[Arabsat]] to broadcast.&lt;ref name=McNair108&gt;McNair, ''Cultural Chaos'' (2006), pp. 108–114.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet===
The early internet, known as [[ARPANET]], was controlled by the U.S. Department of Defense and used mostly by academics. It became available to a wider public with the release of the [[Netscape]] browser in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;McNair, ''Cultural Chaos'' (2006), p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; At first, news websites were mostly archives of print publications.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; An early [[online newspaper]] was the ''Electronic Telegraph'', published by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.&lt;ref name=Thompson /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shane Richmond, "[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/6545788/Telegraph.co.uk-15-years-of-online-news.html Telegraph.co.uk: 15 years of online news]"; ''The Telegraph'', 11 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; A 1994 earthquake in California was one of the first big stories to be reported online in real time.&lt;ref name=Allan175&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 175–176.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, the release of web browser Netscape made news sites accessible to more people.&lt;ref name=Allan175 /&gt; On the day of the [[Oklahoma City bombing]] in April 1995, people flocked to newsgroups and chatrooms to discuss the situation and share information. The ''Oklahoma City Daily'' posted news to its site within hours. Two of the only news sites capable of hosting images, the ''San Jose Mercury News'' and ''Time'' magazine, posted photographs of the scene.&lt;ref name=Allan175 /&gt;

Quantitatively, the internet has massively expanded the sheer volume of news items available to one person. The speed of news flow to individuals has also reached a new plateau.&lt;ref&gt;McNair, ''Cultural Chaos'' (2006), pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; This insurmountable flow of news can daunt people and cause [[information overload]]. [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] called this period the "technetronic era", in which "global reality increasingly absorbs the individual, involves him, and even occasionally overwhelms him."&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In cases of government crackdowns or revolutions, the Internet has often become a major communication channel for news propagation; while it's a (relatively) simple act to shut down a newspaper, radio or television station, mobile devices such as smartphones and netbooks are much harder to detect and confiscate. The propagation of internet-capable mobile devices has also given rise to the [[citizen journalist]], who provide an additional perspective on unfolding events.

==News media today==

News can travel through different [[Media (communication)|communication media]].&lt;ref name=Globalization6 /&gt; In modern times, printed news had to be phoned into a newsroom or brought there by a [[reporter]], where it was typed and either transmitted over wire services or [[editing|edited]] and manually [[typesetting|set in type]] along with other news stories for a specific edition. Today, the term "[[breaking news]]" has become trite as [[commercial broadcasting]] [[United States cable news]] services that are available 24 hours a day use live [[communications satellite]] technology to bring current events into [[consumer]]s' homes as the event occurs. Events that used to take hours or days to become common knowledge in towns or in nations are fed instantaneously to consumers via [[radio]], [[television]], [[mobile phone]], and the [[internet]].

Speed of news transmission, of course, still varies wildly on the basis of where and how one lives.&lt;ref name=SilverblattZlobin42&gt;Silverblatt &amp; Zlobin, ''International Communications'' (2004), pp. 42–43. "In contrast, the Masai, a nomadic community of cattle raisers in Kenya, Africa, spend their lives on the move; consequently, their contact with the media is sporadic. As a result, members of the Masai community did not learn about the September 11 attack in New York until the following June."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newspaper===
[[File:NYTimes-Page1-11-11-1918.jpg|thumb|A newspaper is one of the most common ways to receive the latest news.]]
{{Main|Newspaper}}
Most large cities in the United States historically had morning and afternoon newspapers. With the addition of new communications media, afternoon newspapers have shut down and morning newspapers have lost circulation. Weekly newspapers have somewhat increased.&lt;ref&gt;Straubhaar and LaRose, ''Communications Media in the Information Society'' (1997), pp. 158–159.&lt;/ref&gt; In more and more cities, newspapers have established local market monopolies—i.e., a single newspaper is the only one in town. This process has accelerated since the 1980s, commensurate with a general trend of [[consolidation of media ownership|consolidation in media ownership]].&lt;ref&gt;Straubhaar and LaRose, ''Communications Media in the Information Society'' (1997), pp. 163–164.&lt;/ref&gt; In China, too, newspapers have gained exclusive status, city-by-city, and pooled into large associations such as Chengdu Business News. These associations function like news agencies, challenging the hegemony of Xinhua as a news provider.&lt;ref name=XinXin /&gt;

The world's top three [[List of newspapers in the world by circulation|most circulated newspapers]] all publish from Japan.

About one-third of newspaper revenue comes from sales; the majority comes from advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Newspapers have struggled to maintain revenue given declining circulation and the free flow of information over the internet; some have implemented [[paywall]]s for their websites.&lt;ref name=Thompson /&gt;

In the U.S., many newspapers have shifted their operations online, publishing around the clock rather than daily in order to keep pace with the internet society. Prognosticators have suggested that print newspapers will vanish from the U.S. in 5–20 years.&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;Shelley Thompson, "The Future of Newspapers in a Digital Age", in Fowler-Watt &amp; Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Many newspapers have started to track social media engagement for trending news stories to cover. Spain's [[Público (Spain)|Público]] has [https://ijnet.org/en/blog/how-spains-p%C3%BAblico-redefined-its-strategy-and-grew-its-audience-40-percent reshaped their social media strategy and grew their audience by 40 %].

===Television===
Internationally distributed news channels include [[BBC News]], [[CNN]], [[Fox News]], [[MSNBC]], and [[Sky News]]. Televisions are densely concentrated in the United States (98% of households), and the average American watches 4 hours of television programming each day. In other parts of the world, such as Kenya—especially rural areas without much electricity—televisions are rare.&lt;ref name=SilverblattZlobin42 /&gt;

The largest supplier of international video news is Reuters TV, with 409 subscribers in 83 countries, 38 bureaus, and a reported audience of 1.5 billion people each day. The other major video news service is [[Associated Press Television News]]. These two major agencies have agreements to exchange video news with ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, and [[Eurovision (network)|Eurovision]]—itself a sizeable video news exchange.&lt;ref name=Hachten39&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), pp. 39–41.&lt;/ref&gt; [[CNN International]] is a notable broadcaster in times of crisis.&lt;ref name=HachtenCNN /&gt;

===Internet===
[[Online journalism]] is news that is reported on the [[internet]]. News can be delivered more quickly through this method of news as well as accessed more easily. The internet era has transformed the understanding of news. Because the internet allows communication which is not only instantaneous, but also bi- or multi-directional, it has blurred the boundaries of who is a legitimate news producer. A common type of internet journalism is called [[blogging]], which is a service of persistently written articles uploaded and written by one or more individuals. Millions of people in countries such as the United States and South Korea have taken up blogging. Many blogs have rather small audiences; some blogs are read by millions each month.&lt;ref&gt;McNair, ''Cultural Chaos'' (2006), pp. 124–133.&lt;/ref&gt; Social media sites, especially Twitter and Facebook, have become an important source of breaking news information and for disseminating links to news websites. Twitter declared in 2012: "It's like being delivered a newspaper whose headlines you'll always find interesting—you can discover news as it's happening, learn more about topics that are important to you, and get the inside scoop in real time."&lt;ref&gt;Einar Thorsen, "Live Blogging and Social Media Curation: Challenges and Opportunities for Journalism", in Fowler-Watt &amp; Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Cell phone cameras have normalized citizen [[photojournalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Caitlin Patrick &amp; Stuart Allan, "'The Camera as Witness: The Changing Nature of Photojournalism", in Fowler-Watt &amp; Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Schudson]], professor at the [[Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism]], has said that "[e]verything we thought we once knew about journalism needs to be rethought in the Digital Age."&lt;ref name="Schudson 2011 205"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schudson|first=Michael|title=The Sociology of News (2nd edition)|year=2011|page=205|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PK3tgAEACAAJ|isbn=978-0393912876}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today the work of journalism can be done from anywhere and done well. It requires no more than a reporter and a laptop. In that way, journalistic authority seems to have become more individual- and less institution-based. But does the individual reporter always have to be an actual journalist? Or can journalistic work be done from anywhere and by anyone? These are questions that refer to the core of journalistic practice and the definition of "news" itself. As Schudson has given emphasis to, the answer is not easily found; "the ground journalists walk upon is shaking, and the experience for both those who work in the field and those on the outside studying it is dizzying".&lt;ref name="Schudson 2011 205"/&gt;

Schudson has identified the following six specific areas where the ecology of news in his opinion has changed:
* The line between the reader and writer has blurred.
* The distinction among tweet, blog post, Facebook, newspaper story, magazine article, and book has blurred.
* The line between professionals and amateurs has blurred, and a variety of "pro-am" relationships has emerged.
* The boundaries delineating for-profit, public, and non-profit media have blurred, and the cooperation across these models of financing has developed.
* Within commercial news organizations, the line between the news room and the business office has blurred.
* The line between old media and new media has blurred, practically beyond recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schudson|first=Michael|title=The Sociology of News (2nd edition)|year=2011|pages=207–216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These alterations inevitably have fundamental ramifications for the contemporary ecology of news. "The boundaries of journalism, which just a few years ago seemed relatively clear, and permanent, have become less distinct, and this blurring, while potentially the foundation of progress even as it is the source of risk, has given rise to a new set of journalistic principles and practices",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schudson|first=Michael|title=The Sociology of News (2nd edition)|year=2011|page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schudson puts it. It is indeed complex, but it seems to be the future.

Online news has also changed the geographic reach of individual news stories, diffusing readership from city-by-city markets to a potentially global audience.&lt;ref name=Thompson /&gt;

The growth of social media networks have also created new opportunities for automated and efficient news gathering for journalists and newsrooms. Many newsrooms (broadcasters, newspapers, magazines, radio and TV) have started to perform [https://ezyinsights.com/best-practices-in-news-gathering/ news gathering on social media platforms]. Social media is creating changes in the consumer behaviour and news consumption. According to a [http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/06/12/growth-in-mobile-news-use-driven-by-older-adults/ study by Pew Research], a large portion of Americans read news on digital and on mobile devices.

Because internet does not have the "column inches" limitation of print media, online news stories can, but don't always, come bundled with supplementary material. The medium of the [[world wide web]] also enables [[hyperlinking]], which allows readers to navigate to other pages related to the one they're reading.&lt;ref name=Thompson /&gt;

Despite these changes, some studies have concluded that internet news coverage remains fairly homogenous and dominated by news agencies.&lt;ref name=Watanabe2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Paterson2006&gt;Chris Paterson, "News Agency Dominance in International news on the Internet", ''Papers in International and Global Communication'' 01/06 (Center for International Communications Research), May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; And journalists working with online media do not identify significantly different criteria for newsworthiness than print journalists.&lt;ref name=SKH /&gt;

==News agencies==
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F079071-0007, Bonn, Nachrichtenagentur Reuters.jpg|thumb|Reuters office in Bonn, Germany, 1988]]
News agencies are services which compile news and disseminate it in bulk. Because they disseminate information to a wide variety of clients, who repackage the material as news for public consumption, news agencies tend to use less controversial language in their reports. Despite their importance, news agencies are not well known by the general public. They keep low profiles and their reporters usually do not get bylines.&lt;ref name=MacGregor /&gt;&lt;ref name=JohnstonForde&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Johnston | first1 = Jane | last2 = Forde | first2 = Susan | title = "The Silent Partner: News Agencies and 21st Century News"; | url = | journal = International Journal of Communication | volume = 5 | issue = | year = 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest [[news agency]] still operating is the [[Agence France-Presse]] (AFP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Broderick |first=James F. |authorlink= |author2=Darren W. Miller  |editor= |others= |title=Consider the source: A Critical Guide to 100 Prominent News and Information Sites on the Web |origyear= |edition= |series= |year=2007 |publisher=Information Today, Inc. |location= |language= |isbn=978-0910965774 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page=1 |chapter= |url= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 1835 by a Parisian translator and [[Advertising agency|advertising agent]], [[Charles-Louis Havas]] as [[Agence Havas]]. By the end of the twentieth century, [[Reuters]] far outpaced the other news agencies in profits, and became one of the largest companies in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), p. 2; Oliver Boyd-Barrett, "'Global' News Agencies", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Thomson Reuters employed more than 55,000 people in 100 countries, and posted an annual revenue of $12.9 billion.&lt;ref name=MacGregor /&gt;

[[United Press International]] gained prominence as a world news agency in the middle of the twentieth century, but shrank in the 1980s and was sold off at low prices. It is owned by the [[Unification Church]] company [[News World Communications]].

News agencies, especially Reuters and the newly important [[Bloomberg News]], convey both news stories for mass audiences and financial information of interest to businesses and investors.&lt;ref name=OBB21 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ewha&gt;John Bartram Ewha, "News Agency Wars: the battle between Reuters and Bloomberg"; ''Journalism Studies'' 4.3 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Bloomberg LP, a private company founded by [[Michael Bloomberg]] in 1981, made rapid advances with computerized stock market reporting updated in real time. Its news service continued to exploit this electronic advantage by combining computer-generated analytics with text reporting. Bloomberg linked with Agence France Presse in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=Ewha /&gt;

Following the marketization of the Chinese economy and the media boom of the 1990s, [[Xinhua]] has adopted some commercial practices including subscription fees, but it remains government-subsidized. It provides newswire, news photos, economic information, and audio and video news. Xinhua has a growing number of subscribers, totaling 16,969 in 2002, including 93% of Chinese newspapers.&lt;ref name=XinXin /&gt; It operates 123 foreign bureaus and produces 300 news stories each day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hong | first1 = Junhao | title = "From the World's Largest Propaganda Machine to a Multipurposed Global News Agency: Factors in and Implications of Xinhua's Transformation Since 1978"; | url = | journal = Political Communication | volume = 28 | issue = | year = 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other agencies with considerable reach include [[Deutsche Presse-Agentur]] (Germany), [[Kyodo News]] (Japan), the ''[[Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata]]'' (Italy), the [[Middle East News Agency]] (Egypt), [[Tanjug]] (Serbia), [[EFE]] (Spain), and [[Anadolu Agency]] (Turkey).&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the internet, [[news aggregators]] play a role similar to that of the news agency—and, because of the sources they select, tend to transmit news stories which originate from the main agencies. Of articles displayed by [[Yahoo! News]] in the U.S., 91.7% come from news agencies: 39.4% from AP, 30.9% AFP, and 21.3% Reuters. In India, 60.1% of Yahoo! News stories come from Reuters. [[Google News]] relies somewhat less on news agencies, and has shown high volatility, in the sense of focusing heavily on the most recent handful of salient world events.&lt;ref name=Watanabe2013 /&gt; In 2010, Google News redesigned its front page with automatic geotargeting, which generated a selection of local news items for every viewer.&lt;ref&gt;Lisa M. George &amp; Christiaan Hogendorn, "[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2357586 Local News Online: Aggregators, Geo-Targeting and the Market for Local News]"; November 1, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global news system==
In the 20th century, global news coverage was dominated by a combination of the "Big Four" news agencies—Reuters, Associated Press, Agence France Press, and United Press International—representing the [[Western bloc]], and the Communist agencies: [[Russian News Agency "TASS"|TASS]] from the Soviet Union, and [[Xinhua]] from China.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of major world events, and analyses of all international news coverage in various newspapers, consistently found that a large majority of news items originated from the four biggest wire services.&lt;ref name=Watanabe2013&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Watanabe | first1 = Kohei | title = The western perspective in Yahoo! News and Google News: Quantitative analysis of geographic coverage of online news | url = | journal = International Communication Gazette | volume = 75 | issue = 2| year = 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Television news agencies include [[Associated Press Television News]], which bought and incorporated World Television News; and Reuters Television.&lt;ref name=Hachten39 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Boyd-Barrett, "'Global' News Agencies", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Bloomberg News created in the 1990s, expanded rapidly to become a player in the realm of international news.&lt;ref name=OBB21&gt;Oliver Boyd-Barrett, "'Global' News Agencies", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), p. 21. "Bloomberg's influence is greater than the number of its terminals may suggest, as it feeds financial data and economic news through the AP network to AP members and clients in the United States, and to many national networks through national news agencies. Indeed, it boasts having the second largest 'wholesale' news distribution in the United States, after AP&gt; It has print, radio and television distribution in many countries: Bloomberg television is distributed via Astra satellite service in Europe."&lt;/ref&gt; The Associated Press also maintains a radio network with thousands of subscribers worldwide; it is the sole provider of international news to many small stations.&lt;ref name=Hachten39 /&gt;

By some accounts, dating back to the 1940s, the increasing interconnectedness of the news system has accelerated the pace of [[History of the world|world history]] itself.&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), p. 7. "Since World War II, an intricate an worldwide network of international news media has evolved, providing an expanded capability for information flows. This relationship between the capacity and the need to communicate rapidly has resulted from the interaction of two long-term historical processes: the evolution toward a single global society and the movement of civilization beyond four great benchmarks of human communication—speech, writing, printing, electronic communications (telephone and radio)—into a fifth era of long-distance instant communication based on telecommunications (mainly satellites) and computer technology. Harold Lasswell believed that the mass media revolution has accelerated the tempo and direction of world history. What would have happened later has happened sooner, and changes in timing may have modified substantive developments."&lt;/ref&gt;

===New World Information and Communication Order===
The global news system is dominated by agencies from Europe and the United States, and reflects their interests and priorities in its coverage.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Boyd-Barrett, "'Global' News Agencies", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Euro-American control of the global news system has led to criticism; that events around the world are constantly compared to events like the [[Holocaust]] and [[World War Two]] which are considered foundational in the West.&lt;ref name=Zeiler31&gt;Barbie Zeiler, "Cannibalizing Memory in the Global Flow of News"; in ''On Media Memory'' (2011), ed. Neiger, Myers, &amp; Zandberg; pp. 31–34.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1960s, a significant amount of news reporting from the Third World has been characterized by some form "development journalism", a paradigm which focuses on long-term development projects, social change, and nation-building.&lt;ref&gt;Fosu, "The Press and Political Participation" (2014), pp. 67–73.&lt;/ref&gt; When in 1987 the U.S. media reported on a riot in the Dominican Republic—the first major news item regarding that country in years—the resulting decline in tourism lasted for years and had a noticeable effect on the economy.&lt;ref&gt;Straubhaar and LaRose, ''Communications Media in the Information Society'' (1997), pp. 124–125.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[English language]] predominates in global news exchanges.&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), pp. 100–102.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have accused the global news system of perpetuating [[cultural imperialism]].&lt;ref name=Tomlinson&gt;John Tomlinson, "Cultural Globalization and Cultural Imperialism", in Mohammadi (ed.), ''International Communication and Globalization (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SilverblattZlobin28 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McNair, ''Cultural Chaos'' (2006), pp. 105–108.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics further charge that the Western media conglomerates maintain a bias towards the status quo economic order, especially a pro-corporate bias.&lt;ref name=SilverblattZlobin28 /&gt;

The [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) has promoted a [[New World Information and Communication Order]], which envisions an international news exchange system involving national news agencies in every country. UNESCO encouraged the new states formed from colonial territories in the 1960s to establish news agencies, to generate domestic news stories, exchange news items with international partners, and disseminate both types of news internally.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), p. 8. "The UN, through UNESCO, consistently endeavored to encourage the spread and development of national news agencies, and of news-exchange arrangements between them, especially during the great wave of independence in Africa during the 1960s. Setting up a national news agency became one of the essential things, part of the 'script', of what it meant to be a 'nation'. Through a national news agency, a state could lay down information links domestically and internationally which would facilitate the generation and exchange of news."&lt;/ref&gt; Along these lines, the 1980 [[MacBride report]], "Many Voices, One World", called for an interdependent global news system with more participation from different governments. To this end, also, UNESCO formed the [[Non-Aligned News Agencies Pool]].&lt;ref&gt;Chakravartty and Sarikakis, ''Media Policy and Globalization'' (2006), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Inter Press Service]], founded in 1964, has served as an intermediary for Third World press agencies.&lt;ref&gt;C. Anthony Giffard, "Alternative News Agencies", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; Inter Press Service's editorial policy favors coverage of events, institutions, and issues which relate to inequality, [[economic development]], [[economic integration]], natural resources, population, health, education, and [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref name=Giffard194&gt;C. Anthony Giffard, "Alternative News Agencies", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), pp. 192–194.&lt;/ref&gt; It gives less coverage than other agencies to crime, disasters, and violence. Geographically, 70% of its news reporting concerns Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;C. Anthony Giffard, "Alternative News Agencies", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), pp. 195–196.&lt;/ref&gt; IPS has the most subscribers in Latin America and southern Africa.&lt;ref name=Giffard194 /&gt; IPS receives grants from organizations such as the [[United Nations Development Program]] and other United Nations agencies, [[Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung]], [[Federatie Nederlandse Vakbeweging]], the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Graz-Seckau|Diocese of Graz]], the [[Charles Stewart Mott Foundation]], the [[Ford Foundation]], the [[MacArthur Foundation]], and the [[W. Alton Jones Foundation]] to report news on chosen topics, including the environment, sustainable development, and women's issues.&lt;ref&gt;C. Anthony Giffard, "Alternative News Agencies", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), pp. 196–197.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 1960s, the [[United States Agency for International Development]], the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]], and UNESCO developed the use of satellite television for international broadcasting. In India, 1975–1976, these agencies implemented an experimental satellite television system, called the [[Satellite Instructional Television Experiment]], with assistance from the [[Indian Space Research Organisation]], and [[All India Radio]].&lt;ref&gt;Chakravartty and Sarikakis, ''Media Policy and Globalization'' (2006), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further transformation in global news flow===
By the 1980s, much of the Third World had succumbed to a [[Latin American debt crisis|debt crisis]] resulting from unrepayably large loans accumulated since the 1960s. At this point, the [[World Bank]] took an active role in the governance of many countries, and its authority extended to communications policy. The policy of developing Third World media gave way to a global regime of [[free trade]] institutions like the [[World Trade Organization]], which also protected the free flow of information across borders.&lt;ref&gt;Chakravartty and Sarikakis, ''Media Policy and Globalization'' (2006), pp. 33–38.&lt;/ref&gt; The World Bank also promoted privatization of national telecommunications, which afforded large multinational corporations the opportunity to purchase networks and expand operations in the Third World.&lt;ref&gt;Chakravartty and Sarikakis, ''Media Policy and Globalization'' (2006), pp. 58–72, 133–136. "In almost all cases, a combination of privatization schemes and higher rates of public investment led to double-digit growth in teledensity figures throughout the 1990s and continuing today (see Table 3.3). Private telecommunications operators were drawn to emerging markets like Brazil, China, and India, among others, because technological innovation coupled with policy reforms promised access to lucrative high-density business and urban middle-class consumers. […] The few comparative studies of telecommunications reform in the South show that the political environment—whether the state is responsive to democratic public interest—\and its relative power vis-à-vis foreign capital and G8 nations have shaped the terms of reform."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ali Mohammadi, "Communication and the Globalizing Process in the Developing World", in Mohammadi (ed.), ''International Communication and Globalization (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

In countries with less telecommunications infrastructure, people, especially youth, tend today to get their news predominantly from mobile phones and, less so, from the internet. Older folks listen more to the radio. The government of China is a major investor in Third World telecommunications, especially in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Geniets, ''Global News Challenge'' (2013), pp. 22–27.&lt;/ref&gt; Some issues relating to global information flow were revisited in light of the internet at the 2003/2005 [[World Summit on the Information Society]], a conference which emphasized the role of civil society and the private sector in [[information society]] governance.&lt;ref&gt;Chakravartty and Sarikakis, ''Media Policy and Globalization'' (2006), pp. 136–143.&lt;/ref&gt;

==News values==
{{Journalism sidebar}}

[[News values]] are the professional norms of [[journalism]]. Commonly, news content should contain all the "[[Five Ws]]" (who, what, when, where, why, and also how) of an event. Newspapers normally place hard news stories on the first pages, so the most important information is at the beginning, enabling busy readers to read as little or as much as they desire. Local stations and networks with a set format must take news stories and break them down into the most important aspects due to time constraints.

Journalists are often expected to aim for [[objectivity (journalism)|objectivity]]; reporters claim to try to cover all sides of an issue without bias, as compared to commentators or analysts, who provide [[opinion]] or personal points of view. The resulting articles lay out facts in a sterile, noncommittal manner, standing back to "let the reader decide" the truth of the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/~pmeyer/ire95pj.htm |title=Public Journalism and the Problem of Objectivity |publisher=Unc.edu |accessdate=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several governments impose certain constraints against bias. In the [[United Kingdom]], the government agency of [[Ofcom]] (Office of Communications) enforces a legal requirement of "impartiality" on news broadcasters.&lt;ref name=Wallace&gt;Sue Wallace, "Impartiality in the News", in Fowler-Watt &amp; Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Both newspapers and broadcast news programs in the United States are generally expected to remain neutral and avoid bias except for clearly indicated editorial articles or segments. Many single-party governments have operated state-run news organizations, which may present the government's views.

Mid-twentieth-century news reporting in the United States focused on political and local issues with important socio-economic impacts, such as the landing of a living person on the moon or the cold war. The focus similarly remains on political and local issues; the news [[mass media]] now comes under criticism for over-emphasis on "non-news" and "gossip" such as celebrities' personal social issues, local issues of little merit, as well as biased sensationalism of political topics such as terrorism and the economy. The dominance of celebrity and social news, the blurring of the boundary between news and reality shows and other popular culture, and the advent of citizen journalism may suggest that the nature of 'news' and news values are evolving and that traditional models of the news process are now only partially relevant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.owenspencer-thomas.com/journalism/newsvalues] News Values. URL Retrieved June 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Newsworthiness does not only depend on the topic, but also the presentation of the topic and the selection of information from that topic.

Although newswriters have always laid claim to truth and objectivity, the modern values of professional journalism were established beginning in the late 1800s and especially after World War I, when groups like the [[American Society of Newspaper Editors]] codified rules for unbiased news reporting. These norms held the most sway in American and British journalism, and were scorned by some other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 20–23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Matheson | first1 = Donald | title = "The birth of news discourse: changes in news language in British newspapers, 1880–1930"; | url = | journal = Media, Culture &amp; Society | volume = 22 | issue = | year= 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas have become part of the practice of journalism across the world.&lt;ref&gt;Zhong, "Searching for Meaning" (2006), pp. 15, 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Soviet commentators said stories in the Western press were trivial distractions from reality, and emphasized a [[socialist realism]] model focusing on developments in everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, ''Governing Soviet Journalism'' (2005), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even in those situations where objectivity is expected, it is difficult to achieve, and individual journalists may fall foul of their own personal bias, or succumb to [[Media bias|commercial or political pressure]]. Similarly, the objectivity of news organizations owned by conglomerated corporations fairly may be questioned, in light of the natural incentive for such groups to report news in a manner intended to advance the conglomerate's financial interests. Individuals and organizations who are the subject of news reports may use [[news management]] techniques to try to make a favourable impression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=Helen|title=Watchdogs of Democracy?: The Waning Washington Press Corps and How It Has Failed the Public|chapter=Spinning the News|year=2006|page=57|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=lixOlrqPeqoC|isbn=978-1416548614|publisher=Simon and Schuster}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because each individual has a particular point of view, it is recognized that there can be no absolute objectivity in news reporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cjr.org/feature/rethinking_objectivity.php?page=all |title=Re-thinking Objectivity |publisher=CJR |accessdate=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists can collectively shift their opinion over what is a controversy up for debate and what is an established fact, as evidenced by homogenization during the 2000s of news coverage of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;Sara Shipley Hiles &amp; Amanda Hinnart, "Climate Change in the Newsroom: Journalists' Evolving Standards of Objectivity When Covering Global Warming"; ''Science Communication 36.4, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators on news values have argued that journalists' training in news values ''itself'' represents a systemic bias of the news. The norm of objectivity leads journalists to gravitate towards certain types of acts and exclude others. A journalist can be sure of objectivity in reporting that an official or public figure has made a certain statement. This is one reason why so much news reporting is devoted to official statements.&lt;ref&gt;John Soloski, "News Reporting and Professionalism: Some Constraints on Reporting the News", from ''Media, Culture &amp; Society'' 11 (1989); reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), pp. 143–145.&lt;/ref&gt; This lemma dates back to the early history of public news reporting, as exemplified by an English printer who on 12 March 1624 published news from Brussels in the form of letters, with the prefacing comment: "Now because you shall not say, that either out of my owne conceit I misliked a phrase, or presumptuously tooke upon me to reforme any thing amisse, I will truly set you downe their owne words."&lt;ref&gt;Cranfield, ''Press and Society'' (1978), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Strong objectivity|Feminist critiques]] argue that discourse defined as objective by news organizations reflects a male-centered perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; In their selection of sources, journalists rely heavily on men as sources of authoritative- and objective-seeming statements.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; News reporting has also tended to discuss women differently, usually in terms of appearance and relationship to men.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 134–135.&lt;/ref&gt;

The critique of traditional norms of objectivity comes from within news organizations as well. Said Peter Horrocks, head of television news at BBC: "The days of middle-of-the-road, balancing Left and Right, impartiality are dead. […] we need to consider adopting what I like to think of as a much wider 'radical impartiality'—the need to hear the widest range of views—all sides of the story."&lt;ref name=Wallace /&gt;

==Social organization of news production==
===News organizations===
Viewed from a [[sociology of knowledge|sociological perspective]], news for mass consumption is produced in hierarchical organizations. Reporters, working near the bottom of the structure, are given significant autonomy in researching and preparing reports, subject to assignments and occasional intervention from higher decision-makers.&lt;ref&gt;James S. Ettema, D. Charles Whitney, &amp; Daniel B. Wackman, in ''Handbook of Communications Science'' (1987), ed. C.H. Berger &amp; S.H. Chaffee; reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Owners at the top of the news hierarchy influence the content of news indirectly but substantially. The professional norms of journalism discourage overt censorship; however, news organizations have covert but firm norms about how to cover certain topics. These policies are conveyed to journalists through socialization on the job; without any written policy, they simply learn how things are done.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Breed, "Social Control in the Newsroom: A Functional Analysis" ([https://umdrive.memphis.edu/cbrown14/public/Mass%20Comm%20Theory/Week%208%20Journalism%20Studies/Breed%201955.pdf pdf]), from ''Social Forces'' 33 (1955); reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), pp. 108–110.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Soloski, "News Reporting and Professionalism: Some Constraints on Reporting the News", from ''Media, Culture &amp; Society'' 11 (1989); reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), pp. 139–140, 146–152. "One method management could use to control its journalists would be to establish rules and regulations. This bureaucratic form would not be very efficient […] A more efficient method for controlling behavior in nonbureaucratic organizations, such as news organizations, is through professionalism. Professionalism "''makes the use of discretion predictable.'' It relieves bureaucratic organizations of responsibility for devising their own mechanisms of control in the discretionary areas of work (Larson, 1977: 168) (emphasis in original)."&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists comply with these rules for various reasons, including job security.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Breed, "Social Control in the Newsroom: A Functional Analysis" ([https://umdrive.memphis.edu/cbrown14/public/Mass%20Comm%20Theory/Week%208%20Journalism%20Studies/Breed%201955.pdf pdf]), from ''Social Forces'' 33 (1955); reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), pp. 111–114.&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists are also systematically influenced by their education, including [[journalism school]].&lt;ref&gt;John Soloski, "News Reporting and Professionalism: Some Constraints on Reporting the News", from ''Media, Culture &amp; Society'' 11 (1989); reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), pp. 141–142.&lt;/ref&gt;

News production is routinized in several ways. News stories use familiar formats and subgenres which vary by topic. "Rituals of objectivity", such as pairing a quotation from one group with a quotation from a competing group, dictate the construction of most news narratives. Many news items revolve around periodic press conferences or other scheduled events. Further routine is established by assigning each journalist to a [[Beat reporting|beat]]: a domain of human affairs, usually involving government or commerce, in which certain types of events routinely occur.&lt;ref&gt;James S. Ettema, D. Charles Whitney, &amp; Daniel B. Wackman, in ''Handbook of Communications Science'' (1987), ed. C.H. Berger &amp; S.H. Chaffee; reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

A common scholarly frame for understanding news production is to examine the role of information [[Gatekeeping (communication)|gatekeepers]]: to ask why and how certain narratives make their way from news producers to news consumers.&lt;ref&gt;Pamela J. Shoemaker, "A New Gatekeeping Model", from ''Gatekeeping'' (1991); reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), p. 57. "Simply put, gatekeeping is the process by which the billions of messages that are available in the world get cut down and transformed into hundreds of messages that reach a given person on a given day."&lt;/ref&gt; Obvious gatekeepers include journalists, news agency staff, and wire editors of newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;David Manning White, "The 'Gate Keeper': A Case Study in the Selection of News", from ''Journalism Quarterly'' 27 (1950); reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Ideology, personal preferences, source of news, and length of a story are among the many considerations which influence gatekeepers.&lt;ref&gt;David Manning White, "The 'Gate Keeper': A Case Study in the Selection of News", from ''Journalism Quarterly'' 27 (1950); reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), pp. 66–71.&lt;/ref&gt; Although social media have changed the structure of news dissemination, gatekeeper effects may continue due to the role of a few central nodes in the social network.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas John Erneste, "Toward a Networked Gatekeeping Theory: Journalism, News Diffusion, and Democracy in a Networked Model"; Dissertation accepted at University of Minnesota, January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

New factors have emerged in internet-era newsrooms. One issue is "click-thinking", the editorial selection of news stories—and of journalists—who can generate the most website hits and thus advertising revenue. Unlike a newspaper, a news website has detailed data collection about which stories are popular and who is reading them.&lt;ref name=JohnstonForde /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An Nguyen, "Online News Audiences: The challenges of web metrics", in Fowler-Watt &amp; Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; The drive for speedy online postings, some journalists have acknowledged, has altered norms of fact-checking so that verification takes place after publication.&lt;ref name=JohnstonForde /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Redden, "[http://research.gold.ac.uk/6540/ The Mediation of Poverty: The News, New Media and Politics]"; Dissertation accepted at Goldsmiths, University of London, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalists' sometimes unattributed echoing of other news sources can also increase the homogeneity of news feeds.&lt;ref name=Matthews /&gt; The digital age can accelerate the problem of [[circular reporting]]: propagation of the same error through increasingly reliable sources. In 2009, a number of journalists were embarrassed after all reproducing a fictional quotation, originating from Wikipedia.&lt;ref name=Matthews /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Timmer, "[https://arstechnica.com/science/2009/05/wikipedia-hoax-reveals-limits-of-journalists-research/ Wikipedia hoax points to limits of journalists' research: A sociology student placed a fake quote on Wikipedia, only to see it show up …]"; ''Ars Technica'', 7 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

News organizations have historically been male-dominated, though women have acted as journalists since at least the 1880s. The number of female journalists has increased over time, but organizational hierarchies remain controlled mostly by men.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 119–121.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of British news organizations estimate that more than 80% of decision-makers are men.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar studies have found '[[Old boy network|old boys' networks]]' in control of news organizations in the United States and the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 127–129.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, newsrooms tend to divide journalists by gender, assigning men to "hard" topics like military, crime, and economics, and women to "soft", "humanised" topics.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 129–130.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship with institutions===
For various reasons, news media usually have a close relationship with the state, and often church as well, even when they cast themselves in critical roles.&lt;ref name=Fang14 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Stephens27 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Salmon90&gt;Salmon, ''The Newspaper and the Historian'' (1923), pp. 90–91.&lt;/ref&gt; This relationship seems to emerge because the press can develop symbiotic relationships with other powerful social institutions.&lt;ref name=Salmon90 /&gt; In the United States, the [[Associated Press]] wire service developed a "bilateral monopoly" with the [[Western Union]] telegraph company.&lt;ref name=Starr177&gt;Starr, ''Creation of the Media'' (2004), pp. 175–177.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Annteresa Lubrano, ''The Telegraph: How Technology Innovation Caused Social Change''; New York: Garland, 1997; pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=IVWAAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA72 72]–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

The news agencies which rose to power in the mid-1800s all had support from their respective governments, and in turn served their political interests to some degree.&lt;ref name=OBB23 /&gt; News for consumption has operated under [[Statism|statist]] assumptions, even when it takes a stance adversarial to some aspect of a government.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 5. "Free of an extended view of the history of press-government relations, it is easy to maintain a romantic image of the journalist, when unchained by repressive regulation, as a staunch adversary of government; it is easy to overlook the basic pro-authoritarian role that has been played by those who spread news: their success in occupying the minds of the governed with a belief in the importance, if not the inevitabiltiy, of a system of government."&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, a large proportion of routine news production involves interactions between reporters and government officials.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Schudson, "The Sociology of News Production", from ''Media, Culture &amp; Society'' (1989); reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), p. 14. "One study after another comes up with essentially the same observation, and it matters not whether the study is at the national, state, or local level—the story of journalism, on a day-to-day basis, is the story of the interaction of reporters and officials."&lt;/ref&gt; Relatedly, journalists tend to adopt a hierarchical view of society, according to which a few people at the top of organizational pyramids are best situated to comment on the reality which serves as the basisi of news.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 62–63. "To clarify, H.S. Becker (1967) employs the notion of a 'hierarchy of credibility' to specify how, in a system of ranked groups, participants will take it as given that the members of the highest group are best placed to define 'the way things really are' due to their 'knowledge of truth'. Implicit in this assumption is the view that 'those at the top' will have access to a more complete picture of the bureaucratic organization's workings than members of lower groups whose definition of reality, because of this subordinate status, can only be partial and distorted."&lt;/ref&gt; Broadly speaking, therefore, news tends to normalize and reflect the interests of the power structure dominant in its social context.&lt;ref&gt;James S. Ettema, D. Charles Whitney, &amp; Daniel B. Wackman, in ''Handbook of Communications Science'' (1987), ed. C.H. Berger &amp; S.H. Chaffee; reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), pp. 34–37. "In sum, a considerable body of research supports the argument that inter-organizational- and institutional-level forces, realized in a journalistic culture of 'objectivity,' fostered by, and in the service of, progressive liberal capitalism, constrain what journalists report. News thus exhibits an identifiable and widely shared form and a content broadly consonant with the social structures and values of its political-economic context."&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) rival and may surpass governments in their influence on the content of news.&lt;ref name=VanLeuvenJoye&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van Leuven | first1 = Sarah | last2 = Joye | first2 = Stijn | title = "Civil Society Organizations at the Gates?

===State control===
{{Main|State media}}

Governments use international news transmissions to promote the national interest and conduct [[political warfare]], alternatively known as [[public diplomacy]] and, in the modern era, [[international broadcasting]]. International radio broadcasting came into wide-ranging use by world powers seeking cultural integration of their empires.&lt;ref&gt;Geniets, ''Global News Challenge'' (2013), pp. 4–6, 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The British government used BBC radio as a diplomatic tool, setting up Arabic, Spanish and Portuguese services in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; American propaganda broadcasters include [[Voice of America]] and [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]], [[Crusade for Freedom|set up during the Cold War]] and still operating today.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), pp. 177–182.&lt;/ref&gt; The United States remains the world's top broadcaster, although by some accounts it was surpassed for a time circa 1980 [[Radio Moscow|by the Soviet Union]]. Other major international broadcasters include the People's Republic of China, Taiwan, Germany, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, North Korea, India, Cuba, and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), pp. 129–133, 132, 206–207.&lt;/ref&gt; Around the world (and especially, formerly, in the Soviet bloc), international news sources such as the [[BBC World Service]] are often welcomed as alternatives to domestic state-run media.&lt;ref&gt;Geniets, ''Global News Challenge'' (2013), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), pp. 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Governments have also funneled programming through private news organizations, as when the British government arranged to insert news into the Reuters feed during and after World War Two.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), pp. 21, 55. "The Reuters news service would be broadcast from Rugby with an insertion written by the Foreign Office. The secret agreement provided that both Leafield and Rugby Radio would carry 720 000 words per year, at a cost of three and a half pence per word. During and after the Second World War, these two radio stations transmitted news whose content had been falsified with the intention of deceiving the enemy."&lt;/ref&gt; Past revelations have suggested that the U.S. military and intelligence agencies create news stories which they disseminate secretly into the foreign and domestic media. Investigation into the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] pursued in the 1970s found that it owned hundreds of news organizations (wire services, newspapers, magazines) outright.&lt;ref&gt;Parenti, ''Inventing Reality'' (1993), pp. 66–68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), pp. 116–118.&lt;/ref&gt; Soviet news warfare also involved the creation of front groups, like the [[International Organization of Journalists]]. The Russian [[KGB]] heavily pursued a strategy of [[disinformation]], planting false stories which made their way to news outlets worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), pp. 113–116.&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadcasts into Iraq before the [[Gulf War|Second Gulf War]] mimicked the style of local programming.&lt;ref&gt;Silverblatt &amp; Zlobin, ''International Communications'' (2004), p. 49; also see&lt;/ref&gt; The US also launched Middle East Broadcasting Networks, featuring the satellite TV station [[Alhurra]] and radio station [[Radio Sawa]] to beam 24-hour programming to Iraq and environs.&lt;ref&gt;Silverblatt &amp; Zlobin, ''International Communications'' (2004), p. 49; also see: Josh Getlin and Johanna Neuman, "[http://articles.latimes.com/2003/may/10/news/war-iraqmedia10 Vying for Eyes, Ears of Iraq]"; ''Los Angeles Times'', 10 May 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, [[Al Jazeera]], a TV and internet news network owned by the government of [[Qatar]], has become one of the foremost news sources in the world, appreciated by millions as an alternative to the Western media.&lt;ref&gt;Geniets, ''Global News Challenge'' (2013), p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; State-owned [[China Central Television]] operates 18 channels and reaches more than a billion viewers worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Geniets, ''Global News Challenge'' (2013), p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Iran's [[Press TV]] and Russia's [[Russia Today]], branded as RT, also have multiplatform presences and large audiences.

As distinct from [[advertising]], which deals with marketing distinct from news, [[public relations]] involves the techniques of influencing news in order to give a certain impression to the public. A standard public relations tactic, the "third-party technique", is the creation of seemingly independent organizations, which can deliver objective-sounding statements to news organizations without revealing their corporate connections.&lt;ref&gt;Rampton &amp; Stauber, ''Trust Us, We're Experts'' (2001), pp. 13–20.&lt;/ref&gt; Public relations agencies can create complete content packages, such as [[Video News Release]]s, which are rebroadcast as news without commentary or detail about their origin.&lt;ref&gt;Rampton &amp; Stauber, ''Trust Us, We're Experts'' (2001), pp. 22–24.&lt;/ref&gt; Video news releases seem like normal news programming, but use subtle [[product placement]] and other techniques to influence viewers.&lt;ref&gt;Straubhaar and LaRose, ''Communications Media in the Information Society'' (1997), pp. 395–396.&lt;/ref&gt;

Public relations releases offer valuable newsworthy information to increasingly overworked journalists on deadline.&lt;ref name=Matthews&gt;Jamie Matthews, "Journalists and their sources: The twin challenges of diversity and verification", in Fowler-Watt &amp; Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; (This pre-organized news content has been called an [[information subsidy]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Curtin | first1 = Patricia A. | title = Reevaluating Public Relations Information Subsidies: Market-Driven Journalism and Agenda-Building Theory and Practice | url = | journal = Journal of Public Relations Research | volume = 11 | issue = 1| year = 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The journalist relies on appearances of autonomy and even opposition to established interests—but the public relations agent seek to conceal their client's influence on the news,. Thus, public relations works its magic in secret.&lt;ref name=VanLeuvenJoye /&gt;&lt;ref name=MoloneyJacksonMcQueen /&gt;

Public relations can dovetail with state objectives, as in the case of the [[Nayirah (testimony)|1990 news story]] about Iraqi soldiers taking "babies out of incubators" in Kuwaiti hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;Parenti, ''Inventing Reality'' (1993), p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Nigerian Civil War]], both the federal government and the secessionist Republic of Biafra hired public relations firms, which competed to influence public opinion in the West, and between them established some of the key narratives employed in news reports about the war.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Rothmyer, "What really happened in Biafra? Why did themes such as mass starvation and genocide alternately surface and fade? A study of media susceptibility to public relations manipulation." ''Columbia Journalism Review'' 9.3, Fall 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the position of the public relations industry has grown stronger, while the position of news producers has grown weaker. Public relations agents mediate the production of news about all sectors of society.&lt;ref name=MoloneyJacksonMcQueen&gt;Kevin Moloney, Daniel Jackson, &amp; David McQueen, "News journalism and public relations: a dangerous relationship", in Fowler-Watt &amp; Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

==News consumption==
Over the centuries, commentators on newspapers and society have repeatedly observed widespread human interest in news.&lt;ref name=Stephens13 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Salmon, ''The Newspaper and the Historian'' (1923), pp. 1–2, 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Elite members of a society's political and economic institutions might rely on news as one limited source of information, for the masses, news represents a relatively exclusive window onto the operations by which a society is managed.&lt;ref&gt;Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), pp. 93–94. "Because political events and issues in modern societies typically take place in specialized locations, most citizens experience politics vicariously. […] For elites, information from the media becomes just one of many sources of data. Because of their political involvement and interest and their vast base of prior knowledge, elites treat media coverage as foreground, or sources of new and/or specific information. […] Nonelites, on the other hand, are not so interested in politics, and they have relatively little prior knowledge about political issues. For nonelites, media coverage is not only a source of new data, but their only source of information."&lt;/ref&gt;

Regular people in societies with news media often spend a lot of time reading or watching news reports.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Newspapers became significant aspects of national and literary culture—as exemplified by James Joyce's ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', which derives from the newspapers of June 16 (and thereabouts), 1904, and represents the newspaper office itself as a vital part of life in Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;R. Brandon Kershner, ''The Culture of Joyce's Ulysses''; Palgrave Macmillan, 2010; see Chapter Five, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=yc7HAAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA79 Newspapers and Periodicals: Endless Dialogue]". Also see: James Broderick, "'Give Us This Day Our Daily Press': Journalism in the Life and Art of James Joyce", Dissertation accepted at City University of New York, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1945 study by sociologist [[Bernard Berelson]] found that during the 1945 New York newspaper strike, New Yorkers exhibited a virtual addiction to news, describing themselves as "lost", "nervous", "isolated", and "suffering" due to the withdrawal.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Berelson, "[http://simson.net/ref/1948/What_missing_the_newspaper_means.pdf What 'missing the newspaper' means]", in ''Communications Research 1948–1949'', ed. Lazarsfeld &amp; Stanton; New York: Harper &amp; Brothers, 1949; quoted in Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Television news has become still further embedded in everyday life, with specific programming anticipated at different times of day.&lt;ref name="Allen47"&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 47–48.&lt;/ref&gt; Children tend to find the news boring, too serious, or emotionally disturbing. They come to perceive news as characteristic of adulthood, and begin watching television news in their teenage years because of the adult status it confers.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 113–115.&lt;/ref&gt;

People exhibit various forms of skepticism towards the news. Studies of [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] readers found that many of them gain pleasure from seeing through the obviously fake or poorly constructed stories—and get their "real news" from television.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 110–112.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social and cultural cohesion===
An important feature distinguishing news from private information transfers is the impression that when one reads (or hears, or watches) it, one joins a larger public.&lt;ref name=Starr24&gt;Starr, ''Creation of the Media'' (2004), p. 24. "Publications weave invisible threads of connection among their readers. Once a newspaper circulates, for example, no one ever truly reads it alone. Readers know that others are also seeing it at roughly the same time, and they read it differently as a result, conscious that the information is now out in the open, spread before a public that may talk about the news and act on it."&lt;/ref&gt; In this regard news serves to unify its receivers under the banner of a culture, or a society, as well as into the sub-demographics of a society targeted by their favorite kind of news.&lt;ref&gt;Salmon, ''The Newspaper and the Historian'' (1923), p. 17. "The newspaper has ceased to be a personal organ and has become a social product; it no longer represents the interests of an individual, but it represents rather a group activity. The press groups society and unifies each group, as Scott-James has pointed out. It unifies society on national lines and thus the press of each country has developed in its own characteristic direction. It unifies the groups interested in religion, in politics, in business, in automobiles, in sports, in education, or in fashion, and from these groups having unified interests there has developed the press that ministers to each specialized group."&lt;/ref&gt; News thus plays a role in [[nation-building]], the construction of a national identity.&lt;ref&gt;Motti Neiger, Eyal Zandberg, and Oren Meyers, "Localizing Collective Memory: Radio Broadcasts and the Construction of Regional Memory"; in ''On Media Memory'' (2011), ed. Neiger, Myers, &amp; Zandberg; pp. 156–160. "In Israel, radio played a decisive role in establishing and consolidating the nation during the first decades after the creation of the State (Pansler, 2004). The exclusive position enjoyed by radio in the field of electronic broadcasting during the crucial first twenty years of Israel's existence since 1948, when the press was politically divided and television was absent—Israel's first television channel started broadcasting in 1968—gave it much weight in setting the collective agenda."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Photojournalism|Images connected with news]] can also become iconic and gain a fixed role in the culture. Examples such as [[Alfred Eisenstaedt]]'s photograph ''[[V-J Day in Times Square]]'', [[Nick Ut]]'s photograph of [[Phan Thi Kim Phuc]] and other children running from a napalm blast in Vietnam; [[Kevin Carter]]'s photograph of a starving child being stalked by a vulture;&lt;ref name=Zeiler31 /&gt; etc.

With the new interconnectedness of global media, the experience of receiving news along with a world audience reinforces the social cohesion effect on a larger scale.&lt;ref&gt;McNair, ''Cultural Chaos'' (2006), pp. 6–7. "But [news] is an illusion which, when we receive it, and when we extend to it our trust in its authority as a representation of the real, transports us from the relative isolation of our domestic environments, the parochialism of our streets and small towns, the crowded bustle of our big cities, to membership of virtual global communities, united in access to ''these'' events, communally experienced at ''this'' moment, through global communications networks. […] It is, indeed, more like the fear and exhiliration experienced by watching a movie on the big screen, but with an added viscerality contributed by the awareness that this scene, unlike a movie, is ''really happening'', right now, to real people."&lt;/ref&gt; As a corollary, global media culture may erode the uniqueness and cohesion of national cultures.&lt;ref name=SilverblattZlobin28&gt;Silverblatt &amp; Zlobin, ''International Communications'' (2004), pp. 28–31. "A major liability of transnational media conglomerates is the loss of distinctive local culture. Transnational media conglomerates have a distinctly American influence—regardless of their country of origin. For instance, although Bertlesmann is a German-based corporation, in 2001, its largest proportion of its revenue (35 percent) came from its U.S. media subsidiaries, including Bantam, Doubleday Dell, and Random House publishing companies, ''Family Circle'' and ''McCall's''' magazines, and Arista and RCA record labels."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public sphere===
This collective form experience can be understood to constitute a political realm or [[public sphere]].&lt;ref name=Starr24 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Park, "News as a Form of Knowledge" (1940), p. 677.&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, the news media constitute a [[fourth estate]] which serves to check and balance the operations of government.&lt;ref name="Allen47"/&gt;

This idea, at least as a goal to be sought, has re-emerged in the era of global communications.&lt;ref&gt;Geniets, ''Global News Challenge'' (2013), pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, unprecedented opportunities exist for public analysis and discussion of world events.&lt;ref&gt;McNair, ''Cultural Chaos'' (2006), pp. 140–144.&lt;/ref&gt; According to one interpretation of the [[CNN effect]], instantaneous global news coverage can rally public opinion as never before to motivate political action.&lt;ref&gt;McNair, ''Cultural Chaos'' (2006), pp. 179–185.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, local and global communications media enabled instant exposure to and discussion of the Chinese government's actions in [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square]]. The news about Tiananmen Square traveled over fax machine, telephone, newspaper, radio, and television, and continued to travel even after the government imposed new restrictions on local telecommunications.&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), pp. 70–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

===News events===
As the technological means for disseminating news grew more powerful, news became an experience which millions of people could undergo simultaneously. Outstanding news experiences can exert profound influence on millions of people. Through its power to effect a shared experience, news events can mold the [[collective memory]] of a society.&lt;ref&gt;Salmon, ''The Newspaper and the Historian'' (1923), pp. 211–213.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Park, "News as a Form of Knowledge" (1940), pp. 685–686. "In fact, the multiplication of the means of communication has brought it about that anyone, even in the most distant part of the world, may now actually participate in events—at least as listener if not as spectator—as they actually take place in some other part of the world. We have recently listened to Mussolini address his fascist followers from a balcony of Rome; we have heard Hitler speaking over the heads of a devout congregation in the Reichstag, in Berlin, not merely to the President, but to the people, of the United States. We have even had an opportunity to hear the terms of the momentous Munich agreement ten seconds after it had been signed by the representatives of four of the leading powers in Europe and the world. The fact that acts so momentous as these can be so quickly and so publicly consummated has suddenly and completely changed the character of international politics, so that one can no longer even guess what the future has in store for Europe and for the world."&lt;/ref&gt;

One type of news event, the [[media event]], is a scripted pageant organized for mass live broadcast. Media events include athletic contests such as the Super Bowl and the Olympics, cultural events like awards ceremonies and celebrity funerals, and also political events such as coronations, debates between electoral candidates, and diplomatic ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;Dayan &amp; Katz, ''Media Events'' (1992), pp. 1–14.&lt;/ref&gt; These events typically unfold according to a common format which simplifies the transmission of news items about them.&lt;ref&gt;Dayan &amp; Katz, ''Media Events'' (1992), pp. 25–53.&lt;/ref&gt; Usually they have the effect of increasing the perceived unity of all parties involved, which include the broadcasters and audience.&lt;ref&gt;Dayan &amp; Katz, ''Media Events'' (1992), p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, international events such as a national declaration of independence, can be scripted in advance with the major news agencies, with staff specially deployed to key locations worldwide in advance of the life news broadcast. Public relations companies can participate in these events as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Paterson | first1 = Chris | last2 = Andresen | first2 = Kenneth | last3 = Hoxha | first3 = Abit | title = "The manufacture of an international news event: The day Kosovo was born"; | url = | journal = Journalism | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 103–120 | year= 2011 | doi=10.1177/1464884911400846}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The perception that an ongoing crisis is taking place further increases the significance of live news. People rely on the news and constantly seek more of it, to learn new information and to seek reassurance amidst feelings of fear and uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 57–61.&lt;/ref&gt; Crises can also increase the effect of news on social cohesion, and lead the population of a country to "rally" behind its current leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 73–76.&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of a global news system goes hand in hand with the advent of [[terrorism]] and other sensational acts, which have power in proportion to the audience they capture. In 1979, the [[Iran hostage crisis|capture of American hostages in Iran]] dominated months of news coverage in the western media, gained the status of a "crisis", and influenced a presidential election.&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), pp. 73–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

South Africans overwhelmingly describe the end of Apartheid as a source of the country's most important news.&lt;ref&gt;Danie Du Plessis, "What's News in South Africa?" in Shoemaker &amp; Cohen, ''News Around the World'' (2006), p. 303. "Virtually all references to political significance of news events refer to the historical events of the first part of the 1990s. Current political events are overshadowed so greatly by the start of the political process in South Africa that they have lost much of their significance to the participants. Both black and white participants in the focus group shared this response."&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, news events such as the assassinations of the 1960s (of [[assassination of John F. Kennedy|John F. Kennedy]], [[Assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.|Martin Luther King, Jr.]], and [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|Robert F. Kennedy]]), the 1969 [[moon landing]], the 1986 Challenger explosion, the 1997 death of Princess Diana, the [[Bush v. Gore|intervention of the Supreme Court]] in the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 presidential election]] and the 2001 [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth A. Skewes and Heather Black, "What's News in the United States?" in Shoemaker &amp; Cohen, ''News Around the World'' (2006), p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt; In Jordan, people cited numerous memorable news events involving death and war, including the death of [[King Hussein]], Princess Diana, and [[Assassination of Yitzhak Rabin|Yitzhak Rabin]]. Positive news stories found memorable by Jordanians featured political events affecting their lives and families—such as the [[South Lebanon security belt|Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon]], and the [[Israel–Jordan peace treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;Mohammed Issa Taha Ali, "What's News in Jordan?" in Shoemaker &amp; Cohen, ''News Around the World'' (2006), p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt;

News coverage can also shape collective memory in retrospect. A study of Israeli news coverage leading up to the media event of the nation's 60th birthday found that news coverage of events like the Holocaust, World War Two, and subsequent Israeli wars increased the perceived importance of these events in the minds of citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Neta Kliger-Vilenchik, "Memory-Setting: Applying Agenda-Setting Theory to the Study of Collective Memory"; in ''On Media Memory'' (2011), ed. Neiger, Myers, &amp; Zandberg; pp. 233–234. Also see: Neta Kliger-Vilenchik, "Setting the collective memory agenda: Examining mainstream media influence on individuals' perceptions of the past"; ''Memory Studies'' 7.4, October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===News making===
News making is the act of making the news or doing something that is considered to be newsworthy. When discussing the act of news making, scholars refer to specific models. Five of these models are the Professional Model, Mirror Model, Organizational Model, Political Model, and Civic Journalism Model.&lt;ref name="Graber 1980"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Media and American Politics|last = Graber|first = Doris A.|publisher = Congressional Quarterly Press|year = 1980|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Professional Model is when skilled peoples put certain events together for a specific audience. The reaction of the audience is influential because it can determine the impact that the particular article or newspaper has on the readers.&lt;ref name="post.queensu.ca"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://post.queensu.ca/~rosej/pols313|title = Queen's University – Department of Political Studies|date = |accessdate = |website = Queen's University|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mirror Model states that news should reflect reality. This model aims to focus on particular events and provide accuracy in reporting. The Organizational Model is also known as the Bargaining Model.&lt;ref name="Graber 1980"/&gt; It focuses on influencing various news organizations by applying pressures to governmental processes. The Political Model outlines that news represents the ideological biases of the people as well as the various pressures of the political environment. This model mainly influences journalists and attempts to promote public opinion.&lt;ref name="post.queensu.ca"/&gt; The Civic Journalism Model is when the press discovers the concerns of the people and uses that to write stories. This allows the audience to play an active role in society.

Models of news making help define what the news is and how it influences readers. But it does not necessarily account for the content of print news and online media. Stories are selected if they have a strong impact, incorporate violence and scandal, are familiar and local, and if they are timely.

News Stories with a strong impact can be easily understood by a reader. Violence and scandal create an entertaining and attention-grabbing story.&lt;ref name="Graber 1980"/&gt; Familiarity makes a story more relatable because the reader knows who is being talked about. Proximity can influence a reader more. A story that is timely will receive more coverage because it is a current event. The process of selecting stories coupled with the models of news making are how the media is effective and impactful in society.

===Psychological effects===
{{see also|Media influence|Cultivation theory}}

Exposure to constant news coverage of war can lead to stress and anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' 2001; 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Television coverage of the [[Collapse of the World Trade Center|destruction of the World Trade Center]] in 2001, which repeated the same footage [[psychic driving|over and over]], led to symptoms of [[trauma (medicine)|trauma]] experienced across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Mark A. Schuster, et al., "A National Survey of Stress Reactions After the September 11, 2011, Terrorist Attacks", ''New England Journal of Medicine'', 345.20, 15 November 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have indicated that children have been traumatized by exposure to television of other frightening events, including the Challenger disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Terr | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | title = Children's symptoms in the wake of Challenger: a field study of distant-traumatic effects and an outline of related conditions | url = | journal = American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 156 | issue = 10| year = 1999 | pmid = 10518163 | doi=10.1176/ajp.156.10.1536 | pages=1536–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists themselves also experience trauma and guilt.&lt;ref&gt;Gavin Rees, "The Trauma Factor", in Fowler-Watt &amp; Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Research also suggest that constant representations of violence in the news lead people to overestimate the frequency of its occurrence in the real world, thus increasing their level of fear in everyday situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Altheide | first1 = David L. | title = The News Media, the Problem Frame, and the Production of Fear | url = | journal = Sociological Quarterly | volume = 38 | issue = 4| year= 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence===
The content and style of news delivery certainly have effects on the general public, with the magnitude and precise nature of these effects being tough to determine experimentally.&lt;ref&gt;Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 1–10.&lt;/ref&gt; In Western societies, television viewing has been so ubiquitous that its total effect on psychology and culture leave few alternatives for comparison.&lt;ref&gt;Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 12. "Some media may be so pervasive and so consistent in their effects that their impact is not noticeable. After all, it is almost impossible find someone who doesn't watch television in industrialized societies. And those light viewers associate regularly with others who do watch television. Morgan (1986) suggested that 'the longer we live with television, the smaller television's observable impact may become'.&lt;/ref&gt;

News is the leading source of knowledge about global affairs for people around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Zhong, "Searching for Meaning" (2006), pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[agenda-setting theory]], the general public will identify as its priorities those issues which are highlighted on the news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McCombs | first1 = Maxwell E. | last2 = Shaw | first2 = Donald L. | title = The Agenda-Setting Function of Mass Media | doi = 10.1086/267990 | journal = Public Opinion Quarterly | volume = 36 | issue = 2| page = 176 | year = 1972 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The agenda-setting model has been well-supported by research, which indicate that the public's self-reported concerns respond to changes in news coverage rather than changes in the underlying issue itself.&lt;ref&gt;Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 98–99.&lt;/ref&gt; The less an issue obviously affects people's lives, the bigger an influence media agenda-setting can have on their opinion of it.&lt;ref&gt;Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 100. "When issues are obtrusive, or directly experienced, such as inflation, the public does not need the news media to alert them to its importance. But, the less direct experience that they have with an issue, the more they depend on the news media for awareness. So, agenda-setting appears to be stronger for less personally involving issues."&lt;/ref&gt; The agenda-setting power becomes even stronger in practice because of the correspondence in news topics promulgated by different media channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tien Vu | first1 = Hong | last2 = Guo | first2 = Lei | last3 = McCombs | first3 = Maxwell E. | title = Exploring 'the World Outside and the Pictures in Our Heads': A Network Agenda-Setting Study | url = | journal = Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly | volume = 91 | issue = 4| year= 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Normal Accidents: Living with High-Risk Technologies''''' is a 1984 book by Yale sociologist [[Charles Perrow]], which provides a detailed analysis of complex systems  from a sociological perspective. It was the first to "propose a framework for characterizing complex technological systems such as air traffic, marine traffic, chemical plants, dams, and especially [[nuclear power plant]]s according to their riskiness". Perrow argues that multiple and unexpected failures are built into society's complex and tightly coupled systems. Such accidents are unavoidable and cannot be designed around.&lt;ref name=rev/&gt;

Perrow's argument, based on systemic features and human error, is that big accidents tend to escalate, and technology is not the problem, the organizations are. Each of these principles is still relevant today.&lt;ref name=rev&gt;{{cite web |url=http://esd.mit.edu/WPS/wplit-2003-01.pdf |title=Normal Accidents by Charles Perrow |author=Daniel E Whitney  |year=2003 |work=Massachusetts Institute of Technology }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Meltdown: Why Our Systems Fail and What We Can Do About It|last=Clearfield|first=Chris|last2=Tilcsik|first2=András|publisher=Penguin Press|year=2018|isbn=9780735222632|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==System accidents==
{{details|System accident}}
"Normal" accidents, or system accidents, are so-called by Perrow because such accidents are inevitable in extremely complex systems. Given the characteristic of the system involved, multiple failures which interact with each other will occur, despite efforts to avoid them. Perrow said that [[operator error]] is a very common problem, many failures relate to organizations rather than technology, and big accidents almost always have very small beginnings.&lt;ref&gt;Perrow, Charles. ''Normal Accidents: Living with High-Risk Technologies'' New York: Basic Books, 1984. p.5&lt;/ref&gt;  Such events appear trivial to begin with before unpredictably cascading through the system to create a large event with severe consequences.&lt;ref name=rev/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Normal Accidents'' contributed key concepts to a set of intellectual developments in the 1980s that revolutionized the conception of safety and risk. It made the case for examining technological failures as the product of highly interacting systems, and highlighted organizational and management factors as the main causes of failures. Technological disasters could no longer be ascribed to isolated equipment malfunction, operator error or acts of God.&lt;ref name=nature477/&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Perrow identifies three conditions that make a system likely to be susceptible to Normal Accidents. These are:
* The system is '''complex'''
* The system is '''tightly coupled'''
* The system has '''catastrophic potential'''

==Three Mile Island==
The inspiration for Perrow's books was the 1979 [[Three Mile Island accident]], where a [[nuclear accident]] resulted from an unanticipated interaction of multiple failures in a complex system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The event was an example of a normal accident because it was "unexpected, incomprehensible, uncontrollable and unavoidable".&lt;ref&gt;Perrow, C. (1982), "The President’s Commission and the Normal Accident", in Sils, D., Wolf, C. and Shelanski, V. (Eds), ''Accident at Three Mile Island: The Human Dimensions'', Westview, Boulder, pp.173–184.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Perrow concluded that the failure at Three Mile Island was a consequence of the system's immense complexity. Such modern high-risk systems, he realized, were prone to failures however well they were managed. It was inevitable that they would eventually suffer what he termed a 'normal accident'. Therefore, he suggested, we might do better to contemplate a radical redesign, or if that was not possible, to abandon such technology entirely.&lt;ref name=nature477&gt;{{cite web |title=In retrospect:Normal accidents |author=Nick Pidgeon |date=22 September 2011 Vol 477 |work=Nature }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==New reactor designs==
One disadvantage of any new nuclear reactor technology is that safety risks may be greater initially as reactor operators have little experience with the new design.  Nuclear engineer [[David Lochbaum]] has explained that almost all serious nuclear accidents have occurred with what was at the time the most recent technology. He argues that "the problem with new reactors and accidents is twofold: scenarios arise that are impossible to plan for in simulations; and humans make mistakes".&lt;ref name=safe/&gt; As one director of a U.S. research laboratory put it, "fabrication, construction, operation, and maintenance of new reactors will face a steep learning curve: advanced technologies will have a heightened risk of accidents and mistakes. The technology may be proven, but people are not".&lt;ref name=safe&gt;Benjamin K. Sovacool. ''A Critical Evaluation of Nuclear Power and Renewable Electricity in Asia, ''Journal of Contemporary Asia'', Vol. 40, No. 3, August 2010, p. 381.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, [[Redundancy (engineering)|engineering redundancies]] which are put in place to help ensure safety, may backfire and produce less, not more reliability. This may happen in three ways: First, redundant safety devices result in a more complex system, more prone to errors and accidents. Second, redundancy may lead to shirking of responsibility among workers. Third, redundancy may lead to increased production pressures, resulting in a system that operates at higher speeds, but less safely.&lt;ref name=perr2004&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iis-db.stanford.edu/pubs/20276/sagan_oe_dec03.pdf |title=Learning from Normal Accidents |author=Scott D.

The '''Oera Linda Book''' is a manuscript written in a form of [[Old Frisian]], purporting to cover historical, mythological, and religious themes of remote antiquity, from 2194 BCE to 803 CE. Among academics in [[Germanic philology]], the document is widely considered to be a [[hoax]] or [[forgery]].

The manuscript first came to public awareness in the 1860s. In 1872, Jan Gerhardus Ottema published a Dutch translation and defended it as genuine. Over the next few years there was a heated public controversy, but by 1879 it was universally accepted that the text was a recent composition. Nevertheless, a public controversy was revived in the context of 1930s [[Nazi occultism]], and the book is still occasionally brought up in esotericism and [[Atlantis]] literature. The manuscript's author is not known with certainty, hence it is unknown whether the intention was to produce a [[hoax]], a [[parody]] or simply an exercise in poetic fantasy.

Historian Goffe Jensma published a monograph on the manuscript in 2004, ''De gemaskerde god'' ("The Masked God"), including a new translation and a discussion of the history of its reception. Jensma concludes that it was probably intended as a "hoax to fool some nationalist [[Frisia|Frisians]] and orthodox Christians", as well as an "experiential exemplary exercise" by Dutch theologian and poet [[Piet Paaltjens|François Haverschmidt]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://historischhuis.nl/recensiebank/review/show/414] {{ISBN|90-6550-841-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Zeker ook nieuw aan mijn boek is wat ik op grond van het handschrift zelf kon concluderen over de tijd van ontstaan en over de wijze waarop het is gemaakt, namelijk in een aantal fases en niet door één auteur, maar zeker door twee en vermoedelijk door drie auteurs.'' [http://www.semafoor.net/Jensmareactie.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of reception==

===19th century===
The Oera Linda Book, known in [[Old Frisian]] as ''Thet Oera Linda Bok'', came to light in 1867 when Cornelis Over de Linden (1811&amp;ndash;1874) handed the manuscript, which he claimed to have inherited from his grandfather, via his aunt, over to Eelco Verwijs (1830&amp;ndash;1880), the provincial librarian of Friesland, for translation and publication. Verwijs rejected the manuscript, but in 1872 Jan Gerhardus Ottema (1804&amp;ndash;1879), a prominent member of the Frisian Society for History and Culture, published a Dutch translation. Ottema believed it to be written in authentic [[Old Frisian]]. The book was subsequently translated into English by William Sandbach in 1876, and published by Trübner &amp; Co. of London.

Within the first few years after the appearance of the Oera Linda Book, its recent origin was established not only based on the exceptional claims being made, but also because of a number of anachronisms it contained. The text was nevertheless a source of inspiration for a number of occultists and speculative historians. While there was some debate among Dutch academics and in a number of newspapers about the book's authenticity during the 1870s, by 1879 it was widely recognized as a forgery.

===Nazi Germany===
More than forty years later, beginning in 1922, Dutch ''[[völkisch]]'' philologist [[Herman Wirth]] revived the issue. Wirth published a German translation of what he dubbed the "Nordic Bible" in 1933, as ''Die Ura Linda Chronik''.

A panel discussion on Wirth's book at the University of Berlin on 4 May 1934 was the immediate impulse for the foundation of the [[Ahnenerbe]] Nazi "[[think tank]]" by [[Heinrich Himmler|Himmler]] and Wirth, together with [[Richard Walther Darré]]. Because of the infatuation of Himmler with the Oera Linda Book and its consequent association with Nazi occultism, it became known as "Himmler's Bible". Wirth's book was by no means universally acclaimed among the Nazi-era Nordicist academics, and the 1934 panel discussion was steeped in heated controversy. [[Alfred Rosenberg]] and his circle rejected it. [[Gustav Neckel]] had praised Wirth's work before publication, but upon seeing its content published a dismayed recension.&lt;ref&gt;''Der Tag'', Berlin,  31. December 1933.&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking in defense of the book's authenticity were [[Walther Wüst]] and [[Otto Huth]], besides Wirth himself. Speaking against its authenticity were Neckel, Karl Hermann Jacob-Friesen (who identified it as a satirical hoax by Linden) and [[Arthur Hübner]]. Hübner was one of the most respected Germanists of his generation, and his verdict of the Oera Linda being a falsification settled the defeat of Wirth's party. The public defeat of Himmler's scholarly brand of "esoteric Nordicism" resulted in the foundation of Ahnenerbe, which attracted occultists such as [[Karl Maria Wiligut]] and was viewed with suspicion by the mainstream National Socialist ideologues of [[Amt Rosenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;Gerd Simon, [http://homepages.uni-tuebingen.de/gerd.simon/himmlerbibel.pdf Himmlers Bibel und die öffentlichkeitswirksamste Podiumsdiskussion in der Geschichte der Germanistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern esotericism===
The book experienced a revival of popularity in the English-speaking world with the writings of Robert Scrutton. In ''The Other Atlantis'' (1977) he reproduced the full text of Sandbach's 1876 English translation, interspersed with his own commentaries on history and mythology.&lt;ref&gt;Scrutton, Robert. ''The Other Atlantis'' (1977) {{ISBN|0-72217-665-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Secrets of Lost Atland'' (1979) he became the first to link the book with the concept of [[earth mysteries]], and, in particular, [[ley lines]] and [[telluric current|telluric energy]].&lt;ref&gt;Scrutton, Robert. ''Secrets of Lost Atland'' (1979) {{ISBN|0-72217-667-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Scrutton's example, English language accounts of the Oera Linda Book tend to place it within the [[New Age]] or [[alternate history]] genres, and do not associate it with National Socialism, as is the case in Germany.

Another figure to formulate a contemporary [[Modern Paganism|Neopagan]] tradition influenced by the Oera Linda Book was Tony Steele, who considered the book to reveal the genuine truth about the ancient European [[megalith|megalithic culture]]. In ''Water Witches'' (1998) he examined the book's use as a cultural identity marker by the Frisian-descended canal folk of the [[The Midlands|English Midlands]].&lt;ref&gt;Steele, Tony. ''Water Witches'' (1998) {{ISBN|1-86163-049-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Rites and Rituals of Traditional Witchcraft'' (2001) he connected the religious practices of the priestesses described in the book with later medieval [[witchcraft]] traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Steele, Tony. ''The Rites and Rituals of Traditional Witchcraft'' (2001) {{ISBN|1-86163-140-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authorship==
Among those who doubt the book's authenticity, the most popular candidates for the author of the manuscript are Cornelis Over de Linden or Eelco Verwijs. A recent third choice is the Protestant preacher François Haverschmidt (1835&amp;ndash;1894), well known for writing poetry under the pseudonym Piet Paaltjens. Haverschmidt lived in Friesland and was an acquaintance of Verwijs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://skepsis.nl/oeralinda/ Skepsis.nl]&lt;/ref&gt;

Goffe Jensma (2004) argued that Haverschmidt was the main writer of the book, with the help of Over de Linden and Verwijs. According to Jensma, Haverschmidt intended the Oera Linda Book as a parody of the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Bible]]. An article in late 2007 by Jensma&lt;ref&gt;Extraordinary professor of Frisian Language and Culture, in particular the literary-historical aspects of Frisian, at the Faculty of Humanities of the [[Universiteit van Amsterdam]]&lt;/ref&gt; says that the three authors of the translation intended it "to be a temporary hoax to fool some nationalist Frisians and orthodox Christians and as an experiential exemplary exercise in reading the Holy Bible in a non-fundamentalist, symbolical way."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rug.nl/news/2004/11/122_00?lang=en ''Oera Linda-boek was poging van Haverschmidt om bijbel te ontkrachten''] [[Rijks Universiteit Groningen]], 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Ignoring clues that it was a forgery, J. G. Ottema took it seriously, and it achieved popularity for the reasons given above. Its creators felt unable to admit that they had written it, and it became the foundation for new occult beliefs. Jensma concludes his article by saying "It is a perfect irony that a book written to unmask the Holy Bible as a book of human making was to become a bible itself."&lt;ref name="Jensma"&gt;{{Citation|title=How to Deal with Holy Books in an Age of Emerging Science.

==Contents==
Themes running through the Oera Linda Book include [[catastrophism]], [[nationalism]], [[matriarchy]], and [[mythology]]. The text alleges that Europe and other lands were, for a large part of their history, ruled by a succession of folk-mothers presiding over a hierarchical order of celibate priestesses dedicated to the goddess [[Frijjo|Frya]], daughter of the creator god Wr-alda and Jrtha, the earth mother. The claim is also made that this Frisian civilization possessed an alphabet that was the ancestor of the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] and [[Phoenician alphabet]]s. Modern [[historiography]] is essentially ignored, particularly in the area of basic chronology of known events in the recent and distant past of Europe. Geological as well as geographical evidence that was readily available even as far back as Over de Linden's time is also mostly absent from the manuscript.

The earliest portion of the Oera Linda Book, namely ''Frya’s Tex'', was supposedly composed in 2194 BC, whereas the most recent part, the letter of Hidde Oera Linda, dates to AD 1256. Almost half of the entire book comprises ''The Book of Adela’s Followers'', the original text around which the rest grew. It is purported to have been compiled in the 6th century BC from a mixture of contemporary writings and ancient inscriptions. The last two sections of the Oera Linda Book contain a number of [[lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunae]] and the book itself breaks off in mid-sentence.

It also describes a lost land called [[Atlantis|Atland]] (the name given to Atlantis by the 17th century scholar [[Olof Rudbeck]]), which was supposedly submerged in 2194 BC, the same year as 19th century Dutch and Frisian almanacs, following traditional Biblical chronology given for [[Deluge (mythology)|Noah's flood]].&lt;ref name="Jensma"/&gt;

===Sections===

The Oera Linda Book is divided into six sections, further subdivided into a total of 53 chapters.

* Letters
* The Book of Adela's Followers 
* The Writings of Adelbrost and Apollonia 
* The Writings of Frêthorik and Wiljow
* The Writing of Konerêd
* Fragments

[[File:RidersOfJudgment.jpg|thumb|First edition (publ. [[Random House]])]]
'''''Riders of Judgment''''' is the fifth book chronologically in [[Frederick Manfred]]'s ''[[The Buckskin Man Tales]]'', which trace themes through five novels set in the 19th Century Great Plains. The story fictionalizes [[Wyoming]]'s [[Johnson County War]], based on Manfred's original research (which relied heavily on Johnson County Historian Thelma Condit). His analysis of events is close to the story as recounted in Helena Huntington Smith's ''The War on Powder River'',&lt;ref name="HHS01" /&gt; which was published about ten years after Manfred's novel.

The novel was the source for the made-for-television film ''The Johnson County War,'' starring Tom Berenger. Manfred's novelization uses Nate Champion, Jack Flagg, and John Tisdale as the models for his Hammett brothers, Cain, Harry, and Dale, and turns Frank Canton into a strange family nemesis called variously Hunt Lawton and Link Keeler. Manfred changes the names of the county and the nearby towns.

{{Distinguish|The Sound of Music Live!}}
'''''The Sound of Music Live''''' is a [[television special]] that was originally broadcast by [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] on 20 December 2015. The special was an adaptation of [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s Broadway musical ''[[The Sound of Music]]'', starring [[Kara Tointon]] as [[Maria von Trapp]], performed and televised [[live television|live]] from [[3 Mills Studios]] in London. 

On 9 November 2018, the production was broadcast in the United States as part of [[PBS]]'s performing arts anthology series ''[[Great Performances]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.unionleader.com/great-performances-imports-uk-s-sound-of-music/article_f1a6feb2-4b7f-57f9-9a41-e05aa84a76de.html|title='Great Performances' imports UK's 'Sound of Music'|work=UnionLeader.com|access-date=2018-11-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, ITV announced that it would transmit a live adaptation of the musical ''[[The Sound of Music]]'' as part of its holiday programming lineup, in what would be the first time that such a programme had been attempted in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="deadline-itvsom"&gt;{{cite web|title=ITV To Mount ‘The Sound Of Music Live!’ UK Christmas Special|url=http://deadline.com/2015/10/itv-sound-of-music-live-christmas-special-kara-tointon-1201590814/|website=Deadline.com|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Sound of Music Live'' was part of ITV's continuing efforts to broadcast more live "[[Event television|event]]" programs, which are designed to attract critical masses of viewers by encouraging them to watch via the original broadcast, rather than via [[video on demand|catch-up]] services and [[digital video recorder]]s. The desire for increased ITV viewership came especially in the wake of declining ratings for its reality music competition ''[[The X Factor (UK)|The X Factor]]'', whose [[The X Factor (UK series 12)|series 12]] finale had the second-smallest viewership in the programme's history. ITV had similarly broadcast live episodes of its series ''[[Coronation Street]]'' in [[Coronation Street Live (2000 episode)|2000]] and [[Coronation Street Live (2010 episode)|2010]] in honour of its 40th and 50th anniversary respectively, and in 2015 for ITV's 60th anniversary.&lt;ref name="deadline-itvsom"/&gt;

This was not the first time that ''The Sound of Music'' had been adapted in such a manner. In 2013, U.S. network [[NBC]] broadcast its own [[The Sound of Music Live!|live television adaptation of ''The Sound of Music'']] starring [[country music|country]] singer [[Carrie Underwood]]; similarly to ITV's version, it was an adaptation of the original musical, and not based on the [[The Sound of Music|film version]]. Although it received mixed reviews, it was seen by over 18 million viewers. As follow-ups, NBC produced similar adaptations of ''[[Peter Pan Live!|Peter Pan]]'' and ''[[The Wiz Live!|The Wiz]]'' in 2014 and 2015 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/tv/the-wiz-live-nbc-s-latest-live-musical-broadcast-from-long-island-1.11164689|title=‘The Wiz Live!’: NBC’s latest live musical broadcast from Long Island|last1=Crook|first1=John|date=26 November 2015|website=newsday.com |publisher=Newsday|access-date=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://tvline.com/2013/12/06/sound-of-music-live-ratings-nbc/ |title=Ratings: NBC's Sound of Music Live!

==Cast==
[[Kara Tointon]] played Maria, and [[Julian Ovenden]] played Captain Georg von Trapp. The supporting cast included veterans of British television and theatre, including [[Alexander Armstrong]] as Max Detweiler, [[Katherine Kelly (actress)|Katherine Kelly]] as Baroness Elsa Schraeder, [[Maria Friedman]] as Mother Abess, [[Evelyn Hoskins]] as Liesl von Trapp, Jon Tarcy as Rolf Gruber, [[Mel Giedroyc]] as the housekeeper, Frau Schmidt, and [[Paul Copley]] as the butler, Franz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sound of Music Live!|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/episode/dwnsbw/the-sound-of-music-live|website=Radio Times|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''The Sound of Music Live'' received mixed reviews. Mark Shenton of ''[[The Stage]]'' said it was a failed experiment, with "uninspired and sometimes insipid" choreography and direction, although he praised the cast's performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shenton|first1=Mark|title=The Sound of Music Live review – ‘bold experiment doesn’t pay off’|url=https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2015/the-sound-of-music-live-review-bold-experiment-doesnt-pay-off/|website=The Stage|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claire Allfree of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' said it lacked both the intimacy of live theatre and the scope of the big screen, but nevertheless judged it "more a success than it was a failure," saying that former ''[[EastEnders]]'' star Tointon "brought a refreshing earthiness and grit to Maria that made the passionate, unconventional novice feel thoroughly modern and accessible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sound of Music Live, review: 'much to enjoy'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/tv-and-radio-reviews/12056862/the-sound-of-music-review-kara-tointon-live-itv.html|website=The Telegraph|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]]'' said that Tointon was "showered with praise" for her performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kara Tointon shocks fans with incredible vocals as she plays Maria in The Sound Of Music live|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/kara-tointon-shocks-fans-incredible-7048037|website=The Mirror|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The programme was watched by over 3.82 million viewers according to overnight ratings figures, being beaten by the [[The Apprentice (UK series eleven)|series eleven]] finale of ''[[The Apprentice (UK TV series)|The Apprentice]]'' (5.31 million) and its lead-in, the [[2015 BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award|BBC Sports Personality of the Year]] presentation (5.78 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/the-apprentice/news/a777848/uk-tv-ratings-the-apprentice-final-loses-800000-from-last-year-sports-personality-is-top-with-57m/ |title=UK TV ratings: The Apprentice final is lowest in 10 years, Sports Personality is top with 5.7m |author=Tom Eames |work=Digital Spy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ITV's The Sound of Music Live draws 4m viewers|url=https://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2015/itvs-the-sound-of-music-live-draws-4m-viewers/|website=The Stage|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third [[Eurovision Dance Contest]] was originally planned to be organised in [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]] at the [[Heydar Aliyev Sports and Exhibition Complex]] on 26 September 2009.&lt;ref name="date"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esckaz.com/edc/|title=European Broadcasting Union has finally officially confirmed the date of EDC 2009|date=2009-04-02|publisher=''ESCKaz''|accessdate=2009-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[İctimai Televiziya və Radio Yayımları Şirkəti|İctimai Television]] was planning to increase the number of participating countries as well as inviting a world-famous star to host the contest, listing [[Jennifer Lopez]], [[Kylie Minogue]] and [[Shakira]] as candidates.&lt;ref name="hosts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.apa.az/news.php?id=102659|title=We are negotiating with Jennifer Lopez, Kylie Minogue and Shakira to host the Eurovision Dance 2009 in Azerbaijan}}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional extravaganza [[open-air concert]] was planned to be held, bringing together ex-participants of the [[Eurovision Song Contest|Eurovision]], [[Junior Eurovision Song Contest|Junior Eurovision]] and [[Eurovision Dance Contest|Eurovision Dance]] Contests on one stage.&lt;ref name="date" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovisiondance.tv/page/news?id=1905|title=Baku: More details announced at press conference}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participants==
On the date of cancellation, two countries had finished selection of the participating couples for the contest:

*{{esc|Azerbaijan|Dance}} – host country
*{{esc|Belarus|Dance}} – winners of 3-month long preselection show ''Star Dances'' were [[Yulia Raskina]] and [[Denis Moryasin]]. Producer of the show confirmed that they would take part in Eurovision Dance Contest 2010 if it is organised.&lt;ref name="date"/&gt;
*{{esc|Poland|Dance}} – [[Natasza Urbańska]] and Jan Kliment.
*{{esc|Portugal|Dance}} – internal selection was expected to take place with the couple being selected from the RTP series ''Dança Comigo''.&lt;ref name="Portugal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eurofire.blog.de/2009/04/15/news-splitter-5950321/|title=News Splitter (208)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{esc|Russia|Dance}} – was set to be represented by professional couple [[Sergey Konovaltsev]] and [[Olga Konovaltseva]], named as participants of the show as early as in May 2008 and confirmed in 2009 edition of Russian version of ''[[Dancing with the Stars]]''.&lt;ref name="date"/&gt;

==Cancellation==
However, on 28 May 2009, [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU) had announced that the contest was postponed at least until Autumn 2010 as "the number of broadcasters that signed up for participation had not reach the desired level". According to a preliminary calculations, at least five countries that were taking part in [[Eurovision Dance Contest 2008]], namely {{esccnty|Austria|Dance}}, {{esccnty|Finland|Dance}}, {{esccnty|Lithuania|Dance}}, {{esccnty|Netherlands|Dance}} and {{esccnty|Sweden|Dance}} had announced withdrawal from the contest, with only {{esccnty|Belarus|Dance}} confirming its participation as a début country.&lt;ref name="date"/&gt;

According to contest coordinator on behalf of EBU Tal Barnea "concrete plans for a 2010 autumn event were being developed, with considerable changes to introduce a new programme proposal". These plans were expected to be unveiled in the autumn of 2009. EBU also praised "the commendable work on the next Eurovision Dance Contest already completed by our partners Ictimai Television and the Azerbaijani officials" stating that 2010 edition of the contest was planned to take place in [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]] as well. 

In January 2010, EBU Eurovision coordinator, [[Svante Stockselius]], announced that contest has been postponed again, and is now unlikely to happen at all, at least within the next couple of years. He explained this decision was the fact that the popularity of televised dance shows had calmed down recently.&lt;ref name="date1"/&gt;

'''This Is It''' was a planned [[concert residency]] by [[Michael Jackson]] which was scheduled to begin in July 2009 and end September 29, 2009 with a second leg which was scheduled to run from January 2010 through March 2010 with a total of 50 shows.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/michael-jacksons-this-is-it-tour-balloons-to-50-show-run-stretching-into-2010-20090312&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson announced This Is It at a press conference in the [[The O2 Arena|O2 Arena]], stating that it would be his final series of concerts in London. [[AEG Live]], the concert promoters, released a promotional video that took up an entire commercial break, setting a record for [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]. Initially, only 10 concerts were announced, but following public demand, 40 more concerts were added. Ticket sales broke several records and Jackson's album sales increased following the announcement; AEG Live estimated that the first 10&amp;nbsp;dates alone would have earned Jackson approximately £50 million. 

In preparation for the concert series, Jackson had been collaborating with high-profile figures including fashion designer [[Christian Audigier]], choreographer [[Kenny Ortega]] and bodybuilder [[Lou Ferrigno]]. Prior to Jackson's death in 2009, Allgood Entertainment sued Jackson for $40 million, claiming that he had breached an exclusivity agreement with them by agreeing to the This Is It concerts; the case was dismissed.

After Jackson's death, AEG Live offered either refunds to ticket holders or a special "souvenir" ticket designed by Jackson.

Jackson announced the first 10 performances during a press conference at the O2 Arena on March 5, 2009.

On May 20, it was announced that the first concert would be pushed back five days to July 13 and three other July dates would be rescheduled for March 2010. AEG Live said that the delay was necessary because more time was needed for dress rehearsals. The revised schedule called for 27 shows between July 13 and September 29, 2009, followed by a three-month break, before resuming in the new year with 23 more shows between January 7 and March 6, 2010.&lt;ref name = "new dates"/&gt; Some fans petitioned for the reversal of AEG Live's decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nme.com/news/michael-jackson/44820 |title=Michael Jackson fans launch petition over O2 Arena postponement |publisher=''NME'' |date=May 21, 2009 |accessdate=June 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In late June, several hundred seats for each of the dates were put on sale.

It was suggested that after the London concerts, Jackson might head to [[Australia]], [[Europe]], [[India]], [[China]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Japan]] before moving on to North America. Randy Phillips, the CEO of [[AEG Live]], told The LA Times that Australia was part of Michael Jackson's international tour plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.take40.com/news/16590/michael-jackson-planning-australian-tour-before-his-death |title=Michael Jackson Planning Australian Tour Before His Death |publisher=Take 40 |date=June 28, 2009 |accessdate=May 6, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504000236/http://www.take40.com/news/16590/michael-jackson-planning-australian-tour-before-his-death |archivedate=May 4, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jermaine Jackson's 2011 book ''You Are Not Alone: Michael Through a Brother's Eyes'', after the London concerts were finished, Jackson was planning to extend his deal with AEG Live which included new music, a potential three-picture movie deal, a series of one-off concert dates starting in China, a halftime slot at one of the future [[Super Bowl]] games to surpass his own halftime show at the [[Super Bowl XXVII]] in January 1993 and two more tours (one of which was to be a final reunion with his brothers based on a promise made to their [[Katherine Jackson|mother]] to see her sons perform together one last time before she passed away). After the deal was completed, he planned to take time off from musical entertainment and move on to (possibly) directing his own film ideas, such as making a feature-length motion picture based on his 1982 song "Thriller" and [[Michael Jackson's Thriller (music video)|the music video of the same name]]. It was also later revealed that [http://www.damienshields.com/michael-jacksons-halloween-special-that-never-was/ a yearly Halloween television special] based on his horror-themed songs, such as "Thriller" and "Ghosts", was part of Jackson's deal with AEG Live.

In [[Trial of Conrad Murray|Conrad Murray's manslaughter trial]], David Walgren stated another one of Jackson's future plans was to open a children's hospital. This was heard in an audio tape Conrad Murray played of Jackson under the influence of propofol on May 10, 2009. His voice is barely recognisable in the recording, but he can be clearly heard saying that he wanted to build the greatest children's hospital in the world and name it after himself: The ''Michael Jackson's Children's Hospital''. Walgren also stated that while the tour was happening, Jackson wanted to buy an estate with streams, horses and animals so his three children, Prince, Paris and Blanket could live normal lives as their father performed the concerts, as he was photographed looking for a house in the United Kingdom with his children. Walgren also said that the tour would begin that summer, and Jackson could take his children out of school and bring them with him so they could see him perform in London.

===Songs prepared===
As shown in ''[[Michael Jackson's This Is It]]'', songs prepared for the concerts included "[[Wanna Be Startin' Somethin']]", "[[Jam (song)|Jam]]", "[[They Don't Care About Us]]", "[[Human Nature (Michael Jackson song)|Human Nature]]", "[[Smooth Criminal]]", "[[The Way You Make Me Feel]]", a medley of songs by [[The Jackson 5]] consisting of "[[I Want You Back]]", "[[The Love You Save]]", "[[I'll Be There (The Jackson 5 song)|I'll Be There]]" and "[[Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)]]", "[[I Just Can't Stop Loving You]]", "[[Thriller (song)|Thriller]]", "[[Beat It]]", "[[Black or White]]", "[[Earth Song]]", "[[Billie Jean]]", and "[[Man in the Mirror]]". Later on, "[[Stranger in Moscow]]", "[[You Are Not Alone]]", "[[Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough]]", "[[Rock with You (Michael Jackson song)|Rock with You]]", "[[Dirty Diana]]" ,"[[You Rock My World]]", "[[Dangerous (Michael Jackson song)|Dangerous]]", "[[We Are the World]]", "[[Heal the World]]" and "[[Will You Be There]]" were also confirmed to have been planned for the shows. Due to the larger than usual roster of songs, as well as time constraints, Jackson would perform some songs with one verse less than he did in previous tours (such as "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'", "Jam", "The Way You Make Me Feel" and "Black or White"). "[[Bad (Michael Jackson song)|Bad]]" was rumored to have been reserved for select concerts. On the final dates, Jackson wanted to perform a ballad called "River Ripple", written by him, with an African choir and his children. During the final concert before "Man in the Mirror", Michael was slated to premiere a song called "Best of Joy", written and recorded in 2009 prior to Jackson's death. As of 2018, the full version of "River Ripple" remains unreleased (although snippets of the song have leaked on YouTube), while "Best of Joy" was officially released in 2010 on Jackson's first posthumous album of unreleased songs, ''[[Michael (album)|Michael]]''.

==Litigation==
In June 2009, concert promoter Allgood Entertainment, represented by Ira Meyerowitz and Jon Kekielek of MJlawfirm, sued Jackson for $40 million. He claimed that Jackson, through his manager [[Frank DiLeo]], had agreed to a single and a $30 million reunion concert with [[The Jackson 5]] and his sister [[Janet Jackson]]. According to the concert promoter, the alleged contractual agreement prevented Jackson from performing elsewhere before the reunion concert and for a three-month period after it. Thus, agreeing to a 50 date residency at the O2 arena was an alleged breach of the Allgood Entertainment contract. The filing company stated that AEG Live knew of the alleged agreement with Jackson and used their dominance in the industry to coerce Jackson into agreeing to the residency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8094537.stm |title=Jackson sued over reunion concert |publisher=BBC |date=June 11, 2009 |accessdate=June 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sean |last=Michaels |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jun/12/michael-jackson-sued-o2-arena|title=Michael Jackson sued for O2 arena residency|publisher=''The Guardian'' |date=June 12, 2009 |accessdate=June 12, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sean |last=Michaels |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/may/12/michael-jackson-comeback-concerts |title=Michael Jackson comeback concerts in jeopardy? |publisher=''The Guardian'' |date=June 12, 2009 |accessdate=June 12, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2010, the judge dismissed the case, stating that there was no evidence of a binding agreement, no contracts were signed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11038050 | work=BBC News | title=Judge dismisses Jackson reunion claim | date=August 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was in limbo as of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.recapthelaw.org/nysd/347380/ |title=AllGood Entertainment, Inc. et al v.

==Jackson's death and refunds==
{{Further|Death of Michael Jackson}}

On June 25, 2009, Jackson died after going into [[cardiac arrest]] which was caused by an overdose of [[Propofol]] and [[Benzodiazepine|benzodiazepines]], eighteen days before his planned first show. AEG Live, who persuaded Jackson to sign up for the shows, faced a liability of up to £300 million and an empty venue for the next nine months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sherwin|first=Adam|title=O2 arena counts cost as curtain closes on the greatest show of all|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article6580748.ece|publisher=The Times|date=June 26, 2009|accessdate=June 26, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The O2 arena stated that full refunds, including all ticket service charges, would be available to those who purchased tickets through authorized agents, but that "fans will have the option to be sent the actual tickets they would have received to attend the shows in lieu of the full refunds which are being offered."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UCLA Statement&amp;nbsp;— Michael Jackson|url=http://www.theo2.co.uk/inside/ucla-statement-michael-jackson.html |publisher=[[The O2 Arena]] |accessdate=July 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fans who bought their tickets from private sellers potentially faced difficulties. eBay recommended that purchasers contact their sellers for refunds and stated that those who used PayPal can get their money back if the purchase was made during the last 45 days,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8120412.stm |title=Refund issues over Jackson gigs |publisher=''BBC News'' |date=June 26, 2009 |accessdate=June 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; then later stated that "all buyers on the site will receive a full refund for their ticket purchase".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8122580.stm |title=eBay will refund Jackson tickets |publisher=BBC News |date=June 27, 2009 |accessdate=June 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Posthumous film and album==
{{Further|Michael Jackson's This Is It|Michael Jackson's This Is It (album)}}

Following Jackson's death, AEG stated that they had over "100 hours of footage of preparations and rehearsals for the shows".&lt;ref name="filmdeal2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32360110 |title=Judge OKs Jackson performance film deal |agency=Associated Press |work=[[MSNBC|MSNBC.com]] |date=August 10, 2009 |accessdate=October 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 10, 2009, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff approved a deal between film distributor [[Columbia Pictures]] and AEG Live for the former company to purchase and distribute rehearsal footage of Jackson for a film entitled ''[[Michael Jackson's This Is It]]''.&lt;ref name="filmdeal2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="deal6"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/showbiz/2009-08/06/content_8532737.htm |title=Michael Jackson film deal outlined in court papers |work=ChinaDaily.com |date=August 6, 2009 |accessdate=October 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deal3"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-ct-jackson11-2009aug11,0,2938755.story |author=Christopher Smith |work=[[LA Times|LA Times.com]] |title=Sony Pictures to produce Michael Jackson film |accessdate=September 21, 2009 | date=August 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to court documents, Columbia paid $60 million (£35 million) for rights to the rehearsal footage.&lt;ref name="deal6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="filmdeal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/news/michael_jackson/news/13441 |title=Michael jackson This Is It film deal agreed |work=Uncut.co.uk |date=August 8, 2009|accessdate=October 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The papers filed in court had reportedly stated that Jackson's estate will get 90% of the profits and that AEG Live will get the remaining 10% from the film's revenue.&lt;ref name="filmdeal2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="deal4"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/aug/11/michael-jackson-film-october-release |author=Rosie Swash |title=Michael Jackson film gets October release date |work=[[Guardian.co.uk]] |date=August 11, 2009 |accessdate=October 2, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was directed by [[Kenny Ortega]] who was also the director of the live concert. It was compiled mostly from footage that was shot as reference for production discussions and was never meant to be shown publicly.  Some of the music and vocals in the film were added from previous recordings, though most were from the live performance. The film was released on October 28, 2009.&lt;ref name="This Is It Worldwide Release Dates"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/michaeljacksonthisisit/international/ |title=This Is It Worldwide Release Dates |work=[[Sony Pictures|Sony Pictures.com]] |accessdate=September 21, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922214515/http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/michaeljacksonthisisit/international/ |archivedate=September 22, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''For the geographical place see [[Tonto Basin]]

'''''Tonto Basin''''' is a western novel written by [[Zane Grey]].

==Origin==
''Tonto Basin'' is the original version of the shorter novel ''[[To the Last Man (Zane Grey)|To The Last Man]]'' (1921). Grey submitted the manuscript of ''Tonto Basin'' to the magazine ''The Country Gentleman,'' which published it in serialization as ''To the Last Man'' from May 28, 1921 through July 30, 1921. This was a much shorter version of the  original leaving out much of the [[backstory]] and [[Characterisation|character development]]. This shorter version was published as a [[book]] by [[Harper Brothers]] in 1921.

==Plot introduction==
A story of a feud between two families, the evil it causes, and the power of love to transcend all.

==Plot summary==
The story begins with 24-year-old Jean Isbel in the last stages of a multi-week trip from Oregon to the frontier in Arizona where his family had moved four years earlier to start a cattle ranch. As he nears his destination he meets a woman in the woods, and falls in love at first sight. As they part they learn that they are mortal enemies. She is Ellen Jorth, and her family is locked in a deadly feud with his.

Jean dreads the part his father, Gaston, wants him to play in the feud. He can’t get Ellen out of his mind. They meet again and his words awake in her doubt and fear that her father, Lee Jorth, is not an honorable man but in fact a horse thief and cattle rustler. As events unfold her fears are proved true. Through thick and thin Jean Isbel defends Ellen’s honor and believes the best of her.

The feud erupts into fatal gun battles, first at the Isbel ranch house, and then at the general store in the nearby town. Most of the Isbel and Jorth clans are killed, with several of their allies. The remnant of the Jorths flee with Ellen in tow to a hide-out hidden in a deep box cañon.

Jean and his allies track them and there is a deadly gun battle in the woods nearby. Ellen is forced by one of the three remaining Jorth allies to flee once again. During their flight their horse is shot out from under them. Ellen now on foot meets one of the dying Isbels and finally learns the certain truth that her father, family, and their allies were horse thieves and cattle rustlers as she feared.

When she finally makes her way back to the hide-out, she arrives just after Jean has been forced to take refuge in the loft, unknown to her. One of the two remaining rustlers attacks her with rape in mind but is interrupted by the arrival of the other rustler. Ellen discovers Jean during this interruption. When the rustler returns a few minutes later, Ellen is forced to kill him to protect herself and Jean. A minute later Jean kills the last rustler.

The story ends with Jean and Ellen declaring their love for each other.

==Themes==
The book is concerned with the destruction deadly violence wreaks on those family members who survive. Grey writes about the intense concern Jean feels for the impact the violence will have on the wives and children whose husbands and fathers will die in the feud.

The feud is caused by a love triangle between Gaston Isbel, Lee Jorth, and Ellen the woman both love, and the mother of Ellen Jorth. The story explores how love, betrayal, and jealousy can engender a hate which leads two men to destroy their families, without a thought to the pain and suffering of those relatives who will be left to bury the dead.

Ellen grows from a naïve girl to a woman of understanding under the severe trial of the events which overtake her. She begins to examine critically her own behavior with wisdom and insight. She grows and matures emotionally and psychologically, becoming aware that her father whom she had supported with unquestioning trust, is in fact a scoundrel, a thief, and a thoroughly dishonorable rogue. At the end she acts decisively and fatally to protect herself, her virtue, and the man she loves.

==Publication==
In the early 1990s, [[Jon Tuska]], was researching the [[filmography]] of Zane Grey. During this research he discovered that ''[[Last of the Duanes (novel)|Last of the Duanes]]'' and ''[[Rangers of the Lone Star]]'' were much altered from the [[holograph]] found "in the bottom drawer of a file cabinet in the Zane Grey, Inc. room where it had survived for eighty years.".&lt;ref&gt;Grey, Zane: "Tonto Basin", (quote from the ''Foreword'' by Jon Tuska) page 8. Five Star, 2004. {{ISBN|978-1-59414-050-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused him to request that they "tell me of any other manuscripts...that had  met a similar fate."&lt;ref&gt;Grey, Zane: "Tonto Basin", (quote from the ''Foreword'' by Jon Tuska) page 9. Five Star, 2004. {{ISBN|978-1-59414-050-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The result was the discovery of the complete holographic [[manuscript]] of the novel ''[[To the Last Man (Zane Grey)|To the Last Man]]''. A comparison of the holograph with ''To the Last Man'' revealed that the holograph was much longer, and contained detail which altered the meaning of the story. The complete uncut version was published in 2004.

The term '''use error''' has recently been introduced to replace the commonly used terms '''[[human error]]''' and '''[[user error]]'''. The new term, which has already been adopted by [[international standard]]s organizations for [[medical device]]s (see [[#Use errors in health care]] below for references), suggests that [[accident]]s should be attributed to the circumstances, rather than to the human beings who happened to be there.

==The need for the terminological change==
The term "use error" was first used in May 1995 in an [[MD+DI]] guest editorial,  [http://www.mddionline.com/article/issue-use-not-user-error “The Issue Is ‘Use,’ Not ‘User,’ Error,”] by [http://biomed.tamu.edu/people/faculty.php?lname=Hyman William Hyman].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mddionline.com/article/issue-use-not-user-error&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, human errors are considered as a special aspect of [[human factors]]. Accordingly, they are attributed to the human [[Computer operator|operator]], or [[user (computing)|user]].
When taking this approach, we assume that the system design is perfect, and the only source for the use errors is the human operator. For example, the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] (DoD) [[HFACS]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://uscg.mil/careercentral/cg113/docs/ergo_hfacs/hfacs.pdf], Department of Defense Human Factors Analysis and Classification System: A mishap investigation and data analysis tool&lt;/ref&gt; 
classifies use errors attributed to the human operator, disregarding improper design and configuration setting, which often result in missing [[alarms]], or in inappropriate [[alert messaging|alerting]].

The need for changing the term was due to a common [[malpractice]] of the [[Project stakeholder|stakeholder]]s (the responsible organizations, the authorities, journalists) in cases of accidents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lu.se/upload/Trafikflyghogskolan/TR2002-01_ReInventionofHumanError.pdf], Dekker: Reinvention of Human Error&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of investing in fixing the error-prone design, management attributed the error to the users.
The need for the change has been pointed out by the accident investigators: 
* Early in 1983, Erik Hollnagel&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; pointed out that the term Human Error refers to the outcome, not to the cause. A user action is typically classified as an error only if the results are painful &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ida.liu.se/~eriho/Bellagio_M.htm], Hollnagel: Why "Human Error" is a Meaningless Concept&lt;/ref&gt; 
* In the story “Leap of Faith” of his book “Set Phasers on Stun”,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aegeanpublishing.com/phaser1.html], Steve Casey: Set Phasers on Stun&lt;/ref&gt; Steve Casey suggested that the accident of the [[Indian Airlines Flight 605]] near Bangalor in 1990 could have been avoided, should the investigators of the [[Air France Flight 296]] accident of 1988 past the Mulhouse-Habsheim airport considered the circumstances (exceptional situation), rather than the pilots (human errors).
* In his book “Managing the Risks of Organizational Accidents” ([[Organizational models of accidents]]) James Reason explained and demonstrated that often, the circumstances for accidents could have been controlled by the responsible organization, and not by the operators. 
* In his book “The Field Guide to Understanding Human Errors”,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashgate.com/isbn/9780754648260],  Sidney Dekker:  The Field Guide to Understanding Human Error&lt;/ref&gt; Sidney Dekker argued that blaming the operators according to “The Old View” results in defensive behavior of operators, which hampers the efforts to learn from near-misses and from accidents.

==Use errors vs. force majeure==
A mishap is typically considered as either a use error or a force majeure:
&lt;ref name="Weiler"&gt;[http://avi.har-el.com/eng/Articles/ITS-Alarms-Apr2011.pdf], Weiler and Harel: Managing the Risks of Use Errors: The ITS Warning Systems Case Study&lt;/ref&gt;
* A use error is a mishap in which a human operator is involved. Typically, such mishaps are attributed to the failure of the human operator &lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.ashgate.com/isbn/9780754648260], Dekker, 2007: The Field Guide to Understanding Human Error
&lt;/ref&gt; 
* A force majeure is a mishap that does not involve a human being in the chain of events preceding the event.

==Use errors in health care==
In 1998, Cook, Woods and Miller presented the concept of [[hindsight bias]], exemplified by celebrated accidents in medicine, by a workgroup on patient safety
.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.ctlab.org/documents/A%20Tale%20of%20Two%20Stories.pdf], Cook RI, Woods DD, Miller C [1998] A Tale of Two Stories: Contrasting Views of Patient Safety
&lt;/ref&gt;
The workgroup pointed at the tendency to attribute accidents in health care to isolated human failures.
They provide references to early research about the effect of knowledge of the outcome, which was unavailable beforehand, on later judgement about the processes that led up to that outcome. They explain that in looking back, we tend to oversimplify the situation that the actual practitioners faces. They conclude focusing on the hindsight knowledge prevents our understanding of the richer story, the circumstances of the human error.

According to this position, the term Use Error is formally defined in several [[international standard]]s, such as [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 62366, [[ISO 14155]] and [[ISO 14971]], to describe
: ''an act or omission of an act that results in a different medical device response than intended by the manufacturer or expected by the user.''

[[ISO standards]] about medical devices and procedures provide examples of use errors, which are attributed to human factors, include slips, [[lapses]] and mistakes. Practically, this means that they are attributed to the user, implying the user’s accountability.
The  U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] glossary of medical devices provides the following explanation about this term:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/GeneralHospitalDevicesandSupplies/InfusionPumps/ucm202502.htm], FDA, Medical Devices, Glossary&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Safe and effective use of a medical device means that users do not make errors that lead to injury and they achieve the desired medical treatment. If safe and effective use is not achieved, use error has occurred. Why and how use error occurs is a [[human factors]] concern."

With this interpretation by ISO and the FDA, the term ‘use error’ is actually synonymous with ‘user error’.
Another approach, which distinguishes ‘use errors’ from ‘user errors', is taken by IEC 62366. Annex A includes an explanation justifying the new term:
:"This International Standard uses the concept of use error. This term was chosen over the more commonly used term of “human error” because not all errors associated with the use of medical device are the result of oversight or carelessness of the part of the user of the medical device. Much more commonly, use errors are the direct result of poor user interface design."

This explanation complies with “The New View”, which Sidney Dekker suggested as an alternative to “The Old View”. This interpretation favors investigations intended to understand the situation, rather than blaming the operators.

In a 2011 report draft on health IT usability, the U.S. [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) defines "use error" in healthcare IT this way: “Use error is a term used very specifically to refer to user interface designs that will engender users to make errors of commission or omission. It is true that users do make errors, but many errors are due not to user error per se but due to designs that are flawed, e.g., poorly written messaging, misuse of color-coding conventions, omission of information, etc.".&lt;ref&gt;''NISTIR 7804: Technical Evaluation, Testing and Validation of the Usability of Electronic Health Records, Draft, Sept. 2011, pg. 10. '' [https://www.nist.gov/healthcare/usability/upload/Draft_EUP_09_28_11.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Example of user error ===
An example of an accident due to a user error is the ecological disaster of 1967 caused by the [[Torrey Canyon]] supertanker. The accident was due to a combination of several exceptional events, the result of which was that the supertanker was heading directly to the rocks. At that point, the captain failed to change the course because the steering control lever was inadvertently set to the Control position, which disconnected the rudder from the wheel at the helm.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Casey, A memento of your service, in Set Phasers on Stun, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples of user failure to handle system failure===
Examples of the second type are the [[Three Mile Island accident]] described above, the [[New York City blackout of 1977|NYC blackout]] following a storm and the chemical plant disaster in Bhopal, India ([[Bhopal Disaster]]).

==Classifying use errors==
The URM Model &lt;ref name="Task-oriented"&gt;
[http://avi.har-el.com/eng/Articles/Task-Oriented-SE.pdf], Zonnenshain &amp; Harel: Task-oriented SE, INCOSE 2009 Conference, Singapore&lt;/ref&gt; characterizes use errors in terms of the user’s failure to manage a system deficiency. Six categories of use errors are described in a URM document:
#Expected faults with risky results;
#Expected faults with unexpected results;
#Expected user errors in identifying risky situations (this study);
#User Errors in handling expected faults;
#Expected errors in function selection;
#Unexpected faults, due to operating in exceptional states.

==Critics==
Erik Hollnagel argues that going from and 'old' view to a 'new' view is not enough. One should go all the way to a 'no' view. This means that the notion of error, whether user error or use error might be destructive rather than constructive. 
Instead, he proposes to focus on the performance variability of everyday actions, on the basis that this performance variability is both useful and necessary. In most cases the result is that things go right, in a few cases that things go wrong. But the reason is the same.
