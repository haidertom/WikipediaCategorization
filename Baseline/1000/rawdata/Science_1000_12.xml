The '''American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine''' ('''A4M''') is a [[United States]] registered [[501(c)(3)]] nonprofit organization that promotes the questionable field of [[anti-aging medicine]] and trains and certifies physicians in this specialty. As of 2011, approximately 26,000 practitioners had been given certificates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fontenot|first=Cliff|title=Dr Ronald Klatz's Interview With The Anti Aging Source|url=http://www.anti-aging-source.com/dr-ronald-klatz.html|work=Interview|publisher=The Anti Aging Source|accessdate=March 24, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904040456/http://www.anti-aging-source.com/dr-ronald-klatz.html|archivedate=September 4, 2011|df=mdy-all}}{{Self-published source|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The field of anti-aging medicine is not recognized by established medical organizations, such as the [[American Board of Medical Specialties]] (ABMS) and the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA). The Academy's activities include lobbying and public relations. The A4M was founded in 1993 by [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|osteopathic physicians]] [[Robert Goldman (osteopath)|Robert Goldman]] and [[Ronald Klatz]],&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;

The organization sponsors several conferences, including the [[Annual World Congress on Anti-Aging Medicine]].&lt;ref name=A4Mwebsite&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldhealth.net/pages/about |title=About A4M - WorldHealth.net |publisher=American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine |accessdate=September 5, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130222123135/http://www.worldhealth.net/pages/about |archivedate=February 22, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of the anti-aging methods recommended by the Academy have wide support among experts in the field, such as exercise and a healthy diet, but others, such as [[hormone treatment]]s, do not have support from a consensus of the wider medical community. Many scientists studying aging dissociate themselves from the claims of A4M,&lt;ref name=Mykytyn2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=LATimes2004/&gt; and critics have accused the group of using misleading marketing to sell expensive and ineffective products.&lt;ref name=SilverFleece/&gt; The A4M's founders and merchants who promote products through the organization have been involved in legal and [[professional dispute]]s.

The activities of the A4M are controversial: in 2003 a commentary on the response of the [[scientific community]] to the promotion of anti-aging medicine noted that the activities of the A4M were seen as a threat to the credibility of serious scientific research on aging.&lt;ref name=Binstock&gt;{{Cite journal

Writing in the 2001 issue of the journal ''Generations'', historian Carole Haber of the [[University of Delaware]], states that Klatz' aspirations  and the rhetoric of the A4M "reflect well-worn ideas and the often-enunciated hopes of the past", drawing parallels with the ideas of the 19th century [[physiologist]]s [[Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard]], [[Serge Voronoff]] and [[Eugen Steinach]]. Haber states that the current resurgence of these ideas may be due to their appeal to the aging [[Baby Boom Generation]], in a culture that is focused on the ideal of youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Haber has also discussed the strong continuities within the philosophy of the anti-aging movement, writing that "For Steinach and Voronoff, as for the members of the A4M, old age was a "grotesque" disease that could be scientifically eradicated through the correct combination of hormones, diet, and surgery."&lt;ref name=Haber2004&gt;{{cite journal |author=Haber C |title=Life extension and history: the continual search for the fountain of youth |journal=J.

==Activities==
The main activity of the A4M is PR and advocacy for its brand of anti-aging medicine. It does this through publications, on-line activity and sponsoring conferences including the World Anti-Aging Congress and Exposition and the Annual World Congress on Anti-Aging Medicine.&lt;ref name=LATimes2004/&gt; Some of these conferences are in conjunction with the World Anti-Aging Academy of Medicine, an umbrella group for several national anti-aging organizations that is also headed by Goldman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

According to a review of the anti-aging movement published in 2005, the A4M is one of the most prominent organizations that are making "attempts at legitimizing anti-aging as a medical specialty".&lt;ref name=Mykytyn&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review notes that these efforts at legitimization are contentious and have been rebuffed by some academic scientists who work on aging, who instead attempt to portray the A4M as "charlatans whose main goal is making money".&lt;ref name=Mykytyn/&gt; In a review of the history of anti-aging medicine published in 2004, Robert Binstock of [[Case Western Reserve University]] noted that A4M "actively solicits and displays numerous advertisements on its website for products and services (such as cosmetics and alternative medicines and therapies), anti-aging clinics, and anti-aging physicians and practitioners."&lt;ref name=Binstock/&gt; ''[[The Times]]'' reported in 2004 that Klatz professes outrage at suggestions that he is motivated by money, quoting him as insisting that "The only thing that I sell are books...my website is non-commercial – we’re just trying to advance science."&lt;ref name=Times&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/features/article477626.ece?token=null&amp;offset=0&amp;page=1 Want to live for ever?] ''The Times'' September 4, 2004 [https://www.webcitation.org/5joIrSNfm?url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/features/article477626.ece?token%3Dnull%26offset%3D0%26page%3D1 archive url, page 1] [https://www.webcitation.org/5joJ1YRKM?url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/features/article477626.ece?token=null&amp;offset=12&amp;page=2 archive url, page 2], Accessed September 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Times'' went on to note a partnership between Klatz and Goldman and a business named [[Market America]], which sells products that promise to "slow the ageing process".&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-22721248_ITM Market America Refuses to Grow Old Gracefully; Company Launches Anti-Aging Store at Recent Conference.] ''PR Newswire'' March 18, 2003 [https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-98898617.html cached copy]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Accessed September 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to a 2005 article in the ''Chicago Tribune'', the company later pulled out of this contract.&lt;ref name=ChicagoTribune/&gt;

The A4M's American Board of Anti-Aging Medicine (ABAAM) states that it offers anti-aging medicine as a specialty and gives educational credits to those who attend A4M conferences. ''The New York Times'' has reported that the [[American Board of Medical Specialties]] does not recognize this body as having professional standing.&lt;ref name="NYTPoison"/&gt; MSNBC noted that "as far as the American Medical Association or the American Board of Medical Specialties is concerned, there is no such thing as an anti-aging specialty."&lt;ref name="MSNBC"/&gt; Robert Binstock stated in a 2004 review article in ''The Gerontologist'' that "Although the organization is not recognized by the American Medical Association, A4M has established three board-certification programs under its auspices—for physicians, chiropractors, dentists, naturopaths, podiatrists, pharmacists, registered nurses, nurse practitioners, nutritionists, dieticians, sports trainers and fitness consultants, and PhDs."&lt;ref name=Binstock/&gt;

==Publications==
The A4M publishes ''Anti Aging Medical News'', a trade periodical which is their official magazine, as well as proceedings of its anti-aging conferences in a periodical called ''Anti-Aging Therapeutics'', this is edited by Klatz and Goldman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://locatorplus.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?Search_Arg=Anti-Aging+Therapeutics&amp;Search_Code=TKEY&amp;PID=xil-2-KGq5dNtEPBS5tbrIB8Or3&amp;SEQ=20090920152743&amp;CNT=10&amp;HIST=1 Anti-aging therapeutics] ''National Library of Medicine'', Accessed September 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divergent views on anti-aging products==

According to a 2002 article in the ''[[Seattle Times]]'', there are two opposing viewpoints of anti-aging products. The article states that the first view is represented by scientists who publish their findings in the [[scientific literature]] and who believe that no currently available intervention can slow or prevent aging. The alternative viewpoint is represented by people who the article states have "fewer credentials" and who promote a range of products that claim to have anti-aging properties.&lt;ref name=Garreau&gt;Joel Garreau [http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20021019&amp;slug=aging19 Holding back the years: Scientists say extended youth may be near] ''Seattle Times'' 2002, Accessed September 28, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; A similar observation was made by ''[[Business Week]]'' in 2006, when they stated that although anti-aging medicine is increasingly popular, there is "precious little scientific data to back up their claims that the potions extend life."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_12/b3976001.htm? Selling The Promise Of Youth] cover story ''[[Business Week]]'' March 20, 2006, Accessed September 28, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example of the first viewpoint, a 2004 review in ''[[Trends in Biotechnology]]'' written by Leigh Turner of the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]] stated that the products promoted by the A4M have "no credible scientific basis" and that "there are no proven, scientifically established ‘anti-aging’ medications".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The alternative view is held by the A4M, who argue that anti-aging medicine is "evidence-based, clinically sound health care." and state that "only those diagnostic and treatment elements which prove their validity through independent evaluations are embraced by the A4M."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldhealth.net/about-anti-aging-medicine/introduction-anti-aging-medicine/ Introduction to Anti-Aging Medicine] American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine, Accessed September 28, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Seattle Times'' quotes Klatz as describing those who doubt the validity of anti-aging medicine as "flat-earthers" who make unjustified criticisms that are not backed by scientific evidence, the article also states that Klatz "sees the science and medical establishments as out to get him."&lt;ref name=Garreau/&gt;  Though he has been quoted as saying, "I’m not against the AMA and I’m not against the establishment, I’m really for the establishment, I’m for technology I’m for science-based medicine.

===Human growth hormone controversy===
{{Main|HGH controversies}}
The American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine was formed following a 1990 study on [[human growth hormone]] (hGH) that was published in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]''.&lt;ref name="MSNBC"/&gt; The study was performed by Daniel Rudman and colleagues at the [[Medical College of Wisconsin]]. Rudman had treated twelve men over 60 years of age with human growth hormone; after six months, these men had an increase in lean body mass and a decrease in adipose tissue mass when compared with a group of nine men who did not receive hormone.&lt;ref name=Rudman&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Members of the anti-aging movement have interpreted these results to support a role for growth hormone in slowing or reversing aging. A review in ''The Journal of Urology'' noted that this promotion of growth hormone as an anti-aging remedy is "arguably similar" to ideas that date back to the late 19th century, when the physiologist [[Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard]] advocated rejuvenating hormone products prepared from animal testicles and stated that "the injections have taken 30 years off my life".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

''The New York Times'' reports that the idea that growth hormone can improve "health, energy level and sense of well-being." is a core belief of the A4M,&lt;ref name="NYTPoison"/&gt; with Klatz writing a book in 1998 entitled ''Grow Young with HGH: The Amazing Medically Proven Plan to Reverse Aging'' where he states "The ‘Fountain of Youth’ lies within the cells of each of us.

In fact, he was horrified his study was being used to support the industry especially since heavy use of growth hormone can have unwanted side effects".&lt;ref name="MSNBC"/&gt;

''The New York Times'' states that medical authorities not affiliated with the A4M question the safety and efficacy of the use of growth hormone in anti-aging medicine, quoting Michael Fossell of [[Michigan State University]] who stated that "hormone therapies are the new patent medicines – cure-alls embraced by a too-trusting public."&lt;ref name="NYTPoison"/&gt;  A 2003 review that was published in the ''[[Annual Reviews (publisher)|Annual Review of Medicine]]'' noted that the long-term risks or benefits of this treatment are uncertain, that "neither the benefits nor the dangers have been defined" and advising that a "prudent physician should not condone the use of GH for normal aging".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

As a result of the reactions to the 1990 article and its frequent citation by proponents of HGH as an anti-aging agent, in 2003 the ''New England Journal of Medicine'' published two articles that strongly and clearly stated that there was insufficient medical and scientific evidence to support use of HGH as anti-aging drug. One article was written by the ''Journal'''s then-editor in chief, Jeffrey M. Drazen, M.D. and was entitled, "Inappropriate Advertising of Dietary Supplements".&lt;ref name= "Dietary Supplements 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Jeffrey |first=M.

The other article was written by the editor-in-chief at the time the 1990 article was published, Mary Lee Vance, M.D., and was entitled, "Can Growth Hormone Prevent Aging?"; it focused more on the medical issues around whether there was sufficient evidence to use HGH as an anti-aging agent.&lt;ref name= "Hormone Prevent Aging 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Mary Lee |first= Vance |title= Can Growth Hormone Prevent Aging? |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |date=February 2003 |doi=10.1056/NEJMp020186 |pmid=12606731 |volume=348 |issue=9 |pages=779–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2007 review on the use of human growth hormone as an anti-aging treatment in healthy elderly people published in the ''[[Annals of Internal Medicine]]'' concluded the risks of HGH significantly outweigh the benefits, noted [[edema|soft tissue edema]] as a common side effect and found no evidence that the hormone prolongs life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Dispute with Olshansky and Perls===
In 2002, A4M was a co-recipient of the first "Silver Fleece Award," created to publicize "the most ridiculous claims about antiaging medicine" according to the award's inventor, [[S. Jay Olshansky]].&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Davenport, "And the Loser Is ...: Silver Fleece Awards 'honor' antiaging quackery (Questionable therapies)", Science's SAGE KE, February 20, 2002, Accessed January 12, 2015 [http://sageke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/2002/7/nw21]&lt;/ref&gt; Heated legal and academic controversies ensued. Olshansky, a [[demography|biodemographer]] at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]], described it as "a lighthearted attempt to make the public aware of...anti-aging quackery".&lt;ref name=Binstock/&gt; This "award" was presented by Olshansky, who stated that in his opinion, a "suite of anti-aging substances created by Ronald Klatz and Robert Goldman...and sold on the Internet by Market America, Inc." had made "outrageous or exaggerated claims about slowing or reversing human aging".&lt;ref name=Mykytyn2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=SilverFleece&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in ''Biogerontology'', anthropologist Courtney Mykytyn of the [[University of Southern California]] states that this award appears to have been an attempt by Olshansky to protect what he saw as "'real' science from the taint of swindle." Mykytyn states that this involved Olshansky "tagging the A4M as fraudulent and its principals as profiteers".&lt;ref name=Mykytyn2006/&gt; In response, the Academy filed defamation lawsuits, demanding $150 million in damages, with Klatz stating "We take great exception to Mr Olshansky and his tactics which have finally compelled us to file suit for various unprofessional and improper actions".&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; Klatz and Goldman described this action as "part of a larger campaign of disparagement by Olshansky and Perls aimed at discrediting A4M and its founders".&lt;ref name=Deposition/&gt; The ''Chicago Tribune'' quoted experts on libel law who stated that the action was an "almost unheard-of attempt to punish academics for comments made in their professional capacity".&lt;ref name=ChicagoTribune&gt;Jeremy Manier [http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/health/2002344052_antisuit22.html Professor sued over opinion of anti-aging group] ''Chicago Tribune'' June 22, 2005, [https://www.webcitation.org/5jobHQcH7?url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/health/2002344052_antisuit22.html archived url], Accessed September 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; ''CNN'' states that Olshansky countersued and that "both sides eventually agreed to drop their cases".&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt; The ''Chicago Tribune'' states that the case "ended in a settlement, with neither side paying damages or the other's costs."&lt;ref&gt;Judith Graham [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-154704020.html Legal dispute over anti-aging medicine ends.] ''Chicago Tribune'' November 17, 2006, Accessed September 14, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Olshansky, Hayflick, and Carnes published a position paper, endorsed by 51 scientists in the field of aging, stating that "no currently marketed intervention has yet been proved to slow, stop or reverse human aging...The entrepreneurs, physicians and other health care practitioners who make these claims are taking advantage of consumers who cannot easily distinguish between the hype and reality of interventions designed to influence the aging process and age-related diseases,".&lt;ref name="PositionStatement"&gt;

Zs-Nagy defended therapies promoted by A4M, which he states are related to his own "membrane hypothesis of aging", as theoretically feasible. He described the conflict between the scientific community and the Academy as one pitting government funds, "personal gain" and "intellectual dishonesty" against the "independent, open-minded approach" of A4M, calling the conflict one of the "biggest scandals of the recent history of medicine".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

'''Arthur Good''' (16&lt;ref name="Geneanet"/&gt; or 26&lt;ref name="BNF"&gt;{{cite web|title=Catalogue Général|url=http://catalogue.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb12058496c|website=BnF (nouvelle fenêtre)|accessdate=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; August 1853 – 30 March 1928) was a French engineer,&lt;ref name="Lachapelle" /&gt; science educator, author and caricaturist who used the pen name '''Tom Tit'''.  He wrote a series of weekly articles, ''La Science Amusante'', or ''Amusing Science'', that were collected in book form and have been translated and republished in more than 130 editions in several languages.  The illustrations for his do-it-yourself scientific apparatuses have been described as [[surrealist]] [[collages]], and were an inspiration for surrealist artists such as [[Max Ernst]] and [[Joseph Cornell]].

== Personal life ==
Arthur Good was born in [[Montivilliers]], [[Seine-Maritime]], [[France]] on 16&lt;ref name="Geneanet"/&gt; or 26&lt;ref name="BNF"/&gt; August 1853. He was the son of Protestant pastor Gustave Frédéric Good (1823–1896) and Louise Stéphanie Monod (1827–1909).&lt;ref name="Geneanet"&gt;{{cite web|title=Arthur Good|url=http://gw.geneanet.org/bourelly?lang=fr&amp;p=arthur&amp;n=good|website=Geneanet|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Good graduated from the [[École Centrale Paris|École centrale des arts et manufacture]] in [[Paris]], where he studied engineering.&lt;ref name="Chemineau" /&gt;

He married Jeanne Valon (1857–1910) in Paris on 6 April 1881. They had four children.&lt;ref name="Geneanet" /&gt;

Under the pen name Tom Tit, Arthur Good wrote a series of weekly articles, ''La Science Amusante'', or ''Amusing Science'', for the French magazine ''L’Illustration''.&lt;ref name="Edelman" /&gt; Good presented a range of physical experiments, from "simple games meant to amuse the family" to experiments "of a truly scientific character". They introduce a range of physical and scientific principles&lt;ref name="Lachapelle"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lachapelle|first1=Sofie|title=Conjuring Science: A History of Scientific Entertainment and Stage Magic in Modern France|date=2015|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-137-49768-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HB7eCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT62|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[magnetism]] and [[surface tension]].&lt;ref name="Elder"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elder|first1=R.

He dedicated ''La Science Amusante'' to one of his children, saying "In dedicating this volume today, I would like it to be a souvenir for you of the happy moments we have spent together trying the experiments and constructing the apparatuses".&lt;ref name="Lachapelle" /&gt;

Good created improvised scientific apparatuses like his ''Soap-bubble Chandelier'' using common items such as bottles, eggs, corks, candles, and soap.&lt;ref name="Edelman" /&gt;  His constructions have an imaginative charm that has led to them being compared to surrealistic collages.&lt;ref name="Edelman" /&gt;  Nonetheless, his drawings were seriously and carefully rendered by scientific engraver [[Louis Poyet]] (1846–1913) and his assistants.&lt;ref name="Edelman"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Edelman|first1=Eric|title=The Collaged World of Tom Tit|url=http://blog.retrocollage.com/collaged-world-tom-tit/|website=RetroCollage|accessdate=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Poyet"&gt;{{cite web|title=Le graveur du dimanche * Louis Poyet|url=http://gonefishing.over-blog.com/article-le-graveur-du-dimanche-louis-poyet-48802161.html|website=Gone Fishing|date=18 April 2010|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original columns from ''La Science Amusante'' were collected and published in a three-volume series in France. Each volume contained 100 amusements. Beginning in 1889,&lt;ref name="Lachapelle" /&gt; they have been reprinted in over 130 editions.&lt;ref name="Elder" /&gt; Collections of amusements were translated and published in English, Italian, and Spanish.&lt;ref name="Edelman" /&gt; In the United States they appeared as ''Magical Experiments, or Science in Play'', and in England as ''Scientific Amusements''. A selection has also been republished as ''100 Amazing Magic Tricks''.&lt;ref name="Elder" /&gt;  Good's books are considered to have laid the foundations for  modern approaches to science education in their introduction of "kitchen science" and hands-on experiments for children.&lt;ref name="Buxton"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Buxton |first1=Cory A. |last2=Provenzo, Jr. |first2=Eugene F. |title=Teaching Science in Elementary and Middle School: A Cognitive and Cultural Approach |publisher=Sage |year=2007 |page=44 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3aqDhzUdLS4C&amp;pg=PA44 |oclc=72353389 |isbn=978-1-4129-2497-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bioindustry Park Silvano Fumero''' (BiPCa) is a [[Science park|Science and Technology Park]] located in [[Canavese]] near [[Turin]] in the north-west of [[Italy]].
The park was founded to promote and develop [[biotechnological]] research, to host companies operating [[research and development]], and pilot production in the [[life science]] sector. Companies such as [[Serono|Merck Serono]] and Bracco chose the Park as the location for their research and development activities.

==Services==
The Park offers a complete set of support services to R&amp;D activities, not only offering research facilities and scientific services, but also flexible and attractive financing solutions, sound project management and results evaluation. 

The park is the owner of the '''Laboratory for Advanced Methodologies''' (LIMA) which performs exploitation of scientific results in the fields of [[Chemistry]], [[Molecular Biology]], [[Proteomics]] and [[Bioinformatics]]. LIMA, thanks to its solid co-operation with the [[University of Turin]] and CNR ISPA ([[Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche]]), is also a permanent training site for graduates and researchers. 

A University Center in Imaging Technologies ('''CEIP''') managed by University of Torino is also active and is focused on the use of different technologies ([[MRI]], [[Ultrasound]], [[X-ray]], etc.) in order to evaluate new solutions in the diagnosis and assessment of the efficacy and efficiency of [[drug]]s.

==Start-ups==
In 2005 BiPCa has launched, with the support of [[Regions of Italy|Regione]] [[Piemonte]], the '''Discovery''' initiative to identify and select innovative entrepreneurial ideas in the Biotech field. Eight start-ups have already been created from the beginning of the project in partnership with Eporgen venture, a [[Seed capital]] company focused on investment in new innovative entrepreneurial projects in the biotech field.

==Local cluster==
Bioindustry Park is also acting as system integrator for the development of a [[Business cluster|local cluster]], bioPmed (http://www.biopmed.eu).
Since 2009 Bioindustry Park acts as cluster management company for the development of the regional cluster bioPmed (www.biopmed.eu) on biotech and medtech. Created thanks to Regione Piemonte, it gathers more than 60 companies, research centres and three academic institutions (University of Turin, Università del Piemonte Orientale and  [[Turin Polythecnic]]), who signed an agreement to create, build, support and animate the local cluster. 

All the activities are carried out in cooperation with strong local actors, such as Turin Province and Turin Chamber of Commerce, CEIPiemonte, ALPS EEN and Patlib network and synergies with other local R&amp;D initiatives are in place. The cluster is also founding member of the AlpsBioCluster (www.alpsbiocluster.eu) together with [[ Rhône-Alpes]] Region (France), Lombardy, South Tirol, Bavaria  and Western Switzerland that intends to promote and foster transalpine competitiveness in the biotech and [[medical science]]s sectors.

[[File:Love what you do.jpg|thumb|300x300px|A biochemist engaged in bench research]]

'''Biomedical sciences''' are a set of [[applied science]]s applying portions of [[natural science]] or [[formal science]], or both, to  knowledge, interventions, or technology that are of use in [[healthcare]] or [[public health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Consultations/Liveconsultations/DH_091137?IdcService=GET_FILE&amp;dID=181510&amp;Rendition=Web |title=The Future of the Healthcare Science Workforce. Modernising Scientific Careers: The Next Steps. |page=2 |accessdate=1 June 2011 |date=26 Nov 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such disciplines as [[medical microbiology]], [[clinical virology]], [[clinical epidemiology]], [[genetic epidemiology]], and [[biomedical engineering]] are medical sciences.  In explaining [[physiology|physiological]] mechanisms operating in [[pathology|pathological processes]], however, [[pathophysiology]] can be regarded as [[basic science]].

==Roles within biomedical science==
There are at least 45 different specialisms within healthcare science, which are traditionally grouped into three main divisions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/@dh/@en/@ps/documents/digitalasset/dh_117982.pdf |title=Extraordinary You |publisher=Department of Health|page=116 |accessdate=1 June 2011 |date=16 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biomedical science in the United Kingdom ==
The healthcare science workforce is an important part of the UK's [[National Health Service]]. While people working in healthcare science are only 5% of the staff of the NHS, 80% of all diagnoses can be attributed to their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_113275 |title=Modernising Scientific Careers: The UK Way Forward |page=3 |accessdate=1 June 2011 |date=26 Feb 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The volume of specialist healthcare science work is a significant part of the work of the NHS. Every year, NHS healthcare scientists carry out:
* nearly 1 billion pathology laboratory tests
* more than 12 million physiological tests
* support for 1.5 million [[Radiation therapy|fractions]] of radiotherapy

The four governments of the UK have recognised the importance of healthcare science to the NHS, introducing the [[Modernising Scientific Careers]] initiative to make certain that the education and training for healthcare scientists ensures there is the flexibility to meet patient needs while keeping up to date with scientific developments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_113275 |title=Modernising Scientific Careers: The UK Way Forward |page=5 |accessdate=1 June 2011 |date=26 Feb 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="71449">Several Asian countries have [[List of space agencies|space programs]] and are actively competing to achieve scientific and technological advancements in [[outer space|space]], a situation sometimes referred to as the '''Asian space race''' in the popular media&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/id/160037 ]&lt;/ref&gt; as a reference to the earlier [[Space Race]] between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]]. Like the previous space race, issues involved in the current push to space include [[national security]], which has spurred many countries to send artificial [[satellite]]s as well as [[human spaceflight|humans]] into [[Geocentric orbit|Earth orbit]] and beyond.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; A number of Asian countries are seen as contenders in the ongoing race to be the pre-eminent power in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Asia Nations Gaining Ground in Space Race| url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/library/news/2007/space-070517-voa01.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asian space powers==
{{See also|Timeline of first orbital launches by country}}

Of the ten countries that have independently [[Timeline of first orbital launches by country|successfully launched a satellite into orbit]], six are Asian: China, India, [[Iran]], Israel, Japan and [[North Korea]].

China's first manned spacecraft entered orbit in October 2003, making China the first Asian nation to [[human spaceflight|send a human]] into space.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news
 | title = China puts its first man in space
 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3192330.stm | work=BBC News | date=2003-10-15 | accessdate=2010-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

India is expected  to demonstrate independent human spaceflight by 2020 and human landing on the moon by 2030,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.indianexpress.com/news/plan-panel-okays-isro-manned-space-flight/426945/= | title = Planning Commission Okays ISRO Manned Space Flight Program}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Iran and Japan have plans for independent manned spaceflights around 2020. China is also still predicting manned mission to the Earth moon by 2025 and to Mars by 2050.

While the achievements of space programs run by the main Asian space players (China, India, and Japan) pale in comparison to the milestones set by the former [[Soviet Union]] and the United States, some experts believe Asia may soon lead the world in space exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | title = Asia could win next 'Space Race', US scientists fear
 | url = http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Asia_could_win_next_Space_Race_US_scientists_fear_999.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; China has been the leader of Asia's space race since the beginning of the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

At the same time, the existence of a space race in Asia is still debated due to the non-concurrence of space milestone events like there was for the United States and the Soviet Union. Japan for example was the first power on Earth to get a sample return mission from an asteroid. There was however some concurrence between China and India to see which of those two could be the first to launch a probe to the Earth's moon back in the late 2000s decade. China, for example, denies that there is an Asian space race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

  | url = http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,307440,00.html | work=Fox News | date=2007-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In January 2007 China became the first Asian military-space power to send an [[anti-satellite]] missile into orbit, to destroy an aging Chinese Feng Yun 1C [[weather satellite]] in polar orbit. The resulting explosion sent a wave of debris hurtling through space at more than 6&amp;nbsp;miles per second.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite news

 | url = http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080220/NEWS07/80220105}}&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, [[JAXA|Japan's space agency]] launched an experimental communications satellite designed to enable super high-speed data transmission in remote areas.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

After successful achievement of [[geostationary]] technology, India's [[ISRO]] launched its first Moon mission, [[Chandrayaan-1]] in October 2008, which discovered [[Lunar water|ice water on the Moon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Heated Space Race Under Way in Asia| url = http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory?id=3041588}} ABC News&lt;/ref&gt; India then launched on 5 November 2013 its maiden interplanetary mission, the [[Mars Orbiter Mission]]. The primary objective is to determine Mars' atmospheric composition and attempt to detect methane. The spacecraft completed its journey on 24 September 2014 when it  entered its intended orbit around Mars, making India the first Asian country to successfully place a Mars orbiter and the only country in history to do so in the first attempt. ISRO became the fourth space agency in the world to send a spacecraft to Mars, only behind NASA, ROSMOS, and ESA.

In addition to increasing national pride, countries are commercially motivated to operate in space. Commercial satellites are launched for communications, weather forecasting, and atmospheric research. According to a report by the [[Space Frontier Foundation]] released in 2006, the "space economy" is estimated to be worth about $180&amp;nbsp;billion, with more than 60% of space-related economic activity coming from commercial goods and services.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite news

 | url = http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/10/05/ww.spacerace/index.html | work=CNN | date=2007-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; China and India propose the initiation of a commercial launch service.

===China===
{{Main article|Chinese space program}} 
China has a space program with an independent [[human spaceflight]] capability. It has developed a sizable family of successful [[Long March rockets]]. It has launched two lunar orbiters, [[Chang'e 1]] and [[Chang'e 2]]. On 2 December 2013, China launched a modified Long March 3B rocket, with [[Chang'e 3]] Moon lander and its rover Yutu on-board toward the Moon and successfully performed soft landing and rover operations, becoming the third country to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard David Space.com&lt;/ref&gt; It also has plans to retrieve samples by late 2017. In 2011, China embarked on a program to establish a manned [[space station]], starting with the launch of [[Tiangong 1]] and followed by [[Tiangong 2]] in 2016. China attempted to send a Mars orbiter ([[Yinghuo-1]]) in 2011 on a joint mission with Russia, which failed to leave Earth orbit. Nevertheless, the [[Mars Global Remote Sensing Orbiter and Small Rover|2020 Chinese Mars Mission]] with an orbiter, a lander and a rover has been approved by the government and is aiming a launch date in the year 2020.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; China has collaborative projects with Russia, [[ESA]], and [[Brazil]], and has launched commercial satellites for other countries. Some analysts suggest that the Chinese space program is linked to the nation's efforts at developing advanced military technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | title = China's man in space gets mixed reaction
 | url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn4276-chinas-man-in-space-gets-mixed-reaction.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

China's advanced technology is the result of the integration of various related technological experiences. Early Chinese satellites, such as the [[Fanhui Shi Weixing|FSW]] series, have undergone many [[atmospheric reentry]] tests. In the 1990s China had commercial launches, resulting in more launch experiences and a high success rate after the 1990s. China has aimed to undertake scientific development in fields like Solar System exploration. China's Shenzhou 7 spacecraft successfully performed an [[Extra-vehicular activity|EVA]] in September 2008. China's Shenzhou 9 spacecraft successfully performed a manned docking in June 2012. Furthermore, China's Chang'e 2 explorer became the first object to reach Sun-Earth Lagrangian point in August 2011 and also the first probe to explore both Moon and asteroid by making a flyby of the asteroid [[4179 Toutatis]]. China has launched [[Dark Matter Particle Explorer|DAMPE]], the most capable dark matter explorer to date in 2015, and world's first quantum communication satellite [[QUESS]] in 2016.

===India===

{{Main article|Indian Space Research Organisation}}

India's interest in space travel began in the early 1960s, when scientists launched a [[Nike-Apache]] rocket from [[Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station|TERLS]], [[Kerala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = The dawn of a new space race?| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4208176.stm | work=BBC News | date=2005-10-14 | accessdate=2010-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thebetterindia.com/74283/first-rocket-india-thumba-vikram-sarabhai-abdul-kalam/|title=Transported on a Bicycle, Launched from a Church: The Amazing Story of India's First Rocket Launch|date=2016-11-08|work=The Better India|access-date=2017-07-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Vikram Sarabhai]], the program focused on the practical uses of space in increasing the standard of living. Remote sensing and communications satellites were placed into orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = India Limbers Up for Space Race As Prime Minister Asks for the Moon| url = http://www.buzzle.com/editorials/1-29-2003-34579.asp| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20030202055414/http://www.buzzle.com/editorials/1-29-2003-34579.asp| dead-url = yes| archive-date = 2003-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Indian to travel in space was [[Rakesh Sharma]], who flew aboard [[Soyuz T-11]], launched April 2, 1984, from erstwhile [[Soviet Union|USSR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.aerospaceguide.net/astronaut/rakesh_sharma.html|title=Rakesh Sharma - First Indian in Space|date=2017-02-15|work=AeroSpaceGuide.net|access-date=2017-07-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just a few days after China said that it would send a human into orbit in the second half of 2003, Indian Prime Minister [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]] publicly urged his country's scientists to work towards sending a man to the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = India 'on course' for the Moon| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2917271.stm | work=BBC News | date=2003-04-04 | accessdate=2010-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It successfully sent its probe to the Moon in October 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = India and US to explore the Moon| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4753951.stm | work=BBC News | date=2006-05-09 | accessdate=2010-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is planning its second Moon mission, [[Chandrayaan-2]] for 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = What is Chandrayaan-2?| url = http://www.chandrayaan-i.com/chandrayaan2/index2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = ISRO Completes "Scaled-Down" Test For Safe Landing Of Chandrayaan-2| URL = https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/isro-completes-scaled-down-test-for-safe-landing-of-chandrayaan-2-1938288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[ISRO]] launched its [[Mars Orbiter Mission]] on November 5, 2013 (informally called "Mangalyaan") which successfully entered into the orbit around Mars on 24 September 2014. India is the first in Asia and fourth in the world to perform a successful Mars mission. It is also the only one to do so on the first attempt and at a record low cost of $74 million.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.btvin.com/videos/watch/8916/india%E2%80%99s-maiden-mars-mission-makes-history&lt;/ref&gt;

[[ISRO]] has demonstrated its re-entry technology and till date has launched as many as 175 foreign satellites belonging to global customers from 20 countries including US, Germany, France, Japan, Canada, U.K. All of these have been launched successfully by [[PSLV]]s so far, gaining significant expertise in space technologies.

The Japanese space shuttle [[HOPE-X]], to be launched by the conventional space launcher [[H-II]], was developed but the program was postponed and eventually cancelled. Then the simpler manned capsule [[Fuji (Spacecraft)|Fuji]] was proposed but not adopted. Pioneer projects of [[Single stage to orbit|single-stage to orbit]], [[reusable launch vehicle]] horizontal takeoff and landing ASSTS and [[VTOL|vertical takeoff and landing]] [[Kankoh-maru]] were developed but have not been adopted. A more conservative new ([[JAXA|JAXA manned spacecraft]]) project is proposed to launch by 2025 as part of the Japanese plan to send manned missions to the Moon.

Iran has developed its own satellite launch vehicle, named the [[Safir (rocket)|Safir]] SLV, based on the [[Shahab-1|Shahab]] series of [[IRBM]]s. On 2 February 2009, Iranian state television reported that Iran's first domestically made satellite [[Omid]] (from the Persian امید, meaning "Hope") had been successfully launched into [[low Earth orbit]] by a version of Iran's Safir rocket, the Safir-2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSTRE5120NN20090203 | work=Reuters | title=Iran launches satellite; U.S. expresses concern | date=2009-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch coincided with the 30th anniversary of the [[Iranian Revolution]]. Iran is also developing a new launch vehicle [[Simorgh (rocket)]].

===Israel===
{{Main article|Israel Space Agency}}
Israel became the tenth country in the world to build its own satellite and launch it with its own launcher on 19 September 1988. Israel launched its first satellite, [[Ofeq]]-1, using an Israeli-built [[Shavit]] three-stage launch vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aerospaceguide.net/worldspace/israel.html |title=Israel in Space Program |publisher=Aerospaceguide.net |date= |accessdate=2013-10-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528005045/http://www.aerospaceguide.net/worldspace/israel.html |archivedate=2013-05-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The launching was the high point of a process that began in 1983 with the establishment of the [[Israel Space Agency]] under the aegis of the Ministry of Science. Space research by university-based scientists began in the 1960s, providing a ready-made pool of experts for Israel's foray into space. Since then, local universities, research institutes, and private industry, backed by the Israel Space Agency, have made progress in space technology. The agency's role is to support "private and academic space projects, coordinate their efforts, initiate and develop international relations and projects, head integrative projects involving different bodies, and create public awareness for the importance of space development."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/2000_2009/2003/6/Israel-s%20Space%20Program&lt;/ref&gt;

===North Korea===
{{Main article|National Aerospace Development Administration}}

[[DPRK|North Korea]] has many years of experience with rocket technology, which it has passed along to Pakistan and other countries. On December 12, 2012, North Korea placed its first satellite in orbit with the launch of [[Kwangmyŏngsŏng-3 Unit 2]]. On 12 March 2009 North Korea signed the [[Outer Space Treaty]] and the [[Registration Convention]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2009/200903/news12/20090312-11ee.html |title=KCNA Report on DPRK's Accession to International Space Treaty and Convention |publisher=[[Korean Central News Agency|KCNA]] |date=2009-03-12 |accessdate=2009-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402023049/http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2009/200903/news12/20090312-11ee.html |archivedate=2009-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; after a previous declaration of preparations for the launch of [[Kwangmyongsong-2]]. North Korea twice announced satellite launches: [[Kwangmyŏngsŏng-1]] on 31 August 1998 and Kwangmyŏngsŏng-2 on 5 April 2009. Neither of these claims were confirmed by the rest of the world, but the United States and South Korea believe there were tests of military ballistic missiles. The North Korean space agency is the [[Korean Committee of Space Technology]], which operates the [[Musudan-ri]] and [[Tongch'ang-dong Space Launch Center]] rocket launching sites and has developed the [[Paektusan (rocket)|Baekdusan-1]] and [[Unha|Unha (Baekdusan-2)]] space launchers and [[Kwangmyŏngsŏng programme|Kwangmyŏngsŏng]] satellites. In 2009 North Korea announced several future space projects, including manned space flights and the development of a manned partially reusable launch vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.minzuwang.com/inc/news_view.asp?newsid=12503 |title=朝鲜宣布发展太空计划抗衡"西方强权" |publisher=[[Rodong Sinmun]] |date=2009-02-08 |accessdate=February 26, 2009 }}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The successor to the [[Korean Committee of Space Technology]], [[National Aerospace Development Administration]] (NADA) successfully launched an [[Unha-3]] [[launch vehicle]] in February of 2016,  placing the [[Kwangmyŏngsŏng-4]] satellite in orbit.

===Pakistan===
{{Main article|Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission}}

[[Pakistan]] started pursuing space technology on 16 September 1961, when Pakistan's space agency, [[SUPARCO]] was created, with renowned physicist [[Abdus Salam]] as its first administrator. In its early days, SUPARCO researched on the development of solid-fuel [[sounding rockets]] with assistance provided by the United States. On 7 June 1962, with the launch of the ''[[Rehbar-I]]'' (''lit. Teller of the Way'') rocket, Pakistan became the tenth country in the world to successfully conduct the launch of an unmanned spacecraft. This rocket had been developed by a team of scientists and engineers of the [[Pakistan Air Force]], led by [[Air Commodore]] ([[Brigadier-General]]) [[Władysław Józef Marian Turowicz]] in collaboration with [[NASA]] and was launched from [[Sonmiani]], Pakistan's first space launch facility. SUPARCO's unmanned space program continued till 1972, with nearly 20 successful launches. SUPARCO's unmanned space program suffered setbacks during the 1970s and the 1980s, delaying the development and launch of Pakistan's first satellite, [[Badr-I]] till 1990 when it was launched from China. SUPARCO launched Pakistan's second satellite, [[Badr-B]]  in 2001 from [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] using a Ukrainian [[Zenit-2]] rocket, followed by [[Paksat-1R]] in 2011 which was contracted and actually built and launched by China, was Pakistan's first communication satellite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission of Pakistan |url=http://suparco.gov.pk/downloadables/01-STAND-with-SUPARCO.pdf |website=Suparco.gov.pk |accessdate=12 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 July, 2018, [[Pakistan]] launched two satellites from [[China]]'s [[Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre]] with [[Long March 2C|Long March 2C Rocket]]. The [[Pakistan Remote Sensing Satellite|Pakistan Remote Sensing Satellite (PRSS-1)]] was a dual-purpose Earth observational and optical satellite. It was designed and developed by SUPARCO’s engineers. It was {{convert|1200|kg}} weight satellite which will operate at an altitude of {{convert|640|km}}. With the launching of [[Pakistan Remote Sensing Satellite|PRSS-1]] , [[Pakistan]] has become one of the few countries to have its own remote sensing satellite in the orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pakistan Launched  Remote Sensing Satellite-1 (PRSS-1) |url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1418966 |accessdate=6 August 2018 |work=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Express Tribune"&gt;{{cite news |title=Pakistan launches two satellites using Chinese rocket |url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/1753260/1-pakistan-launches-two-satellites-using-chinese-rocket/ |accessdate=6 August 2018 |work=[[The Express Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another flagship satellite, [[Pakistan Technology Evaluation Satellite|Pakistan Technology Evaluation Satellite (PakTES-1A)]] which was also designed and developed by SUPARCO’s engineers, has also co-launched with [[Pakistan Remote Sensing Satellite|PRSS-1]] by the same launch rocket, [[Long March 2C]].

==Solar System exploration==
[[Timeline of Solar System exploration|Solar System exploration]] and manned spaceflights are major space technologies in the public eye. Since [[Sakigake]], the first interplanetary probe in Asia, was launched in 1985, Japan has completed the most planetary exploration, but other nations are catching up.

===Moon race===
The Moon is thought to be rich in [[Helium-3]], which could one day be used in [[Fusion power|nuclear fusion power plants]] to fuel future [[World energy resources and consumption|energy demands]] in Asia. All three main Asian space powers plan to send men to the Moon in the distant future and have already sent [[Robotic spacecraft#Lunar probes|lunar probes]].

====Probing the Moon====
Japan was the first Asian country to launch a lunar probe. The [[Hiten]] (Japanese: "flying angel") spacecraft (known before the launch as MUSES-A), built by the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science of Japan, was launched on 24 January 1990. In many ways, the mission did not go as was planned. [[SELENE|Kaguya]], the second Japanese lunar orbiter spacecraft, was launched on 14 September 2007.

China launched its first lunar probe, [[Chang'e-1]], on 24 October 2007 and successfully entered lunar orbit on 5 November 2007.

India launched its first lunar probe, [[Chandrayaan-1]], on 22 October 2008 and successfully entered its final lunar orbit on 2 November 2008. The mission was considered a major success and the probe detected water on the lunar surface.

====Moon landings====
{{Main article|Moon landing}}
The first confirmed Moon landing from Asia was Hiten's mission in 1993. An intentional hard landing at the end of the mission, some pictures of the lunar surface were taken before impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isas.ac.jp/j/isasnews/backnumber/1994/ISASnews154.pdf|title=ISAS news No.154|language=Japanese|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hiten was not designed as a Moon lander and had few scientific instruments for lunar exploration. The next Japanese Moon landing program was the [[LUNAR-A]], developed from 1992. Although the LUNAR-A orbiter was cancelled, its penetrators are integrated into the Russian [[Luna-Glob]] program, which was scheduled to launch in 2011. The penetrators are "relatively" hard landers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jaxa.jp/projects/sat/lunar_a/index_e.html|title=Lunar exploration satellite "LUNAR-A"}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they are not expected to be destroyed at impact.

The first Asian probe that was part of a lunar landing program was the Indian [[Moon Impact Probe]] (MIP) released from [[Chandrayaan-1]] in 2008. MIP was a hard lander and was designed to move the ground under for research purposes. MIP was designed to be destroyed at impact. Its instruments performed lunar observations to within 25 minutes before impact. The landing test will be applied to future soft landings such as [[Chandrayaan-2]], planned for 2016.

The Chinese Chang'e-1 spacecraft also achieved a systematic hard landing at the end of its mission in 2009, when China became the sixth country to reach the lunar surface. One purpose of the lander was to pre-test for future soft landings. A Chinese lunar soft lander is achieved with the Chang'e-3 mission.

===Exploration of the major planets===
Japanese interplanetary probes have been mostly limited to [[Small Solar System bodies]] such as [[comets]] and [[asteroids]]. JAXA's [[Nozomi (probe)|Nozomi probe]] was launched in 1998, but contact was lost with the probe due to electrical failures before visiting the planet Mars. The second Japanese probe for the planet Venus, [[Akatsuki (probe)|Akatsuki]], was launched in 2010. Akatsuki entered orbit around Venus on December 7, 2015.

Chinese scientists expect that China will take 20&amp;nbsp;years to launch independent planetary probes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zjdaily.zjol.com.cn/html/2009-06/08/content_4869055.htm|script-title=zh:中国自主探测火星还需20年|publisher=浙江日报|language=Chinese|date=2009-06-08|accessdate=2009-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese manned Mars exploration program is planned for around 2050 by the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.recordchina.co.jp/group/g32328.html|script-title=ja:2050年頃に有人火星探査を実施＝中国科学院が計画を発表―中国|publisher=Recoed China|language=Japanese|date=2009-06-10|accessdate=2009-06-12}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

India has successfully launched [[Mars Orbiter Mission]] on November 5, 2013. It reached Mars on September 2014. India has become the only country to successfully insert a satellite into Martian orbit in its maiden attempt; it also became the first Asian country to achieve this feat.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17216">A '''concept inventory''' is a [[criterion-referenced test]] designed to help determine whether a student has an accurate working [[knowledge]] of a specific set of concepts. Historically, concept inventories have been in the form of [[multiple-choice test]]s in order to aid interpretability and facilitate administration in large classes.  Unlike a typical, teacher-authored multiple-choice test, questions and response choices on concept inventories are the subject of extensive research. The aims of the research include ascertaining (a) the range of what individuals think a particular question is asking and (b) the most common responses to the questions. Concept inventories are evaluated to ensure test [[reliability (statistics)|reliability]] and [[validity (statistics)|validity]]. In its final form, each question includes one correct answer and several distractors.

Ideally, a score on a criterion-referenced test reflects the amount of content knowledge a student has mastered. Criterion-referenced tests differ from [[norm-referenced tests]] in that (in theory) the former is not used to compare an individual's score to the scores of the group. Ordinarily, the purpose of a criterion-referenced test is to ascertain whether a student mastered a predetermined amount of content knowledge; upon obtaining a test score that is at or above a [[cutscore|cutoff score]], the student can move on to study a body of content knowledge that follows next in a learning sequence. In general, item difficulty values ranging between 30% and 70% are best able to provide information about student understanding.

The distractors are incorrect or irrelevant answers that are usually (but not always) based on students' commonly held misconceptions.&lt;ref&gt;"Development and Validation of Instruments to Measure Learning of Expert-Like Thinking." W. K. Adams &amp; C. E. Wieman, 2010. International Journal of Science Education, 1-24. iFirst, {{doi|10.1080/09500693.2010.512369}}&lt;/ref&gt; Test developers often research student misconceptions by examining students' responses to open-ended essay questions and conducting "think-aloud" interviews with students. The distractors chosen by students help researchers understand student thinking and give instructors insights into students' prior knowledge (and, sometimes, firmly held beliefs).  This foundation in research underlies instrument construction and design, and plays a role in helping educators obtain clues about students' ideas, [[scientific misconceptions]], and [[didaskalogenic]] ("teacher-induced" or "teaching-induced") confusions and conceptual lacunae that interfere with learning.

==Concept inventories in use==
Concept inventories are education-related diagnostic tests.&lt;ref name="Tregust, 1988"&gt;Tregust, D.F. 1988. Development and use of diagnostic tests to evaluate students' misconceptions in science.  International Journal of Science Education 10: 159-169 [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0950069880100204#.VKMeQsZl5FI]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1985 Halloun and Hestenes introduced a "multiple-choice mechanics diagnostic test" to examine students' concepts about motion.&lt;ref name="Halloun and Hestenes"&gt;Hallouin, I. A., &amp; Hestenes, D. Common sense concepts about motion (1985). American Journal of Physics, 53, 1043-1055&lt;/ref&gt;  It evaluates student understanding of basic concepts in classical (macroscopic) mechanics. A little later, the [[Force Concept Inventory]] (FCI), another concept inventory, was developed.&lt;ref name="Halloun and Hestenes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hestenes D, Wells M, Swackhamer G 1992 Force concept inventory. The Physics Teacher 30: 141-166.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://scitation.aip.org/vsearch/servlet/VerityServlet?KEY=AJPIAS&amp;CURRENT=NO&amp;ONLINE=YES&amp;smode=strresults&amp;sort=rel&amp;maxdisp=25&amp;threshold=0&amp;pjournals=AJPIAS&amp;pyears=2001%2C2000%2C1999&amp;possible1=465&amp;possible1zone=fpage&amp;fromvolume=66&amp;SMODE=strsearch&amp;OUTLOG=NO&amp;viewabs=AJPIAS&amp;key=DISPLAY&amp;docID=1&amp;page=1&amp;chapter=0 Hestenes D 1998. Am. J. Phys. 66:465]&lt;/ref&gt; The FCI was designed to assess student understanding of the [[Classical mechanics|Newtonian]] concepts of force.  Hestenes (1998) found that while "nearly 80% of the [students completing introductory college physics courses] could state [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's Third Law]] at the beginning of the course. FCI data showed that less than 15% of them fully understood it at the end".These results have been replicated in a number of studies involving students at a range of institutions (see sources section below).

In many areas, foundational scientific concepts transcend disciplinary boundaries. An example of an inventory that assesses knowledge of such concepts is an instrument developed by  Odom and Barrow (1995) to evaluate understanding of [[diffusion]] and [[osmosis]].&lt;ref name="Odom"&gt;Odom AL, Barrow LH 1995 Development and application of a two-tier diagnostic test measuring college biology students' understanding of diffusion and osmosis after a course of instruction.

(1998)&lt;ref name="Wright"&gt;[http://bioliteracy.colorado.edu/Readings/Wright.pdf Wright et al., 1998. J. Chem. Educ. 75: 986-992]&lt;/ref&gt; and the essay and oral exams used by Nehm and Schonfeld (2008).&lt;ref name="Nehm &amp; Schonfeld 2008"/&gt; and Cooper et al &lt;ref&gt;Cooper, M. M.; Underwood, S.

==Caveats associated with concept inventory use==
Some concept inventories are problematic.  The concepts tested may not be fundamental or important in a particular discipline, the concepts involved may not be explicitly taught in a class or curriculum, or answering a question correctly may require only a superficial understanding of a topic.  It is therefore possible to either over-estimate or under-estimate student content mastery.  While concept inventories designed to identify trends in student thinking may not be useful in monitoring learning gains as a result of pedagogical interventions, disciplinary mastery may not be the variable measured by a particular instrument.  Users should be careful to ensure that concept inventories are actually testing conceptual understanding, rather than test-taking ability, language skills, or other abilities that can influence test performance.

The use of multiple-choice exams as concept inventories is not without controversy.   The very structure of multiple-choice type concept inventories raises questions involving the extent to which complex, and often nuanced situations and ideas must be simplified or clarified to produce unambiguous responses.  For example, a multiple-choice exam designed to assess knowledge of key concepts in natural selection&lt;ref name="AFN"/&gt; does not meet a number of standards of quality control.&lt;ref name="Nehm &amp; Schonfeld 2010"/&gt; One problem with the exam is that the two members of each of several pairs of parallel items, with each pair designed to measure exactly one key concept in natural selection, sometimes have very different levels of difficulty.&lt;ref name="Nehm &amp; Schonfeld 2008"/&gt; Another problem is that the multiple-choice exam overestimates knowledge of natural selection as reflected in student performance on a diagnostic essay exam and a diagnostic oral exam, two instruments with reasonably good [[construct validity]].&lt;ref name="Nehm &amp; Schonfeld 2008"/&gt;   Although scoring concept inventories in the form of essay or oral exams is labor-intensive, costly, and difficult to implement with large numbers of students, such exams can offer a more realistic appraisal of the actual levels of students' conceptual mastery as well as their misconceptions.&lt;ref name="Wright"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nehm &amp; Schonfeld 2008"/&gt; Recently, however, computer technology has been developed that can [[Automated essay scoring|score essay responses]] on concept inventories in biology and other domains (Nehm, Ha, &amp; Mayfield, 2011),&lt;ref&gt;Nehm, R.H., Ha, M., Mayfield, E.

[http://www.springerlink.com/content/1059-0145/preprint/?sort=p_OnlineDate&amp;sortorder=desc&amp;o=30]&lt;/ref&gt; promising to facilitate the scoring of concept inventories organized as (transcribed) oral exams as well as essays.

'''Creativity''' is a phenomenon whereby something new and somehow valuable is formed. The created item may be intangible (such as an [[idea]], a [[scientific theory]], a [[musical composition]], or a [[joke]]) or a physical object (such as an [[invention]], a [[Literature|literary work]], or a [[painting]]).

Scholarly interest in creativity is found in a number of disciplines, primarily [[psychology]], [[business studies]], and [[cognitive science]], but also [[education]], [[technology]], [[engineering]], [[philosophy]] (particularly [[philosophy of science]]), [[theology]], [[sociology]], [[linguistics]],  and [[economics]], covering  the relations between creativity and general [[intelligence]], personality type, mental and neurological processes, mental health, or [[artificial intelligence]]; the potential for fostering creativity through education and training; the fostering of creativity for national economic benefit, and the application of creative resources to improve the effectiveness of teaching and learning.

== Etymology ==
The [[lexeme]] in the English word ''creativity'' comes from the [[Latin]] term ''creō'' "to create, make": its [[Morphological derivation|derivational suffixes]] also come from Latin. The word "create" appeared in English as early as the 14th century, notably in Chaucer, to indicate divine creation&lt;ref name="RuncoAlbert"&gt;{{cite book|last=Runco|first=Mark A.|title=The Cambridge Handbook of Creativity|year=2010|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-73025-9|author2=Albert, Robert S.|editor=[[James C. Kaufman]] |editor2=Robert J. Sternberg|chapter=Creativity Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in [[The Parson's Tale]]&lt;ref&gt;"And eke Job saith, that in hell is no order of rule. And albeit that God hath '''created''' all things in right order, and nothing without order, but all things be ordered and numbered, yet nevertheless they that be damned be not in order, nor hold no order."&lt;/ref&gt;). However, its modern meaning as an act of human creation did not emerge until after [[Age of Enlightenment|the Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name=RuncoAlbert /&gt;

== Definition ==
In a summary of scientific research into creativity, Michael Mumford suggested: "Over the course of the last decade, however, we seem to have reached a general agreement that creativity involves the production of novel, useful products" (Mumford, 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;110),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mumford | first1 = M. D. | year = 2003 | title = Where have we been, where are we going? Taking stock in creativity research | url = | journal = [[Creativity Research Journal]] | volume = 15 | issue = 2–3| pages = 107–120 | doi=10.1080/10400419.2003.9651403}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, in [[Robert Sternberg]]'s words, the production of "something original and worthwhile".&lt;ref name="Sternberg Cognitive Psychology 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sternberg|first1=Robert J.|title=Cognitive Psychology|date=2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-133-38701-5|page=479|edition=6|chapter=Creativity}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authors have diverged dramatically in their precise definitions beyond these general commonalities: Peter Meusburger reckons that over a hundred different analyses can be found in the literature.&lt;ref name="Meusburger1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Meusburger|first=Peter|title=Milieus of Creativity: An Interdisciplinary Approach to Spatiality of Creativity|year=2009|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-9876-5 |editor=Meusburger, P. |editor2=Funke, J. |editor3=Wunder, E.|chapter=Milieus of Creativity: The Role of Places, Environments and Spatial Contexts}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an illustration, one definition given by [[Ellis Paul Torrance|Dr. E. Paul Torrance]] described it as "a process of becoming sensitive to problems, deficiencies, gaps in knowledge, missing elements, disharmonies, and so on; identifying the difficulty; searching for solutions, making guesses, or formulating hypotheses about the deficiencies: testing and retesting these hypotheses and possibly modifying and retesting them; and finally communicating the results."&lt;ref name="Torrance Test Manual Verbal"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Torrance|first1=Paul|title=The Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking-Norms-Technical Manual Research Edition|publisher=Personnel Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|page=6|chapter=Verbal Tests. Forms A and B-Figural Tests, Forms A and B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aspects ==
Theories of creativity (particularly investigation of why some people are more creative than others) have focused on a variety of aspects. The dominant factors are usually identified as "the four Ps" — process, product, person, and place (according to [[James Melvin Rhodes|Mel Rhodes]]).&lt;ref&gt;Mel Rhodes: [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/20342603?uid=3737864&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21103750220081''An Analysis of Creativity.''] in Phi Delta Kappan 1961, Vol. 42,  No. 7, p. 306–307&lt;/ref&gt; A focus on ''process'' is shown in cognitive approaches that try to describe thought mechanisms and techniques for creative thinking. Theories invoking divergent rather than convergent thinking (such as [[J. P. Guilford|Guilford]]), or those describing the staging of the creative process (such as [[Graham Wallas|Wallas]]) are primarily theories of creative process. A focus on creative ''product'' usually appears in attempts to measure creativity (psychometrics, see below) and in creative ideas framed as successful [[memetics|memes]].&lt;ref name="Gabora"&gt;{{cite journal|last=[[Liane Gabora|Gabora, Liane]]|year=1997|title= The Origin and Evolution of Culture and Creativity|journal=Journal of Memetics – Evolutionary Models of Information Transmission|volume=1|url=http://cogprints.org/794/1/oecc.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychometric approach to creativity reveals that it also involves the ability to produce more.&lt;ref name="Sternberg 2009 468"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sternberg|first=Robert J.|title=Cognitive Psychology|year=2009|publisher=CENGAGE Learning|isbn=978-0-495-50629-4|page=468|editor=Jaime A. Perkins |editor2=Dan Moneypenny |editor3=Wilson Co}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A focus on the nature of the creative ''person'' considers more general intellectual habits, such as openness, levels of [[Ideation (creative process)|ideation]], autonomy, expertise, exploratory behavior, and so on. A focus on ''place'' considers the circumstances in which creativity flourishes, such as degrees of autonomy, access to resources, and the nature of gatekeepers. Creative lifestyles are characterized by nonconforming attitudes and behaviors as well as flexibility.&lt;ref name="Sternberg 2009 468" /&gt;

== History of the concept ==
{{Main|History of the concept of creativity}}
[[File:Plato-raphael.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Greek philosophers like Plato rejected the concept of creativity, preferring to see art as a form of discovery. Asked in ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', "Will we say, of a painter, that he makes something?", Plato answers, "Certainly not, he merely [[mimesis|imitates]]."&lt;ref name="Six Ideas p. 244"&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], ''A History of Six Ideas: an Essay in Aesthetics'', p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

=== Ancient views ===
Most ancient cultures, including thinkers of [[Ancient Greece]],&lt;ref name="Six Ideas p. 244" /&gt; [[History of China#Ancient China|Ancient China]], and [[Outline of ancient India|Ancient India]],&lt;ref name="Albert99"&gt;{{cite book|last=Albert|first= R. S.|author2=Runco, M. A.|year=1999|editor = Sternberg, R. J.|title= Handbook of Creativity|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]|chapter=:A History of Research on Creativity}}&lt;/ref&gt; lacked the concept of creativity, seeing art as a form of discovery and not creation. The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] had no terms corresponding to "to create" or "creator" except for the expression "''poiein''" ("to make"), which only applied to ''poiesis'' (poetry) and to the ''poietes'' (poet, or "maker") who made it. [[Plato]] did not believe in art as a form of creation. Asked in ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Plato, The Republic, Book X – [[wikisource:The Republic/Book X]]&lt;/ref&gt; "Will we say, of a painter, that he makes something?", he answers, "Certainly not, he merely [[mimesis|imitates]]."&lt;ref name="Six Ideas p. 244" /&gt;

It is commonly argued that the notion of "creativity" originated in [[Western culture]] through [[Christianity]], as a matter of [[Revelation|divine inspiration]].&lt;ref name="RuncoAlbert" /&gt; According to the historian [[Daniel J. Boorstin]], "the early Western conception of creativity was the [[Genesis creation narrative|Biblical story of creation]] given in the ''[[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]''."&lt;ref name="Albert2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Albert|first= R. S.|author2=Runco, M. A.|year=1999|editor = Sternberg, R. J.|title= Handbook of Creativity|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]|chapter=:A History of Research on Creativity|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is not creativity in the modern sense, which did not arise until the [[Renaissance]]. In the Judaeo-Christian tradition, creativity was the sole province of God; humans were not considered to have the ability to create something new except as an expression of God's work.&lt;ref name="NiuSternberg"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/h0091265|last=Niu|first=Weihua|author2=Sternberg, Robert J.|title=The Philosophical Roots of Western and Eastern Conceptions of Creativity|journal=Journal of Theoretical and Philosophical Psychology|year=2006|volume=26|pages=18–38|url=http://www.westga.edu/~stpp/JTPP_Aticles/26-2/THE1210.pdf|accessdate=23 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/641OBVx0d?url=http://www.westga.edu/~stpp/JTPP_Aticles/26-2/THE1210.pdf|archivedate=18 December 2011|df=}}; cf.

Runco |editor2=Steven R. Pritzer|chapter=Concepts of Creativity: A history|publisher=[[Elsevier]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Romans and Greeks invoked the concept of an external creative "[[daemon (classical mythology)|daemon]]" (Greek) or "[[Genius (mythology)|genius]]" (Latin), linked to the sacred or the divine. However, none of these views are similar to the modern concept of creativity, and the individual was not seen as the cause of creation until the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref name="Albert3"&gt;{{cite book|last=Albert|first= R. S.|author2=Runco, M. A.|year=1999|editor = Sternberg, R. J.|title= Handbook of Creativity|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]|chapter=:A History of Research on Creativity|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during the Renaissance that creativity was first seen, not as a conduit for the divine, but from the abilities of "[[Great Man theory|great men]]".&lt;ref name="Albert3" /&gt;

=== The Enlightenment and after ===
The rejection of creativity in favor of discovery and the belief that individual creation was a conduit of the divine would dominate the West probably until the [[Renaissance]] and even later.&lt;ref name="NiuSternberg" /&gt; The development of the modern concept of creativity begins in the [[Renaissance]], when creation began to be perceived as having originated from the abilities of the individual, and not God. This could be attributed to the leading intellectual movement of the time, aptly named [[humanism]], which developed an intensely human-centric outlook on the world, valuing the intellect and achievement of the individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Humanism - Rome Reborn: The Vatican Library &amp; Renaissance Culture {{!}} Exhibitions - Library of Congress|url = https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/vatican/humanism.html|website = www.loc.gov|date = 1993-01-08|accessdate = 2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this philosophy arose the [[Renaissance man]] (or polymath), an individual who embodies the principals of humanism in their ceaseless courtship with knowledge and creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Leonardo da Vinci {{!}} Italian artist, engineer, and scientist|url = http://www.britannica.com/biography/Leonardo-da-Vinci|website = Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate = 2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most well-known and immensely accomplished examples is [[Leonardo da Vinci]].

However, this shift was gradual and would not become immediately apparent until the Enlightenment.&lt;ref name="Albert3" /&gt; By the 18th century and the [[Age of Enlightenment]], mention of creativity (notably in [[aesthetics]]), linked with the concept of [[imagination]], became more frequent.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz80"&gt;{{cite book |author=Tatarkiewicz, Władysław |authorlink=Władysław Tatarkiewicz |title=A History of Six Ideas: an Essay in Aesthetics |location=Translated from the Polish by [[Christopher Kasparek]], The Hague |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff |year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the writing of [[Thomas Hobbes]], imagination became a key element of human cognition;&lt;ref name="RuncoAlbert" /&gt; [[William Duff (writer)|William Duff]] was one of the first to identify imagination as a quality of [[genius]], typifying the separation being made between talent (productive, but breaking no new ground) and genius.&lt;ref name="Dacey" /&gt;

As a direct and independent topic of study, creativity effectively received no attention until the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Dacey" /&gt; Runco and Albert argue that creativity as the subject of proper study began seriously to emerge in the late 19th century with the increased interest in individual differences inspired by the arrival of [[Darwinism]]. In particular, they refer to the work of [[Francis Galton]], who through his [[Eugenics|eugenicist]] outlook took a keen interest in the heritability of intelligence, with creativity taken as an aspect of genius.&lt;ref name="RuncoAlbert" /&gt;

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, leading mathematicians and scientists such as [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] (1896) and [[Henri Poincaré]] (1908) began to reflect on and publicly discuss their creative processes.

=== Twentieth century to the present day ===
The insights of Poincaré and von Helmholtz were built on in early accounts of the creative process by pioneering theorists such as [[Graham Wallas]]&lt;ref name="Wallas26"&gt;{{cite book |author=Wallas, G. |title=Art of Thought |year=1926 |authorlink=Graham Wallas}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Max Wertheimer]]. In his work ''Art of Thought'', published in 1926, Wallas presented one of the first models of the creative process. In the Wallas stage model, creative insights and illuminations may be explained by a process consisting of 5 stages:
:(i) ''preparation'' (preparatory work on a problem that focuses the individual's mind on the problem and explores the problem's dimensions),
:(ii) ''incubation'' (where the problem is internalized into the unconscious mind and nothing appears externally to be happening),
:(iii) ''intimation'' (the creative person gets a "feeling" that a solution is on its way),
:(iv) ''illumination'' or insight (where the creative idea bursts forth from its [[preconscious]] processing into conscious awareness);
:(v) ''verification'' (where the idea is consciously verified, elaborated, and then applied).
Wallas' model is often treated as four stages, with "intimation" seen as a sub-stage.

Wallas considered creativity to be a legacy of the [[evolution]]ary process, which allowed humans to quickly adapt to rapidly changing environments. Simonton&lt;ref name="Simonton99"&gt;{{cite book |author=Simonton, D. K. |year=1999 |title=Origins of genius: Darwinian perspectives on creativity |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides an updated perspective on this view in his book, ''Origins of genius: Darwinian perspectives on creativity''.

In 1927, [[Alfred North Whitehead]] gave the Gifford Lectures at the University of Edinburgh, later published as ''[[Process and Reality]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Whitehead|first=Alfred North|title=Process and reality : an essay in cosmology ; Gifford Lectures delivered in the University of Edinburgh during the session 1927–28|year=1978|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-02-934580-1|edition=Corrected}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is credited with having coined the term "creativity" to serve as the ultimate category of his metaphysical scheme: "Whitehead actually coined the term – our term, still the preferred currency of exchange among literature, science, and the arts. . . a term that quickly became so popular, so omnipresent, that its invention within living memory, and by Alfred North Whitehead of all people, quickly became occluded".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Steven|title=Introduction: Whitehead Now|journal=Configurations|year=2005|volume=1|issue=13|pages=1–33}}. Cf. [[Michel Weber]] and Will Desmond (eds.). ''[https://www.academia.edu/279955/Handbook_of_Whiteheadian_Process_Thought Handbook of Whiteheadian Process Thought]'' (Frankfurt / Lancaster, Ontos Verlag, Process Thought X1 &amp; X2, 2008) and Ronny Desmet &amp; Michel Weber (edited by), ''[https://www.academia.edu/279940/Whitehead._The_Algebra_of_Metaphysics Whitehead. The Algebra of Metaphysics. Applied Process Metaphysics Summer Institute Memorandum]'', Louvain-la-Neuve, Les Éditions Chromatika, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The formal [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] measurement of creativity, from the standpoint of orthodox [[Psychology|psychological]] literature, is usually considered to have begun with [[J. P. Guilford]]'s 1950 address to the [[American Psychological Association]], which helped popularize the topic&lt;ref name="Sternberg99"&gt;{{cite book |author=Sternberg, R. J. |author2=Lubart, T. I. |chapter=The Concept of Creativity: Prospects and Paradigms |editor=Sternberg, R. J. |title=Handbook of Creativity |year=1999 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |authorlink=Robert Sternberg |isbn=978-0-521-57285-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and focus attention on a scientific approach to conceptualizing creativity. (It should be noted that the London School of Psychology had instigated psychometric studies of creativity as early as 1927 with the work of H. L. Hargreaves into the Faculty of Imagination,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hargreaves | first1 = H. L. | year = 1927 | title = The faculty of imagination: An enquiry concerning the existence of a general faculty, or group factor, of imagination | url = | journal = British Journal of Psychology | volume = Monograph Supplement 3 | issue = | pages = 1–74 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it did not have the same impact.) Statistical analysis led to the recognition of creativity (as measured) as a separate aspect of human cognition to [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]]-type intelligence, into which it had previously been subsumed. Guilford's work suggested that above a threshold level of IQ, the relationship between creativity and classically measured intelligence broke down.&lt;ref name="Kozbelt"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kozbelt|first=Aaron|title=The Cambridge Handbook of Creativity|year=2010|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-73025-9 |author2=Beghetto, Ronald A. |author3=Runco, Mark A.|editor=[[James C. Kaufman]] |editor2=Robert J. Sternberg|chapter=Theories of Creativity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Four C" model ===
[[James C. Kaufman]] and Beghetto introduced a "four C" model of creativity; ''mini-c'' ("transformative learning" involving "personally meaningful interpretations of experiences, actions, and insights"), ''little-c'' (everyday problem solving and creative expression), ''Pro-C'' (exhibited by people who are professionally or vocationally creative though not necessarily eminent) and ''Big-C'' (creativity considered great in the given field). This model was intended to help accommodate models and theories of creativity that stressed competence as an essential component and the historical transformation of a creative domain as the highest mark of creativity. It also, the authors argued, made a useful framework for analyzing creative processes in individuals.&lt;ref name="KaufBeg2009"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/a0013688|last=Kaufman|first=James C.|author2=Beghetto, Ronald A.|title=Beyond Big and Little: The Four C Model of Creativity|journal=[[Review of General Psychology]]|year=2009|volume=13|issue=1|pages=1–12|authorlink=James C. Kaufman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contrast of terms "Big C" and "Little c" has been widely used. Kozbelt, Beghetto and Runco use a little-c/Big-C model to review major theories of creativity.&lt;ref name=Kozbelt /&gt; [[Margaret Boden]] distinguishes between h-creativity (historical) and p-creativity (personal).&lt;ref name="Boden2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boden|first=Margaret|title=The Creative Mind: Myths And Mechanisms|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-297-82069-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robinson&lt;ref name="allourfutures"&gt;{{cite book|last=Robinson|first=Ken|title=All our futures: Creativity, culture, education|year=1998|publisher=National Advisory Committee on Creative and Cultural Education|url=http://sirkenrobinson.com/skr/pdf/allourfutures.pdf|accessdate=2 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016051449/http://sirkenrobinson.com/skr/pdf/allourfutures.pdf|archivedate=16 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Anna Craft&lt;ref name="Craft1" /&gt; have focused on creativity in a general population, particularly with respect to education. Craft makes a similar distinction between "high" and "little c" creativity.&lt;ref name="Craft1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Craft|first=Anna|title=Creativity in education|year=2001|publisher=Continuum International|isbn=978-0-8264-4863-7 |editor=Craft, A. |editor2=Jeffrey, B. |editor3=Leibling, M. |chapter='Little C' creativity}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cites [[Ken Robinson (educationalist)|Ken Robinson]] as referring to "high" and "democratic" creativity. [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi]]&lt;ref name="Csik1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Csíkszentmihályi |first=Mihály|title=Creativity:Flow and the Psychology of Discovery and Invention|year=1996|publisher=Harper Collins|isbn=978-0-06-092820-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; has defined creativity in terms of those individuals judged to have made significant creative, perhaps domain-changing contributions. Simonton has analysed the career trajectories of eminent creative people in order to map patterns and predictors of creative productivity.&lt;ref name="Simonton97"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.104.1.66|last=Simonton|first=D. K.|title=Creative Productivity: A Predictive and Explanatory Model of Career Trajectories and Landmarks|journal=Psychological Review|year=1997|volume=104|issue=1|pages=66–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theories of creative processes ==
There has been much empirical study in [[psychology]] and [[cognitive science]] of the processes through which creativity occurs. Interpretation of the results of these studies has led to several possible explanations of the sources and methods of creativity.

=== Incubation ===
Incubation is a temporary break from [[creative problem solving]] that can result in insight.&lt;ref name="EoC Incubation"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=S. M.|title=Encyclopedia of Creativity Volume I|year=2011|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-375039-6|pages=653–657|edition=2nd|editor=M. A. Runco |editor2=S. R. Pritzker|chapter=Incubation}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been some empirical research looking at whether, as the concept of "incubation" in [[Graham Wallas|Wallas]]' model implies, a period of interruption or rest from a problem may aid creative problem-solving. Ward&lt;ref name="Ward2003"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ward, T. |year=2003 |chapter=Creativity |editor= Nagel, L. |title=Encyclopaedia of Cognition |location=New York |publisher=Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt; lists various hypotheses that have been advanced to explain why incubation may aid creative problem-solving, and notes how some [[empirical evidence]] is consistent with the hypothesis that incubation aids creative problem-solving in that it enables "forgetting" of misleading clues. Absence of incubation may lead the problem solver to become [[fixation (psychology)|fixated]] on inappropriate strategies of solving the problem.&lt;ref name="Smith1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Steven M.|title=The Creative Cognition Approach|year=1995|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|editor=Steven M. Smith |editor2=Thomas B. Ward |editor3=Ronald A. Finke|chapter=Fixation, Incubation, and Insight in Memory and Creative Thinking}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work disputes the earlier hypothesis that creative solutions to problems arise mysteriously from the unconscious mind while the conscious mind is occupied on other tasks.&lt;ref name=Anderson2000&gt;"{{cite book |author=Anderson, J. R. |year=2000 |title=Cognitive psychology and its implications |publisher=Worth Publishers |isbn=978-0-7167-1686-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
This earlier hypothesis is discussed in [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi|Csikszentmihalyi]]'s five phase model of the creative process which describes incubation as a time that your unconscious takes over. This allows for unique connections to be made without your consciousness trying to make logical order out of the problem.&lt;ref&gt;Csikszentmihalyi, Mihaly (1996). ''Creativity : Flow and the Psychology of Discovery and Invention.'' New York: Harper Perennial. {{ISBN|0-06-092820-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Convergent and divergent thinking ===
[[J. P. Guilford]]&lt;ref name="Guilford67"&gt;{{cite book |author=Guilford, J. P. |year=1967 |title=The Nature of Human Intelligence |authorlink=J. P. Guilford}}&lt;/ref&gt; drew a distinction between convergent and divergent production (commonly renamed [[convergent thinking|convergent]] and [[divergent thinking]]). Convergent thinking involves aiming for a single, correct solution to a problem, whereas divergent thinking involves creative generation of multiple answers to a set problem. Divergent thinking is sometimes used as a synonym for creativity in psychology literature. Other researchers have occasionally used the terms ''flexible'' thinking or [[fluid and crystallized intelligence|fluid intelligence]], which are roughly similar to (but not synonymous with) creativity.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

=== Creative cognition approach ===
In 1992, Finke et al. proposed the "Geneplore" model, in which creativity takes place in two phases: a generative phase, where an individual constructs mental representations called preinventive structures, and an exploratory phase where those structures are used to come up with creative ideas. Some evidence shows that when people use their imagination to develop new ideas, those ideas are heavily structured in predictable ways by the properties of existing categories and concepts.&lt;ref name="Ward1995"&gt;Ward, T.B. (1995). What’s old about new ideas. In S. M. Smith, T. B. Ward &amp; R. A. &amp; Finke (Eds.) ''The creative cognition approach'', 157–178, London: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Weisberg&lt;ref name="Weisberg93"&gt;{{cite book |author=Weisberg, R. W. |year=1993 |title=Creativity: Beyond the myth of genius |publisher=Freeman |isbn=978-0-7167-2119-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued, by contrast, that creativity only involves ordinary cognitive processes yielding extraordinary results.

=== The Explicit–Implicit Interaction (EII) theory ===
Helie and Sun&lt;ref name="HelieSun2010"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Helie S. |author2=Sun R. | year = 2010 | title = Incubation, insight, and creative problem solving: A unified theory and a connectionist model | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 117 | issue = 3| pages = 994–1024 | doi=10.1037/a0019532 | pmid=20658861|citeseerx=10.1.1.405.2245 }}&lt;/ref&gt; recently proposed a unified framework for understanding [[creative problem-solving|creativity in problem solving]], namely the Explicit–Implicit Interaction (EII) theory of creativity. This new theory constitutes an attempt at providing a more unified explanation of relevant phenomena (in part by reinterpreting/integrating various fragmentary existing theories of [[Incubation (psychology)|incubation]] and [[insight]]).

The EII theory relies mainly on five basic principles, namely:
# The co-existence of and the difference between explicit and implicit knowledge; 
# The simultaneous involvement of implicit and explicit processes in most tasks; 
# The redundant representation of explicit and implicit knowledge; 
# The integration of the results of explicit and implicit processing;
# The iterative (and possibly bidirectional) processing. 
A computational implementation of the theory was developed based on the [[CLARION (cognitive architecture)|CLARION cognitive architecture]] and used to simulate relevant human data. This work represents an initial step in the development of process-based theories of creativity encompassing incubation, insight, and various other related phenomena.

=== Conceptual blending ===
{{Main|Conceptual blending}}
In ''[[The Act of Creation]]'', [[Arthur Koestler]] introduced the concept of ''bisociation'' — that creativity arises as a result of the intersection of two quite different frames of reference.&lt;ref name="Koestler64"&gt;{{cite book |author=Koestler, A. |title=The Act of Creation |year=1964 |authorlink=Arthur Koestler |isbn=978-0-330-73116-4 |publisher=Pan Books |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea was later developed into conceptual blending. In the 1990s, various approaches in cognitive science that dealt with [[metaphor]], [[analogy]], and [[structure mapping]] have been converging, and a new integrative approach to the study of creativity in science, art and humor has emerged under the label [[conceptual blending]].

=== Honing theory ===
Honing theory, developed principally by psychologist [[Liane Gabora]], posits that creativity arises due to the self-organizing, self-mending nature of a worldview. The creative process is a way in which the individual hones (and re-hones) an integrated worldview. Honing theory places emphasis not only on the externally visible creative outcome but also the internal cognitive restructuring and repair of the worldview brought about by the creative process. When faced with a creatively demanding task, there is an interaction between the conception of the task and the worldview. The conception of the task changes through interaction with the worldview, and the worldview changes through interaction with the task. This interaction is reiterated until the task is complete, at which point not only is the task conceived of differently, but the worldview is subtly or drastically transformed as it follows the natural tendency of a worldview to attempt to resolve dissonance and seek internal consistency amongst its components, whether they be ideas, attitudes, or bits of knowledge.

A central feature of honing theory is the notion of a potentiality state.&lt;ref&gt;Gabora, L. &amp; Saab, A. (2011). Creative interference and states of potentiality in analogy problem solving. ''Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society''. July 20–23, 2011, Boston MA.&lt;/ref&gt; Honing theory posits that creative thought proceeds not by searching through and randomly ‘mutating’ predefined possibilities, but by drawing upon associations that exist due to overlap in the distributed neural cell assemblies that participate in the encoding of experiences in memory. Midway through the creative process one may have made associations between the current task and previous experiences, but not yet disambiguated which aspects of those previous experiences are relevant to the current task. Thus the creative idea may feel ‘half-baked’. It is at that point that it can be said to be in a potentiality state, because how it will actualize depends on the different internally or externally generated contexts it interacts with.

Honing theory is held to explain certain phenomena not dealt with by other theories of creativity, for example, how different works by the same creator are observed in studies to exhibit a recognizable style or 'voice' even through in different creative outlets. This is not predicted by theories of creativity that emphasize chance processes or the accumulation of expertise, but it is predicted by honing theory, according to which personal style reflects the creator's uniquely structured worldview. Another example is in the environmental stimulus for creativity. Creativity is commonly considered to be fostered by a supportive, nurturing, trustworthy environment conducive to self-actualization. However, research shows that creativity is also associated with childhood adversity, which would stimulate honing.

=== Everyday imaginative thought ===
In everyday thought, people often spontaneously imagine alternatives to reality when they think "if only...".&lt;ref&gt;Roese, N. J. &amp; Olson, J. M. (1995). ''What Might Have Been: The Social Psychology of Counterfactual Thinking''. Mahwah, New Jersey: Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt; Their [[counterfactual thinking]] is viewed as an example of everyday creative processes.&lt;ref&gt;Markman, K. Klein, W. &amp; Suhr, E. (eds) (2009). ''Handbook of mental simulation and the human imagination.'' Hove, Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proposed that the creation of counterfactual alternatives to reality depends on similar cognitive processes to rational thought.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ruth M. J. Byrne|Byrne, R. M. J.]] (2005). The Rational Imagination: How People Create Counterfactual Alternatives to Reality. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assessing individual creative ability ==
=== Creativity quotient ===
There was a ''creativity quotient'' developed similar to the [[intelligence quotient]] (IQ). It makes use of the results of divergent thinking tests (see below) by processing them further. It gives more weight to ideas that are radically different from other ideas in the response.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Snyder|first=Allan|date=2004|title=The creativity quotient: An objective scoring of ideational fluency|journal=Creativity Research Journal|volume=16|issue=4|pages=415–419|doi=10.1080/10400410409534552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychometric approach ===
[[J. P. Guilford]]'s group,&lt;ref name="Guilford67" /&gt; which pioneered the modern [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] study of creativity, constructed several tests to measure creativity in 1967:
* Plot Titles, where participants are given the plot of a story and asked to write original titles.
* Quick Responses is a word-association test scored for uncommonness.
* Figure Concepts, where participants were given simple drawings of objects and individuals and asked to find qualities or features that are common by two or more drawings; these were scored for uncommonness.
* Unusual Uses is finding unusual uses for common everyday objects such as bricks.
* Remote Associations, where participants are asked to find a word between two given words (e.g. Hand _____ Call)
* Remote Consequences, where participants are asked to generate a list of consequences of unexpected events (e.g. loss of gravity)

Building on Guilford's work, [[Ellis Paul Torrance|Torrance]]&lt;ref&gt;(Torrance, 1974)&lt;/ref&gt; developed the [[Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://people.uncw.edu/caropresoe/GiftedFoundations/SocialEmotional/Creativity-articles/Kim_Can-we-trust-creativity-tests.pdf|title=Can We Trust Creativity Tests?|author=Kim, Kyung Hee|year=2006|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|volume=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; They involved simple tests of divergent thinking and other problem-solving skills, which were scored on:
* '''Fluency''' – The total number of interpretable, meaningful, and relevant ideas generated in response to the stimulus.
* '''Originality''' – The statistical rarity of the responses among the test subjects.
* '''Elaboration''' – The amount of detail in the responses.

Such tests, sometimes called ''Divergent Thinking (DT)'' tests have been both supported&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kim | first1 = K.

Considerable progress has been made in automated scoring of [[divergent thinking]] tests using semantic approach. When compared to human raters, [[Natural language processing|NLP]] techniques were shown to be reliable and valid in scoring the originality.&lt;ref&gt;Forster, E. A., &amp; Dunbar, K. N. (2009). Creativity evaluation through latent semantic analysis. In Proceedings of the 31st Annual meeting of the Cognitive Science Society (pp. 602–607).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harbison, I. J., &amp; Haarmann, H. (2014). Automated scoring of originality using semantic representations. In Proceedings of the 36th Annual meeting of the Cognitive Science Society (poster paper).&lt;/ref&gt; The reported computer programs were able to achieve a correlation of 0.60 and 0.72 respectively to human graders.

Semantic networks were also used to devise originality scores that yielded significant correlations with socio-personal measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Acar | first1 = S. | last2 = Runco | first2 = M.

=== Social-personality approach ===
Some researchers have taken a social-personality approach to the measurement of creativity. In these studies, personality traits such as independence of judgement, self-confidence, attraction to complexity, aesthetic orientation, and risk-taking are used as measures of the creativity of individuals.&lt;ref name="Sternberg99" /&gt; A [[meta-analysis]] by Gregory Feist showed that creative people tend to be "more open to new experiences, less conventional and less conscientious, more self-confident, self-accepting, driven, ambitious, dominant, hostile, and impulsive." Openness, conscientiousness, self-acceptance, hostility, and impulsivity had the strongest effects of the traits listed.&lt;ref name=Feist /&gt; Within the framework of the [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five]] model of personality, some consistent traits have emerged.&lt;ref name="Batey, M. 2006 p. 355-429"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Batey | first1 = M. | last2 = Furnham | first2 = A. | year = 2006 | title = Creativity, intelligence and personality: A critical review of the scattered literature | url = | journal = Genetic, Social, and General Psychology Monographs | volume = 132 | issue = 4| pages = 355–429 | doi=10.3200/mono.132.4.355-430}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Openness to experience]] has been shown to be consistently related to a whole host of different assessments of creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Batey | first1 = M. | last2 = Furnham | first2 = A.

Compared to non-artists, artists tend to have higher levels of openness to experience and lower levels of conscientiousness, while scientists are more open to experience, [[Conscientiousness|conscientious]], and higher in the confidence-dominance facets of extraversion compared to non-scientists.&lt;ref name=Feist&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Feist | first1 = G.

=== Self-report questionnaires ===
An alternative are biographical methods. These methods use quantitative characteristics such as the number of publications, patents, or performances of a work. While this method was originally developed for highly creative personalities, today it is also available as [[Self-report study#Questionnaires and interviews|self-report questionnaires]] supplemented with frequent, less outstanding creative behaviors such as writing a short story or creating your own recipes. For example, the [[Creativity Achievement Questionnaire|Creative Achievement Questionnaire]], a self-report test that measures creative achievement across 10 domains, was described in 2005 and shown to be reliable and valid when compared to other measures of creativity and to independent evaluation of creative output.&lt;ref&gt;(Carson, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the English original, it was also used in a Chinese,&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ying-Yao|first=Wang, Chia-Chi{{!}}Ho, Hsiao-Chi{{!}}Cheng, Chih-Ling{{!}}Cheng|date=2014-00-00|title=Application of the Rasch Model to the Measurement of Creativity: The Creative Achievement Questionnaire.|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1088863|journal=Creativity Research Journal|language=en|volume=26|issue=1|issn=1040-0419}}&lt;/ref&gt; French,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bendetowicz|first=David|last2=Urbanski|first2=Marika|last3=Aichelburg|first3=Clarisse|last4=Levy|first4=Richard|last5=Volle|first5=Emmanuelle|date=2017-01|title=Brain morphometry predicts individual creative potential and the ability to combine remote ideas|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0010945216303161|journal=Cortex|volume=86|pages=216–229|doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2016.10.021|pmid=27919546|issn=0010-9452}}&lt;/ref&gt; and German-speaking&lt;ref name="Form 440–450"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Form|first=Sven|last2=Schlichting|first2=Kerrin|last3=Kaernbach|first3=Christian|date=2017-11|title=Mentoring functions: Interpersonal tensions are associated with mentees' creative achievement.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|language=en|volume=11|issue=4|pages=440–450|doi=10.1037/aca0000103|issn=1931-390X}}&lt;/ref&gt; version.

== Creativity and intelligence ==
The potential relationship between creativity and [[intelligence]] has been of interest since the late 1900s, when a multitude of influential studies – from Getzels &amp; Jackson,&lt;ref name="Getzels, J. W. 1962"&gt;Getzels, J. W., &amp; Jackson, P. W. (1962). Creativity and intelligence: Explorations with gifted students. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Barron,&lt;ref name="Barron, F. 1963"&gt;Barron, F. (1963). Creativity and psychological health. Princeton: D. Van Nostrand Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallach &amp; Kogan,&lt;ref name="Wallach, M. A. 1965"&gt;Wallach, M. A., &amp; Kogan, N. (1965). Modes of thinking in young children: A study of the creativity-intelligence distinction. New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston.&lt;/ref&gt; and Guilford&lt;ref name="Guilford, J. P. 1967"&gt;Guilford, J. P. (1967). The nature of human intelligence. New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; – focused not only on creativity, but also on intelligence. This joint focus highlights both the theoretical and practical importance of the relationship: researchers are interested not only if the constructs are related, but also how and why.&lt;ref&gt;Plucker, J., &amp; Renzulli, J. S. (1999). Psychometric approaches to the study of human creativity. In R. J. Sternberg (Ed.), Handbook of creativity (pp. 35–60). New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are multiple theories accounting for their relationship, with the 3 main theories as follows:

*Threshold Theory – Intelligence is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for creativity. There is a moderate positive relationship between creativity and intelligence until IQ ~120.&lt;ref name="Barron, F. 1963" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guilford, J. P. 1967" /&gt;
*Certification Theory – Creativity is not intrinsically related to intelligence. Instead, individuals are required to meet the requisite level intelligence in order to gain a certain level of education/work, which then in turn offers the opportunity to be creative. Displays of creativity are moderated by intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, J. R. (1989). Cognitive processes in creativity. In J. A. Glover, R. R. Ronning, &amp; C. R. Reynolds (Eds.), Handbook of creativity (pp. 135–145). New York: Plenum.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Interference Theory – Extremely high intelligence might interfere with creative ability.&lt;ref name="Sternberg, R. J. 1996"&gt;Sternberg, R. J. (1996). Successful Intelligence. NewYork: Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sternberg and O’Hara&lt;ref name="Sternberg, R. J. 1999 pp. 251"&gt;Sternberg, R. J., &amp; O’Hara, L. A. (1999). Creativity and intelligence. In R. J. Sternberg (Ed.), Handbook of creativity (pp. 251–272). Cambridge, MA: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a framework of 5 possible relationships between creativity and intelligence:
#Creativity is a subset of intelligence
#Intelligence is a subset of creativity
#Creativity and intelligence are overlapping constructs
#Creativity and intelligence are part of the same construct (coincident sets)
#Creativity and intelligence are distinct constructs (disjoint sets)

=== Creativity as a subset of intelligence ===
A number of researchers include creativity, either explicitly or implicitly, as a key component of intelligence.

''Examples of theories that include creativity as a subset of intelligence''

*Gardner’s  [[Theory of multiple intelligences]] (MIT)&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, H. (1993). Creating minds. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; – implicitly includes creativity as a subset of MIT. To demonstrate this, Gardner cited examples of different famous creators, each of whom differed in their types of intelligences e.g. Picasso (spatial intelligence); Freud (intrapersonal); Einstein (logical-mathematical); and Gandhi (interpersonal).
*Sternberg’s Theory of Successful intelligence&lt;ref name="Sternberg, R. J. 1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sternberg, R. J. 1999 pp. 251" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sternberg, R. J., Kaufman, J. C., &amp; Grigorenko, E. L. (2008). Applied intelligence. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Triarchic theory of intelligence]]) includes creativity as a main component, and comprises 3 sub-theories: Componential (Analytic), Contextual (Practical), and Experiential (Creative). Experiential sub-theory – the ability to use pre-existing knowledge and skills to solve new and novel problems – is directly related to creativity.
*The [[Cattell–Horn–Carroll theory]] includes creativity as a subset of intelligence. Specifically, it is associated with the broad group factor of long-term storage and retrieval (Glr). Glr narrow abilities relating to creativity include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kaufman | first1 = J. C. | last2 = Kaufman | first2 = S. B. | last3 = Lichtenberger | first3 = E. O. | year = 2011 | title = Finding creativity on intelligence tests via divergent production | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of School Psychology | volume = 26 | issue = | pages = 83–106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ideational fluency, associational fluency, and originality/creativity. Silvia et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Silvia | first1 = P. J. | last2 = Beaty | first2 = R. E. | last3 = Nusbaum | first3 = E.

Martindale&lt;ref&gt;Martindale, C. (1999). Biological bases of creativity. In R. J. Sternberg (Ed.), Handbook of creativity (pp. 137– 152). New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; extended the CHC-theory in the sense that it was proposed that those individuals who are creative are also selective in their processing speed Martindale argues that in the creative process, larger amounts of information are processed more slowly in the early stages, and as the individual begins to understand the problem, the processing speed is increased.
*The Dual Process Theory of Intelligence&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, J.C., Kaufman, S.B., &amp; Plucker, J.A. (2013). Contemporary theories of intelligence. In J. Reisberg (Ed.), The Oxford Handbook of Cognitive Psychology (pp. 811-822). New York, NY: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; posits a two-factor/type model of intelligence. Type 1 is a conscious process, and concerns goal directed thoughts, which are explained by ''g''. Type 2 is an unconscious process, and concerns spontaneous cognition, which encompasses daydreaming and implicit learning ability. Kaufman argues that creativity occurs as a result of Type 1 and Type 2 processes working together in combination. The use of each type in the creative process can be used to varying degrees.

=== Intelligence as a subset of creativity ===
In this relationship model, intelligence is a key component in the development of creativity.

''Theories of creativity that include intelligence as a subset of creativity''

*Sternberg &amp; Lubart’s Investment Theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sternberg | first1 = R. J. | last2 = Lubart | first2 = T. I. | year = 1991 | title = An investment theory of creativity and its development | url = | journal = Human Development | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 1–32 | doi=10.1159/000277029}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sternberg | first1 = R. J. | last2 = Lubart | first2 = T. I. | year = 1992 | title = Buy low and sell high: An investment approach to creativity | url = | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 1 | issue = 1| pages = 1–5 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.1992.tb00002.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the metaphor of a stock market, they demonstrate that creative thinkers are like good investors – they buy low and sell high (in their ideas). Like under/low-valued stock, creative individuals generate unique ideas that are initially rejected by other people. The creative individual has to persevere, and convince the others of the ideas value. After convincing the others, and thus increasing the ideas value, the creative individual ‘sells high’ by leaving the idea with the other people, and moves onto generating another idea. According to this theory, six distinct, but related elements contribute to successful creativity: intelligence, knowledge, thinking styles, personality, motivation, and environment. Intelligence is just one of the six factors that can either solely, or in conjunction with the other five factors, generate creative thoughts.
*Amabile’s Componential Model of Creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Amabile | first1 = T. M. | year = 1982 | title = Social psychology of creativity: A consensual assessment technique | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 43 | issue = 5| pages = 997–1013 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.43.5.997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amabile, T. M. (1996). Creativity in context: Update to "The Social Psychology of Creativity". Boulder: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, there are 3 within-individual components needed for creativity – domain-relevant skills, creativity-relevant processes, and task motivation – and 1 component external to the individual: their surrounding social environment. Creativity requires a confluence of all components. High creativity will result when an individual is: intrinsically motivated, possesses both a high level of domain-relevant skills and has high skills in creative thinking, and is working in a highly creative environment.
*Amusement Park Theoretical Model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baer | first1 = J. | last2 = Kaufman | first2 = J. C. | year = 2005 | title = Bridging generality and specificity: The Amusement Park Theoretical (APT) Model of creativity | url = | journal = Roeper Review | volume = 27 | issue = 3| pages = 158–163 | doi=10.1080/02783190509554310}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this 4-step theory, both domain-specific and generalist views are integrated into a model of creativity. The researchers make use of the metaphor of the amusement park to demonstrate that within each of these creative levels, intelligence plays a key role:
**To get into the amusement park, there are initial requirements (e.g., time/transport to go to the park). Initial requirements (like intelligence) are necessary, but not sufficient for creativity. They are more like prerequisites for creativity, and if an individual does not possess the basic level of the initial requirement (intelligence), then they will not be able to generate creative thoughts/behaviour.
**Secondly are the subcomponents – general thematic areas – that increase in specificity. Like choosing which type of amusement park to visit (e.g. a zoo or a water park), these areas relate to the areas in which someone could be creative (e.g. poetry).
**Thirdly, there are specific domains. After choosing the type of park to visit e.g. waterpark, you then have to choose which specific park to go to. Within the poetry domain, there are many different types (e.g. free verse, riddles, sonnet, etc.) that have to be selected from.
**Lastly, there are micro-domains. These are the specific tasks that reside within each domain e.g. individual lines in a free verse poem / individual rides at the waterpark.

=== Creativity and intelligence as overlapping yet distinct constructs ===
This possible relationship concerns creativity and intelligence as distinct, but intersecting constructs.

''Theories that include Creativity and Intelligence as Overlapping Yet Distinct Constructs''

*Renzulli’s Three-Ring Conception of Giftedness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Renzulli | first1 = J. S. | year = 1978 | title = What makes giftedness? Reexamining a definition | url = | journal = Phi Delta Kappan | volume = 60 | issue = | pages = 180–261 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this conceptualisation, giftedness occurs as a result from the overlap of above average intellectual ability, creativity, and task commitment. Under this view, creativity and intelligence are distinct constructs, but they do overlap under the correct conditions.
*[[PASS theory of intelligence]]. In this theory, the planning component – relating to the ability to solve problems, make decisions and take action – strongly overlaps with the concept of creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Naglieri | first1 = J. A. | last2 = Kaufman | first2 = J. C. | year = 2001 | title = Understanding intelligence, giftedness, and creativity using PASS theory | url = | journal = Roeper Review | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 151–156 | doi=10.1080/02783190109554087}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Threshold Theory (TT). A number of previous research findings have suggested that a threshold exists in the relationship between creativity and intelligence – both constructs are moderately positively correlated up to an IQ of ~120. Above this threshold of an IQ of 120, if there is a relationship at all, it is small and weak.&lt;ref name="Getzels, J. W. 1962" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barron, F. 1963" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Torrance, E. P. (1962). Guiding creative talent. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; TT posits that a moderate level of intelligence is necessary for creativity.

In support of the TT, Barron&lt;ref name="Barron, F. 1963" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barron, F. (1969). Creative person and creative process. New York: Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston.&lt;/ref&gt; reported finding a non-significant correlation between creativity and intelligence in a gifted sample; and a significant correlation in a non-gifted sample. Yamamoto&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yamamoto | first1 = K | year = 1964 | title = Creativity and sociometric choice among adolescents | url = | journal = Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 64 | issue = 2| pages = 249–261 | doi=10.1080/00224545.1964.9919564| pmid = 14238998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in a sample of secondary school children, reported a significant correlation between creativity and intelligence of ''r'' = .3, and reported no significant correlation when the sample consisted of gifted children. Fuchs-Beauchamp et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fuchs-Beauchamp | first1 = K. D. | last2 = Karnes | first2 = M. B. | last3 = Johnson | first3 = L.

Cho et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cho | first1 = S. H. | last2 = Nijenhuis | first2 = J. T. | last3 = van Vianen | first3 = N. E.

Jauk et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jauk | first1 = E. | last2 = Benedek | first2 = M. | last3 = Dunst | first3 = B. | last4 = Neubauer | first4 = A.

Much modern day research reports findings against TT. Wai et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wai | first1 = J. | last2 = Lubinski | first2 = D. | last3 = Benbow | first3 = C. P. | year = 2005 | title = Creativity and occupational accomplishments among intellectually precocious youths: An age 13 to age 33 longitudinal study | url = | journal = Journal of Educational Psychology | volume = 97 | issue = 3| pages = 484–492 | doi=10.1037/0022-0663.97.3.484}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a study using data from the longitudinal Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth – a cohort of elite students from early adolescence into adulthood – found that differences in SAT scores at age 13 were predictive of creative real-life outcomes 20 years later. Kim’s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kim | first1 = K. H. | year = 2005 | title = Can only intelligent people be creative? | url = | journal = Journal of Secondary Gifted Education | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 57–66 }}&lt;/ref&gt; meta-analysis of 21 studies did not find any supporting evidence for TT, and instead negligible correlations were reported between intelligence, creativity, and divergent thinking both below and above IQ's of 120. Preckel et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Preckel | first1 = F. | last2 = Holling | first2 = H. | last3 = Wiese | first3 = M. | year = 2006 | title = Relationship of intelligence and creativity in gifted and non-gifted students: An investigation of threshold theory | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 40 | issue = | pages = 159–170 | doi=10.1016/j.paid.2005.06.022}}&lt;/ref&gt; investigating fluid intelligence and creativity, reported small correlations of ''r'' = .3 to ''r'' = .4 across all levels of cognitive ability.

=== Creativity and intelligence as coincident sets ===
Under this view, researchers posit that there are no differences in the mechanisms underlying creativity in those used in normal problem solving; and in normal problem solving, there is no need for creativity. Thus, creativity and Intelligence (problem solving) are the same thing. Perkins&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, D. N. (1981) The mind’s best work. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; referred to this as the ‘nothing-special’ view.

Weisberg &amp; Alba&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weisberg | first1 = R. W. | last2 = Alba | first2 = J. W. | year = 1981 | title = An examination of the alleged role of "fixation" in the solution of several "insight" problems | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: General | volume = 110 | issue = 2| pages = 169–192 | doi=10.1037/0096-3445.110.2.169}}&lt;/ref&gt; examined problem solving by having participants complete the 9-dot problem (see [[Thinking outside the box#Nine dots puzzle]]) – where the participants are asked to connect all 9 dots in the 3 rows of 3 dots using 4 straight lines or less, without lifting their pen or tracing the same line twice. The problem can only be solved if the lines go outside the boundaries of the square of dots. Results demonstrated that even when participants were given this insight, they still found it difficult to solve the problem, thus showing that to successfully complete the task it is not just insight (or creativity) that is required.

=== Creativity and intelligence as disjoint sets ===
In this view, creativity and intelligence are completely different, unrelated constructs.

Getzels and Jackson&lt;ref name="Getzels, J. W. 1962" /&gt; administered 5 creativity measures to a group of 449 children from grades 6-12, and compared these test findings to results from previously administered (by the school) IQ tests. They found that the correlation between the creativity measures and IQ was ''r'' = .26. The high creativity group scored in the top 20% of the overall creativity measures, but were not included in the top 20% of IQ scorers. The high intelligence group scored the opposite: they scored in the top 20% for IQ, but were outside the top 20% scorers for creativity, thus showing that creativity and intelligence are distinct and unrelated.

However, this work has been heavily criticised. Wallach and Kogan&lt;ref name="Wallach, M. A. 1965" /&gt; highlighted that the creativity measures were not only weakly related to one another (to the extent that they were no more related to one another than they were with IQ), but they seemed to also draw upon non-creative skills. McNemar&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McNemar | first1 = O | year = 1964 | title = Lost: Our Intelligence? Why? | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 19 | issue = 12| pages = 871–882 | doi=10.1037/h0042008}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted that there were major measurement issues, in that the IQ scores were a mixture from 3 different IQ tests.

Wallach and Kogan&lt;ref name="Wallach, M. A. 1965" /&gt; administered 5 measures of creativity, each of which resulted in a score for originality and fluency; and 10 measures of general intelligence to 151 5th grade children. These tests were untimed, and given in a game-like manner (aiming to facilitate creativity). Inter-correlations between creativity tests were on average ''r'' = .41. Inter-correlations between intelligence measures were on average ''r'' = .51 with each other. Creativity tests and intelligence measures correlated ''r'' = .09.

== Neuroscience ==
The [[neuroscience]] of creativity looks at the operation of the brain during creative behaviour. It has been addressed&lt;ref name="NeuroPsychiatry"&gt;[http://neurology.med.ohio-state.edu/cognitivelab/CreativityMechanisms.pdf Kenneth M Heilman, MD, Stephen E. Nadeau, MD, and David Q. Beversdorf, MD. "Creative Innovation: Possible Brain Mechanisms" Neurocase (2003)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319130652/http://neurology.med.ohio-state.edu/cognitivelab/CreativityMechanisms.pdf |date=2009-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the article "Creative Innovation: Possible Brain Mechanisms." The authors write that "creative innovation might require coactivation and communication between regions of the brain that ordinarily are not strongly connected." Highly creative people who excel at creative innovation tend to differ from others in three ways:
* they have a high level of specialized knowledge,
* they are capable of [[convergent and divergent production|divergent thinking]] mediated by the [[frontal lobe]].
* and they are able to modulate [[neurotransmitter]]s such as [[norepinephrine]] in their frontal lobe.

Thus, the frontal lobe appears to be the part of the [[cerebral cortex|cortex]] that is most important for creativity.

This article also explored the links between creativity and sleep, [[mood disorder|mood]] and [[substance dependence|addiction disorders]], and [[depression (mood)|depression]].

In 2005, Alice Flaherty presented a three-factor model of the creative drive. Drawing from evidence in brain imaging, drug studies and lesion analysis, she described the creative drive as resulting from an interaction of the frontal lobes, the [[temporal lobe]]s, and [[dopamine]] from the [[limbic system]]. The frontal lobes can be seen as responsible for idea generation, and the temporal lobes for idea editing and evaluation. Abnormalities in the frontal lobe (such as depression or anxiety) generally decrease creativity, while abnormalities in the temporal lobe often increase creativity. High activity in the temporal lobe typically inhibits activity in the frontal lobe, and vice versa. High dopamine levels increase general [[arousal]] and goal directed behaviors and reduce [[latent inhibition]], and all three effects increase the drive to generate ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Flaherty AW | year = 2005 | title = Frontotemporal and dopaminergic control of idea generation and creative drive | url = | journal = J Comp Neurol | volume = 493 | issue = 1| pages = 147–53 | pmid = 16254989 | pmc = 2571074 | doi=10.1002/cne.20768}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2015 study on creativity found that it involves the interaction of multiple neural networks, including those that support associative thinking, along with other [[default mode network]] functions.&lt;ref name=PMID_26003860&gt;{{ cite journal |last1 = Mayseless |first1 = Naama |last2 = Eran |first2 = Ayelet |last3 = Shamay-Tsoory |first3 = Simone G |year = 2015 |title = Generating original ideas: The neural underpinning of originality. |journal = NeuroImage |quote = These results are in line with the dual model of creativity, according to which original ideas are a product of the interaction between a system that generates ideas and a control system that evaluates these ideas. |laysummary = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26003860 |doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.05.030|pmid = 26003860 |pages = 232–9 |volume = 116 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Working memory and the cerebellum ===
Vandervert&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert 2003a, 2003b; Vandervert, Schimpf &amp; Liu, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; described how the brain's frontal lobes and the cognitive functions of the [[cerebellum]] collaborate to produce creativity and innovation. Vandervert's explanation rests on considerable evidence that all processes of [[working memory]] (responsible for processing all thought&lt;ref&gt;Miyake &amp; Shah, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;) are adaptively modeled for increased efficiency by the cerebellum.&lt;ref&gt;Schmahmann, 1997, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The cerebellum (consisting of 100 billion neurons, which is more than the entirety of the rest of the brain&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, Korbo &amp; Pakkenberg, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;) is also widely known to adaptively model all bodily movement for efficiency. The cerebellum's adaptive models of working memory processing are then fed back to especially frontal lobe working memory control processes&lt;ref&gt;Miller &amp; Cohen, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; where creative and innovative thoughts arise.&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert, 2003a&lt;/ref&gt; (Apparently, creative insight or the "aha" experience is then triggered in the temporal lobe.&lt;ref&gt;Jung-Beeman, Bowden, Haberman, Frymiare, Arambel-Liu, Greenblatt, Reber &amp; Kounios, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;)

According to Vandervert, the details of creative adaptation begin in "forward" cerebellar models which are anticipatory/exploratory controls for movement and thought. These cerebellar processing and control architectures have been termed Hierarchical Modular Selection and Identification for Control (HMOSAIC).&lt;ref&gt;Imamizu, Kuroda, Miyauchi, Yoshioka &amp; Kawato, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; New, hierarchically arranged levels of the cerebellar control architecture (HMOSAIC) develop as mental mulling in working memory is extended over time. These new levels of the control architecture are fed forward to the frontal lobes. Since the cerebellum adaptively models all movement and all levels of thought and emotion,&lt;ref&gt;Schmahmann, 2004,&lt;/ref&gt; Vandervert's approach helps explain creativity and innovation in sports, art, music, the design of video games, technology, mathematics, the [[child prodigy]], and thought in general.

Essentially, Vandervert has argued that when a person is confronted with a challenging new situation, visual-spatial working memory and speech-related working memory are decomposed and re-composed (fractionated) by the cerebellum and then blended in the cerebral cortex in an attempt to deal with the new situation. With repeated attempts to deal with challenging situations, the cerebro-cerebellar blending process continues to optimize the efficiency of how working memory deals with the situation or problem.&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert, in press-a&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently, he has argued that this is the same process (only involving visual-spatial working memory and pre-language vocalization) that led to the evolution of language in humans.&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert, 2011, in press-b&lt;/ref&gt; Vandervert and Vandervert-Weathers have pointed out that this blending process, because it continuously optimizes efficiencies, constantly improves prototyping attempts toward the invention or innovation of new ideas, music, art, or technology.&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert &amp; Vandervert-Weathers, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Prototyping, they argue, not only produces new products, it trains the cerebro-cerebellar pathways involved to become more efficient at prototyping itself. Further, Vandervert and Vandervert-Weathers believe that this repetitive "mental prototyping" or mental rehearsal involving the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex explains the success of the self-driven, individualized patterning of repetitions initiated by the teaching methods of the [[Khan Academy]]. The model proposed by Vandervert has, however, received incisive critique from several authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = J. | year = 2007 | title = On Vandervert et al.

=== REM sleep ===
Creativity involves the forming of associative elements into new combinations that are useful or meet some requirement. Sleep aids this process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature02223 |author1=Wagner U. |author2=Gais S. |author3=Haider H. |author4=Verleger R. |author5=Born J. | year = 2004 | title = Sleep inspires insight | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 427 | issue = 6972| pages = 352–5 | pmid = 14737168 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rapid eye movement sleep|REM]] rather than [[Non-rapid eye movement sleep|NREM sleep]] appears to be responsible.&lt;ref name="Cai"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0900271106 |author1=Cai D.

It is proposed that REM sleep adds creativity by allowing "neocortical structures to reorganize associative hierarchies, in which information from the hippocampus would be reinterpreted in relation to previous semantic representations or nodes."&lt;ref name="Cai" /&gt;

== Affect ==
Some theories suggest that creativity may be particularly susceptible to affective influence. As noted in [[voting behavior]], the term "affect" in this context can refer to liking or disliking key aspects of the subject in question. This work largely follows from findings in psychology regarding the ways in which affective states are involved in human judgment and decision-making.&lt;ref name=Winkielman2007&gt;{{Citation

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Positive affect relations ===
According to [[Alice M. Isen|Alice Isen]], positive affect has three primary effects on cognitive activity:
# Positive affect makes additional cognitive material available for processing, increasing the number of cognitive elements available for association;
# Positive affect leads to defocused attention and a more complex cognitive context, increasing the breadth of those elements that are treated as relevant to the problem;
# Positive affect increases cognitive flexibility, increasing the probability that diverse cognitive elements will in fact become associated. Together, these processes lead positive affect to have a positive influence on creativity.

[[Barbara Fredrickson]] in her [[broaden-and-build]] model suggests that positive emotions such as joy and love broaden a person's available repertoire of cognitions and actions, thus enhancing creativity.

According to these researchers, positive emotions increase the number of cognitive elements available for association (attention scope) and the number of elements that are relevant to the problem (cognitive scope).

Various meta-analyses, such as Baas et al. (2008) of 66 studies about creativity and affect support the link between creativity and positive affect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mark A.

== Creativity and artificial intelligence ==
[[Jürgen Schmidhuber]]'s formal [[theory]] of creativity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidhuber | first1 = Jürgen | year = 2006 | title = Developmental Robotics, Optimal Artificial Curiosity, Creativity, Music, and the Fine Arts | url = | journal = Connection Science | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 173–187 | doi=10.1080/09540090600768658| citeseerx = 10.1.1.474.6919 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidhuber | first1 = Jürgen | year = 2010 | title = Formal Theory of Creativity, Fun, and Intrinsic Motivation (1990–2010) | url = | journal = IEEE Transactions on Autonomous Mental Development | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 230–247 | doi=10.1109/tamd.2010.2056368}}&lt;/ref&gt; postulates that creativity, curiosity, and interestingness are by-products of a simple [[Computational learning theory|computational]] principle for measuring and optimizing learning progress. Consider an agent able to manipulate its environment and thus its own [[sensory system|sensory]] inputs. The agent can use a [[black box]] optimization method such as [[reinforcement learning]] to learn (through informed trial and error) sequences of actions that maximize the expected sum of its future [[reward system|reward]] signals. There are extrinsic reward signals for achieving externally given goals, such as finding food when hungry. But Schmidhuber's [[Loss function|objective function]] to be maximized also includes an additional, intrinsic term to model "wow-effects." This non-standard term motivates purely creative behavior of the agent even when there are no external goals. A wow-effect is formally defined as follows. As the agent is creating and predicting and encoding the continually growing history of actions and sensory inputs, it keeps improving the predictor or encoder, which can be implemented as an [[artificial neural network]] or some other [[machine learning]] device that can exploit regularities in the data to improve its performance over time. The improvements can be measured precisely, by computing the difference in computational costs (storage size, number of required synapses, errors, time) needed to encode new observations before and after learning. This difference depends on the encoder's present subjective knowledge, which changes over time, but the theory formally takes this into account. The cost difference measures the strength of the present "wow-effect" due to sudden improvements in [[data compression]] or computational speed. It becomes an intrinsic reward signal for the action selector. The objective function thus motivates the action optimizer to create action sequences causing more wow-effects. Irregular, random data (or noise) do not permit any wow-effects or learning progress, and thus are "boring" by nature (providing no reward). Already known and predictable regularities also are boring. Temporarily interesting are only the initially unknown, novel, regular patterns in both actions and observations. This motivates the agent to perform continual, open-ended, active, creative exploration.

According to Schmidhuber, his objective function explains the activities of scientists, artists, and [[comedian]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Video of [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]]'s keynote at the 2011 Winter Intelligence Conference, Oxford: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnbZzcruGu0 Universal AI and Theory of Fun and Creativity.

Youtube, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, [[physicist]]s are motivated to create experiments leading to observations obeying previously unpublished [[physical law]]s permitting better [[data compression]]. Likewise, composers receive intrinsic reward for creating non-arbitrary melodies with unexpected but regular harmonies that permit wow-effects through data compression improvements.
Similarly, a comedian gets intrinsic reward for "inventing a novel joke with an unexpected [[punch line]], related to the beginning of the story in an initially unexpected but quickly learnable way that also allows for better compression of the perceived data."&lt;ref&gt;Kurzweil AI: [http://www.kurzweilai.net/when-creative-machines-overtake-man Transcript] of [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]]'s TEDx talk (2012): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ35zNlyG-o&amp;list=PL194623EBA834DB77&amp;index=11 When creative machines overtake man]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Creativity and mental illness}}
A study by psychologist [[J. Philippe Rushton]] found creativity to correlate with [[intelligence]] and [[psychoticism]].&lt;ref&gt;(Rushton, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found creativity to be greater in [[Schizotypal personality disorder|schizotypal]] than in either normal or [[Schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] individuals. While divergent thinking was associated with bilateral activation of the [[prefrontal cortex]], schizotypal individuals were found to have much greater activation of their ''right'' prefrontal cortex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.schres.2005.06.016 |pmid=16125369 |url=http://exploration.vanderbilt.edu/news/news_schizotypes.htm |accessdate=2006-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060215212520/http://exploration.vanderbilt.edu/news/news_schizotypes.htm |archivedate=2006-02-15 |df= |volume=80 |issue=2–3 |title=Verbal creativity and schizotypal personality in relation to prefrontal hemispheric laterality: A behavioral and near-infrared optical imaging study |year=2005 |journal=Schizophrenia Research |pages=271–282 | last1 = Folley | first1 = Bradley S. | last2 = Park | first2 = Sohee|pmc=2817946 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This study hypothesizes that such individuals are better at accessing both hemispheres, allowing them to make novel associations at a faster rate.

Particularly strong links have been identified between creativity and [[mood disorder]]s, particularly [[Bipolar disorder|manic-depressive disorder]] (a.k.a. [[bipolar disorder]]) and [[Major depressive disorder|depressive disorder]] (a.k.a. [[Major depressive disorder|unipolar disorder]]). In ''Touched with Fire: Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament'', [[Kay Redfield Jamison]] summarizes studies of mood-disorder rates in [[writer]]s, [[poet]]s, and [[artist]]s. She also explores research that identifies [[mood disorder]]s in such famous writers and artists as [[Ernest Hemingway]] (who shot himself after [[Electroconvulsive therapy|electroconvulsive treatment]]), [[Virginia Woolf]] (who drowned herself when she felt a depressive episode coming on), composer [[Robert Schumann]] (who died in a mental institution), and even the famed [[Visual arts|visual artist]] [[Michelangelo]]. A different case study suggested for Schumann a difference between bipolar disorder and "creative bipolarity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holm-Hadulla|first=Rainer Matthias|last2=Koutsoukou-Argyraki|first2=Asimina|date=2017|title=Bipolar Disorder and/or Creative Bipolarity: Robert Schumann's Exemplary Psychopathology - Combining Symptomatological and Psychosocial Perspectives with Creativity Research|url=https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/479883|journal=Psychopathology|language=english|volume=50|issue=6|pages=379–388|doi=10.1159/000479883|pmid=29017153|issn=0254-4962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study looking at 300,000 persons with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or unipolar depression, and their relatives, found overrepresentation in creative professions for those with bipolar disorder as well as for undiagnosed siblings of those with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. There was no overall overrepresentation, but overrepresentation for artistic occupations, among those diagnosed with schizophrenia. There was no association for those with unipolar depression or their relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kyaga | first1 = S. | last2 = Lichtenstein | first2 = P. | last3 = Boman | first3 = M. | last4 = Hultman | first4 = C. | last5 = Långström | first5 = N. | last6 = Landén | first6 = M. | title = Creativity and mental disorder: Family study of 300 000 people with severe mental disorder | doi = 10.1192/bjp.bp.110.085316 | journal = The British Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 199 | issue = 5 | pages = 373–379 | year = 2011 | pmid =  21653945| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another case study suggested a difference between severe mood disorders and "creative melancholy", pointing out mild and moderate depression may inspire creative achievements while severe depression inhibits and may even destroy creative activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holm-Hadulla|first=Rainer M.|last2=Roussel|first2=Martin|last3=Hofmann|first3=Frank-Hagen|date=2010-12|title=Depression and creativity — The case of the german poet, scientist and statesman J.

Another study involving more than one million people, conducted by Swedish researchers at the Karolinska Institute, reported a number of correlations between creative occupations and mental illnesses. Writers had a higher risk of anxiety and bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, unipolar depression, and substance abuse, and were almost twice as likely as the general population to kill themselves. Dancers and photographers were also more likely to have bipolar disorder.&lt;ref name="bbc health-19959565"&gt;Roberts, Michelle. Creativity 'closely entwined with mental illness'. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-19959565. 16 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as a group, those in the creative professions were no more likely to suffer from psychiatric disorders than other people, although they were more likely to have a close relative with a disorder, including anorexia and, to some extent, autism, the Journal of Psychiatric Research reports.&lt;ref name="bbc health-19959565" /&gt;

According to psychologist Robert Epstein, PhD, creativity can be obstructed through stress.&lt;ref name="apa.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/gradpsych/2009/01/creativity.aspx|title=The science of creativity|website=apa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Creativity and personality ==
Creativity can be expressed in a number of different forms, depending on unique people and environments. A number of different theorists have suggested models of the creative person. One model suggests that there are kinds to produce growth, innovation, speed, etc. These are referred to as the four "Creativity Profiles" that can help achieve such goals.&lt;ref&gt;(DeGraff, Lawrence 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;
:(i) ''Incubate'' (Long-term Development)
:(ii) ''Imagine'' (Breakthrough Ideas)
:(iii) ''Improve'' (Incremental Adjustments)
:(iv) ''Invest'' (Short-term Goals)

Research by Dr Mark Batey of the Psychometrics at Work Research Group at [[Manchester Business School]] has suggested that the creative profile can be explained by four primary creativity traits with narrow facets within each

: (i) "Idea Generation" (Fluency, Originality, Incubation and Illumination)
: (ii) "Personality" (Curiosity and Tolerance for Ambiguity)
: (iii) "Motivation" (Intrinsic, Extrinsic and Achievement)
: (iv) "Confidence" (Producing, Sharing and Implementing)

This model was developed in a sample of 1000 working adults using the statistical techniques of Exploratory Factor Analysis followed by Confirmatory Factor Analysis by Structural Equation Modelling.&lt;ref&gt;(Batey &amp; Irwing, 2010) {{cite web |url=http://www.e-metrixx.com/creativity-profit/me2-spec/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710161255/http://www.e-metrixx.com/creativity-profit/me2-spec/ |archivedate=2011-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important aspect of the creativity profiling approach is to account for the tension between predicting the creative profile of an individual, as characterised by the [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] approach, and the evidence that team creativity is founded on diversity and difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Nijstad B. A. |author2=De Dreu C. K. | year = 2002 | title = Creativity and Group Innovation | url = | journal = Applied Psychology | volume = 51 | issue = 3| pages = 400–406 | doi = 10.1111/1464-0597.00984 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One characteristic of creative people, as measured by some psychologists, is what is called ''divergent production''. ''Divergent production'' is the ability of a person to generate a diverse assortment, yet an appropriate amount of responses to a given situation.&lt;ref&gt;(Guilford, 1950)&lt;/ref&gt; One way of measuring ''divergent production'' is by administering the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking.&lt;ref&gt;(Torrance, 1974, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt; The Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking assesses the diversity, quantity, and appropriateness of participants responses to a variety of open-ended questions.

Other researchers of creativity see the difference in creative people as a cognitive process of dedication to problem solving and developing expertise in the field of their creative expression. Hard working people study the work of people before them and within their current area, become experts in their fields, and then have the ability to add to and build upon previous information in innovative and creative ways. In a study of projects by design students, students who had more knowledge on their subject on average had greater creativity within their projects.&lt;ref&gt;(Christiaans &amp; Venselaar, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The aspect of motivation within a person's personality may predict creativity levels in the person. Motivation stems from two different sources, intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation is an internal drive within a person to participate or invest as a result of personal interest, desires, hopes, goals, etc. Extrinsic motivation is a drive from outside of a person and might take the form of payment, rewards, fame, approval from others, etc. Although extrinsic motivation and intrinsic motivation can both increase creativity in certain cases, strictly extrinsic motivation often impedes creativity in people.&lt;ref&gt;(Amabile, 1996; Prabhu et al., 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

From a personality-traits perspective, there are a number of traits that are associated with creativity in people.&lt;ref&gt;(Feist, 1998, 1999; Prabhu et al., 2008; Zhang &amp; Sternberg, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Creative people tend to be more open to new experiences, are more self-confident, are more ambitious, self-accepting, impulsive, driven, dominant, and hostile, compared to people with less creativity.

From an evolutionary perspective, creativity may be a result of the outcome of years of generating ideas. As ideas are continuously generated, the need to evolve produces a need for new ideas and developments. As a result, people have been creating and developing new, innovative, and creative ideas to build our progress as a society.&lt;ref&gt;(Campbell, 1960)&lt;/ref&gt;

In studying exceptionally creative people in history, some common traits in lifestyle and environment are often found. Creative people in history usually had supportive parents, but rigid and non-nurturing. Most had an interest in their field at an early age, and most had a highly supportive and skilled mentor in their field of interest. Often the field they chose was relatively uncharted, allowing for their creativity to be expressed more in a field with less previous information. Most exceptionally creative people devoted almost all of their time and energy into their craft, and after about a decade had a creative breakthrough of fame. Their lives were marked with extreme dedication and a cycle of hard-work and breakthroughs as a result of their determination.&lt;ref&gt;(Gardner, 1993a, Policastro &amp; Gardner, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another theory of creative people is the ''investment theory of creativity''. This approach suggest that there are many individual and environmental factors that must exist in precise ways for extremely high levels of creativity opposed to average levels of creativity. In the ''investment'' sense, a person with their particular characteristics in their particular environment may see an opportunity to devote their time and energy into something that has been overlooked by others. The creative person develops an undervalued or under-recognised idea to the point that it is established as a new and creative idea. Just like in the financial world, some investments are worth the buy in, while others are less productive and do not build to the extent that the investor expected. This ''investment theory of creativity'' views creativity in a unique perspective compared to others, by asserting that creativity might rely to some extent on the right investment of effort being added to a field at the right time in the right way.&lt;ref&gt;(Sternberg &amp; Lubart, 1991, 1995, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Malevolent creativity ==
Malevolent creativity (MC) focuses on the "darker side" of creativity.&lt;ref name="The dark side of creativity"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McLaren | first1 = R. B. | year = 1993 | title = The dark side of creativity | url = | journal = Creat. Res. J. | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 137–144 | doi = 10.1080/10400419309534472 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of creativity is not typically accepted within society and is defined by the intention to cause harm to others through original and innovative means. MC should be distinguished from negative creativity in that negative creativity may unintentionally cause harm to others, whereas MC is explicitly malevolently motivated. MC is often a key contributor to crime and in its most destructive form can even manifest as terrorism. However, MC can also be observed in ordinary day-to-day life as lying, cheating and betrayal.&lt;ref name="Measure Malevolent Creativity 2016"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hao | first1 = N | last2 = Tang | first2 = M | last3 = Yang | first3 = J | last4 = Wang | first4 = Q | last5 = Runco | first5 = MA | year = 2016 | title = A New Tool to Measure Malevolent Creativity: The Malevolent Creativity Behavior Scale | url = | journal = Frontiers in Psychology | volume = 7 | issue = | page = 682 | doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00682 | pmid = 27242596 | pmc = 4870273 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although everyone shows some levels of MC under certain conditions, those that have a higher propensity towards malevolent creativity have increased tendencies to deceive and manipulate others to their own gain. Although levels of MC appear to dramatically increase when an individual is placed under unfair conditions, personality is also a key predictor in anticipating levels of malevolent thinking. Researches Harris and Reiter-Palmon investigated the role of aggression in levels of MC, in particular levels of implicit aggression and the tendency to employ aggressive actions in response to problem solving.  The personality traits of physical aggression, conscientiousness, emotional intelligence and implicit aggression all seem to be related with MC.&lt;ref name="The dark side of creativity"/&gt; Harris and Reiter-Palmon's research showed that when subjects were presented with a problem that triggered malevolent creativity, participants high in implicit aggression and low in premeditation expressed the largest number of malevolently-themed solutions. When presented with the more benign problem that triggered prosocial motives of helping others and cooperating, those high in implicit aggression, even if they were high in impulsiveness, were far less destructive in their imagined solutions. They concluded premeditation, more than implicit aggression controlled an individual’s expression of malevolent creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harris | first1 = D.

The current measure for malevolent creativity is the 13 item test Malevolent Creativity Behaviour Scale (MCBS) &lt;ref name="Measure Malevolent Creativity 2016"/&gt;

===Malevolent creativity and crime===
Malevolent creativity has strong links with crime. As creativity requires deviating from the conventional, there is a permanent tension between being creative and producing products that go too far and in some cases to the point of breaking the law. Aggression is a key predictor of malevolent creativity, and studies have also shown that increased levels of aggression also correlates to a higher likelihood of committing crime.&lt;ref&gt;Aggression: A social psychological analysis.

== Creativity across cultures ==
Creativity is viewed differently in different countries.&lt;ref&gt;Sternberg RJ 'Introduction' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (2006) (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' pp 1-9. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, cross-cultural research centred on [[Hong Kong]] found that Westerners view creativity more in terms of the individual attributes of a creative person, such as their aesthetic taste, while Chinese people view creativity more in terms of the social influence of creative people e.g. what they can contribute to society.&lt;ref&gt;Niu W (2006) 'Development of Creativity Research in Chinese Societies' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' pp 386-387. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mpofu et al. surveyed 28 African languages and found that 27 had no word which directly translated to 'creativity' (the exception being [[Arabic]]).&lt;ref&gt;Mpofu E et al (2006) 'African Perspectives on Creativity' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' p 465. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of [[linguistic relativity]], i.e. that language can affect thought, suggests that the lack of an equivalent word for 'creativity' may affect the views of creativity among speakers of such languages. However, more research would be needed to establish this, and there is certainly no suggestion that this linguistic difference makes people any less (or more) creative; [[Africa]] has a rich heritage of creative pursuits such as [[music]], [[art]], and [[storytelling]]. Nevertheless, it is true that there has been very little research on creativity in Africa,&lt;ref&gt;Mpofu E et al (2006) 'African Perspectives on Creativity' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' p 458. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there has also been very little research on creativity in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;Preiss DD and Strasser K (2006) 'Creativity in Latin America' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' p 46. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creativity has been more thoroughly researched in the northern hemisphere, but here again there are cultural differences, even between countries or groups of countries in close proximity. For example, in Scandinavian countries, creativity is seen as an individual attitude which helps in coping with life's challenges,&lt;ref&gt;Smith GJW and Carlsson I (2006) 'Creativity under the Northern Lights' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' p 202. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in Germany, creativity is seen more as a process that can be applied to help solve problems.&lt;ref&gt;Preiser S (2006) 'Creativity Research in German-Speaking Countries' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' p 175. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In organizations ==
[[File:Training meeting in a ecodesign stainless steel company in brazil.JPG|thumb|right|Training meeting in an eco-design stainless steel company in [[Brazil]]. The leaders among other things wish to cheer and encourage the workers in order to achieve a higher level of creativity.]]

It has been the topic of various research studies to establish that organizational effectiveness depends on the creativity of the workforce to a large extent. For any given organization, measures of effectiveness vary, depending upon its mission, environmental context, nature of work, the product or service it produces, and customer demands. Thus, the first step in evaluating organizational effectiveness is to understand the organization itself — how it functions, how it is structured, and what it emphasizes.

Amabile&lt;ref name="Amabile98"&gt;(Amabile, 1998; Sullivan and Harper, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; argued that to enhance creativity in business, three components were needed:
* Expertise (technical, procedural and intellectual knowledge),
* Creative thinking skills (how flexibly and imaginatively people approach problems),
* and Motivation (especially [[intrinsic motivation]]).

There are two types of motivation:
* [[Motivation|extrinsic motivation]] – [[Externality|external]] factors, for example [[threat]]s of being fired or money as a reward,
* [[intrinsic motivation]] – comes from inside an individual, satisfaction, enjoyment of work, etc.

Six managerial practices to encourage motivation are:
* Challenge – matching people with the right assignments;
* Freedom – giving people [[autonomy]] choosing means to achieve goals;
* [[Resource]]s – such as time, money, space, etc. There must be balance fit among resources and people;
* Work group features – [[Cultural diversity|diverse]], supportive teams, where members share the excitement, willingness to help, and recognize each other's talents;
* [[Supervisor]]y encouragement – recognitions, cheering, praising;
* Organizational support – value emphasis, information sharing, [[collaboration]].

Nonaka, who examined several successful Japanese companies, similarly saw creativity and knowledge creation as being important to the success of organizations.&lt;ref name="Nonaka91"&gt;(Nonaka, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, he emphasized the role that [[tacit knowledge]] has to play in the creative process.

In business, [[originality]] is not enough. The idea must also be appropriate—useful and [[Cause of action|actionable]].&lt;ref&gt;Amabile, T. M. (1998). "How to kill creativity". Harvard Business Review&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Siltala, R. 2010. Innovativity and cooperative learning in business life and teaching. University of Turku&lt;/ref&gt; [[Competitive intelligence|Creative competitive intelligence]] is a new solution to solve this problem. According to Reijo Siltala it links creativity to [[innovation]] process and [[competitive intelligence]] to creative workers.

Creativity can be encouraged in people and professionals and in the workplace. It is essential for innovation, and is a factor affecting economic growth and businesses. In 2013, the sociologist Silvia Leal Martín, using the Innova 3DX method, suggested measuring the various parameters that encourage creativity and innovation: corporate culture, work environment, leadership and management, creativity, self-esteem and optimism, locus of control and learning orientation, motivation, and fear.&lt;ref&gt;Leal, S. y Urrea J. "Ingenio y Pasión" (2013), Lid Publishers (Spanish) and Forbes India Magazine http://forbesindia.com/article/ie/new-trends-in-innovation-management/33905/1#ixzz2iiuuDxVq&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, social psychologists, organizational scientists, and management scientists who conduct extensive research on the factors that influence creativity and innovation in teams and organizations have developed integrative theoretical models that emphasize the roles of team composition, team processes, and organizational culture, as well as the mutually reinforcing relationships between them in promoting innovation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Woodman | first1 = R.

The investigation by Loo (2017) &lt;ref&gt;Loo, S. (2017) Creative Working in the Knowledge Economy. Abingdon, Oxfordshire: Routledge Ltd. {{ISBN|9781138211391}}; {{ISBN|9781315453095}}. https://www.routledge.com/Creative-Working-in-the-Knowledge-Economy/Loo/p/book/9781138211391&lt;/ref&gt; on creative working in the knowledge economy brings together studies of creativity as delineated in this web page. It offers connections with the sections on the ‘”Four C” model’, ‘Theories of creative processes’, ‘Creativity as a subset of intelligence’, ‘Creativity and personality’, and ‘In organisations’ It is the last section that the investigation addresses.

Research studies of the knowledge economy may be classified into three levels: macro, meso and micro. Macro studies refer to investigations at a societal or transnational dimension. Meso studies focus on organisations. Micro investigations centre on the minutiae workings of workers. There is also an interdisciplinary dimension such as research from businesses (e.g. Burton-Jones, 1999; Drucker, 1999), economics (e.g. Cortada, 1998; Reich, 2001; Florida, 2003), education (e.g. Farrell and Fenwick, 2007; Brown, Lauder and Ashton, 2011), human resource management (e.g. Davenport, 2005), knowledge and organizational management (Alvesson, 2004; Defillippi, Arthur and Lindsay, 2006; Orr, Nutley, Russell, Bain, Hacking and Moran, 2016), sociology, psychology, and knowledge economy-related sectors – especially information technology (IT) software (e.g. O’Riain, 2004; Nerland, 2008) and advertising (e.g. Grabher, 2004; Lury, 2004) (Loo, 2017).

Loo (2017) studies how individual workers in the knowledge economy use their creativity and know-how in the advertising and IT software sectors. It examines this phenomenon across three developed countries of England, Japan and Singapore to observe global perspectives. Specifically, the study uses qualitative data from semi-structured interviews of the related professionals in the roles of creative directing and copywriting (in advertising), and systems software developing and software programme managing.

The study offers a conceptual framework (Loo, 2017, p.&amp;nbsp;49) of a two-dimensional matrix of individual and collaborative working styles, and single and multi-contexts. The investigation draws on literature sources from the four disciplines of economics (e.g. Reich, 2001; Quah, 2002), management (e.g. ,Drucker, 1994; Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995; von Hippel, 2006), sociology (e.g. Zuboff, 1988; Bell, 1973; Lash and Urry, 1994; Castells, 2000; Knorr Cetina, 2005),  and psychology (e.g. Gardner, 1984; Csikszentmihalyi, 1988; Sternberg, Kaufman and Pretz, 2004). The themes arising from the analysis of knowledge work and creativity literature serve to create a distinct theoretical framework of creative knowledge work.  These workers apply their cognitive abilities, creative personalities and skill sets in the areas of science, technology, or culture industries to invent or discover new possibilities – e.g. a medium, product or service. These work activities may be done individually or collectively. Education, training and ‘encultured environments’ are necessary for the performance of these creative activities. Acts of creativity are viewed as asking new questions over and above those questions asked by an intelligent person, seeking novelty when reviewing a situation (Gardner, 1993), and creating something that is different and novel, i.e. a ‘variation’ on the idea of existing ideas in a domain (Csikszentmihalyi, 1988). This framework is evidenced by the empirical chapters on the micro-workings of creative workers in the two knowledge economy sectors from global perspectives.

This investigation identifies a definition of creative work, three types of work and the necessary conditions for it to occur. These workers use a combination of creative applications including anticipatory imagination, problem-solving, problem seeking, and generating ideas and aesthetic sensibilities. Taking aesthetic sensibilities as an example, for a creative director in the advertising industry, it is a visual imagery whether still or moving via a camera lens, and for a software programmer, it is the innovative technical expertise in which the software is written. There are specific creative applications for each of the sectors such as emotional connection in the advertising sector, and the power of expression and sensitivity in the IT software sector. In addition to the creative applications, creative workers require abilities and aptitudes to carry out their roles. Passion for one’s job is generic. For copywriters, this passion is identified with fun, enjoyment and happiness alongside attributes such as honesty (regarding the product), confidence, and patience in finding the appropriate copy. Knowledge is also required in the disciplines of the humanities (e.g. literature), the creative arts (e.g. painting and music) and technical-related know-how (e.g. mathematics, computer sciences and physical sciences). In the IT software, technical knowledge of computer languages (e.g. C++) is especially significant for programmers whereas the degree of technical expertise may be less for a programme manager, as only knowledge of the relevant language is necessary to understand the issues for communicating with the team of developers and testers.

There are three types of work. One is intra-sectoral (e.g. ‘general sponge’ and ’in tune with the zeitgeist’ [advertising], and ‘power of expression’ and ‘sensitivity’ [IT software]). The second is inter-sectoral (e.g. ‘integration of advertising activities’ [advertising], and ‘autonomous decentralized systems’ [ADS] [IT software]). The third relates to changes in culture/practices in the sectors (e.g. ‘three-dimensional trust’ and ‘green credentials’ [advertising], and ‘collaboration with HEIs and industry’ and ‘ADS system in the Tokyo train operator’ [IT software]).

The necessary conditions for creative work to exist are a supportive environment such as supportive information, communications and electronic technologies (ICET) infrastructure, training, work environment and education.

This investigation has implications for lifelong learning of these workers informally and formally. Teaching institutions need to offer multi-disciplinary knowledge of humanities, arts and sciences and it has impacts on the programme structure, delivery approaches and assessments. At a macro level, governments need to offer a rich diet of cultural activities, outdoor activities and sports fixtures that inform potential creative workers in the areas of video gaming and advertising. This study has implications for work organisations that support and encourage collaborative working alongside individual working, offer opportunities to engage in continuous professional development (formally and informally), and foster an environment, which promotes experiential functioning and supports experimentation.

'''[[Team Composition]]'''

Diversity between team members’ backgrounds and knowledge can increase team creativity by expanding the total collection of unique information that is available to the team and introducing different perspectives that can integrate in novel ways. However, under some conditions, diversity can also decrease team creativity by making it more difficult for team members to communicate about ideas and causing interpersonal conflicts between those with different perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harvey | first1 = S | year = 2013 | title = A different perspective: The multiple effects of deep level diversity on group creativity | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 49 | issue = 5| pages = 822–832 | doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2013.04.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the potential advantages of diversity must be supported by appropriate team processes and organizational cultures in order to enhance creativity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Paletz | first1 = S.

'''Team Processes'''

Team communication [[norm (social)|norm]]s, such as respecting others’ expertise, paying attention to others’ ideas, expecting information sharing, tolerating disagreements, [[negotiation|negotiating]], remaining open to others’ ideas, learning from others, and building on each other’s ideas, increase team creativity by facilitating the social processes involved with [[brainstorming]] and [[problem solving]]. Through these processes, team members are able to access their collective pool of knowledge, reach shared understandings, identify new ways of understanding problems or tasks, and make new connections between ideas. Engaging in these social processes also promotes positive team [[Affect (psychology)|affect]], which facilitates collective creativity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[Organizational culture|'''Organizational Culture''']]

Supportive and motivational environments that create [[psychological safety]] by encouraging risk taking and tolerating mistakes increase team creativity as well.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Organizations in which [[help-seeking]], [[Helping behavior|help giving]], and [[collaboration]] are rewarded promote innovation by providing opportunities and contexts in which team processes that lead to collective creativity can occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hargadon | first1 = A.

==Economic views of creativity==
Economic approaches to creativity have focussed on three aspects — the impact of creativity on economic growth, methods of modelling markets for creativity, and the maximisation of economic creativity (innovation).

In the early 20th century, [[Joseph Schumpeter]] introduced the economic theory of ''[[creative destruction]]'', to describe the way in which old ways of doing things are endogenously destroyed and replaced by the new. Some economists (such as [[Paul Romer]]) view creativity as an important element in the recombination of elements to produce new technologies and products and, consequently, economic growth. Creativity leads to [[capital (economics)|capital]], and creative products are protected by [[intellectual property]] laws.

[[Mark A. Runco]] and Daniel Rubenson have tried to describe a "[[Behavioral economics|psychoeconomic]]" model of creativity.&lt;ref name="RubRunc1992"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0732-118X(92)90021-Q|last=Rubenson|first=Daniel L.|author2=Runco, Mark |authorlink2=Mark A. Runco |title=The psychoeconomic approach to creativity|journal=New Ideas in Psychology|year=1992|volume=10|issue=2|pages=131–147}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such a model, creativity is the product of endowments and active investments in creativity; the costs and benefits of bringing creative activity to market determine the supply of creativity. Such an approach has been criticised for its view of creativity consumption as always having positive [[utility]], and for the way it analyses the value of future innovations.&lt;ref name="Diamond1992"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0732-118X(92)90023-S|last=Diamond|first=Arthur M.|title=Creativity and Interdisciplinarity: A Response to Rubenson and Runco|journal=New Ideas in Psychology|year=1992|volume=10|issue=2|pages=157–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[creative class]]'' is seen by some to be an important driver of modern economies. In his 2002 book, ''The Rise of the Creative Class'', [[economist]] [[Richard Florida]] popularized the notion that regions with "3 T's of economic development: Technology, Talent and Tolerance" also have high concentrations of [[creative professional]]s and tend to have a higher level of economic development.

==Fostering creativity==
{{Main|Creativity techniques}}

Several different researchers have proposed methods of increasing the creativity of an individual. Such ideas range from the [[Psychology|psychological]]-cognitive, such as [[Alex Faickney Osborn|Osborn]]-[[Sid Parnes|Parnes]] [[Creative_problem-solving|Creative Problem Solving Process]], [[Synectics]], science-based creative thinking, Purdue Creative Thinking Program, and [[Edward de Bono]]'s [[lateral thinking]]; to the highly structured, such as [[TRIZ]] (the Theory of Inventive Problem-Solving) and its variant Algorithm of Inventive Problem Solving (developed by the Russian scientist [[Genrich Altshuller]]), and Computer-Aided [[Morphological analysis (problem-solving)|morphological analysis]].

Daniel Pink, in his 2005 book ''A Whole New Mind'', repeating arguments posed throughout the 20th century, argues that we are entering a new age where creativity is becoming increasingly important. In this ''conceptual age'', we will need to foster and encourage ''right-directed thinking'' (representing creativity and emotion) over ''left-directed thinking'' (representing logical, analytical thought). However, this simplification of 'right' versus 'left' brain thinking is not supported by the research data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/lives-the-brain/201004/creativity-the-brain-and-evolution|title=Creativity, the Brain, and Evolution|website=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These include approaches that have been developed by both academia and industry:

==Creativity and education policies==

Some see the conventional system of [[education|schooling]] as "stifling" of creativity and attempt (particularly in the [[preschool]]/[[kindergarten]] and early school years) to provide a creativity-friendly, rich, imagination-fostering environment for young children.&lt;ref name=Nickerson99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name="Csik99handbook"&gt;{{cite book|last=Csíkszentmihályi|first=Mihály|title=Handbook of Creativity|year=1999|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|editor=R.

New York: Harper Perennial.&lt;/ref&gt; To promote creative thinking, educators need to identify what motivates their students and structure teaching around it. Providing students with a choice of activities to complete allows them to become more intrinsically motivated and therefore creative in completing the tasks.&lt;ref name=Nickerson99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Advisory Committee on Creative and Cultural Education (1998).

Teaching students to solve problems that do not have well defined answers is another way to foster their creativity. This is accomplished by allowing students to explore problems and redefine them, possibly drawing on knowledge that at first may seem unrelated to the problem in order to solve it.&lt;ref name=Nickerson99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name=Csik99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name= RobAzzam2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ByrgeHanson2009 /&gt; In adults, mentoring individuals is another way to foster their creativiy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The manifesto : a guide to developing a creative career|last=Torrance|first=E.

===Scotland===
In the [[Education in Scotland|Scottish education system]], creativity is identified as a core skillset for learning, life and work and is defined as “a process which generates ideas that have value to the individual.  It involves looking at familiar things with a fresh eye, examining problems with an open mind, making connections, learning from mistakes and using imagination to explore new possibilities.” [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/practice-exemplars/Creativity%203-18%20curriculum%20review%20(impact%20report)] The need to develop a shared language and understanding of creativity and its role across every aspect of learning, teaching and continuous improvement was identified as a necessary aim [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/learning-resources/Creative%20Learning%20Networks] and a set of four skills is used to allow educators to discuss and develop creativity skills across all subjects and sectors of education – curiosity, open—mindedness, imagination and problem solving. [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/learning-resources/What%20are%20creativity%20skills?] Distinctions are made between creative learning (when learners are using their creativity skills), creative teaching (when educators are using their creativity skills) and creative change (when creativity skills are applied to planning and improvement). [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/documents/creativity/cre24_infographics/cre24-the-big-picture.pdf] Scotland’s national Creative Learning Plan [http://www.creativescotland.com/resources/our-publications/plans-and-strategy-documents/scotlands-creative-learning-plan-2013] supports the development of creativity skills in all learners and of educators’ expertise in developing creativity skills. A range of resources have been created to support and assess this [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/Pages/Search.aspx?k=Creativity%20infographics] including a national review of creativity across learning by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate for Education. [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/practice-exemplars/Creativity%203-18%20curriculum%20review%20(impact%20report)]

===United States===
Creativity has also been identified as one of the key [[21st century skills]] and as one of the  [[Four Cs of 21st century learning]] by educational leaders and theorists in the United States.

'''Daedeok Innopolis''', formerly known as '''Daedeok Science Town''', is the research and development district in the [[Yuseong-gu]] district in [[Daejeon]], [[South Korea]]. Daedeok Innopolis grew out of the research cluster established by President [[Park Chunghee]] in 1973 with the opening of the [[KAIST]]. Over 20 major research institutes and over 40 corporate research centers make up this science cluster. Over the last few years, a number of IT venture companies have sprung up in this region, which has a high concentration of Ph.Ds in the applied sciences. There are 232 research and educational institutions to be found in Daejeon, many in the Daedeok region, among them the [[Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute]] and the [[Korea Aerospace Research Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.metro.daejeon.kr/english/investdaejeon/daedeokvalley/daedeoksciencetown.jsp  |title=Daedeok Science Town  |accessdate=2007-02-21  |publisher=Daejeon Metropolitan City  |deadurl=yes  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061118140735/http://www.metro.daejeon.kr/english/investdaejeon/daedeokvalley/daedeoksciencetown.jsp  |archivedate=2006-11-18  |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The "town" will provide a core for the [[International Science and Business Belt]].

The Daedeok Innopolis logo was created by the industrial design company INNO Design in [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]], USA.

'''''Decoding Reality: The Universe as Quantum Information''''' is a popular [[science book]] by [[Vlatko Vedral]] published by [[Oxford University Press]] in 2010. Vedral examines [[information theory]] and proposes [[information]] as the most fundamental building block of reality. He argues what a useful framework this is for viewing all natural and [[physical phenomena]]. In building out this framework the books touches upon the origin of information, the idea of [[entropy]], the roots of this thinking in [[thermodynamics]], the replication of DNA, development of [[social networks]], [[quantum]] behaviour at the micro and macro level, and the very role of [[indeterminism]] in the universe. The book finishes by considering the answer to the ultimate question: where did all of the information in the Universe come from? The ideas address concepts related to the nature of [[particles]], time, [[determinism]], and of reality itself.

==Contents==

==="Creation Ex Nihilo: Something from Nothing"===
Vedral believes in the principle that information is physical. ''[[Creation ex nihilo]]'' comes from [[Catholic]] dogma, the idea being that God created the universe out of nothing. Vedral says that invoking a supernatural being as an explanation for creation does not explain reality because the supernatural being would have to come into existence itself too somehow presumably from nothing (or else from an infinite regression of supernatural beings), thus of course the reality can come from nothing without a supernatural being. [[Occam's razor]] principle favours the simplest explanation. Vedral believes information is the fundamental building block of reality as it occurs at the macro level (economics, human behaviour etc.) as well as the subatomic level. Vedral argues that information is the only candidate for such a building block that can explain its own existence as information generates additional information that needs to be compressed thus generating more information. 'Annihilation of everything' is a more fitting term than ''creation ex nihilo'' Vedral states, as compression of possibilities is the process of how new information is created.

==="Information for all Seasons"===
Vedral uses an [[Italo Calvino]] philosophical story about a [[tarot]]-like card game as the kernel for his metaphor of conscious life arriving ''[[in medias res]]'' to a pre-existing contextual reality. In this game the individual observers/players (Vedral suggests: quantum physics, thermodynamics, biology, sociology, economics, philosophy) lay down cards with ambiguous meanings as an attempt to communicate messages to deduce meaning out of the other players' interactions. The results (information) of previous rounds establish contextual rules for observers/players in subsequent rounds. The point of this game is not established until the last card has been played as later cards can change the meaning of previous events, as in the case of the quantum explanation for the [[photoelectric effect]] instantly disproving [[classical physics]]. Vedral points out that in our reality there is no last card.

==="Back to Basics: Bits and Pieces"===
[[Entropy (information theory)|Shannon entropy]] or information content measured as the surprise value of a particular event, is essentially inversely proportional to the logarithm of the event's probability, i = log(1/p). [[Claude Shannon]]'s information theory arose from research at [[Bell labs]], building upon [[George Boole|George Boole's]] digital logic. As information theory predicts common and easily predicted words tend to become shorter for optimal communication channel efficiency while less common words tend to be longer for redundancy and [[error correction]]. Vedral compares the process of life to [[John von Neumann]]'s self replicating [[automata]]. These are enduring information carriers that will survive wear and tear of the individual by producing copies that can in turn go on to produce more copies.

==="Digital Romance: Life is a Four-Letter Word"===
Genetic code as an efficient digital information store, containing built in [[codon]] redundancy for error correction in transcription.

==="Murphy’s Law: I Knew this Would Happen to Me"===
Examines the [[Second law of thermodynamics|Second law]] of thermodynamics and the process of information increasing entropy. [[Maxwell's Demon]] was thought to be a way around this inevitability, however such a demon would run out of information storage space and have to delete unwanted data thus having to do work to do so, increasing entropy.

==="Place Your Bets: In It to Win It"===
[[Blackjack]] as controlled risk taking using Shannon's information theory probability formulas. Casino as a ′cool′ financial entropy source and the gambler as a ′hot′ financial source, once again the [[Second law of thermodynamics|Second law]] of thermodynamics means the flow is almost always from hot to cold in the long run. For managed risk spread bets widely and in high risk high reward investments (assuming a known probability), this is the Log optimal portfolio approach.

==="Social Informatics: Get Connected or Die Tryin’"===
[[Six degrees of separation]] means well connected people tend to be more successful as their social networks expose them to more chances to make choices they want. [[Thomas Schelling|Schelling]] precommitment as strategy in social and self-control, for example burning your bridges by buying gym membership to help motivated self win over lazy self. [[Mutual information]] resulting in [[phase transitions]] in social and political demography as well as physical systems, like water freezing into ice at a particular critical temperature or magnetic fields spontaneously aligning in certain atoms when cooling from a molten state.

==="Quantum Schmuntum: Lights, Camera, Action!"===
Vedral examines the basis of [[quantum information]], the [[qubit]], and examines [[one-time pad]] quantum cryptography as the most secure form of [[encryption]] because of its uncomputability. [[Quantum entanglement]] demonstrates the importance of mutual information in defining outcomes in a reality.

==="Surfing the Waves: Hyper-Fast Computers"===
[[Quantum computers]] offer a search advantage over classical computers by searching many database elements at once as a result of quantum [[Quantum superposition|superpositions]]. A sufficiently advanced quantum computer would break current encryption methods by factorizing large numbers several orders of magnitude faster than any existing classical computer. Any computable problem may be expressed as a general quantum search algorithm although classical computers may have an advantage over quantum search when using more efficient tailored classical [[algorithms]]. The issue with quantum computers is that a measurement must be made to determine if the problem is solved which collapses the superposition. Vedral points out that unintentional interaction with the environment can be mitigated with redundancy, and this would be necessary if we were to scale up current quantum computers to achieve greater utility, i.e. to utilize 10 qubits have a 100 atom quantum system so that if one atom decoheres a consensus will still be held by the other 9 for the state of the same qubit.

==="Children of the Aimless Chance: Randomness versus Determinism"===
[[Randomness]] is key to generating new sources of surprise in a reality. Compression of these new sources to discard unimportant information is the [[deterministic]] element and organising principle.

==="Sand Reckoning: Whose Information is It, Anyway?"===
The information content of the universe as measured in [[bit]]s or [[qubits]]. Vedral uses the initial effort of [[Archimedes]] of Syracuse in calculating the [[The Sand Reckoner|amount of sand]] that could theoretically fit inside the universe and compares it to a modern-day attempt to calculate the bit content of the universe. Vedral however sees this content as ultimately limitless as possibly maximum entropy is never reached as compression of complexity is an open ended process and random events will continue to occur. As Vedral sees information as the ultimate building block of physical reality, he speculates that information originating at any scale can force outcomes in all other scales to abide where mutual information is shared. For example, a human performed macro-level scientific test in search of a behaviour in a quantum particle could set parameters for that type of particle in the future when subjected to a similar test.

==="Destruction ab Toto: Nothing from Something"===
The information basis for ''creation ex nihilo''. According to [[John von Neumann]], starting trivially from an [[empty set]] of numbers an [[Infinity|infinite]] sequence of numbers can [[Bootstrapping|bootstrap]] their way out. An empty set creates the number 1 by observing an empty set within itself which is enough of a basis for distinguishability. It creates the number 2 by observing an empty set within the second empty set and the number 1, and so on. Vedral sees this not as creation but as [[data compression]], as every event of a reality breaks the [[symmetry]] of the pre-existing formlessness. Science is the process of describing a large amount of observed phenomena in a compressed programmatic way to predict future outcomes, and in this process of data compression science creates new information by eliminating all contrary possibilities to explain those phenomena.

==Synopsis==
The book explains the world as being made up of information. The Universe and its workings are the ebb and flow of information. We are all transient patterns of information, passing on the recipe for our basic forms to future generations using a four-letter [[Digital data|digital]] code called [[DNA]]. In this engaging and mind-stretching account, Vlatko Vedral considers some of the deepest questions about the Universe and considers the implications of interpreting it in terms of information. He explains the nature of information, the idea of entropy, and the roots of this thinking in [[thermodynamics]]. He describes the bizarre effects of quantum behaviour - effects such as '[[Quantum entanglement|entanglement]]', which [[Einstein]] called 'spooky action at a distance' and explores cutting edge work on the harnessing quantum effects in hyperfast [[quantum computers]], and how recent evidence suggests that the weirdness of the quantum world, once thought limited to the tiniest scales, may reach into the macro world. Vedral finishes by considering the answer to the ultimate question: where did all of the information in the Universe come from? The answers he considers are exhilarating, drawing upon the work of distinguished physicist [[John Archibald Wheeler|John Wheeler]] and his concept of “[[it from bit]]”. The ideas challenge our concept of the nature of particles, of time, of determinism, and of reality itself.

[[Image:El Peru Cover Page.jpg|thumb|Title page of a 1929 edition of ''El Perú'']]

'''''El Perú: Itinerarios de Viajes''''' is an expansive written work covering a variety of topics in the [[natural history]] of [[Peru]], written by the prominent Italian-born Peruvian geographer and scientist [[Antonio Raimondi]] in the latter half of the 19th century.  The work was compiled from extensive and detailed notes Raimondi took while criss-crossing the country, studying the nation's geography, geology, meteorology, botany, zoology, ethnography, and archaeology; ''El Perú'' focuses to some extent on each of these topics and others.  The first volume was published in 1874; several more volumes were published both before Raimondi's death and posthumously from his notes, the last being released in 1913, making a five volume set.  The volumes are a classic example of exploration scholarship, and form one of the earliest and broadest scientific reviews of Peru's natural and cultural heritage.

'''Fact-finding''' is the job of a person or group of persons in a judicial or administrative proceeding that has or have the responsibility of determining the facts relevant to decide a controversy. The term '''[[trier of fact]]''' generally denotes the same function.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/fact-finding Law Dictionary: Fact-Finder]. Accessed 17 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The process is an extremely important part of the communication process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colorado.edu/conflict/peace/problem/factfinding.htm General Information on Fact-Finding]. Colorado University. Accessed 17 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Fact-finding was first established during the [[Hague Convention of 1907]], which dealt with international commissions of inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Declaration on Fact-finding by the United Nations===
On 9 December 1991, the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] of the [[United Nations]] approved the ''[[Declaration on Fact-finding by the United Nations in the Field of the Maintenance of International Peace and Security]]''. The resolution emphasized
&lt;blockquote&gt;
...that the ability of the United Nations to maintain international peace and security depends to a large extent on its acquiring detailed knowledge about the factual circumstances of any dispute or situation.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
and
&lt;blockquote&gt;
to encourage States to bear in mind the role that competent organs of the United Nations can play in ascertaining the facts in relation to disputes or situations.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations. [https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/46/a46r059.htm Declaration on Fact-finding by the United Nations in the Field of the Maintenance of International Peace and Security]. 9 December 1991. Accessed 17 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is also a range of fact-finding procedures in the [[United Nations]] relating to serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law, as well as fact-finding on the crimes of aggression, genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity which is carried out by the [[International Criminal Court]].  Professor [[Lyal S. Sunga]] discusses how UN human rights special procedures fact-finding can help the International Criminal Court find facts and how the two should be made complementary.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lyal S. Sunga]], "How Can UN Human Rights Special Procedures Sharpen ICC Fact-Finding?" 15(2) ''The International Journal of Human Rights'' (2011) 187–204.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Triers of fact==
{{main article|Trier of fact}}

Fact finders often have the job of determining what facts are available and their relevancy.&lt;ref&gt;Schultz, Norman. [http://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/fact-finding/ Fact-Finding]. Accessed 17 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The position of fact finder is determined by the type of proceeding. In a jury trial, it is the role of a jury in a jury trial. In a non-jury trial, the judge sits both as a fact-finder and as the trier of law. In administrative proceedings it may be a hearing officer or a hearing body.&lt;ref name="about" /&gt;

==Characteristics of fact-finding==
According to the United Nations, fact-finding should be comprehensive, [[Journalistic objectivity|objective]], [[impartiality|impartial]] and [[timeliness|timely]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Resolution 46/59 Declaration of fact-finding missions |url=http://undocs.org/A/RES/46/59 |publisher=UN |location =New York |date=9 December 1991 |quote=Fact-finding should be comprehensive, objective, impartial and timely.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Haplogroup A-P305''' also known as '''A1''' is a [[Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup]]. Like its parent haplogroup [[haplogroup A0-T]] (A-L1085), A1 includes the vast majority of living human males. It emerged in [[Africa]] approximately 161,300 years ago. &lt;ref name="yfull"/&gt; By comparison, members of its sole sibling [[subclade]], [[haplogroup A0]] – the only other primary subclade of haplogroup A0-T – are found mostly in  

Basal, undivergent A-P305* is largely restricted to populations native to [[Africa]], though a handful of cases have been reported in [[Europe]] and [[Western Asia]]. A-P305* is found at its highest rates in [[Gyele people|Bakola Pygmies]] (South [[Cameroon]]) at 8.3% and [[Berbers]] from [[Algeria]] at 1.5%&lt;ref name="Cruciani2011"/&gt; and in [[Ghana]].&lt;ref name="Scozzari2012"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Scozzari R, Massaia A, D'Atanasio E, etal |title=Molecular dissection of the basal clades in the human Y chromosome phylogenetic tree |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=7 |issue=11 |pages=e49170 |year=2012 |pmid=23145109 |pmc=3492319 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0049170 |url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0049170}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clade also achieves high frequencies in the [[Bushmen]] [[hunter-gatherer]] populations of [[Southern Africa]], followed closely by many [[Nilotic]] groups in [[Eastern Africa]]. However, haplogroup A's oldest sub-clades are exclusively found in [[Central Africa|Central]]-[[Maghreb|Northwest Africa]], where it, and consequently Y-chromosomal Adam, is believed to have originated about 140,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="Cruciani2011"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cruciani F, Trombetta B, Massaia A, Destro-Bisol G, Sellitto D, Scozzari R | title = A revised root for the human Y chromosomal phylogenetic tree: the origin of patrilineal diversity in Africa | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 88 | issue = 6 | pages = 814–8 | date = Jun 2011 | pmid = 21601174 | pmc = 3113241 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajhg.2011.05.002 | url = http://www.cell.com/AJHG/fulltext/S0002-9297%2811%2900164-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The clade has also been observed at notable frequencies in certain populations in [[Ethiopia]], as well as some [[Pygmy]] groups in Central Africa.

The '''history of science and technology''' ('''HST''') is a field of [[history]] which examines how humanity's understanding of the natural world (science) and ability to manipulate it ([[technology]]) have changed over the centuries.  This academic discipline also studies the cultural, economic, and political impacts of scientific innovation.

[[Historiography of science|Histories of science]] were originally written by practicing and retired scientists, starting primarily with [[William Whewell]], as a way to communicate the virtues of science to the public. In the early 1930s, after a famous paper given by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] historian [[Boris Hessen]], was focused into looking at the ways in which scientific practices were allied with the needs and motivations of their context. After [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]], extensive resources were put into teaching and researching the discipline, with the hopes that it would help the public better understand both Science and Technology as they came to play an exceedingly prominent role in the world. In the 1960s, especially in the wake of the work done by [[Thomas Kuhn]], the discipline began to serve a very different function, and began to be used as a way to critically examine the scientific enterprise. At the present time it is often closely aligned with the field of [[science studies]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Modern engineering as it is understood today took form during the [[scientific revolution]], though much of the mathematics and science was built on the work of the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], [[Mesopotamia]]ns, [[History of science and technology in China|Chinese]], [[Science and technology in ancient India|Indians]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} See the main articles [[History of science]] and [[History of technology]] for these respective topics.

=== United States ===
Academic study of the History of Science as an independent discipline was launched by [[George Sarton]] at Harvard with his book ''Introduction to the History of Science'' (1927) and the [[Isis (journal)|''Isis'' journal]] (founded in 1912).  Sarton exemplified the early 20th century view of the history of science as the history of great men and great ideas. He shared with many of his contemporaries a Whiggish belief in history as a record of the advances and delays in the march of progress. The History of Science was not a recognized subfield of American history in this period, and most of the work was carried out by interested Scientists and Physicians rather than professional Historians.&lt;ref&gt;Nathan Reingold, "History of Science Today, 1. Uniformity as Hidden Diversity: History of Science in the United States, 1920-1940," ''British Journal for the History of Science'' 1986 19(3): 243-262&lt;/ref&gt;  With the work of [[I. Bernard Cohen]] at Harvard, the history of Science became an established subdiscipline of history after 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Dauben | first1= JW | last2= Gleason | first2= ML | last3= Smith | first3= GE | title= Seven decades of history of science: I.

The book was part of a broader trend of interest in holism in European and colonial academia during the early twentieth century.&lt;ref name="OttoBubandt2011"/&gt; Smuts' philosophy of holism was based in the thoughts behind his earlier book ''[[Walt Whitman]]: A Study in the Evolution of Personality'', written during his time in Cambridge.&lt;ref&gt;Jan C Smuts: Walt Whitman – ''a Study in the Evolution of Personality'', Wayne State University Press 1973&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hancock – ''Smuts: 1. The Sanguine Years, 1870–1919'', p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; He described a "process-orientated, hierarchical view of nature" and has been influential among criticisms of [[reductionism]].&lt;ref name=Poynton/&gt; Smuts' formulation of holism has also been linked with his political-military activity, especially his aspiration to create a league of nations.&lt;ref name=Crafford1943&gt;{{cite book

Ni contents in leaves of ''P. douarrei'' vary considerably due to leaf age. Older leaves contain twice as much Ni as younger leaves, and leaf Ni content does not correlate significantly with neither plant size nor soil Ni content. Variations in accumulation differ greatly among branches within individuals as well as between individuals, but this intraplant variability was not strongly correlated with the mean leaf Ni content of an individual shrub. Epiphyll cover is increased on the upper surface of older leaves.

'''Notes'''
* In the genus ''Alyssum'', free histamin (His) is an important Ni binding ligand that increases in the xylem proportionately to root Ni uptake. There is a close correlation between Ni tolerance, root His concentration, and ATP-PRT transcript abundance. Thus ATP-PRT expression may play a major role in regulating the pool of free His and contributes to the exceptional Ni tolerance of hyperaccumulator ''Alyssum'' species. But this is not the complete hyperaccumulator phenotype because His-(GM-)overproducing lines do not exhibit increased Ni concentrations in either xylem sap or shoot tissue.&lt;ref name= "Ingle05"&gt;[http://www.plantcell.org/cgi/content/full/17/7/2089?maxtoshow=&amp;HITS=&amp;hits=&amp;RESULTFORMAT=1&amp;andorexacttitle=and&amp;fulltext=seed%2C+hyperaccumulator&amp;andorexactfulltext=and&amp;searchid=1&amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;sortspec=date&amp;resourcetype=HWCIT]

==Notes==
* '''Uranium''': The symbol for Uranium is sometimes given as Ur instead of U. According to Ulrich Schmidt&lt;ref name="Schmidt03"/&gt; and others, plants' concentration of uranium is considerably increased by an application of [[citric acid]], which solubilizes the uranium (and other metals).
* '''Radionuclides''': Cs-137 and Sr-90 are not removed from the top 0.4 meters of soil even under high rainfall, and migration rate from the top few centimeters of soil is slow.&lt;ref name= "Entry96"&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/h68009j27515440m/] J.A. Entry, N.C. Vance, M.A. Hamilton, D. Zabowski, L.S. Watrud, D.C. Adriano. ''Phytoremediation of soil contaminated with low concentrations of radionuclides.'' Water, Air, and Soil Pollution, 1996. 88: 167-176. Cited in Westhoff99.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Radionuclides''': Plants with mycorrhizal associations are often more effective than non-mycorrhizal plants at the uptake of radionuclides.&lt;ref name= "Entry94"&gt;J.A. Entry, P. T.

Cited in Westhoff99.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Radionuclides''': In general, soils containing higher amounts of organic matter will allow plants to accumulate higher amounts of radionuclides.&lt;ref name= "Entry96"/&gt; See also note on ''Lolium multiflorum'' in Paasikallio 1984.&lt;ref name="Paasikallio84"/&gt; Plant uptake is also increased with a higher cation exchange capacity for Sr-90 availability, and a lower base saturation for uptake of both Sr-90 and Cs-137.&lt;ref name= "Entry96"/&gt;
* '''Radionuclides''': Fertilizing the soil with nitrogen if needed will indirectly increase the take-up of radionuclides by generally boosting the plant's overall growth and more specifically roots' growth. But some fertilizers such as K or Ca compete with the radionuclides for cation exchange sites, and will not increase the take-up of radionuclides.&lt;ref name= "Entry96"/&gt;
* '''Radionuclides''': Zhu and Smolders, lab test:&lt;ref name="Zhu00"&gt;[http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/51/351/1635] Y-G. Zhu and E. Smolders, ''Plant uptake of radiocaesium: a review of mechanisms, regulation and application.'' Journal of Experimental Botany, Vol. 51, No. 351, pp. 1635-1645, October 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Cs uptake is mostly influenced by K supply. The uptake of radiocaesium depends mainly on two transport pathways on plant root cell membranes: the K+ transporter and the K+ channel pathway. Cs is likely transported by the K+ transport system. When external concentration of K is limited to low levels, le K+ transporter shows little discrimination against Cs+; if K supply is high, the K+ channel is dominant and shows high discrimination against Cs+. Caesium is very mobile within the plant, but the ratio Cs/K is not uniform within the plant. Phytoremediation as a possible option for the decontamination of caesium-contaminated soils is limited mainly by that it takes tens of years and creates large volumes of waste.

Broadley and N.J. Willey. ''Differences in root uptake of radiocaesium by 30 plant taxa''. Environmental Pollution 1997, Volume 97, Issues 1-2, Pages 11-15&lt;/ref&gt; find that across 30 taxa studied, ''Gramineae'' and ''Chenopodiaceae'' show the strongest correlation between Rb (K) and Cs concentration. The fast-growing ''Chenopodiaceae'' discriminate approx. 9 times less between Rb and Cs than the slow-growing''Gramineae'', and this correlate with highest and lowest concentrations achieved respectively.
* '''Caesium''': In Chernobyl-derived radioactivity, the amount of contamination is dependent on the roughness of bark, absolute bark surface and the existence of leaves during the deposition. The major contamination of the shoots is from direct deposition on the trees.&lt;ref name="EZ91"/&gt;

'''Ideation''' is the [[creativity|creative]] process of generating, developing, and communicating new ideas, where an [[idea]] is understood as a basic element of thought that can be either visual, concrete, or abstract.&lt;ref&gt;Jonson, 2005, page 613&lt;/ref&gt; Ideation comprises all stages of a thought cycle, from [[innovation]], to development, to actualization.&lt;ref&gt;Graham and Bachmann, 2004, pg 54&lt;/ref&gt;  Ideation can be conducted by individuals, organizations, or crowds. As such, it is an essential part of the [[design process]], both in education and practice.&lt;ref&gt;Broadbent, in Fowles, 1979, page 15&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Methods of innovation==

The book ''Ideation: The Birth and Death of Ideas'' (Graham and Bachmann, 2004) proposes the following methods of innovation:

;Problem solution:  This is the most simple method of progress, where someone has found a problem and as a result, solves it.
;Derivative idea:  This involves taking something that already exists and changing it.
;Symbiotic idea:  A symbiotic method of idea creation is when multiple ideas are combined, using different elements of each to make a whole.
;Revolutionary idea:  A revolutionary idea breaks away from traditional thought and creates a brand new perspective.  For example, the writings of [[Copernicus]] (a development of classical Greek thought).
;Serendipitous discovery:  [[Serendipitous]] solutions are ideas which have been coincidentally developed without the intention of the inventor. For example, the discovery of [[penicillin]].
;Targeted innovation:  Creating a targeted innovation deals with a direct path of discovery.  This is often accompanied by intensive research in order to have a distinct and almost expected resolution.  For example, [[linear programming]].
;Artistic innovation:  Artistic innovation disregards the necessity for practicality and holds no constraints.
;Philosophical idea:  The philosophical idea lives in the mind of the creator and can never  be proven. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=isbn:0471479446|title= Ideation: The Birth and Death of Ideas|accessdate=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This type of idea however can still have vast residual effects.  For example, the idea of [[eternal recurrence]].
;Computer-assisted discovery:  This uses a computer in order to widen possibilities of research and numeric possibilities.

This list of methods is by no means comprehensive or necessarily accurate. Graham and Bachmann's examples of revolutionary ideas might better be described as evolutionary; both Marx and Copernicus having built upon pre-existing concepts within new or different contexts.  Similarly, the description provided for artistic innovation represents one perspective.

More-nuanced understandings, such as that expressed by [[Stephen Nachmanovitch]] in ''Free Play: Improvisation in Life and Art'', recognize the generative force technical and perceptual limitations provide within specific arts practices.{{Page needed|date=November 2014}}  In [[painting]], for example, technical limitations such as the frame, the surface and the palette, along with perceptual constraints like [[Figure–ground (perception)|figure/ground relationships]] and [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], provide creative frameworks for the painter.  Similarly in music, harmonic scales, meter and time signatures work in tandem with choices of instrumentation and expression to both produce specific results and improvise novel outcomes.

The [[T.O.T.E.|T.O.T.E. model]], an [[iterative]] [[problem solving]] strategy based on [[feedback]] loops, provides an alternative approach to considering the process of ideation.  Ideation may also be considered as a facet of other generative systems, such as [[Emergence]].

==Criticism==

The word "ideation" has come under informal criticism as being a term of meaningless jargon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hbr.org/2008/08/why-jargon-feeds-on-lazy-minds.html|title=Why Jargon Feeds on Lazy Minds|last=Berkun|first=Scott|work=[[Harvard Business Review]]|accessdate=16 March 2016|date=2008-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as being inappropriately similar to the [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] term for [[suicidal ideation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.themuse.com/advice/10-annoying-buzzwords-the-whole-office-would-be-better-off-without|title=Annoying Tech Jargon to Remove From Your Vocabulary-The Muse|last=Thomson|first=Stephanie|publisher=[[The Daily Muse|The Muse]]|accessdate=16 March 2016|date=2015-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[medicine]], a '''laboratory specimen''' is a [[biological specimen]] taken by [[sample (medicine)|sampling]], that is, gathered matter of a medical patient's tissue, fluid, or other material derived from the patient used for laboratory analysis to assist [[differential diagnosis]] or staging of a [[disease]] process. Common examples include [[throat]] swabs, [[sputum]], [[urine]], [[blood]], [[surgical drain]] fluids, and [[tissue biopsies]].

'''''Lexicon Technicum:  or, {{Not a typo|An}} Universal English Dictionary of Arts and Sciences:  Explaining not only the Terms of Art, but the Arts Themselves''''' was in many respects the first alphabetical [[encyclopedia]] written in English.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Collison]], ''Encyclopaedias: Their History throughout the Ages'' (New York: Hafner, 1966), p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the emphasis of the ''Lexicon Technicum'' was on [[mathematical]] subjects, its contents go beyond what would be called [[science]] or [[technology]] today, in conformity with the broad [[eighteenth-century]] understanding of the terms "[[arts]]" and "science," and it includes entries on the [[humanities]] and [[fine arts]], notably on [[law]], [[commerce]], [[music]], and [[heraldry]]. However, the ''Lexicon Technicum'' neglects [[theology]], [[ancient history|antiquity]], [[biography]], and [[poetry]]. [[File:1708-harris-ttlpg.jpg|thumb|Harris' ''Lexicon Technicum'', title page of 2nd edition of the first volume, 1708]]

== Overview ==
The ''Lexicon Technicum'' was the work of a London clergyman, [[John Harris (writer)|John Harris]] (1666-1719). Its professed advantage over [[French language|French]] dictionaries of the arts and sciences was that it contained explanation not only of the terms used in the arts and sciences, but also of the arts and sciences themselves. Harris issued a three-page proposal for this work in 1702, and the first edition of the first volume was published in London in 1704. The first volume contains 1220 pages, 4 plates, and many additional diagrams and figures within the text. Like many early English encyclopedias, the pages are not [[Page numbering|numbered]]; numbering may have been thought unnecessary as readers could search by its [[alphabetical]] arrangement.

Volume 2, which was also alphabetized from A through Z, was first published in 1710. The second volume contains 1419 pages and 4 plates, with a list of about 1300 subscribers. A previously unpublished treatise on [[acids]] by [[Sir Isaac Newton]] was included in its original [[Latin]]&lt;ref&gt;"De Natura acidorum" (1692)&lt;/ref&gt; along with Harris's English translation,&lt;ref&gt;"Some Thoughts about the Nature of Acids; by Sir Isaac Newton"&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps without the latter's permission or encouragement.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lael Bradshaw|Lael Ely Bradshaw]], “John Harris’s ''Lexicon Technicum'',” in ''Notable Encyclopedias of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries: Nine Predecessors of the Encyclopédie'', ed. [[Frank Kafker|Frank A. Kafker]] ([[Oxford]]: [[Voltaire Foundation]], 1981), p.110.&lt;/ref&gt; A large part of the volume consists of mathematical and [[astronomical]] tables, since Harris intended his work to serve as a small mathematical library. He provided tables of [[logarithms]], [[sines]], [[tangents]], and [[secant (trigonometry)|secants]], a two-page list of books, and an index of the articles in both volumes under 26 heads, filling 50 pages. The longest lists are for law (1700 articles), [[surgery]], [[anatomy]], [[geometry]], [[fortification]], [[botany]], and music.

In his preface, Harris stated that he got less help from previous dictionaries than one would expect. While acknowledging some borrowing, Harris insisted that "much the greater part of what [the reader] will find here is collected from no Dictionaries, but from the best Original Authors I could procure." Harris's preface touted his coverage of mathematical subjects. He admitted the imperfection of his data on [[stars]], noting that [[Flamsteed]] had refused to assist him, but he vaunted his coverage of astronomy, especially his full coverage of Newton's theories of the [[moon]] and of [[comets]]. In botany he claimed to have given "a pretty exact botanick lexicon, which was what we really wanted before," using [[John Ray|Dr John Ray]]'s method. To describe the parts of a [[ship]] accurately, he supposedly "often" went on board himself. In law, he wrote, he abridged from the best writers and had the result "carefully examined and corrected by a Gentleman of known Ability in that Profession."

The specified aims of the book did not prevent Harris from including some highly opinionated asides, for example this definition conveying the poor view he took of [[lawyers]]:  "Sollicitor, is a Man imploy'd to take care of, and follow Suits depending in Courts of Law, or Equity, formerly allowed only to Nobility, whose Menial Servants they were; but now too frequently used by others, to the damage of the People, and the increase of [[Champerty and maintenance|Champerty and Maintenance]]".

Harris wrote that he had wished to supply an index for each art and science as well as more plates on anatomy and ships, but the underwriters could not afford it, "the Book having swelled so very much beyond the Expectation."

A review of this work, extending to the unusual length of four pages, appeared in the ''[[Philosophical Transactions]]'' for 1704.

The ''Lexicon Technicum'' was long very popular, enduring through at least 1744 as the main rival of [[Ephraim Chambers]]'s ''[[Cyclopædia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]''. The final publication of the two volumes of the ''Lexicum Technicum'' was in 1736. An anonymous one-volume supplement did appear in 1744, with 996 pages and 6 plates, but this work was allegedly "not well received," being perceived by contemporaries as a mere "booksellers speculation."&lt;ref&gt;"Encyclopaedia," in ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', 13th edition, vol. 19, p. 373.&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, no new editions of the ''Lexicon Technicum'' were published thereafter.

==Publication History==
Unlike most multi-volume works, the several editions of volumes 1 and 2 were not synchronized until 1736. The first volume appeared in five editions, while the second volume appeared only in three editions. The first edition of volume 1 appeared in 1704; the second edition in 1708, the third edition in 1716, and the fourth edition in 1725. In contrast, the first edition of volume 2 appeared in 1710, and the second edition did not appear until 1723. The two volumes were not published together until 1736, constituting the fifth edition of the first volume and the third edition of the second volume. The supplement of 1744 was billed as volume 3.

We do not know the names of the editors who carried on Harris's work after his death in 1719.

'''Mechanism''' is the belief that natural wholes (principally living things) are like complicated machines or artifacts, composed of parts lacking any intrinsic relationship to each other. Thus, the source of an apparent thing's activities is not the whole itself, but its parts or an external influence on the parts.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

The doctrine of mechanism in [[philosophy]] comes in two different flavors. They are both doctrines of [[metaphysics]], but they are different in scope and ambitions: the first is a global doctrine about nature; the second is a local doctrine about humans and their minds, which is hotly contested. For clarity, we might distinguish these two doctrines as [[universal mechanism]] and [[anthropic mechanism]].

{{quote|There is no constant meaning in the history of philosophy for the word Mechanism. Originally, the term meant that cosmological theory which ascribes the motion and changes of the world to some external force. In this view material things are purely passive, while according to the opposite theory (i. e., Dynamism), they possess certain internal sources of energy which account for the activity of each and for its influence on the course of events; These meanings, however, soon underwent modification. The question as to whether motion is an inherent property of bodies, or has been communicated to them by some external agency, was very often ignored. With a large number of cosmologists the essential feature of Mechanism is the attempt to reduce all the qualities and activities of bodies to quantitative realities, i. e. to mass and motion. But a further modification soon followed. Living bodies, as is well known, present at first sight certain characteristic properties which have no counterpart in lifeless matter. Mechanism aims to go beyond these appearances. It seeks to explain all "vital" phenomena as physical and chemical facts; whether or not these facts are in turn reducible to mass and motion becomes a secondary question, although Mechanists are generally inclined to favour such reduction. The theory opposed to this biological mechanism is no longer Dynamism, but Vitalism or Neo-vitalism, which maintains that vital activities cannot be explained, and never will be explained, by the laws which govern lifeless matter.&lt;ref name="CE1913"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Mechanism |encyclopedia=Catholic Encyclopedia |date=1913 |url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia_(1913)/Mechanism}}&lt;/ref&gt;|"Mechanism" in ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (1913)}}

== Universal mechanism&lt;!--'Universal mechanism' redirects here--&gt; ==

The older doctrine, here called '''universal mechanism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, is the ancient philosophies closely linked with [[materialism]] and [[reductionism]], especially that of the [[atomism|atomists]] and to a large extent, [[stoicism|stoic physics]]. They held that the universe is reducible to completely mechanical principles—that is, the [[motion (physics)|motion]] and collision of [[matter]]. Later mechanists believed the achievements of the [[scientific revolution]] had shown that all phenomena could eventually be explained in terms of 'mechanical' laws, natural laws governing the motion and collision of matter that implied a thorough going [[determinism]]: if ''all'' phenomena could be explained ''entirely'' through the motion of matter under the laws of [[classical physics]], then even more surely than the gears of a clock determine that it must strike 2:00 an hour after striking 1:00, ''all'' phenomena must be completely determined: whether past, present or future. (One of the philosophical implications of modern [[quantum mechanics]] is that this view of determinism is not defensible.)

The French mechanist and determinist [[Pierre Simon de Laplace]] formulated the sweeping implications of this thesis by saying:

{{quote|We may regard the present state of the universe as the effect of the past and the cause of the future. An intellect which at any given moment knew all of the forces that animate nature and the mutual positions of the beings that compose it, if this intellect were vast enough to submit the data to analysis, could condense into a single formula the movement of the greatest bodies of the universe and that of the lightest [[atom]]; for such an intellect nothing could be uncertain and the future just like the past would be present before its eyes.|Pierre Simon Laplace|''A Philosophical Essay on Probabilities''}}

One of the first and most famous expositions of universal mechanism is found in the opening passages of ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' by [[Thomas Hobbes]] (1651). What is less frequently appreciated is that [[René Descartes]] was a staunch mechanist, though today, in the [[philosophy of mind]], he is remembered for introducing the [[mind–body problem]] in terms of [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]] and [[physicalism]].

Descartes was a [[substance dualist]], and argued that reality was composed of two radically different types of substance: extended [[matter]], on the one hand, and immaterial [[mind]], on the other. Descartes argued that one cannot explain the conscious mind in terms of the spatial dynamics of mechanistic bits of matter cannoning off each other. Nevertheless, his understanding of biology was thoroughly mechanistic in nature:

:"I should like you to consider that these functions (including passion, memory, and imagination) follow from the mere arrangement of the machine’s organs every bit as naturally as the movements of a clock or other automaton follow from the arrangement of its counter-weights and wheels." (Descartes, Treatise on Man, p.108)

His scientific work was based on the traditional mechanistic understanding that animals and humans are completely mechanistic [[automaton|automata]]. Descartes' dualism was motivated by the seeming impossibility that mechanical dynamics could yield mental experiences.

[[Isaac Newton]] ushered in a much weaker acceptation of mechanism that tolerated the antithetical, and as yet inexplicable, [[action at a distance]] of [[gravity]]. However, his work seemed to successfully predict the motion of both celestial and terrestrial bodies according to that principle, and the generation of philosophers who were inspired by Newton's example carried the mechanist banner nonetheless. Chief among them were French [[philosophy|philosophers]] such as [[Julien Offray de La Mettrie]] and [[Denis Diderot]] (see also: [[French materialism]]).

== Anthropic mechanism&lt;!--'Anthropic mechanism' redirects here--&gt; ==

The thesis in '''anthropic mechanism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is not that everything can be completely explained in mechanical terms (although some anthropic mechanists may ''also'' believe that), but rather that everything ''about human beings'' can be completely explained in mechanical terms, as surely as can everything about clocks or the internal combustion engine.

One of the chief obstacles that all mechanistic theories have faced is providing a mechanistic explanation of the human [[mind]]; Descartes, for one, endorsed [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] in spite of endorsing a completely mechanistic conception of the material world because he argued that mechanism and the notion of a mind were logically incompatible. Hobbes, on the other hand, conceived of the mind and the will as purely mechanistic, completely explicable in terms of the effects of perception and the pursuit of desire, which in turn he held to be completely explicable in terms of the materialistic operations of the nervous system. Following Hobbes, other mechanists argued for a thoroughly mechanistic explanation of the mind, with one of the most influential and controversial expositions of the doctrine being offered by [[Julien Offray de La Mettrie]] in his ''Man a Machine'' (1748).

Today, as in the past, the main points of debate between anthropic mechanists and anti-mechanists are mainly occupied with two topics: the mind — and consciousness, in particular — and [[free will]]. Anti-mechanists argue that anthropic mechanism is incompatible with our commonsense intuitions: in [[philosophy of mind]] they argue that unconscious matter cannot completely explain the phenomenon of consciousness, and in [[metaphysics]] they argue that anthropic mechanism implies determinism about human action, which (they argue) is incompatible with our understanding of ourselves as creatures with [[free will]]. Contemporary philosophers who have argued for this position include [[Norman Malcolm]] and
[[David Chalmers]].

Anthropic mechanists typically respond in one of two ways. In the first, they agree with anti-mechanists that mechanism conflicts with some of our commonsense intuitions, but go on to argue that our commonsense intuitions are simply mistaken and need to be revised. Down this path lies [[eliminative materialism]] in [[philosophy of mind]], and [[hard determinism]] on the question of free will. This option is accepted by the eliminative materialist philosopher [[Paul Churchland]]. Some have questioned how eliminative materialism is compatible with the freedom of will apparently required for anyone (including its adherents) to make truth claims.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Jonas, ''The Phenomenon of Life: Toward a Philosophical Biology'' (Evanston, Illinois: Northwestern University Press, 2001/1966), p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; The second option, common amongst philosophers who adopt anthropic mechanism, is to argue that the [[argument]]s given for incompatibility are specious: whatever it is we mean by "consciousness" and "free will," they urge, it is fully compatible with a mechanistic understanding of the human mind and will. As a result, they tend to argue for one or another non-eliminativist [[Physicalism|physicalist]] theories of mind, and for [[compatibilism]] on the question of free will. Contemporary philosophers who have argued for this sort of account include [[J. J. C. Smart]] and [[Daniel Dennett]].

===Gödelian arguments&lt;!--'Gödelian argument' and 'Gödelian arguments' redirect here--&gt;===
Some scholars have debated over what, if anything, [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] imply about anthropic mechanism. Much of the debate centers on whether the human mind is equivalent to a [[Turing machine]], or by the [[Church-Turing thesis]], any finite machine at all. If it is, and if the machine is [[Consistency|consistent]], then Gödel's incompleteness theorems would apply to it.

'''Gödelian arguments'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; claim that a system of human mathematicians (or some idealization of human mathematicians) is both consistent and powerful enough to recognize its own consistency. Since this is impossible for a Turing machine, the Gödelian concludes that human reasoning must be non-mechanical.

However, the modern consensus in the scientific and mathematical community is that actual human reasoning is inconsistent; that any consistent "idealized version" ''H'' of human reasoning would logically be forced to adopt a healthy but counter-intuitive open-minded skepticism about the consistency of ''H'' (otherwise ''H'' is provably inconsistent); and that Gödel's theorems do not lead to any valid argument against mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[Graham Oppy]]|title=Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goedel-incompleteness/#GdeArgAgaMec|website=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|accessdate=27 April 2016|date=20 January 2015|quote=These Gödelian anti-mechanist arguments are, however, problematic, and there is wide consensus that they fail.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Stuart J. Russell]]|author2=[[Peter Norvig]]|title=[[Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach]]|date=2010|publisher=[[Prentice Hall]]|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|isbn=0-13-604259-7|edition=3rd|chapter=26.1.2: Philosophical Foundations/Weak AI: Can Machines Act Intelligently?/The mathematical objection|quote=...even if we grant that computers have limitations on what they can prove, there is no evidence that humans are immune from those limitations.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Colyvan. An introduction to the philosophy of mathematics. [[Cambridge University Press]], 2012. From 2.2.2, 'Philosophical significance of Gödel's incompleteness results': "The accepted wisdom (with which I concur) is that the Lucas-Penrose arguments fail."&lt;/ref&gt; This consensus that Gödelian anti-mechanist arguments are doomed to failure is laid out strongly in ''[[Artificial Intelligence (journal)|Artificial Intelligence]]'': "''any'' attempt to utilize (Gödel's incompleteness results) to attack the [[computationalism|computationalist]] thesis is bound to be illegitimate, since these results are quite consistent with the computationalist thesis."&lt;ref name=laforte&gt;LaForte, G., Hayes, P. J., Ford, K. M. 1998. Why Gödel's theorem cannot refute computationalism. [[Artificial Intelligence (journal)|Artificial Intelligence]], 104:265-286, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

====History====
One of the earliest attempts to use incompleteness to reason about human intelligence was by Gödel himself in his 1951 [[Josiah Willard Gibbs Lectureship|Gibbs Lecture]] entitled "Some basic theorems on the foundations of mathematics and their philosophical implications".&lt;ref&gt;[[Kurt Gödel|Gödel, Kurt]], 1951, ''Some basic theorems on the foundations of mathematics and their implications'' in  [[Solomon Feferman]], ed., 1995. ''Collected works / Kurt Gödel, Vol. III''. Oxford University Press: 304-23.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this lecture, Gödel uses the incompleteness theorem to arrive at the following disjunction: (a) the human mind is not a consistent finite machine, or (b) there exist [[Diophantine equations]] for which it cannot decide whether solutions exist. Gödel finds (b) implausible, and thus seems to have believed the human mind was not equivalent to a finite machine, i.e., its power exceeded that of any finite machine. He recognized that this was only a conjecture, since one could never disprove (b). Yet he considered the disjunctive conclusion to be a "certain fact".

In subsequent years, more direct anti-mechanist lines of reasoning were apparently floating around the intellectual atmosphere. In 1960, [[Hilary Putnam]] published a paper entitled "Minds and Machines," in which he points out the flaws of a typical anti-mechanist argument.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hilary Putnam|Putnam, Hilary]], 1960, ''Minds and Machines'' in [[Sidney Hook]], ed., ''Dimensions of Mind: A Symposium''. New York University Press. Reprinted in Anderson, A. R., ed., 1964. ''Minds and Machines''. Prentice-Hall: 77.&lt;/ref&gt;  Informally, this is the argument that the (alleged) difference between "what can be mechanically proven" and "what can be seen to be true by humans" shows that human intelligence is not mechanical in nature. Or, as Putnam puts it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Let T be a Turing machine which "represents" me in the sense that T can prove just the mathematical statements I prove. Then using Gödel's technique I can discover a proposition that T cannot prove, and moreover I can prove this proposition. This refutes the assumption that T "represents" me, hence I am not a Turing machine.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Hilary Putnam]] objects that this argument ignores the issue of consistency. Gödel's technique can only be applied to consistent systems. It is conceivable, argues Putnam, that the human mind is inconsistent. If one is to use Gödel's technique to prove the proposition that T cannot prove, one must first prove (the mathematical statement representing) the consistency of T, a daunting and perhaps impossible task. Later Putnam suggested that while Gödel's theorems cannot be applied to humans, since they make mistakes and are therefore inconsistent, it may be applied to the human faculty of science or mathematics in general. If we are to believe that it is consistent, then either we cannot prove its consistency, or it cannot be represented by a Turing machine.&lt;ref&gt;The Gödel Theorem and Human Nature, a talk given by [[Hilary Putnam]] in the Gödel centenary 2006  [http://www.logic.at/goedel2006/abstract.php?putnam]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J. R. Lucas]] in ''[[Minds, Machines and Gödel]]'' (1961), and later in his book ''The Freedom of the Will'' (1970), lays out an anti-mechanist argument closely following the one described by Putnam, including reasons for why the human mind can be considered consistent.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Lucas (philosopher)|Lucas, J. R.]], 1961, "[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~jrlucas/Godel/mmg.html Minds, Machines, and Gödel.]" ''Philosophy 36'':112-27.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lucas admits that, by Gödel's second theorem, a human mind cannot formally prove its own consistency, and even says (perhaps facetiously) that women and politicians are inconsistent. Nevertheless, he sets out arguments for why a male non-politician can be considered consistent. These arguments are philosophical in nature and are the subject of much debate; Lucas provides references to responses on his own [http://users.ox.ac.uk/~jrlucas/Godel/referenc.html website].

Another work was done by [[Judson Webb]] in his 1968 paper "Metamathematics and the Philosophy of Mind".&lt;ref&gt;[[Judson Webb|Webb, Judson]], 1968, "Metamathematics and the Philosophy of Mind," ''Philosophy of Science 35'': 156-78.&lt;/ref&gt;  Webb claims that previous attempts have glossed over whether one truly can see that the Gödelian statement ''p'' pertaining to oneself, is true. Using a different formulation of Gödel's theorems, namely, that of [[Raymond Smullyan]] and [[Emil Post]], Webb shows one can derive convincing arguments for oneself of both the truth and falsity of ''p''. He furthermore argues that all arguments about the philosophical implications of Gödel's theorems are really arguments about whether the [[Church-Turing thesis]] is true.

Later, [[Roger Penrose]] entered the fray, providing somewhat novel anti-mechanist arguments in his books, ''[[The Emperor's New Mind]]''  (1989) [ENM] and ''[[Shadows of the Mind]]'' (1994) [SM]. These books have proved highly controversial.  [[Martin Davis]] responded to ENM in his paper [http://www.cs.nyu.edu/cs/faculty/davism/penrose.ps "Is Mathematical Insight Algorithmic?" (ps)], where he argues that Penrose ignores the issue of consistency.  [[Solomon Feferman]] gives a critical examination of SM in his paper [http://math.stanford.edu/~feferman/papers/penrose.pdf "Penrose's Gödelian argument" (pdf)].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The response of the scientific community to Penrose's arguments has been negative, with one group of scholars calling Penrose's repeated attempts to form a persuasive Gödelian argument "a kind of intellectual shell game, in which a precisely defined notion to which a mathematical result applies... is switched for a vaguer notion".&lt;ref name=laforte /&gt;

A Gödel-based anti-mechanism argument can be found in [[Douglas Hofstadter]]'s book ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid]]'', though Hofstadter is widely viewed as a known skeptic of such arguments:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Looked at this way, Gödel's proof suggests – though by no means does it prove! – that there could be some high-level way of viewing the mind/brain, involving concepts which do not appear on lower levels, and that this level might have explanatory power that does not exist – not even in principle – on lower levels. It would mean that some facts could be explained on the high level quite easily, but not on  lower levels at all. No matter how long and cumbersome a low-level statement were made, it would not explain the phenomena in question.
It is analogous to the fact that, if you make derivation after derivation in [[Peano arithmetic]], no matter how long and cumbersome you make them, you will never come up with one for G – despite the fact that on a higher level, you can see that the [[Gödel sentence]] is true.

What might such high-level concepts be? It has been proposed for eons, by various holistically or "soulistically" inclined scientists and humanists that consciousness is a phenomenon that escapes explanation in terms of brain components; so here is a candidate at least. There is also the ever-puzzling notion of free will. So perhaps these qualities could be "emergent" in the sense of requiring explanations which cannot be furnished by the physiology alone
  (''Gödel, Escher, Bach'', p. 708).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rationology.net/eGodel.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nano spray dryers''' refer to using [[spray drying]] to create particles in the nanometer range.  Spray drying is a gentle method for producing [[Powder (substance)|powder]]s with a defined particle size out of solutions, dispersions, and emulsions which is widely used for pharmaceuticals, food, biotechnology, and other industrial materials synthesis. 

In the past, the limitations of spray drying were the particle size (minimum 2 [[micrometre]]s), the yield (maximum around 70%), and the sample volume (minimum 50 ml for devices in lab scale).  Recently, minimum particle sizes have been reduced to 300 [[nanometer|nm]], yields up to 90% are possible, and the sample amount can be as small as 1 ml. These expanded limits are possible due to new technological developments to the spray head, the heating system, and the electrostatic particle collector. To emphasize the small particle sizes possible with this new technology, it has been described as "nano" spray drying.  However, the smallest particles produced are in the sub-micrometre range common to [[Particulate|fine particle]]s rather than the nanometer scale of [[ultrafine particles]].
[[File:functional principle nano 01.jpg|thumb|200px|Functional principle of a nano spray dryer]]

== Functional principle ==
The functional principle is basically the same as with normal spray dryers. There are just different technologies that are used to do similar things.

The drying gas enters the system via the heater. A new kind of heater system allows for [[Laminar flow|laminar air flow]]. The spray head sprays the fine droplets with a narrow size distribution into the drying chamber. The droplets dry and become solid particles. The solid particles are separated in the electrostatic particle collector. The [[exhaust gas]] is filtered and sent to a fume hood or the environment. The inlet temperature is controlled by a temperature sensor.

== Applications ==

[[File:Grisofulvin particles.jpg|thumb|Scanning electron micrograph of grisofulvin particles spray dried with a nano spray dryer]]

'''Pharmaceuticals''':
This technique is widely used in the [[Pharmaceutical industry|pharma]] market. Because of the small sample amounts and the high yields it is ideal for spray drying expensive substances in basic research. The following list shows examples of what is possible:

*[[Inhalation|Inhalable]] drugs for dry powder [[inhaler]]s (DPI‘s)
*Nano- and [[microencapsulation]] of [[liposome]]s
*Stabilization of heat-sensitive [[vaccine]]s, [[insulin]], growth hormones
*[[Micro-encapsulation|Encapsulation]] of [[nanoparticle]] [[drug]]s for high [[bioavailability]]
*Nanocapsules of [[biodegradable polymers]] ([[lactides]], [[glycolide]]s)
*Porous drug carriers for nanoparticle suspensions
*[[Excipients]] for controlled drug release studies: [[trehalose]], [[mannitol]], [[lactose]], [[HPMC]], [[Polyvinyl alcohol|PVA]], [[chitosan]], [[dextrine]], [[PLGA]], [[starch]], [[gelatin]]

'''Materials science''':
This new technique offers new prospects in [[materials science]], specially in the [[nanomaterial]] field. Now it is possible to spray dry fine particles. The following list shows examples of what is possible:
*Fine metal particles for novel [[catalyst]]s
*Fine [[magnetic]] powders
*[[Carbon nanotube]]s as additives
*High performance [[ceramic]]s with novel structures and high specific surface area
*[[Titanium oxide]] particles
*Nanoparticle suspensions for [[Flocculation|agglomeration]]
*[[Silicon oxide]] nanoparticle agglomerates
*Finest [[pigment]]s for [[paint]]s and [[coating]]s

'''Food''':
Also in the field of [[food science]] this technology offers new possibilities. Especially in the currently vibrant field of [[functional food]], the following list shows examples of what is possible:
*Nano food – Functional [[Food additive|additives]]
*Encapsulation of fruit [[aroma]]s, [[flavour]]s, or [[perfume]]s
*Spray drying of fine powder aromas for pet food
*Encapsulation of fish oil for smell protection
*[[Vitamins]], other food additives, etc.

== Spray head ==
One of the three new technologies that makes "nano" spray drying possible is the spray head. 
A piezoelectric system precisely vibrates a fine [[mesh]]. Vibration produces fine droplets with a narrow [[Particle size distribution|size distribution]].

[[File:Mesh vibration.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Vibrating mesh of a nano spray dryer spray head]]
[[File:Droplet size distribution 01.jpg|left|thumb|335px|Size distribution of the droplets produced by the spray head]]
{{clear}}

== Heating system ==
In the field of "nano" spray drying a new heating system is used to provide the drying gas to produce the particles. The gas flow in the system is laminar and not turbulent as in common spray drying. The advantage of a laminar flow is that the particles fall straight down from the spray head and do not stick to the glass wall.

The laminar flow is produced by pressing the air through a porous [[metal foam]].

== Electrostatic particle collector ==
To collect the very fine particles a new technology is used in the field of "nano" spray drying. The reason is that common cyclone technology depends on the particle mass; particles smaller than 2 μm can’t be separated and instead exit the system along with the exhaust gas.

The electrostatic particle collector charges the dry particles' surface and deflects them with an electrical field. To produce the electrical field, a high voltage (16 kV) is applied to a round collector tube. The electrical field builds up between the inner wall of the collector tube and the tips of a grounded star electrode. To have a low level of energy in the system the current is very low.

After getting deflected the particles stay at the inner wall of the particle collector tube and are completely uncharged. This separation method works fine for all kinds of materials.

The efficiency of the electrostatic particle collector is very high: 99% of all particles that enter the system are collected.

==Nanotechnology in Schools==
In recent years, there has been a growing interest in introducing nanoscience and nanotechnology in grade schools, especially at the [[high school]] level. 
In the [[United States]], although very few high schools officially offer a two-semester course in nanotechnology, “nano” concepts are bootstrapped and taught during traditional science classes using a number of educational resources and hands-on activities developed by dedicated non-profit organizations, such as:

* The [[National Science Teachers Association|National Science Teacher Association]], which has published a number of textbooks for nanotechnology in K-12 education, including a teacher’s guide and an activity manual for hands-on experiences. 
* [http://www.nano-link.org Nano-Link], a notable program of the [[Dakota County Technical College]], which has developed a variety of nanotech-related hands-on activities supported by toolkits to teach concepts in nanotechnology throughout direct lab experience.
* [http://www.omninano.org Omni Nano], which is developing comprehensive educational resources specifically designed to support a two-semester high school course, both online and in classrooms. Omni Nano also discusses issues in nanotechnology education on its dedicated blog.
* [http://www.nano4me.org/ Nano4Me], which has a good amount of resources for K-12 education, although their program is intended for higher education. Their K-12 resources include introductory level modules and activities, interactive multimedia, and a collection of experiments and hands-on activities. 
* [[Nanoscale Informal Science Education Network|Nanoscale Informal Science Education Network (NISE)]], which has a website of educational products designed to engage the public in nano science, engineering, and technology. NISE also organizes Nano Days, a nationwide festival of educational programs about nanoscale science and engineering and its potential impact on the future.

In Egypt, [https://web.archive.org/web/20090107041954/http://www.in2nano.sabrycorp.com/ in2nano] is a high school outreach program aiming to increase [[scientific literacy]] and prepare students for the sweeping changes of nanotechnology.

==Nanotechnology education outside of school==
* [[Nanoscale Informal Science Education Network|Nanoscale Informal Science Education Network (NISE)]] has a website of educational products designed to engage the public in nano science, engineering, and technology available at [http://www.nisenet.org www.nisenet.org] and a site for the public at [http://www.whatisnano.org www.whatisnano.org]. The NISE Network also organizes [[Nanoscale Informal Science Education Network#NanoDays|Nano Days]], a nationwide festival of educational programs about nanoscale science and engineering and its potential impact on the future.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6218">'''Open peer review''' is a process in which names of [[peer review]]ers of papers submitted to [[academic journal]]s are disclosed to the authors of the papers in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Walsh E, Rooney M, Appleby L, Wilkinson G | title = Open peer review: a randomised controlled trial | journal = The British Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 176 | issue = 1 | pages = 47–51 | date = January 2000 | pmid = 10789326 | doi = 10.1192/bjp.176.1.47 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vanrooyen&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van Rooyen S, Godlee F, Evans S, Black N, Smith R | title = Effect of open peer review on quality of reviews and on reviewers' recommendations: a randomised trial | journal = BMJ | volume = 318 | issue = 7175 | pages = 23–7 | date = January 1999 | pmid = 9872878 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.318.7175.23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, as with the ''[[BMJ]]'' and [[BioMed Central]], the process also involves posting the entire pre-publication history of the article online, including not only signed reviews of the article, but also its previous versions and author responses to the reviewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/authors/authorfaq/medical | title=What is 'open peer review', as operated by the medical journals in the BMC series? | publisher=BioMed Central | accessdate=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Groves T, Loder E | title = Prepublication histories and open peer review at the BMJ | journal = BMJ | volume = 349 | issue = sep03 13 | pages = g5394 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 25186622 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.g5394 | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
There is no single definition of open peer review, as it is implemented differently by different academic journals, but it has been broadly defined as "any scholarly review mechanism providing disclosure of author and referee identities to one another at any point during the peer review or publication process".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ford E | title = Open peer review at four STEM journals: an observational overview | journal = F1000Research | volume = 4 | pages = 6 | date = 2015-07-20 | pmid = 25767695 | pmc = 4350441 | doi = 10.12688/f1000research.6005.2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==
Possible advantages to an open peer-review system include reviewers being "more tactful and constructive" than they would be if they could remain anonymous.&lt;ref name=nature&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =  | title = Pros and cons of open peer review | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = 197–8 | date = March 1999 | pmid = 10195206 | doi = 10.1038/nature04991 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been argued that open review leads to more honest reviewing and prevents reviewers from following their individual agendas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.elsevier.com/reviewers/what-is-peer-review | title=What is peer review? | publisher=Elsevier | accessdate=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as leading to the detection of reviewers' conflicts of interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Benos DJ, Bashari E, Chaves JM, Gaggar A, Kapoor N, LaFrance M, Mans R, Mayhew D, McGowan S, Polter A, Qadri Y, Sarfare S, Schultz K, Splittgerber R, Stephenson J, Tower C, Walton RG, Zotov A | title = The ups and downs of peer review | journal = Advances in Physiology Education | volume = 31 | issue = 2 | pages = 145–52 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17562902 | doi = 10.1152/advan.00104.2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have also found that open peer review is associated with an increase in quality of reviews,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = Carole J. | last2 = Sugimoto | first2 = Cassidy R. | last3 =Zhang | first3 = Guo | last4 = Cronin | first4 = Blaise | name-list-format = vanc | title = Bias in peer review | journal = Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology | date = January 2013 | volume = 64 | issue = 1 | pages = 2–17 | doi = 10.1002/asi.22784 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although other studies have not found such an association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van Rooyen S, Delamothe T, Evans SJ | title = Effect on peer review of telling reviewers that their signed reviews might be posted on the web: randomised controlled trial | language = en | journal = BMJ | volume = 341 | pages = c5729 | date = November 2010 | pmid = 21081600 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.c5729 | url = http://www.bmj.com/content/341/bmj.c5729 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of [[BioMed Central]] [[medical journal]]s, all of which use open peer review, found that reviewers usually did not notice problems or request changes in reporting of the results of [[randomized trial]]s. The same study found most, but not all, of the requested changes had a positive effect on reporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hopewell S, Collins GS, Boutron I, Yu LM, Cook J, Shanyinde M, Wharton R, Shamseer L, Altman DG | title = Impact of peer review on reports of randomised trials published in open peer review journals: retrospective before and after study | language = en | journal = BMJ | volume = 349 | pages = g4145 | date = July 2014 | pmid = 24986891 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.g4145 | url = http://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g4145 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disadvantages==

A 1999 study found that open peer review did not affect the quality of reviews or the recommendation regarding whether the paper being reviewed should be published, but that it "significantly increased the likelihood of reviewers declining to review".&lt;ref name=vanrooyen/&gt; Open review of abstracts tended to lead to bias favoring authors from English-speaking countries and prestigious academic institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ross JS, Gross CP, Desai MM, Hong Y, Grant AO, Daniels SR, Hachinski VC, Gibbons RJ, Gardner TJ, Krumholz HM | title = Effect of blinded peer review on abstract acceptance | journal = JAMA | volume = 295 | issue = 14 | pages = 1675–80 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16609089 | doi = 10.1001/jama.295.14.1675 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been argued that open peer review could lead to authors accumulating enemies who try to keep their papers from being published or their grant applications from being successful.&lt;ref name=nature/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3346">'''Open Synthetic Biology''' (Open SynBio) is the idea that scientific knowledge and data should be openly accessible through common rights licensing to enable the rapid development of safe, effective and commercially viable [[synthetic biology]] applications.

Its foundational concepts are:

# [[Open science]] is the idea that scientific research should be openly shared to enable massive collaboration (e.g., the [http://polymathprojects.org/ Polymath Project], and [http://Therapoid.net/ open therapeutic effort]).
# The [[Bermuda Principles]] (1996, Rev. 2003) - a private accord declaring that all DNA sequence data should be released in publicly accessible databases within 24 hours after generation.

Open SynBio is a theoretical framework supporting a global ecosystem of responsible and capable research scientists working collaboratively on synthetic biology application development projects to reduce cost,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cost to Develop and Win Marketing Approval for a New Drug Is $2.6 Billion|url=http://csdd.tufts.edu/news/complete_story/pr_tufts_csdd_2014_cost_study|website=Tufts Center for the study of Drug Development|publisher=Tufts University}}&lt;/ref&gt; time, and risks of developing new synthetic biology applications (including Open [[SynBio]] therapeutics) from the inception of primary science to applications reaching market readiness and commercial viability.

Its general principle is that participating research scientists agree to share research, data, findings and results with the [[Open Synthetic Biology]] community and the public generally. The Open [[SynBio]] community will set standards and expectations of the participants and their "science to market" process and the community will work collaboratively with downstream stakeholders (e.g., investors and business advisors) to ensure public safety and general availability of new synthetic biology applications.

One example of open synthetic biology is when [[DNA2.0]] donated several artificial gene sequences into an open-access repository run by the [[BioBricks Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ledford|first=Heidi|date=2013-07-04|title=Bioengineers look beyond patents|url=http://www.nature.com/news/bioengineers-look-beyond-patents-1.13320|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=499|issue=7456|pages=16–17|doi=10.1038/499016a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Phantom of the Poles''''' is a book written by [[William Reed (hollow earth)|William Reed]], and published in 1906. It attempts to explain certain mysterious phenomena reported by [[polar explorers]] by postulating that the [[Earth]] is in fact [[hollow earth|hollow]], with holes at its [[geographical pole|poles]].

==Phenomena to be explained by the Hollow Earth theory==
In the General Summary chapter of ''The Phantom of the Poles'', Reed posed several questions that he claimed were explained by the Hollow Earth theory:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/earth/potp/pop4.htm ''General Summary'']{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} chapter of ''The Phantom of the Poles'' at sacred-texts.com, retrieved November 16, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
# Why is the earth [[flattening|flattened]] at the poles?
# Why have the poles never been reached?
# Why does the sun [[day length|not appear for so long]] in winter near the supposed poles?
# Assuming that the earth is hollow, the interior should be warmer.
# We must now resort to the [[compass]]. Does it refuse to work when drawing near the supposed poles?
# [[Meteors]] are constantly falling near the supposed poles. Why? 
# The next query is concerning the great quantities of dust constantly found in the Arctic Ocean. What causes this dust?
# What produces the [[Aurora Borealis]]?
# [[Icebergs]] are next in order. Where are they formed? And how??
# What causes tidal waves?
# What causes colored snow in the Arctic region?
# Why are the nights so long in the polar regions? 
# What causes the great ice-pressure in the Arctic Ocean during still tide and calm weather?
# Why is the ice filled with rock, gravel, and sand? 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Failure of Reed's theory==
[[Admiral Peary]] claimed to have reached the [[North Pole]] on April 6, 1909.  This would have invalidated Reed's premise that the poles cannot be reached. Although Peary's claim was, in its day, and continues to be [[Robert Peary#Controversy|controversial]], on December 14, 1911, [[Roald Amundsen]] undisputedly reached the [[South Pole]].  Subsequent expeditions to and flights over the south pole have conclusively demonstrated that there are no large holes there.

The term '''private-collective model of innovation''' was coined by [[Eric von Hippel]] and [[Georg von Krogh]] in their 2003 publication in ''[[Organization Science: A Journal of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences|Organization Science]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Eric von Hippel and Georg von Krogh (2003) "Open Source Software and the 'Private-Collective' Innovation Model: Issues for Organization Science" Organization Science 14, 209-223.&lt;/ref&gt; This innovation model represents a combination of the private investment model and the collective-action innovation model.

In the '''private investment model''' innovators appropriate financial returns from innovations through [[intellectual property rights]] such as patents, copyright, licenses, or trade secrets. Any [[knowledge spillover]] reduces the innovator's benefits, thus freely revealed knowledge is not in the interest of the innovator.

The '''[[Collective action|collective-action innovation model]]''' explains the creation of [[public goods]] which are defined by the non-rivalry of benefits and non-excludable access to the good. In this case the innovators do not benefit more than any one else not investing into the public good, thus [[Free rider problem|free-riding]] occurs. In response to this problem, the cost of innovation has to be distributed, therefore governments typically invest into public goods through public funding.

As combination of these two models, the private-collective model of innovation explains the creation of public goods through private funding. The model is based on the assumption that the innovators privately creating the public goods benefit more than the free-riders only consuming the public good. While the result of the investment is equally available to all, the innovators benefit through the ''process'' of creating the public good. Therefore, private-collective innovation occurs when the process-related rewards exceed the process-related costs.&lt;ref&gt;Democratizing innovation (2005) Eric von Hippel, MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Georg von Krogh (2008) "Researching the Private-Collective Innovation Model" The SAGE Handbook of New Approaches in Management and Organization, Daved Barry and Hans Hansen (ed.) Sage, 396-397.&lt;/ref&gt;

A laboratory study&lt;ref&gt;Gächter, S., von Krogh, G., Haefliger, S. "Initiating private-collective innovation: The fragility of knowledge sharing," Research Policy, 39(7), 2010, pp. 893-906.&lt;/ref&gt; traced the initiation of private-collective innovation to the first decision to share knowledge in a two-person game with multiple equilibria. The results indicate fragility: when individuals face opportunity costs to sharing their knowledge with others they quickly turn away from the social optimum of mutual sharing. The opportunity costs of the "second player", the second person deciding whether to share, have a bigger (negative) impact on knowledge sharing than the opportunity costs of the first person to decide. Overall, the study also observed sharing behavior in situations where none was predicted.

Recent work&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Helena Garriga, Efe Aksuyek, Georg F. von Krogh, Fredrik Hacklin, What social preferences matter in private-collective innovation? Behavioral game theory in collective action, Technology Analysis and Strategic Management, Forthcoming&lt;/ref&gt; shows that a project will not "take off" unless the right incentives are in place for innovators to contribute their knowledge to open innovation from the beginning. The article&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; explores social preferences in the initiation of PCI. It conducted a simulation study that elucidates how inequality aversion, reciprocity, and fairness affect the underlying conditions that lead to the initiation of Private-collective innovation.

While firms increasingly seek to cooperate with outside individuals and organizations to tap into their ideas for new products and services, mechanisms that motivate innovators to "open up" are critical in achieving the benefits of open innovation.

The theory of private collective innovation has recently been extended by a study on the exclusion rights for technology in the competition between private-collective and other innovators.&lt;ref&gt;Alexy, O., Reitzig, M. "Private-collective innovation, competition, and firms' counterintuitive appropriation strategies", Research Policy, 42(4), 2013, pp. 895-913.&lt;/ref&gt; The authors argue that the investment in orphan exclusion rights for technology serves as a subtle coordination mechanism against alternative proprietary solutions.

Additionally, the research on private-collective innovation has been extended with theoretical explanations and empirical evidence of egoism and altruism as significant explanations for cooperation in private-collective innovation. Benbunan-Fich and Koufaris&lt;ref&gt;Benbunan-Fich, R., Koufaris, M., "Public contributions to private-collective systems: the case of social bookmarking", Internet Research, 23(2), 2013, pp. 183-203.&lt;/ref&gt; show that contributions to a social bookmarking site are a combination of intentional and unintentional contributions. The intentional public contribution of bookmarks is driven by an egoistic motivation to contribute valuable information and thus showing competence.

==Example: Development of Free and Libre Open Source Software==

The development of '''[[Open source|open source software]]''' / '''[[Free software|Free Software]]''' (consequently named Free and Libre Open Source Software – '''[[FLOSS]]''') is the most prominent example of private-collective innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Eric von Hippel and Georg von Krogh "Free revealing and the private-collective model of innovation incentives", R&amp;D Management, 36(3), 2006, pp. 295-306.&lt;/ref&gt; By definition, FLOSS represents a '''[[public good]]'''. It is [[Non-rivalrous|non-rival]] because copying and distributing software does not decrease its value. And it is [[non-excludable]] because FLOSS licenses enable everyone to use, change and redistribute the software without any restriction.

While FLOSS is created by many unpaid individuals, it has been shown&lt;ref&gt;Matthias Stuermer, Sebastian Spaeth, and Georg von Krogh, G. (2009) "Extending private-collective innovation: a case study" R&amp;D Management 39(2), 170-191.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian Spaeth, Matthias Stuermer, Georg von Krogh (2010) "Enabling Knowledge Creation Through Outsiders: Towards a Push Model of Open Innovation" International Journal of Technology Management (Forthcoming Special Issue on Open Innovation).&lt;/ref&gt; that technology firms invest substantially in the development of FLOSS. These companies release previously proprietary software under FLOSS licenses, employ programmers to work on established FLOSS projects, and fund entrepreneurial firms to develop certain features. In this way, private entities invest into the creation of public goods.

A '''research proposal''' is a document [[wikt:proposal|proposing]] a [[research]] project, generally in the [[science]]s or [[academia]], and generally constitutes a request for [[funding of science|sponsorship]] of that research.&lt;ref name="bizdict"&gt;{{cite web|title=Research proposal|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/research-proposal.html|website=BusinessDictionary.com|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proposals are evaluated on the cost and potential impact of the proposed research, and on the soundness of the proposed plan for carrying it out.&lt;ref name="Wong"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wong|first1=Paul T. P.|title=How to Write a Research Proposal|url=http://www.meaning.ca/archives/archive/art_how_to_write_P_Wong.htm|publisher=International Network on Personal Meaning|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research proposals generally address several key points:&lt;ref name="uiac"&gt;{{cite web|title=Writing a Research Proposal|url=http://www.library.illinois.edu/learn/research/proposal.html|publisher=[[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]]|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wong"/&gt;
* What [[research question]](s) will be addressed, and [[research design|how]] they will be addressed
* How much time and [[cost estimate|expense]] will be required for the research
* What [[literature review|prior research]] has been done on the topic
* How the results of the research will be evaluated
* How the research will benefit the sponsoring organization and other parties

==Types==
Research proposals may be ''solicited'', meaning that they are submitted in response to a request with specified requirements, such as a [[request for proposal]], or they may be ''unsolicited'', meaning they are submitted without prior request. Other types of proposals include "preproposals", where a [[letter of intent]] or brief [[Abstract (summary)|abstract]] is submitted for review prior to submission of a full proposal; continuation proposals, which re-iterate an original proposal and its funding requirements in order to ensure continued funding; and renewal proposals, which seek continued sponsorship of a project which would otherwise be terminated.&lt;ref name="uiac"/&gt;

Academic research proposals are generally written as part of the initial requirements of writing a [[thesis]], [[Academic paper|research paper]], or dissertation. They generally follow the same format as a research paper, with an introduction, a [[literature review]], a discussion of research [[methodology]] and goals, and a conclusion. This basic structure may vary between projects and between fields, each of which may have its own requirements.

&lt;/ref&gt;
A director from the Office of Science division of Workforce Development for Teachers and Scientists, Peter Faletra, suggested the change from the older acronym SMET to STEM. Colwell, expressing some dislike for the older acronym, responded by suggesting NSF institute the change. However, the acronym STEM predates NSF and likely traces its origin to Charles Vela, the founder and director of the Center for the Advancement of Hispanics in Science and Engineering Education (CAHSEE)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cahsee.org/about/about.asp.htm|title=CAHSEE - About CAHSEE|website=www.cahsee.org|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://stem.ccny.cuny.edu/|title=STEM Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics - Main|website=stem.ccny.cuny.edu|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kqnRETS9FWwC|title=Hispanic Engineer &amp; IT|last=Group|first=Career Communications|date=1996|publisher=Career Communications Group|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  In the early 1990's CAHSEE started a summer program for talented under-represented students in the Washington, DC area called the STEM Institute.  Based on the program's recognized success and his expertise in STEM education&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=100381&amp;org=HRD&amp;from=news|title=President Bush Honors Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring {{!}} NSF - National Science Foundation|website=www.nsf.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Charles Vela was asked to serve on numerous NSF and Congressional panels in science, mathematics and engineering education&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cahsee.org/about/founder.asp.htm|title=CAHSEE - Founder's Biography|website=www.cahsee.org|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;; it is through this manner that NSF was first introduced to the acronym STEM.  One of the first NSF projects to use the acronym{{cn|date=May 2018}} was STEMTEC, the Science, Technology, Engineering and Math Teacher Education Collaborative at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], which was founded in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;

==Geographic distribution==

===United States===

In the United States, the acronym began to be used in education and immigration debates in initiatives to begin to address the perceived lack of qualified candidates for high-tech jobs. It also addresses concern that the subjects are often taught in isolation, instead of as an integrated curriculum.&lt;ref name="STEM PA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iu1stemcenter.org/files/CMU_and_IU_STEM_Survey.pdf |title=STEM Education in Southwestern Pennsylvania |year=2008 |publisher=The Intermediate Unit 1 Center for STEM Education |accessdate=2012-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Maintaining a citizenry that is well versed in the STEM fields is a key portion of the [[public education]] agenda of the United States.&lt;ref name="USNEWS2012"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/stem-education/2012/07/26/us-news-inducts-five-to-stem-leadership-hall-of-fame |title=U.S. News Inducts Five to STEM Leadership Hall of Fame |date=July 26, 2012 |author=Morella, Michael |publisher=U.S. News &amp; World Report |accessdate=2012-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The acronym has been widely used in the immigration debate regarding access to United States [[work visa]]s for [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants]] who are skilled in these fields. It has also become commonplace in education discussions as a reference to the shortage of skilled workers and inadequate education in these areas.&lt;ref name="Bill Clinton Lays Out"&gt;{{cite news

====National Science Foundation====
Many organizations in the United States follow the guidelines of the [[National Science Foundation]] on what constitutes a STEM field. The NSF uses a broader definition of STEM subjects that includes subjects in the fields of [[chemistry]], [[Computer science|computer]] and [[information technology]] science, engineering, geosciences, life sciences, mathematical sciences, physics and astronomy, [[social sciences]] ([[anthropology]], [[economics]], [[psychology]] and [[sociology]]), and STEM education and learning research.&lt;ref name="fas.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nsf.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2012/nsf12599/nsf12599.htm#appendix|title=Graduate Research Fellowship Program|work=nsf.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eligibility for scholarship programs such as the CSM STEM Scholars Program use the NSF definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmd.edu/istem/scholarship_stem.html |title=ISTEM – College of Southern Maryland }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NSF is the only American federal agency whose mission includes support for all fields of fundamental science and engineering, except for medical sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nsf.gov/about/what.jsp |title=What We Do |publisher=The National Science Foundation |accessdate=2012-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its disciplinary program areas include scholarships, grants, fellowships in fields such as biological sciences, computer and [[information science]] and  engineering, education and human resources, engineering, environmental research and education, geosciences, international science and engineering, mathematical and physical sciences, social, behavioral and economic sciences, cyberinfrastructure, and polar programs.&lt;ref name="nsf.gov"/&gt;

====Immigration policy====
Although many organizations in the United States follow the guidelines of the [[National Science Foundation]] on what constitutes a STEM field, the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) has its own functional definition used for immigration policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42530.pdf|format=PDF|title=Immigration of Foreign Nationals with Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Degrees|website=Fas.org|accessdate=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, DHS or ICE announced an expanded list of STEM designated-degree programs that qualify eligible graduates on student visas for an optional practical training (OPT) extension. Under the OPT program, international students who graduate from colleges and universities in the United States are able to remain in the country and receive training through work experience for up to 12 months. Students who graduate from a designated STEM degree program can remain for an additional 17 months on an OPT STEM extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DHS Expands List of STEM designated-degree programs|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/dhs-expands-list-stem-designated-degree-programs |publisher=Fowler White Boggs P.A. |author=Jennifer G.

====STEM-eligible degrees in US immigration====
{{Details|topic=Temporary foreign workers|Global labor arbitrage|H-1B visa|Optional Practical Training}}

An exhaustive list of STEM disciplines does not exist because the definition varies by organization. The [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] lists disciplines including&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ice.gov/sevis/stemlist.htm |title=STEM Designated Degree Programs |date=April 2008 |publisher=U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement |accessdate=2012-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[physics]], [[actuarial science]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[mathematics]], [[applied mathematics]], [[statistics]], [[computer science]], [[computational science]], [[psychology]], [[biochemistry]], [[robotics]], [[computer engineering]], [[electrical engineering]], [[electronics]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[industrial engineering]], [[information science]], [[information technology]], [[civil engineering]], [[aerospace engineering]], [[chemical engineering]], [[astrophysics]], [[astronomy]], [[optics]], [[nanotechnology]], [[nuclear physics]], [[mathematical biology]], [[operations research]], [[neurobiology]], [[biomechanics]], [[bioinformatics]], [[acoustical engineering]], [[geographic information system]]s, [[atmospheric sciences]], [[Educational technology|educational/instructional technology]], [[software engineering]], and [[educational research]].

====Education====
By cultivating an interest in the natural and social sciences in preschool or immediately following school entry, the chances of STEM success in high school can be greatly improved. [[School segregation|School integration]] can  help black, Hispanic and aboriginal students catch up with Asian and white students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

STEM supports broadening the study of [[engineering]] within each of the other subjects, and beginning engineering at younger grades, even elementary school. It also brings STEM education to all students rather than only the gifted programs. In his 2012 budget, President Barack Obama renamed and broadened the "''Mathematics and Science Partnership (MSP)''" to award block grants to states for improving teacher education in those subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2012/02/obamas-budget-shuffles-stem.html |title=Obama's Budget Shuffles STEM Education Deck |date=14 February 2012 |author=Jane J.

In the 2015 run of the international assessment test the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), American students came out 35th in mathematics, 24th in reading and 25th in science, out of 109 countries. The United States also ranked 29th in the percentage of 24-year-olds with science or mathematics degrees&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/pisa/|title=Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) - Overview|website=nces.ed.gov|language=EN|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

STEM education often uses new technologies such as [[RepRap]] [[3D printers]] to encourage interest in STEM fields.&lt;ref&gt;J.L. Irwin, D.E. Oppliger, J.M. Pearce, G. Anzalone, [http://www.asee.org/file_server/papers/attachment/file/0005/4988/asee_K-12_2015_finalpaper.pdf Evaluation of RepRap 3D Printer Workshops in K-12 STEM]. ''122nd ASEE 122nd ASEE Conf.

In 2006 the [[United States National Academies]] expressed their concern about the declining state of STEM education in the United States. Its Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy developed a list of 10 actions. Their top three recommendations were to:
* Increase America's talent pool by improving K–12 science and mathematics education
* Strengthen the skills of teachers through additional training in science, mathematics and technology
* Enlarge the pipeline of students prepared to enter college and graduate with STEM degrees&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.slsd.org/webpages/rcolelli/resources.cfm?subpage=493006|title=STEM Education|website=Slsd.org|access-date=2016-06-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170126095634/http://www.slsd.org/webpages/rcolelli/resources.cfm?subpage=493006|archivedate=2017-01-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] also has implemented programs and curricula to advance STEM education in order to replenish the pool of scientists, engineers and mathematicians who will lead space exploration in the 21st century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Individual states, such as [[California]], have run pilot after-school STEM programs to learn what the most promising practices are and how to implement them to increase the chance of student success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://powerofdiscovery.org/sites/default/files/cde_report_task_10_and_11.pdf|format=PDF|title=Final Report : California Department of Education : CDE Agreement|website=Powerofdiscovery.org|accessdate=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another state to invest in STEM education is Florida, where [https://floridapolytechnic.org/ Florida Polytechnic University], Florida’s first public university for engineering and technology dedicated to science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = About Florida Polytechnic University|url = https://floridapolytechnic.org/about/|website = Florida Polytechnic University|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During school, STEM programs have been established for many districts throughout the U.S.  Some states include [[New Jersey]], [[Arizona]], [[Virginia]], [[North Carolina]], [[Texas]], and [[Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.olentangy.k12.oh.us/domain/1012|title=STEM Academy / Overview|website=www.olentangy.k12.oh.us|language=en|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/best-high-schools/national-rankings/stem|title=Best STEM High schools|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continuing STEM education has expanded to the post-secondary level through masters programs such as the University of Maryland's STEM Program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.education.umd.edu/MathEd/Outreach/DDP_MCPSSTEM%20.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910215842/http://www.education.umd.edu/MathEd/Outreach/DDP_MCPSSTEM%20.html |archivedate=2014-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the University of Cincinnati.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mastersed.uc.edu/masters-degree-in-education-online-programs/stem-science-technology-engineering-mathematics-teacher-degree/stem-degree-that-inspires-innovation/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910200320/http://mastersed.uc.edu/masters-degree-in-education-online-programs/stem-science-technology-engineering-mathematics-teacher-degree/stem-degree-that-inspires-innovation/ |archivedate=2014-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Racial gap in STEM fields====
In the United States, the National Science Foundation found that the average science score on the 2011 National Assessment of Educational Progress was lower for black and Hispanic students than white, Asian, and Pacific Islanders.&lt;ref&gt;"Science and Engineering Indicators 2014." S&amp;E Indicators 2014 - Figures - US National Science Foundation (NSF). N.p., n.d.

====American Competitiveness Initiative====
In the [[State of the Union Address]] on January 31, 2006, President [[George W. Bush]] announced the [[American Competitiveness Initiative]]. Bush proposed the initiative to address shortfalls in federal government support of educational development and progress at all academic levels in the STEM fields. In detail, the initiative called for significant increases in federal funding for advanced [[R&amp;D]] programs (including a doubling of federal funding support for advanced research in the physical sciences through [[United States Department of Energy|DOE]]) and an increase in U.S. higher education graduates within STEM disciplines.

The ''NASA Means Business'' competition, sponsored by the Texas Space Grant Consortium, furthers that goal. College students compete to develop promotional plans to encourage students in middle and high school to study STEM subjects and to inspire professors in STEM fields to involve their students in outreach activities that support STEM education.

The [[National Science Foundation]] has numerous programs in STEM education, including some for K–12 students such as the ITEST Program that supports The Global Challenge Award ITEST Program. STEM programs have been implemented in some [[Arizona]] schools. They implement higher cognitive skills for students and enable them to inquire and use techniques used by professionals in the STEM fields.

The STEM Academy is a national nonprofit-status organization dedicated to improving STEM literacy for all students. It represents a recognized national next-generation high-impact academic model. The practices, strategies, and programming are built upon a foundation of identified national best practices which are designed to improve under-represented minority and low-income student growth, close achievement gaps, decrease dropout rates, increase high school graduation rates and improve teacher and principal effectiveness. The STEM Academy represents a flexible use academic model that targets all schools and is for all students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stem101.org/about.asp|title=stemacademy|website=Stem101.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Project Lead The Way]] (PLTW) is a leading provider of STEM education curricular programs to middle and high schools in the United States. The national nonprofit organization has over 5,200 programs in over 4,700 schools in all 50 states. Programs include a high school engineering curriculum called ''Pathway To Engineering'', a high school biomedical sciences program, and a middle school engineering and technology program called ''Gateway To Technology''. PLTW provides the curriculum and the teacher professional development and ongoing support to create transformational programs in schools, districts, and communities. PLTW programs have been endorsed by President [[Barack Obama]] and [[United States Secretary of Education]] [[Arne Duncan]] as well as various state, national, and business leaders.

====Legislation====
The [[America COMPETES Act]] (P.L. 110-69) became law on August 9, 2007. It is intended to increase the nation's investment in science and engineering research and in STEM education from kindergarten to graduate school and postdoctoral education. The act authorizes funding increases for the [[National Science Foundation]], [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] laboratories, and the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] (DOE) Office of Science over FY2008–FY2010. Robert Gabrys, Director of Education at NASA's [[Goddard Space Flight Center]], articulated success as increased student achievement, early expression of student interest in STEM subjects, and student preparedness to enter the workforce.

====Jobs====
In November 2012 the [[White House]] announcement before congressional vote on the STEM Jobs Act put President Obama in opposition to many of the Silicon Valley firms and executives who bankrolled his re-election campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57556074-38/obama-opposes-silicon-valley-firms-on-immigration-reform/ |title=Obama opposes Silicon Valley firms on immigration reform |date=November 28, 2012 |author=Declan McCullagh |publisher=CNET |accessdate=2012-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Department of Labor identified 14 sectors that are "projected to add substantial numbers of new jobs to [[Economy of the United States|the economy]] or affect the growth of other industries or are being transformed by technology and innovation requiring new sets of skills for workers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doleta.gov/Youth_services/pdf/STEM_Report_4%2007.pdf |title=The STEM Workforce Challenge: the Role of the Public Workforce System in a National Solution for a Competitive Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Workforce |date=April 2007 |publisher=U.S. Department of Labor |accessdate=2012-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The identified sectors were as follows: [[advanced manufacturing]], [[Automotive]], [[Construction industry|construction]], [[financial services]], [[geospatial technology]], [[homeland security]], [[information technology]], [[Transportation]], [[Aerospace]], [[Biotechnology]], [[Energy industry|energy]], [[Health care industry|healthcare]], [[Hospitality industry|hospitality]], and [[Retail industry|retail]].

The [[United States Department of Commerce|Department of Commerce]] notes STEM fields careers are some of the best-paying and have the greatest potential for job growth in the early 21st century. The report also notes that STEM workers play a key role in the sustained growth and stability of the U.S. economy, and training in STEM fields generally results in higher wages, whether or not they work in a STEM field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.doc.gov/Reports/stem-good-jobs-now-and-future|title=STEM: Good Jobs Now and For the Future|work=doc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, there were around 9.0 million STEM jobs in the United States, representing 6.1% of American employment. STEM jobs were increasing around 9% percent per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.esa.doc.gov/reports/stem-jobs-2017-update|title=STEM Jobs: 2017 Update {{!}} Economics &amp; Statistics Administration|website=www.esa.doc.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Brookings Institution found that the demand for competent technology graduates will surpass the number of capable applicants by at least one million individuals.  The BLS noted that almost 100 percent of STEM jobs require postsecondary education, while only 36 percent of other jobs call for that same degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://publicpolicy.wharton.upenn.edu/live/news/2188-building-americas-future-stem-education/for-students/blog/news.php|title=Building America’s Future: STEM Education Intervention is a Win-Win|website=Penn Wharton Public Policy Initative|language=en|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Updates ====
PEW findings revealed that Americans identified several issues that hound STEM education which included unconcerned parents, disinterested students, obsolete curriculum materials, and too much focus on state parameters. 57 percent of survey respondents pointed out that one main problem of STEM is lack of students’ concentration in learning&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thejournal.com/articles/2018/01/12/americans-rate-u.s.-stem-education-as-mediocre.aspx|title=Americans Rate U.S. K–12 STEM Education as Mediocre -- THE Journal|website=THE Journal|language=en|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The report showed a gap of 28 points between low-income students and their high-income counterparts. The same report also indicated a 38-point difference between white and black students&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2017/09/25/suddenly-trump-wants-to-spend-millions-of-dollars-on-stem-in-public-schools/|title=Analysis {{!}} Suddenly, Trump wants to spend millions of dollars on STEM in public schools|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The 2019 fiscal budget proposal of the White House supported the funding plan in President Donald Trump’s Memorandum on STEM Education which allocated around $200 million (grant funding) on STEM education every year. This budget also supports STEM through a grant program worth $20 million for career as well as technical education programs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://edscoop.com/trump-stands-by-stem-education-spending-in-fy19-budget|title=Trump stands by STEM education spending in fiscal 2019 budget|website=EdScoop|language=en|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Canada===
Canada ranks 12th out of 16 peer countries in the percentage of its graduates who studied in STEM programs, with 21.2%, a number higher than the United States, but lower than [[France]], [[Germany]], and [[Austria]]. The peer country with the greatest proportion of STEM graduates, [[Finland]], has over 30% of their university graduates coming from science, mathematics, computer science, and engineering programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conferenceboard.ca/hcp/details/education/graduates-science-math-computer-science-engineerin.aspx|title=Graduates in science, math, computer science, and engineering|website=Conferenceboard.ca|accessdate=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SHAD is an annual Canadian summer enrichment program for high-achieving [[high school]] students in July. The program focuses on academic learning particularly in STEAM fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.shad.ca/userContent/documents/SHAD_BROCHURE_EN.pdf|title=SHAD Brochure|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Scouts Canada]] has taken similar measures to their American counterpart to promote STEM fields to youth. Their STEM program began in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scouts.ca/stem/activities.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811173225/http://www.scouts.ca/stem/activities.html |archivedate=2014-08-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 Canadian entrepreneur and philanthropist [[Seymour Schulich]] established the [[Schulich Leader Scholarships]], $100 million in $60,000 scholarships for students beginning their university education in a STEM program at 20 institutions across Canada. Each year 40 Canadian students would be selected to receive the award, two at each institution, with the goal of attracting gifted youth into the STEM fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Toronto philanthropist Schulich unveils $100-million scholarship |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/toronto-philanthropist-schulich-unveils-100-million-scholarship/article2201382/|website=Theglobeandmail.com|accessdate=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program also supplies STEM scholarships to five participating universities in [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Philanthropist Makes $100 Million Investment In Nation’s Future|url=http://www.shalomlife.com/news/16038/philanthropist-makes-100-million-investment-in-nations-future/|website=Shalomlife.com|accessdate=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===
Several European projects have promoted STEM education and careers in Europe. For instance, Scientix&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scientix Project|url=http://www.scientix.eu/|accessdate=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a European cooperation of STEM teachers, education scientists, and policymakers. The SciChallenge&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Achilleos|first1=Achilleas|last2=Mettouris|first2=Christos|last3=Yeratziotis|first3=Alexandros|last4=Papadopoulos|first4=George|last5=Pllana|first5=Sabri|last6=Huber|first6=Florian|last7=Jaeger|first7=Bernhard|last8=Leitner|first8=Peter|last9=Ocsovszky|first9=Zsofia|last10=Dinnyes|first10=Andras|title=SciChallenge: A Social Media Aware Platform for Contest-Based STEM Education and Motivation of Young Students|journal=IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies|date=March 2018|doi=10.1109/TLT.2018.2810879|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8305513/?reload=true|accessdate=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; project used a social media contest and the student-generated content to increase motivation of pre- university students for STEM education and careers.

=== Hong Kong ===
STEM education has not been promoted among the local schools in Hong Kong until recent years. In November 2015, the Education Bureau of Hong Kong released a document entitled ''Promotion of STEM Education'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edb.gov.hk/attachment/en/curriculum-development/renewal/Brief%20on%20STEM%20(Overview)_eng_20151105.pdf|format=PDF|title=Promotion of STEM Education |website=Edb.gov.hk|accessdate=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; which proposes the strategies and recommendations on promoting STEM education.

===Turkey===
Turkish STEM Education Task Force (or FeTeMM—Fen Bilimleri, Teknoloji, Mühendislik ve Matematik) is a coalition of academicians and teachers who show an effort to increase the quality of education in STEM fields rather than focussing on increasing the number of STEM graduates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FeTeMM Çalışma Grubu|url=http://fetemm.org/|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=STEM Education Task Force|url=http://tstem.com/|website=Tstem.com |accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Qatar===
In [[Qatar]], [[AL-Bairaq]] is an outreach program to high-school students with a curriculum that focuses on STEM, run by the Center for Advanced Materials (CAM) at [[Qatar University]]. Each year around 946 students, from about 40 high schools, participate in AL-Bairaq competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qu.edu.qa/offices/research/CAM/dmsprogram/index.php|title=AlBairaq World - Welcome to Al-Bairaq World|date=19 April 2014|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=20 August 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419220638/http://www.qu.edu.qa/offices/research/CAM/dmsprogram/index.php|archivedate=19 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; AL-Bairaq make use of project-based learning, encourages students to solve authentic problems, and inquires them to work with each other as a team to build real solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov.qa/En/Media/News/Pages/NewsDetails.aspx?NewsID=3405|title=Supreme Education Council|website=Sec.gov.qa|accessdate=2017-08-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630045928/http://www.sec.gov.qa/En/Media/News/Pages/NewsDetails.aspx?NewsID=3405|archivedate=2017-06-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thepeninsulaqatar.com/news/qatar/283245/al-bairaq-holds-workshop-for-high-school-students|title=The Peninsula Qatar - Al Bairaq holds workshop for high school students|website=Thepeninsulaqatar.com|accessdate=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has so far shown positive results for the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejes.eu/images/issue/vol.1/no.3/4.pdf|title=Al-Ghanim, K.A; Al-Maadeed, M.A and Al-Thani, N.J (Sept. 2014) : IMPACT OF INNOVATIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT BASED ON RESEARCH ACTIVITIES ON SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS' ATTITUDE TOWARDS RESEARCH AND THEIR SELF-EFFICACY, EJES, 1(3), 39-57|website=Ejes.eu|accessdate=2017-08-20}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vietnam ===
In Vietnam, beginning in 2012 many private education organizations has STEM education initiatives.

In 2015, the Ministry of Science and Technology and Liên minh STEM organized the first National STEM day, followed by many similar events across the country.

in 2015, Ministry of Education and Training included STEM as an area needed to be encouraged in national school year program.

In May 2017, Prime Minister signed a [http://vanban.chinhphu.vn/portal/page/portal/chinhphu/hethongvanban?class_id=2&amp;mode=detail&amp;document_id=189610 Directive no. 16] stating: "Dramatically change the policies, contents, education and vocational training methods to create a human resource capable of receiving new production technology trends, with a focus on promoting training in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), foreign languages, information technology in general education; " and asking "Ministry of Education and Training (to): Promote the deployment of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education in general education program; Pilot organize in some high schools from 2017 to 2018.

==Women==
[[File:Woman teaching geometry.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|&lt;center&gt;"Woman teaching geometry"&lt;/center&gt; Illustration at the beginning of a [[medieval]] translation of Euclid's ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'' ({{circa|1310 AD}})]]
{{main article|Female education in STEM|Women in STEM fields}}
{{see also|Women in science|Women in engineering|Women in computing|Sex differences in psychology|Sex differences in intelligence}}

Women constitute 47% of the U.S. workforce, and perform 24% of STEM-related jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.doc.gov/reports/women-stem-2017-update|title=Women in STEM: 2017 Update| access-date=September 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK women perform 13% of STEM-related jobs (2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westminster.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/business/2014/science-careers-face-diversity-challenge|title=Science careers face diversity challenge|work=westminster.ac.uk|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018110732/http://www.westminster.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/business/2014/science-careers-face-diversity-challenge|archivedate=2014-10-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S. women with STEM degrees are more likely to work in education or healthcare rather than STEM fields compared with their male counterparts.

The gender ratio depends on field of study. For example, in the [[European Union]] in 2012 women made up 47.3% of the total, 51% of the social sciences, business and law, 42% of the science, mathematics and computing, 28% of engineering, manufacturing and construction, and 59% of PhD graduates in Health and Welfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|date= 2016|title= She Figures 2015|url= https://ec.europa.eu/research/swafs/pdf/pub_gender_equality/she_figures_2015-final.pdf#view=fit&amp;pagemode=none|publisher= European Commission|page= |access-date= 15 September 2018 |ISBN=978-92-79-48375-2|doi=10.2777/744106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The focus on increasing participation in STEM fields has attracted criticism. In the 2014 article "The Myth of the Science and Engineering Shortage" in ''[[The Atlantic]]'', demographer Michael S. Teitelbaum criticized the efforts of the U.S. government to increase the number of STEM graduates, saying that, among studies on the subject, "No one has been able to find any evidence indicating current widespread labor market shortages or hiring difficulties in science and engineering occupations that require bachelor's degrees or higher", and that "Most studies report that real wages in many—but not all—science and engineering occupations have been flat or slow-growing, and unemployment as high or higher than in many comparably-skilled occupations." Teitelbaum also wrote that the then-current national fixation on increasing STEM participation paralleled previous U.S. government efforts since [[World War II]] to increase the number of scientists and engineers, all of which he stated ultimately ended up in "mass layoffs, hiring freezes, and funding cuts"; including one driven by the [[Space Race]] of the late 1950s and 1960s, which he wrote led to "a bust of serious magnitude in the 1970s."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Myth of the Science and Engineering Shortage |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/03/the-myth-of-the-science-and-engineering-shortage/284359/ |first=Michael S. |last=Teitelbaum |work=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[IEEE Spectrum]]'' contributing editor Robert N. Charette echoed these sentiments in the 2013 article "The STEM Crisis Is a Myth", also noting that there was a "mismatch between earning a STEM degree and having a STEM job" in the United States, with only around ¼ of STEM graduates working in STEM fields, while less than half of workers in STEM fields have a STEM degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The STEM Crisis Is a Myth |url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/at-work/education/the-stem-crisis-is-a-myth |first=Robert N. |last=Charette |publisher=IEEE Spectrum |date=August 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economics writer Ben Casselman, in a 2014 study of post-graduation earnings for ''[[FiveThirtyEight]]'', wrote that, based on the data, science should not be grouped with the other three STEM categories, because, while the other three generally result in high-paying jobs, "many sciences, particularly the [[life sciences]], pay below the overall median for recent college graduates."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Economic Guide To Picking A College Major |url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economic-guide-to-picking-a-college-major/ |first=Ben |last=Casselman |publisher=FiveThirtyEight |date=September 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Efforts to remedy the perceived domination of STEM subjects by men of Asian and non-Hispanic European backgrounds has led to intense efforts to diversify the STEM workforce. However, some critics feel that this practice in higher education, as opposed to a strict [[meritocracy]], causes lower academic standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Science Education|'''Science education''']] [[Education in England|''' in England''']] is generally regulated at all levels for assessments that are England's, from 'primary' to 'tertiary' ([[university]]). Below university-level, science education is the responsibility of three bodies: the [[Department for Education]], [[Ofqual]] and the [[Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education|QAA]], but at university-level, science education is regulated by various ''professional bodies'', and the [[Bologna Process]] via the QAA. The QAA also regulates science education for some qualifications that are not university [[Academic degree|degrees]] via various ''qualification boards'', but not content for [[General Certificate of Secondary Education|GCSEs]], and [[GCE Advanced Level (United Kingdom)|GCE AS and A levels]]. Ofqual on the other hand regulates science education for GCSEs and AS/A levels, as well as all other qualifications, except those covered by the QAA, also via qualification boards. The Department for Education prescribes the content for science education for GCSEs and AS/A levels&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Department for Education|authorlink = Department for Education|title = GCE AS and A level subject content for biology, chemistry, physics and psychology|publisher = Department for Education|series = AS and A level subject content and requirements |year = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which is implemented by the qualification boards, who are then regulated by Ofqual. The Department for Education also regulates science education for students aged 16 years and under. The department's policies on science education (and indeed all subjects) are implemented by [[Local government in England|local government authorities]] on all [[state school]]s (also called ''publicly funded'' schools) in England. The content of the nationally organised science curriculum (along with other subjects) for England is published in the [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]], which covers [[Key Stage 1|key stage 1 (KS1)]], [[Key Stage 2|key stage 2 (KS2)]], [[Key Stage 3|key stage 3 (KS3)]] and [[Key Stage 4|key stage 4 (KS4)]]. The four key stages can be grouped a number of ways; how they are grouped significantly affects [[#Compulsory science content and national assessments|the way the science curriculum is delivered]]. In state schools, the four key stages are grouped into KS1–2 and KS3–4; KS1–2 covers primary education while KS3–4 covers secondary education. But in [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|independent]] or [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public (which in the United Kingdom are historic independent)]] schools (not to be confused with 'publicly funded' schools), the key stage grouping is more variable, and rather than using the terms ‘primary’ and 'secondary’, the terms ‘prep’ and ‘senior’ are used instead. Science is a compulsory subject in the National Curriculum of England, [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]];&lt;ref name="ERA1988"&gt;{{cite book|title = Education Reform Act 1988 c40|publisher = HMSO|year = 1989|isbn = 0 10 544088 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; state schools have to follow the National Curriculum while independent schools need not follow it. That said, science is compulsory in the [[Common Entrance Examination]] for entry into senior schools, so it does feature prominently in the curricula of independent schools. Beyond the National Curriculum and Common Entrance Examination, science is voluntary, but the government of the [[United Kingdom]] (comprising England, Wales, [[Scotland]] and Northern Ireland) provides [[#Challenges for science education in England|incentives for students to continue studying science subjects]]. Science is regarded as vital to the economic growth of the United Kingdom (UK).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = House of Commons|first = Science and Technology Committee|authorlink = House of Commons of the United Kingdom|title = The science budget: First Report of Session 2015–16|publisher = House of Commons|year = 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For students aged 16 years (the upper limit of compulsory ''school age'' in England, but not compulsory education as a whole) and over, there is no ''compulsory'' nationally organised science curriculum for all state/publicly funded education providers in England to follow, and individual providers can set their own content, although they often (and in the case of England's state/publicly funded post-16 schools and colleges have to&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-to-have-your-qualifications-regulated|title=Guidance: Apply to have your qualifications regulated|author=Ofqual|date=8 March 2017|publisher=gov.uk|accessdate=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstohe.ac.uk/HowCourses/AVA-profiles/Pages/Default.aspx|title=Access to Higher Education: Access Validating Agency profiles|author=Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education|publisher=The Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qaa.ac.uk/about-us|title=QAA: About us|author=The Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education|publisher=The Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;) get their science (and indeed all) courses ''accredited'' or made ''satisfactory'' (ultimately by either Ofqual or the QAA via the qualification boards). Universities do not need such approval, but [[#Science education at university-level|there is a reason for them to seek accreditation]] regardless. Moreover, UK universities have obligations to the Bologna Process to ensure high standards. Science education in England has undergone significant changes over the centuries; facing challenges over that period, and still facing challenges to this day.

==History==
===Up to 1800===
Gillard (2011)&lt;ref name="Gillard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.educationengland.org.uk/history/index.html|title=Education in England: a brief history|author=Gillard, D.|date=2011|publisher=D. Gillard|accessdate=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; gives a documented account of science curriculum and education during this period. According to his work, the teaching of science in England dates back to at least [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain|Anglo-Saxon times]]. Gillard explains that the first schools in England (that are known of) were created by [[Augustine of Canterbury|St Augustine]] when he brought [[Christianity]] to England around the end of the sixth century—there were almost certainly schools in [[Roman Britain]] before St Augustine, but they did not survive after the Romans left. It is thought the first [[grammar school]] was established at [[Canterbury]] in 598 during the reign of [[Æthelberht of Kent|King Ethelbert]]. Gillard also mentions Bede's ''Ecclesiastical History'', here science (in the form of [[astronomy]]) was already part of the curriculum in the early schools of the 600s. As the founding of grammar schools spread from south to north of England, science education spread with it. Science as it is known today developed from two spheres of knowledge: [[natural philosophy]] and [[natural history]]. The former was associated with the reasoning and explanation of nature while the latter focused more on living things. Both strands of knowledge can be identified in a curriculum provided by a school in [[York]] run by [[Alcuin]] in the 770s and 780s.&lt;ref name="Gillard"/&gt; Subsequent [[Viking Age#England|Viking invasions]] of England interrupted the development of schools, but despite this, through the ages, education in England was provided by the church and grammar schools (which were linked to the church). The link between church and school started to change in the 1300s when schools independent of the church began to emerge. University education in England started in [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] in the 1100s (although there is evidence that [[University of Oxford|teaching began there in the 1000s]]). Like pre-university education, science at Oxford University was initially taught in the form of astronomy (as part of the [[quadrivium]]). The [[Renaissance]] spurred physical inquiry into nature which led to natural philosophy developing into [[physics]] and [[chemistry]], and natural history developing into [[biology]]; these three disciplines form [[natural science]], from which interdisciplinary fields (or at least their modern versions) that overlap two or all three branches of natural science develop. This emerging trend in physical inquiry do not appear to have been reflected in the science curriculum in schools at the time.&lt;ref name="Gillard"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Williams|first = R.|authorlink = Raymond Williams|title = The Long Revolution|publisher = Chatto &amp; Windus|year = 1961|isbn = 0-14-020762-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in universities, the changes to science education that were necessary as a result of the Renaissance occurred very slowly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===1800s===
Up until the 1800s there were only two stages of education: elementary and university. However, in the nineteenth century, elementary education began to divide into primary (still called elementary) and secondary education. Elementary schools were defined in law in England through a series of acts of parliament&lt;ref name="Gillard"/&gt; which made education compulsory and free for children up to the age of 11 (later increased to 12). There were six (and later seven) standards for children to pass;&lt;ref name="Gillard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Victorianschool"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianschool.co.uk/school%20history%20lessons.html|title=The Standards of Education in schools in England from 1872|author=Victorian School|date=2015|publisher=Paradox|accessdate=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Morrish"&gt;{{cite book|last = Morrish|first = I.|title = Education Since 1800|publisher = Routledge
|series = Routledge Library Editions: History of Education|year = 2007|isbn = 978-1-134-53251-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; science education did not feature in any of these standards, but for some schools it was an ''add-on'' especially at the higher standards (such as sixth and seventh—science subjects included physics, chemistry, mechanics).&lt;ref name="Morrish"/&gt; Promotion from one standard to the next was on merit and not age.&lt;ref name="Victorianschool"/&gt; Not all children completed all standards, which meant that by the age of 12, there were children that had not ‘completed’ their elementary education.&lt;ref name="Victorianschool"/&gt; Of course families that could afford (and wanted) to keep their children in school post-compulsory age to pass all standards did so. In fact some children stayed in school beyond the seventh standard. Schools that offered post-seventh standard education became known as ''higher grade schools'', of which science education was a recognised feature of their curricula.&lt;ref name="Gillard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Morrish"/&gt;

====Taunton Report 1868====
This was by far the single most important development for science education in schools in England in the nineteenth century from a [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British parliament]] point of view. Ironically the original purpose of the committee that authored the 'Taunton' Report of 1868, or more formally, ''Volume II Miscellaneous Papers of the Schools Inquiry Commission'' (1868), was to examine how best [[Endowed Schools Act 1869|endowed schools]] should be managed; something Parliament at the time thought was of utmost importance.&lt;ref name="Taunton"&gt;{{cite book|last = Schools Inquiry Commission|title = Vol II: Miscellaneous Papers|publisher = HMSO|year = 1868}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee for the report was chaired by [[Henry Labouchere, 1st Baron Taunton|Lord Taunton (born Henry Labouchere)]]. In heading the preparation for the report, Lord Taunton sent a circular letter listing four questions to a number of prominent people in different parts of England on 28 May 1866; the first three were endowment-related issues, but the fourth question was on how to encourage a due supply of qualified teachers. Apart from the contents page, the word "science" first appears on page 45 of the report in a reply by one of the recipients of the circular letter; that recipient was Reverend W C Lake. The reverend comments:
:The question as to the best mode to be adopted for obtaining teachers both in sufficient numbers, and of the kind desirable for middle-class, education, seems to me more difficult than it would at first appear. ... you want men with an University culture, and yet not with exactly an University education ... You do not, I presume, want them to teach Greek; and as to Latin it ought not, in my opinion at least, to be the staple work of the school compared with arithmetic, some mathematics, modern languages, and history, and the principles of some important branches of physical science.
::::::::(Rev. Lake's reply to Lord Taunton IN Report by Schools Inquiry Commission, 1868: p45&lt;ref name="Taunton"/&gt;)
On page 77 of the report, Edward Twisleton, a member of the Schools Inquiry Commission, comments on the answers provided to the four questions set by the committee's chairman, Lord Taunton, based on feedback from the circular letter sent. To the first question, Twisleton writes:
:In providing,—what is generally a part of the arrangements of Prussian gymnasia—a museum of natural history and a cabinet with the philosophical instruments and other materials requisite for instruction in the experimental sciences. The Prussian system should be followed, in which two hours of each week are devoted throughout the school to lessons in these branches of knowledge; the instruction in the lower classes being in sciences of pure observation, such, as zoology and botany, while in the upper parts of the school instruction is given in the sciences usually called experimental, such as pneumatics, hydrostatics, and others. This system, however, cannot be adopted, unless there is a certain preliminary outlay of money, and it seems unobjectionable that this money should come from an endowment.
::::::::::::(Twisleton's response IN Report by Schools Inquiry Commission, 1868: p77&lt;ref name="Taunton"/&gt;)
There were noticeable opinions on the issue of science education from contributors that wrote to the committee to express their views. One by Robert Mosley of Holgate Seminary, York (pages 104 to 105 of the report), suggested the inclusion of physical sciences in a 'National education'; this national education being the best way to utilise educational endowment. Based on feedback from contributors, the Taunton Committee gave several arguments in favour of science education; two of them are:
*''As providing the best discipline in observation and collection of facts, in the combination of inductive with deductive reasoning, and in accuracy both of thought and language.'' 
and
*''Because the methods and results of science have so profoundly affected all the philosophical thought of the age, that an educated man is under a very great disadvantage if he is unacquainted with them.''
:::::::::::::::::::(Report by Schools Inquiry Commission, 1868: p219&lt;ref name="Taunton"/&gt;)
The committee subsequently made several recommendations; the first three on promoting scientific education in schools are listed below:
:i. That in all schools natural science be one of the subjects to be taught, and that in every public school at least one natural science master be appointed for the purpose.
:ii. That at least three hours a week be devoted to such scientific instruction.
:iii. That natural science should be placed on an equal footing with mathematics and modern languages in effecting promotions and in winning honours and prizes.
:::::::::::::::::::(Report by Schools Inquiry Commission, 1868: p222&lt;ref name="Taunton"/&gt;)
The issue of increased cost for fee payers played heavily on the minds of the committee, and although the committee felt that for "a wealthy country like England" (page 219 of the report), a slight increase in cost should not be a barrier to science education, it was left to individual schools to decide how to incorporate science into their curricula.

====Red brick universities====
By the time of the Taunton Report there were four universities in England (Oxford, [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], [[Durham University|Durham]] and [[University of London|London]]), but from the 1880s, a new wave of universities / university colleges completely separate from the original four began to emerge; these universities were called [[Red brick university|red brick]] universities. The first of these universities was established in [[Manchester]] in 1880 and was called [[Victoria University (United Kingdom)|Victoria University]]. Over the subsequent 80 years, a further 11 universities outside London, Cambridge, Durham and Oxford were founded, significantly expanding the availability of university (science) education throughout England. All through the 1800s, science was becoming increasingly specialised into the different areas we know today.

===1900s===
The Education Act 1902 led to the higher grade schools (alluded to earlier) and fee-paying schools being absorbed into the legally defined “higher education” (meaning any education that was not elementary (as primary education was known at the time)).&lt;ref name="Gillard"/&gt; Despite science education in higher grade schools and the recommendations of the Taunton Report, as well as the [[British Science Association|British Association for the Advancement of Science’s]] campaign for a science curriculum, science was still seen as a minor subject by the most prestigious public schools.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt; The problem was that most of these public schools had close relationships with Oxford and Cambridge universities which offered the majority of their scholarships in classics, and so science was regarded in low importance&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt; by the prestigious schools. Consequently, science education varied significantly across English schools. Numerous education-related acts were passed throughout the twentieth century, but the most important in the history of science education in England was the [[Education Reform Act 1988]] (see next subsection). Another act of importance to the development of science education below university-level in England was the Education Act 1944.&lt;ref name="EA1944"&gt;{{cite book|title = Education Act 1944 c31|publisher = HMSO|year = 1944}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1944 act's contribution was indirect though—it raised the compulsory school age to 15, but made provisions for it to be raised to 16 at a future date&lt;ref name="EA1944"/&gt;—which happened in 1972 (which is still the case today). By raising the school leaving age to 16, this formed the [[#Science education in England|basis for creating a nationally organised science curriculum and education in England]]. However, the 1944 Education Act did not stipulate that science be taught.&lt;ref name="EA1944"/&gt; For university-level science education, two significant developments were the expansion of [[Distance education|distance learning]] science courses&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.open.ac.uk/researchprojects/historyofou/story/early-curriculum|title=Early curriculum|author=Open University|date=2017|publisher=Open University|accessdate=26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the introduction of the [[World Wide Web]] (via the [[Internet]]) into the delivery of science teaching, although this has also been adopted below university-level.

====Education Reform Act 1988====
This was the most important development in the history of science education in England. It was this act that established the National Curriculum and made science compulsory across both secondary and primary schools (alongside [[Mathematics|maths]] and [[English language|English]]).&lt;ref name="ERA1988"/&gt; The 1988 act in effect implemented the recommendation of the Taunton Committee made more than a century earlier. The act also established the now familiar “key stages”.&lt;ref name="ERA1988"/&gt;

===2000s===
The most significant developments to the science curriculum and education in this period to date have been the [[#Changes to GCSE science and its grading system|expansion of the compulsory science content in the National Curriculum and the associated changes to its assessment]]. Another significant event was the passing of the [[Education and Skills Act 2008]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2008/25/contents|title=Education and Skills Act 2008|publisher=legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which raised the education leaving age in England to 18. It is unclear whether this extension of compulsory education will result in more science learners as science is not compulsory after the age of 16—the school leaving age, which the 2008 act did not alter.

==Compulsory science content and national assessments==
===Learning aims===
Compulsory science content is provided by the National Curriculum and generally applies to children between the ages of 5 and 16. These eleven years of compulsory education are divided by the state into four key stages: KS1, KS2, KS3 and KS4. Regardless of key stage, the National Curriculum states two overarching aims of science education:&lt;ref name="KS1and2"&gt;{{cite book|last = Department for Education|authorlink = Department for Education|title = Science programmes of study: key stages 1 and 2 – National curriculum in England|publisher = Department for Education|series = Programmes of study by subject|year = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KS3"&gt;{{cite book|last = Department for Education|authorlink = Department for Education|title = Science programmes of study: key stages 3 – National curriculum in England|publisher = Department for Education|series = Programmes of study by subject|year = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KS4"&gt;{{cite book|last = Department for Education|authorlink = Department for Education|title = Science programmes of study: key stages 4 – National curriculum in England|publisher = Department for Education|series = Programmes of study by subject|year = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* develop scientific knowledge and conceptual understanding through the specific disciplines of biology, chemistry and physics
* develop understanding of the nature, processes and methods of science through different types of science enquiries that help them to answer scientific questions about the world around them
A third aim is common to KS1–3:
* ''are equipped with the scientific knowledge required to understand the uses and implications of science, today and for the future.''
But for KS4, the third aim is far more detailed, and there is also a fourth aim:
* ''develop and learn to apply observational, practical, modelling, enquiry, problem-solving skills and mathematical skills, both in the laboratory, in the field and in other environments;''
* ''develop their ability to evaluate claims based on science through critical analysis of the methodology, evidence and conclusions, both qualitatively and quantitatively.''
The need for mathematical skills is stressed by the National Curriculum across all key stages, but more so at KS3 and KS4.

===Pedagogical considerations===
The National Curriculum for science is a [[spiral curriculum]]; it is also prescriptive. Because of its spiral nature, this makes its learning essentially [[Constructivism (philosophy of education)|constructivist]]. These points are illustrated in the subsections that follow. In addition, the Science National Curriculum emphasises the need for [[active learning]] right from the child’s earliest exposure to the curriculum. Research on the value of active learning has been demonstrated and published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freeman|first1=S.|last2=Eddy|first2=S.L.|last3=McDonough|first3=M.|last4=Smith|first4=M.K.|last5=Okoroafor|first5=N.|last6=Jordt|first6=H.|last7=Wenderoth|first7=M.P.|year=2014|title=Active learning increases student performance in science, engineering, and mathematics|journal=PNAS|volume=111|issue=23|pages=8410–5|publisher=National Academy of Sciences|doi=10.1073/pnas.1319030111|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/111/23/8410|accessdate=10 August 2017 |pmc=4060654}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experimentation by the child is underscored in the curriculum accompanied by careful discussion of what was observed. Despite these positive features, it has been argued that evaluating the effectiveness of the National Curriculum on learning is difficult to answer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bera.ac.uk/blog/how-do-you-measure-a-national-curriculum|title=How do you measure a national curriculum?|author=Wyse, D.|date=27 July 2015|work=The BERA Blog: Research Matters|publisher=British Educational Research Association|accessdate=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===KS1===
Key stage 1 (KS1) covers the first two years of compulsory school education in the National Curriculum. As such, the years are referred to as years 1 and 2. Children are typically in the age range 5–7. The emphasis of science at this stage is observation and describing or drawing things that the child can see, either around them or from a book or photograph or video; the feel of materials is also an important feature of KS1 science. Abstract concepts in science are not introduced at this stage (at least not on the basis of the National Curriculum). As a result, the science curriculum at KS1 is more or less plants and animals, and materials, with the emphasis on what can easily be seen or described by feeling things.&lt;ref name="KS1and2"/&gt;

===KS2 (including SATs, 11+ CEs, and teacher assessments)===
Key stage 2 (KS2) covers years 3, 4, 5 and 6 of compulsory school education in the National Curriculum. It is the longest stage of compulsory school education in England. Children are typically in the age range 7–11. The National Curriculum divides KS2 into lower KS2 (years 3 and 4) and upper KS2 (years 5 and 6). Year 3 continues from KS1, but more complex observations for the child to do on plants and animals, and materials—rocks, fossils and soils, are brought in. Setting up simple experiments and recording data become increasingly important at this stage. Hazards and dangers of certain scientific experiments (such as feeling things after they have been heated) are drilled into pupils; necessary precautions against such dangers/hazards are taught. New areas are introduced: light (and the dangers of looking directly at sunlight with necessary precautions), forces and magnets. In year 4, classification of living and non-living things come to the fore; additional areas introduced include:&lt;ref name="KS1and2"/&gt;
* Environmental change
* Digestive system and food chains
* States of matter
* Sound
* Electricity
In years 5 and 6 (upper KS2), the National Curriculum states that the emphasis should be on enabling pupils develop a deeper understanding of scientific ideas. The need to read, spell and pronounce scientific vocabulary correctly is emphasised by the National Curriculum. This emphasis probably reflects the fact that by the age of 9, 10 or 11, a child in England should be able to read and write properly. Year 5 continues on from year 4; studying increasingly more complex aspects of what was introduced in year 4. Also the pupil starts to learn about accepting or ''refuting'' ideas based on scientific evidence.&lt;ref name="KS1and2"/&gt; Additional areas include:
* Life cycles
* Reproduction in some plants and animals
* Growing old
* Properties and changes of materials
* Earth and space
Year 6 not only continues on from year 5, adding more complex aspects of what was learnt in year 5, but also prepares the pupil for KS3 science; additional areas include:
* Circulatory system
* Drugs and lifestyle
* Evolution and inheritance

====SATs and teacher assessments====
Between the early 1990s and early 2010s, state school pupils had to take statutory [[National Curriculum assessment|SAT exams]] at the end of KS2 science although [[National Curriculum assessment|teacher assessments]] were also allowed. The KS2 SAT science exam consisted of two papers (forty-five minutes each).&lt;ref name="SAT KS2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satspapers.org.uk/Page.aspx?TId=5|title=KS2 Year 6 SATs Papers|author=SatsPapers.org.uk|date=2017|publisher=SatsPapers.org.uk 
|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scores from both papers were combined to give a final score. This score would then be converted into a ''numerical'' level, which would in turn be converted into an ''expectation'' level. The conversion scale for the levels at KS2 SAT science is shown in the table below.

''Science KS2 SATs''&lt;ref name="SAT KS2"/&gt;
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;margin:0px;"

|-
|20–22 ||2
|-
|23–39 ||3
|-
|40–60 ||4 ||At expected level
|-
|61–80 ||5 ||Beyond expectations
|}

Level 6 (exceptional) was also available, but only in mathematics and English (reading); a separate test for level 6 assessment had to be taken, which had to be marked externally. Science KS2 SATs were discontinued in 2013 and replaced by teacher assessments (which were already allowed during the time of SATs). In addition to teacher assessments, a SAT replacement assessment called ''key stage 2 science sampling test'' is now offered to five randomly selected pupils in a school every two years. The test comprises three papers: ‘b’ for biology, ‘c’ for chemistry, and ‘p’ for physics (each twenty-five minutes). The aim of the tests is to assess how well children are getting on with the curriculum. The first test of this kind was in the summer of 2016.&lt;ref name="SAT KS2"/&gt;

====11+ CEs (Common Entrance Examination)====
This exam is taken by KS2 pupils wishing to be admitted into independent senior schools for KS3 study and higher (although not all senior schools admit 11-year-olds). The exam is typically taken while the pupil is in prep school, although some state school pupils use the exam to make the transition to an independent school. The syllabus for the 11+ CE science exam&lt;ref name="ISEB"&gt;{{cite book|last = Independent Schools Examinations Board|authorlink = Independent Schools Examinations Board|title = Common Entrance Examination at 11+ and 13+: Science Syllabus|publisher = Independent Schools Examinations Board|year = 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is based on the National Curriculum for KS2 science;&lt;ref name="KS1and2"/&gt; one paper for science (one hour) is taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iseb.co.uk/Schools/Examination-syllabuses-specimen-papers/Common-Entrance-at-11|title=Examination syllabuses &amp; specimen papers|author=Independent Schools Examinations Board|date=2017|publisher=ISEB|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the examinable syllabus for the 11+ CE, there is also prep-KS3 science material for the pupil to cover;&lt;ref name="ISEB"/&gt; this prep-KS3 science material is not examinable, but is required as preparation for KS3 science study in senior school if admitted.

===The ‘traditional’ three sciences for KS3 and KS4===
The National Curriculum for KS3–4 science differs from KS1–2 not just in its complexity, but unlike the latter, the science curriculum is divided into three explicit parts: biology, chemistry and physics. Typically in a state secondary school there can be anything from one to up to three (or even more) teachers delivering science to a single class (depending on the breadth of knowledge of the teacher and staff resources of the school). Broadly speaking, similar areas are covered at both stages (that is KS3 and KS4), but at a more advanced level in KS4. Below is a broad (and simplified) summary of the curriculum of each part at KS3/4 level.&lt;ref name="KS3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KS4"/&gt;

====Biology====
Defined in the National Curriculum as:
:''... the science of living organisms (including animals, plants, fungi and microorganisms) and their interactions with each other and the environment.''
The content for KS3/4 biology in the National Curriculum is broadly:
* Cell biology and organisation
* Body systems (vary between KS3 and KS4)
* Biochemistry
* Health, disease and medicines
* Photosynthesis
* Ecosystem
* Genetics and inheritance
* Variation within and between species, and evolution

====Chemistry====
Defined in the National Curriculum as:
:''... the science of the composition, structure, properties and reactions of matter, understood in terms of atoms, atomic particles and the way they are arranged and link together.''
The content for KS3/4 chemistry in the National Curriculum is broadly:
* Atoms, elements, mixtures, compounds and the particulate nature of matter
* The periodic table and periodicity
* Properties of matter
* Chemical reactions and changes
* Chemical analysis
* Energetics
* Materials (both natural and synthetic)
* Earth and atmosphere

====Physics====
Defined in the National Curriculum as:
:''... the science of the fundamental concepts of field, force, radiation and particle structures, which are inter-linked to form unified models of the behaviour of the material universe.''
The content for KS3/4 physics in the National Curriculum is broadly:
* Energy
* Forces and motion
* Waves (including sound and light) and electromagnetic waves (KS4)
* Electricity, magnetism and electromagnetism
* Physical nature of matter
* Particle model of matter
* Atomic structure (and radioactivity (KS4))
* Space physics (not always covered at KS4; depends on the GCSE exam board)

===KS3 (including SATs, 13+ CEs, and teacher assessments)===
Key stage 3 (KS3) covers years 7, 8 and 9 of compulsory school education in the National Curriculum. Pupils are typically in the age range 11–14.

====SATs and teacher assessments====
Between the early 1990s and late 2000s (‘late noughties’) state school pupils had to take statutory SAT exams at the end of KS3 science (just like KS2), although teacher assessments were also allowed. The KS3 SAT science exam consisted of two papers (one hour each). The scores from both papers were combined to give a final score. This score would then be converted into a numerical level, which would in turn be converted into an expectation level. The conversion scale for the levels at KS3 SAT is shown below.
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;margin:0px;"

The conversion of the raw score from the two papers to a numerical level depended on the ‘tier’ taken by the student. For science KS3 SATs, two tiers were available: lower tier and higher tier. Levels 3–6 were available at the lower tier while levels 5–7 were available at the higher tier. The conversion scale for each tier’s scores are shown below.

Level 8 (exceptional) was not available to science KS3 SATs (not even at the higher tier); it was available to mathematics, but only at the highest tier (levels 6–8) out of four tiers that were available to mathematics KS3 SATs. Science KS3 SATs were discontinued in 2010 and replaced by teacher assessments (just like science KS2 SATs). Despite the discontinuation of statutory science KS3 SATs, the past papers are still used by schools today.&lt;ref name="SAT KS3"/&gt;

====13+ CEs (Common Entrance Examination)====
Like the 11+ CEs, the 13+ CEs are taken by pupils wishing to be admitted to independent senior schools; in this case for KS4 study and higher. The exam is typically taken while the pupil is in prep school (some senior schools only admit from the age of 13). Some state school pupils use the exam to make the transition to an independent school. The syllabus for the 13+ CE science exam(s)&lt;ref name="ISEB"/&gt; is based on the National Curriculum for KS3 science,&lt;ref name="KS3"/&gt; although not all of the KS3 science content is examinable in the CE, but the parts left out are recommended for teaching in year 9.&lt;ref name="ISEB"/&gt; For the exam the candidate can take either the simpler one paper in science (one hour) comprising biology, chemistry and physics parts, or three higher (and harder) papers (forty minutes each)—one in biology, one in chemistry, and one in physics.&lt;ref name="ISEB"/&gt; In addiion, individual senior schools may have exams for entry into other years; for example, 14+, 16+ (for [[Key Stage 5|post-16 or ‘KS5’]] study); details of which they give on their websites.

===KS4 (including GCSEs)===
Key stage 4 (KS4) covers years 10 and 11 of compulsory school education, but it may start earlier for science (and mathematics) in some schools. Pupils are typically in the age range 14–16. At the end of KS4, students have to take statutory GCSE exams, which can be taken at either foundation tier or higher tier. Science GCSEs can be complicated in that they offer a vast array of ‘routes’ although this has simplified somewhat following recent changes to GCSEs.&lt;ref name="WHSmith"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.whsmith.co.uk/changes-to-the-national-curriculum-in-england-2015/|title=Changes to the National Curriculum in England|author=WHSmith|date=29 July 2017|work=WHSmith Blog|publisher=WHSmith|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aqa.org.uk/subjects/science/gcse/combined-science-trilogy-8464|title=GCSE Combined Science: Trilogy|author=AQA|date=2017|publisher=AQA|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/demo/en/qualifications/edexcel-gcses/science-2011-mixed.html|title=Edexcel GCSE: Science - Mixed science route (2011)|author=Pearson|date=2017|publisher=Pearson Education|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Edexcel2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/demo/en/qualifications/edexcel-gcses/sciences-2016.html|title=Edexcel GCSE: Sciences (2016)|author=Pearson|date=2017|publisher=Pearson Education|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today science GCSE can be taken either as a combined single subject (which is worth two GCSEs) or as the three separate subjects of physics, chemistry and biology, (each worth a single GCSE in its own right). When biology, chemistry and physics are taken as separate GCSE subjects the tiers can be mixed. So for instance, a student could take say, biology at higher tier, but chemistry at foundation tier. By contrast, tiers cannot be mixed in combined science (that is, all constituent parts must be taken at the same tier).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Edexcel|authorlink = Edexcel|title = Pearson Edexcel Level 1/Level 2 GCSE (9-1) in Combined Science – Specification|publisher = Pearson Education|year = 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = OCR|authorlink = Oxford, Cambridge and RSA Examinations|title = GCSE (9–1) in Combined Science A (Gateway Science)|publisher = OCR|year = 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments (also called ''practicals'') are compulsory in the GCSE science course, but in different ways across the boards offering GCSE science to English schools. For most boards the results of the practicals do not count towards the final grade in the reformed GCSE (as this is determined entirely by the results of the written examination), but the school/college must submit a signed ''practical science statement'' to the board under which the science is being studied BEFORE the students can take the examination. The statement must declare that all students have completed all the required practicals. The skills and knowledge that should have been acquired from the practicals are subsequently assessed in the GCSE exams, which for most boards are entirely written (as alluded to earlier). For one board ([[Council for the Curriculum, Examinations &amp; Assessment|CCEA]]) however, in addition to the examination of practical skills in the written papers, the results of some of the actual practicals do count towards the final grade in the reformed GCSE. Currently, GCSE sciences in England are available from five boards: [[Assessment and Qualifications Alliance|AQA]], [[Oxford, Cambridge and RSA Examinations|OCR]], [[Edexcel]]. [[Eduqas|WJEC-Eduqas]] and CCEA. Although all five boards provide GCSE science to English schools, not all of these boards are based in England: AQA, OCR and Edexcel are based in England, but WJEC-Eduqas is based in Wales, while CCEA is based in Northern Ireland. Schools are free to choose any board for their science, and where the three sciences of chemistry, physics and biology are being taken independently at GCSE level, all three sciences need not be taken from the same board. Some boards offer multiple routes for their combined science courses in the reformed GCSE in England.

====AQA combined science====
Following recent changes, a student can go for one of two routes if taking AQA combined science: ''trilogy'' or ''synergy''.&lt;ref name="AQA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aqa.org.uk/subjects/science/gcse|title=GCSE Science: Specifications|author=AQA|date=2017|publisher=AQA|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In trilogy, science is delivered in the three traditional parts of biology, chemistry and physics. The trilogy specification document [http://www.aqa.org.uk/subjects/science/gcse] outlines topics for each science part and practicals are specified. The trilogy GCSE exam itself is made up of six papers (each one hour and fifteen minutes): two for biology, two for chemistry, and two for physics. In synergy, science is delivered in two parts: ''life and environmental sciences'' AND ''physical sciences''. Unlike trilogy, each of the two parts in the synergy specification document [http://www.aqa.org.uk/subjects/science/gcse] is broken down into ‘areas’ that enable biology, chemistry and physics to sit together. The synergy GCSE exam itself is made up of four papers (each one hour and forty-five minutes): two for life and environmental sciences and two for physical sciences.

====OCR combined science====
Like AQA combined science, following recent changes, a student can go for one of two routes if taking OCR combined science; in this case either ''combined science A'' or ''combined science B''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ocr.org.uk/qualifications/by-subject/science/|title=OCR: Science|author=OCR|date=2017|publisher=2017|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In combined science A, science is delivered in the three traditional parts of biology, chemistry and physics. Like AQA's trilogy, each science part is broken into topics in combined science A's specification document [http://www.ocr.org.uk/qualifications/gcse-gateway-science-suite-combined-science-a-j250-from-2016/], but unlike AQA combined science, practicals are suggested rather than specified, although practicals are still compulsory (the same goes for combined science B). The GCSE combined science A exam is made up of six papers (each one hour and ten minutes): two each for biology, chemistry and physics respectively. In combined science B, the science curriculum is delivered in four parts: biology, chemistry, physics and combined science. Each part is broken into topics in the combined science B specification document [http://www.ocr.org.uk/qualifications/gcse-twenty-first-century-science-suite-combined-science-b-j260-from-2016/]. The exam itself is made up of four papers (each one hour and forty-five minutes): one each for biology, chemistry, physics and combined science respectively.

====Combined science from Edexcel or WJEC–Eduqas====
Following the changes to GCSEs, only one route is available to the student that takes Edexcel or Eduqas combined science.&lt;ref name="Edexcel2016"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eduqas.co.uk/qualifications/combined-science/index.html|title=GCSE (9-1) Combined Science|author=Eduqas|date=2017|publisher=WJEC CBAC|accessdate=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Edexcel's combined science specification document [https://qualifications.pearson.com/en/qualifications/edexcel-gcses/sciences-2016.html] the curriculum is delivered in the three traditional disciplines of biology, chemistry and physics, but in Eduqas's [http://www.eduqas.co.uk/qualifications/combined-science/index.html], the science curriculum is divided into four parts: ''Concepts in Biology'', '' Concepts in Chemistry'', ''Concepts in Physics'' and ''Applications in Science''. The Eduqas combined science exam is made up of four papers (one hour and forty-five minutes each): one for each of the three 'Concepts in ...' and one for 'Applications in Science'. The Edexcel exam is made up of six papers (each one hour and ten minutes): two each for biology, chemistry and physics respectively.

====New double award science from CCEA====
The new combined science from CCEA since the GCSE reforms retains the same name as its predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccea.org.uk/general_science/|title=GCSE Double Award Science: For first teaching from September 2017|author=Council for the Curriculum, Examinations &amp; Assessment|date=2015|publisher=CCEA|accessdate=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The specification document [http://ccea.org.uk/general_science/] presents the science curriculum in the traditional disciplines of biology, chemistry and physics. The exam is the most extensive of the GCSE science boards; made up of nine papers and three practical exams. For each of biology, chemistry and physics there are three papers and one practical exam: Paper 1 is one hour long, Paper 2 is one hour and fifteen minutes, Paper 3 is a practical skills paper and is thirty minutes long, and the practical exam is one hour long.

====Changes to GCSE science and its grading system====
As alluded to earlier, in the mid-2010s, the GCSE science courses of the GCSE exam boards underwent significant changes. This was in part due to changes in the National Curriculum, of which one of the areas affected the most was key stage 4 (KS4). The revised version of the National Curriculum covered more content;&lt;ref name="WHSmith"/&gt; the one for KS4 science was published in December 2014 and a version specifically for GCSE combined science was published in June 2015,&lt;ref name="GCSE"&gt;{{cite book|last = Department for Education|authorlink = Department for Education|title = Combined science: GCSE subject content|publisher = Department for Education|series = GCSE subject content|year = 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and implemented in September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/get-the-facts-gcse-and-a-level-reform/get-the-facts-gcse-reform|title=Get the facts: GCSE reform|author=Ofqual|publisher=gov.uk|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increased content triggered a change in the GCSE grading system from A*–G to 9–1. Much more detail on the new grading system and how it differs from the previous can be read [[General Certificate of Secondary Education|here]]. One consequence of the increased science content in the National Curriculum was that it helped simplify a bewildering array of GCSE science courses particularly from AQA, which are/were designed to accommodate students from the least able to the most able.&lt;ref name="AQA"/&gt; AQA science courses such as core science, additional science, further additional science, science A, science B, additional applied science illustrate the variety.&lt;ref name="AQA"/&gt; The new trilogy and synergy courses (which were developed from the recently expanded National Curriculum for science) have removed the need for the most able students to take multiple science courses&lt;ref name="AQA"/&gt; unless the student decides to take chemistry, biology and physics individually. The content for GCSE physics as a stand-alone subject is more than the content for physics in GCSE combined science. For instance, in the National Curriculum for KS4 science,&lt;ref name="KS4"/&gt; space physics is included, but not in the GCSE combined science version.&lt;ref name="GCSE"/&gt; AQA includes space physics in its GCSE specification,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = AQA|authorlink = Assessment and Qualifications Alliance|title = GCSE Physics (8463). For exams 2018 onwards. Version 1.0|publisher = AQA}}&lt;/ref&gt; but only when GCSE physics is taken as an independent subject in its own right, and not when physics is taken as part of GCSE combined science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = AQA|authorlink = Assessment and Qualifications Alliance|title = GCSE Combined Science: Trilogy (8464). For exams 2018 onwards. Version 1.0|publisher = AQA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science education post-16 or ‘KS5’==
For the ages of 16, 17 and 18 (and older for those that remain in education below university-level), students in England do what is sometimes loosely called ‘key stage 5’ or KS5; it has no legal meaning (unlike the other key stages). And unlike KS1–4 in which the levels of complexity of topics learnt at each stage are [[#Compulsory science content and national assessments|prescribed within relatively narrow limits]], at KS5, the levels of complexity of topics cover a wide range, although the highest level of complexity at KS5 is [[National qualifications frameworks in the United Kingdom|RQF level 3]]. Whether or not a student actually studies at this level of complexity in KS5 depends on his/her GCSE results—crucially on what subjects the student obtained passes at RQF level 2 standard (including mathematics and English) as well as the actual grades themselves. In other words, unlike KS1–4, where a specific student studies at one RQF level, at KS5, a specific student may be studying at several RQF levels depending on what s/he obtained at GCSEs. Regardless of the RQF-level mix, a KS5 student can do his/her post-16 study in one of the following:
* School with a [[sixth form]]
* [[Sixth form college#England|Stand-alone sixth form college]]
* [[Further education|Further education college]]
* [[Apprenticeship]]
* Traineeship

This can be done either full-time or part-time. If done part-time, the student also has to be working or volunteering for at least 20 hours a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/know-when-you-can-leave-school|title=School leaving age|author=Gov.uk|work=Education and learning: Schools and curriculum|publisher=Gov.uk|accessdate=26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As already hinted, the science curriculum and education at KS5 is highly varied, often disparate and tends to be specialised as students in their late teens interested in science begin to study subjects that will prepare them for science careers. In KS5 study at RQF level 3, students are introduced to concepts they would never have heard of during their time from KS1 to KS4, which they will either study in much greater depth at university-level (if s/he continues to study the science in question) or apply at [[Vocational education|vocational]] placements or [[apprenticeship]]s. Practical science at KS5–RQF level 3 can be more extensive. Individual A levels in chemistry, biology and physics are perhaps the best known KS5–RQF level 3 science subjects (and they take two years to complete when done full-time), but A level students may well choose only one or two of these subjects, and mix with mathematics or non-science A level subjects depending on what university degree the student wishes to study post-KS5 (typically A level students go straight to university on successful completion of A levels). Although A levels are probably the highest profile KS5 studies, there are other qualifications&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/education/key-stage-5-exam-marking-qualifications-and-results|title=Key stage 5 exam marking, qualifications and results|author=Gov.uk|publisher=gov.uk|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; students can take as alternatives. KS5 science subjects (including [[Laboratory|laboratory science]]) can also be taken in [[Business and Technology Education Council|BTECs]], [[Cambridge Pre-U]]s, [[International Baccalaureate|IBs]], AQAs (non-A levels), OCRs (non-A levels). [[National Vocational Qualification|NVQs]], [[Foundation programme|university specific foundation year programmes]] (generally offered to students that have taken A levels, but not the correct ones; can also be offered to those that have failed their A levels), [[Access to Higher Education|access to HEs]] (generally not available to students under 21). Although all these alternative non-A level qualifications (which are all available at RQF level 3) can offer content similar in complexity to their A/AS level counterparts (which are also RQF level 3), the make-up of their content can vary significantly depending on the subject, and the board offering it. A comprehensive list of most subjects at most levels and the boards offering them is kept by the [[National Careers Service]] and individual subjects and their boards can be searched for on their website [https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/course-directory/home]. A search tool for only Ofqual approved list of subjects and their boards can be found at ''Ofqual: The Register''[https://register.ofqual.gov.uk/]; the list can also be downloaded from the site, while a search tool for only QAA approved access to HE subjects can be found at ''Access to Higher Education''[http://www.accesstohe.ac.uk/Pages/Default.aspx]. Both the National Careers Service and Ofqual lists include all A/AS levels, GCSEs (RQF levels 1–2) and most of the rest (RQF levels 1–8, and the RQF entry level (which is below RQF level 1)). With regards to universities in England accepting RQF level 3 science subjects for their science degrees, students with only non-A level science subjects may be accepted, or the student may require a mixture of some of these non-A level science subjects with one or two A/AS level science subjects. This all depends on the level 3 qualification in question, the university, and science degree the student wishes to study. Individual universities give details of their entry requirements for their various science (and obviously all) degrees on their websites. Some RQF level 3 students may use the KS5 science subjects they study for entry into higher/degree apprenticeships or university-level vocational training.

===Adult returners to education===
{{Main|Adult learner}}
Beyond 18 years of age, students that have already either left or finished their formal education, but return at later times in their lives to study science (having decided they do not have the appropriate level of knowledge), can do so on their return at RQF level 3 or lower. The level the student returns at will depend on his/her pre-enrollment level of knowledge of science, although science is generally not available below RQF level 1 (that is, the RQF entry (sub-1) level) to adult returners to education (but maths and English are). Typically, further education colleges admit adult returners, although some universities may offer distance learning courses. Further education and distance learning courses are often the ways these [[Adult learner|mature students]] can access science courses long after they have left education. Just like students that have neither left nor previously finished their education, satisfactorily passing the summative assessment at RQF level 3 is the crucial gateway into university-level education (that is RQF level 4 and higher) in England. In addition to satisfactory passes in science subjects at RQF level 3, the learner also has to have passed mathematics and English at RQF level 2 standard (typically GCSEs or equivalent with minimum (or equivalent minimum) grades of 'C' or '4'); providers of university-level education give details on their websites.

==Science education at university-level==
Like post-16 or KS5, this is also highly varied, disparate and specialised, but more so, as a student may chose to study 'one' science, which s/he will subsequently study in depth for three or more years; the [[summative assessment]] leads to a [[Academic degree#England, Wales and Northern Ireland|degree]] (of which for science in England today is typically one of  two levels—RQF level 6 or 7). Such education will enable students market themselves as (specialist) scientists to employers or [[Postgraduate education|postgraduate]] science degree programmes (although the choices available to the graduate are affected by the [[Academic degree#United Kingdom|class of degree]] the graduate achieves—recruiters give details on their websites). Many concepts the student first encountered in A levels / RQF level 3 are dealt with in much greater detail. The biggest difference between A level / RQF level 3 science and university-level science occurs in physics, which at university-level becomes highly mathematical (and at times [[Mathematical physics|difficult to distinguish from mathematics]]). Practical science at university-level can be quite extensive and by the time of the [[Thesis|dissertation]] project, the student may well be doing complex experiments lasting weeks or months unsupervised (although s/he will still have a supervisor on hand). Science degrees in England are offered by both universities and some further education colleges. University-level teachers (also referred to in England as ''lecturers'') will teach one area of the science the student is studying, but two notable differences between university-level science education in further education colleges and universities are that in universities, there is a close connection between teaching and research. In other words, it is common for a university teacher to be a researcher in the area s/he teaches—this applies not just to science, but to all areas; such connection between teaching and research does not occur in further education colleges in England. And the other difference is that further education colleges must have their degrees approved by universities. Although universities do not need approval for their science degrees and are free to set their own content, they generally get many of their science courses accredited by professional bodies. So for example, universities offering biology degrees commonly get these programmes accredited by the [[Royal Society of Biology]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rsb.org.uk/education/accreditation/institutions/Accreditation|title=Degree accreditation programme|author=Royal Society of Biology|date=2017|publisher=Royal Society of Biology|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; for chemistry degrees, it is the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/Education/courses-and-careers/accredited-courses/|title=Accredited Degree Programmes|author=Royal Society of Chemistry|date=2017|work=Chemistry Courses and Careers|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry |accessdate=26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; for physics degrees, it is the [[Institute of Physics]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.iop.org/education/higher_education/accreditation/file_69855.pdf|title=Register of Accredited Courses|author=IOP: Institute of Physics|date=June 2017|publisher=Institute of Physics|accessdate=26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; for [[geology]] degrees, it is the [[Geological Society]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geolsoc.org.uk/accreditation|title=Accredited Degrees &amp; University Departments|author=Geological Society|date=2012|publisher=Geological Society of London|accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so on. Accreditation of a science degree by a professional body is a precondition if the student studying the degree is to become a member of the body following graduation, and subsequently acquire [[Chartered (professional)|chartered status]]. In addition, UK universities are obliged to ensure that their degrees meet the standards agreed to in the Bologna Process to which the UK is a co-signatory. The QAA [[Universities in the United Kingdom#Academic standards|certifies those British degrees that meet those standards]]. Not all university-level students studying science study for science degrees; many will study science as part of a vocational degree such as [[pharmacy]], [[medicine]], [[dentistry]], [[nursing]], [[veterinary medicine]], [[allied health professions]], and so on. And some will study science as part of a higher/degree apprenticeship.

==Challenges for science education in England==
The challenges of establishing a national curriculum for science below university-level in England over the last two centuries have been explored by Smith (2010)&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt; and others. In Smith's paper, she highlighted two potentially conflicting roles for science education below university-level: educating a public to be scientifically literate, and providing scientific training for aspiring science professionals. Smith further pointed out in her paper that even among the training of aspiring science professionals, three groups could be identified: those that sought science in pursuance of the truth and an abstract understanding of science; those that sought science for actual benefit to society—the applied scientists, and then the failures. The dilemma did not escape the committee led by [[J. J. Thomson|J J Thomson]] (discoverer of the [[electron]]) in 1918, which is quite telling of the tension in trying to accommodate several very different groups of science learners:
:In framing a course in Science for boys up to the age of 16 it should be recognised that for many this will be the main, for some the only, opportunity of obtaining a knowledge of Science, and that the course should therefore be self-contained, and designed so as to give special attention to those natural phenomena which are matters of everyday experience, in fine, that the Science taught in it should be kept as closely connected with human interests as possible.
:::::::::::::::::::::(Report by Thomson Committee, 1918: p23&lt;ref name="Thomson"&gt;{{cite book|last = Committee led by Thomson|first = J.J.|authorlink = J. J. Thomson|title = The Position of Natural Science: Educational System of Great Britain|publisher = HMSO|year = 1918}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
Such tension has never really dissipated.&lt;ref name="RS"&gt;{{cite book|last = Royal Society|first = The|authorlink = Royal Society
|title = A ‘state of the nation’ report 2008: Science and mathematics education, 14–19
|publisher = Royal Society|year = 2008|isbn = 978-0-85403-712-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a report by the Royal Society from 2008,&lt;ref name="RS"/&gt; they state several challenges facing science education; the first two are reproduced here:

The first:
:provide science and mathematics education appropriate for students of all levels of attainment in an environment where more students remain in education post-16;
and the second: 
:give a solid core grounding in science and mathematics to those who will probably not continue studying these subjects post-16;
::::::::::::::::::::::(Report by the Royal Society, 2008: p17&lt;ref name="RS"/&gt;)
A lack of good quality teachers has also been cited as a challenge.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thomson"/&gt; Difficulty recruiting science teachers, which is a current problem in England (and the UK as a whole) is certainly not new as the following extract from the report by the Thomson Committee in 1918 shows:
:The first and indispensable condition for any real improvement in the teaching of Science in schools of all kinds is that effective steps should be taken to secure an adequate supply of properly qualified teachers. The supply is inadequate for existing needs ...
:::::::::::::::::::::(Report by Thomson Committee, 1918: p31&lt;ref name="Thomson"/&gt;)
Some interesting figures were quoted in the 1918 report; for instance on page 31 of the report: out of 72 schools that had 200–400 girls of all ages, only 39 had the services of two science teachers (mistresses). The report went on state that these figures had contributed to long hours and inadequate salaries. This sounds strikingly similar to the situation facing science (and indeed all) school teachers in England today; a hundred years later. Another challenge was that there was not an appreciation by the political elite on the value of a science education to the wider public;&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt; despite the fact that England was producing some of the greatest scientists in the world. Yet another challenge was that [[#1900s|public schools were slow to respond to the needs of developing a science curriculum]]. For example, [[William Sharp (homeopath)|William Sharp]] was the first science teacher for [[Rugby School]], a prestigious public school in England, which only happened for the first time in 1847; nearly 300 years after the college was established and more than 100 years after England had lost one of the world’s greatest scientists—[[Isaac Newton]].&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=J.|year=2012|title=The scientific disciplines: what comes first among equals?|journal=School Science Review|volume=345|pages=109–116|publisher=Association for Science Education|url=https://www.ase.org.uk/journals/school-science-review/2012/6/345/3110/ssr-june-2012-109-115-williams.pdf|accessdate=22 August 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these challenges, a science curriculum and education developed through the twentieth century and eventually became a compulsory part of the new National Curriculum in 1988 (phased in from 1989 to 1992). Even at the time of the deliberations in the mid-1980s prior to the creation of the National Curriculum, there was disagreement over how much time science should occupy in the curriculum.&lt;ref name="Frost"&gt;{{cite book|last = Frost|first = J.|title = The Science Curriculum IN Learning to Teach Science in the Secondary School: A Companion to School (J. Frost &amp; T. Turner (Eds))|publisher = RoutledgeFalmer
|year = 2005|isbn = 0-415-28780-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was pressure for science to be made to occupy 20% of curriculum time for 14–16-year-olds, but not everyone agreed with this; certainly not the then [[Kenneth Baker, Baron Baker of Dorking|Secretary of State for Education and Science Kenneth Baker]].&lt;ref name="Frost"/&gt; The then Department for Education and Science settled for 12.5% of curriculum time, but schools were free to increase this. The result was the emergence of single science (which occupied 10% of curriculum time and was the minimum requirement—also called ''core'' science), double science (which occupied 20% of curriculum time, and was so called because it involved studying core science and ''additional'' science), and there was the option of doing the sciences of physics, chemistry and biology separately (also known as 'triple' science).&lt;ref name="Frost"/&gt; Following the changes to the National Curriculum in the 2010s, single science has effectively been removed, and the two components of double science have been combined to form 'combined science', which is now the minimum requirement. One challenge that ties in with England's shortage of science teachers is the number of science undergraduates in higher education, which provides the pool for future trainee science teachers,&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt; but undergraduate numbers affect the three sciences differently: the number of students that study physical sciences in higher education (93050 in the year 2012/13) are less than half the students that study biological sciences (201520 in the year 2012/13).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Universities UK &amp; HESA|authorlink = Universities UK|title = Patterns and Trends in UK Higher Education|publisher = Universities UK|series = Higher education in focus|year = 2014|isbn = 978-1-84036-330-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has had a direct impact on government policy in England; for example, the UK government offers [[Bursary|bursaries]] of £30000 to graduates with first class honours degrees wishing to train as physics teachers in secondary schools in England; for chemistry, the top bursary is £25000, and for biology it is £15000.&lt;ref name="bursary"&gt;{{cite web 
|url=https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/funding-and-salary/overview|title=Get Into Teaching: Bursaries and funding|author=Department for Education|accessdate=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For students with lower honours degrees in these subjects, correspondingly lower bursaries are offered, but they are still considerable for physics graduates (compared to bursaries offered to trainee teachers of other subjects).&lt;ref name="bursary"/&gt; For instance, a physics graduate with a lower second class honours degree can still attract a bursary of £25000. But the government has also implemented a policy to increase the number of science graduates from UK universities: normally a student in England wishing to study for a [[Undergraduate degree|first degree]] including an [[honours degree]] can get a [[Student loans in the United Kingdom|UK-government-backed student loan]] as long as s/he does not already possess an honours degree. Exceptions are permitted, but prior to September 2017 (and in the case of [[Postgraduate education|postgraduate master's degrees]], September 2016), these UK-government-backed loans for those in England that already had honours degrees were only available for them if the courses they were going to study led to professional qualifications such as medicine, dentistry, [[Social work|social care]], [[architecture]] or [[Teacher|teaching]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nus.org.uk/en/advice/money-and-funding/ive-already-got-a-uk-honours-degree--can-i-get-funding-for-more-higher-education/|title=I’ve already got a UK honours degree – can I get funding for more higher education?|author=National Union of Students|date=22 March 2013|publisher=National Union of Students|accessdate=17 September 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223075035/https://www.nus.org.uk/en/advice/money-and-funding/ive-already-got-a-uk-honours-degree--can-i-get-funding-for-more-higher-education/|archivedate=23 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the range of subjects for which a student in England already in possession of an honours degree could get a second UK-government-backed student loan to study a second honours degree was expanded to include science subjects (as well as [[technology]], [[engineering]] and mathematics), which took effect from 1 September 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.open.ac.uk/courses/fees-and-funding/equivalent-qualifications 
|title=Loans for degree holders in England|author=The Open University|date=2017|publisher=The Open University|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like before, the student has to meet both England and UK residency requirements [https://www.gov.uk/student-finance/who-qualifies]. The inclusion of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (collectively called "[[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM"]] subjects) to the list appears to have been triggered not just by teacher shortages in those subjects, but also by a general skills shortage (in those subjects) UK-wide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bennett|first1=M.|date=28 November 2016 
|title=What is the UK doing about its STEM skills shortfall?|journal=The Telegraph|publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/ready-and-enabled/stem-skills-shortfall/|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It remains to be seen whether the direct interventions by the UK government help alleviate the general skills shortages in STEM subjects, as well as the challenges of delivering a science curriculum and education in the long-term. As for universities, several challenges have been identified by Grove (2015);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/features/7-key-challenges-uk-higher-education#survey-answer|title=7 key challenges for UK higher education|author=Grove, J.|date=5 August 2015|work=Times Higher Education (THE): World University Rankings|publisher=Times Higher Education|accessdate=26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the summaries of those challenges have been reproduced below:
* Operating in a global market
* Rising student expectations (as a result of the increased loans [[Student loans in the United Kingdom#Tuition fee loan|students in England have to take to pay their increased tuition fees]])
* Increasing costs and shifting funding ([[Student loans in the United Kingdom#Maintenance grant|as the UK government provides less grants]] and students take on additional loans (on top of the increased tuition fee loans) to compensate)
* A demand and need for new technologies
* Linking estates, strategy and the student
* Attracting and retaining the best talent
* Making research sustainable

These challenges apply not just to the university provision of science education, but to all areas of university education.

'''Scientific dissent''' is [[dissent]] from [[scientific consensus]]. Disagreements can be useful for finding problems in underlying assumptions, methodologies, and reasoning, as well as for generating and testing new ways of tackling the unknown.&lt;ref name=immki&gt;de Melo‐Martín, I. and Intemann, K. (2013) [http://embor.embopress.org/content/14/3/231.short "Scientific dissent and public policy"]. ''EMBO Reports'', '''14''' (3): 231–235. {{doi|10.1038/embor.2013.8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern times, with the increased role of science on the society and the [[politicization of science]], a new aspect gained prominence: effects of scientific dissent on public policies.&lt;ref name=immki/&gt;

Scientific dissent is distinct from [[denialism]], which is a deliberate rejection of scientific consensus usually for commercial or ideological reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://eurpub.oxfordjournals.org/content/19/1/2 | title=Denialism: what is it and how should scientists respond? | author=Diethelm, Pascal | journal=The European Journal of Public Health | year=2009 | volume=19 | issue=1 | doi=10.1093/eurpub/ckn139 | pmid=19158101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific dissent as norm of scientific inquiry==
{{Main article|Scientific method|Scientific consensus}}
[[Miriam Solomon]] in her book ''Social Empiricism'' argues that scientific dissent is the normal state of [[scientific method|scientific inquiry]], rather than a conflict situation that needs resolution. She argues that disagreements of  individual scientists about the proper direction of research are not cause for concern, because scientific rationality must be assessed at the level of the scientific community.&lt;ref name=se2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wylie|first=Alison|title=A More Social Epistemology: Decision Vectors, Epistemic Fairness, and Consensus in Solomon’s Social Empiricism|journal=Perspectives on Science|date=2008|volume=16|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As long as all theories being pursued yield some unique empirical successes, Solomon argues that their pursuit is worthwhile and even consistent with the common view that science aims at truth.&lt;ref name=se1&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schmaus|first1=W.|title=Book Review: What's So Social about Social Knowledge?|journal=Philosophy of the Social Sciences|volume=35|issue=1|year=2005|pages=98–125|issn=0048-3931|doi=10.1177/0048393104271927}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Solomon's view, competing scientific theories can even be inconsistent with one another while each containing some degree of truth.&lt;ref name=se1/&gt;  Empirical evidence may not be sufficient to distinguish between competing theories, and successful theories often have core assumptions that are incorrect.&lt;ref name=se1/&gt;

===Historical scientific dissent===
A number of famous scientists have been sceptical of what were, or came to be, mainstream scientific positions. For example, [[Ernst Mach]] famously declared in 1897: "I don't believe that atoms exist!"&lt;ref&gt;John T. Blackmore, ''Ernst Mach; His Work, Life, and Influence'', University of California Press, 1972, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5ZY9qjB34PMC&amp;pg=PA206 p. 206].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wilhelm Ostwald]] expressed a similar scepticism about atoms, but changed his mind in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Jo Nye, ''Molecular Reality: A perspective on the Scientific Work of Jean Perrin'', Macdonald, 1972, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, [[peptic ulcer]]s were  believed to be caused by stress and dietary factors. The physicians [[Robin Warren]] and [[Barry Marshall]] showed in 1982 that the bacterium ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'' was responsible, but the medical community was slow to make appropriate changes in ulcer treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.cdc.gov/ulcer/history.htm |title=History of Ulcer Diagnosis and Treatment |publisher = CDC |accessdate=August 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Suppressed dissent==
Scientific debate is a healthy and necessary part of science, but scientific debate may collide with power dynamics within the academic world.&lt;ref name="Delborne"&gt;Delborne, J.A. (2016) [http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/607/bok%253A978-981-287-098-8.pdf?originUrl=http%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Fbook%2F10.1007%2F978-981-287-098-8&amp;token2=exp=1472342037~acl=%2Fstatic%2Fpdf%2F607%2Fbok%25253A978-981-287-098-8.pdf%3ForiginUrl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Flink.springer.com%252Fbook%252F10.1007%252F978-981-287-098-8*~hmac=8928e332db73d21684a40f689be1b3d21e90e139d3d1922a7960f8a29bc7f985#page=941 "Suppression and Dissent in Science"]. In: Tracey Ann Bretag (Ed) ''Handbook of Academic Integrity'', '''64''': 943–956. Springer. {{ISBN|9789812870971}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Suppression of legitimate scientific debate can be considered as a breach of academic integrity.&lt;ref name="Delborne"/&gt; Examples of suppression include journal editors rejecting a paper for political reasons prior to peer-review, refusing access to data for research which might draw negative conclusions about the safety of some commercial product, and putting pressure on a university to fire a dissenting researcher.&lt;ref name="Delborne"/&gt;

==False scientific dissent==
{{main article|Manufactured controversy}}
In modern times proponents of [[Denialism|science denialism]], [[pseudoscience]], and [[conspiracy theories]] often try to disguise their viewpoints as "scientific dissent" to take an advantage of the benefit of doubt. Such cases are typically recognized by lack of crucial elements of [[scientific approach]]: insufficient evidence base, lack of rigor and control, etc.&lt;ref name=assci&gt;[http://www.asianscientist.com/2014/04/features/keeping-modern-myths-conspiracy-theories-bay-2014/ "Keeping Modern Myths And Conspiracy Theories At Bay"], April 7, 2014, ''Asian Scientist Magazine''&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Lack of discussion of claims coming from [[fringe science]] may be presented as suppression by [[mainstream science]]. This was described as "manufacturing dissent" and discussed in the context of [[neo-creationism]].&lt;ref&gt;Matthew J. Brauer, Daniel R. Brumbaugh, "Biology Remystified: The Scientific Claims of the New Creationists," in: ''Intelligent Design Creationism and Its Critics: Philosophical, Theological, and Scientific Perspectives'', MIT Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0262661241}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=re4SXiklicAC&amp;pg=PA322 pp. 322, 323]&lt;/ref&gt;

David Harker in the introduction to his book ''Creating Scientific Controversies'', summarizes the history how tobacco industry worked towards manufacturing a controversy regarding the [[health effects of tobacco]].&lt;ref&gt;David Harker, ''Creating Scientific Controversies: Uncertainty and Bias in Science and Society'', {{ISBN|1107069610}}, Cambridge University Press, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In what is sometimes known as the "[[Association fallacy#Galileo Gambit|Galileo gambit]]," pseudoscientists will sometimes compare themselves to Galileo, arguing that opposition from established scientists is actually a point in favour of their ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel T. Willingham, ''When Can You Trust the Experts?: How to Tell Good Science from Bad in Education'', Wiley, 2012, {{ISBN|1118233271}}, Chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael D. Gordin, ''The Pseudoscience Wars: Immanuel Velikovsky and the Birth of the Modern Fringe'', University of Chicago Press, 2012, {{ISBN|0226304434}}, Chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean Paul Van Bendegem]] writes that "No doubt the most famous example of mistaken analogy is the abuse of Galileo Galilei's case resulting in his conviction by the Holy Inquisition. The basic strategy consists of equating Galileo with the poor astrologer or parapsychologist and equating the Inquisition with the scientific establishment."&lt;ref&gt;Jean Paul Van Bendegem, "Argumentation and Pseudoscience The Case for an Ethics of Argumentation," In Massimo Pigliucci &amp; Maarten Boudry (eds.), ''Philosophy of Pseudoscience: Reconsidering the Demarcation Problem'', University of Chicago Press, 2013, {{ISBN|022605182X}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Pc4OAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA298 p. 298].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect on modern public policies==
{{Main article|Politicization of science}}
Views which disagree with [[scientific consensus]] may have an adverse effect on the perception of science by general public and affect decision making in various policies. When prominently promoted without due proportion, dissenting views can create an impression of uncertainty to laypeople.&lt;ref name=immki/&gt;&lt;ref name=assci/&gt; Common examples of such situation include  [[global warming controversy]] and issues of [[public health]] and [[genetically modified organism]]s.  Therefore, scientists treat scientific dissent as problematic when it may have a significant impact on public and policy-making, and try to mitigate it.&lt;ref name=immki/&gt;&lt;ref name=maju&gt;Aklin, M. and Urpelainen, J. (2014) [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901113002141 "Perceptions of scientific dissent undermine public support for environmental policy"]. ''Environmental Science &amp; Policy'', '''38''': 173–177. {{doi|10.1016/j.envsci.2013.10.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inmaculada de Melo-Martín and Kristen Intemann criticize three major strategies in battling allegedly dangerous scientific dissent: masking the dissent, silencing the dissent, and discrediting the dissenters.&lt;ref name=immki/&gt; Melo-Martin and Intermann argue that these strategies come from a misdiagnosis: the real problem is not dissent,  but public scientific illiteracy. Rather than focusing on dissent, scientists must concentrate on educating the general public, so that people could make educated opinions and recognize false claims and invalid arguments. They further argue that silencing dissent rather than promoting literacy incurs the risk of undermining the public trust in science.&lt;ref name=immki/&gt;

[[Sheila Jasanoff]], in the context of [[climate change]], mentions a common argument that public opinion is poorly informed because [[petroleum industry]] manufactures uncertainties and the media exaggerate the dissent, but argues that it is insufficient for the understanding of the problem. She writes that studies of scientific controversies show that credibility of science depend not only on strong scientific consensus, but also on the persuasive power of those who speak for science, especially in the situations of controversy.&lt;ref&gt;Sheila Jasanoff, "Cosmopolitan Knowledge: [[Climate Science]] and Global Civic [[Epistemology]]", in: ''The Oxford Handbook of Climate Change and Society'', 2011, {{ISBN|0199566607}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Scientific law versus Scientific theories.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Scientific theories explain why something happens, whereas Scientific Laws record what happens.]]
The '''laws of science''', also called '''[[scientific law]]s''' or '''scientific principles''', are statements that describe or [[prediction|predict]] a range of [[natural phenomena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|law of nature}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each scientific law is a statement based on [[reproducibility|repeated]] [[experiment]]al [[observation]]s that describes some aspect of the [[Universe]]. The term ''law'' has diverse usage in many cases (approximate, accurate, broad, or narrow [[scientific theory|theories]]) across all fields of [[natural science]] ([[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[geology]], [[astronomy]], etc.). Scientific laws summarize and explain a large collection of facts determined by [[experiment]], and are tested based on their ability to predict the results of future experiments. They are developed either from facts or through [[mathematics]], and are strongly supported by [[Empirical evidence|empirical]] [[evidence]]. It is generally understood that they reflect causal relationships fundamental to reality, and are discovered rather than invented.&lt;ref name="McComas2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=William F. McComas|title=The Language of Science Education: An Expanded Glossary of Key Terms and Concepts in Science Teaching and Learning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aXzGBAAAQBAJ|date=30 December 2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-94-6209-497-0|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laws reflect scientific knowledge that experiments have repeatedly verified (and never [[Falsifiability|falsified]]). Their accuracy does not change when new theories are worked out, but rather the scope of application, since the equation (if any) representing the law does not change. As with other scientific knowledge, they do not have absolute certainty (as mathematical [[theorems]] or [[Identity (mathematics)|identities]] do), and it is always possible for a law to be overturned by future observations. A law can usually be formulated as one or several statements or [[equation]]s, so that it can be used to predict the outcome of an experiment, given the circumstances of the processes taking place.

Laws differ from [[hypotheses]] and [[postulates]], which are proposed during the [[Scientific method|scientific process]] before and during validation by experiment and observation. [[Hypotheses]] and [[postulates]] are not laws since they have not been verified to the same degree and may not be sufficiently general, although they may lead to the formulation of laws. A law is a more solidified and formal statement, distilled from repeated experiment. Laws are narrower in scope than [[Scientific theory|scientific theories]], which may contain one or several laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncse.com/evolution/education/definitions-fact-theory-law-scientific-work Definitions from the NCSE]&lt;/ref&gt; Science distinguishes a law or theory from facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://dels.nas.edu/resources/static-assets/materials-based-on-reports/reports-in-brief/role_of_theory_final.pdf | title=The Role of Theory in Advancing 21st Century Biology: Catalyzing Transformative Research |publisher = The National Academy of Sciences |year =2007 |journal=Report in Brief |}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calling a law a [[scientific fact|fact]] is [[ambiguous]], an [[overstatement]], or an [[equivocation]].&lt;ref name=gouldfact&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_fact-and-theory.html | first = Stephen Jay | last = Gould | authorlink = Stephen Jay Gould | title  = Evolution as Fact and Theory | journal = Discover | volume = 2 | issue = 5 | date = 1981-05-01 | pages = 34–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the nature of a scientific law is a question in [[philosophy]] and although scientific laws describe nature mathematically, scientific laws are practical conclusions reached by the [[scientific method]]; they are intended to be neither laden with [[ontology|ontological]] commitments nor statements of logical [[wikt:absolute#Noun|absolutes]].

According to the [[unity of science]] thesis, ''all'' scientific laws follow fundamentally from physics. Laws which occur in other sciences ultimately follow from [[physical law]]s. Often, from mathematically fundamental viewpoints, [[universal constant]]s emerge from a scientific law.

==Overview==
A scientific law always applies under the same conditions, and implies that there is a causal relationship involving its elements. [[Scientific fact|Factual]] and well-confirmed statements like "Mercury is liquid at standard temperature and pressure" are considered too specific to qualify as scientific laws. A central problem in the [[philosophy of science]], going back to [[David Hume]], is that of distinguishing causal relationships (such as those implied by laws) from principles that arise due to [[constant conjunction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Laws differ from [[scientific theory|scientific theories]] in that they do not posit a mechanism or explanation of phenomena: they are merely distillations of the results of repeated observation. As such, a law is limited in applicability to circumstances resembling those already observed, and may be found false when extrapolated. [[Ohm's law]] only applies to linear networks, [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] only applies in weak gravitational fields, the early laws of [[aerodynamics]] such as [[Bernoulli's principle]] do not apply in case of [[compressible flow]] such as occurs in [[transonic]] and [[supersonic]] flight, [[Hooke's law]] only applies to [[strain (physics)|strain]] below the [[elastic limit]], etc. These laws remain useful, but only under the conditions where they apply.

Many laws take [[mathematics|mathematical]] forms, and thus can be stated as an equation; for example, the [[law of conservation of energy]] can be written as &lt;math&gt;\Delta E = 0&lt;/math&gt;, where E is the total amount of energy in the universe. Similarly, the [[first law of thermodynamics]] can be written as &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}U=\delta Q-\delta W\,&lt;/math&gt;.

The term "scientific law" is traditionally associated with the [[natural sciences]], though the [[social sciences]] also contain laws.&lt;ref name=Ehrenberg&gt;[[Andrew S. C. Ehrenberg]] (1993), "[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v365/n6445/pdf/365385a0.pdf Even the Social Sciences Have Laws]", [[Nature (journal)|Nature]], 365:6445 (30), page 385.{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a scientific law in social sciences is [[Zipf's law]].

Like theories and hypotheses, laws make predictions (specifically, they predict that new observations will conform to the law), and can be [[Falsifiability|falsified]] if they are found in contradiction with new data.

== Conservation laws ==

===Conservation and symmetry===
{{main article|Symmetry (physics)}}

Most significant laws in science are [[conservation laws]]. These fundamental laws follow from homogeneity of space, time and [[phase (waves)|phase]], in other words ''symmetry''.

*'''[[Noether's theorem]]:''' Any quantity which has a continuous differentiable symmetry in the action has an associated conservation law.
* [[Conservation of mass]] was the first law of this type to be understood, since most macroscopic physical processes involving masses, for example collisions of massive particles or fluid flow, provide the apparent belief that mass is conserved. Mass conservation was observed to be true for all chemical reactions. In general this is only approximative, because with the advent of relativity and experiments in nuclear and particle physics: mass can be transformed into energy and vice versa, so mass is not always conserved, but part of the more general conservation of mass-energy.
*'''[[Conservation of energy]]''', '''[[Conservation of momentum|momentum]]''' and '''[[Conservation of angular momentum|angular momentum]]''' for isolated systems can be found to be [[Time translation symmetry|symmetries in time]], translation, and rotation.
*'''[[Conservation of charge]]''' was also realized since charge has never been observed to be created or destroyed, and only found to move from place to place.

===Continuity and transfer===

Conservation laws can be expressed using the general [[continuity equation]] (for a conserved quantity) can be written in differential form as:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}=-\nabla \cdot \mathbf{J} &lt;/math&gt;

where ρ is some quantity per unit volume, '''J''' is the [[flux]] of that quantity (change in quantity per unit time per unit area). Intuitively, the [[divergence]] (denoted ∇•) of a [[vector field]] is a measure of flux diverging radially outwards from a point, so the negative is the amount piling up at a point, hence the rate of change of density in a region of space must be the amount of flux leaving or collecting in some region (see main article for details). In the table below, the fluxes, flows for various physical quantities in transport, and their associated continuity equations, are collected for comparison.

==Laws of classical mechanics==

===Principle of least action===

{{Main|Principle of least action}}

All of classical mechanics, including [[Newton's laws]], [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrange's equations]], [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamilton's equations]], etc., can be derived from this very simple principle:

:&lt;math&gt; \delta \mathcal{S} = \delta\int_{t_1}^{t_2} L(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{\dot{q}}, t) dt = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{S} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[action (physics)|action]]; the integral of the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]]

:&lt;math&gt; L(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{\dot{q}}, t) = T(\mathbf{\dot{q}}, t)-V(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{\dot{q}}, t)&lt;/math&gt;

of the physical system between two times ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The kinetic energy of the system is ''T'' (a function of the rate of change of the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration]] of the system), and [[potential energy]] is ''V'' (a function of the configuration and its rate of change). The configuration of a system which has ''N'' [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]] is defined by [[generalized coordinates]] '''q''' = (''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... ''q&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;'').

There are [[Canonical coordinates|generalized momenta]] conjugate to these coordinates, '''p''' = (''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''p&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;''), where:

:&lt;math&gt;p_i = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i}&lt;/math&gt;

The action and Lagrangian both contain the dynamics of the system for all times. The term "path" simply refers to a curve traced out by the system in terms of the [[generalized coordinates]] in the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]], i.e. the curve '''q'''(''t''), parameterized by time (see also [[parametric equation]] for this concept).

The action is a ''[[functional (mathematics)|functional]]'' rather than a ''[[function (mathematics)|function]]'', since it depends on the Lagrangian, and the Lagrangian depends on the path '''q'''(''t''), so the action depends on the ''entire'' "shape" of the path for all times (in the time interval from ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Between two instants of time, there are infinitely many paths, but one for which the action is stationary (to the first order) is the true path. The stationary value for the ''entire continuum'' of Lagrangian values corresponding to some path, ''not just one value'' of the Lagrangian, is required (in other words it is ''not'' as simple as "differentiating a function and setting it to zero, then solving the equations to find the points of [[maxima and minima]] etc", rather this idea is applied to the entire "shape" of the function, see [[calculus of variations]] for more details on this procedure).&lt;ref&gt;Feynman Lectures on Physics: Volume 2, R.P. Feynman, R.B. Leighton, M. Sands, Addison-Wesley, 1964, {{isbn|0-201-02117-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notice ''L'' is ''not'' the total energy ''E'' of the system due to the difference, rather than the sum:

:&lt;math&gt;E=T+V&lt;/math&gt;

Kibble, European Physics Series, McGraw-Hill (UK), 1973, {{isbn|0-07-084018-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; general approaches to classical mechanics are summarized below in the order of establishment. They are equivalent formulations, Newton's is very commonly used due to simplicity, but Hamilton's and Lagrange's equations are more general, and their range can extend into other branches of physics with suitable modifications.

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t} \left ( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i } \right ) = \frac{\partial L}{\partial q_i} &lt;/math&gt;

Using the definition of generalized momentum, there is the symmetry:

|colspan="2" scope="col" width="600px" | '''Newton's laws'''

'''[[Newton's laws of motion]]'''

They are low-limit solutions to [[theory of relativity|relativity]]. Alternative formulations of Newtonian mechanics are [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] and [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] mechanics.

The laws can be summarized by two equations (since the 1st is a special case of the 2nd, zero resultant acceleration):

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{p}}{\mathrm{d}t}, \quad \mathbf{F}_{ij}=-\mathbf{F}_{ji} &lt;/math&gt;

where '''p''' = momentum of body, '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; = force ''on'' body ''i'' ''by'' body ''j'', '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''ji''&lt;/sub&gt; = force ''on'' body ''j'' ''by'' body ''i''.

For a [[dynamical system]] the two equations (effectively) combine into one:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{p}_\mathrm{i}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \mathbf{F}_{E} + \sum_{\mathrm{i} \neq \mathrm{j}} \mathbf{F}_\mathrm{ij} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

in which '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; = resultant external force (due to any agent not part of system). Body ''i'' does not exert a force on itself.

From the above, any equation of motion in classical mechanics can be derived.

==Laws of gravitation and relativity==

===Modern laws===

;[[Special relativity]]

Postulates of special relativity are not "laws" in themselves, but assumptions of their nature in terms of ''relative motion''.

Often two are stated as "the laws of physics are the same in all [[inertial frames]]" and "the [[speed of light]] is constant". However the second is redundant, since the speed of light is predicted by [[Maxwell's equations]]. Essentially there is only one.

The said posulate leads to the [[Lorentz transformations]] – the transformation law between two [[frame of reference]]s moving relative to each other. For any [[4-vector]]

:&lt;math&gt;A' =\Lambda A &lt;/math&gt;

this replaces the [[Galilean transformation]] law from classical mechanics. The Lorentz transformations reduce to the Galilean transformations for low velocities much less than the speed of light ''c''.

The magnitudes of 4-vectors are invariants - ''not'' "conserved", but the same for all inertial frames (i.e. every observer in an inertial frame will agree on the same value), in particular if ''A'' is the [[four-momentum]], the magnitude can derive the famous invariant equation for mass-energy and momentum conservation (see [[invariant mass]]):

:&lt;math&gt; E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2 &lt;/math&gt;

in which the (more famous) [[mass-energy equivalence]] ''E'' = ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is a special case.

;[[General relativity]]

General relativity is governed by the [[Einstein field equation]]s, which describe the curvature of space-time due to mass-energy equivalent to the gravitational field. Solving the equation for the geometry of space warped due to the mass distribution gives the [[metric tensor]]. Using the geodesic equation, the motion of masses falling along the geodesics can be calculated.

;[[Gravitomagnetism]]

In a relatively flat spacetime due to weak gravitational fields, gravitational analogues of Maxwell's equations can be found; the '''GEM equations''', to describe an analogous ''[[Gravitomagnetism|gravitomagnetic field]]''. They are well established by the theory, and experimental tests form ongoing research.&lt;ref name="Gravitation and Inertia"&gt;Gravitation and Inertia, I. Ciufolini and J.A.

These equations can be modified to include [[magnetic monopole]]s, and are consistent with our observations of monopoles either existing or not existing; if they do not exist, the generalized equations reduce to the ones above, if they do, the equations become fully symmetric in electric and magnetic charges and currents. Indeed, there is a duality transformation where electric and magnetic charges can be "rotated into one another", and still satisfy Maxwell's equations.

;Pre-Maxwell laws

These laws were found before the formulation of Maxwell's equations. They are not fundamental, since they can be derived from Maxwell's Equations. Coulomb's Law can be found from Gauss' Law (electrostatic form) and the Biot–Savart Law can be deduced from Ampere's Law (magnetostatic form). Lenz' Law and Faraday's Law can be incorporated into the Maxwell-Faraday equation. Nonetheless they are still very effective for simple calculations.

Classically, [[optics]] is based on a [[variational principle]]: light travels from one point in space to another in the shortest time.

*[[Fermat's principle]]

In [[geometric optics]] laws are based on approximations in Euclidean geometry (such as the [[paraxial approximation]]).

*[[Law of reflection]]

In [[physical optics]], laws are based on physical properties of materials.

*[[Brewster's law|Brewster's angle]]

In actuality, optical properties of matter are significantly more complex and require quantum mechanics.

== Laws of quantum mechanics==

Quantum mechanics has its roots in [[postulates of quantum mechanics|postulates]]. This leads to results which are not usually called "laws", but hold the same status, in that all of quantum mechanics follows from them.

One postulate that a particle (or a system of many particles) is described by a [[wavefunction]], and this satisfies a quantum wave equation: namely the [[Schrödinger equation]] (which can be written as a non-relativistic wave equation, or a [[relativistic wave equation]]). Solving this wave equation predicts the time-evolution of the system's behaviour, analogous to solving Newton's laws in classical mechanics.

Other postulates change the idea of physical observables; using [[operators (physics)|quantum operators]]; some measurements can't be made at the same instant of time ([[Uncertainty principle]]s), particles are fundamentally indistinguishable. Another postulate; the [[wavefunction collapse]] postulate, counters the usual idea of a measurement in science.

== Laws of chemistry ==
{{Main|Chemical law}}

'''Chemical laws''' are those [[natural law|laws of nature]] relevant to [[chemistry]]. Historically, observations led to many empirical laws, though now it is known that chemistry has its foundations in [[quantum mechanics]].

;[[Quantitative analysis (chemistry)|Quantitative analysis]]

The most fundamental concept in chemistry is the [[law of conservation of mass]], which states that there is no detectable change in the quantity of matter during an ordinary [[chemical reaction]]. Modern physics shows that it is actually [[energy]] that is conserved, and that [[Mass–energy equivalence|energy and mass are related]]; a concept which becomes important in [[nuclear chemistry]]. [[Conservation of energy]] leads to the important concepts of [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]], [[thermodynamics]], and [[chemical kinetics|kinetics]].

Additional laws of chemistry elaborate on the law of conservation of mass.  [[Joseph Proust]]'s [[law of definite composition]] says that pure chemicals are composed of elements in a definite formulation; we now know that the structural arrangement of these elements is also important.

[[John Dalton|Dalton]]'s [[law of multiple proportions]] says that these chemicals will present themselves in proportions that are small whole numbers (i.e. 1:2 for [[Oxygen]]:[[Hydrogen]] ratio in water); although in many systems (notably [[Biomolecule|biomacromolecules]] and [[minerals]]) the ratios tend to require large numbers, and are frequently represented as a fraction.

More modern laws of chemistry define the relationship between energy and its transformations.

;[[Reaction kinetics]] and [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibria]]

* In equilibrium, molecules exist in mixture defined by the transformations possible on the timescale of the equilibrium, and are in a ratio defined by the intrinsic energy of the molecules—the lower the intrinsic energy, the more abundant the molecule. [[Le Chatelier's principle]] states that the system opposes changes in conditions from equilibrium states, i.e. there is an opposition to change the state of an equilibrium reaction.
* Transforming one structure to another requires the input of energy to cross an energy barrier; this can come from the intrinsic energy of the molecules themselves, or from an external source which will generally accelerate transformations.  The higher the energy barrier, the slower the transformation occurs.
* There is a hypothetical intermediate, or ''transition structure'', that corresponds to the structure at the top of the energy barrier.  The [[Hammond's postulate|Hammond–Leffler postulate]] states that this structure looks most similar to the product or starting material which has intrinsic energy closest to that of the energy barrier.  Stabilizing this hypothetical intermediate through chemical interaction is one way to achieve [[catalysis]].
* All chemical processes are reversible (law of [[microscopic reversibility]]) although some processes have such an energy bias, they are essentially irreversible.
* The reaction rate has the mathematical parameter known as the [[rate constant]]. The [[Arrhenius equation]] gives the temperature and [[activation energy]] dependence of the rate constant, an empirical law.

;[[Thermochemistry]]

*[[Dulong–Petit law]]
*[[Gibbs–Helmholtz equation]]
*[[Hess's law]]

;Gas laws

*[[Raoult's law]]
*[[Henry's law]]

;Chemical transport

*[[Fick's laws of diffusion]]

The '''Skolkovo Innovation Center''' is a high technology business area that is being built at [[Mozhaysky District, Moscow|Mozhaysky District]] in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themoscowtimes.com/vedomosti/article/russian-silicon-valley-for-moscow-region/399710.html Russian 'Silicon Valley' for Moscow Region], ''[[The Moscow Times]]'', 15 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE62H33S20100318 Kremlin picks site for Russian "Silicon Valley"], [[Reuters]], 18 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ben Morris, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8638222.stm Russia creates its own Silicon Valley], [[BBC News]], 26 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Although historically Russia has been successful with development of science and technology, its lack of entrepreneur spirit led to government intervention of patents and nonproliferation of Russian tech companies beyond the scope of regional service. As corporations and individuals become "residents" of the city, with proposed projects and ideas receiving financial assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sk.ru/news/|title=News|publisher=|accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Skolkovo was first announced on 12 November 2009 by then Russian President [[Dmitry Medvedev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.i-gorod.com/en/ist/|title=News - Skolkovo Community|publisher=|accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complex is headed by [[Viktor Vekselberg]] and co-chaired by former [[Intel Corporation|Intel]] CEO [[Craig Barrett (chief executive)|Craig Barrett]].

== The scheme of work ==
[[File:RIAN archive 1006427 Presentation by Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology.jpg|thumb|[[Viktor Vekselberg]], head of the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology]]

In March 2010, Vekselberg announced the necessity of developing a special legal order in Skolkovo and emphasized the need to offer a tax holiday lasting 5–7 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vesti.ru/videos?vid=265909 Viktor Vekselberg: we create an environment where you will have gained a critical level of intelligence]. Vesti video&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, Russian Prime Minister [[Dmitry Medvedev]] charged the government with working out specific legal, administrative, tax and customs regulations on Skolkovo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.kremlin.ru/transcripts/7585 Verbatim record of the meeting of the Commission for Modernization and Technological Development of Russian Economy]. The Kremlin&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010, Dmitry Medvedev introduced two bills regulating working conditions in Skolkovo. The bills were adopted by the [[State Duma]] in September of that year&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/1511790 The September reading]. Kommersant.ru&lt;/ref&gt; and, on 28 September 2010, the President of the Russian Federation signed the bills into federal law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kremlin.ru/acts/9056 Dmitry Medvedev signed the law on innovation center "Skolkovo"] The Kremlin&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kremlin.ru/acts/9057 Changes to some legislative acts in connection with the adoption of the law on innovation center "Skolkovo"]. The Kremlin&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2010, Dmitry Medvedev introduced a bill easing migratory policies in regards to Skolkovo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/1488473 Professionals do not need accounting and control]. Kommersant.ru&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Visa policies for foreign nationals ===

On 20 August 2010, a new government decree regulating visas for participants of the Skolkovo project was published. According to this decree, specialized and highly skilled foreign nationals who arrive in Russia with the purpose of securing employment at Skolkovo will be granted a visa for a term of up to 30 days. In the event of successful job placement they can then obtain a work visa for a term of 3 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/1492089|title=Специалистам "Сколково" определили визовый режим|first1=Дарья|last1=Николаева|first2=Дарья|last2=Николаева|date=23 August 2010|publisher=|accessdate=6 November 2016|via=Kommersant}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transportation ===

A new highway was opened connecting Skolkovo to the MKAD in June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lenta.ru/news/2010/06/12/roadtoskolkovo/|title=Шувалов и Громов открыли дорогу в Сколково|publisher=|accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Railway transport will be available via [[Belorussky Rail Terminal]] and [[Kiyevsky Rail Terminal]]. A link to [[Vnukovo International Airport]] is also planned.

=== Financing ===

The innovation center will be financed primarily from the [[Federal budget of Russia|Russian federal budget]]. The center's 2010 budget was 3.9 Billion RUB. An additional 22 Billion RUB is planned for 2012 and 17.3 Billion RUB in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kommersant.ru/News/1482479|title=Государство вложит в центр «Сколково» 54 млрд рублей|date=8 May 2010|publisher=|accessdate=6 November 2016|via=Kommersant}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rg.ru/2010/08/04/skolkovo-dok.html|title=Правила предоставления в 2010 году субсидии из федерального бюджета на мероприятия, связанные с созданием инновационного центра "Сколково"|publisher=|accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Clusters ==
[[File:Moscow international medical cluster1.jpg|thumb|[[The Moscow International Medical Cluster|Moscow International Medical Cluster]]]]

Skolkovo includes five "clusters" specializing in different areas. These include IT, Energy, Nuclear Technologies, Biomedicine and Space Technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sk.ru/Model.aspx|title=News - Skolkovo Community|publisher=|accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Information technologies ===

The IT cluster is tasked with creating an effective model for successful commercialization of IT technologies in Russia. Over 450 companies have signed up for the IT cluster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sk.ru/Model/AboutFund/Clusters/IT.aspx|title=News - Skolkovo Community|publisher=|accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;IT ecosystem includes over 50 fast growing cyber-security startup companies with more than 700 employees in total

=== Energy-efficient technologies ===

The Energy Efficient Technologies cluster aims to introduce breakthrough technologies focused on the reduction of energy consumption by industrial, housing and municipal infrastructure facilities. Today over 80 companies are on board for the energy efficiency cluster.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sk.ru/Model/AboutFund/Clusters/Energy-Effectiveness.aspx Energy Efficient Technologies Cluster]. Official Skolkova Website&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nuclear technologies ===

The Nuclear Technologies cluster aims to encourage the competitiveness of nuclear power markets and develop breakthrough technologies and products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sk.ru/Model/AboutFund/Clusters/Nuclear-Technology.aspx Nuclear Technologies Cluster] Official Skolkovo website&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biomedical technologies ===

The strategic goal of this cluster is to create an ecosystem for biomedical innovation. In order to achieve this goal, the best practices of leading biotechnology and biomedical research centers were studied. More than 215 companies have signed on for the Biomedical Technologies cluster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.sk.ru/foundation/biomed/p/results.aspx|title=Results - Skolkovo Community|publisher=|accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Space technologies and telecommunications ===

The Space Technology and Telecommunications cluster is intended to strengthen Russia's position in the respective industries. The scope of activity is wide: from [[space tourism]] to satellite navigation systems. Russian companies aim to increase their market share in this global market, the total volume of which is estimated at $300 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sk.ru/Model/AboutFund/Clusters/Space.aspx|title=News - Skolkovo Community|publisher=|accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cooperation between clusters ===

There are examples of cooperation between the clusters. For example, in 2012 clusters of Information Technologies and Biomedical Technologies organized joint contest on Mobile Diagnostic Device "Skolkovo M.D."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.sk.ru/foundation/itc/md/|title=Сколково M.D. - Skolkovo Community|publisher=|accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[FRUCT]] was named the contest winner.

== Innovation City ==

The main elements of The City are the University and a Technopark. The City will also feature a Congress Center, office buildings, laboratories, fitness centers and stores. The City will measure roughly 400 hectares and have a permanent population of 21,000. Employees, including commuters from Moscow and surrounding regions, will comprise about 31,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sk.ru/Model/Gorod.aspx?sc_Lang=en The City]. Sk.ru/Model - a Vault of animated video tours of the city.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainable development===
At least 50% of the energy consumed by the city will come from renewable sources. The well-developed water system uses significantly less water by Russian standards without compromising comfort or hygiene. The transport system prioritizes walking and cycling. The use of vehicles with internal combustion engines is prohibited in the city. Energy passive and active buildings that do not require energy from the outside and even produce more energy than they consume will be built at Skolkovo. Household and municipal waste will be disposed of in the most environmentally friendly way possible – leveraging the use of [[plasma gasification|plasma incinerator technology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sk.ru/Model/Gorod.aspx? Sustainable Development] Sk.ru.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electronics Technology Center (ETC)==

In July 2012, [[IBM]] and five leading Russian innovation companies: the [[Skolkovo Foundation]], [[Rusnano]], [[Rostelecom]], [[Russian Venture Company]] and [[ITFY]], all signed a collaboration agreement to foster a culture of applied research and commercialization and attract key talent and investment from around the world in the area of microelectronics.

The agreement will give the Electronics Technology Center access to IBM’s intellectual property for chip design. IBM will also provide cloud computing technologies to form the basis of a new virtual design environment to be used to develop new microelectronic devices such as sensors to be used in smarter infrastructure projects, industry and consumer electronics.

The cloud will help unite Russia’s dispersed microelectronics development teams and provide access to advanced technologies and best practice and foster global collaboration. Russian chip designers and fabless design houses will be able to access new semiconductor technologies, including automation tools, design kits, libraries and intellectual property. The center will also provide access to a wide variety of semiconductor production processes offered by many different foundries.

The agreement was signed by [[Victor Vekselberg]], President of the Skolkovo Foundation; [[Anatoly Chubais]], CEO and Chairman of the Executive Board of Rosnano; [[Alexander Provotorov]], President and Chairman of the Management Board of Rostelecom; [[Igor Agamirzian]], CEO of Russian Venture Company; [[Evgeny Babayan]], Chairman of the Board, ITFY; [[Leonid Svatkov]], CEO ITFY; [[Bruno Di Leo]], Senior Vice President IBM; and Kirill Korniliev, Country General Manager, IBM Russia &amp; CIS.

The ETC will initially focus on [[microelectronics]] design; however in the future it may be extended to other fields where cloud computing can support collaborative development projects.&lt;ref&gt;rushpr [http://rushprnews.com/2012/07/13/cloud-computing-technologies-to-form-basis-of-new-virtual-design-fab Cloud computing technologies to form basis of new virtual design fab]. 13 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Open University Skolkovo (OpUS) ==

Skolkovo's Open University (OpUS) isn't an educational institution in the typical sense of the word, because graduating students don't receive a diploma. Instead, OpUS is a source of prospective Masters and PhD candidates, for the Skolkovo University of Science and Technology ([[SkTech]]), and interns for Skolkovo partner companies. The educational plan of OpUS includes lecture series, master classes and courses by leading scientists, thinkers and practitioners. Students acquire knowledge in the priority research and development areas of Skolkovo ([[information technology]], [[biomedicine]], [[energetics]], [[space]] and [[nuclear technology]]). In addition, they have an opportunity to gain knowledge in academic and innovative competencies (foresight, forecasting, thinking, projecting), entrepreneur competence, experience in teamwork on projecting and solving inter-disciplinary problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sk.ru/news/|title=News|publisher=|accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OpUS was opened on 21 April 2011 in Moscow. Selection for Winter 2011-2012 students was carried out in [[Saint Petersburg]] and [[Tomsk]]. There are currently more than 250 students enrolled in OpUS.

According to [[Robin Williams (academic)|Robin A. Williams]] and David Edge (1996), "Central to '''social shaping of technology''' ('''SST''') is the concept that there are choices (though not necessarily conscious choices) inherent in both the design of individual artifacts and systems, and in the direction or trajectory of innovation programs."

If technology does not emerge from the unfolding of a predetermined logic or a single determinant, then innovation is a 'garden of forking paths'. Different routes are available, potentially leading to different technological outcomes. Significantly, these choices could have differing implications for society and for particular social groups.

SST is one of the models of the technology: society relationship which emerged in the 1980s with MacKenzie and Wajcman's influential 1985 collection, alongside Pinch and Bijker's  [[social construction of technology]] framework and Callon and Latour's [[actor-network theory]]. These have a common feature of criticism of the [[linear model of innovation]] and  [[technological determinism]].  It differs from these notably in the attention it pays to the influence of the social and technological context of development which shapes innovation choices. SST is concerned to explore the material consequences of different technical choices, but criticizes technological determinism, which argues that technology follows its own developmental path, outside of human influences, and in turn, influences society. In this way, social shaping theorists conceive the relationship between technology and society as one of '[[Mutual Shaping|mutual shaping]]'.

Some versions of this theory state that technology affects society by affordances, constraints, preconditions, and unintended consequences (Baym, 2015). Affordance is the idea that technology makes specific tasks easier in our lives, while constraints make tasks harder to complete. The preconditions of technology are the skills and resources  that are vital to using the technology to its fullest potential. Finally, the unintended consequences of technology are unanticipated effects and impact of technology. The cell phone is an example of social shaping of technology (Zulto 2009). The cell phone has evolved over the years to make our lives easier by providing people with handheld computers that can answer calls, answer emails, search for information, and complete numerous other tasks (Zulto, 2009). Yet it has constraints for those that are not technologically savvy, hindering many people in society who do not understand how to utilize these devices. There are preconditions, such as monthly bills and access to electricity. There are also many unintended consequences such as the unintended distraction they cause for many people.

Not only does technology affect society, but according to SST, society affects technology by way of economics, politics, and culture (Baym, 2015). For instance, cell phones have spread in poor countries due to cell phones being more affordable than a computer and internet service (economics), government regulations which have made it fairly easy for cell phone providers to build networks (politics), and the small size of cell phones which fit easily into many cultures’ need for mobile communication (culture).

'''''Synopses of the British Fauna''''' is a series of identification guides, published by [[Linnean Society of London|The Linnean Society]] and [[The Estuarine and Coastal Sciences Association]]. Each volume in the series provides and in-depth analysis of a group of animals and is designed to bridge the gap between the standard [[field guide]] and more specialised [[monograph]] or [[treatise]]. The series is now published by [[Field Studies Council|The Field Studies Council]] on behalf of The Linnean Society and The Estuarine and Coastal Sciences Association. 

The series is designed for use in the field and is kept as user friendly as possible with [[technical terminology]] kept to a minimum and a glossary of terms provided, although the complexity of the subject matter makes the books more suitable for the more experienced practitioner.

== History of the series ==

On 11 March 1943, at a meeting of [[Linnean Society of London|The Linnean Society]] in Burlington House, TH Savoy presented his "Synopsis of the Opiliones" (Harvestmen). It was so well received that a decision was made there and then to publish it as the first of a series of "ecological fauna lists".

Re-launched by Dr Doris Kermack in the mid-1960s, the New Series of ''Synopses of the British Fauna'' went from strength to strength. From number 13, the series had been jointly sponsored by [[The Estuarine and Coastal Sciences Association]] and Dr RSK Barnes became co-editor.

From 1993, the series has been published by [[Field Studies Council|The Field Studies Council]] and benefits from association with the extensive testing undertaken as part of the [[AIDGAP]] project.

== Volumes ==

The series contains the following volumes, many of which are out of print. Many of the volumes have been updated and reprinted under slightly different names to reflect either [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] changes or advances in the understanding of a group.

'''''The Sun, the Genome, and the Internet''''' is a non-fiction scientific book by renowned physicist [[Freeman J. Dyson]], Professor Emeritus of [[Physics]] at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]], [[Princeton University]] in the U.S.A. This short book was originally published in [[1999 in literature|1999]] by the Oxford University Press.

==Synopsis==
Professor Dyson suggests that three rapidly advancing technologies, [[Solar Energy]], [[Genetic Engineering]] and World-Wide Communication together have the potential to create a more equal distribution of the world's wealth. Amongst other things he proposes that solar power in the [[Third World]] could connect even the most remote areas to all of the information on the internet, potentially ending the cultural isolation of the poorest countries. Likewise, breakthroughs in genetics could lead to more efficient crops, thereby engendering the renewed vitality of traditional village life, currently devalued by the global market.

==Reviews==
*'A most engaging and important book, as accessible as it is profound.' - [[Oliver Sacks]]
*'A thought-provoking glimpse into the 21st century...Only Dyson could weave together this rich tapestry, blending ethics, ideology, science and technology into a coherent vision of the future.' - [[Michio Kaku]], author of ''Hyperspace and Visions: How Science Will Revolutionize the 21st Century''

'''''The Third Culture: Beyond the Scientific Revolution''''' is a 1995 book by [[John Brockman (literary agent)|John Brockman]] which discusses the work of several well-known scientists who are directly communicating their new, sometimes provocative, ideas to the general public. John Brockman has continued the themes of 'The Third Culture' in the website of the [[Edge Foundation, Inc.|Edge Foundation]], where leading scientists and thinkers contribute their thoughts in plain English.

The title of the book refers to [[Charles Percy Snow]]'s 1959 work ''[[The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution]]'', which described the conflict between the cultures of the [[humanities]] and [[science]].

== Contents ==
23 people were included in the 1995 book:
* physicist [[Paul Davies]]
* biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] 
* philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]]
* paleontologist [[Niles Eldredge]]
* chaos theorist [[J. Doyne Farmer]]
* theoretical physicist [[Murray Gell-Mann]]
* biologist [[Brian Goodwin]]
* geologist/biologist [[Stephen Jay Gould]]
* physicist [[Alan Guth]]
* inventor [[W. Daniel Hillis]]
* theoretical psychologist [[Nicholas Humphrey]]
* geneticist [[Steve Jones (biologist)|Steve Jones]]
* biologist [[Stuart Kauffman]]
* complex systems specialist [[Christopher Langton]]
* biologist [[Lynn Margulis]]
* mathematician and computer scientist [[Marvin Minsky]]
* mathematical physicist [[Roger Penrose]]
* cognitive scientist [[Steven Pinker]]
* theoretical astrophysicist [[Martin Rees]]
* cognitive scientist [[Roger Schank]]
* theoretical physicist [[Lee Smolin]]
* biologist [[Francisco Varela]]
* evolutionary biologist [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]]

The book influenced the reception of popular scientific literature in parts of the world beyond the United States. In Germany, the book inspired several newspapers to integrate scientific reports into their "[[Feuilleton]]" or "culture" sections (such as the ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]''). At the same time, the assertions of the book were discussed as a source of controversy, especially the implicit assertion that "third culture thinking" is mainly an American development. Critics acknowledge that, whereas in the Anglo-Saxon cultures there is a large tradition of scientists writing popular books, such tradition was absent for a long period in the German and French languages, with journalists often filling the gap. However, some decades ago there were also scientists, like the physicists [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]] and [[Schrödinger]] and the psychologist [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]], who fulfill the criteria Brockman named for "third culture." The German author [[Gabor Paal]] suggested that the idea of the "third culture" is a rather modern version of what [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] called [[Realphilosophie]] (''philosophy of the real'').

Also, already during the [[interwar period]], [[Otto Neurath]] and other members of the [[Vienna Circle]] strongly propagated the need for both the [[unity of science]] and the popularization of new scientific concepts. With the rise of the Nazis in Germany and Austria, many of the Vienna Circle's members left for the United States where they taught in several universities, causing their philosophical ideas to spread in the Anglo-Saxon world throughout the 1930s-1940s.

'''''Wolfstein, The Murderer; or, The Secrets of a Robber’s Cave''''' is an 1850 [[chapbook]] based on [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]’s 1811 Gothic horror novel ''[[St. Irvyne;  or, The Rosicrucian]]''.[[File:Wolfstein, the Murderer Title page.jpg|thumb|Title page.]]

==Background==

The 1811 novel ''St. Irvyne, or, The Rosicrucian'' was republished by [[John Joseph Stockdale]] in 1822 following Shelley’s death. Two chapbooks were also published based on the novel. No publication date appeared on the title page.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/gothicbibliograp00summ#page/n627/mode/2up Summers, Montague. ''A Gothic Bibliography.'' London: The Fortune Press, 1940, p. 561. No date of publication. Circa 1800. No author.]&lt;/ref&gt;
The first chapbook version was entitled ''[[Wolfstein (Percy Bysshe Shelley chapbook)|Wolfstein; or, The Mysterious Bandit]]'' and was published and printed by John Bailey at 116, Chancery Lane in London in 1822.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Wolfstein.html?id=JRoBHQAACAAJ ''Wolfstein; Or, The Mysterious Bandit.''

Chapbooks were meant for popular consumption, serving the same function as a paperback would. The chapbook sold for sixpence.

Another more condensed twelve-page chapbook was published in 1850 by Thomas Redriffe in London entitled ''Wolfstein, the Murderer; or, The Secrets of a Robber's Cave: A Terrific Romance. To which is Added, The Two Serpents, an Oriental Apologue.'' The Ossian epigraph appeared on the title page: "A tale of horror, of murder, and of deeds done in darkness." Printed for Thomas Redriffe, Piccadilly. The price was "Two Pence".  Printed by William Bethell, 10, Marshall-street, Liverpool. No date of publication appeared on the title page.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Wolfstein_the_Murderer_Or_The_Secrets_of.html?id=OZhmngEACAAJ ''Wolfstein, the Murderer; Or, The Secrets of a Robber's Cave: A Terrific Romance.

Bodleian Library. University of Oxford.]&lt;/ref&gt; The story was six pages long, pages three through eight. The second story was four pages long, pages nine through twelve.

The frontispiece consisted of a drawing of Wolfstein confronted by a skeleton struck by lightning. He stands over the corpse of Serena. The drawing is a more condensed version of the 1822 frontispiece. The caption reads: "Deeper grew the gloom of the cavern, and darkness seemed to press around him. Suddenly a flash of lightning burst through the cavern, followed by thunder that appeared to convulse the universal fabric of nature; and borne on the sulphurous blast, the Prince of Terrors stood before him."

==Plot Summary==
[[File:Wolfstein, the Murderer Frontispiece.jpg|left|thumb|Frontispiece.]]The chapbook follows the plot of the first section of the novel ''St. Irvyne'' on the bandits but omits the second part featuring Frederic Nempere in Geneva. The account is radically condensed.
The name of Cavigni, leader of the bandits, is changed to Stiletto. The name of Megalena is changed to Serena. The character of Ginotti, the Rosicrucian alchemist, does not appear.

The opening scene is of a raging thunderstorm. Wolfstein is a wanderer in the Swiss Alps who seeks cover from the storm. He is a distraught outcast who plans to commit suicide. A group of monks carrying a body for burial in a torch-light procession runs into him and saves his life.

Bandits then attack them. Wolfstein is accepted as a member of the bandits. He becomes used to a life of crime. But a rivalry develops between him and Stilleto over Serena. He decides to poison the chief by secretly placing a white powder in his wine. Stiletto drinks the poison and dies.

Wolfstein is subsequently elected Captain by the other bandits after the murder of Stiletto. He then is racked by dreams of the murdered Cavigni which fill him with dread and foreboding.
Days after the murder, Wolfstein seeks to seduce Serena. He observes her in prayer. She refuses his advances and pulls out a dagger. In response, Wolfstein unsheaths his sword and stabs her to death.

Thunder was heard in the cell. The Prince of Terror then appeared before him. A “strange and unnatural stench” infused the room as “the yawning gulf of hell” swallowed Wolfstein as blue flames swirled around his body.

The final paragraph concludes with a moral of the story. Plunging into despair and indulging in crime are not the ways to confront misfortune. The tenets of morality and truth should be diligently followed. Only “misery, disgrace and ruin” result when these principles are ignored.

'''Xenology''' is the scientific study of [[extraterrestrial life]]. Derived from the Greek ''xenos'', which as a substantive has the meaning "stranger, wanderer, refugee" and as an adjective "foreign, alien, strange, unusual."&lt;ref&gt;Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', new (ninth) edition, with a supplement, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==

=== In science fiction ===
It is used to denote a hypothetical science whose object of study would be extraterrestrial societies developed by alien lifeforms. In science fiction criticism and studies the term has been advocated by writers such as [[David Brin]] ("Xenology: The New Science of Asking 'Who's Out There?'" ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Analog]]'', 26 April 1983)&lt;ref&gt;Brian M. Stableford, ''Science Fact and Science Fiction: An Encyclopedia'', Routledge, 2006, p. 571.&lt;/ref&gt; as an analogue of (terrestrial) [[ethnology]]. By extension the term may also refer to the fictional creation of "alternative humankinds".&lt;ref&gt;''Science Fact and Science Fiction: An Encyclopedia'', p. 571.&lt;/ref&gt;

Instances in which Xenology was referred to in a work of Science Fiction include the [[Arkady and Boris Strugatsky| Brothers Strugatsky's]] 1972 novel ''[[Roadside Picnic]]''. In section three of which one of the character's, a noble laureate by the name of Valentine Pillman, explains Xenology as "an unnatural mixture of science fiction and formal logic. At its core is a flawed assumption—that an alien race would be psychologically human."&lt;ref name="StrugatskyStrugatsky2016"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Arkady Strugatsky|author2=Boris Strugatsky|title=Roadside Picnic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4iwpDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT92|date=16 September 2016|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=978-1-365-40085-8|pages=92–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In cultural studies ===
The term xenology was employed by German [[Indologist]] [[Wilhelm Halbfass]] in his ''Indien und Europa, Perspektiven ihrer geistigen Begegnung'' (India and Europe: Perspectives on Their Spiritual Encounter) (1981)&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Halbfass, ''Indien und Europa, Perspektiven ihrer geistigen Begegnung'', Schwabe Verlag, Basel and Stuttgart, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; to denote the study of the ethnocentric views held by societies with regard to different classes of foreigner, in other words the positive or negative ways in which a given culture defines those outside or alien to it.&lt;ref&gt;Dermot Killingley, "Mlecchas, Yavanas and Heathens: Interacting Xenologies in Early Nineteenth-Century Calcutta," in ''Beyond Orientalism: The Work of Wilhelm Halbfass and its Impact on Indian and Cross-cultural Studies'', ed. Eli Franco, Karin Preisendanz, Editions Rodopi, Amsterdam, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Xenology is thus the study of the various modalities whereby self and otherness are defined "within a historically complex collision of cultures".&lt;ref&gt;Harvey P. Alper, review of ''Indien und Europa, Perspektiven ihrer geistigen Begegnung'', in ''Philosophy East and West'', Vol. 33, No. 2 (April, 1983), pp. 189-196&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In science ===
{{primary section|date=June 2017}}
[[Robert Freitas|Robert A. Freitas Jr.]] self-published a book on the subject, ''Xenology: An Introduction to the Scientific Study of Extraterrestrial Life, Intelligence, and Civilization'' (XRI, 1979). Freitas argued for the primacy of the term in the context of extraterrestrial life in a 1983 letter to the journal Nature.&lt;ref&gt;"Naming extraterrestrial life," Nature 301(13 January 1983):106 http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v301/n5896/full/301106a0.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Naming extraterrestrial life," Correspondence to Nature Vol. 301(13), 13 January 1983, p 106. http://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/NamingETL.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
