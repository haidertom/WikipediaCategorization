'''Selwyn Bougard''', now known as '''El-Divine Amir Bey''', better known by his stage name '''4th Disciple''', is a sonic artist and audio engineer who was one of the founding members of [[Killarmy]] and one of the best-known [[List of Wu-Tang Clan affiliates|Wu-Tang-affiliated producers]]. He is the only member of the Wu Elements to have worked on the Clan's first breakthrough album, as a mixer.

== Biography ==
After being a turntablist on the Wu-Tang Clan's debut album, ''[[Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)]]'', 4th Disciple co-produced and helped mix several tracks with the [[RZA]] on the first three Wu-Tang solo ventures by various artists, including co-production for "Sub Crazy" by [[Method Man]], "Damage" by [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]] as well as mixing credits for some of [[Raekwon]]'s ''[[Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...]]'', on the tracks "Criminology," "Guillotine (Swordz)," "Spot Rusherz," and "Wu-Gambinos." 4th Disciple then produced what was at the time only the second Wu-Tang track ever to lack a RZA production credit, when the [[Killah Priest]] solo track "B.I.B.L.E. (Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth)" was included on [[GZA]]'s ''[[Liquid Swords]]''. This led to five 4th Disciple productions appearing on the double album ''[[Wu-Tang Forever]]''.

After producing 15 of the 17 tracks on Killarmy's debut album, ''[[Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars]]'', and contributing significant production to the debut albums of [[Killah Priest]] (''[[Heavy Mental]]'') and [[Sunz of Man]] (''[[The Last Shall Be First (Sunz of Man album)|The Last Shall be First]]''), 4th Disciple's beats continued to appear on the solo work of the Clan members, including Inspectah Deck and Method Man. However, more recently, 4th Disciple has been concentrating his production on Killarmy, Sunz of Man, and their immediate affiliates rather than the Clan itself. [[The RZA]] did, in fact, produce the tracks "Wake Up" and "War Face" from ''[[Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars]]''

[[File:Sisyphus by von Stuck.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Sisyphus]], the symbol of the absurdity of existence, painting by [[Franz Stuck]] (1920)]]

&lt;!-- Do not edit the definition of Absurdism without first discussing on the Talk page - thank you for helping to maintain a neutral point of view --&gt;

In [[philosophy]], "'''the Absurd'''" refers to the conflict between the human tendency to seek [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|inherent value]] and [[meaning of life|meaning in life]] and the human inability to find any in a purposeless, meaningless or chaotic and irrational universe.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} The universe and the human mind do not each separately cause the Absurd, but rather, the Absurd arises by the contradictory nature of the two existing simultaneously. 

As a philosophy, '''absurdism''' furthermore explores the fundamental nature of the Absurd and how individuals, once becoming conscious of the Absurd, should respond to it. The absurdist philosopher [[Albert Camus]] stated that individuals should embrace the absurd condition of human existence while also defiantly continuing to explore and search for meaning.&lt;ref name="CamusMyth"&gt;{{cite book|last=Camus|first=Albert|authorlink=Albert Camus|title=Myth of Sisyphus and Other Essays|publisher=Vintage Books|isbn=0-679-73373-6|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Absurdism shares some concepts, and a common theoretical template, with [[existentialism]] and [[nihilism]]. It has its origins in the work of the 19th-century [[Denmark|Danish]] philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]], who chose to confront the crisis that humans face with the Absurd by developing his own [[Philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard|existentialist philosophy]].&lt;ref name="Kierkegaard"&gt;Stewart, Jon (2011). Kierkegaard and Existentialism. Farnham, England: Ashgate. {{ISBN|978-1-4094-2641-7}}. pp. 76–78.&lt;/ref&gt; Absurdism as a belief system was born of the European existentialist movement that ensued, specifically when Camus rejected certain aspects of that philosophical line of thought&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Solomon |first=Robert C. |authorlink=Robert C. Solomon |title=From Rationalism to Existentialism: The Existentialists and Their Nineteenth Century Backgrounds |publisher=[[Rowman and Littlefield]] |year=2001 |page=245 |isbn=0-7425-1241-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and published his essay ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]''. The aftermath of [[World War II]] provided the social environment that stimulated absurdist views and allowed for their popular development, especially in the devastated country of [[France]].

{{Also|Existentialism#The Absurd}}
In absurdist philosophy, the Absurd arises out of the fundamental disharmony between the individual's search for meaning and the [[meaning (existential)|meaninglessness]] of the universe. As beings looking for meaning in a meaningless world, humans have three ways of resolving the dilemma. Kierkegaard and Camus describe the solutions in their works, ''[[The Sickness Unto Death]]'' (1849) and ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]'' (1942), respectively:

*[[Suicide]] (or, "escaping existence"): a solution in which a person ends one's own life. Both Kierkegaard and Camus dismiss the viability of this option. Camus states that it does not counter the Absurd. Rather, in the act of ending one's existence, one's existence only becomes more absurd.
*[[Religious]], [[spirtuality|spiritual]], or abstract belief in a [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendent]] realm, being, or idea: a solution in which one believes in the existence of a reality that is beyond the Absurd, and, as such, has meaning. Kierkegaard stated that a belief in anything beyond the Absurd requires an irrational but perhaps necessary religious "leap" into the intangible and empirically unprovable (now commonly referred to as a "[[leap of faith]]"). However, Camus regarded this solution, and others, as "philosophical suicide".
*Acceptance of the Absurd: a solution in which one accepts the Absurd and continues to live in spite of it. Camus endorsed this solution, believing that by accepting the Absurd, one can achieve the greatest extent of one's freedom. By recognizing no religious or other moral constraints, and by revolting against the Absurd (through meaning-making) while simultaneously accepting it as unstoppable, one could find contentment through the transient personal meaning constructed in the process. Kierkegaard, on the other hand, regarded this solution as "demoniac madness": "''He rages most of all at the thought that eternity might get it into its head to take his misery from him!''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kierkegaard|first=Søren|authorlink=Søren Kierkegaard|title=The Sickness Unto Death|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1941}} Part I, Ch. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to existentialism and nihilism==
Absurdism originated from (as well as alongside) the 20th-century strains of [[existentialism]] and [[nihilism]]; it shares some prominent starting points with both, though also entails conclusions that are uniquely distinct from these other schools of thought. All three arose from the human experience of anguish and confusion stemming from the Absurd: the apparent meaninglessness in a world in which humans, nevertheless, are compelled to find or create meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/nihilism/#H3 |title=Nihilism |author=Alan Pratt |date=April 23, 2001 |work=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=[[Embry-Riddle University]] |accessdate=February 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three schools of thought diverge from there. Existentialists have generally advocated the individual's construction of his or her own meaning in life as well as the [[free will]] of the individual. Nihilists, on the contrary, contend that "it is futile to seek or to affirm meaning where none can be found."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=9VnPgFiW0CIC&amp;oi |title=The Specter of the Absurd: Sources and Criticisms of Modern Nihilism |author=Donald A. Crosby |date=July 1, 1988 |publisher=State University of New York Press |accessdate=January 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Absurdists, following Camus's formulation, hesitantly allow the possibility for some meaning or value in life, but are neither as certain as existentialists are about the value of one's own constructed meaning nor as nihilists are about the total inability to create meaning. Absurdists following Camus also devalue or outright reject free will, encouraging merely that the individual live defiantly and authentically ''in spite of'' the psychological tension of the Absurd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Albert Camus|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/camus/|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|quote=What is the Camusean alternative to suicide or hope? The answer is to live without escape and with integrity, in “revolt” and defiance, maintaining the tension intrinsic to human life}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Camus himself passionately worked to counter [[nihilism]], as he explained in his essay "[[The Rebel (book)|The Rebel]]," while he also categorically rejected the label of "existentialist" in his essay "Enigma" and in the compilation ''The Lyrical and Critical Essays of Albert Camus'', though he was, and still is, often broadly characterized by others as an existentialist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Solomon|first=Robert C. |authorlink=Robert C. Solomon|title=From Rationalism to Existentialism: The Existentialists and Their Nineteenth Century Backgrounds |publisher=[[Rowman and Littlefield]] |year=2001 |page=245 |isbn=0-7425-1241-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both existentialism and absurdism entail consideration of the practical applications of becoming conscious of the truth of [[existential nihilism]]: i.e., how a driven seeker of meaning should act when suddenly confronted with the seeming concealment, or downright absence, of meaning in the universe. Camus's own understanding of the world (e.g., "a benign indifference", in ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]''), and every vision he had for its progress,{{example needed|date=November 2018}} however, sets him apart from the general existentialist trend.

Such a chart represents some of the overlap and tensions between existentialist and absurdist approaches to meaning.  While absurdism can be seen as a kind of response to existentialism, it can be debated exactly how substantively the two positions differ from each other.  The existentialist, after all, doesn't deny the reality of death.  But the absurdist seems to reaffirm the way in which death ultimately nullifies our meaning-making activities, a conclusion the existentialists seem to resist through various notions of posterity or, in Sartre's case, participation in a grand humanist project.

==Søren Kierkegaard==
{{Main|Philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard}}
[[Image:Kierkegaard.jpg|thumb|Kierkegaard designed the relationship framework based (in part) on how a person reacts to [[existential despair|despair]]. Absurdist philosophy fits into the 'despair of defiance' rubric.&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard, Søren. ''The Sickness Unto Death''. ''Kierkegaard wrote about all four viewpoints in his works at one time or another, but the majority of his work leaned towards what would later become absurdist and theistic existentialist views.''&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A century before [[Albert Camus|Camus]], the 19th century Danish philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]] wrote extensively about the absurdity of the world. In his journals, Kierkegaard writes about the absurd:

{{quotation|What is the Absurd? It is, as may quite easily be seen, that I, a rational being, must act in a case where my reason, my powers of reflection, tell me: you can just as well do the one thing as the other, that is to say where my reason and reflection say: you cannot act and yet here is where I have to act... The Absurd, or to act by virtue of the absurd, is to act upon faith ... I must act, but reflection has closed the road so I take one of the possibilities and say: This is what I do, I cannot do otherwise because I am brought to a standstill by my powers of reflection.&lt;ref&gt;Dru, Alexander. ''The Journals of Søren Kierkegaard'', [[Oxford University Press]], 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;|Kierkegaard, Søren|Journals|1849}}

Here is another example of the Absurd from his writings: {{Quotation|What, then, is the absurd? The absurd is that the eternal truth has come into existence in time, that God has come into existence, has been born, has grown up. etc., has come into existence exactly as an individual human being, indistinguishable from any other human being, in as much as all immediate recognizability is pre-Socratic paganism and from the Jewish point of view is idolatry.&lt;br&gt;—Kierkegaard, ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'', 1846, Hong 1992, p. 210}}

How can this absurdity be held or believed? Kierkegaard says: {{Quotation|I gladly undertake, by way of brief repetition, to emphasize what other pseudonyms have emphasized. The absurd is not the absurd or absurdities without any distinction (wherefore Johannes de Silentio: "How many of our age understand what the absurd is?"). The absurd is a category, and the most developed thought is required to define the Christian absurd accurately and with conceptual correctness. The absurd is a category, the negative criterion, of the divine or of the relationship to the divine. When the believer has faith, the absurd is not the absurd — faith transforms it, but in every weak moment it is again more or less absurd to him. The passion of faith is the only thing which masters the absurd — if not, then faith is not faith in the strictest sense, but a kind of knowledge. The absurd terminates negatively before the sphere of faith, which is a sphere by itself. To a third person the believer relates himself by virtue of the absurd; so must a third person judge, for a third person does not have the passion of faith. Johannes de Silentio has never claimed to be a believer; just the opposite, he has explained that he is not a believer — in order to illuminate faith negatively.&lt;br&gt;—''Journals of Søren Kierkegaard'' X6B 79&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Naturalthinker.com|title=Søren Kierkegaard|url=http://www.naturalthinker.net/trl/texts/Kierkegaard,Soren/JournPapers/X_6_B.html|accessdate=2016-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kierkegaard provides an example in ''[[Fear and Trembling]]'' (1843), which was published under the pseudonym ''[[Johannes de Silentio]]''. In the story of [[Abraham]] in the Book of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], Abraham is told by [[God]] to [[Binding of Isaac|kill his son]] [[Isaac]]. Just as Abraham is about to kill Isaac, an angel stops Abraham from doing so. Kierkegaard believes that through virtue of the absurd, Abraham, defying all reason and ethical duties ("you cannot act"), got back his son and reaffirmed his faith ("where I have to act").&lt;ref&gt;Silentio, Johannes de. ''Fear and Trembling'', Denmark, 1843&lt;/ref&gt;

Another instance of absurdist themes in Kierkegaard's work appears in ''[[The Sickness Unto Death]]'', which Kierkegaard signed with pseudonym ''[[Anti-Climacus]]''. Exploring the forms of despair, Kierkegaard examines the type of despair known as defiance.&lt;ref&gt;''Sickness Unto Death'', Ch.3, part B, sec. 2&lt;/ref&gt; In the opening quotation reproduced at the beginning of the article, Kierkegaard describes how such a man would endure such a defiance and identifies the three major traits of the Absurd Man, later discussed by Albert Camus: a rejection of escaping existence (suicide), a rejection of help from a higher power and acceptance of his absurd (and despairing) condition.

According to Kierkegaard in his autobiography ''[[The Point of View of My Work as an Author]]'', most of his pseudonymous writings are not necessarily reflective of his own opinions. Nevertheless, his work anticipated many absurdist themes and provided its theoretical background.

==Albert Camus==
Though the notion of the 'absurd' pervades all [[Albert Camus]]'s writing, ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]'' is his chief work on the subject. In it, Camus considers absurdity as a confrontation, an opposition, a conflict or a "divorce" between two ideals. Specifically, he defines the human condition as absurd, as the confrontation between man's desire for significance, meaning and clarity on the one hand&amp;nbsp;– and the silent, cold universe on the other. He continues that there are specific human experiences evoking notions of absurdity. Such a realization or encounter with the absurd leaves the individual with a choice: [[suicide]], a [[leap of faith]], or recognition. He concludes that recognition is the only defensible option.&lt;ref name="CamusMyth"/&gt;

For Camus, suicide is a "confession" that life is not worth living; it is a choice that implicitly declares that life is "too much." Suicide offers the most basic "way out" of absurdity: the immediate termination of the self and its place in the universe.

The absurd encounter can also arouse a "leap of faith," a term derived from one of Kierkegaard's early pseudonyms, ''Johannes de Silentio'' (although the term was not used by Kierkegaard himself),&lt;ref name=CC&gt;"The Kierkegaardian Leap" in ''The Cambridge Companion to Kierkegaard''.&lt;/ref&gt; where one believes that there is more than the rational life (aesthetic or ethical). To take a "leap of faith," one must act with the "virtue of the absurd" (as ''Johannes de Silentio'' put it), where a suspension of the ethical may need to exist. This faith has no expectations, but is a flexible power initiated by a recognition of the absurd. (Although at some point, one recognizes or encounters the existence of the Absurd and, in response, actively ignores it.) However, Camus states that because the leap of faith escapes rationality and defers to abstraction over personal experience, the leap of faith is not absurd. Camus considers the leap of faith as "philosophical suicide," rejecting both this and physical suicide.&lt;ref name=CC /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Camus, ''Myth of Sisyphus'', p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

Lastly, a person can choose to embrace the absurd condition. According to Camus, one's freedom&amp;nbsp;– and the opportunity to give life meaning&amp;nbsp;– lies in the recognition of absurdity. If the absurd experience is truly the realization that the universe is fundamentally devoid of absolutes, then we as individuals are truly free. "To live without appeal,"&lt;ref&gt;Camus, ''Myth of Sisyphus'', p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; as he puts it, is a philosophical move to define absolutes and universals subjectively, rather than objectively. The freedom of humans is thus established in a human's natural ability and opportunity to create their own meaning and purpose; to decide (or think) for him- or herself. The individual becomes the most precious unit of existence, representing a set of unique ideals that can be characterized as an entire universe in its own right. In acknowledging the absurdity of seeking any inherent meaning, but continuing this search regardless, one can be happy, gradually developing meaning from the search alone.

Camus states in ''The Myth of Sisyphus'': "Thus I draw from the absurd three consequences, which are my revolt, my freedom, and my passion. By the mere activity of consciousness I transform into a rule of life what was an invitation to death, and I refuse suicide."&lt;ref&gt;Camus, ''Myth of Sisyphus'', p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; "Revolt" here refers to the refusal of suicide and search for meaning despite the revelation of the Absurd; "Freedom" refers to the lack of imprisonment by religious devotion or others' moral codes; "Passion" refers to the most wholehearted experiencing of life, since hope has been rejected, and so he concludes that every moment must be lived fully.

==The meaning of life==
According to absurdism, humans historically attempt to find [[Meaning of life|meaning in their lives]]. Traditionally, this search results in one of two conclusions: either that life is meaningless, or life contains within it a purpose set forth by a [[deity|higher power]]—a belief in [[God]], or adherence to some [[religion]] or other abstract concept. 

===Elusion===
Camus perceives filling the void with some invented belief or meaning as a mere "act of eluding"&amp;mdash;that is, avoiding or escaping rather than acknowledging and embracing the Absurd. To Camus, elusion is a fundamental flaw in [[religion]], [[existentialism]], and various other schools of thought. If the individual eludes the Absurd, then he or she can never confront it.
Camus also concedes that elusion is the most common.

===God===
Even with a spiritual power as the answer to meaning, another question arises: What is the purpose of a belief in God? [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]] believed that there is no human-comprehensible purpose of God, making faith in God absurd itself. Camus on the other hand states that to believe in God is to "deny one of the terms of the contradiction" between humanity and the universe (and is therefore not absurd but what he calls "philosophical suicide"). Camus (as well as Kierkegaard), though, suggests that while absurdity does not lead to belief in God, neither does it lead to the denial of God. Camus notes, "I did not say 'excludes God', which would still amount to asserting".&lt;ref&gt;Camus, ''Myth of Sisyphus'', p. 40, note 7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal meaning===
For Camus, the beauty people encounter in life makes it worth living. People may create meaning in their own lives, which may not be the [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] meaning of life (if there is one), but can still provide something to strive for. However, he insisted that one must always maintain an [[irony|ironic]] distance between this invented meaning and the knowledge of the absurd, lest the fictitious meaning take the place of the absurd.

===Freedom===
[[Liberty|Freedom]] cannot be achieved beyond what the absurdity of existence permits; however, the closest one can come to being absolutely free is through acceptance of the Absurd. Camus introduced the idea of "acceptance without resignation" as a way of dealing with the recognition of absurdity, asking whether or not man can "live without appeal", while defining a "conscious revolt" against the avoidance of absurdity of the world. In a world devoid of higher meaning or judicial afterlife, the human nature becomes as close to absolutely free as is humanly possible.

===Hope===
The rejection of hope, in absurdism, denotes the refusal to believe in anything more than what this absurd life provides. Hope, Camus emphasizes, however, has nothing to do with despair (meaning that the two terms are not [[opposite (semantics)|opposite]]s). One can still live fully while rejecting hope, and, in fact, can only do so ''without'' hope. Hope is perceived by the absurdist as another fraudulent method of evading the Absurd, and by not having hope, one is motivated to live every fleeting moment to the fullest. In the words of [[Nikos Kazantzakis]]'s [[epitaph]]: "I hope for nothing.  I fear nothing.  I am free."

===Integrity===
The absurdist is not guided by [[morality]], but rather, by their own [[integrity]]. The absurdist is, in fact, [[Amorality|amoral]] (though not necessarily [[Morality|immoral]]). The Absurdist's view of morality implies an unwavering sense of definite right and wrong at all times, while integrity implies honesty with one's self and consistency in the motivations of one's actions and decisions.

[[File:Chimp Brain in a jar.jpg|thumb|right|This old jar containing a chimpanzee brain is currently preserved in the [[Science Museum, London|Science Museum of London]]. It is still labeled ''Anthropopithecus troglodytes'', [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial name]] replaced in 1895 by ''[[Common chimpanzee|Pan troglodytes]]''.]]
The terms '''''Anthropopithecus''''' ([[Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville|Blainville]], 1839) and '''''Pithecanthropus''''' ([[Ernst Haeckel|Haeckel]], 1868) are obsolete taxa describing either [[chimpanzee]]s or [[archaic humans]]. Both are derived from Greek  ἄνθρωπος (anthropos, "man") and πίθηκος (píthēkos, "ape" or "monkey"), translating to "man-ape" and "ape-man", respectively.

''Anthropopithecus'' was originally coined to describe the [[chimpanzee]] and is now a [[Synonym (taxonomy)|junior synonym]] of ''[[Pan (genus)|Pan]]''. It had been also used to describe several other extant and extinct species, among others the fossil [[Java Man]]. Very quickly, the latter was re-assigned to ''Pithecanthropus'', originally coined to refer to a theoretical "[[Transitional fossil|missing link]]". ''Pithecanthropus'' is now classed as ''[[Homo erectus]]'', thus a junior synonym of ''[[Homo]]''.

== History ==
The [[genus]] ''Anthropopithecus'' was first proposed in 1839 by the French [[Zoology|zoologist]] and [[Anatomy|anatomist]] [[Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville|Henri-Marie Ducrotay de Blainville]] (1777–1850) in order to give a genus name to some [[chimpanzee]] material that he was studying at the time.&lt;ref name="Wiley-Blackwell-Encyclopedia-Human-Evolution"&gt;Bernard Wood ''et alii'', ''Wiley-Blackwell Encyclopedia of Human Evolution'', June 2013 (single-volume paperback version of the original 2011 2-volume edition), 1056 pp.; {{ISBN|978-1-1186-5099-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the genus ''Anthropopithecus'' was established by De Blainville in 1839, the British [[surgeon]] and [[Natural history|naturalist]] [[John Bland-Sutton]] (1855–1936) proposed the [[species]] name ''Anthropopithecus troglodytes'' in 1883 to designate the [[common chimpanzee]]. However, the genus ''Pan'' had already been attributed to chimpanzees in 1816 by the German naturalist [[Lorenz Oken]] (1779–1851). Since any earlier [[Binomial nomenclature|nomenclature]] prevails over subsequent nomenclatures, the genus ''Anthropopithecus'' definitely lost its validity in 1895,&lt;ref name="Tubbs"&gt;P. K. Tubbs, "Opinion 1368 The generic names ''Pan'' and ''Panthera'' (Mammalia, Carnivora): available as from Oken, 1816", ''Bulletin of Zoological Nomenclature'' (1985), volume 42, pp 365-370&lt;/ref&gt; becoming from that date a [[junior synonym]] of the genus ''Pan''.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;According to the current international consensus, the genus ''Pan'' includes two [[species]]: the common chimpanzee (''[[Common chimpanzee|Pan troglodytes]]'') and the bonobo or dwarf chimpanzee (''[[Bonobo|Pan paniscus]]'').&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1879,&lt;ref&gt;''Pôle international de la Préhistoire'' "[http://www.pole-prehistoire.com/index.php/fr/decouvrir/les-ressources-en-ligne/espace-documentation/86-bibliotheque-numerique/148-le-prehistorique-antiquite-de-l-homme-gabriel-de-mortillet ''Le Préhistorique, antiquité de l'homme'' / Gabriel de Mortillet]" {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; the French [[Archaeology|archaeologist]] and [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Louis Laurent Gabriel de Mortillet|Gabriel de Mortillet]] (1821–1898) proposed the term ''Anthropopithecus'' to designate a "[[Transitional fossil|missing link]]", a hypothetical intermediate between ape and man that lived in the [[Tertiary]] and that supposedly, following De Mortillet's theory, produced [[eolith]]s.&lt;ref name="Mortillet"&gt;[[Louis Laurent Gabriel de Mortillet|Gabriel de Mortillet]], ''Le Préhistorique, antiquité de l''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''homme'', Bibliothèque des sciences contemporaines, 2nd edition, Paris, C. Reinwald, 1885, 642 p. {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his work of 1883 ''Le Préhistorique, antiquité de l&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;homme'' (''The Prehistoric: Man's Antiquity'', below quoted after the 2nd edition, 1885&lt;ref name="Mortillet"/&gt;), De Mortillet writes:

{{quote|''Nous sommes donc forcément conduits à admettre, par une déduction logique tirée de l’observation directe des faits, que les animaux intelligents qui savaient faire du feu et tailler des pierres à l’époque tertiaire, n’étaient pas des hommes dans l’acception géologique et paléontologique du mot, mais des animaux d’un autre genre, des précurseurs de l’homme dans l’échelle des êtres, précurseurs auxquels j’ai donné le nom d’Anthropopithecus. Ainsi, par le seul raisonnement, solidement appuyé sur des observations précises, nous sommes arrivés à découvrir d’une manière certaine un être intermédiaire entre les anthropoïdes actuels et l’homme''.&lt;ref name="Mortillet"/&gt;}}

{{quote|We are therefore forced to admit, as a consequence of a logical deduction drawn from the direct observation of the facts, that intelligent animals who knew how to make fire and cut stones in the Tertiary Period, were not men in the geological and paleontological sense of the word, but animals of another kind, precursors of Man in the [[Great chain of being|chain of beings]], precursors to whom I gave the name ''Anthropopithecus''. Thus, by reasoning alone, firmly supported by precise observations, we have come to discover with certainty a being intermediate between the present [[Simian|anthropoids]] and Man.}}

When in 1905 the French [[Paleontology|paleontologist]], [[Paleoanthropology|paleoanthropologist]] and [[geologist]] [[Marcellin Boule]] (1861–1942) published a paper demonstrating that the eoliths were in fact [[geofact]]s produced by natural phenomena ([[freezing]], [[Metamorphic rock|pressure]], [[Wildfire|fire]]), the argument proposed by De Mortillet fell into disrepute and his definition of the term ''Anthropopithecus'' was dropped.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcellin Boule]], "''L''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''origine des éolithes''", ''L''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''Anthropologie'' (1905), tome 16, pp. 257–267 {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the chimpanzee meaning of the genus persisted throughout the [[19th century]], even to the point of being a genus name attributed to [[fossil]] [[Biological specimen|specimens]]. For example, a fossil primate discovered in 1878 by the British [[Malacology|malacologist]] [[William Theobald]] (1829-1908) in the [[Punjab, Pakistan|Pakistani Punjab]] in [[British Raj|British India]] was first named ''Palaeopithecus'' in 1879 but later renamed ''Anthropopithecus sivalensis'', assuming that these remains had to be brought back to the chimpanzee genus as the latter was being understood at the time. A famous example of a fossil ''Anthropopithecus'' is that of the [[Java Man]], discovered in 1891 in [[Trinil]], nearby the [[Solo River]], in [[East Java]], by Dutch physician and anatomist [[Eugène Dubois]], who named the discovery with the scientific name ''Anthropopithecus erectus''. This Dubois paper, written during the last quarter of 1892, was published by the Dutch government in 1893. In those early 1890s, the term ''Anthropopithecus'' was still being used by zoologists as the genus name of chimpanzees, so Dubois' ''Anthropopithecus erectus'' came to mean something like "the upright chimpanzee", or "the chimpanzee standing up". However, a year later, in 1893, Dubois considered that some anatomical characters proper to humans made necessary the attribution of these remains to a genus different than ''Anthropopithecus'' and he renamed the specimen of Java with the name ''Pithecanthropus erectus'' (1893 paper, published in 1894). ''Pithecanthropus'' is a genus that German [[biologist]] [[Ernst Haeckel]] (1834-1919) had created in 1868.&lt;ref name="Wiley-Blackwell-Encyclopedia-Human-Evolution"/&gt; Years later, in the [[20th century]], the German [[physician]] and [[Paleoanthropology|paleoanthropologist]] [[Franz Weidenreich]] (1873-1948) compared in detail the characters of Dubois' Java Man, then named ''Pithecanthropus erectus'', with the characters of the [[Peking Man]], then named ''Sinanthropus pekinensis''. Weidenreich concluded in 1940 that because of their anatomical similarity with modern humans it was necessary to gather all these specimens of Java and China in a single species of the genus ''[[Homo]]'', the species ''[[Homo erectus]]''.&lt;ref name="Wiley-Blackwell-Encyclopedia-Human-Evolution"/&gt; By that time, the genus ''Anthropopithecus'' had already been abandoned since 1895 at the earliest.

== In popular culture ==
The term ''Anthropopithecus'' is scientifically obsolete in the present day but did become widespread in popular culture, mainly in [[France]] and [[Belgium]]:
* In his [[short story]] ''[[Gil Braltar]]'' (1887), [[Jules Verne]] uses the term ''anthropopithèque'' (''Anthropopithecus'') to describe the simian aspect of one his characters, General McKackmale:
{{quote|''Il dormait bien, le général Mac Kackmale, sur ses deux oreilles, plus longues que ne le comporte l’ordonnance. Avec ses bras démesurés, ses yeux ronds, enfoncés sous de rudes sourcils, sa face encadrée d’une barbe rêche, sa physionomie grimaçante, ses gestes d’'''anthropopithèque''', le prognathisme extraordinaire de sa mâchoire, il était d’une laideur remarquable, – même chez un général anglais. Un vrai singe, excellent militaire, d’ailleurs, malgré sa tournure simiesque.''}}
{{quote|He slept well, did General MacKackmale, with both eyes shut, though longer than was permitted by regulations. With his long arms, his round eyes deeply set under their beetling brows, his face embellished with a stubbly beard, his grimaces, his semi-human gestures,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The sentence ''ses gestes d’anthropopithèque'' was translated in 1959 by Idrisyn Oliver Evans as "his semi-human gestures".&lt;/ref&gt; the extraordinary jutting-out of his jaw, he was remarkably ugly, even for an English general. Something of a monkey but an excellent soldier nevertheless, in spite of his apelike appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Translated from the French by Idrisyn Oliver Evans –''The Best From Fantasy and Science Fiction'' (1959), 8th series, edited by Anthony Boucher, Ace Books, New York&lt;/ref&gt;}}
* In the science-fiction novel ''La Cité des Ténèbres'' (''The City of Darkness''), written by French journalist and writer [[Léon Groc]] in 1926, the ''anthropopithèques'' (''Anthropopithecuses'') are a large herd of ape-men having reached a very low degree of civilisation.
* The [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[Comics artist|comics author]] [[Hergé]] made the term ''anthropopithèque'' (''Anthropopithecus'') one of the numerous [[Profanity|swear words]] of [[Captain Haddock]] in the [[comic album]] series ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Algoud, ''Le Haddock illustré, l'intégrale des jurons du capitaine'', Casterman (collection "Bibliothèque de Moulinsart"), Brussels, November 1991, 93 p., 23,2cm x 15cm ; {{ISBN|978-2203017108}} {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
* In 2001, French singer [[Brigitte Fontaine]] wrote, sang and recorded the song titled ''Pipeau''.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The French word ''pipeau'' refers to a type of [[Pipe (instrument)|pipe]], but in French slang ''pipeau'' also refers to a lie.&lt;/ref&gt; In this song, the chorus repeats the term ''anthropopithèque'' (''Anthropopithecus'').

[[File:Carbone lewis.svg|thumb|100px|The [[Lewis structure]] of a [[carbon]] atom, showing its four [[valence electrons]]]]

[[Carbon]] is a key component of all known [[life]] on [[Earth]], representing approximately 45-50% of all dry biomass.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fao.org/forestry/17111/en/&lt;/ref&gt; Complex [[molecule]]s are made up of [[carbon]] [[chemical bond|bonded]] with other [[chemical element|elements]], especially [[oxygen]] and [[hydrogen]] and frequently also with [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]] and [[sulfur]]. Carbon is abundant on Earth. It is also lightweight and relatively small in size, making it easier for enzymes to manipulate carbon molecules.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} It is frequently assumed in [[astrobiology]] that if life exists elsewhere in the [[universe]], it will also be carbon-based.&lt;ref name=BC&gt;{{cite web | url = http://biocab.org/Astrobiology.html | title = Astrobiology | accessdate = 2011-01-17 | date = September 26, 2006 | publisher = Biology Cabinet}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/C003763/index.php?page=interview07 |title=Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons: An Interview With Dr. Farid Salama |accessdate=2008-10-20 |year=2000 |work=Astrobiology magazine |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620075201/http://library.thinkquest.org/C003763/index.php?page=interview07 |archivedate=2008-06-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics refer to this assumption as [[carbon chauvinism]].&lt;ref name =darling&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/C/carbon-based_life.html |title=Carbon-based life |accessdate=14 September 2007 |first=David|last=Darling |publisher=Encyclopedia of Life}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
Carbon forms a vast number of [[chemical compound|compounds]], more than any other element, with almost ten million compounds described to date,&lt;ref name=lanl&gt;"There are close to ten million known carbon compounds, many thousands of which are vital to organic and life processes." {{cite web|author=Chemistry Operations|date=December 15, 2003|url=http://periodic.lanl.gov/elements/6.html|title=Carbon|publisher=Los Alamos National Laboratory|accessdate=2008-10-09|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913063402/http://periodic.lanl.gov/elements/6.html |archivedate=2008-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and yet that number is but a fraction of the number of theoretically possible compounds under standard conditions. For this reason, carbon has often been referred to as the "king of the elements".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Deming |first=Anna |date=2010 |title=King of the elements? |journal=Nanotechnology |volume=21 |issue=30 |pages=300201 |doi=10.1088/0957-4484/21/30/300201 |pmid=20664156 |bibcode=2010Nanot..21D0201D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carbon is the 15th [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|most abundant element in the Earth's crust]], and the [[Abundance of the chemical elements|fourth most abundant element in the universe by mass]] after [[hydrogen]], [[helium]], and [[oxygen]]. Carbon's abundance, its unique diversity of [[organic compound]]s, and its unusual ability to form [[polymer]]s at the temperatures commonly encountered on [[Earth]] enables this element to serve as a common element of all known life. It is the second most abundant element in the [[human body]] by mass (about 18.5%) after oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Campbell Biology|last=Reece|first=Jane B.|date=31 October 2013|publisher=[[Pearson Education|Pearson]]|isbn=9780321775658|edition=10|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"What we normally think of as 'life' is based on chains of carbon atoms, with a few other atoms, such as nitrogen or phosphorus", per [[Stephen Hawking]] in a 2008 lecture, "carbon [...] has the richest chemistry." &lt;ref name=nasa&gt;{{cite web|author1=Stephen Hawking|title=Life in the Universe, 50th anniversary celebration of NASA|url=http://www.dailygalaxy.com/my_weblog/2011/05/stephen-hawking-on-non-carbon-based-alien-life.html|publisher=NASA|accessdate=28 August 2015|date=1 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The most important characteristics of carbon as a basis for the [[chemistry]] of life are, that it has four valence bonds, and that the energy required to make or break a bond is at an appropriate level for building molecules, which are stable and reactive.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} Carbon atoms bond readily to other carbon atoms; this allows the building of arbitrarily long complex molecules and [[polymers]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==Other candidates==
There are not many other elements which even appear to be promising candidates for supporting life, for example, processes such as [[metabolism]]. The most frequently suggested alternative is [[silicon]].&lt;ref name="Pace"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pace | first1 = NR | title = The universal nature of biochemistry. | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/98/3/805.full.pdf | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 98 | issue = 3 | pages = 805–8 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11158550 | pmc = 33372 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.98.3.805 | bibcode=2001PNAS...98..805P}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silicon is in the same group in the [[Periodic Table]] of [[chemical element|elements]], and has four [[valence bond theory|valence bonds]], and bonds to itself, generally in the form of [[crystal lattice]]s rather than long chains.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} It is considerably more electropositive than carbon. Silicon compounds do not readily [[Recombination_(chemistry)|recombine]] into different permutations in a manner that would plausibly support lifelike processes.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

== Key  molecules ==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}
The most notable groups of chemicals used in the processes of living organisms include:

* [[Protein]]s, which are the building blocks from which the structures of living organisms are constructed (this includes almost all [[enzyme]]s, which [[catalyst|catalyse]] organic chemical reactions)
* [[Nucleic acid]]s, which carry [[Genetics|genetic]] information
* [[Carbohydrate]]s, which store energy in a form that can be used by living [[cell (biology)|cells]]
* [[Lipid]]s, which also store energy, but in a more concentrated form, and which may be stored for extended periods in the bodies of animals

==Fiction==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}
Silicon has been a theme of non-carbon-based-life since it is somewhat similar to carbon in its chemical characteristics.  
In cinematic and literary [[science fiction]], when man-made machines cross from non-living to living, this new form would be an example of non-carbon-based life. Since the advent of the [[microprocessor]] in the late 1960s, these machines are often classed as "silicon-based life". Another example of "silicon-based life" is the episode "The Devil in the Dark" from [[Star Trek: The Original Series]], in which a living rock creature's biochemistry is based on silicon. Also in The X-Files episode "Firewalker" where silicon based organism was discovered in a volcano.

In the [[2010_(film)|movie adaptation of Arthur C. Clarke's "2010" (1984)]] a character argues, "Whether we are based on carbon or on silicon makes no fundamental difference; we should each be treated with appropriate respect"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2010: Quotes|url=https://www.imdb.com/character/ch0002895/quotes|website=IMDb|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This quote may be the basis of [[Steve Jobs]]'s quip when he introduced [[Carbon (API)|Carbon within MacOS X]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WWDC '98|url=http://www.noteskey.com/events/1998_05.html|website=NotesKey|date = May 11, 1998|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, "Carbon. All life forms will be based on it."

'''Chirality''' {{IPAc-en|k|aɪ|ˈ|r|æ|l|ɪ|t|i}} is a geometric property of some molecules and ions.  A chiral molecule/ion is non-superposable on its [[mirror image]]. The presence of an [[asymmetric carbon|asymmetric carbon center]] is one of several structural features that induce [[chirality]] in organic and inorganic molecules.&lt;ref&gt;''Organic Chemistry'' (4th Edition) Paula Y. Bruice. Pearson Educational Books. {{ISBN|9780131407480}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Organic Chemistry'' (3rd Edition) Marye Anne Fox, James K. Whitesell Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers (2004)

The mirror images of a chiral molecule or ion are called [[enantiomer]]s or '''optical [[isomer]]s'''. Individual enantiomers are often designated as either [[Dextrorotation and levorotation|right-handed or left-handed]]. Chirality is an essential consideration when discussing the [[stereochemistry]] in [[organic chemistry|organic]] and [[inorganic chemistry]].  The concept is of great practical importance because most biomolecules and pharmaceuticals are chiral.

Chiral molecules and ions are described by various ways of designating their [[absolute configuration]], which codify either the entity's geometry or its [[polarimetry|ability to rotate plane-polarized light]], a common technique in studying chirality.

== Definition ==
Chirality is based on [[Molecular symmetry|molecular symmetry elements]]. Specifically, a chiral compound can contain no [[improper axis of rotation]] (S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), which includes planes of symmetry and inversion center. Chiral molecules are always dissymmetric (lacking S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) but not always asymmetric (lacking all symmetry elements except the trivial identity).  Asymmetric molecules are always chiral.&lt;ref&gt;Cotton, F. A., "Chemical Applications of Group Theory," John Wiley &amp; Sons: New York, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stereogenic centers==
{{main article|Stereogenic center}}
In general, chiral molecules have '''point chirality''' at a single ''stereogenic'' atom, which has four different substituents. The two enantiomers of such compounds are said to have different '''absolute configurations''' at this center. This center is thus stereogenic (i.e., a grouping within a molecular entity that may be considered a focus of stereoisomerism). The stereogenic atom (also known as the ''stereocenter'') is usually carbon, as in many biological molecules.  However a stereocenter can coincide with any atom, including metals (as in many chiral [[coordination compound]]s), phosphorus, or sulfur. The low barrier of [[nitrogen inversion]] make most ''N''-chiral amines (NRR′R″) impossible to resolve, but [[P-Chiral phosphine|''P''-chiral phosphines]] (PRR′R″) as well as S-chiral sulfoxides (OSRR′) are optically stable.
[[File:R-BINOL-2D-skeletal.png|thumb|144px|right|[[1,1'-Bi-2-naphthol|1,1′-Bi-2-naphthol]] is an example of a molecule lacking point chirality.]]
While the presence of a stereogenic atom describes the great majority of chiral molecules, many variations and exceptions exist. For instance it is not necessary for the chiral substance to have a stereogenic atom.  Examples include 1-bromo-3-chloro-5-fluoro[[adamantane]], methylethylphenyl[[tetrahedrane]], certain [[calixarenes]] and [[fullerenes]], which have [[inherent chirality]].  The [[C2-Symmetric ligands|C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetric species]] [[1,1'-Bi-2-naphthol|1,1′-bi-2-naphthol]] (BINOL), 1,3-dichloro[[Propadiene|allene]] have [[axial chirality]]. (''E'')-[[cyclooctene]] and many [[ferrocene]]s have [[planar chirality]].

When the optical [[Levorotation and dextrorotation|rotation]] for an enantiomer is too low for practical measurement, the species is said to exhibit [[cryptochirality]].

Even isotopic differences must be considered when examining chirality. Illustrative is the derivative of [[benzyl alcohol]] PhCHDOH, which is chiral. The ''S'' enantiomer has [''α'']&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; = +0.715°.&lt;ref&gt;{{note|Streitwieser}}{{cite journal |author1=Streitwieser, A., Jr. |author2=Wolfe, J. R., Jr. |author3=Schaeffer, W.

==In biochemistry==
Many biologically active molecules are chiral, including the naturally occurring [[amino acid]]s (the building blocks of [[protein]]s) and [[sugar]]s. In biological systems, most of these compounds are of the same chirality: most amino acids are [[Dextrorotation and levorotation|levorotatory]] ({{smallcaps all|L}}) and sugars are [[Dextrorotation and levorotation|dextrorotatory]] ({{smallcaps all|D}}). Typical naturally occurring proteins are made of {{smallcaps all|L}}-amino acids and are known as ''left-handed proteins''; the comparably rarer {{smallcaps all|D}}-amino acids produce ''right-handed proteins''.

The origin of this [[homochirality]] in [[biology]] is the subject of much debate.&lt;ref name=Meierhenrich08&gt;{{cite book | author= Meierhenrich, Uwe J.  | year= 2008 | title= Amino acids and the Asymmetry of Life | edition = | location = Berlin, GER | publisher = Springer | isbn= 3540768858 | chapter =  | pages = | url = | access-date = | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most scientists believe that Earth life's "choice" of chirality was purely random, and that if carbon-based life forms exist elsewhere in the universe, their chemistry could theoretically have opposite chirality. However, there is some suggestion that early amino acids could have formed in comet dust. In this case, circularly polarised radiation (which makes up 17% of stellar radiation) could have caused the selective destruction of one chirality of amino acids, leading to a selection bias which ultimately resulted in all life on Earth being homochiral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McKee |first=Maggie |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7895-space-radiation-may-select-amino-acids-for-life.html |title=Space radiation may select amino acids for life |publisher=New Scientist |date=2005-08-24 |accessdate=2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Meierhenrich Uwe J., Nahon Laurent, Alcaraz Christian, Hendrik Bredehöft Jan, Hoffmann Søren V., Barbier Bernard, Brack André | year = 2005 | title = Asymmetric Vacuum UV photolysis of the Amino Acid Leucine in the Solid State | url = | journal = Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. | volume = 44 | issue = | pages = 5630–5634 | doi = 10.1002/anie.200501311 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Enzyme]]s, which are chiral, often distinguish between the two enantiomers of a chiral substrate. One could imagine an enzyme as having a glove-like cavity that binds a substrate. If this glove is right-handed, then one enantiomer will fit inside and be bound, whereas the other enantiomer will have a poor fit and is unlikely to bind.

{{smallcaps all|L}}-forms of amino acids tend to be tasteless, whereas {{smallcaps all|D}}-forms tend to taste sweet.&lt;ref name=Meierhenrich08/&gt; [[Spearmint]] leaves contain the {{smallcaps all|L}}-enantiomer of the chemical [[carvone]] or ''R''-(−)-carvone and [[caraway]] seeds contain the {{smallcaps all|D}}-enantiomer or ''S''-(+)-carvone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/jf60176a035 | title=Chemical and sensory data supporting the difference between the odors of the enantiomeric carvones |author1=Theodore J.

Chirality is important in context of ordered phases as well, for example the addition of a small amount of an optically active molecule to a nematic phase (a phase that has long range orientational order of molecules) transforms that phase to a chiral nematic phase (or cholesteric phase). Chirality in context of such phases in polymeric fluids has also been studied in this context.&lt;ref name=Srinivasarao&gt;{{cite journal | author= Srinivasarao, M. | year = 1999 | title= Chirality and Polymers | journal = Current Opinion in Colloid &amp; Interface Science | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = 369–376 | doi = | url=  | quote =  }} {{full citation needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|Complex (chemistry)#Optical isomerism|l1=Complex (chemistry): Isomerism}}
Chirality is a symmetry property, not a characteristic of any part of the periodic table.  Thus many inorganic materials, molecules, and ions are chiral.  [[Quartz]] is an example from the mineral kingdom.  Such noncentric materials are of interest for applications in [[nonlinear optics]].

In the areas of [[coordination chemistry]] and [[organometallic chemistry]], chirality is pervasive and of practical importance.  A famous example is [[Tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) chloride|tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II)]] complex in which the three bipyridine ligands adopt a chiral propeller-like arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;von Zelewsky, A. (1995). ''Stereochemistry of Coordination Compounds.'' Chichester: John Wiley.. {{ISBN|047195599X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The two enantiomers of complexes such as [Ru(2,2′-bipyridine)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; may be designated as Λ (capital [[lambda]], the Greek version of "L") for a left-handed twist of the propeller described by the ligands, and Δ (capital [[delta (letter)|delta]], Greek "D") for a right-handed twist (pictured).

Chiral ligands confer chirality to a metal complex, as illustrated by metal-[[amino acid]] complexes.  If the metal exhibits catalytic properties, its combination with a chiral ligand is the basis of [[asymmetric catalysis]].&lt;ref&gt;Hartwig, J. F. Organotransition Metal Chemistry, from Bonding to Catalysis; University Science Books: New York, 2010. {{ISBN|189138953X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods and practices==

The term ''[[optical activity]]'' is derived from the interaction of chiral materials with polarized light. In a solution, the (−)-form, or [[levorotatory]] form, of an optical isomer [[Levorotation and dextrorotation|rotates]] the plane of a beam of [[Linear polarization|linearly polarized light]] [[counterclockwise]]. The (+)-form, or [[dextrorotatory]] form, of an optical isomer does the opposite. The rotation of light is measured using a [[polarimeter]] and is expressed as the optical rotation.

==Miscellaneous nomenclature==
* Any non-[[racemic]] chiral substance is called '''scalemic'''.  Scalemic materials can be enantiopure or enantioenriched.&lt;ref name=EllielChir97&gt;{{cite journal | author = Eliel, E.L. | year = 1997 | title = Infelicitous Stereochemical Nomenclatures | journal = Chirality | volume = 9 | pages = 428–430 | url =  https://www.uottawa.ca/publications/interscientia/inter.4/eliel/eliel.html | access-date = 5 February 2016 | doi=10.1002/(sici)1520-636x(1997)9:5/6&lt;428::aid-chir5&gt;3.3.co;2-e}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A chiral substance is '''enantiopure''' when only one of two possible enantiomers is present so that all molecules within a sample  have the same chirality sense. Use of '''homochiral''' as a synonym is strongly discouraged.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=asymmetric synthesis| file = E02072}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* A chiral substance is '''enantioenriched''' or '''heterochiral''' when its enantiomeric ratio is greater than 50:50 but less than 100:0.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=enantiomerically enriched (enantioenriched)| file = E02071}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Enantiomeric excess]] or '''e.e.''' is the difference between how much of one enantiomer is present compared to the other. For example, a sample with 40% e.e. of ''R'' contains 70% ''R'' and 30% ''S'' (70% − 30% = 40%).&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=enantiomer excess (enantiomeric excess)| file = E02070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The rotation of plane polarized light by chiral substances was first observed by [[Jean-Baptiste Biot]] in 1815,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Lakhtakia, A. (ed.) | title=Selected Papers on Natural Optical Activity (SPIE Milestone Volume 15) |publisher=SPIE | year=1990 }}{{full citation needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and gained considerable importance in the sugar industry, analytical chemistry, and pharmaceuticals. [[Louis Pasteur]] deduced in 1848 that this phenomenon has a molecular basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Pasteur, L. | title=Researches on the molecular asymmetry of natural organic products, English translation of French original, published by Alembic Club Reprints (Vol. 14, pp. 1–46) in 1905, facsimile reproduction by SPIE in a 1990 book | year=1848}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authors = Eliel, Ernest Ludwig; Wilen, Samuel H. &amp; Mander, Lewis N. | year = 1994 | title = Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds | edition = 1st | chapter = Chirality in Molecules Devoid of Chiral Centers (Chapter 14) | pages = | location = New York, NY, USA | publisher = Wiley &amp; Sons | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IyfwAAAAMAAJ | access-date = 2 February 2016 | isbn =  0471016705 | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''chirality'' itself was coined by [[Lord Kelvin]] in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Bentley, Ronald | year = 1995 | title = From Optical Activity in Quartz to Chiral Drugs: Molecular Handedness in Biology and Medicine. | journal=[[Perspectives in Biology and Medicine|Perspect.

'''Critterding''' is an artificial life simulator created by Bob Winckelmans and released as open source under the [[GNU General Public License|GPL]].

== Simulation ==
Critterding is a 3D/Physics based simulator, in which critters try to survive by developing a form of locomotion, find food and reproduce. Critters are made up of two types of body parts which are linked together by joints. The head, coloured red, is where the vision and mouth is located. The body segments are used for locomotion and display the colour of the critter. On an initial run, random seed critters are generated in a food rich environment, eventually a seed critter is generated that is able to eat and reproduce before dying. The new offspring have a chance to receive a mutation to either the body or neural network, some of which will be detrimental, causing the critter to fail and die while other mutations will be beneficial allowing it and its offspring to flourish over their siblings. Once the critter population reaches a preset maximum, the population is halved and the available food in the system is slightly reduced.

== Vision ==
Critters see with a 16 x 16 retina grid by default, though this value may be changed. Each pixel in the grid is able to see red, green, blue and alpha channels.

== Environment ==
Critterding supports 2 main environment types. A tray/petri dish style flatworld with walls to keep critters from falling into the void and the roundworld environment where critters and food are held on with planet like gravity. Beta 14 introduces .obj loading for fully customisable terrain, critter and food skins, skydome and dynamic lighting.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, bodies of living organisms begin to [[Decomposition|decompose]] shortly after death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://reptools.rutgers.edu/CarbonHypermedia/carbonq4.html|title=carbonQ1|website=reptools.rutgers.edu|access-date=2018-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Death – particularly the death of [[human]]s – has commonly been considered a [[sadness|sad]] or unpleasant occasion, due to the [[affection]] for the being that has died and the termination of social and familial [[human bonding|bonds]] with the deceased. Other concerns include [[death anxiety (psychology)|fear of death]], [[necrophobia]], [[anxiety]], [[sorrow (emotion)|sorrow]], [[grief]], [[emotional pain]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[sympathy]], [[compassion]], [[solitude]], or [[saudade]]. Many cultures and religions have the idea of an [[afterlife]], and also hold the idea of [[Heaven|reward]] or [[Judgement (afterlife)|judgement]] and [[Hell|punishment for past sin]].

== Etymology ==
The word death comes from [[Old English]] ''dēaþ'', which in turn comes from Proto-Germanic *''dauþuz'' (reconstructed by etymological analysis). This comes from the Proto-Indo-European stem *''dheu-'' meaning the "process, act, condition of dying".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=death |title=Death |website=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013162848/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=death |archivedate=13 October 2016 |deadurl=no |accessdate=5 November 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept and symptoms of death, and varying degrees of delicacy used in discussion in public forums, have generated numerous scientific, legal, and socially acceptable terms or euphemisms for death.  When a person has died, it is also said they have ''passed away'', ''passed on'', ''expired'', or are ''gone'', among numerous other socially accepted, religiously specific, slang, and irreverent terms. Bereft of life, the dead person is then a ''corpse'', ''[[cadaver]]'', a ''body'', a ''set of remains'', and when all flesh has rotted away, a [[skeleton]]. The terms ''[[carrion]]'' and ''carcass'' can also be used, though these more often connote the remains of non-human animals.  As a polite reference to a dead person, it has become common practice to use the [[participle]] form of "decease", as in ''the deceased''; another noun form is ''decedent''.  The ashes left after a [[cremation]] are sometimes referred to by the [[neologism]] ''cremains'', a [[portmanteau]] of "cremation" and "remains".

== Senescence ==
[[File:Dead magpie.jpg|thumb|alt=A dead magpie|A dead [[Eurasian magpie]]]]

[[Senescence]] refers to a scenario when a living being is able to survive all calamities, but eventually dies due to causes relating to old age. Animal and plant cells normally reproduce and function during the whole period of natural existence, but the aging process derives from deterioration of cellular activity and ruination of regular functioning. Aptitude of cells for gradual deterioration and mortality means that cells are naturally sentenced to stable and long-term loss of living capacities, even despite continuing metabolic reactions and viability. In the United Kingdom, for example, nine out of ten of all the deaths that occur on a daily basis relates to senescence, while around the world it accounts for two-thirds of 150,000 deaths that take place daily (Hayflick &amp; Moody, 2003).

Almost all [[animal]]s who survive external hazards to their biological functioning eventually die from [[Senescence|biological aging]], known in life sciences as "senescence". Some organisms experience [[negligible senescence]], even exhibiting [[biological immortality]].  These include the jellyfish ''[[Turritopsis dohrnii]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jellyfishfacts.net/turritopsis-nutricula-immortal-jellyfish.html |title=Turritopsis nutricula (Immortal jellyfish) |publisher=Jellyfishfacts.net |accessdate=18 January 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013163459/http://www.jellyfishfacts.net/turritopsis-nutricula-immortal-jellyfish.html |archivedate=13 October 2016 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Hydra (genus)|hydra]], and the [[planarian]]. Unnatural causes of death include [[suicide]] and [[homicide]]. From all causes, roughly 150,000 people die around the world each day.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aubrey D.N.J |first=de Grey |authorlink=Aubrey de Grey |title=Life Span Extension Research and Public Debate: Societal Considerations |journal=Studies in Ethics, Law, and Technology |volume=1 |issue=1, Article 5 |year=2007 |url=http://www.sens.org/files/pdf/ENHANCE-PP.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.2202/1941-6008.1011 |accessdate=20 March 2009 |ref=harv |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013163622/http://www.sens.org/files/pdf/ENHANCE-PP.pdf |archivedate=13 October 2016|citeseerx=10.1.1.395.745 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, two thirds die directly or indirectly due to senescence, but in industrialized countries – such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany – the rate approaches 90%, i.e., nearly nine out of ten of all deaths are related to senescence.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011" /&gt;

[[Physiological]] death is now seen as a process, more than an event: conditions once considered indicative of death are now reversible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Crippen |first=David |website=Scientific American Surgery, Critical Care, April 2005 |url=http://www.sciamsurgery.com/sciamsurgery/institutional/payPerAdd.action?chapterId=part08_ch10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060624132446/http://www.acssurgery.com/abstracts/acs/acs0812.htm |archivedate=24 June 2006 |title=Brain Failure and Brain Death |accessdate=9 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where in the process a dividing line is drawn between life and death depends on factors beyond the presence or absence of [[vital signs]].

===Signs===
Signs of death or strong indications that a [[endotherm|warm-blooded animal]] is no longer alive are:
* [[Respiratory arrest]] (no [[breathing]])
* [[Cardiac arrest]] (no [[heart rate|pulse]])
* [[Brain death]] (no neuronal activity)
* {{lang|la|[[Pallor mortis]]}}, paleness which happens in the 15–120 minutes after death
* {{lang|la|[[Livor mortis]]}}, a settling of the blood in the lower (dependent) portion of the body
* {{lang|la|[[Algor mortis]]}}, the reduction in body temperature following death. This is generally a steady decline until matching ambient temperature
* {{lang|la|[[Rigor mortis]]}}, the limbs of the corpse become stiff (Latin ''rigor'') and difficult to move or manipulate
* [[Decomposition]], the reduction into simpler forms of matter, accompanied by a strong, unpleasant odor.

The concept of death is a key to human understanding of the phenomenon.&lt;ref name="MohammadSamir"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Samir Hossain Mohammad |author2=Gilbert Peter | year = 2010 | title = Concepts of Death: A key to our adjustment | url = | journal = Illness, Crisis and Loss | volume = 18 | issue = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many scientific approaches to the concept. For example, brain death, as practiced in medical science, defines death as a point in time at which brain activity ceases.&lt;ref name="MohammadSamir" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/dl/free/0078883601/680442/Additional_Lifespan_Development_Topics.pdf |title=Additional Lifespan Development Topics |publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies |accessdate=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/pdf/Fenwick%20Book%20Review%20Human%20Immortality;%20%20Death%20and%20Adjustment%20Hypotheses%20Elaborated.x.x.pdf Human Immortality; Death and Adjustment Hypotheses Elaborated.] Book Review by Dr. Peter Fenwick  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518024043/http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/pdf/Fenwick%20Book%20Review%20Human%20Immortality%3B%20%20Death%20and%20Adjustment%20Hypotheses%20Elaborated.x.x.pdf |date=18 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/pdf/Hossain%20Facing%20the%20Finality.pdf Facing the finality – Death and Adjustment Hypotheses] Dr. Mohammad Samir Hossain, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the challenges in defining death is in distinguishing it from [[life]]. As a point in time, death would seem to refer to the moment at which life ends. Determining when death has occurred is difficult, as cessation of life functions is often not simultaneous across organ systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |title=Crossing Over: How Science Is Redefining Life and Death |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2016/04/dying-death-brain-dead-body-consciousness-science/ |author=Henig, Robin Marantz |authorlink=Robin Marantz Henig |publisher=''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' |date=April 2016 |accessdate=23 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such determination therefore requires drawing precise conceptual boundaries between life and death. This is difficult, due to there being little consensus on how to define life. This general problem applies to the particular challenge of defining death in the context of medicine.

It is possible to define life in terms of consciousness. When consciousness ceases, a living organism can be said to have died. One of the flaws in this approach is that there are many organisms which are alive but probably not conscious (for example, single-celled organisms). Another problem is in defining consciousness, which has many different definitions given by modern scientists, psychologists and philosophers.  Additionally, many religious traditions, including [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] and [[Dharmic religions|Dharmic]] traditions, hold that death does not (or may not) entail the end of consciousness.  In certain cultures, death is more of a process than a single event. It implies a slow shift from one spiritual state to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=1991 |last=Metcalf |first=Peter |last2=Huntington |first2=Richard |title=Celebrations of Death: The Anthropology of Mortuary Ritual |publisher=Cambridge Press |place=New York}}{{page needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other definitions for death focus on the character of cessation of something.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary{{clarify|date=January 2014|reason=This is not a proper reference citation. Use Template:Cite web or similar to provide source details.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=January 2014|reason=&lt;nowiki&gt;This is not a proper reference citation. Use Template:Cite web or similar to provide source details. Use &lt;ref...&gt; inline in the article (see WP:CITE) to source the specific facts provided by this reference.&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} In this context "death" describes merely the state where something has ceased, for example, life. Thus, the definition of "life" simultaneously defines death.

Historically, attempts to define the exact moment of a human's death have been subjective, or imprecise. Death was once defined as the cessation of [[heart]]beat ([[cardiac arrest]]) and of [[breath]]ing, but the development of [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] and prompt [[defibrillation]] have rendered that definition inadequate because breathing and heartbeat can sometimes be restarted. Events which were [[causality|causally]] linked to death in the past no longer kill in all circumstances; without a functioning heart or lungs, life can sometimes be sustained with a combination of [[life support]] devices, [[organ transplants]] and [[artificial pacemaker]]s.

Today, where a definition of the moment of death is required, doctors and coroners usually turn to "brain death" or "biological death" to define a person as being dead; people are considered dead when the electrical activity in their brain ceases. It is presumed that an end of electrical activity indicates the end of [[consciousness]]. Suspension of consciousness must be permanent, and not transient, as occurs during certain [[non-rapid eye movement sleep|sleep]] stages, and especially a [[coma]]. In the case of sleep, [[electroencephalography|EEGs]] can easily tell the difference.

The category of "brain death" is seen as problematic by some scholars. For instance, Dr. Franklin Miller, senior faculty member at the Department of Bioethics, National Institutes of Health, notes: "By the late 1990s... the equation of brain death with death of the human being was increasingly challenged by scholars, based on evidence regarding the array of biological functioning displayed by patients correctly diagnosed as having this condition who were maintained on mechanical ventilation for substantial periods of time. These patients maintained the ability to sustain circulation and respiration, control temperature, excrete wastes, heal wounds, fight infections and, most dramatically, to gestate fetuses (in the case of pregnant "brain-dead" women)."&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller |first=F.G. |title=Death and organ donation: back to the future |journal=Journal of Medical Ethics |date=October 2009 |volume=35 |issue=10 |pages=616–620 |doi=10.1136/jme.2009.030627 |pmid=19793942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those people maintaining that only the [[neo-cortex]] of the brain is necessary for consciousness sometimes argue that only electrical activity should be considered when defining death. Eventually it is possible that the criterion for death will be the permanent and irreversible loss of [[cognition|cognitive]] function, as evidenced by the death of the [[cerebral cortex]]. All hope of recovering human thought and [[personality psychology|personality]] is then gone given current and foreseeable medical technology. At present, in most places the more conservative definition of death&amp;nbsp;– irreversible cessation of electrical activity in the whole brain, as opposed to just in the neo-cortex&amp;nbsp;– has been adopted (for example the [[Uniform Determination Of Death Act]] in the United States). In 2005, the [[Terri Schiavo case]] brought the question of brain death and artificial sustenance to the front of [[Politics of the United States|American politics]].

Even by whole-brain criteria, the determination of brain death can be complicated. EEGs can detect spurious electrical impulses, while certain [[drugs]], [[hypoglycemia]], [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], or [[hypothermia]] can suppress or even stop brain activity on a temporary basis. Because of this, hospitals have protocols for determining brain death involving EEGs at widely separated intervals under defined conditions.

===Legal===

The death of a person has legal consequences that may vary between different jurisdictions.
A [[death certificate]] is issued in most jurisdictions, either by a doctor, or by an administrative office upon presentation of a doctor's declaration of death.

[[File:Wiertz burial.jpg|thumb|[[Antoine Wiertz]]'s painting of a man buried alive]]
There are many anecdotal references to people being declared dead by physicians and then "coming back to life", sometimes days later in their own coffin, or when [[embalming]] procedures are about to begin. From the mid-18th century onwards, there was an upsurge in the public's fear of being mistakenly buried alive,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bondeson|2001|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; and much debate about the uncertainty of the signs of death. Various suggestions were made to test for signs of life before [[burial]], ranging from pouring vinegar and pepper into the corpse's mouth to applying red hot pokers to the feet or into the [[rectum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bondeson|2001|pp=56,&amp;nbsp;71.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 1895, the physician J.C. Ouseley claimed that as many as 2,700 people were buried prematurely each year in [[England]] and [[Wales]], although others estimated the figure to be closer to 800.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bondeson|2001|p=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cases of [[electric shock]], [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] (CPR) for an hour or longer can allow stunned [[nerve]]s to recover, allowing an apparently dead person to survive. People found unconscious under icy water may survive if their faces are kept continuously cold until they arrive at an [[emergency department|emergency room]].&lt;ref name=Limmer&gt;{{cite book|title=Brady Emergency Care AHA |publisher=Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0-13-159390-9 |author=Limmer, Dan; O'Keefe, Michael F.; Bergeron, J.

As medical technologies advance, ideas about when death occurs may have to be re-evaluated in light of the ability to restore a person to vitality after longer periods of apparent death (as happened when CPR and defibrillation showed that cessation of heartbeat is inadequate as a decisive indicator of death). The lack of electrical brain activity may not be enough to consider someone scientifically dead. Therefore, the concept of information-theoretic death&lt;ref name="InfoDeath"&gt;{{cite web

The leading cause of human death in [[developing countries]] is [[infectious disease]]. The leading causes in [[developed countries]] are [[atherosclerosis]] ([[heart disease]] and [[stroke]]), [[cancer]], and other diseases related to [[obesity]] and [[aging]]. By an extremely wide margin, the largest unifying cause of death in the developed world is biological aging,&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011" /&gt; leading to various complications known as [[aging-associated diseases]]. These conditions cause loss of [[homeostasis]], leading to [[cardiac arrest]], causing loss of [[oxygen]] and nutrient supply, causing irreversible deterioration of the [[Human brain|brain]] and other [[tissue (biology)|tissues]]. Of the roughly 150,000 people who die each day across the globe, about two thirds die of age-related causes.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011" /&gt; In industrialized nations, the proportion is much higher, approaching 90%.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011" /&gt; With improved medical capability, dying has become [[respite care|a condition to be managed]].

Many leading developed world causes of death can be postponed by [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] and [[physical fitness|physical activity]], but the accelerating incidence of disease with age still imposes limits on human [[longevity]]. The [[evolution of aging|evolutionary cause of aging]] is, at best, only just beginning to be understood.

[[Hans Selye|Selye]] proposed a unified non-specific approach to many causes of death. He demonstrated that [[Stress (biology)|stress]] decreases adaptability of an organism and proposed to describe the adaptability as a special resource, ''adaptation energy''. The animal dies when this resource is exhausted.&lt;ref name="SelyeAE2"&gt;Selye, H. (1938). Experimental evidence supporting the conception of "adaptation energy", Am. J.

Later on, Goldstone proposed the concept of a production or income of adaptation energy which may be stored (up to a limit), as a capital reserve of adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Goldstone B |year=1952 |title=The general practitioner and the general adaptation syndrome |journal=South African Medical Journal |volume=26 |issue=6 |pages=106–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent works,  adaptation energy is considered as an internal coordinate on the "dominant path" in the model of adaptation.

=== Autopsy ===
[[File:Rembrandt - The Anatomy Lesson of Dr Nicolaes Tulp.jpg|thumb|alt=A painting of an autopsy, by Rembrandt, entitled "The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp"|An autopsy is portrayed in ''[[The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp]]'', by [[Rembrandt]]]]
An [[autopsy]], also known as a ''postmortem examination'' or an ''obduction'', is a [[medical procedure]] that consists of a thorough [[Medical examination|examination]] of a human [[dead body|corpse]] to determine the cause and manner of a person's death and to evaluate any [[disease]] or [[injury]] that may be present. It is usually performed by a specialized [[physician|medical doctor]] called a [[pathologist]].

Autopsies are either performed for legal or medical purposes. A forensic autopsy is carried out when the cause of death may be a criminal matter, while a clinical or academic autopsy is performed to find the medical cause of death and is used in cases of unknown or uncertain death, or for research purposes. Autopsies can be further classified into cases where external examination suffices, and those where the body is dissected and an internal examination is conducted. Permission from [[next of kin]] may be required for internal autopsy in some cases. Once an internal autopsy is complete the body is generally reconstituted by sewing it back together. Autopsy is important in a medical environment and may shed light on mistakes and help improve practices.

A "necropsy" is an older term for a postmortem examination, unregulated, and not always a medical procedure. In modern times the term is more often used in the postmortem examination of the corpses of animals.

== Cryonics ==
[[File:Cryo surgery.jpg|thumb|Technicians prepare a body for cryopreservation in 1985.]]
{{Main|Cryonics}}

[[Cryonics]] (from Greek κρύος 'kryos-' meaning 'icy cold') is the [[cryopreservation|low-temperature preservation]] of animals and humans who cannot be sustained by contemporary medicine, with the hope that healing and [[wikt:resuscitate|resuscitation]] may be possible in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McKie|first=Robin |title=Cold facts about cryonics |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2002/jul/14/medicalscience.science |newspaper=[[The Oalobserver]] |date=13 July 2002 |accessdate=1 December 2013 |quote="Cryonics, which began in the Fifties, is the freezing – usually in liquid nitrogen – of human beings who have been legally declared dead. The aim of this process is to keep such individuals in a state of refrigerated limbo so that it may become possible in the future to resuscitate them, cure them of the condition that killed them, and then restore them to functioning life in an era when medical science has triumphed over the activities of the Banana Reaper."

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cryopreservation]] of people or large animals is not reversible with current technology.

== Life extension ==
{{Main|Life extension}}

Life extension refers to an increase in [[maximum life span|maximum]] or [[life expectancy|average lifespan]], especially in humans, by slowing down or reversing the [[senescence|processes of aging]]. Average lifespan is determined by vulnerability to [[accident]]s and age or lifestyle-related afflictions such as [[cancer]], or [[cardiovascular disease]]. Extension of average lifespan can be achieved by good [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], [[exercise]] and avoidance of hazards such as [[tobacco smoking|smoking]]. Maximum lifespan is also determined by the rate of [[aging]] for a species inherent in its [[gene]]s. Currently, the only widely recognized method of extending maximum lifespan is [[calorie restriction]]. Theoretically, extension of maximum lifespan can be achieved by reducing the rate of aging damage, by [[tissue engineering|periodic replacement of damaged tissues]], or by [[nanobiotechnology|molecular repair]] or [[rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]] of deteriorated cells and tissues.

A United States poll found that religious people and irreligious people, as well as men and women and people of different economic classes have similar rates of support for life extension, while Africans and Hispanics have higher rates of support than white people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2013/08/06/living-to-120-and-beyond-americans-views-on-aging-medical-advances-and-radical-life-extension/ |title=Living to 120 and Beyond: Americans' Views on Aging, Medical Advances and Radical Life Extension |date=6 August 2013 |publisher=Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project |website=Pew Research Center |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130816050024/http://www.pewforum.org/2013/08/06/living-to-120-and-beyond-americans-views-on-aging-medical-advances-and-radical-life-extension/ |archivedate=16 August 2013 |accessdate=19 September 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; 38 percent of the polled said they would desire to have their aging process cured.

Researchers of life extension are a subclass of biogerontologists known as "biomedical [[gerontologist]]s". They try to understand the nature of aging and they develop treatments to reverse aging processes or to at least slow them down, for the improvement of health and the maintenance of youthful vigor at every stage of life. Those who take advantage of life extension findings and seek to apply them upon themselves are called "life extensionists" or "longevists". The primary life extension strategy currently is to apply available anti-aging methods in the hope of living long enough to benefit from a complete cure to aging once it is developed.

== Reperfusion ==
"One of medicine's new frontiers: treating the dead", recognizes that cells that have been without oxygen for more than five minutes die,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=How We Die: Reflections on Life's Final Chapter |date=1993 |isbn=978-1-4176-4352-3 |publisher=Turtleback Books |author=[[Sherwin Nuland|Nuland, Sherwin B.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; not from lack of oxygen, but rather when their oxygen supply is resumed.

In society, the nature of death and humanity's [[Mortality salience|awareness of its own mortality]] has for millennia been a concern of the world's [[religious traditions]] and of [[philosophy|philosophical inquiry]]. This includes belief in [[resurrection]] or an [[afterlife]] (associated with [[Abrahamic religions]]), [[reincarnation]] or rebirth (associated with [[Dharmic religions]]), or that consciousness permanently ceases to exist, known as [[eternal oblivion]] (associated with [[atheism]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fuKB8MPMdG4C&amp;pg=PA18 |title=Handbook to the Afterlife |last1=Heath |first1=Pamela Rae |last2=Klimo |first2=Jon |publisher=North Atlantic Books |year=2010 |page=18 |isbn=978-1-55643-869-1 |accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commemoration ceremonies after death may include various [[mourning]], [[funeral]] practices and ceremonies of honouring the deceased. The physical remains of a person, commonly known as a ''corpse'' or ''body'', are usually [[burial|interred]] whole or [[cremated]], though among the world's cultures there are a variety of other methods of [[Disposal of human corpses|mortuary disposal]]. In the English language, blessings directed towards a dead person include ''[[rest in peace]]'', or its [[initialism]] RIP.

Death is the center of many traditions and organizations; customs relating to death are a feature of every culture around the world. Much of this revolves around the care of the dead, as well as the [[afterlife]] and the disposal of bodies upon the onset of death. The [[disposal of human corpses]] does, in general, begin with the [[last offices]] before significant time has passed, and ritualistic ceremonies often occur, most commonly interment or [[cremation]]. This is not a unified practice; in [[Tibet]], for instance, the body is given a [[sky burial]] and left on a mountain top. Proper preparation for death and techniques and ceremonies for producing the ability to transfer one's spiritual attainments into another body ([[reincarnation]]) are subjects of detailed study in Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mullin|1999|p=}}{{page needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mummification]] or [[embalming]] is also prevalent in some cultures, to retard the rate of [[Decomposition|decay]].

Legal aspects of death are also part of many cultures, particularly the settlement of the deceased [[estate (law)|estate]] and the issues of [[inheritance]] and in some countries, [[inheritance tax]]ation.

[[File:Grave stone2.JPG|thumb|left|upright|alt=Gravestones in Japan|Gravestones in [[Kyoto]], Japan]]
[[Capital punishment]] is also a culturally divisive aspect of death. In most jurisdictions where capital punishment is carried out today, the death penalty is reserved for premeditated [[murder]], [[espionage]], [[treason]], or as part of [[military justice]]. In some countries, sexual crimes, such as [[adultery]] and [[sodomy]], carry the death penalty, as do religious crimes such as [[apostasy]], the formal renunciation of one's religion. In many [[Use of capital punishment by nation|retentionist]] countries, [[drug trafficking]] is also a capital offense. In China, [[Trafficking in human beings|human trafficking]] and serious cases of [[political corruption|corruption]] are also punished by the death penalty. In militaries around the world [[courts-martial]] have imposed death sentences for offenses such as [[cowardice]], [[desertion]], [[insubordination]], and [[mutiny]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shotatdawn.org.uk/ |title=Shot at Dawn, campaign for pardons for British and Commonwealth soldiers executed in World War I |publisher=Shot at Dawn Pardons Campaign |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004030535/http://www.shotatdawn.org.uk/ |archivedate=4 October 2006 |accessdate=20 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Death in warfare and in [[suicide attack]] also have cultural links, and the ideas of [[dulce et decorum est pro patria mori]], [[mutiny]] punishable by death, grieving relatives of dead soldiers and [[death notification]] are embedded in many cultures. Recently in the western world, with the increase in terrorism following the [[September 11 attacks]], but also further back in time with suicide bombings, [[kamikaze]] missions in [[World War II]] and suicide missions in a host of other conflicts in history, death for a cause by way of suicide attack, and [[martyrdom]] have had significant cultural impacts.

[[Suicide]] in general, and particularly [[euthanasia]], are also points of cultural debate. Both acts are understood very differently in different cultures. In [[Japan]], for example, ending a life with honor by [[seppuku]] was considered a desirable death, whereas according to traditional Christian and Islamic cultures, suicide is viewed as a sin. [[Death (personification)|Death is personified]] in many cultures, with such symbolic representations as the [[Grim Reaper]], [[Azrael]], the [[Hindu]] God [[Yama]] and [[Father Time]].

In [[Brazil]], a human death is counted officially when it is registered by existing family members at a cartório, a government-authorized registry.  Before being able to file for an official death, the deceased must have been registered for an official birth at the cartório.  Though a Public Registry Law guarantees all Brazilian citizens the right to register deaths, regardless of their financial means, of their family members (often children), the Brazilian government has not taken away the burden, the hidden costs and fees, of filing for a death. For many impoverished families, the indirect costs and burden of filing for a death lead to a more appealing, unofficial, local, cultural burial, which in turn raises the debate about inaccurate [[mortality rates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nations |first=Marilyn K. |last2=Amaral |first2=Mara Lucia |title=Flesh, Blood, Souls, and Households: Cultural Validity in Mortality Inquiry |journal=Medical Anthropology Quarterly |date=September 1999 |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=204–220 |doi=10.1525/maq.1991.5.3.02a00020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Talking about death and witnessing it is a difficult issue with most cultures. Western societies may like to treat the dead with the utmost material respect, with an official embalmer and associated rites. Eastern societies (like India) may be more open to accepting it as a ''fait accompli'', with a funeral procession of the dead body ending in an open air burning-to-ashes of the same.

== Consciousness ==
{{Main|Consciousness after death}}

Much interest and debate surround the question of what happens to one's consciousness as one's body dies. The belief in the permanent loss of consciousness after death is often called ''[[eternal oblivion]]''. Belief that the [[Stream of consciousness (psychology)|stream of consciousness]] is preserved after physical death is described by the term ''[[afterlife]]''.

== In biology ==
[[File:Earthworm.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Earthworm]]s are a good example of soil-dwelling detritivores.]]
After death the remains of an organism become part of the [[biogeochemical cycle]]. Animals may be [[necrophagy|consumed]] by a [[predator]] or a [[scavenger]]. [[Organic material]] may then be further decomposed by [[detritivore]]s, organisms which recycle [[detritus]], returning it to the environment for reuse in the [[food chain]], where these chemicals may eventually end up being consumed and assimilated into the cells of a living organism. Examples of detritivores include [[earthworm]]s, [[woodlice]] and [[dung beetle]]s.

[[Microorganism]]s also play a vital role, raising the temperature of the decomposing matter as they break it down into yet simpler molecules. Not all materials need to be decomposed fully. [[Coal]], a [[fossil fuel]] formed over vast tracts of time in [[swamp]] ecosystems, is one example.

=== Natural selection ===
{{Main|Competition (biology)|Natural selection|Extinction}}

Contemporary [[history of evolutionary thought|evolutionary theory]] sees death as an important part of the process of [[natural selection]]. It is considered that organisms less [[adaptation|adapted]] to their environment are more likely to die having produced fewer offspring, thereby reducing their contribution to the [[gene pool]]. Their genes are thus eventually bred out of a population, leading at worst to [[extinction]] and, more positively, making the process possible, referred to as [[speciation]]. Frequency of [[biological reproduction|reproduction]] plays an equally important role in determining species survival: an organism that dies young but leaves numerous offspring displays, according to [[Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] criteria, much greater [[Darwinian fitness|fitness]] than a long-lived organism leaving only one.

=== Extinction ===
{{Main|Extinction}}
[[File:ExtinctDodoBird.jpeg|thumb|upright|alt=Painting of a dodo|A [[dodo]], the bird that became a [[byword (saying)|byword]] in the English language for the extinction of a species&lt;ref name="Diamond"&gt;{{cite book|last=Diamond |first=Jared M. |authorlink=Jared Diamond |title=Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies |edition=illustrated, reprint |publisher=[[W.W. Norton]] |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-393-31755-8 |pages=43–44 |chapter=Up to the Starting Line|title-link=Guns, Germs, and Steel }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Extinction is the cessation of existence of a species or group of [[Taxon|taxa]], reducing [[biodiversity]]. The moment of extinction is generally considered to be the death of the last individual of that species (although the [[population bottleneck|capacity to breed and recover]] may have been lost before this point). Because a species' potential [[range (biology)|range]] may be very large, determining this moment is difficult, and is usually done retrospectively. This difficulty leads to phenomena such as [[Lazarus taxon|Lazarus taxa]], where species presumed extinct abruptly "reappear" (typically in the [[fossil]] record) after a period of apparent absence. New species arise through the process of [[speciation]], an aspect of [[evolution]]. New varieties of organisms arise and thrive when they are able to find and exploit an [[ecological niche]] – and species become extinct when they are no longer able to survive in changing conditions or against superior competition.

=== Evolution of aging and mortality ===
{{Main|Evolution of aging}}

Inquiry into the evolution of aging aims to explain why so many living things and the vast majority of animals weaken and die with age (exceptions include ''[[Hydra (genus)|Hydra]]'' and the already cited jellyfish ''[[Turritopsis dohrnii]]'', which research shows to be [[biological immortality|biologically immortal]]). The evolutionary origin of [[senescence]] remains one of the fundamental puzzles of biology. [[Gerontology]] specializes in the science of human aging processes.

Organisms showing only [[asexual reproduction]] (e.g. [[bacteria]], some [[protist]]s, like the [[euglenoid]]s and many [[amoebozoan]]s) and [[unicellular]] organisms with [[sexual reproduction]] ([[Colony (biology)|colonial]] or not, like the [[Volvocales|volvocine]] algae ''[[Pandorina]]'' and ''[[Chlamydomonas]]'') are "immortal" at some extent, dying only due to external hazards, like being eaten or meeting with a fatal accident. In [[multicellular]] organisms (and also in [[multinucleate]] [[ciliates]]),&lt;ref&gt;Beukeboom, L. &amp; Perrin, N. (2014). ''The Evolution of Sex Determination''. Online Chapter 2: [http://global.oup.com/booksites/content/9780199657148/ The diversity of sexual cycles], p. 12. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; with a [[Weismann barrier|Weismannist development]], that is, with a division of labor between mortal [[somatic cells|somatic (body) cells]] and "immortal" [[germ cell|germ (reproductive) cells]], death becomes an essential part of life, at least for the somatic line.&lt;ref name=Gilbert&gt;{{cite book|last=Gilbert |first=S.F. |year=2003 |title=Developmental biology |edition=7th |place=Sunderland, Mass |publisher=Sinauer Associates |pages=34–35 |isbn=978-0-87893-258-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Volvox]]'' algae are among the simplest organisms to exhibit that division of labor between two completely different cell types, and as a consequence include death of somatic line as a regular, genetically regulated part of its [[Biological life cycle|life history]].&lt;ref name=Gilbert /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s00497-010-0158-4 |pmid=21174128 |pmc=3098969 |title=Evolution of reproductive development in the volvocine algae |last=Hallmann |first=A. |journal=Sexual Plant Reproduction |date=June 2011 |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=97–112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious views ==
Death is an important subject of religious doctrine.

=== Buddhism ===
{{See also|Anussati#The ten recollections}}

In Buddhist doctrine and practice, death plays an important role. Awareness of death was what motivated [[Gautama Buddha|Prince Siddhartha]] to strive to find the [[amrta#Theravada Buddhism|"deathless"]] and finally to attain [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]]. In Buddhist doctrine, death functions as a reminder of the value of [[Human beings in Buddhism|having been born as a human being]]. Being reborn as a human being is considered the only state in which one can attain  enlightenment, therefore death helps remind oneself that one should not that for granted. The belief in rebirth among Buddhists does not necessarily remove [[existential angst|death anxiety]], since all existence in the [[samsara (Buddhism)|cycle of rebirth]] is considered filled with [[dukkha|suffering]], and being reborn many times does not necessarily mean that one progresses.&lt;ref name="Blum 2004"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/Encyclopedia%20of%20Buddhism_2%20Vols_%20Buswell.pdf|last=Blum|first=Mark L.|editor1-last=Buswell|editor1-first=Robert E.|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Buddhism|volume=1|title=Death|date=2004|publisher=Macmillan Reference, [[Thomson Gale]]|location=New York |isbn=978-0-02-865720-2|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Death is part of several key Buddhist tenets, such as the [[Four Noble Truths]] and [[Pratītyasamutpāda|dependent origination]].&lt;ref name="Blum 2004" /&gt;

=== Judaism ===
[[File:Yahrtzeit candle.JPG|thumb|A [[yahrtzeit candle]] lit in memory of a loved one on the anniversary of the death]]
{{see also|Bereavement in Judaism}}
Death is seen in Judaism as tragic and intimidating.  Persons who come into contact with corpses are [[Tumah and taharah|ritually impure]].  There are a [[Jewish eschatology#The world to come|variety of beliefs about the afterlife]] within Judaism, but none of them contradict the preference of life over death.  This is partially because death puts a cessation to the possibility of fulfilling any [[Mitzvah|commandments]].&lt;ref&gt;Soloveitchik, Joseph B.  ''Halakhic Man.'' Qtd. in [https://elmad.pardes.org/2018/04/tazria-metzora-understanding-purity/ Israel]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{For|the 1843 short story|Egotism; or, The Bosom-Serpent}}
{{Other uses|Egoist (disambiguation)}}
{{refimprove|date=January 2016}}
'''Egotism''' is the drive to maintain and enhance favorable views of oneself, and generally features an inflated opinion of one's personal features and importance. It often includes intellectual, physical, social and other overestimations.&lt;ref&gt;Robin M. Kowalski ed., ''Aversive Interpersonal Behaviors'' (1997) p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;

The egotist has an overwhelming sense of the centrality of the 'Me', that is to say of their personal qualities.&lt;ref&gt;William Walker Atkinson, ''The New Psychology'' (2010 [1909]) p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Egotism means placing oneself at the core of one's world with no concern for others, including those "loved" or considered as "close", in any other terms except those subjectively set by the egotist.{{cn|date=January 2016}}

==Characteristics==
Egotism is closely related to an egocentric love for one's imagined self or [[narcissism]] – indeed some would say "by egotism we may envisage a kind of socialized narcissism".&lt;ref&gt;Samuel D. Schmalhausen, ''Why We Misbehave'' (2004 [1928]) p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; Egotists have a strong tendency to talk about themselves  in a self-promoting fashion, and they may well be arrogant and boastful with a [[grandiose]] sense of their own importance.&lt;ref&gt;Kowalski ed., p. 1114&lt;/ref&gt; Their inability to recognise the accomplishments of others&lt;ref&gt;Mark R. Leary, ''The Curse of the Self'' (OUP 2007) p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; leaves them profoundly self-promoting; while sensitivity to criticism may lead on the egotist's part to [[narcissistic rage]] at a sense of insult.&lt;ref&gt;Kowalski ed., p. 121-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Egotism differs from both [[altruism]] – or acting to gain ''fewer'' values than are being given – and from [[egoism]], the constant pursuit of one's self-interest. Various forms of "empirical egoism" have been considered consistent with egotism, but do not – which is also the case with egotism in general –  necessitate having an inflated sense of self.&lt;ref&gt;Kowalski ed., p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
In developmental terms, two rather different trajectories can be distinguished with respect to egotism – the one individual, the other cultural.

With respect to the developing individual, a movement takes place from egocentricity to sociality during the process of growing up.&lt;ref&gt;[[J. C. Flügel]], ''Man, Morals and Society'' (1973) p. 242–3&lt;/ref&gt; It is normal for an infant to have an inflated – almost a majestic – sense of egotism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sigmund Freud]], ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;  The over-evaluation of one's own ego&lt;ref&gt;[[Otto Fenichel]], ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 38 and p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; regularly appears in childish forms of love – in large part because the baby is to himself everything, [[Omnipotence|omnipotent]] to the best of their own  knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robin Skynner]] and [[John Cleese]], ''Families and how to survive them'' (London 1994) p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

Optimal development allows a gradual reconciliation to a more realistic view of one's own place in the world – a lessening of the egotistical swollen head.&lt;ref&gt;Skynner &amp; Cleese, ''Families'' p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; Less adequate adjustment may later lead to what has been called defensive egotism, serving to overcompensate for the fragility of the underlying concept of self.&lt;ref&gt;Kowalski ed., p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robin Skynner]] however considered that in the main growing up leads to a state where "your ego is still there, but it's taking its proper limited place among all the other egos".&lt;ref&gt;Robin Skynner and John Cleese, ''Life and how to survive it'' (London 1994) p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;

However, alongside such a positive trajectory of diminishing ''individual'' egotism, a rather different arc of development can be noted in cultural terms, linked to what has been seen as the increasing infantilism of (post)modern society.&lt;ref&gt;R. Bly and M. Woodman, ''The Maiden King'' (1999) p. 85–8&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas in the nineteenth century egotism was still widely regarded as a traditional vice – for [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] egotism was a sort of diseased self-contemplation&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Cowley, ed., ''The Portable Hawthorne'' (Penguin 1977) p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; – [[Romanticism]] had already set in motion a countervailing current, what [[Richard Eldridge]] described as a kind of "cultural egotism, substituting the individual imagination for vanishing social tradition".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Eldridge, ''The Persistence of Romanticism'' (2001) p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; The romantic idea of the self-creating individual – of a self-authorizing, artistic egotism&lt;ref&gt;Scott Wilson, in Patricia Waugh, ed., ''Literary Theory and Criticism'' (2006) p. 563–4&lt;/ref&gt; – then took on broader social dimensions in the following century. [[Keats]] might still attack [[Wordsworth]] for the regressive nature of his retreat into the egotistical sublime;&lt;ref&gt;Henry Hart, ''Robert Lowell and the Sublime'' (1995) p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; but by the close of the twentieth century egotism had been naturalized much more widely by the [[Me generation]] into the [[Culture of Narcissism]].

In the 21st century, romantic egotism has been seen as feeding into techno-capitalism in two complementary ways:&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 565-6&lt;/ref&gt; on the one hand, through the self-centred consumer, focused on their own self-fashioning through brand 'identity'; on the other through the equally egotistical voices of 'authentic' protest,  as they rage against the machine, only to produce new commodity forms that serve to fuel the system for further consumption.

==Sex==
There is a question mark over the relationship between sex and egotism. [[Sigmund Freud]] popularly made the claim that love can transform the egotist,&lt;ref&gt;Schmalhausen, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; giving him or her a new sense of  humility in relation to others.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, it is very apparent that egotism can readily show itself in sexual ways&lt;ref&gt;Schmalhausen, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; and indeed arguably one's whole sexuality may function in the service of egotistical needs.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 516-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term egotism is derived from the Greek ("εγώ") and subsequently its Latinised ego (''[[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]]''), meaning "self" or "I," and ''[[-ism]]'', used to denote a system of belief. As such, the term shares early etymology with [[wikt:egoism|egoism]].

==Cultural examples==
* [[A. A. Milne]] has been praised for his clear-eyed vision of the ruthless, open, unashamed egotism of the young child.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Thwaite, ''A. A. Milne: His Life'' (2006) p. 123 and p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ryan Holiday]] described our cultural values as dependent on validation, entitled, and ruled by our emotions, a form of egotism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ego Is The Enemy|last=Holiday|first=Ryan|publisher=Penguin Random House|year=2016|isbn=9780698192157|location=New York|pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="59546">An '''epigenetic clock''' is a type of a [[Biomarkers of aging|molecular age estimation method]] based on [[DNA methylation]] levels. Pre-eminent examples for epigenetic clocks are '''[[Steve Horvath|Horvath]]'s clock''',&lt;ref name="Horvath2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Horvath2015erratum" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ScienceDaily"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt; which applies to all human tissues/cells, and '''Hannum's clock''',&lt;ref name="Hannum2013" /&gt; which applies to blood.

==History==
The strong effects of age on DNA methylation levels have been known since the late 1960s.&lt;ref name="Berdyshev1967"/&gt; A vast literature describes sets of [[CpG site|CpGs]] whose DNA methylation levels correlate with age, e.g.&lt;ref name="Rakyan2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Teschendorff2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Koch2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Horvath2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bell2012"/&gt; The first robust demonstration that DNA methylation levels in saliva could generate accurate age predictors was published by a [[UCLA]] team including [[Steve Horvath]] in 2011 (Bocklandt et al 2011).&lt;ref name="Bocklandt2011" /&gt; The labs of Trey Ideker and Kang Zhang at the [[University of California, San Diego]] published the Hannum epigenetic clock (Hannum 2013),&lt;ref name="Hannum2013" /&gt; which consisted of 71 markers that accurately estimate age based on blood methylation levels. 
The first multi-tissue epigenetic clock, Horvath's epigenetic clock, was developed by [[Steve Horvath]], a professor of [[human genetics]]  and of [[biostatistics]] at [[UCLA]] (Horvath 2013).&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ScienceDaily"/&gt; Horvath spent over 4 years collecting publicly available Illumina DNA methylation data and identifying suitable statistical methods.&lt;ref name="Biome2013"/&gt; The personal story behind the discovery was featured in Nature.&lt;ref name="Gibbs2014"/&gt; The age estimator was developed using 8,000 samples from 82 Illumina DNA methylation array datasets, encompassing 51 healthy tissues and cell types. The major innovation of Horvath's epigenetic clock lies in its wide applicability: the same set of 353 CpGs and the same prediction algorithm is used irrespective of the DNA source within the organism, i.e. it does not require any adjustments or offsets.&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt; This property allows one to compare the ages of different areas of the human body using the same aging clock.

==Relationship to a cause of biological aging==
It is not yet known what exactly is measured by DNA methylation age. Horvath hypothesized that DNA methylation age measures the cumulative effect of an epigenetic maintenance system but details are unknown. The fact that DNA methylation age of blood predicts all-cause mortality in later life &lt;ref name="Chen2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marioni2015mortality"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Christiansen2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Horvath2015centenarian"/&gt; strongly suggests that it relates to a process that causes aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2016|title=DNA methylation-based measures of biological age: meta-analysis predicting time to death|url=http://www.aging-us.com/article/101020|journal=Aging|volume=8|pages=1844–1865|doi=10.18632/aging.101020|pmc=5076441|pmid=27690265|via=|doi-access=Free|vauthors=Chen B, Marioni R, Colicino E, Peters M, Ward-Caviness C, Tsai P, Roetker N, Just A, Demerath E, Guan W|displayauthors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is unlikely that the 353 clock CpGs are special or play a direct causal role in the aging process.&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt; Rather, the epigenetic clock captures an [[Emergence|emergent property]] of the epigenome.

===Epigenetic clock theory of aging===
Horvath and Raj &lt;ref name="HorvathRaj2018"/&gt; proposed an epigenetic clock theory of aging with the following tenets:
* Biological aging results as an unintended consequence of both developmental programs and maintenance program, the molecular footprints of which give rise to DNA methylation age estimators. 
* The precise mechanisms linking the innate molecular processes (underlying DNAm age) to the decline in tissue function probably relate to both intracellular changes (leading to a loss of cellular identity) and subtle changes in cell composition, for example, fully functioning somatic stem cells. 
* At the molecular level, DNAm age is a proximal readout of a collection of innate aging processes that conspire with other, independent root causes of ageing to the detriment of tissue function.

==Motivation for biological clocks==
In general, biological aging clocks and [[biomarkers of aging]]  are expected to find many uses in biological research since age is a fundamental characteristic of most [[organisms]]. Accurate measures of biological age ('''biological aging clocks''') could be useful for
* testing the validity of various [[theories of biological aging]],
* diagnosing various age related [[disease]]s and for defining [[cancer]] subtypes,
* predicting/prognosticating  the onset of various diseases,
* serving as [[surrogate marker]]s for evaluating therapeutic interventions including  [[Rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]]  approaches,
* studying [[developmental biology]] and [[cell differentiation]],
* [[forensic]] applications, for example to estimate the age of a suspect based on blood left on a crime scene.
Overall, biological clocks are expected to be useful for studying what causes aging and what can be done against it.

==Properties of Horvath's clock==
The clock is defined as an age estimation method based on 353 [[epigenetics|epigenetic]] markers on the DNA. The 353 markers measure [[DNA methylation]] of [[CpG dinucleotide]]s. Estimated age ("predicted age" in mathematical usage), also referred to as DNA methylation age, has the following properties: first, it is close to zero for embryonic and [[induced pluripotent stem cell]]s; second, it correlates with cell [[Subculture (biology)#Passage number|passage number]]; third, it gives rise to a highly heritable measure of age acceleration; and, fourth, it is applicable to chimpanzee tissues (which are used as human analogs for biological testing purposes). Organismal growth (and concomitant cell division) leads to a high ticking rate of the epigenetic clock that slows down to a constant ticking rate (linear dependence) after adulthood (age 20).&lt;ref name="Horvath2013" /&gt;
The fact that DNA methylation age of blood predicts all-cause mortality in later life even after adjusting for known risk factors &lt;ref name="Chen2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marioni2015mortality"/&gt; suggests that it relates to a process that causes aging. Similarly, markers of physical and mental fitness are associated with the epigenetic clock (lower abilities associated with age acceleration).&lt;ref name="Marioni2015fitness"/&gt;

Salient features of Horvath's epigenetic clock include its high accuracy and its applicability to a broad spectrum of tissues and cell types. Since it allows one to contrast the ages of different tissues from the same subject, it can be used to identify tissues that show evidence of accelerated age due to disease.

===Statistical approach===
The basic approach is to form a weighted average of the 353 clock CpGs, which is then transformed to DNAm age using a calibration function. The calibration function reveals that the epigenetic clock has a high ticking rate until adulthood, after which it slows to a constant ticking rate. Using the training data sets, Horvath used a penalized regression model ([[Elastic net regularization]]) to regress a calibrated version of chronological age on 21,369 CpG probes that were present both on the Illumina 450K and 27K platform and had fewer than 10 missing values. DNAm age is defined as estimated ("predicted") age. The elastic net predictor automatically selected 353 CpGs. 193 of the 353 CpGs correlate positively with age while the remaining 160 CpGs correlate negatively with age. R software and a freely available web-based tool can be found  at the following webpage.&lt;ref name="DNAmAgeSoftware"/&gt;

===Accuracy===
The median error of estimated age is 3.6 years across a wide spectrum of tissues and cell types
.&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt;  The epigenetic clock performs well in heterogeneous tissues (for example, whole blood, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, cerebellar samples, occipital cortex, buccal epithelium, colon, adipose, kidney, liver, lung, saliva, uterine cervix, epidermis, muscle) as well as in individual cell types such as CD4 T cells, CD14 monocytes, glial cells, neurons, immortalized B cells, mesenchymal stromal cells.&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt; However, accuracy depends to some extent on the source of the DNA.

=== Comparison with other biological clocks ===
{{Synthesis|section|date=December 2016}}
The epigenetic clock leads to a chronological age prediction that has a [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|Pearson correlation coefficient]] of r=0.96 with chronological age (Figure 2 in &lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt;). Thus the age correlation is close to its maximum possible correlation value of 1.  Other biological clocks are based on a) [[telomere]] length, b) [[P16 (gene)|p16INK4a]] expression levels (also known as INK4a/ARF locus),&lt;ref name="Collado2007"/&gt; and c) [[microsatellite]] mutations.&lt;ref name="Forster2015"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Forster | first1 = P | last2 = Hohoff | first2 = C | last3 = Dunkelmann | first3 = B | last4 = Schürenkamp | first4 = M | last5 = Pfeiffer | first5 = H | last6 = Neuhuber | first6 = F | last7 = Brinkmann | first7 = B | year = 2015 | title = Elevated germline mutation rate in teenage fathers | url = http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/282/1803/20142898.long | journal = Proc Biol Sci | volume = 282 | issue = | page = 20142898 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2014.2898 | pmid=25694621 | pmc=4345458}}&lt;/ref&gt; The correlation between chronological age and [[telomere]] length is r=−0.51 in women and r=−0.55 in men.&lt;ref name="Nordfjall2010"/&gt; The correlation between chronological age and expression levels of [[P16 (gene)|p16INK4a]] in T cells is r=0.56.&lt;ref name="Wang2012"/&gt; {{citation needed span|text=[[P16 (gene)|p16INK4a]] expression levels only relate to age in [[T cell]]s, a type of white blood cells.|date=December 2016}} {{citation needed span|text=The microsatellite clock measures not chronological age but age in terms of elapsed cell divisions within a tissue.|date=December 2016}}

==Applications of Horvath's clock==
By contrasting DNA methylation age (estimated age) with chronological age, one can define measures of age acceleration. Age acceleration can be defined as the difference between DNA methylation age and chronological age. Alternatively, it can be defined as the residual that results from regressing DNAm age on chronological age. The latter measure is attractive because it does not correlate with chronological age.
A positive/negative value of epigenetic age acceleration suggests that the underlying tissue ages faster/slower than expected.

===Genetic studies of epigenetic age acceleration===
The broad sense heritability (defined via [[Falconer's formula]]) of age acceleration of blood from older subjects is around 40% but it appears to be much higher in newborns.&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt;
Similarly, the age acceleration of brain tissue (prefrontal cortex) was found to be 41% in older subjects.&lt;ref name="Levine2015"/&gt;
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of epigenetic age acceleration in postmortem brain samples have identified
several [[Single nucleotide polymorphism|SNPs]] at a genomewide significance level.&lt;ref name="Lu2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lu2017"/&gt;
GWAS of age acceleration in blood have identified several genome-wide significant genetic loci including the telomerase reverse transcriptase gene ([[Telomerase reverse transcriptase|TERT]]) locus
.&lt;ref name="LuGWAS2018"&gt;Lu AT., &amp; Xue L., &amp; Chen BH., et al., Horvath S. (2018). [

GWAS of epigenetic aging rates in blood reveals a critical role for TERT]. Nat Comm{{ doi|10.1038/s41467-017-02697-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Genetic variants associated with longer leukocyte telomere length in TERT gene paradoxically confer higher epigenetic age acceleration in blood.&lt;ref name="LuGWAS2018"/&gt;

===Lifestyle factors===
In general, lifestyle factors have only weak effects on epigenetic age acceleration in blood.&lt;ref name="Quach2017"&gt;Quach A., &amp; Levine ME., &amp; Tanaka T.,…., &amp; Horvath S. (2018). [

Epigenetic clock analysis of diet, exercise, education, and lifestyle factors.]. Aging (Albany NY){{ doi|
10.18632/aging.101168}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, cross sectional studies of extrinsic epigenetic aging rates in blood confirm the conventional wisdom regarding the benefits of education, eating a high plant diet with lean meats, moderate alcohol consumption, physical activity and the risks associated with [[Metabolic syndrome|metabolic syndrome]].

===Obesity and metabolic syndrome===
The epigenetic clock was used to study the relationship between high [[body mass index]] (BMI) and the DNA methylation ages of human blood, liver, muscle and adipose tissue.&lt;ref name="Horvath2014obesity"/&gt; A significant correlation (r=0.42) between BMI and epigenetic age acceleration could be observed for the liver. A much larger sample size (n=4200 blood samples) revealed a weak but statistically significant correlation (r=0.09) between BMI and intrinsic age acceleration of blood.&lt;ref name="Quach2017"/&gt; The same large study found that various biomarkers of [[metabolic syndrome]] (glucose-, insulin-, triglyceride levels, C-reactive protein, [[Waist–hip ratio|waist-to-hip ratio]]) were associated with epigenetic age acceleration in blood.&lt;ref name="Quach2017"/&gt; Conversely, high levels of the good cholesterol [[High-density lipoprotein|HDL]] were associated with a lower epigenetic aging rate of blood.&lt;ref name="Quach2017"/&gt;

===Female breast tissue is older than expected===
DNAm age is higher than chronological age in female breast tissue that is adjacent to breast cancer tissue.&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt; Since normal tissue which is adjacent to other cancer types does not exhibit a similar age acceleration effect, this finding suggests that normal female breast tissue ages faster than other parts of the body.&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt; Similarly, normal breast tissue samples from women without cancer have been found to be substantially older than blood samples collected from the same women at the same time {{PMID|28364215}}.

===Cancer tissue===
Cancer tissues show both positive and negative age acceleration effects. For most tumor types, no significant relationship can be observed between age acceleration and tumor morphology (grade/stage).&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Horvath2015erratum"/&gt; On average, cancer tissues with mutated [[P53|TP53]] have a lower age acceleration than those without it.&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt; Further, cancer tissues  with high age acceleration tend to have fewer somatic mutations than those with low age acceleration.&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Horvath2015erratum"/&gt;
Age acceleration is highly related to various genomic aberrations in cancer tissues. Somatic mutations in [[estrogen receptor]]s or [[progesterone receptor]]s are associated with accelerated DNAm age in breast cancer.&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt; Colorectal cancer samples with a [[BRAF (gene)|BRAF]] (V600E) mutation or promoter hypermethylation of the mismatch repair gene [[MLH1]] are associated with an increased age acceleration.&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt; Age acceleration in [[glioblastoma multiforme]] samples is highly significantly associated with certain mutations in [[H3F3A]].&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt;
One study suggests that the epigenetic age of blood tissue may be prognostic of lung cancer incidence.&lt;ref name="Levine2015lungcancer"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Levine | first1 = M  | date = 2015 | title = DNA methylation age of blood predicts future onset of lung cancer in the women's health initiative.| url = http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v7/n9/full/100809.html | journal = Aging | volume = 7| issue = | pages =690–700| pmid= 26411804 | pmc=4600626 | doi=10.18632/aging.100809}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome)===
[[Down syndrome|Down Syndrome (DS)]] entails an increased risk of many chronic diseases that are typically associated with older age. The clinical manifestations of accelerated aging suggest that trisomy 21 increases the biological age of tissues, but molecular evidence for this hypothesis has been sparse. According to the epigenetic clock, trisomy 21 significantly increases the age of blood and brain tissue (on average by 6.6 years).&lt;ref name="Horvath2015DownSyndrome"/&gt;

===Alzheimer's disease related neuropathology===
Epigenetic age acceleration of the human prefrontal cortex was found to be correlated with several neuropathological measurements that play a role in Alzheimer's disease &lt;ref name="Levine2015" /&gt;  Further, it was found to be associated with a decline in global cognitive functioning, and memory functioning among individuals with Alzheimer's disease.&lt;ref name="Levine2015" /&gt;
The epigenetic age of '''blood''' relates to cognitive functioning in the elderly.&lt;ref name="Marioni2015fitness"/&gt; Overall, these results strongly suggest that the epigenetic clock lends itself for measuring the biological age of the brain.

===Cerebellum ages slowly===
It has been difficult to identify tissues that seem to evade aging due to the lack of biomarkers of tissue age that allow one to contrast compare the ages of different tissues. An application of epigenetic clock to 30 anatomic sites from six centenarians and younger subjects revealed that the [[cerebellum]] ages slowly: it is about 15 years younger than expected in a centenarian.&lt;ref name="Horvath2015cerebellum"/&gt; This finding might explain why the cerebellum exhibits fewer neuropathological hallmarks of age related dementias compared to other brain regions. In younger subjects (e.g. younger than 70), brain regions and brain cells appear to have roughly the same age.&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Horvath2015cerebellum"/&gt; Several SNPs and genes have been identified that relate to the epigenetic age of the cerebellum &lt;ref name="Lu2016"/&gt;

===Huntington's disease===
[[Huntington's disease]] has been found to increase the epigenetic aging rates of several human brain regions.&lt;ref name="Horvath2016HD"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 =Horvath | first1 = S  | date = 2016 | title = Huntington's disease accelerates epigenetic aging of human brain and disrupts DNA methylation levels

===Centenarians age slowly===
The offspring of semi-supercentenarians (subjects who reached an age of 105–109 years) have a lower epigenetic age than age-matched controls (age difference=5.1 years in blood) and centenarians are younger (8.6 years) than expected based on their chronological age.&lt;ref name="Horvath2015centenarian"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Horvath | first1 = S  | date = 2015 | title = Decreased epigenetic age of PBMCs from Italian semi-supercentenarians and their offspring.| url =

===HIV infection===
Infection with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 ([[HIV]]) is associated with clinical symptoms of accelerated aging, as evidenced by increased incidence and diversity of age-related illnesses at relatively young ages. But it has been difficult to detect an accelerated aging effect on a molecular level. An epigenetic clock analysis of human DNA from HIV+ subjects and controls detected a significant age acceleration effect in brain (7.4 years) and blood (5.2 years) tissue due to HIV-1 infection.&lt;ref name="Horvath2015HIV"/&gt; These results are consistent with an independent study that also found an age advancement of 5 years in blood of HIV patients and a strong effect of the HLA locus.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gross|first=Andrew M.|last2=Jaeger|first2=Philipp A.|last3=Kreisberg|first3=Jason F.|last4=Licon|first4=Katherine|last5=Jepsen|first5=Kristen L.|last6=Khosroheidari|first6=Mahdieh|last7=Morsey|first7=Brenda M.|last8=Swindells|first8=Susan|last9=Shen|first9=Hui|date= 2016-04-21|title=Methylome-wide Analysis of Chronic HIV Infection Reveals Five-Year Increase in Biological Age and Epigenetic Targeting of HLA|journal=Molecular Cell|volume=62|issue=2|pages=157–168|doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2016.03.019|issn=1097-4164|pmc=4995115|pmid=27105112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parkinson's disease===
A large-scale study suggests that the blood of Parkinson's disease subjects exhibits (relatively weak) accelerated aging effects.&lt;ref name="Horvath2015"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Horvath | first1 = S | year = 2015 | title = Increased epigenetic age and granulocyte counts in the blood of Parkinson's disease patients.| url = http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v7/n12/full/100859.html| journal = Aging | volume=7| issue =| pages =  1130–42| doi = 10.18632/aging.100859| pmid= 26655927 | pmc=4712337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developmental disorder: syndrome X===
Children with a very rare disorder known as [[Brooke Greenberg|syndrome X]] maintain the façade of persistent toddler-like features while aging from birth to adulthood. Since the physical development of these children is dramatically delayed, these children appear to be a toddler or at best a preschooler. According to an epigenetic clock analysis, blood tissue from syndrome X cases is not younger than expected.&lt;ref name="Horvath2015syndromeX"/&gt;

===Menopause accelerates epigenetic aging===
The following results strongly suggest that the loss of female hormones resulting from menopause accelerates the epigenetic aging rate of blood and possibly that of other tissues.&lt;ref name="Levine2016menopause"/&gt; First, early [[menopause]] has been found to be associated with an increased epigenetic age acceleration of blood.&lt;ref name="Levine2016menopause"/&gt; Second, surgical menopause (due to bilateral
[[oophorectomy]]) is associated with epigenetic age acceleration in blood and saliva. Third, [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|menopausal hormone therapy]], which mitigates hormonal loss, is associated with a negative age acceleration of buccal cells (but not of blood cells).&lt;ref name="Levine2016menopause"/&gt; Fourth, genetic markers that are associated with early menopause are also associated with increased epigenetic age acceleration in blood.&lt;ref name="Levine2016menopause"/&gt;

===Cellular senescence versus epigenetic aging===
A confounding aspect of biological aging is the nature and role of senescent cells. It is unclear whether the three major types of cellular senescence, namely replicative senescence, oncogene-induced senescence and DNA damage-induced senescence are descriptions of the same phenomenon instigated by different sources, or if each of these is distinct, and how they are associated with epigenetic aging.
Induction of replicative senescence (RS) and oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) were found to be accompanied by epigenetic aging of primary cells but senescence induced by DNA damage was not, even though RS and OIS activate the cellular DNA damage response pathway.&lt;ref name="Lowe2016"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lowe | first1 =D | year = 2016 | title = Epigenetic clock analyses of cellular senescence and ageing. | url =

Consistent with this, telomerase-immortalised cells continued to age (according to the epigenetic clock) without having been treated with any senescence inducers or DNA-damaging agents, re-affirming the independence of the process of epigenetic ageing from telomeres, cellular senescence, and the DNA damage response pathway.
Although the uncoupling of senescence from cellular aging appears at first sight to be inconsistent with the fact that senescent cells contribute to the physical manifestation of organism ageing, as demonstrated by Baker et al., where removal of senescent cells slowed down aging.&lt;ref name="Baker2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baker | first1 =DJ | year = 2011 | title = Clearance of p16Ink4a-positive senescent cells delays ageing-associated disorders. | url =http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v479/n7372/full/nature10600.html
| journal = Nature | volume=479| issue =7372| pages = 232–6 | doi = 10.1038/nature10600| pmid= 22048312  | pmc=3468323}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the epigenetic clock analysis of senescence suggests that cellular senescence is a state that cells are forced into as a result of external pressures such as DNA damage, ectopic oncogene expression and exhaustive proliferation of cells to replenish those eliminated by external/environmental factors.&lt;ref name="Lowe2016"/&gt; These senescent cells, in sufficient numbers, will probably cause the deterioration of tissues, which is interpreted as organism ageing. However, at the cellular level, aging, as measured by the epigenetic clock, is distinct from senescence. It is an intrinsic mechanism that exists from the birth of the cell and continues. This implies that if cells are not shunted into senescence by the external pressures described above, they would still continue to age. This is consistent with the fact that mice with naturally long telomeres still age and eventually die even though their telomere lengths are far longer than the critical limit, and they age prematurely when their telomeres are forcibly shortened, due to replicative senescence. Therefore, cellular senescence is a route by which cells exit prematurely from the natural course of cellular aging.&lt;ref name="Lowe2016"/&gt;

===Effect of sex and race/ethnicity===
Men age faster than women according to epigenetic age acceleration in blood, brain, saliva, and many other tissues.
&lt;ref name="Horvath2016Race"&gt;{{Cite journal| title = An epigenetic clock analysis of race/ethnicity, sex, and coronary heart disease.| journal = [[Genome Biol]]| volume =17  | issue = 1| year = 2016| pmid = 27511193  |pmc= 4980791|vauthors= Horvath S, Gurven M, Levine ME, Trumble BC, Kaplan H, Allayee H, Ritz BR, Chen B, Lu AT, Rickabaugh TM, Jamieson BD, Sun D, Li S, Chen W, Quintana-Murci L, Fagny M, Kobor MS, Tsao PS, Reiner AP, Edlefsen KL, Absher D, Assimes TL | doi=10.1186/s13059-016-1030-0| pages=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The epignetic clock method applies to all examined racial/ethnic groups in the sense that DNAm age is highly correlated with chronological age. But ethnicity can be associated with epigenetic age acceleration.&lt;ref name="Horvath2016Race"/&gt; For example, the blood of Hispanics and the [[Tsimané people|Tsimané]] ages more slowly than that of other populations which might explain the [[Hispanic paradox|Hispanic mortality paradox]].&lt;ref name="Horvath2016Race"/&gt;

===Rejuvenation effect due to stem cell transplantation in blood===
[[Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation]], which transplants these cells from a young donor to an older recipient, rejuvenates the epigenetic age of blood to that of the donor {{PMID| 28550187}}. However, [[graft-versus-host disease]] is associated with increased DNA methyhlation age {{PMID| 28550187}}.

===Progeria===
Adult progeria also known as [[Werner syndrome]] is associated with epigenetic age acceleration in blood.&lt;ref name="Maierhofer2017Werner"/&gt;
Fibroblast samples from childen with Hutchinson-Gilford [[Progeria]] exhibit accelerated epigenetic aging effects according to the "skin &amp; blood" epigenetic clock but not according to the original pan tissue clock from Horvath.

==Biological mechanism behind the epigenetic clock==
Despite the fact that biomarkers of ageing based on DNA methylation data have enabled accurate age estimates for any tissue across the entire life course, the precise biological mechanism behind the epigenetic clock is currently unknown.&lt;ref name="HorvathRaj2018"&gt;Horvath, S., &amp; Raj, K. (2018). [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-018-0004-3  DNA methylation-based biomarkers and the epigenetic clock theory of ageing]. Nature Reviews Genetics, {{doi|10.1038/s41576-018-0004-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, epigenetic biomarkers may help to address long-standing questions in many fields, including the central question: why do we age?  The following explanations have been proposed in the literature.

===Possible explanation 1: Epigenomic maintenance system===
Horvath hypothesized that his clock arises from a methylation footprint left by an epigenomic maintenance system.&lt;ref name="Horvath2013" /&gt;

===Possible explanation 2: Unrepaired DNA damages===
{{Synthesis|section|date=December 2016}}
Endogenous DNA damages occur frequently including about 50 double-strand DNA breaks per cell cycle&lt;ref name="pmid14566050"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vilenchik MM, Knudson AG |title=Endogenous DNA double-strand breaks: production, fidelity of repair, and induction of cancer |journal=Proc.

Accumulation of epigenetic alterations may parallel the accumulation of un-repaired DNA damages that are proposed to cause aging (see [[DNA damage theory of aging]]).

==Other age estimators based on DNA methylation levels==
{{Synthesis|section|date=December 2016}}
Several other age estimators have been described in the literature.

1) Weidner et al. (2014) describe an age estimator for DNA from blood that uses only three CpG sites of genes hardly affected by aging (cg25809905 in integrin, alpha 2b (ITGA2B); cg02228185 in aspartoacylase (ASPA) and cg17861230 in phosphodiesterase 4C, cAMP specific (PDE4C)).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weidner | first1 = C. I. | last2 = Lin | first2 = Q. | last3 = Koch | first3 = C. M. | last4 = Eisele | first4 = L. | last5 = Beier | first5 = F. | last6 = Ziegler | first6 = P. | last7 = Wagner | first7 = W. | year = 2014 | title = Aging of blood can be tracked by DNA methylation changes at just three CpG sites | url = http://genomebiology.com/2014/15/2/R24 | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 15 | issue = 2| page = R24 | doi = 10.1186/gb-2014-15-2-r24 | pmid=24490752 | pmc=4053864}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The age estimator by Weidener et al. (2014) applies only to blood. Even in blood this sparse estimator is far less accurate than Horvath's epigenetic clock (Horvath 2014) when applied to data generated by the Illumina 27K or 450K platforms.

&lt;/ref&gt; But the sparse estimator was developed for pyrosequencing data and is highly cost effective.
&lt;ref&gt;Wagner W (2014) Response to comment "comparison with the epigenetic clock by Horvath 2013" [http://genomebiology.com/2014/15/2/R24/comments#1977698]
&lt;/ref&gt;

2) Hannum et al. (2013) &lt;ref name="Hannum2013"/&gt; report several age estimators: one for each tissue type. Each of these estimators requires covariate information (e.g. gender, body mass index, batch). The authors mention that each tissue led to a clear linear offset (intercept and slope). Therefore, the authors had to adjust the blood-based age estimator for each tissue type using a linear model. When the Hannum estimator is applied to other tissues, it leads to a high error (due to poor calibration) as can be seen from Figure 4A in Hannum et al. (2013). Hannum et al. adjusted their blood-based age estimator (by adjusting the slope and the intercept term) in order to apply it to other tissue types. Since this adjustment step removes differences between tissue, the blood-based estimator from Hannum et al. cannot be used to compare the ages of different tissues/organs. In contrast, a salient characteristic of the epigenetic clock  is that one does not have to carry out such a calibration step:&lt;ref name="Horvath2013"/&gt; it always uses the same CpGs and the same coefficient values. Therefore, Horvath's epigenetic clock can be used to compare the ages of different tissues/cells/organs from the same individual. While the age estimators from Hannum et al. cannot be used to compare the ages of different normal tissues, they can be used to compare the age of a cancerous tissue with that of a corresponding normal (non-cancerous) tissue. Hannum et al. reported pronounced age acceleration effects in all cancers. In contrast, Horvath's epigenetic clock &lt;ref name="Horvath2015erratum"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://genomebiology.com/2013/14/10/R115/comments Horvath S (2013-11-04 11:00) Erratum in cancer tissues  Reader Comment]
&lt;/ref&gt; reveals that some cancer types (e.g. triple negative breast cancers or uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma) exhibit negative age acceleration, i.e. cancer tissue can be much younger than expected.
An important difference relates to additional covariates. Hannum's age estimators make use of covariates such as gender, body mass index, diabetes status, ethnicity, and batch. Since new data involve different batches, one cannot apply it directly to new data. However, the authors present coefficient values for their CpGs in Supplementary Tables which can be used to define an aggregate measure that tends to be strongly correlated with chronological age but may be poorly calibrated (i.e. lead to high errors).

These results were generated in an independent blood methylation data set that was not used in the construction of these predictors (data generated in Nov 2014).]]

3.) Giuliani et al. identify genomic regions whose DNA methylation level correlates with age in human teeth. They propose the evaluation of DNA methylation at ELOVL2, FHL2, and PENK genes in DNA recovered from both cementum and pulp of the same modern teeth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Giuliani | first1 = C. | last2 = Cilli | first2 = E. | last3 = Bacalini | first3 = M.

In a multicenter benchmarking study 18 research groups from three continents compared all promising methods for analyzing DNA methylation in the clinic and identified the most accurate methods, having concluded that epigenetic tests based on DNA methylation are a mature technology ready for broad clinical use.&lt;ref&gt;Christoph Bock et al.

They found that mice treated with lifespan-extending interventions (surch as calorie restriction or dietary rapamycin) were significantly younger in epigenetic age than their untreated, wild-type age-matched controls. Mice age predictors also detects the longevity effects of gene knockouts, and rejuvenation of fibroblast-derived iPSCs.

Mice multi-tissue age predictor based on DNA methylation at 329 unique CpG sites reached a median absolute error of less than 4 weeks (~5% of lifespan). 
An attempt to use the human clock sites in mouse for age predictions showed that human clock  is not fully conserved in mouse.&lt;ref&gt;Stubbs, T. M., Bonder, M. J., Stark, A.

'''Ethical egoism'''  is the [[normative ethics|normative ethical]] position that [[Moral agency|moral agent]]s ought to do what is in their own [[self-interest]]. It differs from [[psychological egoism]], which claims that [[people]] can only act in their self-interest. Ethical egoism also differs from [[rational egoism]], which holds that it is [[rationality|rational]] to act in one's self-interest.&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, Steven M. "Is egoism morally defensible?" ''Philosophia''. Springer Netherlands. Volume 18, Numbers 2–3 / July 1988&lt;/ref&gt;
Ethical egoism holds, therefore, that actions whose consequences will benefit the doer can be considered ethical in this sense.

Ethical egoism contrasts with ethical [[altruism (ethics)|altruism]], which holds that moral agents have an [[moral obligation|obligation]] to help others. Egoism and altruism both contrast with ethical [[utilitarianism]], which holds that a moral agent should treat one's [[Philosophy of self|self]] (also known as [[subject (philosophy)|the subject]]) with no higher regard than one has for others (as egoism does, by elevating self-interests and "the self" to a status not granted to others). But it also holds that one should not (as altruism does) sacrifice one's own interests to help others' interests, so long as one's own interests (i.e. one's own [[desire (philosophy)|desires]] or [[Quality of life|well-being]]) are substantially equivalent to the others' interests and well-being. Egoism, utilitarianism, and altruism are all forms of [[consequentialism]], but egoism and altruism contrast with utilitarianism, in that egoism and altruism are both [[Consequentialism#Agent-focused or agent-neutral|agent-focused]] forms of consequentialism (i.e. subject-focused or [[Subjectivity|subjective]]). However, utilitarianism is held to be agent-neutral (i.e. [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] and [[Impartiality|impartial]]): it does not treat the subject's (i.e. the self's, i.e. the moral "agent's") own interests as being more or less important than the interests, desires, or well-being of others.

Ethical egoism does not, however, require moral agents to harm the interests and well-being of others when making moral deliberation; e.g. what is in an agent's self-interest may be incidentally detrimental, beneficial, or neutral in its effect on others. [[Individualism]] allows for others' interest and well-being to be disregarded or not, as long as what is chosen is efficacious in satisfying the self-interest of the agent. Nor does ethical egoism necessarily entail that, in pursuing self-interest, one ought always to do what one wants to do; e.g. in the long term, the fulfillment of short-term desires may prove detrimental to [[self (philosophy)|the self]]. Fleeting pleasure, then, takes a back seat to protracted [[eudaimonia]]. In the words of [[James Rachels]], "Ethical egoism ... endorses selfishness, but it doesn't endorse foolishness."&lt;ref name="Rachels 2008, p. 534"&gt;Rachels 2008, p. 534.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethical egoism is often used as the philosophical basis for support of [[right-libertarianism]] and [[individualist anarchism]].&lt;ref name=ridgely&gt;{{Cite web

==Forms==
Ethical egoism can be broadly divided into three categories: individual, personal, and universal. An ''individual ethical egoist'' would hold that all people should do whatever benefits "my" (''the individual'')'' ''self-interest; a ''personal ethical egoist'' would hold that he or she should act in ''his or her'' self-interest, but would make no claims about what anyone else ought to do; a ''universal ethical egoist'' would argue that everyone should act in ways that are in their self-interest.&lt;ref&gt;Waller (2005), p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Waller (2005), p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Ethical egoism was introduced by the philosopher [[Henry Sidgwick]] in his book ''[[The Methods of Ethics]]'', written in 1874. Sidgwick compared egoism to the philosophy of [[utilitarianism]], writing that whereas utilitarianism sought to maximize overall pleasure, egoism focused only on maximizing individual pleasure.&lt;ref name="routledge"&gt;{{Cite book| title = Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy | chapter = Egoism and Altruism | last = Floridi | first = Luciano | last2 = Craig | first2 = Edward |publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis | isbn = 9780415187091|pages=246–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophers before Sidgwick have also retroactively been identified as ethical egoists. One ancient example is the philosophy of [[Yang Zhu]] (4th century BC), [[Yangism]], who views ''wei wo'', or "everything for myself", as the only virtue necessary for self-cultivation.&lt;ref name="senghaas"&gt;{{Cite book| title = The clash within civilizations: coming to terms with cultural conflicts | year =2002 | last =Senghaas | first =Dieter |publisher = [[Psychology Press]] | isbn =  978-0-415-26228-6|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Greek philosophers like Plato, Aristotle and the Stoics were exponents of [[virtue ethics]], and "did not accept the formal principle that whatever the good is, we should seek only our own good, or prefer it to the good of others."&lt;ref name="routledge"/&gt; However, the beliefs of the [[Cyrenaics]] have been referred to as a "form of egoistic hedonism",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/cyren/ Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Cyrenaics]&lt;/ref&gt; and while some refer to Epicurus' hedonism as a form of [[virtue ethics]], others argue his ethics are more properly described as ethical egoism.&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Evans | first = Matthew | title = Can Epicureans be friends? | journal = Ancient Philosophy | volume = 24 | pages = 407–24 | date = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Justifications==
Philosopher [[James Rachels]], in an essay that takes as its title the theory's name, outlines the three arguments most commonly touted in its favor:&lt;ref&gt;He notes, however, that "the theory is asserted more often than it is argued for. Many of its supporters apparently think its truth is self-evident, so that arguments are not needed." (Rachels 2008, p. 534.)&lt;/ref&gt;

*"The first argument," writes Rachels, "has several variations, each suggesting the same general point:&lt;ref&gt;That is, that regarding and pursuing the interests of others is a self-defeating policy. Rachels quotes Alexander Pope in support of this: "Thus God and nature formed the general frame/And bade self-love and social be the same."&lt;/ref&gt;
**"Each of us is intimately familiar with our own individual wants and needs. Moreover, each of us is uniquely placed to pursue those wants and needs effectively. At the same time, we know the desires and needs of others only imperfectly, and we are not well situated to pursue them. Therefore, it is reasonable to believe that if we set out to be 'our brother's keeper,' we would often bungle the job and end up doing more mischief than good."&lt;ref name="Rachels 2008, p. 534"/&gt;
**To give charity to someone is to degrade him, implying as it does that he is reliant on such munificence and quite unable to look out for himself. "That," reckons Rachels, "is why the recipients of 'charity' are so often resentful rather than appreciative."&lt;ref&gt;Rachels 2008, p. 534, where it is pointed out that, in the strictest egoistic terms, this is an inconsequential argument. Ethical egoism does not bother itself with how others receive charity, irrespective of how degraded it makes them feel. The same reasoning applies to the previous two bullets, which use self-interest as a means to the end of beneficence, rather than for its own purposes, as the theory would dictate.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Altruism, ultimately, denies an individual's value and is therefore destructive both to society and its individual components, viewing life merely as a thing to be sacrificed. Philosopher [[Ayn Rand]] is quoted as writing that, "[i]f a man accepts the ethics of altruism, his first concern is not how to live his life but how to sacrifice it."&lt;ref&gt;Rachels 2008, p. 535, where this argument is attributed to [[Ayn Rand]], "a writer little heeded by professional philosophers but who nevertheless was enormously popular on college campuses in the 1960s and 1970s".&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, "[t]he basic principle of altruism is that man has no right to exist for his own sake, that service to others is the only justification for his existence, and that self-sacrifice is his highest moral duty, virtue or value." Rather, she writes, "[t]he purpose of morality is to teach you, not to suffer and die, but to enjoy yourself and live."&lt;ref&gt;Rand, Ayn, "Faith and Force: Destroyers of the Modern World," ''Philosophy: Who Needs It'', p. 74; ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'', 1957, Random House, p. 1014; "Faith and Force," p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;
*All of our commonly accepted moral duties, from doing no harm unto others to speaking always the truth to keeping promises, are rooted in the one fundamental principle of self-interest.
*It has been observed, however, that the very act of eating (especially, when there are others starving in the world) is such an act of self-interested discrimination. Ethical egoists such as Rand who readily acknowledge the (conditional) value of others to an individual, and who readily endorse empathy for others, have argued the exact reverse from Rachels, that it is altruism which discriminates: "If the sensation of eating a cake is a value, then why is it an immoral indulgence in your stomach, but a moral goal for you to achieve in the stomach of others?"&lt;ref&gt;Rand, Ayn, ''Atlas Shrugged'', 1957, Random House.&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore altruism which is an arbitrary position, according to Rand.

==Criticism==
It has been argued that extreme ethical egoism is self-defeating. Faced with a situation of limited resources, egoists would consume as much of the resource as they could, making the overall situation worse for everybody. Egoists may respond that if the situation becomes worse for everybody, that would include the egoist, so it is not, in fact, in his or her rational self-interest to take things to such extremes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-252577/ethics "Ethics"] ''Britannica''&lt;/ref&gt; However, the (unregulated) [[tragedy of the commons]] and the (one off) [[prisoner's dilemma]] are cases in which, on the one hand, it is rational for an individual to seek to take as much as possible ''even though'' that makes things worse for everybody, and on the other hand, those cases are not self-refuting since that behaviour remains rational ''even though'' it is ultimately self-defeating, i.e. self-defeating does not imply self-refuting. A tragedy of the commons, however, assumes some degree of public land. That is, a commons forbidding homesteading requires regulation. Thus, an argument against the tragedy of the commons is fundamentally an argument for private property rights and the system that recognizes both property rights and rational self-interest—capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Block |first1=Walter |title=Environmentalism and Economic Freedom: The Case for Private Property Rights |journal=[[Journal of Business Ethics]] |volume=17 |issue=16 |pages=18871899 |date=1998 |issn=0167-4544 |jstor=25074025 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, an increasing respect for individual rights uniquely allows for increasing wealth creation and increasing usable resources despite a fixed amount of raw materials (e.g. the West pre-1776 versus post-1776, East versus West Germany, Hong Kong versus mainland China, North versus South Korea, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.juliansimon.org/writings/Ultimate_Resource/ |title= The Ultimate Resource II: People, Materials, and Environment (1996) | author=Julian Simon |accessdate=2014-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not clear how to apply a private ownership model to many examples of "Commons", however. Examples include large fisheries, the atmosphere and the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environmentmagazine.org/Archives/Back%20Issues/July-August%202008/ostrom-full.html " The Challenge of Common-Pool Resources"] ''Environment Magazine''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dummies.com/education/science/environmental-science/ten-real-life-examples-of-the-tragedy-of-the-commons/ "Ten Real-life Examples of the Tragedy of the Commons"] ''Environmental Science for Dummies''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable proponents==
The term ''ethical egoism'' has been applied retroactively to philosophers such as [[Bernard de Mandeville]] and to many other [[Dialectical materialism|materialist]]s of his generation, although none of them declared themselves to be egoists. Note that materialism does not necessarily imply egoism, as indicated by [[Karl Marx]], and the many other [[materialist]]s who espoused forms of [[collectivism]]. It has been argued that ethical egoism can lend itself to [[individualist anarchism]] such as that of [[Benjamin Tucker]], or the combined [[anarcho-communism]] and egoism of [[Emma Goldman]], both of whom were proponents of many egoist ideas put forward by [[Max Stirner]]. In this context, egoism is another way of describing the sense that the common good should be enjoyed by all. However, most notable anarchists in history have been less radical, retaining altruism and a sense of the importance of the individual that is appreciable but does not go as far as egoism. Recent trends to greater appreciation of egoism within [[anarchism]] tend to come from less classical directions such as [[post-left anarchy]] or [[Situationism]] (e.g. [[Raoul Vaneigem]]). Egoism has also been referenced by [[Anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]], such as [[Murray Rothbard]].

Philosopher [[Max Stirner]], in his book ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'', was the first philosopher to call himself an egoist, though his writing makes clear that he desired not a new idea of morality (ethical egoism), but rather a rejection of morality ([[amoralism]]), as a nonexistent and limiting "spook"; for this, Stirner has been described as the first [[Individualist anarchism|individualist anarchist]]. Other philosophers, such as [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[David Gauthier]], have argued that the conflicts which arise when people each pursue their own ends can be resolved for the best of each individual only if they all voluntarily forgo some of their aims—that is, one's self-interest is often best pursued by allowing others to pursue their self-interest as well so that liberty is equal among individuals. Sacrificing one's short-term self-interest to maximize one's long-term self-interest is one form of "[[Rational selfishness|rational self-interest]]" which is the idea behind most philosophers' advocacy of ethical egoism. Egoists have also argued that one's actual interests are not immediately obvious, and that the pursuit of self-interest involves more than merely the acquisition of some good, but the ''maximizing'' of one's chances of survival and/or happiness.

Philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] suggested that egoistic or "life-affirming" behavior stimulates jealousy or "[[ressentiment]]" in others, and that this is the psychological motive for the altruism in [[Christianity]]. Sociologist [[Helmut Schoeck]] similarly considered [[envy]] the motive of collective efforts by society to reduce the disproportionate gains of successful individuals through moral or legal constraints, with altruism being primary among these.&lt;ref&gt;[[Helmut Schoeck|Schoeck, Helmut]], ''Der Neid. Eine Theorie der Gesellschaft'' (''Envy. A Theory of Social Behaviour''), 1966, 1st English ed. 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, Nietzsche (in ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'') and [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] (in ''[[After Virtue]]'') have pointed out that the [[ancient Greeks]] did not associate [[morality]] with altruism in the way that post-Christian [[Western culture|Western civilization]] has done.
[[Aristotle]]'s view is that we have duties to ourselves as well as to other people (e.g. friends) and to the ''[[polis]]'' as a whole. The same is true for [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] and [[Immanuel Kant]], who claim that there are duties to ourselves as Aristotle did, although it has been argued that, for Aristotle, the duty to one's self is primary.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, Jack, "Rand and Aristotle," in Den Uyl and Rasmussen, ''[[The Philosophic Thought of Ayn Rand]]'', 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ayn Rand]] argued that there is a positive harmony of interests among free, rational humans, such that no moral agent can rationally coerce another person consistently with his own long-term self-interest. Rand argued that other people are an enormous value to an individual's well-being (through education, trade and affection), but also that this value could be fully realized only under conditions of political and economic freedom. According to Rand, voluntary trade alone can assure that human interaction is ''mutually'' beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;Rand, Ayn, ''[[The Virtue of Selfishness]]'' (1964).&lt;/ref&gt; Rand's student, [[Leonard Peikoff]] has argued that the identification of one's interests itself is impossible absent the use of principles, and that self-interest cannot be consistently pursued absent a consistent adherence to certain ethical principles.&lt;ref&gt;Peikoff, Leonard, "Why Should One Act on Principle?," ''The Objectivist Forum'', 1988, originally delivered at the [[Ford Hall Forum]].&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, Rand's position has also been defended by such writers as [[Tara Smith (philosopher)|Tara Smith]], [[Tibor Machan]], [[Allan Gotthelf]], [[David Kelley]], [[Douglas Rasmussen]], [[Nathaniel Branden]], [[Harry Binswanger]], [[Andrew Bernstein]], and [[Craig Biddle]].

Philosopher [[David L. Norton]] identified himself an "ethical individualist", and, like Rand, saw a harmony between an individual's fidelity to his own self-actualization, or "personal destiny", and the achievement of society's well being.&lt;ref&gt;[[David L. Norton|Norton, David]], ''Personal Destinies: A Philosophy of Ethical Individualism'', 1976, [[Princeton University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Existentialism''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɛ|g|z|ɪ|ˈ|s|t|ɛ|n|ʃ|əl|ɪ|z|əm}})&lt;ref&gt;Oxford University Press, [http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/existentialism "Oxford Dictionary: 'existentialism'"], ''Oxford English Dictionary'', Retrieved 22 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; is a tradition of philosophical inquiry associated mainly with certain 19th and 20th-century [[Europe]]an philosophers who, despite profound doctrinal differences,&lt;ref name="Crowell-SEoP"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/existentialism/ |title=Existentialism |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |author=Crowell, Steven |date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Macquarrie, ''Existentialism'', New York (1972), pp. 18–21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Philosophy 1995 p. 259"&gt;''Oxford Companion to Philosophy'', ed. Ted Honderich, New York (1995), p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt; shared the belief that philosophical thinking begins with the human subject—not merely the thinking subject, but the acting, feeling, living human [[individual]].&lt;ref&gt;John Macquarie, ''Existentialism'', New York (1972), pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt; While the predominant value of existentialist thought is commonly acknowledged to be freedom, its primary virtue is [[authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Existentialism - A Very Short Introduction|last = Flynn|first = Thomas|publisher = Oxford University Press Inc.|year = 2006|isbn = 0-19-280428-6|location = New York|page = xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the view of the existentialist, the individual's starting point is characterized by what has been called "the existential attitude", or a sense of disorientation, confusion, or [[Existential dread|dread]] in the face of an apparently meaningless or [[Absurdism|absurd]] world.&lt;ref name="Robert C. Solomon 1974, pp. 1"&gt;Robert C. Solomon, ''Existentialism'' (McGraw-Hill, 1974, pp. 1–2).&lt;/ref&gt; Many existentialists have also regarded traditional systematic or academic philosophies, in both style and content, as too abstract and remote from concrete human experience.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Breisach, ''Introduction to Modern Existentialism'', New York (1962), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walter Kaufmann, ''Existentialism: From Dostoyevesky to Sartre'', New York (1956) p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Søren Kierkegaard]] is generally considered to have been the first existentialist philosopher,&lt;ref name="Crowell-SEoP"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marino, Gordon.

''Kierkegaard's attack upon "Christendom"'' (Princeton, 1969, pp. 37–40).&lt;/ref&gt; Existentialism became popular in the years following [[World War II]], and strongly influenced many disciplines besides [[philosophy]], including theology, drama, art, literature, and psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=NSvRzPye-gEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=psychoanalysis |last=Guignon and Pereboom, Derk |first=Charles B. |title=Existentialism: basic writings |publisher=Hackett Publishing |year=2001 |page=xiii |isbn=9780872205956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The term "existentialism" (French: ''L'existentialisme'') was coined by the [[Roman Catholicism in France|French Catholic]] philosopher [[Gabriel Marcel]] in the mid-1940s.&lt;ref&gt;D.E. Cooper ''Existentialism: A Reconstruction'' (Basil Blackwell, 1990, p. 1)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thomas R. Flynn 2006, page 89"&gt;Thomas R. Flynn, ''Existentialism: A Very Short Introduction'' (Oxford University Press), 2006, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Christine Daigle 2006, page 5"&gt;Christine Daigle, ''Existentialist Thinkers and Ethics'' (McGill-Queen's press, 2006, p. 5)&lt;/ref&gt; At first, when Marcel applied the term to him at a colloquium in 1945, [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] rejected it.&lt;ref&gt;
Ann Fulton, Apostles of Sartre: Existentialism in America, 1945–1963 (Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press, 1999) 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt; Sartre subsequently changed his mind and, on October 29, 1945, publicly adopted the existentialist label in a lecture to the ''Club Maintenant'' in [[Paris]]. The lecture was published as ''[[L'existentialisme est un humanisme]]'' (''[[Existentialism is a Humanism]]''), a short book that did much to popularize existentialist thought.&lt;ref&gt;''L'Existentialisme est un Humanisme'' (Editions Nagel, 1946); ''English'' Jean-Paul Sartre, ''Existentialism and Humanism'' (Eyre Methuen, 1948)&lt;/ref&gt; Marcel later came to reject the label himself in favour of the term Neo-Socratic, in honor of Kierkegaard's essay "On The Concept of Irony".

Some scholars argue that the term should be used only to refer to the cultural movement in Europe in the 1940s and 1950s associated with the works of the philosophers [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], and [[Albert Camus]].&lt;ref name="Crowell-SEoP"/&gt; Other scholars extend the term to Kierkegaard, and yet others extend it as far back as [[Socrates]].&lt;ref&gt;Crowell, Steven. ''The Cambridge Companion to Existentialism'', Cambridge, 2011, p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term is often identified with the philosophical views of Jean-Paul Sartre.&lt;ref name="Crowell-SEoP"/&gt;

==Definitional issues and background==
The labels ''existentialism'' and ''existentialist'' are often seen as historical conveniences in as far as they were first applied to many philosophers in hindsight, long after they had died. In fact, while existentialism is generally considered to have originated with Kierkegaard, the first prominent existentialist philosopher to adopt the term as a self-description was [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. Sartre posits the idea that "what all existentialists have in common is the fundamental doctrine that [[existence precedes essence]]", as scholar [[Frederick Copleston]] explains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Existentialism | journal = Philosophy | first = F.C. | last = Copleston | volume = 23 | issue = 84 | pages = 19–37 | jstor = 4544850 | doi = 10.1017/S0031819100065955 | year = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to philosopher [[Steven Crowell]], defining existentialism has been relatively difficult, and he argues that it is better [[understanding|understood]] as a general approach used to reject certain systematic philosophies rather than as a systematic philosophy itself.&lt;ref name="Crowell-SEoP"/&gt; Sartre himself, in a lecture delivered in 1945, described existentialism as "the attempt to draw all the consequences from a position of consistent [[atheism]]".&lt;ref&gt;See [[James Wood (critic)|James Wood]]'s introduction to {{Cite book |last = Sartre |first = Jean-Paul |year = 2000 |title = Nausea |location = London |publisher = [[Penguin Classics]] |isbn = 978-0-141-18549-1 }} Quote on p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CGbBbtDOZbwC&amp;pg=PT5 vii].&lt;/ref&gt;

Although many outside [[Scandinavia]] consider the term existentialism to have originated from Kierkegaard himself{{who|date=May 2018}}, it is more likely that Kierkegaard adopted this term (or at least the term "existential" as a description of his philosophy) from the Norwegian poet and literary critic [[Johan Sebastian Cammermeyer Welhaven]].&lt;ref&gt;Tidsskrift for Norsk Psykologforening, Vol 45, nummer 10, 2008, side 1298–1304, [http://www.psykologtidsskriftet.no/index.php?seks_id=61613&amp;a=2 Welhaven og psykologien: Del 2. Welhaven peker fremover] (in Norwegian)&lt;/ref&gt; This assertion comes from two sources. The Norwegian philosopher Erik Lundestad refers to the Danish philosopher Fredrik Christian Sibbern. Sibbern is supposed to have had two conversations in 1841, the first with Welhaven and the second with Kierkegaard. It is in the first conversation that it is believed that Welhaven came up with "a word that he said covered a certain thinking, which had a close and positive attitude to life, a relationship he described as existential".&lt;ref&gt;Lundestad, 1998, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; This was then brought to Kierkegaard by Sibbern.

The second claim comes from the Norwegian historian [[Rune Slagstad]], who claims to prove that Kierkegaard himself said the term "existential" was borrowed from the poet. He strongly believes that it was Kierkegaard himself who said that "[[Hegelianism|Hegelians]] do not study philosophy 'existentially'; to use a phrase by Welhaven from one time when I spoke with him about philosophy".&lt;ref&gt;Slagstad, 2001, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concepts ==

=== Existence precedes essence ===
{{Main|Existence precedes essence}}

Sartre claimed that a central proposition of Existentialism is that ''existence precedes [[essence]]'', which means that the most important consideration for individuals is that they are individuals—independently acting and responsible, conscious beings ("existence")—rather than what labels, roles, stereotypes, definitions, or other preconceived categories the individuals fit ("essence"). The actual life of the individuals is what constitutes what could be called their "true essence" instead of there being an arbitrarily attributed essence others use to define them. Thus, human beings, through their own [[consciousness]], create their own values and determine a meaning to their life.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} (Dictionary) "L'existencialisme" – see "l'identité de la personne"&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was Sartre who explicitly coined the phrase, similar notions can be found in the thought of existentialist philosophers such as [[Heidegger]], and [[Kierkegaard]]:

{{Quotation|"The subjective ''thinker’s form'', the form of his communication, is his ''style''. His form must be just as manifold as are the opposites that he holds together. The systematic ''eins, zwei, drei'' is an abstract form that also must inevitably run into trouble whenever it is to be applied to the concrete. To the same degree as the subjective thinker is concrete, to the same degree his form must also be concretely dialectical. But just as he himself is not a poet, not an ethicist, not a dialectician, so also his form is none of these directly. His form must first and last be related to existence, and in this regard he must have at his disposal the poetic, the ethical, the dialectical, the religious. Subordinate character, setting, etc., which belong to the well-balanced character of the esthetic production, are in themselves breadth; the subjective thinker has only one setting—existence—and has nothing to do with localities and such things. The setting is not the fairyland of the imagination, where poetry produces consummation, nor is the setting laid in England, and historical accuracy is not a concern. The setting is inwardness in existing as a human being; the concretion is the relation of the existence-categories to one another. Historical accuracy and historical actuality are breadth." Søren Kierkegaard (Concluding Postscript, Hong pp. 357–58)}}

Some interpret the imperative to define oneself as meaning that anyone can wish to be anything. However, an existentialist philosopher would say such a wish constitutes an inauthentic existence - what Sartre would call '[[bad faith (existentialism)|bad faith]]'. Instead, the phrase should be taken to say that people are (1) defined only insofar as they act and (2) that they are responsible for their actions. For example, someone who acts cruelly towards other people is, by that act, defined as a cruel person. Furthermore, by this action of cruelty, such persons are themselves responsible for their new identity (cruel persons). This is as opposed to their genes, or ''human nature'', bearing the blame.

As Sartre says in his lecture ''[[Existentialism is a Humanism]]'': "... man first of all exists, encounters himself, surges up in the world—and defines himself afterwards". The more positive, therapeutic aspect of this is also implied: A person can choose to act in a different way, and to be a good person instead of a cruel person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Baird |first=Forrest E. |authorlink= |author2=Walter Kaufmann |title=From Plato to Derrida |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |year=2008 |location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey |pages= |url= |doi= |isbn=0-13-158591-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sartre's definition of existentialism was based on Heidegger's magnum opus ''[[Being and Time]]''. In the correspondence with [[Jean Beaufret]] later published as the ''[[Letter on Humanism]]'', Heidegger implies that Sartre misunderstood him for his own purposes of subjectivism, and that he did not mean that actions take precedence over being so long as those actions were not reflected upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/26355951|title=Basic Writings: From Being and Time (1927) to The Task of Thinking (1964)|last=Heidegger|first=Martin|publisher=Harper San Francisco|others=Edited by David Farrell Krell|year=1993|isbn=0060637633|edition=Revised and expanded|location=San Francisco, California|pages=|oclc=26355951}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heidegger commented that "the reversal of a metaphysical statement remains a metaphysical statement", meaning that he thought Sartre had simply switched the roles traditionally attributed to essence and existence without interrogating these concepts and their history in the way that Heidegger claimed to have done.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/26355951|title=Basic Writings: From Being and Time (1927) to The Task of thinking (1964)|last=Heidegger|first=Martin|publisher=Harper San Francisco|others=Edited by David Farrell Krell|year=1993|isbn=0060637633|edition=Revised and expanded|location=San Francisco, California|pages=243|oclc=26355951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Absurd ===
{{Main|Absurdism}}

The notion of the [[Absurdism|Absurd]] contains the idea that there is no meaning in the world beyond what meaning we give it. This meaninglessness also encompasses the amorality or "unfairness" of the world. This conceptualization can be highlighted in the way it opposes the traditional [[Abrahamic religions|Judeo-Christian-Islamic]] perspective, which establishes that life's purpose is about the fulfillment of God's commandments.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Existentialism: A Beginner's Guide|last=Wartenberg|first=Thomas|publisher=One World|year=2008|isbn=9781780740201|location=Oxford|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a purpose is what gives meaning to people's lives. To live the life of the absurd means rejecting a life that finds or pursues specific meaning for man's existence since there is nothing to be discovered. According to Albert Camus, the world or the human being is not in itself absurd. The concept only emerges through the [[juxtaposition]] of the two, where life becomes absurd due to the incompatibility between human beings and the world they inhabit.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  This view constitutes one of the two interpretations of the absurd in existentialist literature. The second view, which was first elaborated by  [[Søren Kierkegaard]], holds that absurdity is limited to actions and choices of human beings. These are considered absurd since they issue from human freedom, undermining their foundation outside of themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The A to Z of Existentialism|last=Michelman|first=Stephen|publisher=The Scarecrow Press, Inc.|year=2010|isbn=9780810875890|location=Lanham, Maryland|pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of the absurd in existentialism  contrasts with the claim that "bad things don't happen to good people"; to the world, metaphorically speaking, there is no such thing as a good person or a bad person; what happens happens, and it may just as well happen to a "good" person as to a "bad" person.&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Existentialism, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/existentialism/#AnxNotAbs 3.1 Anxiety, Nothingness, the Absurd]&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the world's absurdity, at any point in time, anything can happen to anyone, and a tragic event could plummet someone into direct confrontation with the Absurd. The notion of the Absurd has been prominent in literature throughout history. Many of the literary works of [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Franz Kafka]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], [[Eugène Ionesco]], [[Miguel de Unamuno]], [[Luigi Pirandello]],&lt;ref name=luigitheatre&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bassnett|first1=Susan|last2=Lorch|first2=Jennifer|title=Luigi Pirandello in the Theatre|date=March 18, 2014|publisher=Routledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FpwiAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA182&amp;dq=luigi+pirandello+existentialism#v=onepage&amp;q=existentialist|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=understandex&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thompson|first1=Mel|last2=Rodgers|first2=Nigel|title=Understanding Existentialism: Teach Yourself|date=2010|publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vfczAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT105&amp;dq=pirandello+existentialism#v=onepage&amp;q=pirandello%20existentialism}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=crisisconsciousness&gt;{{cite book|last1=Caputi|first1=Anthony Francis|title=Pirandello and the Crisis of Modern Consciousness|date=1988|publisher=University of Illinois Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Qv2nuJF7yYC&amp;pg=PA80&amp;dq=pirandello+existential+absurd#v=onepage&amp;q=pirandello%20existentialist%20absurdity}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=masks&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mariani|first1=Umberto|title=Living Masks: The Achievement of Pirandello|date=2010|publisher=University of Toronto Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vBviYn43H34C&amp;pg=PT178&amp;dq=pirandello+existential+absurd#v=onepage&amp;q=pirandello%20existential%20absurd|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Joseph Heller]] and [[Albert Camus]] contain descriptions of people who encounter the absurdity of the world.

It is in relation to the concept of the devastating awareness of meaninglessness that Albert Camus claimed that "there is only one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide" in his ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]''. Although "prescriptions" against the possibly deleterious consequences of these kinds of encounters vary, from Kierkegaard's religious "stage" to Camus' insistence on persevering in spite of absurdity, the concern with helping people avoid living their lives in ways that put them in the perpetual danger of having everything meaningful break down is common to most existentialist philosophers. The possibility of having everything meaningful break down poses a threat of [[Quietism (philosophy)|quietism]], which is inherently against the existentialist philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jean-Paul Sartre |url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/sartre/works/exist/sartre.htm |title=Existentialism is a Humanism, Jean-Paul Sartre 1946 |publisher=Marxists.org |accessdate=2010-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been said that the possibility of [[suicide]] makes all humans existentialists. The ultimate hero of absurdism lives without meaning and faces suicide without succumbing to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Suicide and Self-Deception|author=E Keen|publisher=Psychoanalytic Review|year=1973|url=http://www.pep-web.org/document.php?id=PSAR.060.0575A|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Facticity ===
{{main|Facticity}}

Facticity is a concept defined by Sartre in ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'' as the ''[[being-in-itself|in-itself]]'', which delineates for humans the modalities of being and not being. This can be more easily understood when considering facticity in relation to the temporal dimension of our past: one's past is what one is, in the sense that it co-constitutes oneself. However, to say that one is only one's past would be to ignore a significant part of reality (the present and the future), while saying that one's past is only what one was, would entirely detach it from oneself now. A denial of one's own concrete past constitutes an inauthentic lifestyle, and the same goes for all other kinds of facticity (having a human body — e.g., one that doesn't allow a person to run faster than the speed of sound — identity, values, etc.).&lt;ref name="2.1 Facticity and Transcendence"&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Existentialism, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/existentialism/#FacTra 2.1 Facticity and Transcendence]&lt;/ref&gt;

Facticity is both a limitation and a condition of freedom. It is a limitation in that a large part of one's facticity consists of things one couldn't have chosen (birthplace, etc.), but a condition of freedom in the sense that one's values most likely depend on it. However, even though one's facticity is "set in stone" (as being past, for instance), it cannot determine a person: The value ascribed to one's facticity is still ascribed to it freely by that person. As an example, consider two men, one of whom has no memory of his past and the other who remembers everything. They both have committed many crimes, but the first man, knowing nothing about this, leads a rather normal life while the second man, feeling trapped by his own past, continues a life of crime, blaming his own past for "trapping" him in this life. There is nothing essential about his committing crimes, but he ascribes this meaning to his past.

However, to disregard one's facticity when, in the continual process of self-making, one projects oneself into the future, that would be to put oneself in denial of oneself, and thus would be inauthentic. In other words, the origin of one's projection must still be one's facticity, though in the mode of not being it (essentially). An example of one focusing solely on one's possible projects without reflecting on one's current facticity:&lt;ref name="2.1 Facticity and Transcendence"/&gt; if one continually thinks about future possibilities related to being rich (e.g. a better car, bigger house, better quality of life, etc.) without considering the facticity of ''not currently having the financial means to do so''. In this example, considering both facticity and transcendence, an authentic mode of being would be considering future projects that might improve one's current finances (e.g. putting in extra hours, or investing savings) in order to arrive at a ''future-facticity'' of a modest pay rise, further leading to purchase of an affordable car.

Another aspect of facticity is that it entails [[angst]], both in the sense that freedom "produces" angst when limited by facticity, and in the sense that the lack of the possibility of having facticity to "step in" for one to take responsibility for something one has done, also produces angst.

Another aspect of existential freedom is that one can change one's values.  Thus, one is responsible for one's values, regardless of society's values.  The focus on [[freedom]] in existentialism is related to the limits of the responsibility one bears, as a result of one's freedom: the relationship between freedom and responsibility is one of interdependency, and a clarification of freedom also clarifies that for which one is responsible.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Existentialism, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/existentialism/#FreVal 3. Freedom and Value]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Existentialism, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/existentialism/#IdeVal 3.2 The Ideality of Values]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Authenticity ===
{{main|Authenticity (philosophy)|l1=Authenticity}}

Many noted existentialist writers consider the theme of authentic existence important. Authentic existence involves the idea that one has to "create oneself" and then live in accordance with this self. What is meant by [[authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]] is that in acting, one should act as oneself, not as "one's acts" or as "one's genes" or any other essence requires. The authentic act is one that is in accordance with one's freedom. As a condition of freedom is facticity, this includes one's facticity, but not to the degree that this facticity can in any way determine one's transcendent choices (in the sense that one could then blame one's background [facticity] for making the choice one made [chosen project, from one's transcendence]). The role of facticity in relation to authenticity involves letting one's actual values come into play when one makes a choice (instead of, like Kierkegaard's Aesthete, "choosing" randomly), so that one also takes responsibility for the act instead of choosing either-or without allowing the options to have different values.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Existentialism, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/existentialism/#Aut 2.3 Authenticity]&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to this, the inauthentic is the denial to live in accordance with one's freedom. This can take many forms, from pretending choices are meaningless or random, through convincing oneself that some form of [[determinism]] is true, to a sort of "mimicry" where one acts as "one should".

How "one should" act is often determined by an image one has, of how one such as oneself (say, a bank manager, lion tamer, prostitute, etc.) acts. In [[Being and Nothingness]], Sartre relates an example of a "[[waiter]]" in ''bad faith'': he merely takes part in the "act" of being a typical waiter, albeit very convincingly.&lt;ref name="Jean-Paul Sartre 2003"&gt;Jean-Paul Sartre, ''Being and Nothingness'', Routledge Classics (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; This image usually corresponds to some sort of social norm, but this does not mean that all acting in accordance with social norms is inauthentic: The main point is the attitude one takes to one's own freedom and responsibility, and the extent to which one acts in accordance with this freedom.

=== The Other and the Look ===
{{main|Other (philosophy)}}

The Other (when written with a capital "O") is a concept more properly belonging to [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and its account of [[intersubjectivity]]. However, the concept has seen widespread use in existentialist writings, and the conclusions drawn from it differ slightly from the phenomenological accounts. The experience of the Other is the experience of another free subject who inhabits the same world as a person does. In its most basic form, it is this experience of the Other that constitutes intersubjectivity and objectivity. To clarify, when one experiences someone else, and this Other person experiences the world (the same world that a person experiences)—only from "over there"—the world itself is constituted as objective in that it is something that is "there" as identical for both of the subjects; a person experiences the other person as experiencing the same things. This experience of the Other's look is what is termed the Look (sometimes [[the Gaze]]).&lt;ref&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Existentialism, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/existentialism/#Ali 2.2 Alienation]&lt;/ref&gt;

While this experience, in its basic phenomenological sense, constitutes the world as objective, and oneself as objectively existing subjectivity (one experiences oneself as seen in the Other's Look in precisely the same way that one experiences the Other as seen by him, as subjectivity), in existentialism, it also acts as a kind of limitation of freedom. This is because the Look tends to objectify what it sees. As such, when one experiences oneself in the Look, one doesn't experience oneself as nothing (no thing), but as something. Sartre's own example of a man peeping at someone through a keyhole can help clarify this: at first, this man is entirely caught up in the situation he is in; he is in a pre-reflexive state where his entire consciousness is directed at what goes on in the room. Suddenly, he hears a creaking floorboard behind him, and he becomes aware of himself as seen by the Other. He is thus filled with shame for he perceives himself as he would perceive someone else doing what he was doing, as a [[Peeping Tom]]. The Look is then co-constitutive of one's facticity.

Another characteristic feature of the Look is that no Other really needs to have been there: It is quite possible that the creaking floorboard was nothing but the movement of an old house; the Look isn't some kind of mystical telepathic experience of the actual way the other sees one (there may also have been someone there, but he could have not noticed that the person was there). It is only one's perception of the way another might perceive him.

=== Angst and dread ===
{{main|Angst}}
{{See also|Living educational theory}}

"Existential [[angst]]", sometimes called existential dread, anxiety, or [[anguish]], is a term that is common to many existentialist thinkers. It is generally held to be a negative feeling arising from the experience of human freedom and responsibility. The archetypical example is the experience one has when standing on a cliff where one not only fears falling off it, but also dreads the possibility of throwing oneself off. In this experience that "nothing is holding me back", one senses the lack of anything that predetermines one to either throw oneself off or to stand still, and one experiences one's own freedom. Angst, according to the modern existentialist, [[Adam Fong]], is the sudden realization of a lack of meaning, often while one completes a task that initially seems to have intrinsic meaning.&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt;

It can also be seen in relation to the previous point how angst is before nothing, and this is what sets it apart from fear that has an object. While in the case of fear, one can take definitive measures to remove the object of fear, in the case of angst, no such "constructive" measures are possible. The use of the word "nothing" in this context relates both to the inherent insecurity about the consequences of one's actions, and to the fact that, in experiencing freedom as angst, one also realizes that one is fully responsible for these consequences. There is nothing in people (genetically, for instance) that acts in their stead—that they can blame if something goes wrong. Therefore, not every choice is perceived as having dreadful possible consequences (and, it can be claimed, human lives would be unbearable if every choice facilitated dread). However, this doesn't change the fact that freedom remains a condition of every action.

=== Despair ===
{{Main|Philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard#Despair|l1=Despair}}
{{See also|Existential crisis}}

Despair, in existentialism, is generally defined as a loss of hope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tfd.com/despair |title=despair - definition of despair by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Tfd.com |accessdate=2010-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, it is a loss of hope in reaction to a breakdown in one or more of the defining qualities of one's self or identity. If a person is invested in being a particular thing, such as a bus driver or an upstanding citizen, and then finds their being-thing compromised, they would normally be found in a state of despair—a hopeless state. For example, a singer who loses the ability to sing may despair if they have nothing else to fall back on—nothing to rely on for their identity. They find themselves unable to be what defined their being.

What sets the existentialist notion of despair apart from the conventional definition is that existentialist despair is a state one is in even when they aren't overtly in despair. So long as a person's identity depends on qualities that can crumble, they are in perpetual despair—and as there is, in Sartrean terms, no human essence found in conventional reality on which to constitute the individual's sense of identity, despair is a universal human condition. As Kierkegaard defines it in ''[[Either/Or]]'': "Let each one learn what he can; both of us can learn that a person’s unhappiness never lies in his lack of control over external conditions, since this would only make him completely unhappy."&lt;ref&gt;Either/Or Part II p. 188 Hong&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Works of Love]]'', he said: {{Quotation|When the God-forsaken worldliness of earthly life shuts itself in complacency, the confined air develops poison, the moment gets stuck and stands still, the prospect is lost, a need is felt for a refreshing, enlivening breeze to cleanse the air and dispel the poisonous vapors lest we suffocate in worldliness. ... Lovingly to hope all things is the opposite of despairingly to hope [[nothing]] at all. Love hopes all things—yet is never put to shame. To relate oneself expectantly to the possibility of the good is to hope. To relate oneself expectantly to the possibility of evil is to fear. By the decision to choose hope one decides infinitely more than it seems, because it is an eternal decision. pp. 246–50}}

==Opposition to positivism and rationalism==
{{See also|Positivism|Rationalism}}

Existentialists oppose definitions of human beings as primarily rational, and, therefore, oppose [[positivism]] and [[rationalism]]. Existentialism asserts that people actually make decisions based on subjective meaning rather than pure rationality. The rejection of reason as the source of meaning is a common theme of existentialist thought, as is the focus on the feelings of [[anxiety]] and [[angst|dread]] that we feel in the face of our own radical [[free will|freedom]] and our awareness of death. Kierkegaard advocated rationality as a means to interact with the objective world (e.g., in the natural sciences), but when it comes to existential problems, reason is insufficient: "Human reason has boundaries".&lt;ref&gt;''Søren Kierkegaard's Journals and Papers'' Vol 5, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Kierkegaard, Sartre saw problems with rationality, calling it a form of "bad faith", an attempt by the self to impose structure on a world of phenomena—"the Other"—that is fundamentally irrational and random. According to Sartre, rationality and other forms of bad faith hinder people from finding meaning in freedom. To try to suppress their feelings of anxiety and dread, people confine themselves within everyday experience, Sartre asserts, thereby relinquishing their freedom and acquiescing to being possessed in one form or another by "the Look" of "the Other" (i.e., possessed by another person—or at least one's idea of that other person).

== Religion ==
{{See also|Atheistic existentialism|Christian existentialism|Jewish existentialism}}

An existentialist reading of the [[Bible]] would demand that the reader recognize that (s)he is an existing [[subject (philosophy)|subject]] studying the words more as a recollection of events. This is in contrast to looking at a collection of "truths" that are outside and unrelated to the reader, but may develop a sense of reality/God. Such a reader is not obligated to follow the commandments as if an external agent is forcing these commandments upon them, but as though they are inside them and guiding them from inside. This is the task Kierkegaard takes up when he asks: "Who has the more difficult task: the teacher who lectures on earnest things a meteor's distance from everyday life - or the learner who should put it to use?"&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard, Soren. ''Works of Love''. Harper &amp; Row, Publishers. New York, N.Y. 1962. p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

== Confusion with nihilism ==
{{See also|Existential nihilism}}

Although [[nihilism]] and existentialism are distinct philosophies, they are often confused with one another as both are rooted in the human experience of anguish and confusion stemming from the apparent meaninglessness of a world in which humans are compelled to find or create meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/nihilism/#H3 |title=Nihilism |author=Alan Pratt |date=April 23, 2001 |work=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=[[Embry-Riddle University]] |accessdate=November 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A primary cause of confusion is that [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] is an important philosopher in both fields. Existentialist philosophers often stress the importance of [[Angst]] as signifying the absolute lack of any objective ground for action, a move that is often reduced to a [[Moral nihilism|moral]] or an [[existential nihilism]]. A pervasive theme in the works of existentialist philosophy, however, is to persist through encounters with the absurd, as seen in [[Albert Camus|Camus]]' ''The Myth of Sisyphus'' ("One must imagine Sisyphus happy"),&lt;ref&gt;Camus, Albert. "The Myth of Sisyphus". [http://www.nyu.edu/classes/keefer/hell/camus.html NYU.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; and it is only very rarely that existentialist philosophers dismiss morality or one's self-created meaning: Kierkegaard regained a sort of morality in the religious (although he wouldn't himself agree that it was ethical; the religious suspends the ethical), and [[Jean-Paul Sartre|Sartre]]'s final words in ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'' are "All these questions, which refer us to a pure and not an accessory (or impure) reflection, can find their reply only on the ethical plane. We shall devote to them a future work."&lt;ref name="Jean-Paul Sartre 2003"/&gt;

== History ==

=== 19th century ===

==== Kierkegaard and Nietzsche ====
{{Main|Søren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche}}

[[Søren Kierkegaard]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] were two of the first philosophers considered fundamental to the existentialist movement, though neither used the term "existentialism" and it is unclear whether they would have supported the existentialism of the 20th century. They focused on subjective human experience rather than the objective truths of mathematics and science, which they believed were too detached or observational to truly get at the human experience. Like [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]], they were interested in people's quiet struggle with the apparent meaninglessness of life and the use of diversion to escape from [[boredom]]. Unlike Pascal, Kierkegaard and Nietzsche also considered the role of making free choices, particularly regarding fundamental values and beliefs, and how such choices change the nature and identity of the chooser.&lt;ref&gt;Luper, Steven. "Existing". Mayfield Publishing, 2000, pp. 4–5 and 11&lt;/ref&gt; Kierkegaard's [[knight of faith]] and Nietzsche's [[Übermensch]] are representative of people who exhibit [[Free will|Freedom]], in that they define the nature of their own existence. Nietzsche's idealized individual invents his own values and creates the very terms they excel under. By contrast, Kierkegaard, opposed to the level of abstraction in Hegel, and not nearly as hostile (actually welcoming) to [[Christianity]] as Nietzsche, argues through a pseudonym that the objective certainty of religious truths (specifically Christian) is not only impossible, but even founded on logical paradoxes. Yet he continues to imply that a [[leap of faith]] is a possible means for an individual to reach a higher stage of existence that transcends and contains both an aesthetic and ethical value of life. Kierkegaard and Nietzsche were also precursors to other intellectual movements, including [[postmodernism]], and various strands of [[psychology|psychotherapy.]] However, Kierkegaard believed that individuals should live in accordance with their thinking.

====Dostoyevsky====

The first important literary author also important to existentialism was the Russian [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Hubben, William. ''Dostoyevsky, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche and Kafka, Jabber-wacky'', Scribner, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Dostoyevsky's ''[[Notes from Underground]]'' portrays a man unable to fit into society and unhappy with the identities he creates for himself. [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], in his book on existentialism ''[[Existentialism is a Humanism]]'', quoted Dostoyevsky's ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'' as an example of [[existential crisis]]. Sartre attributes Ivan Karamazov's claim, "If God did not exist, everything would be permitted"&lt;ref&gt;Sartre, Jean-Paul. ''Existentialism is a Humanism'' http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/sartre/works/exist/sartre.htm ; Retrieved 2012-04-01.&lt;/ref&gt; to Dostoyevsky himself, though this quote does not appear in the novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egs.edu/faculty/slavoj-zizek/articles/if-there-is-a-god-then-anything-is-permitted/|author=Zizek, Slavoj|title=If there is a God, then everything is permitted|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150417192350/http://www.egs.edu/faculty/slavoj-zizek/articles/if-there-is-a-god-then-anything-is-permitted/|archivedate=2015-04-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a similar sentiment is explicitly stated when Alyosha visits Dimitri in prison. Dimitri mentions his conversations with Rakitin in which the idea that "Then, if He doesn't exist, man is king of the earth, of the universe" allowing the inference contained in Sartre's attribution to remain a valid idea contested within the novel.&lt;ref&gt;Dostoyevsky Fyodor. "[[The Brothers Karamazov]]".&lt;/ref&gt; Other Dostoyevsky novels covered issues raised in existentialist philosophy while presenting story lines divergent from secular existentialism: for example, in ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'', the protagonist Raskolnikov experiences an existential crisis and then moves toward a Christian Orthodox worldview similar to that advocated by Dostoyevsky himself.&lt;ref name="Rukhsana"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/911266433|title=Existentialism and its relevance to the contemporary system of education in India : existentialism and present educational scenario|last=Rukhsana.|first=Akhter,|isbn=3954892774|location=Hamburg|oclc=911266433}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early 20th century ===
{{See also|Martin Heidegger}}

In the first decades of the 20th century, a number of philosophers and writers explored existentialist ideas. The Spanish philosopher [[Miguel de Unamuno y Jugo]], in his 1913 book ''The Tragic Sense of Life in Men and Nations'', emphasized the life of "flesh and bone" as opposed to that of abstract rationalism. Unamuno rejected systematic philosophy in favor of the individual's quest for faith. He retained a sense of the tragic, even absurd nature of the quest, symbolized by his enduring interest in [[Cervantes]]' fictional character [[Don Quixote]]. A novelist, poet and dramatist as well as philosophy professor at the University of Salamanca, Unamuno wrote a short story about a priest's crisis of faith, ''[[San Manuel Bueno, Mártir|Saint Manuel the Good, Martyr]]'', which has been collected in anthologies of existentialist fiction. Another Spanish thinker, [[Ortega y Gasset]], writing in 1914, held that human existence must always be defined as the individual person combined with the concrete circumstances of his life: "''Yo soy yo y mi circunstancia''" ("I am myself and my circumstances"). Sartre likewise believed that human existence is not an abstract matter, but is always situated ("''en situation''").

Although [[Martin Buber]] wrote his major philosophical works in German, and studied and taught at the Universities of Berlin and [[Frankfurt]], he stands apart from the mainstream of German philosophy. Born into a Jewish family in Vienna in 1878, he was also a scholar of Jewish culture and involved at various times in [[Zionism]] and [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidism]]. In 1938, he moved permanently to [[Jerusalem]]. His best-known philosophical work was the short book ''[[I and Thou]]'', published in 1922. For Buber, the fundamental fact of human existence, too readily overlooked by scientific rationalism and abstract philosophical thought, is "man with man", a dialogue that takes place in the so-called "sphere of between" (''"das Zwischenmenschliche"'').&lt;ref&gt;Maurice S. Friedman, ''Martin Buber. The Life of Dialogue'' (University of Chicago press, 1955, p. 85)&lt;/ref&gt;

Two Russian thinkers, [[Lev Shestov]] and [[Nikolai Berdyaev]], became well known as existentialist thinkers during their post-Revolutionary exiles in Paris. Shestov, born into a Ukrainian-Jewish family in Kiev, had launched an attack on rationalism and systematization in philosophy as early as 1905 in his book of aphorisms ''All Things Are Possible''.

Berdyaev, also from Kiev but with a background in the Eastern Orthodox Church, drew a radical distinction between the world of spirit and the everyday world of objects. Human freedom, for Berdyaev, is rooted in the realm of spirit, a realm independent of scientific notions of causation. To the extent the individual human being lives in the objective world, he is estranged from authentic spiritual freedom. "Man" is not to be interpreted naturalistically, but as a being created in God's image, an originator of free, creative acts.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Breisach, ''Introduction to Modern Existentialism'', New York (1962), pp. 173–76&lt;/ref&gt; He published a major work on these themes, ''The Destiny of Man'', in 1931.

[[Gabriel Marcel]], long before coining the term "existentialism", introduced important existentialist themes to a French audience in his early essay "Existence and Objectivity" (1925) and in his ''Metaphysical Journal'' (1927).&lt;ref name="Samuel M. Keen 1967"&gt;Samuel M. Keen, "Gabriel Marcel" in Paul Edwards (ed.) ''The Encyclopaedia of Philosophy'' (Macmillan Publishing Co, 1967)&lt;/ref&gt; A dramatist as well as a philosopher, Marcel found his philosophical starting point in a condition of metaphysical alienation: the human individual searching for harmony in a transient life. Harmony, for Marcel, was to be sought through "secondary reflection", a "dialogical" rather than "dialectical" approach to the world, characterized by "wonder and astonishment" and open to the "presence" of other people and of God rather than merely to "information" about them. For Marcel, such presence implied more than simply being there (as one thing might be in the presence of another thing); it connoted "extravagant" availability, and the willingness to put oneself at the disposal of the other.&lt;ref&gt;John Macquarrie, ''Existentialism'' (Pelican, 1973, p. 110)&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcel contrasted ''secondary reflection'' with abstract, scientific-technical ''primary reflection'', which he associated with the activity of the abstract [[René Descartes|Cartesian]] ego. For Marcel, philosophy was a concrete activity undertaken by a sensing, feeling human being incarnate—embodied—in a concrete world.&lt;ref name="Samuel M. Keen 1967"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Macquarrie, ''Existentialism'' (Pelican, 1973, p. 96)&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] adopted the term "existentialism" for his own philosophy in the 1940s, Marcel's thought has been described as "almost diametrically opposed" to that of Sartre.&lt;ref name="Samuel M. Keen 1967"/&gt; Unlike Sartre, Marcel was a Christian, and became a Catholic convert in 1929.

In Germany, the psychologist and philosopher [[Karl Jaspers]]—who later described existentialism as a "phantom" created by the public&lt;ref&gt;Karl Jaspers, "Philosophical Autobiography" in Paul Arthur Schilpp (ed.) ''The Philosophy of Karl Jaspers (The Library of Living Philosophers IX (Tudor Publishing Company, 1957, p. 75/11)&lt;/ref&gt;—called his own thought, heavily influenced by Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, ''Existenzphilosophie''. For Jaspers, "''Existenz''-philosophy is the way of thought by means of which man seeks to become himself...This way of thought does not cognize objects, but elucidates and makes actual the being of the thinker".&lt;ref&gt;Karl Jaspers, "Philosophical Autobiography" in Paul Arthur Schilpp (ed.) ''The Philosophy of Karl Jaspers (The Library of Living Philosophers IX (Tudor Publishing Company, 1957, p. 40)&lt;/ref&gt;

Jaspers, a professor at the University of [[Heidelberg]], was acquainted with [[Martin Heidegger]], who held a professorship at [[Marburg]] before acceding to Husserl's chair at [[Freiburg]] in 1928. They held many philosophical discussions, but later became estranged over Heidegger's support of [[Nazism|National Socialism]] (Nazism). They shared an admiration for Kierkegaard,&lt;ref&gt;Karl Jaspers, "Philosophical Autobiography" in Paul Arthur Schilpp (ed.) ''The Philosophy of Karl Jaspers (The Library of Living Philosophers IX (Tudor Publishing Company, 1957, p. 75/2 and following)&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 1930s, Heidegger lectured extensively on Nietzsche. Nevertheless, the extent to which Heidegger should be considered an existentialist is debatable. In ''[[Being and Time]]'' he presented a method of rooting philosophical explanations in human existence (''Dasein'') to be analysed in terms of existential categories (''existentiale''); and this has led many commentators to treat him as an important figure in the existentialist movement.

=== After the Second World War ===

Following the [[Second World War]], existentialism became a well-known and significant philosophical and cultural movement, mainly through the public prominence of two French writers, [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Albert Camus]], who wrote best-selling novels, plays and widely read journalism as well as theoretical texts.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Baert, ''The Existentialist Moment; The Rise of Sartre as a Public Intellectual'' (Polity Press, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; These years also saw the growing reputation of Heidegger's book ''[[Being and Time]]'' outside Germany.
[[File:Sartre and de Beauvoir at Balzac Memorial.jpg|thumb|left|upright|French philosophers [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Simone de Beauvoir]]]]

Sartre dealt with existentialist themes in his 1938 novel ''[[Nausea (novel)|Nausea]]'' and the short stories in his 1939 collection ''[[The Wall (book)|The Wall]]'', and had published his treatise on existentialism, ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'', in 1943, but it was in the two years following the liberation of Paris from the German occupying forces that he and his close associates—Camus, Simone de Beauvoir, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and others—became internationally famous as the leading figures of a movement known as existentialism.&lt;ref name="Ronald Aronson 2004"&gt;Ronald Aronson, ''Camus and Sartre'' (University of Chicago Press, 2004, chapter 3 ''passim'')&lt;/ref&gt; In a very short period of time, Camus and Sartre in particular became the leading public intellectuals of post-war France, achieving by the end of 1945 "a fame that reached across all audiences."&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Aronson, ''Camus and Sartre'' (University of Chicago Press, 2004, p. 44)&lt;/ref&gt; Camus was an editor of the most popular leftist (former [[French Resistance]]) newspaper ''[[Combat (newspaper)|Combat]]''; Sartre launched his journal of leftist thought, ''[[Les Temps Modernes]]'', and two weeks later gave the widely reported lecture on existentialism and [[secular humanism]] to a packed meeting of the Club Maintenant. Beauvoir wrote that "not a week passed without the newspapers discussing us";&lt;ref&gt;Simone de Beauvoir, ''Force of Circumstance'', quoted in Ronald Aronson, ''Camus and Sartre'' (University of Chicago Press, 2004, p. 48)&lt;/ref&gt; existentialism became "the first media craze of the postwar era."&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Aronson, ''Camus and Sartre'' (University of Chicago Press, 2004, p. 48)&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 1947, Camus' earlier fiction and plays had been reprinted, his new play ''[[Caligula (play)|Caligula]]'' had been performed and his novel ''[[The Plague]]'' published; the first two novels of Sartre's ''[[The Roads to Freedom]]'' trilogy had appeared, as had Beauvoir's novel ''[[The Blood of Others]]''. Works by Camus and Sartre were already appearing in foreign editions. The Paris-based existentialists had become famous.&lt;ref name="Ronald Aronson 2004"/&gt;

Sartre had traveled to Germany in 1930 to study the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[Martin Heidegger]],&lt;ref&gt;Rüdiger Safranski, ''Martin Heidgger – Between Good and Evil'' (Harvard University Press, 1998, p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; and he included critical comments on their work in his major treatise ''[[Being and Nothingness]]''. Heidegger's thought had also become known in French philosophical circles through its use by [[Alexandre Kojève]] in explicating Hegel in a series of lectures given in Paris in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Entry on Kojève in Martin Cohen (editor), ''The Essentials of Philosophy and Ethics''(Hodder Arnold, 2006, p. 158); see also Alexandre Kojève, ''Introduction to the Reading of Hegel: Lectures on the Phenomenology of Spirit'' (Cornell University Press, 1980)&lt;/ref&gt; The lectures were highly influential; members of the audience included not only Sartre and Merleau-Ponty, but [[Raymond Queneau]], [[Georges Bataille]], [[Louis Althusser]], [[André Breton]], and [[Jacques Lacan]].&lt;ref&gt;Entry on Kojève in Martin Cohen (editor), ''The Essentials of Philosophy and Ethics''(Hodder Arnold, 2006, p. 158)&lt;/ref&gt; A selection from Heidegger's ''[[Being and Time]]'' was published in French in 1938, and his essays began to appear in French philosophy journals.
[[File:Albert Camus, gagnant de prix Nobel, portrait en buste, posé au bureau, faisant face à gauche, cigarette de tabagisme.jpg|thumb|upright|French-Algerian philosopher, novelist, and playwright [[Albert Camus]]]]

Heidegger read Sartre's work and was initially impressed, commenting: "Here for the first time I encountered an independent thinker who, from the foundations up, has experienced the area out of which I think. Your work shows such an immediate comprehension of my philosophy as I have never before encountered."&lt;ref&gt;Martin Hediegger, letter, quoted in Rüdiger Safranski, ''Martin Heidgger – Between Good and Evil'' (Harvard University Press, 1998, p. 349)&lt;/ref&gt; Later, however, in response to a question posed by his French follower [[Jean Beaufret]],&lt;ref&gt;Rüdiger Safranski, ''Martin Heidegger – Between Good and Evil'' (Harvard University Press, 1998, p. 356)&lt;/ref&gt; Heidegger distanced himself from Sartre's position and existentialism in general in his ''[[Letter on Humanism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;William J. Richardson, ''Martin Heidegger: From Phenomenology to Thought'' (Martjinus Nijhoff,1967, p. 351)&lt;/ref&gt; Heidegger's reputation continued to grow in France during the 1950s and 1960s. In the 1960s, Sartre attempted to reconcile existentialism and [[Marxism]] in his work ''[[Critique of Dialectical Reason]]''. A major theme throughout his writings was freedom and responsibility.

Camus was a friend of Sartre, until their falling-out, and wrote several works with existential themes including ''[[The Rebel (book)|The Rebel]]'', ''Summer in Algiers'', ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]'', and ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]'', the latter being "considered—to what would have been Camus's irritation—the exemplary existentialist novel."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last = Messud |first = Claire |authorlink = Claire Messud |year = 2014 |title = A New 'L'Étranger' |url = http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2014/jun/05/camus-new-letranger/ |journal = [[The New York Review of Books]] |volume = 61 |number = 10 |accessdate = 1 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Camus, like many others, rejected the existentialist label, and considered his works concerned with facing the absurd. In the titular book, Camus uses the analogy of the Greek myth of [[Sisyphus]] to demonstrate the futility of existence. In the myth, Sisyphus is condemned for eternity to roll a rock up a hill, but when he reaches the summit, the rock will roll to the bottom again. Camus believes that this existence is pointless but that Sisyphus ultimately finds meaning and purpose in his task, simply by continually applying himself to it. The first half of the book contains an extended rebuttal of what Camus took to be existentialist philosophy in the works of Kierkegaard, Shestov, Heidegger, and Jaspers.

[[Simone de Beauvoir]], an important existentialist who spent much of her life as Sartre's partner, wrote about feminist and existentialist ethics in her works, including ''[[The Second Sex]]'' and ''[[The Ethics of Ambiguity]]''. Although often overlooked due to her relationship with Sartre,&lt;ref name = Bergoffen-SEoP&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/beauvoir/|title=Simone de Beauvoir|encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |author=Bergoffen, Debra|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; de Beauvoir integrated existentialism with other forms of thinking such as feminism, unheard of at the time, resulting in alienation from fellow writers such as Camus.&lt;ref name="Rukhsana"/&gt;

[[Paul Tillich]], an important existentialist theologian following Kierkegaard and [[Karl Barth]], applied existentialist concepts to [[Christian theology]], and helped introduce [[neo-orthodoxy|existential theology]] to the general public. His seminal work ''The Courage to Be'' follows Kierkegaard's analysis of anxiety and life's absurdity, but puts forward the thesis that modern humans must, via God, achieve selfhood in spite of life's absurdity. [[Rudolf Bultmann]] used Kierkegaard's and Heidegger's philosophy of existence to demythologize Christianity by interpreting Christian mythical concepts into existentialist concepts.

[[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], an [[Existential phenomenology|existential phenomenologist]], was for a time a companion of Sartre. Merleau-Ponty's ''[[Phenomenology of Perception]]'' (1945) was recognized as a major statement of French existentialism.&lt;ref&gt;Madison, G. B., in Robert Audi's ''The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999) [p. 559]&lt;/ref&gt; It has been said that Merleau-Ponty's work ''Humanism and Terror'' greatly influenced Sartre. However, in later years they were to disagree irreparably, dividing many existentialists such as de Beauvoir,&lt;ref name="Rukhsana"/&gt; who sided with Sartre.

[[Colin Wilson]], an English writer, published his study ''[[The Outsider (Colin Wilson)|The Outsider]]'' in 1956, initially to critical acclaim. In this book and others (e.g. ''Introduction to the New Existentialism''), he attempted to reinvigorate what he perceived as a pessimistic philosophy and bring it to a wider audience. He was not, however, academically trained, and his work was attacked by professional philosophers for lack of rigor and critical standards.&lt;ref&gt;K. Gunnar Bergström, ''An Odyssey to Freedom'' University of Uppsala, 1983, p. 92. Colin Stanley, ''Colin Wilson, a Celebration: Essays and Recollections'' Cecil Woolf, 1988, p. 43)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Film and television ====
[[Stanley Kubrick]]'s 1957 [[anti-war film]] ''[[Paths of Glory]]'' "illustrates, and even illuminates...existentialism" by examining the "necessary absurdity of the [[human condition]]" and the "horror of war".&lt;ref name=Holt2007&gt;Holt, Jason. "Existential Ethics: Where do the Paths of Glory Lead?". In ''The Philosophy of Stanley Kubr''ick. By Jerold J. Abrams. Published 2007. University Press of Kentucky. SBN 0-8131-2445-X&lt;/ref&gt; The film tells the story of a fictional World War I French army regiment ordered to attack an impregnable German stronghold; when the attack fails, three soldiers are chosen at random, court-martialed by a "[[kangaroo court]]", and executed by firing squad. The film examines existentialist ethics, such as the issue of whether [[objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]] is possible and the "problem of [[Authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]]".&lt;ref name=Holt2007/&gt; [[Orson Welles]]' 1962 film '' [[The Trial (1962 film)|The Trial]]'', based upon Franz Kafka's book of the same name (Der Process), is characteristic of both existentialist and absurdist themes in its depiction of a man (Joseph K.) arrested for a crime for which the charges are neither revealed to him nor to the reader.

''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion (anime)|Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'' is a Japanese [[science fiction]] animation series created by the [[anime]] studio [[Gainax]] and was both directed and written by [[Hideaki Anno]]. Existential themes of individuality, consciousness, freedom, choice, and responsibility are heavily relied upon throughout the entire series, particularly through the philosophies of [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Søren Kierkegaard]]. Episode 16's title, {{Nihongo|"The Sickness Unto Death, And..."|死に至る病、そして|Shi ni itaru yamai, soshite}} is a reference to Kierkegaard's book, ''[[The Sickness Unto Death]]''. Some contemporary films dealing with existentialist issues include [[Melancholia (2011 film)|''Melancholia'']],  ''[[Fight Club]]'', ''[[I Heart Huckabees]]'', ''[[Waking Life]]'', ''[[The Matrix]]'', ''[[Ordinary People]]'', and ''[[Life in a Day (2011 film)|Life in a Day]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.existential-therapy.com/Arts/Movies.htm |title=Existential &amp; Psychological Movie Recommendations |publisher=Existential-therapy.com |accessdate=2010-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107010239/http://www.existential-therapy.com/Arts/Movies.htm |archivedate=2010-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, films throughout the 20th century such as ''[[The Seventh Seal]]'', ''[[Ikiru]]'', ''[[Taxi Driver]]'', the [[Toy Story (franchise)|''Toy Story'' films]], ''[[The Great Silence]]'', ''[[Ghost in the Shell (1995 film)|Ghost in the Shell]]'', ''[[Harold and Maude]]'', ''[[High Noon]]'', ''[[Easy Rider]]'', ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'', ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'', ''[[Groundhog Day (film)|Groundhog Day]]'', ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'', ''[[Badlands (film)|Badlands]]'', and ''[[Blade Runner]]'' also have existentialist qualities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uhaweb.hartford.edu/BEAUCHEMI/ |title=Existentialism in Film |publisher=Uhaweb.hartford.edu |accessdate=2010-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This, in turn, leads him to a better understanding of humanity. The French film, ''[[Mood Indigo (film)|Mood Indigo]]'' (directed by [[Michel Gondry]]) embraced various elements of existentialism.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The film ''[[The Shawshank Redemption]]'', released in 1994, depicts life in a prison in [[Maine]], United States to explore several existentialist concepts.&lt;ref&gt;For an examination of the existentialist elements within the film, see [[Philosophy Now]], issue 102, accessible [http://philosophynow.org/issues/102/The_Shawshank_Redemption here (link)], accessed 3 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Literature ====
Existential perspectives are also found in modern literature to varying degrees, especially since the 1920s. [[Louis-Ferdinand Céline]]'s ''[[Journey to the End of the Night]]'' (Voyage au bout de la nuit, 1932) celebrated by both Sartre and Beauvoir, contained many of the themes that would be found in later existential literature, and is in some ways, the proto-existential novel. Jean-Paul Sartre's 1938 novel ''[[Nausea (novel)|Nausea]]''&lt;ref name=SartreNausea&gt;{{Cite journal| first= Jean-Paul| last= Sartre| translator-last=Baldick |translator-first=Robert |translator-link=Robert Baldick | title= Nausea| place= London| publisher= Penguin| year= 2000 |orig-year=1938 | page= | isbn=| postscript= &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; was "steeped in Existential ideas", and is considered an accessible way of grasping his philosophical stance.&lt;ref name=Earnshaw2006&gt;{{Cite book| first= Steven| last= Earnshaw| author-link=| title = Existentialism: A Guide for the Perplexed| place= London| publisher= Continuum| year= 2006| page= 75| isbn= 0-8264-8530-8| postscript= &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1900 and 1960, other authors such as [[Albert Camus]], [[Franz Kafka]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], [[T.S.

The philosophy's influence even reached pulp literature shortly after the turn of the 20th century, as seen in the existential disparity witnessed in Man's lack of control of his fate in the works of [[H.P. Lovecraft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.horrorreview.com/essay/eglovecraft12008.html |title=Zarathustra . . . Cthulhu . Meursault:  Existential Futility in H.P.

Books such as ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'' (1968) (now republished as ''[[Blade Runner]]'') by [[Philip K. Dick]], ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]'' by [[Kurt Vonnegut]],  ''[[Fight Club (novel)|Fight Club]]'' by [[Chuck Palahniuk]] and ''[https://www.writersworkshopindia.com/books/fiction/novel/formless-meanderings/ Formless Meanderings]'' by [[Bharath Srinivasan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Bharath|last=Srinivasan|title= Formless Meanderings|place= Kolkata|publisher= Writers Workshop|url=https://www.writersworkshopindia.com/books/fiction/novel/formless-meanderings/| year= 2009 |pages= 352| isbn=81-8157-945-4|ignore-isbn-error=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; all distort the line between reality and appearance while simultaneously espousing existential themes.

==== Theatre ====
[[Jean-Paul Sartre]] wrote ''[[No Exit]]'' in 1944, an existentialist [[play (theatre)|play]] originally published in French as ''Huis Clos'' (meaning ''[[wikt:in camera|In Camera]]'' or "behind closed doors"), which is the source of the popular quote, "Hell is other people." (In French, "L'enfer, c'est les autres"). The play begins with a Valet leading a man into a room that the audience soon realizes is in hell. Eventually he is joined by two women. After their entry, the Valet leaves and the door is shut and locked. All three expect to be tortured, but no torturer arrives. Instead, they realize they are there to torture each other, which they do effectively by probing each other's sins, desires, and unpleasant memories.

Existentialist themes are displayed in the [[Theatre of the Absurd]], notably in [[Samuel Beckett]]'s ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'', in which two men divert themselves while they wait expectantly for someone (or something) named Godot who never arrives. They claim Godot is an acquaintance, but in fact, hardly know him, admitting they would not recognize him if they saw him. Samuel Beckett, once asked who or what Godot is, replied, "If I knew, I would have said so in the play." To occupy themselves, the men eat, sleep, talk, argue, sing, play games, [[Physical exercise|exercise]], swap hats, and contemplate [[suicide]]—anything "to hold the terrible silence at bay".&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 31 December 1964. Quoted in Knowlson, J., ''Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Bloomsbury, 1996), p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; The play "exploits several archetypal forms and situations, all of which lend themselves to both comedy and [[pathos]]."&lt;ref&gt;Cronin, A., ''Samuel Beckett The Last Modernist'' (London: Flamingo, 1997), p. 391&lt;/ref&gt; The play also illustrates an attitude toward human experience on earth: the poignancy, oppression, camaraderie, hope, corruption, and bewilderment of human experience that can be reconciled only in the mind and art of the absurdist. The play examines questions such as death, the [[Meaning of life (philosophy)#Existentialism|meaning of human existence]] and the place of God in human existence.

[[Tom Stoppard]]'s ''[[Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead]]'' is an [[Theatre of the Absurd|absurdist]] [[tragicomedy]] first staged at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] in 1966.&lt;ref name="Chrono"&gt;{{cite web | author= Michael H. Hutchins | title=A Tom Stoppard Bibliography: Chronology | work=The Stephen Sondheim Reference Guide | url=http://www.sondheimguide.com/Stoppard/chronology.html | date=14 August 2006 | accessdate=2008-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play expands upon the exploits of two minor characters from [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[Hamlet]]''. Comparisons have also been drawn to [[Samuel Beckett]]'s ''[[Waiting For Godot]]'', for the presence of two central characters who appear almost as two halves of a single character. Many plot features are similar as well: the characters pass time by playing [[Questions (game)|Questions]], impersonating other characters, and interrupting each other or remaining silent for long periods of time. The two characters are portrayed as two clowns or fools in a world beyond their understanding. They stumble through philosophical arguments while not realizing the implications, and muse on the irrationality and randomness of the world.

[[Jean Anouilh]]'s ''[[Antigone (Anouilh play)|Antigone]]'' also presents arguments founded on existentialist ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wren|first=Celia |date= 12 December 2007 |title= From Forum, an Earnest and Painstaking 'Antigone' |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/11/AR2007121102254.html |publisher=Washington Post |accessdate=2008-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a tragedy inspired by Greek mythology and the play of the same name (Antigone, by Sophocles) from the 5th century BC. In English, it is often distinguished from its antecedent by being pronounced in its original French form, approximately "Ante-GŌN." The play was first performed in Paris on 6 February 1944, during the Nazi occupation of France. Produced under Nazi censorship, the play is purposefully ambiguous with regards to the rejection of authority (represented by Antigone) and the acceptance of it (represented by Creon). The parallels to the French Resistance and the Nazi occupation have been drawn. Antigone rejects life as desperately meaningless but without affirmatively choosing a noble death. The crux of the play is the lengthy dialogue concerning the nature of power, fate, and choice, during which Antigone says that she is, "...&amp;nbsp;disgusted with [the]...promise of a humdrum happiness." She states that she would rather die than live a mediocre existence.

Critic [[Martin Esslin]] in his book ''Theatre of the Absurd'' pointed out how many contemporary playwrights such as [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Eugène Ionesco]], [[Jean Genet]], and [[Arthur Adamov]] wove into their plays the existentialist belief that we are absurd beings loose in a universe empty of real meaning. Esslin noted that many of these playwrights demonstrated the philosophy better than did the plays by Sartre and Camus. Though most of such playwrights, subsequently labeled "Absurdist" (based on Esslin's book), denied affiliations with existentialism and were often staunchly anti-philosophical (for example Ionesco often claimed he identified more with [['Pataphysics]] or with [[Surrealism]] than with existentialism), the playwrights are often linked to existentialism based on Esslin's observation.&lt;ref&gt;Kernan, Alvin B. ''The Modern American Theater: A Collection of Critical Essays''. Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: [[Prentice-Hall]], 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychoanalysis and psychotherapy ===
{{Main|Existential therapy}}

A major offshoot of existentialism as a philosophy is existentialist psychology and psychoanalysis, which first crystallized in the work of [[Otto Rank]], Freud's closest associate for 20 years. Without awareness of the writings of Rank, [[Ludwig Binswanger]] was influenced by [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], [[Edmund Husserl]], [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]], and [[Jean-Paul Sartre|Sartre]]. A later figure was [[Viktor Frankl]], who briefly met [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] as a young man.&lt;ref&gt;[Frankl, Viktor: Recollections: An Autobiography. Perseus Publishing, Massachusetts 2000, p. 51]&lt;/ref&gt; His [[logotherapy]] can be regarded as a form of existentialist therapy. The existentialists would also influence [[social psychology]], antipositivist micro-[[sociology]], [[symbolic interactionism]], and [[post-structuralism]], with the work of thinkers such as [[Georg Simmel]]&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Jon. ''Kierkegaard and Existentialism''. p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Michel Foucault]]. Foucault was a great reader of Kierkegaard even though he almost never refers this author, who nonetheless had for him an importance as secret as it was decisive.&lt;ref&gt;Flynn, Thomas R. ''Sartre, Foucault, and Historical Reason'', p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt;

An early contributor to existentialist psychology in the United States was [[Rollo May]], who was strongly influenced by [[Kierkegaard]] and [[Otto Rank]]. One of the most prolific writers on techniques and theory of existentialist psychology in the USA is [[Irvin D. Yalom]]. Yalom states that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Aside from their reaction against Freud's mechanistic, deterministic model of the mind and their assumption of a phenomenological approach in therapy, the existentialist analysts have little in common and have never been regarded as a cohesive ideological school. These thinkers—who include Ludwig Binswanger, [[Medard Boss]], [[Eugène Minkowski]], V.E. Gebsattel, Roland Kuhn, G. Caruso, F.T. Buytendijk, G. Bally and Victor Frankl—were almost entirely unknown to the American psychotherapeutic community until Rollo May's highly influential 1985 book ''Existence''—and especially his introductory essay—introduced their work into this country.&lt;ref name=Yalom1980&gt;{{Cite book| first= Irvin D.| last= Yalom| author-link= Irvin D. Yalom| title = Existential Psychotherapy| place= New York| publisher= BasicBooks (Subsidiary of Perseus Books, L.L.C.| year= 1980| page= 17| isbn= 0-465-02147-6| postscript= &lt;!--None--&gt;}} Note: The copyright year has not changed, but the book remains in print.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
A more recent contributor to the development of a European version of existentialist psychotherapy is the British-based [[Emmy van Deurzen]].

Anxiety's importance in existentialism makes it a popular topic in [[psychotherapy]]. Therapists often offer existentialist [[philosophy]] as an explanation for anxiety. The assertion is that anxiety is manifested of an individual's complete freedom to decide, and complete responsibility for the outcome of such decisions. Psychotherapists using an existentialist approach believe that a patient can harness his anxiety and use it constructively. Instead of suppressing anxiety, patients are advised to use it as grounds for change. By embracing anxiety as inevitable, a person can use it to achieve his full potential in life. [[Humanistic psychology]] also had major impetus from existentialist psychology and shares many of the fundamental tenets. [[Terror management theory]], based on the writings of [[Ernest Becker]] and [[Otto Rank]], is a developing area of study within the academic study of psychology. It looks at what researchers claim are implicit emotional reactions of people confronted with the knowledge that they will eventually die.

Also, [[Gerd B. Achenbach]] has refreshed the Socratic tradition with his own blend of [[philosophical counseling]]. So did [[Michel Weber]] with his Chromatiques Center in Belgium.

== Criticisms ==

=== General criticisms ===

[[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] criticized 'the profoundly unsound methods and the dangerous contempt for reason that have been so prominent in existentialism.'&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann, Walter Arnold, From Shakespeare To Existentialism (Princeton University Press 1979), p. xvi&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Logical positivists|Logical positivist]] philosophers, such as [[Rudolf Carnap]] and [[A. J. Ayer]], assert that existentialists are often confused about the verb "to be" in their analyses of "being".&lt;ref name="Carnap, Rudolf 1932 pp. 219"&gt;Carnap, Rudolf, ''Uberwindung der Metaphysik durch logische Analyse der Sprache'' [''Overcoming Metaphysics by the Logical Analysis of Speech''], Erkenntnis (1932), pp. 219–41. Carnap's critique of Heidegger's "What is Metaphysics".
&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, they argue that the verb "is" is transitive and pre-fixed to a [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] (e.g., an apple ''is red'') (without a predicate, the word "is" is meaningless), and that existentialists frequently misuse the term in this manner. [[Colin Wilson]] has stated in his book ''The Angry Years'' that existentialism has created many of its own difficulties: "we can see how this question of freedom of the will has been vitiated by post-romantic philosophy, with its inbuilt tendency to laziness and [[boredom]], we can also see how it came about that existentialism found itself in a hole of its own digging, and how the philosophical developments since then have amounted to walking in circles round that hole".&lt;ref&gt;Colin, Wilson, ''The Angry Years'' (2007), p. 214&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sartre's philosophy===
Many critics argue [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s philosophy is contradictory. Specifically, they argue that Sartre makes metaphysical arguments despite his claiming that his philosophical views ignore metaphysics. [[Herbert Marcuse]] criticized Sartre's 1943 ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'' for projecting anxiety and meaninglessness onto the nature of existence itself: "Insofar as Existentialism is a philosophical doctrine, it remains an idealistic doctrine: it [[hypostatic abstraction|hypostatizes]] specific historical conditions of human existence into ontological and metaphysical characteristics. Existentialism thus becomes part of the very ideology which it attacks, and its radicalism is illusory".&lt;ref name=Marcuse1972&gt;Marcuse, Herbert. "Sartre's Existentialism". Printed in ''Studies in Critical Philosophy''. Translated by Joris De Bres. London: NLB, 1972. p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Letter on Humanism'', [[Martin Heidegger]] criticized Sartre's existentialism:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Existentialism says existence precedes essence. In this statement he is taking ''existentia'' and ''essentia'' according to their metaphysical meaning, which, from Plato's time on, has said that ''essentia'' precedes ''existentia''. Sartre reverses this statement. But the reversal of a metaphysical statement remains a metaphysical statement. With it, he stays with metaphysics, in oblivion of the truth of Being.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, "Letter on Humanism", in ''Basic Writings: Nine Key Essays, plus the Introduction to ''Being and Time'' '', trans. David Farrell Krell (London, Routledge; 1978), p. 208. [https://books.google.com/books?id=kVc9AAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA208&amp;dq=But%20the%20reversal%20of%20a%20metaphysical%20statement%20remains%20a%20metaphysical%20statement.%20With%20it%2C%20he%20stays%20with%20metaphysics%2C%20in%20oblivion%20of%20the%20truth%20of%20Being.&amp;pg=PA208#v=onepage&amp;q=But%20the%20reversal%20of%20a%20metaphysical%20statement%20remains%20a%20metaphysical%20statement.%20With%20it,%20he%20stays%20with%20metaphysics,%20in%20oblivion%20of%20the%20truth%20of%20Being.

'''Flocking''' behavior is the behavior exhibited when a group of birds, called a [[Flock (birds)|flock]], are [[foraging]] or in flight. There are parallels with the [[Shoaling and schooling|shoaling]] behavior of fish, the [[swarm]]ing behavior of insects, and [[herd behavior]] of land animals.

Computer simulations and mathematical models which have been developed to emulate the flocking behaviors of birds can generally be applied also to the "flocking" behavior of other species. As a result, the term "flocking" is sometimes applied, in computer science, to species other than birds.

This article is about the modelling of flocking behavior. From the perspective of the mathematical modeller, "flocking" is the collective motion of a large number of self-propelled entities and is a [[collective animal behavior]] exhibited by many living beings such as [[flock (birds)|bird]]s, [[fish]], [[bacteria]], and  [[insect]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= O'Loan |first= OJ |last2= Evans |first2= MR |year= 1999|title= Alternating steady state in one-dimensional flocking |url= https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0305-4470/32/8/002/meta |journal= Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and General |publisher= IOP Publishing |volume= 32 |issue= 8 |pages= L99 |doi= 10.1088/0305-4470/32/8/002|arxiv = cond-mat/9811336|bibcode= 1999JPhA...32L..99O }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered an [[emergence|emergent]] behavior arising from simple rules that are followed by individuals and does not involve any central coordination.

Flocking behavior was simulated on a computer in 1987 by [[Craig Reynolds (computer graphics)|Craig Reynolds]] with his simulation program, [[Boids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference
|author= Reynolds, Craig W.
|title= Flocks, herds and schools: A distributed behavioral model.
|booktitle= ACM SIGGRAPH Computer Graphics
|volume=21 |issue=4 |pages= 25–34
|year=1987
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This program simulates simple agents (boids) that are allowed to move according to a set of basic rules. The result is akin to a [[Flock (birds)|flock]] of [[bird]]s, a [[Shoaling and schooling|school]] of [[fish]], or a [[swarm]] of [[insects]].

==Flocking rules==

Basic models of flocking behavior are controlled by three simple rules:

#Separation - avoid crowding neighbours (short range repulsion)
#Alignment - steer towards average heading of neighbours
#Cohesion - steer towards average position of neighbours (long range attraction)

With these three simple rules, the flock moves in an extremely realistic way, creating complex motion and interaction that would be extremely hard to create otherwise.

The basic model has been extended in several different ways since Reynolds proposed it. For instance, Delgado-Mata et al.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|vauthors=Delgado-Mata C, Ibanez J, Bee S|display-authors=etal |title= On the use of Virtual Animals with Artificial Fear in Virtual Environments

|year=2007
|doi= 10.1007/s00354-007-0009-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
extended the basic model to incorporate the effects of fear. Olfaction was used to transmit emotion between animals, through pheromones modelled as particles in a free expansion gas. Hartman and Benes

introduced a complementary force to the alignment that they call the change of leadership. This steer defines the chance of the bird to become a leader and try to escape.
Hemelrijk and Hildenbrandt
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|author1=Hemelrijk, C. K. |author2=Hildenbrandt, H. |title= Some Causes of the Variable Shape of Flocks of Birds
|journal=PLOS ONE
|volume=6 |issue=8 |year=2011
|doi= 10.1371/journal.pone.0022479 |pages=e22479 |pmid=21829627 |pmc=3150374|bibcode=2011PLoSO...622479H}}&lt;/ref&gt;
used attraction, alignment and avoidance and extended this with a number of traits of real starlings: first, birds fly according to fixed wing aerodynamics, while rolling when turning (thus losing lift); second, they coordinate with a limited number of interaction neighbours of 7 (like real starlings); third, they try to stay above a sleeping site (like starlings do at dawn), and when they happen to move outwards from the sleeping site, they return to it by turning; fourth, they move at relative fixed speed. The authors showed that the specifics of flying behaviour as well as large flocksize and low number of interaction partners were essential to the creation of the variable shape of flocks of starlings.

== Measurement ==
Measurements of bird flocking have been made&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | last =Feder | first =Toni |date=October 2007 | title =Statistical physics is for the birds | journal = Physics Today| volume =60 | issue =10 | pages =28–30 | id = | url = | accessdate = | doi =10.1063/1.2800090 }}&lt;/ref&gt; using high-speed cameras, and a computer analysis has been made to test the simple rules of flocking mentioned above. It is found that they generally hold true in the case of bird flocking, but the long range attraction rule (cohesion) applies to the nearest 5-10 neighbors of the flocking bird and is independent of the distance of these neighbors from the bird. In addition, there is an [[anisotropy]] with regard to this cohesive tendency, with more cohesion being exhibited towards neighbors to the sides of the bird, rather than in front or behind. This is no doubt due to the field of vision of the flying bird being directed to the sides rather than directly forward or backward.

Another recent study is based on an analysis of high speed camera footage of flocks above Rome, and uses a computer model assuming minimal behavioural rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hildenbrandt | first1 = H | last2 = Carere | first2 = C | last3 = Hemelrijk | first3 = CK | year = 2010 | title = Self-organized aerial displays of thousands of starlings: a model | url = http://beheco.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/6/1349.full | journal = Behavioral Ecology | volume = 21 | issue = 6| pages = 1349–1359 | doi = 10.1093/beheco/arq149 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hemelrijk | first1 = CK | last2 = Hildenbrandt | first2 = H | year = 2011 | title = Some causes of the variable shape of flocks of birds | url = http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0022479 | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 6 | issue = 8| page = e22479 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0022479 | pmid=21829627 | pmc=3150374| bibcode = 2011PLoSO...622479H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rug.nl/sciencelinx/exhibits/swarming/index Project Starflag]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rug.nl/fmns-research/beso/_people/hemelrijk Swarm behaviour model by University of Groningen]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Algorithmic complexity==
In flocking simulations, there is no central control; each bird behaves autonomously. In other words, each bird has to decide for itself which flocks to consider as its environment. Usually environment is defined as a circle (2D) or sphere (3D) with a certain radius (representing reach).{{cn|date=March 2018}}

A basic implementation of a flocking algorithm has complexity &lt;math&gt;O(n^2)&lt;/math&gt; - each bird searches through all other birds to find those which fall into its environment.{{synthesis-inline|date=March 2018}}

Possible improvements:{{cn|date=March 2018}}
* bin-[[Square lattice|lattice]] spatial subdivision. Entire area the flock can move in is divided into a large number of bins. Each bin stores which birds it contains. Each time a bird moves from one bin to another, lattice has to be updated.
** Example: 2D(3D) grid in a 2D(3D) flocking simulation.
** Complexity: &lt;math&gt;O(n k)&lt;/math&gt;, k is number of surrounding bins to consider; just when bird's bin is found in &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt;

Lee Spector, Jon Klein, Chris Perry and [[Mark Feinstein]] studied the emergence of collective behavior in evolutionary computation systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hampshire.edu/lspector/gecco2003-collective.html | author=Spector, L. |author2=Klein, J. |author3=Perry, C. |author4= Feinstein, M.  | year=2003 | title=Emergence of Collective Behavior in Evolving Populations of Flying Agents | work=Proceedings of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO-2003) | publisher=Springer-Verlag | accessdate=2007-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bernard Chazelle]] proved that under the assumption that each bird adjusts its velocity and position to the other birds within a fixed radius, the time it takes to converge to a steady state is an iterated exponential of height logarithmic in the number of birds. This means that if the number of birds is large enough, the convergence time will be so great that it might as well be infinite.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Chazelle, ''The Convergence of Bird Flocking'', J. ACM 61 (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; This result applies only to convergence to a steady state. For example, arrows fired into the air at the edge of a flock will cause the whole flock to react more rapidly than can be explained by interactions with neighbors, which are slowed down by the time delay in the bird's central nervous systems—bird-to-bird-to-bird.

In Cologne, Germany, two biologists from the University of Leeds demonstrated a flock-like behavior in humans. The group of people exhibited a very similar behavioral pattern to that of a flock, where if 5% of the flock would change direction the others would follow suit. When one person was designated as a predator and everyone else was to avoid him, the flock behaved very much like a school of fish.&lt;ref&gt;"http://psychcentral.com/news/2008/02/15/herd-mentality-explained/1922.html". Retrieved on October 31st 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Flocking has also been considered as a means of controlling the behavior of Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs).&lt;ref&gt;Senanayake, M., Senthooran, I., Barca, J.

'''Frøy Aagre''' (born 8 June 1977 in [[Tønsberg]], [[Norway]]) is a [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] jazz musician (saxophone).&lt;ref name=discogs&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Fr%C3%B8y+Aagre |title=Frøy Aagre Discography |publisher=[[Discogs.com]] |accessdate=2013-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Aagre is one of the leading saxophonists of Norway, playing tenor and soprano saxophone with an individual sound that builds on inspirations by such saxophonists as [[Dave Liebman]] and [[Wayne Shorter]]. She has studied saxophone and composition in [[Oslo]], Birmingham, London, New York and [[Buenos Aires]]. Aagre was awarded the Norwegian Government scholarship for the year 2005/2006.&lt;ref name=wangarattajazz&gt;{{cite web |url=http://2013.wangarattajazz.com/artist/froy-aagre-electric-norway |title=Frøy Aagre Electric (Norway) |publisher=Wangarattajazz.com |date=3 November 2013 |accessdate=2013-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aagre released her first album ''Katalyze'' in 2004 with '''Frøy Aagre Offbeat''', including [[Andreas Ulvo]], [[Freddy Augdal]] and [[Roger Williamsen]], and attracted notice throughout Europe, and soon found herself invited to perform at major festivals in Europe, North America and India. There after followed ''Countryside'' (2006) and ''Cycle of Silence'' (2010) both receiving great reviews. When attending the Banff Jazz Workshop in Canada, in 2005, Aagre started a collaboration with the [[Brisbane]] band Misinterprotato (now known as Trichotomy). This led to touring with the trio, including an appearance at Wangaratta Jazz Festival in 2009.&lt;ref name=wangarattajazz/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mela.no/artister/froy-aagre |title=Frøy Aagre Biography |publisher=Mela.no |accessdate=2013-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Here is the liner notes for the latest album Frøy Aagre Electric: The name Frøy Aagre Electric refers to the new setup with Fender Rhodes Electric Piano, effects and bass synth as opposed to the previous setup of merely acoustic instruments.  This album is divided into two parts; following is a description of part 1, the main section of the album (track 1–6). Part 2 is the three duo pieces at the end (track 7–9).

Whilst the previous album, "Cycle of Silence" explored the use of silence in music, this album goes in the opposite direction, exploring energy, vitality, rhythmic drive and musical playfulness.
 
The focus during the compositional process, the rehearsal period, recording session and the mixing process was to create musical momentum; by making the music constantly move and flow between different sections and contrasting moods, creating tension and relief by using various instrumentations, electronic sounds and dynamics. The focus during the recording session itself was to capture the electric live energy in the studio.

Whereas previous albums have been acoustic, melodic jazz with occasional hints of classical and world music, my change of musical preferences and the entry of electronic sounds have added influence from pop and electronica to the music.
This album is groundbreaking and a game changer for me. Entering the world of electronic sounds has broadened my musical horizon and opened doors to new genres to mix and play with as part of my musical pallet, yet not being totally devoted to any.

I strive to maintain a balance between spontaneity and structure, bridging the gap between the composed and the improvised by making it part of the same overall form. As always I care a lot about the melodies, but this time in combination with a stronger focus on rhythmic drive. Choosing the right musicians for your music is important to make your music blossom and Andreas and Jonas have contributed tremendously to the musical expression of this album. I would also like to mention the wonderful guests who has lifted the music further and broadened the range of sounds.

The album itself is a journey, like snapshots of my life; "Berlin", composed in this thrilling city, one of my favourites in Europe and "City Lights" inspired by the urban pulse and uplifting energy of big capital cities. “Castle in the Air”, is written to Andreas Ulvo, my musical soul mate over the last 10 years, and was a tune that created spontaneous energetic moments in the recording studio.
“Birds, Bees and Forest Trees” is inspired by a particularly beautiful walk in the woods,  "Entanglement" is about the close relationships in life and the playful "African Wig", with African music influences recalls moments from my African tour.
The album ends in quiet contemplation with three duo pieces, of which Youth and Loss 77 is heavily influenced in the aftermath of the national tragedy of 22 July 2011.

This is the inspiration behind the compositions, but I hope you make the music your own and connect it to your life and experiences.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3421">'''Gametogamy'''  is sexual  fusion – copulation or fertlization – of two single-celled [[gamete]]s of different sex and the union of the their  [[gamete]] [[Cell nucleus|nuclei]] (and corresponding extranuclear structures)  giving the [[zygote]] nucleus, as well as whole zygotic content.&lt;ref&gt;Beukeboom, L. and Perrin, N.

According to its [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]], size and other properties, most forms of gametogamy are as follows:

*'''[[Isogamy]]''' ([[Ancient Greek]] ισο -  ''iso''= "equal  + γάμος ''gámos'' = "marriage") – in [[cell biology]] – is a type  of [[sexual reproduction]] that includes [[gamete]]s of similar morphological similar shape and size,  with difference  in general only in [[genom]] content and  [[gene expression]] in one or more [[mating-type region]]s. Both gametes look alike, and they cannot be classified as "[[male]]" or "[[female]]."  Actually, organisms characterized as  isogametic have different [[mating type]]s, most commonly noted as "+" and "&amp;minus;" strains, although in some species there are more than two mating types (designated by numbers or letters). Izogamic [[fertilization]] includes  two  gametes fusion, when  different mating types form a [[zygote]]. &lt;ref name="Campbell"&gt;{{cite book|author=Campbell  N. A.  et al.|year=2008|title=Biology. 8th Ed. |publisher=Person International Edition, San Francisco|isbn=978-0-321-53616-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Heterogamy]]''' ([[Ancient Greek]] ἕτερος ''heteros'' =  "other, another" + γάμος ''gámos'' = "marriage") – in [[cell biology]] – is a synonym  of [[anisogamy]], involving  differently sized male and female [[gamete]]s produced by different sexes or mating types in a [[species]].

*'''[[Apogamy]]'''  ([[Ancient Greek]] αρο - ''apo''  = from, of +  γάμος ''gámos'') – in [[botany]] –  is defined as a replacement of normal [[sexual reproduction]] by [[asexual reproduction | asexual propagation]], without [[fertilization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/46760#page/313/mode/1up|author=Winkler, H.|year=1908|title=Über Parthenogenesis und Apogamie im Pflanzenreich|volume=2|issue=3|journal=Progressus Rei Botanicae|pages=293–454}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fruits can be developed without [[fertilization]]. In this case, [[embryo]]  occurs without fertilization or without the presence of [[pollen]] . A special form of apogamia  is when the embryo  develops klijavo seed. It is the phenomenon called [[parthenogenesis]]. So, fruits contain seeds, which although not fertilized, maintaining viability. In this case the embryo or germ arises from unfertilized [[oocyte]]. This phenomenon is widespread example  in  [[nut (fruit)|nut]]s. 
From such seeds develop plants whose features are identical properties of  mothers from which  the seed was taken.

'''Gerontology'''  is the study of the [[social]], [[Culture|cultural]], [[Psychology|psychological]], [[cognitive]], and [[Biology|biological]] aspects of [[ageing]]. The word was coined by [[Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov]] in 1903, from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[wikt:γέρων|γέρων]], ''geron'', "old man" and -λογία, ''-logia'', "study of".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aghe.org/resources/gerontology-geriatrics-descriptions|title=Gerontology/Geriatrics Definitions|last=Confluence|website=www.aghe.org|access-date=2016-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field is distinguished from [[geriatrics]], which is the branch of medicine that specializes in the treatment of existing disease in older adults. Gerontologists include researchers and practitioners in the fields of biology, nursing, medicine, criminology, dentistry, social work, physical and occupational therapy, psychology, psychiatry, sociology, economics, political science, architecture, geography, pharmacy, public health, housing, and anthropology.&lt;ref name=Hooyman&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hooyman |first1=N.R. |last2=Kiyak |first2=H.A. |title=Social gerontology: A multidisciplinary perspective |publisher=Pearson Education |location=Boston |year=2011 |isbn=978-0205763139 |edition=9th }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The multidisciplinary nature of gerontology means that there are a number of sub-fields which overlap with gerontology. There are policy issues, for example, involved in government planning and the operation of nursing homes, investigating the effects of an [[Population ageing|ageing population]] on society, and the design of residential spaces for older people that facilitate the development of a sense of place or home. Dr. Lawton, a behavioral psychologist at the Philadelphia Geriatric Center, was among the first to recognize the need for living spaces designed to accommodate the elderly, especially those with Alzheimer's disease. As an academic discipline the field is relatively new. The USC Leonard Davis School created the first PhD, master's and bachelor's degree programs in gerontology in 1975.

==History==
In the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]], several physicians wrote on issues related to Gerontology. [[Avicenna]]'s ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]'' (1025) offered instruction for the care of the aged, including [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] and remedies for problems including [[constipation]].&lt;ref name=Howell87&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Howell|first=Trevor H.|title=Avicenna and His Regimen of Old Age|journal=Age and Ageing|year=1987|volume=16|pages=58–59|doi=10.1093/ageing/16.1.58|pmid=3551552|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arabic physician [[Ibn Al-Jazzar]] Al-Qayrawani (Algizar, c. 898–980) wrote on the aches and conditions of the elderly (Ammar 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;4).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ammar |first1= S |year= 1998 |title= Vesalius |journal= Official Journal of the International Society for the History of Medicine |volume= 4 |page= 48 |url= http://www.bium.univ-paris5.fr/ishm/vesalius/VESx1998x04x01.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; His scholarly work covers [[sleep disorder]]s, [[Forgetting|forgetfulness]], how to strengthen [[memory]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/arabic/bioI.html#jazzar |title=Ibn al-Jazzār, Abū Ja'far Ahmad ibn Ibrāhīm ibn Abī Khālid (d. 979/369) |work=Islamic Medical Manuscripts |publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine |accessdate=24 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[Geritt Bos, ''Ibn al-Jazzar'', ''Risala fi l-isyan'' (Treatise on forgetfulness), London, 1995 ]&lt;/ref&gt; and causes of [[Death|mortality]]&lt;ref name="Al Jazzar"&gt;[http://www.islam.org.br/al_jazzar.htm Al Jazzar] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706155736/http://www.islam.org.br/al_jazzar.htm |date=July 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ishaq ibn Hunayn]] (died 910) also wrote works on the treatments for forgetfulness (U.S. National Library of Medicine, 1994).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/islamic_medical/islamic_08.html |title=Specialized literature |work=Islamic culture and medical arts |publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine |accessdate=24 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the number of aged humans, and the [[life expectancy]], tended to increase in every century since the 14th, society tended to consider caring for an elderly relative as a family issue. It was not until the coming of the [[Industrial Revolution]] that ideas shifted in favor of a societal care-system. Some early pioneers, such as [[Michel Eugène Chevreul]], who himself lived to be 102, believed that aging itself should be a science to be studied. [[Élie Metchnikoff]] coined the term "gerontology" {{circa}} 1903.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=gerontology Online Etymology Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern pioneers like [[James Birren]] began organizing gerontology as its own field in the 1940s, later being involved in starting a US government agency on aging &amp;ndash; the [[National Institute on Aging]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the National Institute on Aging|url=https://www.nia.nih.gov/about|publisher=National Institute on Aging, US National Institutes of Health|accessdate=5 March 2018|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; programs in gerontology at the [[University of Southern California]] and [[University of California, Los Angeles]], and as past president of the [[Gerontological Society of America]] (founded in 1945).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Newcomb|first1=Beth|title=In memoriam: James E.

With the population of people over 60 years old expected to be some 22% of the world's population by 2050, assessment and treatment methods for age-related disease burden &amp;ndash; the term ''geroscience'' emerged in the early 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=4036419|year=2014|author1=Burch|first1=J.

==Aging demographics==
The world is forecast to undergo rapid [[aging population|population aging]] in the next several decades.  In 1900, there were 3.1 million people aged 65 years and older living in the [[United States]].  However, this population continued to grow throughout the 20th century and reached 31.2, 35, and 40.3 million people in 1990, 2000, and 2010, respectively.  Notably, in the United States and across the world, the [[Baby boomers|"baby boomer"]] generation began to turn 65 in 2011.  Recently, the population aged 65 years and older has grown at a faster rate than the total population in the United States.  The total population increased by 9.7%, from 281.4 million to 308.7 million, between 2000 and 2010.  However, the population aged 65 years and older increased by 15.1% during the same period.&lt;ref name="census.gov"&gt;{{cite web |author=Carrie A. Werner |title=The Older Population: 2010 |year=2010 |work=2010 Census Briefs |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-09.pdf |id=C2010BR-09 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been estimated that 25% of the population in the United States and [[Canada]] will be aged 65 years and older by 2025.  Moreover, by 2050, it is predicted that, for the first time in United States history, the number of individuals aged 60 years and older will be greater than the number of children aged 0 to 14 years.&lt;ref name= Taylor /&gt;  Those aged 85 years and older (oldest-old) are projected to increase from 5.3 million to 21 million by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Population |chapterurl=http://www.agingstats.gov/agingstatsdotnet/Main_Site/Data/2008_Documents/Population.aspx |title=2008 Older Americans : Key indicators of Well-Being |year=2008 |url=http://www.agingstats.gov/agingstatsdotnet/Main_Site/Data/Data_2008.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Adults aged 85–89 years constituted the greatest segment of the oldest-old in 1990, 2000, and 2010.  However, the largest percentage point increase among the oldest-old occurred in the 90- to 94-year-old age group, which increased from 25.0% in 1990 to 26.4% in 2010.&lt;ref name="census.gov"/&gt;

With the rapid growth of the aging population, social work education and training specialized in older adults and practitioners interested in working with older adults are increasingly in demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Institute for Geriatric Social Work |publisher=Boston University |url=http://www.bu.edu/igsw/who-we-are/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100711073154/http://www.bu.edu/igsw/who-we-are/ |archivedate=2010-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Geriatric Social Work Initiative |url=http://www.gswi.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender differences with age ===

There has been a considerable disparity between the number of men and women in the older population in the United States.  In both 2000 and 2010, women outnumbered men in the older population at every single year of age (e.g., 65 to 100 years and over).  The [[sex ratio]], which is a measure used to indicate the balance of males to females in a population, is calculated by taking the number of males divided by the number of females, and multiplying by 100. Therefore, the sex ratio is the number of males per 100 females.  In 2010, there were 90.5 males per 100 females in the 65-year-old population.  However, this represented an increase from 1990 when there were 82.7 males per 100 females, and from 2000 when the sex ratio was 88.1. Although the gender gap between men and women has narrowed, women continue to have a greater life expectancy and lower mortality rates at older ages relative to men. For example, the [[2010 United States Census|Census 2010]] reported that there were approximately twice as many women as men living in the United States at 89 years of age (361,309 versus 176,689, respectively).&lt;ref name="census.gov"/&gt;

=== Geographic distribution of older adults ===
The number and percentage of older adults living in the United States vary across the four different regions (Northeast, Midwest, West, and South) defined by the United States census.  In 2010, the South contained the greatest number of people aged 65 years and older and 85 years and older.  However, proportionately, the Northeast contains the largest percentage of adults aged 65 years and older (14.1%), followed by the Midwest (13.5%), the South (13.0%), and the West (11.9%). Relative to the [[Census 2000]], all geographic regions demonstrated positive growth in the population of adults aged 65 years and older and 85 years and older. The most rapid growth in the population of adults aged 65 years and older was evident in the West (23.5%), which showed an increase from 6.9 million in 2000 to 8.5 million in 2010.  Likewise, in the population aged 85 years and older, the West (42.8%) also showed the fastest growth and increased from 806,000 in 2000 to 1.2 million in 2010. It is worth highlighting that [[Rhode Island]] was the only state that experienced a reduction in the number of people aged 65 years and older, and declined from 152,402 in 2000 to 151,881 in 2010.  Conversely, all states exhibited an increase in the population of adults aged 85 years and older from 2000 to 2010.&lt;ref name="census.gov"/&gt;

== Biogerontology ==
[[File:Altenpflege 02.jpg|thumb|The hand of an older adult]]
{{Main|Theories of aging}}
Biogerontology is the sub-field of gerontology concerned with the [[Senescence|biological aging process]], its evolutionary origins, and potential means to intervene in the process. It involves interdisciplinary research on biological aging's causes, effects, and mechanisms.  Conservative biogerontologists such as [[Leonard Hayflick]] have predicted that the human life expectancy will peak at about 92 years old,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Watts G |title=Leonard Hayflick and the limits of ageing |journal=Lancet |volume=377 |issue=9783 |page=2075 |date=June 2011 |pmid=21684371 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60908-2 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(11)60908-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others such as [[James Vaupel]] have predicted that in industrialized countries, life expectancies will reach 100 for children born after the year 2000.&lt;ref name=Christensen2009&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Christensen|first1=L|last2=Doblhammer|first2=K|last3=Rau|first3=G|last4=Vaupel|first4=JW|title=Ageing populations: the challenges ahead|journal=Lancet|date=2009|volume=374|issue=9696|pages=1196–1208|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(09)61460-4|pmid=19801098|pmc=2810516}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some surveyed biogerontologists have predicted life expectancies of two or more centuries.&lt;ref name=Richel2003&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richel|first1=Theo|title=Will human life expectancy quadruple in the next hundred years? Sixty gerontologists say public debate on life extension is necessary|journal=J Anti-Aging Med|date=December 2003|volume=6|issue=4|pages=309–314|doi=10.1089/109454503323028902|pmid=15142432}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Aubrey de Grey]] offering the "tentative timeframe" that with adequate funding of research to develop interventions in aging such as [[Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence]], "we have a 50/50 chance of developing technology within about 25 to 30 years from now that will, under reasonable assumptions about the rate of subsequent improvements in that technology, allow us to stop people from dying of aging at any age", leading to life expectancies of 1,000 years.&lt;ref name=deGreyRae2008&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Grey|first1=Aubrey D. N. J.|last2=Rae|first2=Michael|authorlink1=Aubrey de Grey|title=Ending Aging|date=October 14, 2008|publisher=St. Martin's Griffin|isbn=978-0312367077|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Biomedical gerontology]], also known as experimental gerontology and [[life extension]], is a sub-discipline of biogerontology that endeavors to slow, prevent, and even reverse aging in both humans and animals. Most "[[Anti-aging movement|life extensionists]]" believe the human life span can be increased within the next century, if not sooner. Biogerontologists vary in the degree to which they focus on the study of the aging process as a means of mitigating the [[age-related disease|diseases of aging]] or extending lifespan, although most agree that extension of lifespan will necessarily flow from reductions in age-related disease and frailty, although some argue that [[maximum life span]] cannot be altered or that it is undesirable to try. Geroscience is a recently formulated interdisciplinary field that embraces biomedical gerontology as the center of preventing [[age-related disease|diseases of aging]] through science.&lt;ref name="Lithgow2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lithgow|first1=Gordon J.|authorlink1=Gordon J. Lithgow|title=Origins of Geroscience|journal=Public Policy &amp; Aging Report|date=1 September 2013|volume=4|issue=1|pages=10–11|doi=10.1093/ppar/23.4.10|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast with biogerontology, which aims to prevent age-related disease by intervening in aging processes, geriatrics is a field of medicine that studies the treatment of existing disease in aging people.

There are numerous theories of aging, and no one theory has been accepted. There is a wide spectrum of the types of theories for the causes of aging with programmed theories on one extreme and error theories on the other. Regardless of the theory, a commonality is that as humans age, functions of the body decline.&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{cite book |first1=Albert W. |last1=Taylor |first2=Michel J. |last2=Johnson |title=Physiology of Exercise and Healthy Aging |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fcGtzfxkFhwC |year=2008 |publisher=Human Kinetics |isbn=978-0-7360-5838-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stochastic theories ===
Stochastic theories of aging is the suggestion that aging is caused by small changes in the body over time and the body's failure to restore the system and mend the damages to the body. The cells and tissues are eventually injured due to the damage gathered over time. This causes the diminishes in an organ's function related to age. The notion of accumulated damage was first introduced by Weisman as the "wear and tear" theory.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lipsky|first1=Martin S.|last2=King|first2=Mitch|title=Biological theories of aging|journal=Disease-a-Month|date=2015|volume=61|issue=11|pages=460–466|doi=10.1016/j.disamonth.2015.09.005|pmid=26490576|url=http://www.diseaseamonth.com/article/S0011-5029(15)00146-7/abstract|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wear and tear theory====

Wear and tear theories of aging suggest that as an individual ages, body parts such as cells and organs wear out from continued use. Wearing of the body can be attributable to internal or external causes that eventually lead to an accumulation of [[Insult (medical)|insults]] which surpasses the capacity for repair. Due to these internal and external insults, cells lose their ability to regenerate, which ultimately leads to mechanical and chemical exhaustion. Some insults include chemicals in the air, food, or smoke. Other insults may be things such as viruses, trauma, free radicals, cross-linking, and high body temperature.&lt;ref name="Taylor" /&gt;

==== Accumulation ====
Accumulation theories of aging suggest that aging is bodily decline that results from an accumulation of elements, whether introduced to the body from the environment or resulting from cell metabolism.&lt;ref name= Taylor /&gt; An example of an accumulation theory is the Free Radical Theory of Aging.

==== Free radical theory ====
[[Free radicals]] are reactive molecules produced by cellular and environmental processes, and can damage the elements of the cell such as the [[cell membrane]] and [[DNA]] and cause irreversible damage. The [[free-radical theory of aging]] proposes that this damage cumulatively degrades the biological function of cells and impacts the process of aging.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boniewska-Bernacka|first=Ewa|date=2016|title=Selected Theories of Ageing|url=https://depot.ceon.pl/bitstream/handle/123456789/11286/Boniewska.pdf?sequence=1|journal=Higher School's Pulse|volume=10|pages=36–39|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that free radicals are toxic agents was first proposed by Rebeca Gerschman and colleagues in 1945,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fenn|first=Rebecca|author2=Gilbert, DL, Nye, SW, Dwyer, P, and Fenn WO|title=Oxygen poisoning and x-irradiation: a mechanism in common|journal=Science|date=7 May 1954|volume=119|issue=3097|pages=623–626|pmid=13156638|bibcode=1954Sci...119..623G|doi=10.1126/science.119.3097.623 |last3=Nye|first3=Sylvanus W.|last4=Dwyer|first4=Peter|last5=Fenn|first5=Wallace O.}}&lt;/ref&gt; but came to prominence in 1956, when [[Denham Harman]] proposed the free-radical theory of aging and even demonstrated that free radical reactions contribute to the degradation of biological systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harman|first=D|title=The aging process|journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.|date=November 1981|volume=78|issue=11|pages=7124–7128|pmid=6947277 |pmc=349208|doi=10.1073/pnas.78.11.7124 |bibcode=1981PNAS...78.7124H}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oxidative damage of many types accumulate with age, such as oxidative stress that oxygen-free radicals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hagen|first=Bruce N|author2=MK Shigenaga |author3=TM Hagen |title=Oxidants, antioxidants, and the degenerative diseases of aging |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |date=September 1993 |volume=90 |issue=17|pages=7915–7922 |pmid=8367443|pmc=47258|bibcode=1993PNAS...90.7915A|doi=10.1073/pnas.90.17.7915 }}&lt;/ref&gt; because the free radical theory of aging argues that aging results from the damage generated by [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beckman|first=KB|author2=Ames BN|title=The free radial theory of aging matures|journal=Physiol Rev|date=April 1998|volume=78|issue=2|pages=547–581|pmid=9562038 |doi=10.1152/physrev.1998.78.2.547}}&lt;/ref&gt; ROS are small, highly reactive, oxygen-containing molecules that can damage a complex of cellular components such as fat, proteins, or from DNA, they are naturally generated in small amounts during the body's metabolic reactions. These conditions become more common as humans grow older and include diseases related to aging, such as dementia, cancer and heart disease.

==== DNA damage theory ====

DNA damage has been one of the many causes in diseases related to aging. The stability of the genome is defined by the cells machinery of repair, damage tolerance, and checkpoint pathways that counteracts DNA damage. One hypothesis proposed by [[Gioacchino Failla]] in 1958&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Failla|first=G|title=The aging process and cancerogenesis|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|date=30 September 1958|volume=71|issue=6|pages=1124–1140|pmid=13583876|bibcode=1958NYASA..71.1124F|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1958.tb46828.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; is that damage accumulation to the DNA causes aging. The hypothesis was developed soon by physicist [[Leó Szilárd]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Szilard|first=Leo|title=On the nature of the aging process|journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.|date=January 1959|volume=45|issue=1|pages=30–45|pmid=16590351|pmc=222509|doi=10.1073/pnas.45.1.30|bibcode=1959PNAS...45...30S}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory has changed over the years as new research has discovered new types of DNA damage and mutations, and several theories of aging argue that DNA damage with or without mutations causes aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Freitas|first=AA|author2=de Magalhaes, JP|title=A review and appraisal of the DNA damage theory of ageing|journal=Mutat Res|date=Jul–Oct 2011|volume=728|issue=1–2|pages=12–22|pmid=21600302|doi=10.1016/j.mrrev.2011.05.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cross-linking theory====

The cross-linking theory proposes that [[advanced glycation end-product]]s (stable bonds formed by the binding of glucose to proteins) and other aberrant [[cross-links]] accumulating in aging tissues is the cause of aging. The crosslinking of proteins disables their biological functions. The hardening of the connective tissue, kidney diseases, and enlargement of the heart are connected to the cross-linking of proteins. [[Crosslinking of DNA]] can induce replication errors, and this leads to deformed cells and increases the risk of [[cancer]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Genetic ===
Genetic theories of aging propose that aging is programmed within each individual's genes. According to this theory, genes dictate cellular longevity. Programmed cell death, or [[apoptosis]], is determined by a "biological clock" via genetic information in the nucleus of the cell. Genes responsible for apoptosis provide an explanation for cell death, but are less applicable to death of an entire organism. An increase in cellular apoptosis may correlate to aging, but is not a 'cause of death'. Environmental factors and genetic mutations can influence gene expression and accelerate aging. More recently epigenetics have been explored as a contributing factor. The [[Biological clock (aging)|epigenetic clock]], which objectively measures the biological age of cells and tissues, may become useful for testing different biological aging theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Horvath S |title=

=== General imbalance ===
General imbalance theories of aging suggest that body systems, such as the [[Endocrine system|endocrine]], [[Nervous system|nervous]], and immune systems, gradually decline and ultimately fail to function. The rate of failure varies system by system.&lt;ref name= Taylor /&gt;

====Immunological theory====

The immunological theory of aging suggests that the immune system weakens as an organism ages. This makes the organism unable to fight infections and less able to destroy old and [[Neoplasm|neoplastic cells]]. This leads to aging and will eventually lead to death. This theory of aging was developed by Ray Walford, an American gerontologist. According to Walford, incorrect immunological procedures are the cause of the process of aging.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Social gerontology ==
Social gerontology is a multi-disciplinary sub-field that specializes in studying or working with older adults. Social gerontologists may have degrees or training in [[social work]], [[nursing]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[demography]], [[public health]], or other [[social science]] disciplines. Social gerontologists are responsible for educating, researching, and advancing the broader causes of older people.

Because issues of life span and life extension need numbers to quantify them, there is an overlap with [[demography]]. Those who study the demography of the human life span differ from those who study the social demographics of aging.

=== Social theories of aging ===
Several theories of aging are developed to observe the aging process of older adults in society as well as how these processes are interpreted by men and women as they age.&lt;ref name=Phillipson&gt;{{cite book |first1=C. |last1=Phillipson |first2=J. |last2=Baars |chapter=Ch. 4: Social theory and social ageing |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=wtYhf5fdTl4C&amp;pg=PA68 |editor1-last=Bond |editor1-first=J. |editor2-last=Peace |editor2-first=S. M. |editor3-last=Dittmann-Kohli |editor3-first=F. |editor4-last=Westerhof |editor4-first=G. |title=Ageing in Society |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wtYhf5fdTl4C |year=2007 |publisher=SAGE |isbn=978-1-4129-0020-1 |pages=68–84 |edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Activity theory ====
[[Activity theory (aging)|Activity theory]] was developed and elaborated by Cavan, Havighurst, and Albrecht. According to this theory, older adults' self-concept depends on social interactions. In order for older adults to maintain morale in old age, substitutions must be made for lost roles. Examples of lost roles include retirement from a job or loss of a spouse.&lt;ref name=Phillipson/&gt;

Activity is preferable to inactivity because it facilitates well-being on multiple levels. Because of improved general health and prosperity in the older population, remaining active is more feasible now than when this theory was first proposed by Havighurst nearly six decades ago. The activity theory is applicable for a stable, [[post-industrial society]], which offers its older members many opportunities for meaningful participation.Weakness: Some aging persons cannot maintain a middle-aged lifestyle, due to functional limitations, lack of income, or lack of a desire to do so. Many older adults lack the resources to maintain active roles in society. On the flip side, some elders may insist on continuing activities in late life that pose a danger to themselves and others, such as driving at night with low visual acuity or doing maintenance work to the house while climbing with severely arthritic knees. In doing so, they are denying their limitations and engaging in unsafe behaviors.&lt;ref name="allnurses-breakroom.com"&gt;VickyRN. (August 2, '09). Theories of Aging (Part 3) - Sociological Theories. Retrieved Friday, April 20, 2012, from http://allnurses-breakroom.com/showthread.php?t=412760&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Disengagement theory ====
[[Disengagement theory]] was developed by Cumming and Henry. According to this theory, older adults and society engage in a mutual separation from each other. An example of mutual separation is retirement from the workforce. A key assumption of this theory is that older adults lose "ego-energy" and become increasingly self-absorbed. Additionally, disengagement leads to higher morale maintenance than if older adults try to maintain social involvement. This theory is heavily criticized for having an escape clause - namely, that older adults who remain engaged in society are unsuccessful adjusters to old age.&lt;ref name=Phillipson/&gt;

Gradual withdrawal from society and relationships preserves social equilibrium and promotes self-reflection for elders who are freed from societal roles. It furnishes an orderly means for the transfer of knowledge, capital, and power from the older generation to the young. It makes it possible for society to continue functioning after valuable older members die.

==== Continuity theory ====
[[Continuity theory]] is an elusive concept. On one hand,
to exhibit continuity can mean to remain the same, to
be uniform, homogeneous, unchanging, even humdrum.
This static view of continuity is not very applicable
to human aging. On the other hand, a dynamic
view of continuity starts with the idea of a basic
structure which persists over time, but it allows for a
variety of changes to occur within the context provided
by the basic structure. The basic structure is
coherent: It has an orderly or logical relation of parts
that is recognizably unique and that allows us to
differentiate that structure from others. With the
introduction of the concept of time, ideas such as
direction, sequence, character development, and
story line enter into the concept of continuity as it is
applied to the evolution of a human being. In this
theory, a dynamic concept of continuity is developed
and applied to the issue of adaptation to normal
aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Blalock, H.M. |title=Conceptualization and measurement in the social sciences |publisher=Sage |location=Beverly Hills |year=1982 |isbn=978-0803918047 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A central premise of continuity theory is that, in
making adaptive choices, middle-aged and older
adults attempt to preserve and maintain existing internal
and external structures and that they prefer to
accomplish this objective by using continuity (i.e.,
applying familiar strategies in familiar arenas of life).
In middle and later life, adults are drawn by the
weight of past experience to use continuity as a
primary adaptive strategy for dealing with changes
associated with normal aging. To the extent that
change builds upon, and has links to, the person's
past, change is a part of continuity. As a result of both
their own perceptions and pressures from the social
environment, individuals who are adapting to normal
aging are both predisposed and motivated
toward inner psychological continuity as well as outward
continuity of social behavior and circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hage, J. |title=Techniques and problems of theory construction in sociology |publisher=Wiley Interscience |location=New York |year=1972 |isbn=978-0471338604 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continuity theory views both internal and
external continuity as robust adaptive strategies that
are supported by both individual preference and
social sanctions. Continuity theory consists of general
adaptive principles that people who are normally 
aging could be expected to follow, explanations of
how these principles work, and a specification of
general areas of life in which these principles could
be expected to apply. Accordingly, continuity theory
has enormous potential as a general theory of
adaptation to individual aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Abraham |last=Kaplan |title=The Conduct of Inquiry: Methodology for Behavioral Science |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ks8wuZHSKs8C |year=1964 |publisher=Transaction Publishers |isbn=978-0-7658-0448-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Age stratification theory ====
According to this theory, older adults born during different time periods form [[cohort (statistics)|cohort]]s that define "age strata". There are two differences among strata: chronological age and historical experience. This theory makes two arguments. 1. Age is a mechanism for regulating behavior and as a result determines access to positions of power. 2. Birth cohorts play an influential role in the process of social change.&lt;ref name=Phillipson/&gt;

==== Life course theory ====
According to this theory, which stems from the Life Course Perspective (Bengston and Allen, 1993),&lt;ref name=life&gt;Life Course Theory-Historical Development, Key Principles and Concepts, Selected Research Applications:http://family.jrank.org/pages/1074/Life-Course-Theory.html&lt;/ref&gt; aging occurs from birth to death. Aging involves social, psychological, and biological processes. Additionally, aging experiences are shaped by cohort and period effects.&lt;ref name=Phillipson/&gt;

Also reflecting the life course focus,
consider the implications for how societies might function when age-based
norms vanish—a consequence of the deinstitutionalization of the life course—
and suggest that these implications pose new challenges for theorizing aging
and the life course in postindustrial societies. Dramatic reductions in mortality,
morbidity, and fertility over the past several decades have so shaken up the
organization of the life course and the nature of educational, work, family, and
leisure experiences that it is now possible for individuals to become old in new
ways. The configurations and content of other life stages are being altered as
well, especially for women. In consequence, theories of age and aging will need
to be reconceptualized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Rowe, J.W. |author2=Kahn, R.L. |title=Successful aging |publisher=Pantheon |location=New York |year=1998 |isbn=978-0375400452 }}&lt;br&gt;Webster, N. (2003). Webster's new American dictionary. New York: HarperCollins.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cumulative advantage/disadvantage theory ====
According to this theory, which was developed beginning in the 1960s by Derek Price and Robert Merton and elaborated on by several researchers such as Dale Dannefer,&lt;ref name=Dennefer&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dannefer D |title=Cumulative advantage/disadvantage and the life course: cross-fertilizing age and social science theory |journal=J Gerontol B Psychol Sci Soc Sci |volume=58 |issue=6 |pages=S327–37 |date=November 2003 |pmid=14614120 |doi=10.1093/geronb/58.6.S327 }}&lt;/ref&gt; inequalities have a tendency to become more pronounced throughout the aging process. A paradigm of this theory can be expressed in the adage "[[the rich get richer and the poor get poorer]]". Advantages and disadvantages in early life stages have a profound effect throughout the life span. However, advantages and disadvantages in middle adulthood have a direct influence on economic and health status in later life.&lt;ref name=Phillipson/&gt;

== Environmental gerontology ==
Environmental gerontology is a specialization within gerontology that seeks an understanding and interventions to optimize the relationship between aging persons and their physical and social environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sanchez-Gonzalez, D. |author2=Rodriguez-Rodriguez, V. |title=Environmental Gerontology in Europe and Latin America. Policies and perspectives on environment and aging|year=2016|publisher=Springer Publishing Company|isbn=978-3-319-21418-4|page=284|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rowles, Graham D. |author2=Bernard, Miriam|title=Environmental Gerontology: Making Meaningful Places in Old Age|year=2013|publisher=Springer Publishing Company|location=New York|isbn=978-0826108135|page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Scheidt, Rick J. |author2=Schwarz, Benyamin|title=Environmental Gerontology.

The field emerged in the 1930s during the first studies on behavioral and social gerontology. In the 1970s and 1980s, research confirmed the importance of the physical and social environment in understanding the aging population and improved the quality of life in old age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Wahl, H-W. |author2=Scheidt, R.J. |author3=Windley, P.G. |title=Annual Review of Gerontology and Geriatrics.

Some research indicates that the physical-social environment is related to the [[longevity]] and [[quality of life]] of the [[elderly]]. Precisely, the [[natural environment]] (such as natural therapeutic [[landscapes]], [[therapeutic garden]]) contributes to active and healthy aging in the place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year=2015 |volume=60 |issue=60 | title=Physical-social environments and aging population from environmental gerontology and geography.

== Jurisprudential gerontology ==
Jurisprudential gerontology (sometimes referred to as "geriatric jurisprudence") is a specialization within gerontology that looks into the ways laws and legal structures interact with the aging experience. The field started from legal scholars in the field of [[elder law]], which found that looking into legal issues of older persons without a broader inter-disciplinary perspective does not provide the ideal legal outcome. Using theories such as [[therapeutic jurisprudence]], jurisprudential scholars critically examined existing legal institutions (e.g. adult guardianship, [[End-of-life care|end of life]] care, or [[Nursing home residents' rights|nursing homes]] regulations) and showed how law should look more closely to the social and psychological aspects of its real-life operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/mlv15&amp;div=27&amp;id=&amp;page=|title=Therapeutic Jurisprudence and End-of-Life Medical Care: Physician Perceptions of a Statute's Impact Medical Law 15 Medicine and Law 1996|pages=201–17|journal=Medicine and Law|volume=15|issue=2|access-date=2018-03-20|year=1996|last1=Kapp|first1=Marshall B.|pmid=8908972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other streams within jurisprudential gerontology also encouraged physicians and lawyers to try to improve their cooperation and better understand how laws and regulatory institutions affect health and well being of older persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doron|first=Israel|last2=Meenan|first2=Helen|date=2012|title=Time for Geriatric Jurisprudence|url=https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/335324|journal=Gerontology|language=english|volume=58|issue=3|pages=193–6|doi=10.1159/000335324|pmid=22538767|issn=0304-324X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[biology]], '''gonochorism''' (''[[Greek language|Greek]]'' offspring + disperse) or '''unisexualism''' or '''gonochory''' describes the state of having just one of at least two distinct sexes in any one individual organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gonochorism|url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/research-curation/research/projects/cestode-life-cycle/database/glossary.jsp#G|work=Glossary|publisher=The Natural History Museum|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is most often used with animals, in which the individual organisms are often gonochorous. Gonochory is less common in [[plantae|plants]]. For example, in [[flowering plant]]s, individual flowers may be hermaphroditic (i.e. with both stamens and ovaries) or gonochorous (unisexual), having either no stamens (i.e. no male parts) or no ovaries (i.e. no female parts). Among flowering plant species that have unisexual flowers, some also produce hermaphrodite flowers, and the three types occur in different arrangements on separate plants; species can be [[monoecious]], [[dioecious]], [[trioecious]], [[polygamomonoecious]], [[polygamodioecious]], [[andromonoecious]], or [[gynomonoecious]].

[[File:Schistosome_Parasite_SEM.jpg|right|thumb|Unlike most [[Platyhelminthes|flatworms]], [[Schistosoma|schistosomes]] are gonochoristic. The narrow female can be seen emerging from the thicker male's gynecophoral canal below his ventral sucker.]] 

Sex is most often genetically determined, but may be determined by other mechanisms. For example, [[alligator]]s use [[temperature-dependent sex determination]] during egg incubation. Examples of gonochoric or dioecious [[pollination]] include [[holly|hollies]] and [[kiwifruit]]. In these plants the male plant that supplies the [[pollen]] is referred to as the [[pollenizer]].

Gonochorism stands in contrast to other [[reproductive strategy|reproductive strategies]] such as [[asexual reproduction]] and [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditism]]. The sex of an individual may also change during its lifetime – this [[sequential hermaphroditism]] can for example be found in [[parrotfish]]&lt;ref&gt;Bester, C. ''[http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/Gallery/Descript/Sparrotfish/SParrotfish.html Stoplight parrotfish]'' Florida Museum of Natural History, Ichthyology Department. Accessed 15-12-2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Afonsoa&gt;Afonsoa, Moratoa &amp; Santos (2008). ''Spatial patterns in reproductive traits of the temperate parrotfish Sparisoma cretense.''

}} (Definition)&lt;/ref&gt; Socially, “intellectualism” negatively connotes: single-mindedness of purpose (“too much attention to thinking”) and emotional coldness (“the absence of affection and feeling”).&lt;ref name="HighBeam" /&gt;&lt;ref name="encarta" /&gt;

==Ancient moral intellectualism==
In the view of [[Socrates]] (c. 470 – 399 BC), intellectualism allows that “one will do what is right or best just as soon as one truly understands what is right or best”; that [[virtue]] is a purely intellectual matter, since virtue and [[knowledge]] are familial relatives, which a person accrues and improves with dedication to [[reason]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |df          = 
}} (Definition and note on Socrates)&lt;/ref&gt; So defined, [[Socratic intellectualism]] became a key philosophic doctrine of [[Stoicism]]. The apparent, problematic consequences of this view are “Socratic paradoxes”, such as the view that there is no [[weakness of will]] — that no one knowingly does, or seeks to do, evil (moral wrong); that anyone who does, or seeks to do, moral wrong does so involuntarily; and that virtue is knowledge, that there are not many virtues, but that all virtues are one.

Contemporary philosophers dispute that Socrates’s conceptions of knowing truth, and of ethical conduct, can be equated with modern, post–[[Cartesianism|Cartesian]] conceptions of knowledge and of rational intellectualism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=No one errs willingly: the meaning of socratic intellectualism | author=Heda Segvic | url=http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.co.uk/pdf/0-19-924226-7.pdf | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930151328/http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.co.uk/pdf/0-19-924226-7.pdf | archivedate=2011-09-30 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, [[Michel Foucault]] demonstrated, with detailed historical study, that in [[Classical Antiquity]] (800 BC – AD 1000), “knowing the truth” is akin to “spiritual knowledge”, in the contemporarily understanding of the concept. Hence, without exclusively concerning the rational intellect, spiritual knowledge is integral to the broader principle of “caring for the self”.

Typically, such care of the self-involved specific [[ascetic]] exercises meant to ensure that not only was knowledge of truth memorized, but learned, and then integrated to the self, in the course of transforming oneself into a [[Value (ethics)|good]] person. Therefore, to understand truth meant “intellectual knowledge” requiring one’s integration to the (universal) truth, and [[Authenticity (philosophy)|authentically]] living it in one’s speech, heart, and conduct. Achieving that difficult task required continual care of the self, but also meant being someone who embodies truth, and so can readily practice the [[Rhetoric|Classical]]-era rhetorical device of [[parrhesia]]: “to speak candidly, and to ask forgiveness for so speaking”; and, by extension, practice the [[Morality|moral]] obligation to speak the truth for the common good, even at personal risk.&lt;ref&gt;Gros, Frederic (ed.)(2005) ''Michel Foucault: The Hermeneutics of the Subject'', Lectures at the College de France 1981–1982. Picador: New York&lt;/ref&gt; This ancient, Socratic moral philosophic perspective contradicts the contemporary understanding of truth and knowledge as [[Reason|rational]] undertakings.

==Medieval theological intellectualism&lt;!--'Medieval theological intellectualism' redirects here; linked from 'Averroes', 'Thomas Aquinas', and 'Meister Eckhart'--&gt;==
'''Medieval theological intellectualism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is a doctrine of divine action, wherein the faculty of [[intellect]] precedes, and is superior to, the faculty of the [[Will (philosophy)|will]] (''voluntas intellectum sequitur''). As such, Intellectualism is contrasted with [[Voluntarism (philosophy)|voluntarism]], which proposes the Will as superior to the intellect, and to the emotions; hence, the stance that “according to intellectualism, choices of the Will result from that which the intellect recognizes as good; the will, itself, is determined. For voluntarism, by contrast, it is the Will which identifies which objects are good, and the Will, itself, is indetermined”.&lt;ref name=IEP&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.iep.utm.edu/v/voluntar.htm | title = Voluntarism| publisher = Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; From that philosophical perspective and historical context, the Spanish [[Islam|Muslim]] polymath [[Averroës]] (1126–1198) in the 12th century, the Italian Christian theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225–1274), and the German Christian theologian [[Meister Eckhart]] (1260–1327) in the 13th century, are recognised intellectualists.&lt;ref name=IEP/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah Hackett, ''A Companion to Meister Eckhart'', BRILL, 2012, p. 410.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Isaako Aaitui''' (born January 25, 1987) is an [[American football]] [[nose tackle]] who is currently a free agent. He was originally signed by the [[Miami Dolphins]] as an [[undrafted free agent]] in 2011. He played [[college football]] at [[UNLV Rebels football|UNLV]].

==Early years==
Aaitui attended Faga'itua High School in Pago Pago, where he played [[Rugby football|rugby]], [[volleyball]] and [[Association football|soccer]] in addition to [[high school football|football]] prior to graduating in 2006.&lt;ref name="UNLVBio"&gt;{{cite web | title = Player Bio: Isaako Aaitui | work = UNLVRebels.com | url = http://www.unlvrebels.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/aaitui_isaako00.html | accessdate = 17 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==College career==
After redshirting at [[UNLV Rebels football|UNLV]] in 2006, Aaitui made his Rebels debut in 2007, appearing in seven games and recording 10 tackles (two for a loss).&lt;ref name="UNLVBio"/&gt; He started nine of 12 games played as a sophomore in 2008, totaling 32 tackles (14 solo), leading the team with seven tackles for a loss and tying for the team lead with two sacks.&lt;ref name="UNLVBio"/&gt;

Aaitui started 10 of 12 games at defensive tackle as a junior in 2009, recording 31 tackles and 2.5 tackles for a loss.&lt;ref name="UNLVBio"/&gt; He closed out his collegiate career with 27 tackles (5 for a loss), 1.5 sacks, a forced fumble, a fumble recovery and a blocked kick.&lt;ref name="UNLVBio"/&gt;

==Professional career==

===First stint with Dolphins===
After going undrafted in the [[2012 NFL Draft]], Aaitui did not attend training camp and did not sign with a team until joining the [[practice squad]] of the [[Miami Dolphins]] on October 5, 2011.&lt;ref name="PracticeSquad"&gt;{{cite web | title = Dolphins sign OT Will Barker away from Buccaneers; make practice squad moves | work = Phins-Spotlight.com | url = http://www.phins-spotlight.com/2011/10/dolphins-sign-ot-will-barker-away-from.html | accessdate = 17 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained on the practice squad the rest of his rookie season and was re-signed to a future contract in January 2012.&lt;ref name="FutureDeal"&gt;{{cite web | title = Dolphins re-sign seven to future contracts | work = Phins-Spotlight.com | url = http://www.phins-spotlight.com/2012/01/dolphins-sign-seven-to-future-contracts.html | accessdate = 17 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aaitui's attempt to make the Dolphins' roster in 2012 was documented on the [[Home Box Office|HBO]] series ''[[Hard Knocks (TV series)|Hard Knocks: Training Camp with the Miami Dolphins]]''.&lt;ref name="HardKnocks"&gt;{{cite web | title = Hard Knocks' Isaako Aaitui waived by Jets after injury | work = NFL.com | url = http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000058465/article/hard-knocks-isaako-aaitui-waived-by-jets-after-injury | accessdate = 17 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He came up just short of earning a roster spot and was waived by the team during final cuts, with the organization hoping to retain him on the practice squad.&lt;ref name="HardKnocks"/&gt;

===New York Jets===
After being waived by the Dolphins, Aaitui made his first NFL roster when he was claimed by the [[New York Jets]] on September 2.&lt;ref name="HardKnocks"/&gt; However, he suffered a [[Anterior cruciate ligament injury|torn ACL]] and [[Medial knee injuries|MCL]] in his first practice with the Jets and was subsequently waived two days later.&lt;ref name="HardKnocks"/&gt;

===New Orleans Saints===

'''Jennifer Aaker''' (born 1967, California) is an American social psychologist, author and General Atlantic Professor of Marketing at [[Stanford Graduate School of Business]]. Best known for her research on time, money and happiness,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cook|first=Nancy|title=The Corporate Pursuit of Happiness|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1722637/corporate-pursuit-happiness|work=March, 2011|publisher=Fast Company|accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaker also focuses on the transmission of ideas through social networks, the power of story in decision making, and how to build global brands across cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Brainiacs: Most Influential Women In Technology|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/women-in-tech/2011/brainiacs/jennifer-aaker|work=2011|publisher=Fast Company|accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Faculty Profile:  Jennifer Aaker|url=http://faculty-gsb.stanford.edu/aaker/|publisher=Stanford Graduate School of Business|accessdate=6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is the recipient of the Distinguished Scientific Achievement Award from the [[Society for Consumer Psychology]] and the Stanford Distinguished Teaching Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jennifer Aaker: Psychology Today |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/experts/jennifer-aaker |work=2014 |publisher=Psychology Today |accessdate=27 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306113958/http://www.psychologytoday.com/experts/jennifer-aaker |archivedate= 6 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Aaker was born in [[Palo Alto, California]], to Kay Aaker,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wake|first=Jennifer|title=The Gift of Time: Skilled Volunteers Found in Local Retirees|url=http://www.volunteereastbay.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/The_Gift_of_Time.pdf|work=April 15, 2009|publisher=La Morinda Weekly|accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[David Aaker]], a professor and brand consultant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David A. Aaker, Author Profile|url=http://authors.simonandschuster.com/David-A-Aaker/1451364|publisher=Simon and Schuster|accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaker attended the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where she studied under social psychologist [[Philip E. Tetlock]] and [[Nobel Prize]] winner [[Daniel Kahneman]], receiving a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[Psychology]] in 1989. In 1990, Aaker began postgraduate work at Stanford Graduate School of Business, earning a Ph.D. in marketing with a minor in psychology in 1995. Her dissertation on brand personality led to the publication of three academic papers  in ''Journal of Marketing Research'' and ''Journal of Consumer Research'' and won several awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honors and Recognition |url=http://faculty.gsb.stanford.edu/aaker/documents/Aaker_Vita.pdf |work=2013 |publisher=Stanford University |accessdate=15 June 2013 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Aaker began her academic career in 1995 as an assistant professor at the [[UCLA Anderson School of Management]].  In 1999, she returned to the Stanford Graduate School of Business as an assistant professor, was promoted to associate professor in 2001, and earned a full professorship in 2004. In 2005, Aaker was named General Atlantic Professor of Marketing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aaker CV at Stanford Graduate School of Business |url=http://faculty-gsb.stanford.edu/aaker/documents/Aaker_Vita.pdf |work=January, 2013 |publisher=Stanford University |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130722150424/http://faculty-gsb.stanford.edu/aaker/documents/Aaker_Vita.pdf |archivedate=2013-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her work has been published in scholarly journals in psychology and marketing and has been highlighted in ''[[The Economist]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek|BusinessWeek]]'', ''[[Forbes]],'' [[NPR]], ''[[CBS MoneyWatch]]'', ''[[Inc. (magazine)|Inc.]]'' and ''[[Science (journal)|Science]].'' She serves as an advisory board member for several private companies.

As a social psychologist and marketer, Aaker began her research career by proposing a "Dimensions of Brand Personality" framework to describe and measure the "personality" of a brand, defined as the set of human characteristics associated with it. The five core dimensions are Sincerity, Excitement, Competence, Sophistication, and Ruggedness.  In a global analysis of brands, Aaker and her colleagues revealed two novel brand personality dimensions. In Japan, individuals viewed brands as Peaceful, and in Spain, individuals viewed brands as Passionate.  Aaker’s model showed that brand personality dimensions influence consumer preference and choice and provided a framework that illuminated how to build strong global brands that meet multi-cultural needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aaker|first=Jennifer|title=Dimensions of Brand Personality|date=August 1997|url=http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/groups/finance/Papers/Dimensions%20of%20BP%20JMR%201997.pdf|accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Aaker shifted her research focus to understanding time, money and happiness. In this work, she suggested that time is a resource that, like money, is not only important but more subjective than we think. In 2010, she published two papers with [[Sepandar Kamvar|Sep Kamvar]] and Cassie Mogilner on the dynamic meaning of happiness.  Prior research had suggested that the meaning of happiness is either similar across individuals, or highly subjective and idiosyncratic.  Aaker and her colleagues show that the answer lies between the two and that there is in fact a predictable shift in the meaning of happiness and how it is experienced over one's life and even within the day or week. The research also showed that the meaning of happiness that one holds impacts the choices people make.

Aaker has also examined questions such as why people give to others, how small acts create significant change, and how those effects can be fueled by social media.

In 2010, Aaker and her husband, startup advisor Andy Smith, authored the book ''The Dragonfly Effect:  Quick, Effective and Powerful Ways to Use Social Media to Drive Social Change.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dragonfly Effect|url=http://www.dragonflyeffect.com/|work=2013|publisher=Official Website|accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;    With a title inspired by the dragonfly’s unique ability to propel itself in any direction when its four wings worked in concert, the book examined the manner in which synchronized ideas can be used to create rapid transformations through social media. A literary award winner,[5] ''The Dragonfly Effect'' has been translated into over 10 languages. In 2013, Aaker, Smith and McCarthy published ''The Power of Stories'', a companion to ''The Dragonfly Effect'', which further explored social media through psychological insight and provided a hands-on tool to help companies put the model to work.

In a real world demonstration of the Dragonfly Effect, Aaker and her students founded 100K Cheeks,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=David|first=Avril|title=Names You Need to Know|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/avrildavid/2011/05/17/names-you-need-to-know-the-dragonfly-effect/|work=May 17, 2011|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Power of Stores|ISBN=1484184386}}&lt;/ref&gt;  an organization dedicated to registering 100,000 South Asian donors in the National Bone Marrow Registry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Past Challenges (Get Involved) |url=http://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/haas/100kcheeks |publisher=Haas Center for Public Service |accessdate=13 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221230214/http://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/haas/100kcheeks |archivedate=21 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;   In addition to utilizing social networks, Aaker ran the first ever cheek swab in India; as a result of these efforts, 100K Cheeks exceeded their goal by registering more than 115,000 potential donors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jennifer Aaker: Pursuit of Happiness|url=http://www.inktalks.com/discover/53/pursuit-of-happiness|work=November 27, 2011|publisher=Ink Talks|accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beth Kanter Katie Delahaye Paine|first=Katie Delahaye Paine|title=Measuring the Networked Nonprofit: Using Data to Change the World|year=2012|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|isbn=978-1-118-13760-4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vL_lhYF0Uf4C&amp;pg=PT36&amp;lpg=PT36&amp;dq=jennifer+aaker+100k+cheeks}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dragonfly Effect|url=http://www.ssireview.org/articles/entry/the_dragonfly_effect|work=October 2011|publisher=Stanford Social Innovation Review|accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Social media is not inherently meaningful," Aaker said in an interview on the subject.

The '''Kherubim''' or Kherans are an [[List of extraterrestrials in fiction|alien race]] in the [[fiction]]al [[Wildstorm Universe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/24114-wildstorm-vets-reunite-for-oral-history.html |title=WILDSTORM Vets Reunite For Oral History |publisher=[[Newsarama.com]] |date=2015-04-13 |accessdate=2015-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were created by [[Jim Lee]] and first appeared in ''[[Wildcats (comics)|WildC.A.Ts]]'' #1 (August 1992).

==Biology==
Kherubim are various groups/races of people from the planet Khera. Kherubim resemble humans in appearance but are physically far stronger and more durable and extremely long-lived, nearly [[Immortality|immortal]]. [[Savant (Wildstorm)|Savant]] was harmed by armor-piercing machine gun bullets; however, after they are surgically removed, she makes a full and rapid recovery. Kherans (including Titanthropes) can interbreed with humans, bearing fertile offspring.

An evolutionary drawback to their near-immortality is that nearly all Kheran females are [[infertile]]; only very rarely will a Kheran produce offspring. This is a natural check against overpopulation. Only one in 10,000 Kheran females is capable of giving birth, and only then at her very first mating. Of those, only one in approximately 10,000 will become pregnant, and only 1 in 1000 of those babies will be born alive; the rest are stillborn. The saving grace of the species is that this infertility does not seem to apply when the Kheran is mating with another species, as Earth has various Kheran/human hybrids.

More powerful Kherans are known as Lords and may possess telekinetic and energy manipulation abilities. [[Mister Majestic]], [[Lord Emp]] and [[Spartan (comics)|Yohn Khol]] are Kherubim Lords.
 
Shapers are a [[subspecies]] of Kherans. They are [[shapeshifters]] who are able to manipulate the molecular structure of their bodies, transforming part or all of their bodies into a substance with [[metal]]lic properties, which they can manipulate and reshape at will. The Wildcat [[Warblade (comics)|Warblade]] is a Shaper.

Though genetically a different species, the Titanthropes (or simply Titans) have been part of Kherubim society for so long that they are also often called Kherubim. However, they are considered and treated as second-class citizens of Khera by the Kherubim. They are large, purple-skinned humanoids who are able to increase or decrease their mass. Males have large yellow horns growing from their backs. A Titan's intelligence is inversely proportional to their current size. The Wildcat [[Maul (Wildstorm)|Maul]] is a Titanthrope.

==History==
Thousands of years ago, the Kherubim destroyed their own planet, according to Titan myth. They then came to Khera and settled it, subjugating the Titans. The Titans would slowly become more or less accepted within the Kherubim society but remained [[second-class citizen]]s.

Millennia ago, the Kherans came into contact with the [[Daemonite]]s and a war erupted between both species. This war would last several centuries. A small group of Kherans and Daemonites crashlanded on Earth and inspired humanity with tales of gods, angels, demons, and monsters. Their conflict would continue until the end of the 20th century, while in space the Kherans would go on to defeat the Daemonites. Kherans imposed heavy [[indemnity|indemnities]] on the Daemonites and their society went bankrupt trying to pay them off. Khera allowed Daemonites to migrate to the more prosperous planet, but forced these Daemonites refugees to live in [[ghetto]]s.

When a small group of Kheran and half-Kheran heroes from Earth known as the [[Wildcats (comics)|WildC.A.Ts]] arrived on Khera, they were welcomed as heroes, but quickly learned that Kheran society had changed over the years. Disgusted with the autocratic nature of Kheran society, they left the planet and returned to Earth.

Later, the Kherubim lord [[Mister Majestic|Majestros]] found hidden Kheran devices, known as Planet Shaper Engines, beneath the surface of the Earth. This caused the realization that humanity and Kherans were closely related and that similar species had been seeded throughout the universe, creating both the Daemonites and Kherans in addition to humans.

The Shaper Guild from Khera arrived on Earth and announced that factions within Kherubim society had decided on using Planet Shaper Engines to transform the Earth into another Khera, causing a civil war.

==Culture==
Kherans are a warrior race with a strong emphasis on hand-to-hand combat and [[honor]].

Due to their low fertility, every Kheran man and woman coming of age has to mate with an appointed partner. If the woman gives birth, she must become a priestess. If not, she may go on to live her life as she wishes. [[Zealot (Wildstorm)|Lady Zannah]] has managed to avoid becoming a priestess, despite giving birth, because her mother told others that the baby had died, allowing Zannah to become a warrior. Her mother then passed Zannah's baby, [[Savant (Wildstorm)|Kenesha]], off as Zealot's sister. As a mother of two children, Zannah's mother, Harmony, has become a living legend. No Kheran can remember the last time a Kheran woman gave birth to more than one child in her life. Zannah became the founder of the [[Coda (Wildstorm)|Coda]] Sisterhood.

Older and more powerful Kherans are named Lords. It remains unclear what makes a Kheran a Lord, but a Lord is capable of undergoing the ritual of Ascension when he is ready. The Ascension ritual is an important part of the Kheran culture, where a Lord asks a partner or good friend to destroy his body so that his spirit can be free. A Lord usually has so much energy stored in his body that this process tends to consume both Kherans.

The Coda worship a goddess, Hecate, but little is known about this religion. Other Kherans apparently do not worship any gods but believe in individual enlightenment through Ascension.

Though originally seen as noble and protective of other species, the Kherans were later shown to be quite [[speciesism|speciesist]], looking down upon other species while perceiving themselves as tolerant and benevolent.

==Politics==
The Kherans have a political system where various parties vie for power. The various factions include:
*The Pantheon, the party of the Lords. They are currently in power and stand for stability and economic progress.
*The Coda, a sisterhood of warriors. They want war and combat to prove their worth.
*The Shapers Guild represents all Shapers within Kheran society. They follow the orders from the Pantheon but have their own secret agenda. They claim to shape the destiny of Khera and are aware of its true origin.
*The Titantropes, while individually repressed by the Kherubim, hold great power as a faction. While being only a small political faction, it is in fact their vote that either keeps the Pantheon in power or puts the Coda in power.
* The Brotherhood of the Sword: a male version of the Coda, its members are created through [[genetic engineering]] and [[cloning]]. They devote their whole life to the mastery of bladed weapons and suppressing their own emotions. Some Bladesmen sacrifice themselves to become Scimitars, using stolen DNA from the Shapers Guild to become living war machines. The Brotherhood on Earth betrayed Khera and allied themselves with the Daemonites.
* The Adrastea: a race of Kherubim empaths, originally bred to be slaves, but they soon became the largest [[organized crime|crime syndicate]] in Kheran society.

==Technology==
While preferring bladed weapons in combat, Kherans are technologically advanced. They own spaceships capable of interstellar flights. They are capable of inscribing knowledge in the form of organic molecules, which when injected into the bloodstream, downloads that knowledge straight into the brain. They are capable of manipulating the laws of chance, simply for the purpose of entertainment as their 'Coincidental Mansion' shows. Armies of very advanced [[Android (robot)|androids]] known as the [[Spartan (comics)|Spartan Guards]] serve as soldiers. Spartan Guards have shown high intelligence and superhuman physical capabilities. Kherubim Planet Shapers can [[Terraforming|terraform]] worlds and alter living DNA and can remain functional for billions of years.

==Notable Kherans==
*[[Mister Majestic|Lord Majestros]], the greatest living hero for all Kherubim.
*[[Lord Emp]], ascended from the physical plane. Former member of the Pantheon.
*[[Zealot (Wildstorm)|Lady Zannah]], former member of the Coda.
*[[Savant (Wildstorm)|Kenesha]]
*[[Spartan (comics)|Lord Yohn Kohl]], the template for the android Spartan.
*Lord S'lyton, father of [[Backlash (Marc Slayton)|Marc Slayton]]
*Ferrian, member of [[Wildcore]].
*Charis, also known as [[Nemesis (Wildstorm)|Nemesis]]. An Adrastea with empathic abilities, trained by the Coda.

[[Image:Langtons Loop.png|frame|right|Langton's Loop, in the starting configuration.]]

'''Langton's loops''' are a particular "species" of [[artificial life]] in a [[cellular automaton]] created in 1984 by [[Christopher Langton]]. They consist of a loop of cells containing genetic information, which flows continuously around the loop and out along an "arm" (or [[pseudopod]]), which will become the daughter loop. The "genes" instruct it to make three left turns, completing the loop, which then disconnects from its parent.

== History ==

In 1952 [[John von Neumann]] created the first cellular automaton (CA) with the goal of creating a self-replicating machine.&lt;ref name=TSRA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walenz.org/vonNeumann/index.html |title=''Theory of Self-Reproducing Automata.'' |author=von Neumann, John |author2=Burks, Arthur W. |date=1966 |publisher=www.walenz.org |format=Scanned book online |accessdate=2008-02-29 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105213853/http://www.walenz.org/vonNeumann/index.html |archivedate=2008-01-05 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This automaton was necessarily very complex due to its computation- and construction-universality. In 1968 [[Edgar F. Codd]] reduced the number of states from 29 in [[von Neumann cellular automaton|von Neumann's CA]] to 8 in [[Codd's cellular automaton|his]].&lt;ref name=Codd68&gt;{{cite book|author = Codd, Edgar F.|title=Cellular Automata|publisher=Academic Press, New York|year=1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Christopher Langton did away with the universality condition, he was able to significantly reduce the automaton's complexity. Its self-replicating loops are based on one of the simplest elements in Codd's automaton, the periodic emitter.

== Specification ==

Langton's Loops run in a CA that has 8 states, and uses the [[von Neumann neighborhood]] with rotational symmetry. The [[State transition table|transition table]] can be found here: [http://code.google.com/p/ruletablerepository/wiki/TheRules#Self-replicating_loops].

As with [[Codd's cellular automaton|Codd's CA]], Langton's Loops consist of sheathed wires. The signals travel passively along the wires until they reach the open ends, when the command they carry is executed.

[[Image:Langtons Loop Colony.png|thumb|right|A colony of loops. The ones in the centre are "dead".]]

=== Colonies ===

Because of a particular property of the loops' "pseudopodia", they are unable to reproduce into the space occupied by another loop. Thus, once a loop is surrounded, it is incapable of reproducing, resulting in a [[coral]]-like colony with a thin layer of reproducing organisms surrounding a core of inactive "dead" organisms. Unless provided unbounded space, the colony's size will be limited. The maximum population will be [[asymptote|asymptotic]] to &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \left \lfloor \frac{A}{121} \right \rfloor&lt;/math&gt;, where ''A'' is the total area of the space in cells.

=== Encoding of the genome ===

The loops' genetic code is stored as a series of nonzero-zero state pairs. The standard loop's genome is illustrated in the picture at the top, and may be stated as a series of numbered states starting from the T-junction and running clockwise: 70-70-70-70-70-70-40-40. The '70' command advances the end of the wire by one cell, while the '40-40' sequence causes the left turn. State 3 is used as a temporary marker for several stages.

While the roles of states 0,1,2,3,4 and 7 are similar to Codd's CA, the remaining states 5 and 6 are used instead to mediate the loop replication process. After the loop has completed, state 5 travels counter-clockwise along the sheath of the parent loop to the next corner, causing the next arm to be produced in a different direction.  State 6 temporarily joins the genome of the daughter loop and initialises the growing arm at the next corner it reaches.

The genome is used a total of six times: once to extend the pseudopod to the desired location, four times to complete the loop, and again to [[DNA replication|transfer]] the genome into the daughter loop. Clearly, this is dependent on the fourfold [[rotational symmetry]] of the loop; without it, the loop would be incapable of containing the information required to describe it. The same use of symmetry for genome compression is used in many biological [[viruses]], such as the [[icosahedral symmetry|icosahedral]] [[adenovirus]].

'''Life''' is a characteristic that distinguishes [[physical body|physical entities]] that have [[biological process]]es, such as [[Cell signaling|signaling]] and [[self-sustainability|self-sustaining]] processes, from those that do not, either because such functions have ceased (they have [[Death|died]]), or because they never had such functions and are classified as [[wikt:inanimate|inanimate]]. Various forms of life exist, such as [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, [[fungus|fungi]], [[protist]]s, [[archaea]], and [[bacteria]]. The criteria can at times be ambiguous and may or may not define [[virus]]es, [[viroid]]s, or potential [[Synthetic biology#Synthetic life|synthetic life]] as "living". [[Biology]] is the science concerned with the study of life.

The definition of life is controversial. The current definition is that [[organism]]s are [[Open system (thermodynamics)|open systems]] that maintain [[homeostasis]], are composed of [[Cell (biology)|cells]], have a [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]], undergo [[metabolism]], can [[cell growth|grow]], [[Adaptation|adapt]] to their environment, respond to [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]], [[reproduction|reproduce]] and [[Evolution|evolve]]. However, several other biological definitions have been proposed, and there are some borderline cases of life, such as viruses or viroids. In the past, there have been many attempts to define what is meant by "life" through obsolete concepts such as [[odic force]], [[hylomorphism]], [[spontaneous generation]] and [[vitalism]], that have now been disproved by [[Biological research|biological discoveries]]. [[Abiogenesis]] describes the natural process of life arising from non-living matter, such as simple [[organic compounds]]. Properties common to all organisms include the need for certain core [[chemical element]]s to sustain [[biochemical]] functions.

Life on Earth [[Earliest known life forms|first appeared]] as early as 4.28 billion years ago, soon after [[Origin of water on Earth#Water in the development of Earth|ocean formation 4.41 billion years ago]], and not long after the [[Age of the Earth|formation of the Earth]] 4.54 billion years ago.&lt;ref name="NAT-20170301" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20170301" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC-20170301" /&gt;&lt;ref name="4.3b oldest" /&gt; Earth's current life may have descended from an [[RNA world]], although [[RNA]]-based life may not have been the first. The mechanism by which [[abiogenesis|life began on Earth]] is unknown, though many hypotheses have been formulated and are often based on the [[Miller–Urey experiment]]. The [[earliest known life forms]] are microfossils of bacteria. 3.45 billion year old [[Australia]]n rocks are reported to have contained [[microorganism]]s.&lt;ref name="WU-20171218"&gt;{{cite web |last=Tyrell |first=Kelly April |title=Oldest fossils ever found show life on Earth began before 3.5 billion years ago |url=https://news.wisc.edu/oldest-fossils-ever-found-show-life-on-earth-began-before-3-5-billion-years-ago/ |date=18 December 2017 |website=[[University of Wisconsin-Madison]] |accessdate=18 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PNAS-2017"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schopf |first1=J.

Since its primordial beginnings, life on Earth has changed its environment on a [[geologic time scale]]. To survive in most [[ecosystem]]s, life must often adapt to a wide range of conditions. Some microorganisms, called [[extremophile]]s, thrive in physically or geochemically [[extreme environment]]s that are detrimental to most other life on Earth. [[Aristotle]] was the first person to [[taxonomy (biology)|classify]] organisms. Later, [[Carl Linnaeus]] introduced [[Linnean taxonomy|his system]] of [[binomial nomenclature]] for the classification of [[species]]. Eventually new groups and categories of life were discovered, such as cells and microorganisms, forcing dramatic revisions of the structure of relationships between living organisms. The cell is considered the structural and functional unit of life.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/14425949/Cell-The-Fundamental-Unit-of-Life Chapter-5, The Fundamental Unit of Life]. Monika Mehan. Scribd.&lt;/ref&gt; There are two kinds of cells, [[prokaryote|prokaryotic]] and [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]], both of which consist of [[cytoplasm]] enclosed within a [[membrane]] and contain many [[biomolecules]] such as [[proteins]] and [[nucleic acid]]s. Cells reproduce through a process of [[cell division]], in which the parent cell divides into two or more daughter cells.

Though currently only known on [[Earth]], life need not be restricted to it, and many scientists speculate in the existence of [[extraterrestrial life]]. [[Artificial life]] is a computer simulation or man-made reconstruction of any aspect of life, which is often used to examine systems related to natural life. Death is the permanent termination of all [[Biological process|biological functions]] which sustain an organism, and as such, is the end of its life. [[Extinction]] is the process by which an entire group or [[taxon]], normally a [[species]], dies out. [[Fossil]]s are the preserved remains or [[trace fossil|traces]] of organisms.

[[File:Characteristics of life.svg|thumb|The characteristics of life]]
Since there is no unequivocal definition of life, most current definitions in biology are descriptive. Life is considered a characteristic of something that preserves, furthers or reinforces its existence in the given environment. This characteristic exhibits all or most of the following traits:&lt;ref name=McKay/&gt;&lt;ref name=Koshland&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The Seven Pillars of Life |journal=Science |date=22 March 2002 |first=Daniel E. |last=Koshland, Jr. |volume=295 |issue=5563 |pages=2215–16 |doi=10.1126/science.1068489 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/295/5563/2215 |accessdate=25 May 2009 |pmid=11910092 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228202918/http://sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/295/5563/2215 |archivedate=28 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |last= |first= |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-618-70173-5 |edition=4th |location= |pages= |chapter=life |quote= |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/life|title=Life|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Merriam-Webster Dictionary|accessdate=12 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110042620/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/life|archivedate=10 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://phoenix.lpl.arizona.edu/mars141.php |title=Habitability and Biology: What are the Properties of Life? |accessdate=6 June 2013 |website=Phoenix Mars Mission |publisher=The University of Arizona |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6P58Tsw9q?url=http://phoenix.lpl.arizona.edu/mars141.php |archivedate=24 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JBS-2012Feb"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Trifonov |first=Edward N. |title=Definition of Life: Navigation through Uncertainties |url=http://www.jbsdonline.com/mc_images/category/4317/21-trifonov-jbsd_29_4_2012.pdf |journal=Journal of Biomolecular Structure &amp; Dynamics |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=647–50 |issn=0739-1102 |accessdate=12 January 2012 |doi=10.1080/073911012010525017 |pmid=22208269 |date=2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127142426/http://www.jbsdonline.com/mc_images/category/4317/21-trifonov-jbsd_29_4_2012.pdf |archivedate=27 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/45963181/ns/technology_and_science/#.WCcX-snQf0w |title=Can scientists define 'life' ... using just three words? |last=Zimmer |first=Carl |date=11 January 2012 |work=NBC News |access-date=12 November 2016 |via= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414085107/http://www.nbcnews.com/id/45963181/ns/technology_and_science#.WCcX-snQf0w |archivedate=14 April 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''[[Homeostasis]]''': regulation of the internal environment to maintain a constant state; for example, sweating to reduce temperature
# '''[[Biological organization|Organization]]''': being structurally composed of one or more [[cell (biology)|cells]]&amp;nbsp;– the basic units of life
# '''[[Metabolism]]''': transformation of energy by converting chemicals and energy into cellular components ([[anabolism]]) and decomposing organic matter ([[catabolism]]). Living things require [[bioenergetics|energy]] to maintain internal organization (homeostasis) and to produce the other phenomena associated with life.
# '''[[Cell growth|Growth]]''': maintenance of a higher rate of anabolism than catabolism. A growing organism increases in size in all of its parts, rather than simply accumulating matter.
# '''[[Adaptation]]''': the ability to change over time in response to the environment. This ability is fundamental to the process of [[evolution]] and is determined by the organism's [[heredity]], diet, and external factors.
# '''Response to [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]]''': a response can take many forms, from the contraction of a [[unicellular organism]] to external chemicals, to complex reactions involving all the senses of [[multicellular organisms]]. A response is often expressed by motion; for example, the leaves of a plant turning toward the sun ([[phototropism]]), and [[chemotaxis]].
# '''[[Reproduction]]''': the ability to produce new individual organisms, either [[asexual reproduction|asexually]] from a single parent organism or [[sexual reproduction|sexually]] from two parent organisms.

These complex processes, called [[Physiology|physiological functions]], have underlying physical and chemical bases, as well as [[Signalling (biology)|signaling and control mechanisms]] that are essential to maintaining life.

===Living systems theories===
Living systems are open [[self-organization|self-organizing]] living things that interact with their [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]]. These systems are maintained by flows of information, [[energy flow (ecology)|energy]], and matter.

Some scientists have proposed in the last few decades that a general living systems theory is required to explain the nature of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Woodruff |first=T. Sullivan |authorlink= |author2=John Baross |title=Planets and Life: The Emerging Science of Astrobiology |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=8 October 2007 |location= |pages= |url= |doi= |id= |isbn=}}
Cleland and Chyba wrote a chapter in Planets and Life: "In the absence of such a theory, we are in a position analogous to that of a 16th-century investigator trying to define 'water' in the absence of molecular theory." [...] "Without access to living things having a different historical origin, it is difficult and perhaps ultimately impossible to formulate an adequately general theory of the nature of living systems".&lt;/ref&gt; Such a general theory would arise out of the ecological and [[Biology|biological sciences]] and attempt to map general principles for how all living systems work. Instead of examining phenomena by attempting to break things down into components, a general living systems theory explores phenomena in terms of dynamic patterns of the relationships of organisms with their environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Patterns, Flows, and Interrelationship |url=http://www.mollyyoungbrown.com/systems_article.htm |accessdate=2009-06-27 |first=Molly Young |last=Brown |date=2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108122526/http://www.mollyyoungbrown.com/systems_article.htm |archivedate=8 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gaia hypothesis====

The idea that the Earth is alive is found in philosophy and religion, but the first scientific discussion of it was by the Scottish scientist [[James Hutton]]. In 1785, he stated that the Earth was a superorganism and that its proper study should be [[physiology]].

====Nonfractionability====
The first attempt at a general [[living systems]] theory for explaining the nature of life was in 1978, by American biologist [[James Grier Miller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Woodruff |first=T. Sullivan |author2=John Baross |title=Planets and Life: The Emerging Science of Astrobiology |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-82421-7 |date=8 October 2007}} Cleland and Chyba wrote a chapter in Planets and Life: "In the absence of such a theory, we are in a position analogous to that of a 16th-century investigator trying to define 'water' in the absence of molecular theory."...&amp;nbsp;"Without access to living things having a different historical origin, it is difficult and perhaps ultimately impossible to formulate an adequately general theory of the nature of living systems".&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Rosen (theoretical biologist)|Robert Rosen]] (1991) built on this by defining a system component as "a unit of organization; a part with a function, i.e., a definite relation between part and whole." From this and other starting concepts, he developed a "relational theory of systems" that attempts to explain the special properties of life. Specifically, he identified the "nonfractionability of components in an organism" as the fundamental difference between living systems and "biological machines."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Life Itself: A Comprehensive Inquiry into the Nature, Origin, and Fabrication of Life |first1=Rosen |last1=Robert |date=November 1991 |isbn=978-0-231-07565-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Life as a property of ecosystems====
A systems view of life treats environmental [[flux]]es and biological fluxes together as a "reciprocity of influence,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.calresco.org/fiscus/esl.htm |title=The Ecosystemic Life Hypothesis |last=Fiscus |first=Daniel A. |date=April 2002 |website= |publisher=Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090806015449/http://www.calresco.org/fiscus/esl.htm|archive-date=6 August 2009|dead-url=yes |accessdate=28 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a reciprocal relation with environment is arguably as important for understanding life as it is for understanding ecosystems. As [[Harold J. Morowitz]] (1992) explains it, life is a property of an [[ecosystem|ecological system]] rather than a single organism or species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Morowitz |first1=Harold J. |date=1992 |title=Beginnings of cellular life: metabolism recapitulates biogenesis |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-05483-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CmQDSHN_UrIC |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160905030901/https://books.google.com/books?id=CmQDSHN_UrIC |archivedate=5 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that an ecosystemic definition of life is preferable to a strictly [[biochemical]] or physical one. [[Robert Ulanowicz]] (2009) highlights mutualism as the key to understand the systemic, order-generating behavior of life and ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Robert W. |last1=Ulanowicz |first2=Robert E. |last2=Ulanowicz |title=A third window: natural life beyond Newton and Darwin |publisher=Templeton Foundation Press |date=2009 |isbn=978-1-59947-154-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gAQKAQAAMAAJ |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160903180028/https://books.google.com/books?id=gAQKAQAAMAAJ |archivedate=3 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Complex systems biology====
{{main|Complex systems biology}}{{See also|Mathematical biology}}
Complex systems biology (CSB) is a field of science that studies the emergence of complexity in functional organisms from the viewpoint of [[dynamic systems]] theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baianu |first1=I. C. |date=2006 |title=Robert Rosen's Work and Complex Systems Biology |url= |journal=Axiomathes |volume=16 |issue=1–2 |pages=25–34 |doi=10.1007/s10516-005-4204-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter is also often called [[systems biology]] and aims to understand the most fundamental aspects of life. A closely related approach to CSB and systems biology called relational biology is concerned mainly with understanding life processes in terms of the most important relations, and categories of such relations among the essential functional components of organisms; for multicellular organisms, this has been defined as "categorical biology", or a model representation of organisms as a [[category theory]] of biological relations, as well as an [[algebraic topology]] of the [[functional organization]] of living organisms in terms of their dynamic, complex [[Biological network|networks]] of metabolic, genetic, and [[epigenetic]] processes and [[signaling pathway]]s.&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite journal |last1=Rosen |first1=R. |date=1958a |title=A Relational Theory of Biological Systems |url= |journal=Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=245–60 |doi=10.1007/bf02478302}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite journal |last1=Rosen |first1=R. |date=1958b |title=The Representation of Biological Systems from the Standpoint of the Theory of Categories |url= |journal=Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=317–41 |doi=10.1007/bf02477890}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternative but closely related approaches focus on the interdependance of constraints, where constraints can be either molecular, such as enzymes, or macroscopic, such as the geometry of a bone or of the vascular system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Montévil |first=Maël |last2=Mossio |first2=Matteo |date=2015-05-07 |year= |title=Biological organisation as closure of constraints |url=https://www.academia.edu/11705712 |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=372 |pages=179–91 |doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2015.02.029 |pmid=25752259 |via= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171117143806/http://www.academia.edu/11705712/Biological_organisation_as_closure_of_constraints |archivedate=17 November 2017 |df=dmy-all |citeseerx=10.1.1.701.3373 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Darwinian dynamic====
It has also been argued that the evolution of order in living systems and certain physical systems obeys a common fundamental principle termed the Darwinian dynamic.&lt;ref name="Harris Bernstein, Henry C. Byerly, Frederick A. Hopf, Richard A. Michod and G. Krishna Vemulapalli 185"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Darwinian Dynamic |volume=58 |issue=2 |author1=Harris Bernstein |author2=Henry C.

The underlying order-generating process was concluded to be basically similar for both types of systems.&lt;ref name="Harris Bernstein, Henry C. Byerly, Frederick A. Hopf, Richard A. Michod and G. Krishna Vemulapalli 185"/&gt;

====Operator theory====
Another systemic definition called the operator theory proposes that "life is a general term for the presence of the typical closures found in organisms; the typical closures are a membrane and an autocatalytic set in the cell"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Pursuit of Complexity: The Utility of Biodiversity from an Evolutionary Perspective |last=Jagers |first=Gerard |publisher=KNNV Publishing |year=2012 |isbn=978-90-5011-443-1 |location= |pages= |quote= |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that an organism is any system with an organisation that complies with an operator type that is at least as complex as the cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Towards a Hierarchical Definition of Life, the Organism, and Death |journal=Foundations of Science |volume=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Explaining the Origin of Life is not Enough for a Definition of Life |journal=Foundations of Science |volume=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The role of logic and insight in the search for a definition of life |journal=J.

Some of the earliest theories of life were materialist, holding that all that exists is matter, and that life is merely a complex form or arrangement of matter. [[Empedocles]] (430 BC) argued that everything in the universe is made up of a combination of [[Classical element|four eternal "elements"]] or "roots of all": earth, water, air, and fire. All change is explained by the arrangement and rearrangement of these four elements. The various forms of life are caused by an appropriate mixture of elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Richard |last1=Parry |date=4 March 2005 |title=Empedocles |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/empedocles/ |accessdate=25 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Democritus]] (460 BC) thought that the essential characteristic of life is having a [[soul]] (''psyche''). Like other ancient writers, he was attempting to explain what makes something a ''living'' thing. His explanation was that fiery atoms make a soul in exactly the same way atoms and void account for any other thing. He elaborates on fire because of the apparent connection between life and heat, and because fire moves.&lt;ref name=democritus&gt;{{cite web |first1=Richard |last1=Parry |date=25 August 2010 |title=Democritus |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/democritus/#4 |accessdate=25 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic]] materialism that originated in ancient Greece was revived and revised by the French philosopher [[René Descartes]], who held that animals and humans were assemblages of parts that together functioned as a machine. In the 19th century, the advances in [[cell theory]] in biological science encouraged this view. The [[evolution]]ary theory of [[Charles Darwin]] (1859) is a mechanistic explanation for the origin of species by means of [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Paul |last1=Thagard |title=The Cognitive Science of Science: Explanation, Discovery, and Conceptual Change |publisher=MIT Press |date=2012 |isbn=978-0-262-01728-2 |pages=204–05 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HrJIV19_nZYC&amp;pg=PA204 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160903184310/https://books.google.com/books?id=HrJIV19_nZYC&amp;pg=PA204 |archivedate=3 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hylomorphism===
{{Main|Hylomorphism}}
[[File:Aristotelian Soul.png|thumb|upright=1.5|The [[Soul#Aristotle|structure of the souls]] of plants, animals, and humans, according to [[Aristotle]]]]
Hylomorphism is a theory first expressed by the Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] (322 BC). The application of hylomorphism to biology was important to Aristotle, and [[Aristotle's biology|biology is extensively covered in his extant writings]]. In this view, everything in the material universe has both matter and form, and the form of a living thing is its [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] (Greek ''psyche'', Latin ''anima''). There are three kinds of souls: the ''vegetative soul'' of plants, which causes them to grow and decay and nourish themselves, but does not cause motion and sensation; the ''animal soul'', which causes animals to move and feel; and the ''rational soul'', which is the source of consciousness and reasoning, which (Aristotle believed) is found only in man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=On the Soul |last=Aristotle |first= |publisher= |year= |isbn= |location= |pages=Book II |nopp=y |chapter= |quote= |via=|title-link=On the Soul }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each higher soul has all of the attributes of the lower ones. Aristotle believed that while matter can exist without form, form cannot exist without matter, and that therefore the soul cannot exist without the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Don |last1=Marietta |page=104 |title=Introduction to ancient philosophy |publisher=M.

This account is consistent with [[teleological]] explanations of life, which account for phenomena in terms of purpose or goal-directedness. Thus, the whiteness of the polar bear's coat is explained by its purpose of camouflage. The direction of causality (from the future to the past) is in contradiction with the scientific evidence for natural selection, which explains the consequence in terms of a prior cause. Biological features are explained not by looking at future optimal results, but by looking at the past [[evolutionary history]] of a species, which led to the natural selection of the features in question.&lt;ref name=stewert_williams2010&gt;{{Cite book |first1=Steve |last1=Stewart-Williams |date=2010 |title=Darwin, God and the meaning of life: how evolutionary theory undermines everything you thought you knew of life |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-76278-6 |pages=193–94 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KBp69los_-oC&amp;pg=PA193 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160903134432/https://books.google.com/books?id=KBp69los_-oC&amp;pg=PA193 |archivedate=3 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spontaneous generation ===
{{Main|Spontaneous generation}}
Spontaneous generation was the belief that living organisms can form without descent from similar organisms. Typically, the idea was that certain forms such as fleas could arise from inanimate matter such as dust or the supposed seasonal generation of mice and insects from mud or garbage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Origines Sacrae |last=Stillingfleet |first=Edward |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1697 |isbn= |location= |pages= |quote= |via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vitalism is the belief that the life-principle is non-material. This originated with [[Georg Ernst Stahl]] (17th century), and remained popular until the middle of the 19th century.

All known life forms share fundamental molecular mechanisms, reflecting their [[common descent]]; based on these observations, hypotheses on the origin of life attempt to find a mechanism explaining the formation of a [[universal common ancestor]], from simple [[organic molecule]]s via pre-cellular life to [[protocell]]s and metabolism. Models have been divided into "genes-first" and "metabolism-first" categories, but a recent trend is the emergence of hybrid models that combine both categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Coveney |first1=Peter V. |first2=Philip W. |last2=Fowler |title=Modelling biological complexity: a physical scientist's perspective |journal=Journal of the Royal Society Interface |date=2005 |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=267–80 |doi=10.1098/rsif.2005.0045|pmc=1578273 |pmid=16849185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no current [[scientific consensus]] as to how life originated. However, most accepted scientific models build on the [[Miller–Urey experiment]] and the work of [[Sidney W. Fox|Sidney Fox]], which show that conditions on the primitive Earth favored chemical reactions that synthesize [[amino acid]]s and other organic compounds from inorganic precursors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://phoenix.lpl.arizona.edu/mars145.php |title=Habitability and Biology: What are the Properties of Life? |accessdate=6 June 2013 |website=Phoenix Mars Mission |publisher=The University of Arizona |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140417155949/http://phoenix.lpl.arizona.edu/mars145.php |archivedate=17 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[phospholipid]]s spontaneously form [[lipid bilayer]]s, the basic structure of a [[cell membrane]].

Living organisms synthesize [[proteins]], which are [[polymer]]s of amino acids using instructions encoded by [[deoxyribonucleic acid]] (DNA). [[Protein synthesis]] entails intermediary [[ribonucleic acid]] (RNA) polymers. One possibility for how life began is that genes originated first, followed by proteins;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Senapathy |first1=Periannan |authorlink=Periannan Senapathy |title=Independent birth of organisms |location=Madison, Wisconsin |publisher=Genome Press |date=1994 |isbn=978-0-9641304-0-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3hJFAQAAIAAJ |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160905095531/https://books.google.com/books?id=3hJFAQAAIAAJ |archivedate=5 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the alternative being that proteins came first and then genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Eigen |first1=Manfred |first2=Ruthild |last2=Winkler |title=Steps towards life: a perspective on evolution (German edition, 1987) |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1992 |page=31 |isbn=978-0-19-854751-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Steps_towards_life.html?id=R7QTAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, because genes and proteins are both required to produce the other, the problem of considering which came first is like that of the [[chicken or the egg]]. Most scientists have adopted the hypothesis that because of this, it is unlikely that genes and proteins arose independently.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.usnews.com/science/articles/2009/05/13/how-rna-got-started-scientists-examine-the-origins-of-life |title=How RNA Got Started: Scientists Look for the Origins of Life |last=Barazesh |first=Solmaz |date=13 May 2009 |work=U.

Therefore, a possibility, first suggested by [[Francis Crick]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Watson |first1=James D. |title=Prologue: early speculations and facts about RNA templates |pages=xv–xxiii |work=The RNA World | editor1-first=R.

F. | editor2-last=Atkins |publisher=Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press |location=Cold Spring Harbor, New York |date=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; is that the first life was based on [[RNA]],&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; which has the DNA-like properties of information storage and the [[catalysis|catalytic]] properties of some proteins. This is called the [[RNA world hypothesis]], and it is supported by the observation that many of the most critical components of cells (those that [[Evolution|evolve]] the slowest) are composed mostly or entirely of RNA. Also, many critical cofactors ([[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], [[Acetyl-CoA]], [[NADH]], etc.) are either nucleotides or substances clearly related to them.

One issue with the RNA world hypothesis is that synthesis of RNA from simple inorganic precursors is more difficult than for other organic molecules. One reason for this is that RNA precursors are very stable and react with each other very slowly under ambient conditions, and it has also been proposed that living organisms consisted of other molecules before RNA.&lt;ref name=Cech&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cech |first1=T.R. |date=2011 |title=The RNA Worlds in Context |url= |journal=Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol |volume=4 |issue=7 |page= |doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a006742 |pmid=21441585 |pages=a006742 |pmc=3385955}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the successful synthesis of certain RNA molecules under the conditions that existed prior to life on Earth has been achieved by adding alternative precursors in a specified order with the precursor [[phosphate]] present throughout the reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Powner |first1=Matthew W. |first2=Béatrice |last2=Gerland |first3=John D. |last3=Sutherland |title=Synthesis of activated pyrimidine ribonucleotides in prebiotically plausible conditions |journal=Nature |volume=459 |pages=239–42 |date=14 May 2009 |doi=10.1038/nature08013 |pmid=19444213 |bibcode=2009Natur.459..239P |issue=7244}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study makes the RNA world hypothesis more plausible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Szostak |first1=Jack W. |title=Origins of life: Systems chemistry on early Earth |journal=Nature |volume=459 |pages=171–72 |date=14 May 2009 |doi=10.1038/459171a |bibcode=2009Natur.459..171S |issue=7244 |pmid=19444196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====DNA====
{{Main|DNA}}
Deoxyribonucleic acid is a [[molecule]] that carries most of the [[genetics|genetic]] instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and [[reproduction]] of all known living [[organism]]s and many viruses. DNA and [[RNA]] are [[nucleic acid]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s; alongside [[protein]]s and [[Polysaccharide|complex carbohydrates]], they are one of the three major types of [[macromolecules|macromolecule]] that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two [[biopolymer]] strands coiled around each other to form a [[Nucleic acid double helix|double helix]]. The two DNA strands are known as [[polynucleotide]]s since they are composed of [[monomer|simpler units]] called [[nucleotide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://basicbiology.net/micro/genetics/dna |title=DNA |date=5 February 2016 |website=Basic Biology |publisher= |access-date=15 November 2016 |last1=Purcell |first1=Adam |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170105045651/http://basicbiology.net/micro/genetics/dna/ |archivedate=5 January 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each nucleotide is composed of a [[nitrogenous base|nitrogen-containing]] [[nucleobase]]—either [[cytosine]] (C), [[guanine]] (G), [[adenine]] (A), or [[thymine]] (T)—as well as a [[monosaccharide|sugar]] called [[deoxyribose]] and a [[phosphate group]]. The nucleotides are joined to one another in a chain by [[covalent bond]]s between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next, resulting in an alternating [[backbone chain|sugar-phosphate backbone]]. According to [[base pair]]ing rules (A with T, and C with G), [[hydrogen bond]]s bind the nitrogenous bases of the two separate polynucleotide strands to make double-stranded DNA. The total amount of related DNA [[base pair]]s on Earth is estimated at 5.0 x 10&lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt;, and weighs 50 billion [[tonne]]s.&lt;ref name="NYT-20150718-rn"&gt;{{cite news |last=Nuwer |first=Rachel |date=18 July 2015 |title=Counting All the DNA on Earth |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/21/science/counting-all-the-dna-on-earth.html |work=The New York Times |location=New York |publisher=The New York Times Company |issn=0362-4331 |accessdate=2015-07-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150718153742/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/21/science/counting-all-the-dna-on-earth.html |archivedate=18 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--- PLOS paper cited by NYT used 'tonne' unit. ---&gt; In comparison, the total [[Biomass (ecology)|mass]] of the [[biosphere]] has been estimated to be as much as 4 [[tonnes#Derived units|TtC]] (trillion tons of [[carbon]]).&lt;ref name="AGCI-2015"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.agci.org/classroom/biosphere/index.php |title=The Biosphere: Diversity of Life |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Aspen Global Change Institute |location=Basalt, CO |accessdate=2015-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--- Aspen Global Change Institute (US-based) defined TtC as 'trillion tons of C'. ---&gt;

DNA stores biological information. The DNA backbone is resistant to cleavage, and both strands of the double-stranded structure store the same biological information. Biological information is replicated as the two strands are separated. A significant portion of DNA (more than 98% for humans) is [[non-coding DNA|non-coding]], meaning that these sections do not serve as patterns for protein sequences.

The two strands of DNA run in opposite directions to each other and are therefore [[antiparallel (biochemistry)|anti-parallel]]. Attached to each sugar is one of four types of nucleobases (informally, ''bases''). It is the [[Nucleic acid sequence|sequence]] of these four nucleobases along the backbone that encodes biological information. Under the [[genetic code]], [[RNA]] strands are translated to specify the sequence of [[amino acid]]s within proteins. These RNA strands are initially created using DNA strands as a template in a process called [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]].

Within cells, DNA is organized into long structures called [[chromosome]]s. During [[cell division]] these chromosomes are duplicated in the process of [[DNA replication]], providing each cell its own complete set of chromosomes. [[Eukaryote|Eukaryotic organisms]] (animals, plants, [[Fungus|fungi]], and [[protist]]s) store most of their DNA inside the [[cell nucleus]] and some of their DNA in [[organelle]]s, such as [[mitochondria]] or [[chloroplasts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Russell |first=Peter |title=iGenetics |publisher=Benjamin Cummings |location=New York |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-8053-4553-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[prokaryote]]s (bacteria and [[archaea]]) store their DNA only in the [[cytoplasm]]. Within the chromosomes, [[chromatin]] proteins such as [[histone]]s compact and organize DNA. These compact structures guide the interactions between DNA and other proteins, helping control which parts of the DNA are transcribed.

DNA was first isolated by [[Friedrich Miescher]] in 1869.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dahm R |title=Discovering DNA: Friedrich Miescher and the early years of nucleic acid research |journal=Hum.

==Classification==
{{Main|Biological classification}}
{{Biological classification}}
Life is usually classified by eight levels of taxa—domains, kingdoms, phyla, class, order, family, genus, and species. In May 2016, scientists reported that 1 trillion [[species]] are estimated to be on Earth currently with only one-thousandth of one percent described.&lt;ref name="NSF-2016002" /&gt;

The first known attempt to classify organisms was conducted by the Greek philosopher Aristotle (384–322 BC), who classified all living organisms known at that time as either a plant or an animal, based mainly on their ability to move. He also distinguished animals with blood from animals without blood (or at least without red blood), which can be compared with the concepts of [[vertebrate]]s and [[invertebrate]]s respectively, and divided the blooded animals into five groups: viviparous quadrupeds ([[mammal]]s), oviparous quadrupeds (reptiles and [[amphibian]]s), birds, fishes and [[Cetacea|whales]]. The bloodless animals were also divided into five groups: [[cephalopod]]s, [[crustacean]]s, insects (which included the spiders, [[scorpion]]s, and [[centipede]]s, in addition to what we define as insects today), shelled animals (such as most [[mollusc]]s and [[echinoderm]]s), and "[[zoophyte]]s" (animals that resemble plants). Though Aristotle's work in zoology was not without errors, it was the grandest biological synthesis of the time and remained the ultimate authority for many centuries after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/aristotle.html|title=Aristotle|last=|first=|date=|work=|publisher=University of California Museum of Paleontology|via=|accessdate=15 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161120124920/http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/aristotle.html|archivedate=20 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exploration of the Americas revealed large numbers of new plants and animals that needed descriptions and classification. In the latter part of the 16th century and the beginning of the 17th, careful study of animals commenced and was gradually extended until it formed a sufficient body of knowledge to serve as an anatomical basis for classification. In the late 1740s, [[Carl Linnaeus]] introduced his system of [[binomial nomenclature]] for the classification of species. Linnaeus attempted to improve the composition and reduce the length of the previously used many-worded names by abolishing unnecessary rhetoric, introducing new descriptive terms and precisely defining their meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Knapp S, Lamas G, Lughadha EN, Novarino G |title=Stability or stasis in the names of organisms: the evolving codes of nomenclature |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B]] |volume=359 |issue=1444 |pages=611–22 |date=April 2004 |pmid=15253348 |pmc=1693349 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2003.1445 |url=http://journals.royalsociety.org/openurl.asp?genre=article&amp;issn=0962-8436&amp;volume=359&amp;issue=1444&amp;spage=611}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fungi were originally treated as plants. For a short period Linnaeus had classified them in the taxon [[Vermes]] in Animalia, but later placed them back in Plantae. [[Herbert Copeland|Copeland]] classified the Fungi in his Protoctista, thus partially avoiding the problem but acknowledging their special status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The Kingdoms of Organisms |journal=Quarterly Review of Biology |volume=13|issue=4 |doi=10.1086/394568 |year=1938 |page=383 | last1 = Copeland | first1 = Herbert F.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem was eventually solved by [[Robert Whittaker|Whittaker]], when he gave them their own [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdom]] in his [[five-kingdom system]]. [[Evolutionary history of life|Evolutionary history]] shows that the fungi are more closely related to animals than to plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Whittaker |first1=R.

As new discoveries enabled detailed study of [[cell (biology)|cells]] and microorganisms, new groups of life were revealed, and the fields of [[cell biology]] and [[microbiology]] were created. These new organisms were originally described separately in [[protozoa]] as animals and [[thallophyte|protophyta/thallophyta]] as plants, but were united by [[Ernst Haeckel|Haeckel]] in the kingdom [[Protista]]; later, the [[prokaryote]]s were split off in the kingdom [[Monera]], which would eventually be divided into two separate groups, the Bacteria and the [[Archaea]]. This led to the [[six-kingdom system]] and eventually to the current [[three-domain system]], which is based on evolutionary relationships.&lt;ref name="Woese1990"/&gt; However, the classification of eukaryotes, especially of protists, is still controversial.&lt;ref name="Adl 05"&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Adl SM, Simpson AG, Farmer MA, etal |title=The new higher level classification of eukaryotes with emphasis on the taxonomy of protists |journal=J.

As microbiology, [[molecular biology]] and [[virology]] developed, non-cellular reproducing agents were discovered, such as viruses and [[viroid]]s. Whether these are considered alive has been a matter of debate; viruses lack characteristics of life such as cell membranes, metabolism and the ability to grow or respond to their environments. Viruses can still be classed into "species" based on their biology and [[genetics]], but many aspects of such a classification remain controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Van Regenmortel MH |title=Virus species and virus identification: past and current controversies |journal=Infection, Genetics and Evolution |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=133–44 |date=January 2007 |pmid=16713373 |doi=10.1016/j.meegid.2006.04.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s a trend called [[cladistics]] emerged, arranging [[taxa]] based on [[clade]]s in an [[phylogenetic tree|evolutionary or phylogenetic tree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Pennisi E |title=Taxonomy.

There are two primary types of cells. [[Prokaryote]]s lack a [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] and other membrane-bound [[organelle]]s, although they have circular DNA and [[ribosome]]s. Bacteria and [[Archaea]] are two [[domain (biology)|domains]] of prokaryotes. The other primary type of cells are the [[eukaryote]]s, which have distinct nuclei bound by a nuclear membrane and membrane-bound organelles, including [[mitochondria]], [[chloroplasts]], [[lysosomes]], rough and smooth [[endoplasmic reticulum]], and [[vacuoles]]. In addition, they possess organized chromosomes that store genetic material. All species of large complex organisms are eukaryotes, including animals, plants and fungi, though most species of eukaryote are [[protist]] [[microorganism]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Whitman |first1=W. |last2=Coleman |first2=D. |last3=Wiebe |first3=W. |title=Prokaryotes: The unseen majority |doi=10.1073/pnas.95.12.6578 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=95 |issue=12 |pages=6578–83 |date=1998 |pmid=9618454 |pmc=33863 |bibcode=1998PNAS...95.6578W}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conventional model is that eukaryotes evolved from prokaryotes, with the main organelles of the eukaryotes forming through [[endosymbiosis]] between bacteria and the progenitor eukaryotic cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Norman R. |last1=Pace |title=Concept Time for a change |journal=Nature |volume=441 |page=289 |date=18 May 2006 |doi=10.1038/441289a |url=http://coursesite.uhcl.edu/NAS/Kang/BIOL3231/Week3-Pace_2006.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68GROFAbU?url=http://coursesite.uhcl.edu/NAS/Kang/BIOL3231/Week3-Pace_2006.pdf |archivedate=8 June 2012 |accessdate=2 June 2012 |pmid=16710401 |bibcode=2006Natur.441..289P |issue=7091}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The molecular mechanisms of [[cell biology]] are based on [[protein]]s. Most of these are synthesized by the ribosomes through an [[Enzyme catalysis|enzyme-catalyzed]] process called [[protein biosynthesis]]. A sequence of amino acids is assembled and joined together based upon [[gene expression]] of the cell's nucleic acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Scientific background |website=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2009 |publisher=Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2009/advanced.html |accessdate=10 June 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402150754/http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2009/advanced.html |archivedate=2 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In eukaryotic cells, these proteins may then be transported and processed through the [[Golgi apparatus]] in preparation for dispatch to their destination.&lt;ref name="pmid20605430"&gt;{{cite journal |year=2010 |title=Passage through the Golgi |journal=Curr Opin Cell Biol |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=471–78 |doi=10.1016/j.ceb.2010.05.003 |pmid=20605430 |vauthors=Nakano A, Luini A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cells reproduce through a process of [[cell division]] in which the parent cell divides into two or more daughter cells. For prokaryotes, cell division occurs through a process of [[Fission (biology)|fission]] in which the DNA is replicated, then the two copies are attached to parts of the cell membrane. In [[eukaryote]]s, a more complex process of [[mitosis]] is followed. However, the end result is the same; the resulting cell copies are identical to each other and to the original cell (except for [[mutations]]), and both are capable of further division following an [[interphase]] period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Joseph |last1=Panno |title=The Cell |series=Facts on File science library |publisher=Infobase Publishing |date=2004 |isbn=978-0-8160-6736-7 |pages=60–70 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sYgKY6zz20YC&amp;pg=PA60 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160904151747/https://books.google.com/books?id=sYgKY6zz20YC&amp;pg=PA60 |archivedate=4 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Multicellular organism]]s may have first evolved through the formation of [[Colony (biology)|colonies]] of identical cells. These cells can form group organisms through [[cell adhesion]]. The individual members of a colony are capable of surviving on their own, whereas the members of a true multi-cellular organism have developed specializations, making them dependent on the remainder of the organism for survival. Such organisms are formed [[Clone (cell biology)|clonally]] or from a single [[germ cell]] that is capable of forming the various specialized cells that form the adult organism. This specialization allows multicellular organisms to exploit resources more efficiently than single cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |display-authors=1 |first1=Bruce |last1=Alberts |first2=Dennis |last2=Bray |first3=Julian |last3=Lewis |first4=Martin |last4=Raff |first5=Keith |last5=Roberts |first6=James D. |last6=Watson |chapter=From Single Cells to Multicellular Organisms |title=Molecular Biology of the Cell |edition=3rd |location=New York |publisher=Garland Science |date=1994 |isbn=978-0-8153-1620-6 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK28332/ |accessdate=12 June 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306165115/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK28332/ |archivedate=6 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2016, scientists reported that, [[Timeline of the evolutionary history of life|about 800 million years ago]], a [[Evolutionary developmental biology|minor genetic change]] in a single [[molecule]], called GK-PID, may have allowed [[organism]]s to go from a [[Unicellular organism|single cell organism]] to [[Multicellular organism|one of many cells]].&lt;ref name="NYT-20160107"&gt;{{cite news |last=Zimmer |first=Carl |authorlink=Carl Zimmer |title=Genetic Flip Helped Organisms Go From One Cell to Many |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/12/science/genetic-flip-helped-organisms-go-from-one-cell-to-many.html |date=7 January 2016 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=7 January 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107204432/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/12/science/genetic-flip-helped-organisms-go-from-one-cell-to-many.html |archivedate=7 January 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cells have evolved methods to perceive and respond to their microenvironment, thereby enhancing their adaptability. [[Cell signaling]] coordinates cellular activities, and hence governs the basic functions of multicellular organisms. Signaling between cells can occur through direct cell contact using [[juxtacrine signalling]], or indirectly through the exchange of agents as in the [[endocrine system]]. In more complex organisms, coordination of activities can occur through a dedicated [[nervous system]].&lt;ref name=alberts2002&gt;{{cite book |display-authors=1 |first1=Bruce |last1=Alberts |first2=Alexander |last2=Johnson |first3=Julian |last3=Lewis |first4=Martin |last4=Raff |first5=Keith |last5=Roberts |first6=Peter |last6=Walter |chapter=General Principles of Cell Communication |title=Molecular Biology of the Cell |location=New York |publisher=Garland Science |date=2002 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26813/ |accessdate=12 June 2012 |isbn=978-0-8153-3218-3 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904000612/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26813/ |archivedate=4 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond the Solar System, the region around another [[main sequence|main-sequence star]] that could support Earth-like life on an Earth-like planet is known as the [[habitable zone]]. The inner and outer radii of this zone vary with the luminosity of the star, as does the time interval during which the zone survives. Stars more massive than the Sun have a larger habitable zone, but remain on the Sun-like "main sequence" of [[stellar evolution]] for a shorter time interval. Small [[red dwarf]]s have the opposite problem, with a smaller habitable zone that is subject to higher levels of magnetic activity and the effects of [[tidal locking]] from close orbits. Hence, stars in the intermediate mass range such as the Sun may have a greater likelihood for Earth-like life to develop.&lt;ref name=selis2006&gt;{{Cite book |first1=Frank |last1=Selis |date=2006 |chapter=Habitability: the point of view of an astronomer |title=Lectures in Astrobiology |volume=2 |editor1-first=Muriel |editor1-last=Gargaud |editor2-first=Hervé |editor2-last=Martin |editor3-first=Philippe |editor3-last=Claeys |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-540-33692-1 |pages=210–14 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3uYmP0K5PXEC&amp;pg=PA210 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160903233938/https://books.google.com/books?id=3uYmP0K5PXEC&amp;pg=PA210 |archivedate=3 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The location of the star within a galaxy may also affect the likelihood of life forming.

After death, the remains of an organism re-enter the [[biogeochemical cycle]]. Organisms may be [[necrophagy|consumed]] by a [[predator]] or a [[scavenger]] and leftover [[organic material]] may then be further decomposed by [[detritivore]]s, organisms that recycle [[detritus]], returning it to the environment for reuse in the [[food chain]].

One of the challenges in defining death is in distinguishing it from life. Death would seem to refer to either the moment life ends, or when the state that follows life begins.&lt;ref name=define_death/&gt; However, determining when death has occurred is difficult, as cessation of life functions is often not simultaneous across organ systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |title=Crossing Over: How Science Is Redefining Life and Death |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2016/04/dying-death-brain-dead-body-consciousness-science/ |author=Henig, Robin Marantz |authorlink=Robin Marantz Henig |publisher=''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' |date=April 2016 |accessdate=23 October 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171101071129/https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2016/04/dying-death-brain-dead-body-consciousness-science/ |archivedate=1 November 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such determination therefore requires drawing conceptual lines between life and death. This is problematic, however, because there is little consensus over how to define life. The nature of death has for millennia been a central concern of the world's religious traditions and of philosophical inquiry. Many religions maintain faith in either a kind of [[afterlife]] or [[reincarnation]] for the [[soul]], or [[resurrection]] of the body at a later date.

===Extinction===
{{Main|Extinction}}
Extinction is the process by which a group of [[taxa]] or [[species]] dies out, reducing biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Extinction&amp;nbsp;– definition |url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861609974/extinction.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwseRB80?url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861609974/extinction.html |archivedate=1 November 2009 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The moment of extinction is generally considered the death of the last individual of that species. Because a species' potential [[range (biology)|range]] may be very large, determining this moment is difficult, and is usually done retrospectively after a period of apparent absence. Species become extinct when they are no longer able to survive in changing [[habitat]] or against superior competition. In [[History of the Earth|Earth's history]], over 99% of all the species that have ever lived are extinct;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://palaeo.gly.bris.ac.uk/Palaeofiles/Triassic/extinction.htm |title=What is an extinction? |website=Late Triassic |publisher=Bristol University |accessdate=27 June 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901011807/http://palaeo.gly.bris.ac.uk/palaeofiles/triassic/extinction.htm |archivedate=1 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Book-Biology"&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Kunin, W.E. |editor2=Gaston, Kevin |title=The Biology of Rarity: Causes and consequences of rare—common differences |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4LHnCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA110&amp;lpg=PA110&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |date=31 December 1996 |isbn=978-0-412-63380-5 |accessdate=26 May 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905164104/https://books.google.com/books?id=4LHnCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA110&amp;lpg=PA110&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |archivedate=5 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="StearnsStearns2000"&gt;{{cite book |last=Stearns |first=Beverly Peterson |last2=Stearns |first2=S.

===Fossils===
{{Main|Fossils}}
Fossils are the preserved remains or [[trace fossil|traces]] of animals, plants, and other organisms from the remote past. The totality of fossils, both discovered and undiscovered, and their placement in fossil-containing [[rock (geology)|rock]] formations and [[sedimentary rock|sedimentary]] layers ([[stratum|strata]]) is known as the ''fossil record''. A preserved specimen is called a fossil if it is older than the arbitrary date of 10,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdnhm.org/science/paleontology/resources/frequent/|title=Frequently Asked Questions|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=San Diego Natural History Museum|accessdate=25 May 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510101706/http://sdnhm.org/science/paleontology/resources/frequent/|archivedate=10 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, fossils range in age from the youngest at the start of the [[Holocene]] Epoch to the oldest from the [[Archean|Archaean]] Eon, up to 3.4 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Brian |last1=Vastag |title=Oldest 'microfossils' raise hopes for life on Mars |date=21 August 2011 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/oldest-microfossils-hail-from-34-billion-years-ago-raise-hopes-for-life-on-mars/2011/08/19/gIQAHK8UUJ_story.html?hpid=z3 |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=21 August 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019000458/http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/oldest-microfossils-hail-from-34-billion-years-ago-raise-hopes-for-life-on-mars/2011/08/19/gIQAHK8UUJ_story.html?hpid=z3 |archivedate=19 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nicholas |last=Wade |title=Geological Team Lays Claim to Oldest Known Fossils |date=21 August 2011 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/22/science/earth/22fossil.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;src=ig |work=The New York Times |accessdate=21 August 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501085118/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/22/science/earth/22fossil.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;src=ig |archivedate=1 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="46776">The survival of some [[microorganisms]] exposed to [[outer space]] has been studied using both simulated facilities and [[low Earth orbit]] exposures. Bacteria were some of the first organisms investigated, when in 1960 a Russian satellite carried ''Escherichia coli'', ''Staphylococcus'', and ''Enterobacter aerogenes'' into orbit.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.indy100.com/article/bacteria-get-dangerously-weird-in-space-7380481| title=Bacteria get dangerously weird in space| last=Love| first=Shayla|date=2016-10-26| newspaper=The Independent| access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of microorganisms have been selected for exposure experiments since, as listed in the table below.

Experiments of the adaption of microbes in space have yielded unpredictable results. While sometimes the microorganism may weaken, they can also increase in their disease-causing potency.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

It is possible to classify these microorganisms into two groups, the [[Medical microbiology|human-borne]], and the [[extremophiles]]. Studying the human-borne microorganisms is significant for human welfare and future [[Human spaceflight|crewed missions in space]], whilst the extremophiles are vital for studying the physiological requirements of survival in space.&lt;ref name='Experimental methods'&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; NASA has pointed out that normal adults have ten times as many microbial cells as human cells in their bodies.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/microorganisms.html NASA – Spaceflight Alters Bacterial Social Networks (2013)]&lt;/ref&gt; They are also nearly everywhere in the environment, and although normally invisible, can form slimy biofilms.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

Extremophiles have adapted to live in some of the most extreme environments on Earth. This includes [[hypersaline lake]]s, [[desert|arid regions]], [[deep sea]], acidic sites, cold and dry polar regions and [[permafrost]].&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of extremophiles has led to the speculation that microorganisms could survive the harsh conditions of extraterrestrial environments and be used as model organisms to understand the fate of biological systems in these environments. The focus of many of the experiments has been to investigate the possible survival of organisms inside rocks ([[lithopanspermia]]),&lt;ref name='Experimental methods'/&gt; or their survival on [[Mars]] for understanding the likelihood of past or present life on that planet.&lt;ref name='Experimental methods'/&gt;  Because of their ubiquity and resistance to spacecraft decontamination, bacterial [[spore]]s are considered likely potential [[Planetary protection|forward contaminants]] on robotic missions to [[Mars]].  Measuring the resistance of such organisms to space conditions can be applied to develop adequate decontamination procedures.&lt;ref&gt;

Research and testing of microorganisms in outer space could eventually be applied for [[directed panspermia]] or [[terraforming]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6970">This is a list of people claimed to be [[immortality|immortal]]. This list does not reference purely spiritual entities ([[spirit]]s, [[deity|gods]], [[demon]]s, [[angel]]s), non-humans ([[monster]]s, [[extraterrestrials in fiction|alien]]s, [[elf|elves]]), or artificial life ([[artificial intelligence]], [[robot]]s).

This list comprises people claimed to achieve a deathless existence on Earth.  This list does not contain those people who are supposed to have attained immortality through the typical means of a religion, such as a [[Christian]] in [[Heaven]].  It also does not include people whose immortality involves living in a place not on Earth, such as [[Heracles]] on [[Mount Olympus]]&lt;ref&gt;While Mount Olympus actually exists, the Greeks understood a distinction between the Olympus of the Gods and the part that could be seen by humans. See {{citation | last=Dudley | first=John | year=1846 | title=Naology: or, A treatise on the origin, progress, and symbolical import of the sacred structures of the most eminent nations and ages of the world | publisher=F. and J. Rivington | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UHAAAAAAMAAJ | page=22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Eight Immortals]] of [[Taoism]] in [[Mount Penglai]].  It also does not include people who, according to their religion, became deities or actually were deities the whole time, such as [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]] (who as part of the [[Trinity]] was, according to Christianity, also [[God in Christianity|God]]) or [[Parashurama]] according to [[Hindu]] mythology. &lt;!--in [[Mount Meru (mythology)|Mount Meru]]--&gt;

These listings are in chronological order, though some dates are approximate.

* Nicolas Flamel. He is believed to find the book of Abraham the mage, get the ever-changing text decoded and find a spell for immortality, along with his wife.

* [[Ziusudra]] (also Zi-ud-sura and Zin-Suddu; Hellenized Xisuthros: "found long life" or "life of long days") of Shuruppak is listed in the WB-62 Sumerian king list{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} recension as the last king of Sumer prior to the deluge. He is subsequently recorded as the hero of the Sumerian flood epic. He is also mentioned in other ancient literature, including The Death of Gilgamesh{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} and The Poem of Early Rulers,{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} and a late version of The Instructions of Shuruppak refers to Ziusudra. [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] [[Atrahasis]] ("extremely wise") and [[Utnapishtim]] ("he found life"), as well as biblical [[Noah]] ("rest") are similar heroes of [[flood legend]]s of the [[Ancient Near East]].&lt;ref&gt;Transliteration from "The Flood Tablet" Tablet 256/Block 7 in The British Museum: ti digir-gin7 mu-un-na-sum-mu | zi da-ri2 digir-gin7 mu-un&lt;na&gt;-ab-e11-de3 (They brought down to him eternal life.

* [[Ashwatthama|Ashwathama]] the [[Kaurava]] warrior after the  [[Kurukshetra War|kurukshetra]] was cursed by [[Krishna]] 'to be immortal and roam the earth without love, respect and social acceptance from anyone until the end of time'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://haribhakt.com/aswathama-existed-ashwathama-seen-by-people-ashwathama-is-alive/|title=Aswathama Exists – Ashwathama Seen By People – Ashwathama Is Alive {{!}} Radhe Radhe {{!}} HariBhakt.com|website=haribhakt.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Tithonus]], who in [[Greek mythology]] was granted eternal life but not eternal youth.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}
* [[Achilles]], [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], [[Ino (Greek mythology)|Ino]], [[Memnon (mythology)|Memnon]], [[Menelaus]], and [[Peleus]], were said to have achieved physical immortality through the intervention of the gods.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dag Øistein Endsjø]]. ''Greek Resurrection Beliefs and the Success of Christianity.'' New York: Palgrave Macmillan 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Wandering Jew]] (b. 1st century BC), a Jewish shoemaker.  According to legend, he taunted Jesus on his way to [[crucifixion]]. Jesus cursed him to "go on forever till I return." Thus, the Wandering Jew is to live until the [[Second Coming|second coming of Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;http://ebooks.unibuc.ro/filologie/hebra/2-5.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[John the Apostle]] (AD 6-101), one of Jesus's followers.  Some [[Mormons]], in conjunction with their own scriptures, interpret the biblical scripture found at John 21:21-23 to mean that John will ''tarry'' or remain on the earth until the [[Second Coming]].&lt;ref&gt;The Immortal by JJ Dewey&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Three Nephites]] (between AD 34 and 35), three men described in the [[Book of Mormon]] who are given power over death in order to fulfill their desire to minister among men until Jesus comes again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/3_ne/28 3 Nephi 28&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Galahad|Sir Galahad]] (dates for his life fall between the 2nd century and the 6th century), one of the three [[Matter of Britain|Arthurian]] knights to find the [[Holy Grail]].  Of them, Galahad is the only one to have achieved immortality by it.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}
* [[Merlin]] (dates for his life fall between the 2nd century and the 6th century); in some accounts, Merlin is trapped by an [[Incantation|enchantment]] by [[Nimue]], and while some end with Merlin dying, in others he remains in the trap (variously a tomb, a cave, a mist, or a tree) indefinitely.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}
* [[Cain and Abel|Cain]], the world's first murder, cursed with immortality for his crime
* [[Matiu Turipa]] , (dates his life in 18th century) Was Cursed to live forever, To never pass on by the Maori God's at the age of 20, for his betrayal of his people.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

==Failed quests for immortality==
* [[Gilgamesh]] (possibly reigned during the [[26th century BC]]) after the death of his companion, [[Enkidu]], Gilgamesh pursues immortality to avoid Enkidu's fate. Gilgamesh fails two tests and does not become immortal, realising instead that mortals attain immortality through lasting works of civilization and [[culture]].  [[Epic of Gilgamesh|Gilgamesh's story]] is among the [[ancient literature|oldest stories recorded]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}
* [[Qin Shi Huang]], the First [[Emperor of China]] who reigned during 259 BC–210 BC, also sought immortality in his old age. Twice he sent hundreds of people under the direction of [[Xu Fu]] to find the legendary [[elixir of life]], but failed. He died of [[mercury poisoning]] after he had eaten too many mercury pills, prescribed by his court doctors to make him immortal.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

[[File:Paul Gauguin - D'ou venons-nous.jpg|thumb|380px|''[[Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?]]'', one of [[Post-Impressionist]] [[Paul Gauguin]]'s most famous paintings]]

The '''meaning of life''', or the '''answer to the question "What is the meaning of life?"''', pertains to the [[intrinsic value (ethics)|significance]] of [[Life|living]] or [[existence]] in general. Many other related questions include: "Why are we here?", "What is life all about?", or "What is the purpose of existence?" There have been a large number of proposed answers to these questions from many different [[cultural]] and [[ideological]] backgrounds. The search for life's meaning has produced much [[philosophical]], [[scientific]], [[theological]], and [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] speculation throughout history. Different people and cultures believe different things for the answer to this question. 

The meaning of life as we perceive it is derived from philosophical and religious contemplation of, and scientific inquiries about [[existence]], [[social ties]], [[consciousness]], and [[happiness]].  Many other issues are also involved, such as [[linguistic meaning|symbolic meaning]], [[ontology]], [[value (philosophy)|value]], [[Teleology|purpose]], [[ethics]], [[good and evil]], [[free will]], the [[Existence of God|existence of one or multiple gods]], [[conceptions of God]], the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], and the [[afterlife]]. Scientific contributions focus primarily on describing related [[empiricism|empirical]] [[fact]]s about the [[universe]], exploring the context and parameters concerning the "how" of life. Science also studies and can provide recommendations for the [[positive psychology|pursuit of well-being]] and a related [[science of morality|conception of morality]]. An alternative, [[humanistic]] approach poses the question, "What is the meaning of ''my'' life?"

These questions have resulted in a wide range of competing answers and arguments, from [[scientific]] theories, to [[philosophical]], [[theological]], and [[spirituality|spiritual]] explanations.

==Scientific inquiry and perspectives==
{{Further information|Eudaimonia#Eudaimonia and modern psychology|Meaningful Life}}
&lt;!--Please do not include single-scientific-theory specific entries in this section. Thank you.--&gt;

Many members of the [[scientific community]] and [[philosophy of science]] communities think that science can provide the relevant context, and set of parameters necessary for dealing with topics related to the meaning of life. In their view, science can offer a wide range of insights on topics ranging from the [[Positive psychology|science of happiness]] to [[Terror management theory|death anxiety]]. Scientific inquiry facilitates this through nomological investigation into various   aspects of [[life]] and [[reality]], such as the [[Big Bang]], [[Abiogenesis|the origin of life]], and [[evolution]], and by studying the objective factors which correlate with the subjective experience of meaning and happiness.

===Psychological significance and value in life===
Researchers in [[positive psychology]] study empirical factors that lead to life satisfaction,&lt;ref&gt;E. Diener, J.J. Sapyta, E. Suh (1998). "Subjective Well-Being Is Essential to Well-Being." ''Psychological Inquiry'', Lawrence Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt; full [[flow (psychology)|engagement]] in activities,&lt;ref name="Csíkszentmihályi, Mihály 1990"&gt;Csíkszentmihályi, Mihály (1990). ''Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience''. New York: Harper and Row. {{ISBN|0060920432}}.&lt;/ref&gt; making a fuller contribution by utilizing one's personal strengths,&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, Christopher; Seligman, Martin (2004). ''Character strengths and virtues: A handbook and classification''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0195167015}}. {{cite web |title=See brief summary |url=http://www.meaningandhappiness.com/psychology-research/list-of-personal-strengths.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and meaning based on investing in something larger than the self.&lt;ref&gt;Seligman, M.E.P. (2002). ''Authentic Happiness: Using the New Positive Psychology to Realize Your Potential for Lasting Fulfillment.'' New York: Free Press. {{ISBN|0743222970}} (Paperback edition, 2004, Free Press, {{ISBN|0743222989}})&lt;/ref&gt;  Large-data studies of [[flow (psychology)|flow]] experiences have consistently suggested that humans experience meaning and fulfillment when mastering challenging tasks, and that the experience comes from the way tasks are approached and performed rather than the particular choice of task.  For example, flow experiences can be obtained by prisoners in concentration camps with minimal facilities, and occur only slightly more often in billionaires.  A classic example&lt;ref name="Csíkszentmihályi, Mihály 1990"/&gt; is of two workers on an apparently boring production line in a factory.  One treats the work as a tedious chore while the other turns it into a game to see how fast she can make each unit, and achieves flow in the process.

[[Neuroscience]] describes [[reward system|reward]], [[pleasure]], and [[motivation]] in terms of neurotransmitter activity, especially in the [[limbic system]] and the [[ventral tegmental area]] in particular. If one believes that the meaning of life is to maximize pleasure and to ease general life, then this allows normative predictions about how to act to achieve this. Likewise, some ethical naturalists advocate a [[science of morality]]—the empirical pursuit of flourishing for all conscious creatures.

[[Experimental philosophy]] and [[neuroethics]] research collects data about human ethical decisions in controlled scenarios such as [[trolley problems]].  It has shown that many types of ethical judgment are universal across cultures, suggesting that they may be innate, whilst others are culture specific.  The findings show actual human ethical reasoning to be at odds with most logical philosophical theories, for example consistently showing distinctions between action by cause and action by omission which would be absent from utility based theories.   Cognitive science has theorized about differences between conservative and liberal ethics and how they may be based on different metaphors from family life such as strong fathers vs nurturing mother models.

[[Neurotheology]] is a controversial field which tries to find neural correlates and mechanisms of religious experience.  Some researchers have suggested that the human brain has innate mechanisms for such experiences and that living without using them for their evolved purposes may be a cause of imbalance.  Studies have reported conflicted results on correlating happiness with religious belief and it is difficult to find unbiased meta-analyses.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

[[Sociology]] examines value at a social level using theoretical constructs such as [[Value theory#Sociology|value theory]], norms, [[anomie]], etc.   One value system suggested by [[social psychology (psychology)|social psychologists]], broadly called [[Terror Management Theory]], states that human meaning is derived from a fundamental fear of death, and values are selected when they allow us to escape the mental reminder of death.

Emerging research shows that meaning in life predicts better physical health outcomes. Greater meaning has been associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Boyle PA, Buchman AS, Barnes LL, Bennett DA. Effect of a purpose in life on risk of incident Alzheimer disease and mild cognitive impairment in community-dwelling older persons.

Purpose in life and reduced incidence of stroke in older adults: The Health and Retirement Study.

Purpose in life is associated with mortality among community-dwelling older persons. Psychosomatic Medicine. 2009;71:574–579.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014, the British [[National Health Service]] began recommending a five step plan for mental well-being based on meaningful lives, whose steps are:  (1) Connect with community and family; (2) Physical exercise; (3) Lifelong learning; (4) Giving to others; (5) [[Mindfulness]] of the world around you.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/Pages/improve-mental-wellbeing.aspx|title=Five steps to mental wellbeing|work=www.nhs.uk|date=2017-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origin and nature of biological life===
[[File:DNA Overview.png|thumb|left|[[DNA]], the molecule containing the genetic instructions for the development and functioning of all known [[life|living organisms]].]]
The exact mechanisms of [[abiogenesis]] are unknown: notable hypotheses include the [[RNA world hypothesis]] (RNA-based replicators) and the [[iron-sulfur world hypothesis]] (metabolism without genetics). The process by which different lifeforms have developed throughout history via [[gene]]tic [[mutation]] and [[natural selection]] is explained by [[evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Darwin]] (1859). ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the 20th century, based upon insight gleaned from the [[gene-centered view of evolution]], biologists [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]], [[Richard Dawkins]], and [[David Haig (biologist)|David Haig]], among others, concluded that if there is a primary function to life, it is the replication of DNA and the survival of one's genes.&lt;ref name="Dawkins selfish gene"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Richard Dawkins |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |title=The Selfish Gene |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1976 |isbn=978-0198575191|title-link=The Selfish Gene }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dawkins river"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Richard Dawkins |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |title=River out of Eden |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |date=1995 |isbn=978-0465069903|title-link=River out of Eden }}&lt;/ref&gt; This view has not achieved universal agreement; [[Jeremy Griffith]] is a notable exception, maintaining that the meaning of life is to be integrative.&lt;ref name="worldtransformation.com"&gt;{{cite book |author=Griffith J. |year=2012 |chapter=What is the Meaning of Life? |title=The Book of Real Answers to Everything! |isbn=978-1741290073 |chapter-url=http://www.worldtransformation.com/what-is-the-meaning-of-life/ |accessdate=2012-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Responding to an interview question from Richard Dawkins about "what it is all for", [[James Watson]] stated "I don't think we're ''for'' anything. We're just the products of evolution."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The God Delusion|last = Dawkins|first = Richard|publisher = Houghton Mifflin|date = 2006|isbn = 978-0618680009|location = |pages = 99–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though scientists have intensively studied [[organism|life on Earth]], defining [[life]] in unequivocal terms is still a challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astrobio.net/news/article226 |title=Complete Archive for Astrobiology Press Release, News Exclusive, News Briefs |work=Astrobiology Magazine |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013130816/http://www.astrobio.net/news/article226 |archivedate=13 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbi.dk/~emmeche/cePubl/97e.defLife.v3f.html|title=Defining Life, Explaining Emergence|work=nbi.dk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physically, one may say that life "feeds on [[negentropy|negative entropy]]"&lt;ref name="worldtransformation.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Schrödinger |first=Erwin |title=What is Life? |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=1944 |isbn=978-0521427081}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Margulis |first=Lynn |author2=Sagan, Dorion |title=What is Life? |publisher=University of California Press |date=1995 |isbn=978-0520220218}}&lt;/ref&gt; which refers to the process by which living entities decrease their internal [[entropy]] at the expense of some form of [[energy]] taken in from the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Lovelock |first=James |title=Gaia – a New Look at Life on Earth |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2000 |isbn=978-0192862181}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Avery |first=John |title=Information Theory and Evolution |publisher=World Scientific |date=2003 |isbn=978-9812383990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biologists generally agree that lifeforms are [[self-organization|self-organizing]] systems [[homeostasis|which regulate their internal environments as to maintain this organized state]], [[metabolism]] serves to provide energy, and [[reproduction]] causes life to continue over a span of multiple generations. Typically, organisms are responsive to stimuli and genetic information changes from generation to generation, resulting in adaptation through evolution; this optimizes the chances of survival for the individual organism and its descendants respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.una.edu/pdavis/BI%20101/Overview%20Fall%202004.htm |title=How to Define Life |accessdate=2008-10-17 |last=Davison |first=Paul G. |publisher=The University of North  Alabama |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081101024755/http://www2.una.edu/pdavis/BI%20101/Overview%20Fall%202004.htm |archivedate=1 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-cellular replicating agents, notably [[virus]]es, are generally not considered to be organisms because they are incapable of independent reproduction or metabolism. This classification is problematic, though, since some [[parasite]]s and [[endosymbiont]]s are also incapable of independent life. [[Astrobiology]] studies the possibility of different forms of life on other worlds, including replicating structures made from materials other than DNA.

===Origins and ultimate fate of the universe===
[[File:CMB Timeline300 no WMAP.jpg|thumb|The [[metric expansion of space]]. The [[inflationary epoch]] is the expansion of the [[metric tensor]] at left.]]

Though the [[Big Bang]] theory was met with much skepticism when first introduced, it has become well-supported by several independent observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Helge Kragh |title=Cosmology and Controversy |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=1996 |isbn=978-0691005461}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, current physics can only describe the early universe from 10&lt;sup&gt;−43&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang (where zero time corresponds to infinite temperature); a theory of [[quantum gravity]] would be required to understand events before that time. Nevertheless, many physicists have speculated about what would have preceded this limit, and how the universe came into being.&lt;ref name="Prantzos &amp; Lyle"&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Nikos Prantzos |author2=Stephen Lyle |title= Our Cosmic Future: Humanity's Fate in the Universe |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2000 |isbn=978-0521770989}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one interpretation is that the Big Bang occurred coincidentally, and when considering the [[anthropic principle]], it is sometimes interpreted as implying the existence of a [[multiverse]].&lt;ref name="Edwards"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Rem B. Edwards |title=What Caused the Big Bang? |publisher=Rodopi |date=2001 |isbn=978-9042014077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ultimate fate of the universe, and implicitly humanity, is hypothesized as one in which biological life will eventually become unsustainable, such as through a [[Big Freeze]], [[Big Rip]], or [[Big Crunch]].

Theoretical [[cosmology]] studies many alternative speculative models for the origin and fate of the universe beyond the big bang theory.   A recent trend has been models of the creation of 'baby universes' inside [[black holes]], with our own [[big bang]] being a [[white hole]] on the inside of a [[black hole]] in another parent universe.&lt;ref name="Poplawski"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Radial motion into an Einstein-Rosen bridge, Physics Letters B | first=Nikodem J. |last=Poplawski |volume=687 | date=April 2010 |pages=110–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Multiverse]] theories claim that every possibility of [[quantum mechanics]] is played out in parallel universes.

===Scientific questions about the mind===
The nature and origin of [[consciousness]] and the [[mind]] itself are also widely debated in science. The [[explanatory gap]] is generally equated with the [[hard problem of consciousness]], and the question of [[free will]] is also considered to be of fundamental importance. These subjects are mostly addressed in the fields of [[cognitive science]], [[neuroscience]] (e.g. the [[neuroscience of free will]]) and  [[philosophy of mind]], though some [[evolutionary biologist]]s and [[theoretical physicist]]s have also made several allusions to the subject.&lt;ref name="Whitehouse"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Harvey Whitehouse |title=The Debated Mind: Evolutionary Psychology Versus Ethnography |publisher=Berg Publishers |date=2001 |isbn=978-1859734278}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gray"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Jeffrey Alan Gray |authorlink= Jeffrey Alan Gray |title=Consciousness: Creeping Up on the Hard Problem |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2004 |isbn=978-0198520900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hieronymus Bosch 013.jpg|thumb|[[Hieronymus Bosch]]'s ''[[Ascent of the Blessed]]'' depicts a tunnel of light and spiritual figures, often described in reports of [[near-death experience]]s.]]
[[Reductionistic]] and [[eliminative materialism|eliminative materialistic]] approaches, for example the [[Multiple Drafts Model]], hold that consciousness can be wholly explained by neuroscience through the workings of the [[Human brain|brain]] and its [[neuron]]s, thus adhering to [[biological naturalism]].&lt;ref name="Gray"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Churchland"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Paul M. Churchland |authorlink=Paul Churchland |title=A Neurocomputational Perspective: The Nature of Mind and the Structure of Science |publisher=MIT Press |date=1989 |isbn=978-0262531061}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dennett"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Daniel Clement Dennett |authorlink=Daniel Dennett |title=Consciousness Explained |publisher=Little, Brown and Co. |date=1991 |isbn=978-0316180665|title-link=Consciousness Explained }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, some scientists, like [[Andrei Linde]], have considered that [[consciousness]], like spacetime, might have its own intrinsic degrees of freedom, and that one's perceptions may be as real as (or even more real than) material objects.&lt;ref name="Barrow, Davies, Harper"&gt;{{Cite book |author1=John D. Barrow |authorlink1=John D. Barrow |author2=Paul C.W. Davies |authorlink2=Paul Davies |author3=Charles L.

Explaining the process of [[free will]] through [[quantum]] phenomena is a popular alternative to [[determinism]].

==== Parapsychology ====

Based on the premises of non-materialistic explanations of the mind, some have suggested the existence of a [[cosmic consciousness]], asserting that consciousness is actually the "ground of all being".&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bruce"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Alexandra Bruce |title=Beyond the Bleep: The Definitive Unauthorized Guide to What the Bleep Do We Know!? |publisher=The Disinformation Company |date=2005 |isbn=978-1932857221}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ho"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Mae-Wan Ho |authorlink=Mae-Wan Ho |title=The Rainbow and the Worm: The Physics of Organisms |publisher=World Scientific |date=1998 |pages= 218–231 |isbn=978-9810234270}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of this view cite accounts of [[paranormal]] phenomena, primarily [[extrasensory perception]]s and [[psychic]] powers, as evidence for an [[incorporeal]] [[higher consciousness]]. In hopes of proving the existence of these phenomena, [[parapsychologist]]s have orchestrated various experiments, but successful results might be due to poor experimental controls and might have alternative explanations.&lt;ref name="Akers"&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Akers, C. |title=Methodological Criticisms of Parapsychology, Advances in Parapsychological Research 4 |publisher=PesquisaPSI |date=1986 |url=http://www.pesquisapsi.com/books/advances4rape/7_Methodological_Criticisms.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130104093732/http://www.pesquisapsi.com/books/advances4rape/7_Methodological_Criticisms.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-04 |accessdate=2007-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Child, I.L. |title=Criticism in Experimental Parapsychology, Advances in Parapsychological Research 5 |publisher=PesquisaPSI |date=1987 |url=http://www.pesquisapsi.com/books/advances5/6_Criticism_in_Experimental.html |accessdate=2007-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927223410/http://www.pesquisapsi.com/books/advances5/6_Criticism_in_Experimental.html |archivedate=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wiseman |first=Richard |author2=Smith, Matthew |display-authors=etal |title=Exploring possible sender-to-experimenter acoustic leakage in the PRL autoganzfeld experiments – Psychophysical Research Laboratories |journal=The Journal of Parapsychology |date=1996 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2320/is_n2_v60/ai_18960809 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120709230555/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2320/is_n2_v60/ai_18960809 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-09 |accessdate=2007-07-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lobach |first=E. |author2=Bierman, D. |title=The Invisible Gaze: Three Attempts to Replicate Sheldrake's Staring Effects |work=Proceedings of the 47th PA Convention |url=http://www.parapsych.org/papers/07.pdf |date=2004 |pages=77–90 |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810173433/https://www.parapsych.org/papers/07.pdf |archivedate=10 August 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nature of meaning in life ===

The most common{{quantify|date=May 2018}} definitions of meaning in life involve three components.{{cn|date=May 2018}} First, Reker and [[Paul T. P. Wong|Wong]] define personal meaning as the "cognizance of order, coherence and purpose in one's existence, the pursuit and attainment of worthwhile goals, and an accompanying sense of fulfillment" (p.&amp;nbsp;221).&lt;ref&gt;Reker, G.T., &amp; Wong, P.T.P. (1988). Aging as an individual process: Towards a theory of personal meaning. In J.E. Birren, &amp; V.L. Bengston (Eds.), ''Emergent theories of aging'' (pp. 214-246). New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 Martela and Steger defined meaning as coherence, purpose, and significance.&lt;ref&gt;Martela, F., &amp; Steger, M.F. (2016). The three meanings of meaning in life: Distinguishing coherence, purpose, and significance. ''The Journal of Positive Psychology, 11''(5), 531-545.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[Paul T. P. Wong|Wong]] has proposed a four-component solution to the question of meaning in life,&lt;ref&gt;Wong, P.T.P. (2011). Positive psychology 2.0: Towards a balanced interactive model of the good life. ''Canadian Psychology, 52''(2), 69-81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Wong, P.T.P. (2012). From logotherapy to meaning-centered counseling and therapy. In P.T.P. Wong (Ed.), ''The human quest for meaning: Theories, research, and applications'' (2nd ed., pp. 619-647). New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; with the four components purpose, understanding, responsibility, and enjoyment (PURE):

# You need to choose a worthy ''purpose'' or a significant life goal.
# You need to have sufficient ''understanding'' of who you are, what life demands of you, and how you can play a significant role in life.
# You and you alone are ''responsible'' for deciding what kind of life you want to live, and what constitutes a significant and worthwhile life goal. 
# You will ''enjoy'' a deep sense of significance and satisfaction only when you have exercised your responsibility for self-determination and actively pursue a worthy life-goal.
Thus, a sense of significance permeates every dimension of meaning, rather than stands as a separate factor.

Although most psychology researchers consider meaning in life as a subjective feeling or judgment, most philosophers (e.g., Thaddeus Metz, Daniel Haybron) propose that there are also objective, concrete criteria for what constitutes meaning in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Meaning in life|last= Metz|first= Thaddeus|publisher= Oxford University Press|year= 2013|isbn= 978-0199599318|location= Oxford|pages= |via= }}

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Wong has proposed that whether life is meaningful depends not only on subjective feelings but, more importantly, on whether a person's goal-striving and life as a whole is meaningful according to some objective [[Normative ethics| normative standard]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Western philosophical perspectives==
The philosophical perspectives on the meaning of life are those ideologies which explain life in terms of ideals or abstractions defined by humans.

{{Main article|Platonism}}
[[Plato]], a pupil of [[Socrates]], was one of the earliest, most influential philosophers. His reputation comes from his [[philosophical idealism|idealism]] of believing in the existence of [[universals (metaphysics)|universals]]. His [[Theory of Forms]] proposes that universals do not physically exist, like objects, but as heavenly forms. In the [[dialogue]] of ''[[Plato's Republic|The Republic]]'', the character of [[Socrates]] describes the [[Form of the Good]]. His theory on justice in the soul relates to the idea of happiness relevant to the question of the meaning of life.

In Platonism, the meaning of life is in attaining the highest form of knowledge, which is the [[Platonic idealism|Idea]] ([[Platonic realism|Form]]) of the Good, from which all good and just things derive utility and value.

====Aristotelianism====
{{Main article|Aristotelian ethics}}
[[Aristotle]], an apprentice of [[Plato]], was another early and influential philosopher, who argued that ethical knowledge is not ''certain'' knowledge (such as [[metaphysics]] and [[epistemology]]), but is ''general'' knowledge. Because it is not a [[theoretical]] discipline, a person had to study and practice in order to become "good"; thus if the person were to become [[virtuous]], he could not simply study what virtue ''is'', he had to ''be'' virtuous, via virtuous activities. To do this, Aristotle established what is virtuous:
{{quote|Every skill and every inquiry, and similarly, every action and choice of action, is thought to have some good as its object. This is why the good has rightly been defined as the object of all endeavor [...]&lt;br&gt;Everything is done with a goal, and that goal is "good".|[[Nicomachean Ethics]] 1.1}}

Yet, if action A is done towards achieving goal B, then goal B also would have a goal, goal C, and goal C also would have a goal, and so would continue this pattern, until something stopped its [[infinite regression]]. Aristotle's solution is the ''[[Summum bonum|Highest Good]]'', which is desirable for its own sake. It is its own goal. The Highest Good is not desirable for the sake of achieving some other good, and all other "goods" desirable for its sake. This involves achieving ''[[eudaemonia]]'', usually translated as "happiness", "well-being", "flourishing", and "excellence".
{{quote|What is the highest good in all matters of action? To the name, there is almost complete agreement; for uneducated and educated alike call it happiness, and make happiness identical with the good life and successful living. They disagree, however, about the meaning of happiness.|[[Nicomachean Ethics]] 1.4}}

====Cynicism====
{{Main article|Cynicism (philosophy)}}
[[Antisthenes]], a pupil of [[Socrates]], first outlined the themes of Cynicism, stating that the purpose of life is living a life of [[Virtue]] which agrees with [[Nature]]. Happiness depends upon being self-sufficient and master of one's mental attitude; suffering is the consequence of false judgments of value, which cause negative [[emotions]] and a concomitant vicious character.

The Cynical life rejects conventional desires for [[wealth]], [[power (sociology)|power]], [[health]], and [[celebrity|fame]], by being free of the possessions acquired in pursuing the conventional.&lt;ref&gt;Kidd, I., "''Cynicism''," in ''The Concise Encyclopedia of Western Philosophy.'' (ed. [[J.O. Urmson]] and [[Jonathan Rée]]), Routledge. (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Long, A.A., "''The Socratic Tradition: Diogenes, Crates, and Hellenistic Ethics,''" in ''The Cynics: The Cynic Movement in Antiquity and Its Legacy.'' (ed. Branham and Goulet-Cazé), University of California Press, (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; As reasoning creatures, people could achieve happiness via rigorous training, by living in a way natural to [[human]] beings. The [[world]] equally belongs to everyone, so [[suffering]] is caused by false judgments of what is valuable and what is worthless per the [[tradition|customs]] and [[convention (norm)|conventions]] of [[society]].

====Cyrenaicism====
{{Main article|Cyrenaics}}
[[Aristippus of Cyrene]], a pupil of [[Socrates]], founded an early Socratic school that emphasized only one side of Socrates's teachings—that happiness is one of the ends of moral action and that pleasure is the supreme good; thus a [[hedonistic]] world view, wherein bodily gratification is more intense than mental pleasure. Cyrenaics prefer immediate gratification to the long-term gain of delayed gratification; denial is unpleasant unhappiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/|title=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|work=utm.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hedonism.org|title=The Future Of Hardcore Hedonism|work=hedonism.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Epicureanism====
{{Main article|Epicureanism}}

[[Epicurus]], a pupil of the Platonist Pamphilus of Samos, taught that the greatest good is in seeking modest pleasures, to attain tranquility and freedom from fear ([[ataraxia]]) via knowledge, friendship, and virtuous, temperate living; bodily pain ([[aponia]]) is absent through one's knowledge of the workings of the world and of the limits of one's desires. Combined, freedom from pain and freedom from fear are happiness in its highest form. Epicurus' lauded enjoyment of simple pleasures is quasi-ascetic "abstention" from sex and the appetites:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"When we say ... that pleasure is the end and aim, we do not mean the pleasures of the prodigal or the pleasures of sensuality, as we are understood to do, by some, through ignorance, prejudice or wilful misrepresentation. By pleasure we mean the absence of pain in the body and of trouble in the soul. It is not by an unbroken succession of drinking bouts and of revelry, not by sexual lust, nor the enjoyment of fish, and other delicacies of a luxurious table, which produce a pleasant life; it is sober reasoning, searching out the grounds of every choice and avoidance, and banishing those beliefs through which the greatest tumults take possession of the soul."&lt;ref&gt;[[Epicurus]], "Letter to Menoeceus", contained in Diogenes Laertius, ''Lives of Eminent Philosophers'', Book X&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Epicurean meaning of life rejects immortality and mysticism; there is a soul, but it is as mortal as the body. There is no [[afterlife]], yet, one need not fear death, because "Death is nothing to us; for that which is dissolved, is without sensation, and that which lacks sensation is nothing to us."&lt;ref name="Russel"&gt;[[Bertrand Russell]] (1946). ''[[History of Western Philosophy (Russell)|A History of Western Philosophy]]'', New York: Simon and Schuster; London: George Allen and Unwin&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stoicism====
{{Main page|Stoicism}}
[[Zeno of Citium]], a pupil of [[Crates of Thebes]], established the school which teaches that living according to reason and virtue is to be in harmony with the universe's divine order, entailed by one's recognition of the universal ''[[logos]]'', or reason, an essential value of all people. The meaning of life is "freedom from [[suffering]]" through ''[[apatheia]]'' (Gr: απαθεια), that is, being [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] and having "clear judgement", ''not'' indifference.

Stoicism's prime directives are [[virtue]], [[reason]], and [[natural law]], abided to develop personal self-control and mental fortitude as means of overcoming destructive [[emotion]]s. The Stoic does not seek to extinguish emotions, only to avoid emotional troubles, by developing clear judgement and inner calm through diligently practiced logic, reflection, and concentration.

The Stoic ethical foundation is that "good lies in the state of the soul", itself, exemplified in [[wisdom]] and self-control, thus improving one's spiritual well-being: "''Virtue'' consists in a ''will'' which is in agreement with Nature."&lt;ref name="Russel"/&gt; The principle applies to one's personal relations thus: "to be free from anger, envy, and jealousy".&lt;ref name="Russel"/&gt;

===Enlightenment philosophy===
{{Further information|Enlightenment philosophy}}
The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and the [[colonialism|colonial era]] both changed the nature of European philosophy and exported it worldwide. Devotion and subservience to God were largely replaced by notions of inalienable natural rights and the potentialities of reason, and universal ideals of love and compassion gave way to civic notions of freedom, equality, and citizenship. The meaning of life changed as well, focusing less on humankind's relationship to God and more on the relationship between individuals and their society. This era is filled with theories that equate meaningful existence with the social order.

====Classical liberalism====
[[Classical liberalism]] is a set of ideas that arose in the 17th and 18th centuries, out of conflicts between a growing, wealthy, propertied class and the established aristocratic and religious orders that dominated Europe. Liberalism cast humans as beings with inalienable natural [[individual rights|rights]] (including the right to retain the wealth generated by one's own work), and sought out means to balance rights across society. Broadly speaking, it considers [[individualism|individual]] [[liberty]] to be the most important goal,&lt;ref&gt;A: "'Liberalism' is defined as a social ethic that advocates liberty, and equality in general." —[[C.A.J. (Tony) Coady]] ''Distributive Justice'', A Companion to Contemporary Political Philosophy, editors Goodin, Robert E. and Pettit, Philip. Blackwell Publishing, 1995, p.440. B: "Liberty is not a means to a higher political end. It is itself the highest political end."  —[[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|Lord Acton]]&lt;/ref&gt; because only through ensured liberty are the other inherent rights protected.

There are many forms and derivations of liberalism, but their central conceptions of the meaning of life trace back to three main ideas. Early thinkers such as [[John Locke]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and [[Adam Smith]] saw humankind beginning in the [[state of nature]], then finding meaning for existence through labor and property, and using [[social contracts]] to create an environment that supports those efforts.

====Kantianism====
[[File:Immanuel Kant (portrait).jpg|thumb|[[Immanuel Kant]] is regarded as one of the most influential thinkers of the late [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].]]

[[Kantianism]] is a philosophy based on the [[ethical]], [[epistemological]], and [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] works of [[Immanuel Kant]]. Kant is known for his [[Deontology|deontological]] theory where there is a single moral obligation, the "[[Categorical Imperative]]", derived from the concept of [[duty]]. Kantians believe all actions are performed in accordance with some underlying [[maxim (philosophy)|maxim]] or principle, and for actions to be ethical, they must adhere to the categorical imperative.

Simply put, the test is that one must universalize the maxim (imagine that all people acted in this way) and then see if it would still be possible to perform the maxim in the world without contradiction. In ''Groundwork'', Kant gives the example of a person who seeks to borrow money without intending to pay it back. This is a contradiction because if it were a [[moral universalism|universal action]], no person would lend money anymore as he knows that he will never be paid back. The maxim of this action, says Kant, results in a contradiction in conceivability (and thus contradicts perfect duty).

Kant also denied that the consequences of an act in any way contribute to the moral worth of that act, his reasoning being that the physical world is outside one's full control and thus one cannot be held accountable for the events that occur in it.

===19th-century philosophy===
{{Further information|19th-century philosophy}}

====Utilitarianism====
[[File:Jeremy Bentham by Henry William Pickersgill detail.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jeremy Bentham]]]]

The origins of [[utilitarianism]] can be traced back as far as [[Epicurus]], but, as a school of thought, it is credited to [[Jeremy Bentham]],&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, Frederick (2003). ''Classical Utilitarianism from Hume to Mill''. Routledge, p. 28. {{ISBN|0415220947}} "It was Hume and Bentham who then reasserted most strongly the Epicurean doctrine concerning utility as the basis of justice."&lt;/ref&gt; who found that "nature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters, pain and pleasure", then, from that moral insight, deriving the ''Rule of Utility'': "that the good is whatever brings the greatest happiness to the greatest number of people". He defined the meaning of life as the "[[greatest happiness principle]]".

[[Jeremy Bentham]]'s foremost proponent was [[James Mill]], a significant philosopher in his day, and father of [[John Stuart Mill]]. The younger Mill was educated per Bentham's principles, including transcribing and summarizing much of his father's work.&lt;ref name="Mill"&gt;Mill, John Stuart. ''On Liberty'', ed. Himmelfarb. Penguin Classics, 1974, Ed.'s introduction, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nihilism====
[[Nihilism]] suggests that life is without objective meaning.

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] characterized nihilism as emptying the world, and especially human existence, of meaning, purpose, comprehensible truth, and essential value; succinctly, nihilism is the process of "the devaluing of the highest values".&lt;ref name="Bindé"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Jérôme Bindé |title=The Future Of Values: 21st-Century Talks |publisher=Berghahn Books |date=2004 |isbn=978-1571814425}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing the nihilist as a natural result of the idea that [[God is dead]], and insisting it was something to overcome, his questioning of the nihilist's life-negating values returned meaning to the Earth.&lt;ref name="Reginster"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Bernard Reginster |title=The Affirmation of Life: Nietzsche on Overcoming Nihilism |publisher=Harvard University Press |date=2006 |isbn=978-0674021990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John Martin - The Great Day of His Wrath - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[The End of the World (painting)|The End of the World]]'', by John Martin.]]
To [[Martin Heidegger]], nihilism is the movement whereby "[[being]]" is forgotten, and is transformed into value, in other words, the reduction of being to exchange value.&lt;ref name="Bindé"/&gt; Heidegger, in accordance with Nietzsche, saw in the so-called "[[God is dead|death of God]]" a potential source for nihilism:
''&lt;blockquote&gt;If God, as the supra-sensory ground and goal, of all reality, is dead; if the supra-sensory world of the Ideas has suffered the loss of its obligatory, and above it, its vitalizing and up-building power, then nothing more remains to which Man can cling, and by which he can orient himself.&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger, "The Word of Nietzsche," 61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;''

The French philosopher [[Albert Camus]] asserts that the [[absurdity]] of the [[human condition]] is that people search for external values and meaning in a world which has none, and is indifferent to them. Camus writes of value-nihilists such as [[The Stranger (Camus novel)|Meursault]],&lt;ref&gt;Camus (1946) ''L'Etranger''&lt;/ref&gt; but also of values in a nihilistic world, that people can instead strive to be "heroic nihilists", living with dignity in the face of absurdity, living with "secular saintliness", fraternal solidarity, and rebelling against and transcending the world's indifference.&lt;ref&gt;Camus (1955) ''The Myth of Sisyphus''&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th-century philosophy===
{{Further information|20th-century philosophy}}
The current era has seen radical changes in both formal and popular conceptions of human nature. The knowledge disclosed by modern science has effectively rewritten the relationship of humankind to the natural world. Advances in medicine and technology have freed humans from significant limitations and ailments of previous eras;&lt;ref&gt;For example, see [[hygiene]], [[antibiotic]] and [[vaccination]].&lt;/ref&gt; and philosophy—particularly following the [[linguistic turn]]—has altered how the relationships people have with themselves and each other are conceived.  Questions about the meaning of life have also seen radical changes, from attempts to reevaluate human existence in biological and scientific terms (as in [[#Pragmatism|pragmatism]] and [[#Logical positivism|logical positivism]]) to efforts to meta-theorize about [[meaning-making]] as a personal, individual-driven activity ([[#Existentialism|existentialism]], [[#Secular humanism|secular humanism]]).

====Pragmatism====
[[Pragmatism]] originated in the late-19th-century US, concerning itself (mostly) with [[truth]], and positing that "only in struggling with the environment" do data, and derived theories, have meaning, and that ''consequences'', like utility and practicality, are also components of truth. Moreover, pragmatism posits that ''anything'' useful and practical is not always true, arguing that what most contributes to the most human good in the long course is true. In practice, theoretical claims must be ''practically verifiable'', i.e. one should be able to predict and test claims, and, that, ultimately, the needs of humankind should guide human intellectual inquiry.

Pragmatic philosophers suggest that the practical, useful understanding of life is more important than searching for an impractical abstract truth about life. [[William James]] argued that truth could be made, but not sought.&lt;ref name="James"&gt;{{Cite book |author=William James |authorlink=William James |title=The Meaning of Truth |publisher=Prometheus Books |date=1909 |isbn=978-1573921381}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Corti"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Walter Robert Corti |title=The Philosophy of William James |publisher=Meiner Verlag |date=1976 |isbn=978-3787303526}}&lt;/ref&gt; To a pragmatist, the meaning of life is discoverable only via experience.

====Theism====
{{Main article|Philosophical theism}}
Theists believe God created the universe and that God had a purpose in doing so. Theists also hold the view that humans find their meaning and purpose for life in God's purpose in creating.  Theists further hold that if there were no God to give life ultimate meaning, value and purpose, then life would be absurd.&lt;ref name = "Theistic Perspectives on the Meaning of Life"&gt;[http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/~morourke/446-phil/05%20Spring/Handouts/Philosophical/Theistic%20Perspectives-MOL.htm Philosophy 446: Theistic Perspectives on the Meaning of Life]. Webpages.uidaho.edu. Retrieved on 2013-10-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Existentialism====
{{Main article|Meaning (existential)}}
[[File:The Scream.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Edvard Munch]]'s ''[[The Scream]]'', a representation of [[existential angst]].]]
According to existentialism, each man and each woman creates the essence (meaning) of their life; life is not determined by a supernatural god or an earthly authority, one is free. As such, one's ethical prime directives are ''action'', ''freedom'', and ''decision'', thus, existentialism opposes [[rationalism]] and [[positivism (philosophy)|positivism]]. In seeking meaning to life, the existentialist looks to where people find meaning in life, in course of which using only reason as a source of meaning is insufficient; this gives rise to the emotions of [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]] and [[angst|dread]], felt in considering one's [[free will]], and the concomitant awareness of death. According to [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[existence precedes essence]]; the ([[essence]]) of one's life arises ''only'' after one comes to [[existence]].

[[Søren Kierkegaard]] spoke about a "[[q:Søren Kierkegaard#Misattributed|leap]]", arguing that [[absurdism|life is full of absurdity]], and one must make his and her own values in an indifferent world. One can live meaningfully (free of despair and anxiety) in an unconditional commitment to something finite, and devotes that meaningful life to the commitment, despite the vulnerability inherent to doing so.&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Amy Laura Hall |title=Kierkegaard and the Treachery of Love |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2002 |isbn=978-0521893114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] answered: "What is the meaning of life?" by stating that one's life reflects one's will, and that the will (life) is an aimless, irrational, and painful drive. Salvation, deliverance, and escape from suffering are in aesthetic contemplation, sympathy for others, and [[asceticism]].&lt;ref name="Jacquette"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Dale Jacquette |title=Schopenhauer, Philosophy, and the Arts |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=1996 |isbn=978-0521473880}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Murray"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Durno Murray |title=Nietzsche's Affirmative Morality |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |date=1999 |isbn=978-3110166019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], life is worth living only if there are goals inspiring one to live. Accordingly, he saw nihilism ("all that happens is meaningless") as without goals. He stated that asceticism denies one's living in the world; stated that values are not objective facts, that are rationally necessary, universally binding commitments: our evaluations are interpretations, and not reflections of the world, as it is, in itself, and, therefore, [[perspectivism|all ideations take place from a particular perspective]].&lt;ref name="Reginster"/&gt;

====Absurdism====
{{Main article|Absurdism}}
{{Quote box |quote="''... in spite of or in defiance of the whole of existence he wills to be himself with it, to take it along, almost defying his torment. For to hope in the possibility of help, not to speak of help by virtue of the absurd, that for God all things are possible—no, that he will not do. And as for seeking help from any other—no, that he will not do for all the world; rather than seek help he would prefer to be himself—with all the tortures of hell, if so it must be.''" |source=[[Søren Kierkegaard]], ''[[The Sickness Unto Death]]''&lt;ref name="KierkegaardSuD"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kierkegaard|first=Søren|authorlink=Søren Kierkegaard|title=The Sickness Unto Death|publisher=Princeton University Press|date=1941|isbn=978-1448675029}}&lt;/ref&gt; |width=30% |align=right}}
In absurdist philosophy, the Absurd arises out of the fundamental disharmony between the individual's search for meaning and the apparent meaninglessness of the universe. As beings looking for meaning in a meaningless world, humans have three ways of resolving the dilemma. Kierkegaard and Camus describe the solutions in their works, ''[[The Sickness Unto Death]]'' (1849) and ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]'' (1942):
* [[Suicide]] (or, "escaping existence"): a solution in which a person simply ends one's own life. Both Kierkegaard and Camus dismiss the viability of this option.
* [[Religious]] belief in a [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] realm or being: a solution in which one believes in the existence of a reality that is beyond the Absurd, and, as such, has meaning. Kierkegaard stated that a belief in anything beyond the Absurd requires a non-rational but perhaps necessary religious acceptance in such an intangible and empirically unprovable thing (now commonly referred to as a "[[leap of faith]]"). However, Camus regarded this solution as "philosophical suicide".
* Acceptance of the Absurd: a solution in which one accepts and even embraces the Absurd and continues to live in spite of it. Camus endorsed this solution (notably in his 1947 allegorical novel ''The Plague'' or ''La Peste''), while Kierkegaard regarded this solution as "demoniac madness": "''He rages most of all at the thought that eternity might get it into its head to take his misery from him!''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kierkegaard |first=Søren |authorlink=Søren Kierkegaard |title=The Sickness Unto Death |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=1941 |isbn=978-1448675029}}, Part I, Ch. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Secular humanism====

[[File:HumanismSymbol.PNG|left|thumb|The "[[Happy Human]]" symbol representing [[Secular Humanism]].]]

Per [[secular humanism]], the [[Human|human species]] came to be by reproducing successive generations in a progression of [[Evolution|unguided evolution]] as an integral expression of [[nature]], which is self-existing.&lt;ref name="humanifesto1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Humanist Manifesto I |url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/about/manifesto1.html |work=American Humanist Association |date=1933 |accessdate=2007-07-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070730070437/http://www.americanhumanist.org/about/manifesto1.html |archivedate=30 July 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="humanifesto2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Humanist Manifesto II |work=American Humanist Association |date=1973 |url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/about/manifesto2.html |accessdate=2007-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809102124/http://www.americanhumanist.org/about/manifesto2.html |archivedate=9 August 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Human knowledge comes from human observation, experimentation, and rational analysis (the [[scientific method]]), and not from supernatural sources; the nature of the [[universe]] is what people discern it to be.&lt;ref name=humanifesto1/&gt; Likewise, "[[intrinsic value (ethics)|values]] and realities" are determined "by means of intelligent inquiry"&lt;ref name=humanifesto1/&gt; and "are derived from human need and interest as tested by experience", that is, by [[critical thinking|critical intelligence]].&lt;ref name="humanifesto3"&gt;{{cite web|title=Humanist Manifesto III |work=American Humanist Association |date=2003 |url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/3/HumandItsAspirations.php |accessdate=2007-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809103515/http://www.americanhumanist.org/3/HumandItsAspirations.php |archivedate=9 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CDSH"&gt;{{cite web |title=A Secular Humanist Declaration |work=Council for Democratic and Secular Humanism (now the Council for Secular Humanism) |date=1980 |url=http://www.secularhumanism.org/index.php?section=main&amp;page=declaration |accessdate=2007-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; "As far as we know, the total personality is [a function] of the biological organism transacting in a social and cultural context."&lt;ref name=humanifesto2/&gt;

People determine human purpose without supernatural influence; it is the human personality (general sense) that is the purpose of a human being's life. [[Secular humanism|Humanism]] seeks to develop and fulfill:&lt;ref name= humanifesto1/&gt; "Humanism affirms our ability and responsibility to lead ethical lives of personal fulfillment that aspire to the greater good of humanity".&lt;ref name=humanifesto3/&gt; Humanism aims to promote [[enlightened self-interest]] and the [[common good]] for all people. It is based on the premises that the [[happiness]] of the individual person is inextricably linked to the well-being of all humanity, in part because humans are social animals who find meaning in [[interpersonal relationship|personal relations]] and because cultural progress benefits everybody living in the [[culture]].&lt;ref name= humanifesto2/&gt;&lt;ref name=humanifesto3/&gt;

The philosophical subgenres [[posthumanism]] and [[transhumanism]] (sometimes used synonymously) are extensions of humanistic values. One should seek the advancement of [[human race|humanity]] and of [[biocentrism (ethics)|all life]] to the greatest degree feasible and seek to reconcile [[Renaissance humanism]] with the 21st century's [[technoscientific]] culture. In this light, every living creature has the right to determine its personal and social "meaning of life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Nick Bostrom |title=Transhumanist Values |work=[[Oxford University]] |date=2005 |url=http://www.nickbostrom.com/ethics/values.html |accessdate=2007-07-28 |authorlink=Nick Bostrom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From a [[Secular humanism|humanism]]-psychotherapeutic point of view, the question of the meaning of life could be reinterpreted as "What is the meaning of ''my'' life?"&lt;ref&gt;Irvin Yalom, ''Existential Psychotherapy'', 1980&lt;/ref&gt; This approach emphasizes that the question is personal—and avoids focusing on cosmic or religious questions about overarching purpose. There are many therapeutic responses to this question.  For example, [[Viktor Frankl]] argues for "Dereflection", which translates largely as: cease endlessly reflecting on the self; instead, engage in life. On the whole, the therapeutic response is that the question itself—what is the meaning of life?—evaporates when one is fully engaged in life. (The question then morphs into more specific worries such as "What delusions am I under?"; "What is blocking my ability to enjoy things?"; "Why do I neglect loved-ones?".) ''See also: [[Existential Therapy]] and [[Irvin Yalom]]''

====Logical positivism====
[[Logical positivists]] ask: "What is the meaning of life?", "What is the meaning in asking?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Richard Taylor |authorlink=Richard Taylor (philosopher) |title=Good and Evil |chapter= Chapter 5: The Meaning of Life |publisher=Macmillan Publishing Company |year=1970 |isbn=978-0026166904}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wohlgennant, Rudolph. (1981). "Has the Question about the Meaning of Life any Meaning?" (Chapter 4). In E. Morscher, ed., ''Philosophie als Wissenschaft''.&lt;/ref&gt; and "If there are no objective values, then, is life meaningless?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=McNaughton |first=David |date=August 1988 |title=Moral Vision: An Introduction to Ethics |chapter=Section 1.5: Moral Freedom and the Meaning of Life |publisher=Oxford: Blackwell Publishing |isbn=978-0631159452}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and the [[logical positivists]] said:{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} "Expressed in language, the question is meaningless"; because, ''in'' life the statement the "meaning of x", usually denotes the ''consequences'' of x, or the ''significance'' of x, or ''what is notable'' about x, etc., thus, when the meaning of life concept equals "x", in the statement the "meaning of x", the statement becomes [[recursion|recursive]], and, therefore, nonsensical, or it might refer to the fact that biological life is essential to having a meaning in life.

The things (people, events) in the life of a person can have meaning (importance) as parts of a whole, but a discrete meaning of (the) life, itself, aside from those things, cannot be discerned. A person's life has meaning (for themselves, others) as the life events resulting from their achievements, legacy, family, etc., but, to say that life, itself, has meaning, is a misuse of language, since any note of significance, or of consequence, is relevant only ''in'' life (to the living), so rendering the statement erroneous. [[Bertrand Russell]] wrote that although he found that his distaste for torture was not like his distaste for broccoli, he found no satisfactory, empirical method of proving this:&lt;ref name="Russel"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;When we try to be definite, as to what we mean when we say that this or that is "the Good," we find ourselves involved in very great difficulties. Bentham's creed, that pleasure is the Good, roused furious opposition, and was said to be a pig's philosophy. Neither he nor his opponents could advance any argument. In a scientific question, evidence can be adduced on both sides, and, in the end, one side is seen to have the better case—or, if this does not happen, the question is left undecided. But in a question, as to whether this, or that, is the ultimate Good, there is no evidence, either way; each disputant can only appeal to his own emotions, and employ such rhetorical devices as shall rouse similar emotions in others ... Questions as to "values"—that is to say, as to what is good or bad on its own account, independently of its effects—lie outside the domain of science, as the defenders of religion emphatically assert. I think that, in this, they are right, but, I draw the further conclusion, which they do not draw, that questions as to "values" lie wholly outside the domain of knowledge. That is to say, when we assert that this, or that, has "value", we are giving expression to our own emotions, not to a fact, which would still be true if our personal feelings were different.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertrand Russell]] (1961). [http://www.solstice.us/russell/science-ethics.html ''Science and Ethics''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114144956/http://www.solstice.us/russell/science-ethics.html |date=14 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Postmodernism====
{{Further information|Postmodernism}}
Postmodernist thought—broadly speaking—sees human nature as constructed by language, or by structures and institutions of human society. Unlike other forms of philosophy, postmodernism rarely seeks out ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' or innate meanings in human existence, but instead focuses on analyzing or critiquing ''given'' meanings in order to rationalize or reconstruct them. Anything resembling a "meaning of life", in postmodernist terms, can only be understood within a social and linguistic framework, and must be pursued as an escape from the power structures that are already embedded in all forms of speech and interaction. As a rule, postmodernists see [[awareness]] of the constraints of language as necessary to escaping those constraints, but different theorists take different views on the nature of this process: from radical reconstruction of meaning by individuals (as in [[deconstructionism]]) to theories in which individuals are primarily extensions of language and society, without real autonomy (as in [[poststructuralism]]).

====Naturalistic pantheism====
According to [[naturalistic pantheism]], the meaning of life is to care for and look after nature and the environment.

====Embodied cognition====
[[Embodied cognition]] uses the neurological basis of emotion, speech, and cognition to understand the nature of thought. [[Cognitive neuropsychology]] has identified brain areas necessary for these abilities, and genetic studies show that the gene [[FOXP2]] affects neuroplasticity which underlies language fluency. 
[[George Lakoff]], a professor of cognitive linguistics and philosophy, advances the view that metaphors are the usual basis of meaning, not the logic of verbal symbol manipulation. Computers use [[logic programming]] to effectively query databases but humans rely on a trained [[biological neural network]]. Post modern philosophies that use the indeterminacy of symbolic language to deny definite meaning ignore those who feel they know what they mean and feel that their interlocutors know what they mean. Choosing the correct metaphor results in enough common understanding to pursue questions such as the meaning of life. Improved knowledge of brain function should result in better treatments producing healthier brains. When combined with more effective training, a sound personal assessment as to the meaning of one’s life should be straightforward.

===Mohism===
{{further information|Mohism}}
The Mohist philosophers believed that the purpose of life was universal, impartial [[love]]. Mohism promoted a philosophy of impartial caring—a person should care equally for all other individuals, regardless of their actual relationship to him or her.&lt;ref name="philosophers"&gt;''One hundred Philosophers. A guide to the world's greatest thinkers'' Peter J. King, Polish edition: Elipsa 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The expression of this indiscriminate caring is what makes man a righteous being in Mohist thought. This advocacy of impartiality was a target of attack by the other Chinese philosophical schools, most notably the [[Confucian]]s who believed that while love should be unconditional, it should not be indiscriminate. For example, children should hold a greater love for their parents than for random strangers.

===Confucianism===
{{further information|Confucianism}}
[[Confucianism]] recognizes human nature in accordance with the need for discipline and education. Because humankind is driven by both positive and negative influences, Confucianists see a goal in achieving virtue through strong relationships and reasoning as well as minimizing the negative. This emphasis on normal living is seen in the Confucianist scholar [[Tu Wei-Ming]]'s quote, "we can realize the ultimate meaning of life in ordinary human existence."&lt;ref&gt;Tu, Wei-Ming. ''Confucian Thought: Selfhood as Creative Transformation.'' Albany: State University of New York Press, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legalism===
{{further information|Legalism (Chinese philosophy)}}
The Legalists believed that finding the purpose of life was a meaningless effort. To the Legalists, only practical knowledge was valuable, especially as it related to the function and performance of the state.

==Religious perspectives==
The religious perspectives on the meaning of life are those ideologies which explain life in terms of an implicit purpose not defined by humans. According to the [[Charter for Compassion]] signed by many of the world's leading religious and secular organizations, the core of religion is the [[golden rule]] of `treat others as you would have them treat you'.  The Charter's founder, [[Karen Armstrong]], quotes the ancient Rabbi [[Hillel the Elder|Hillel]] who suggested that `the rest is commentary'.   This is not to reduce the commentary's importance, and Armstrong considers that its study, interpretation and ritual are the means by which religious people [[Internalisation (sociology)|internalize]] and  live the golden rule.
&lt;!--Note: the following two commented sections were commented out when I re-classified the sections. It is preserved here in case someone can make use of it later--&gt;
&lt;!--The rise of [[universal religion]]s marks a shift from concerns about personal potential and relationships to the natural world, to a focus on more profound forms of devotion and all-inclusive salvation.  In the Christian, Muslim, and Sikh faiths, this manifested as subjection to God: salvation was not a personal achievement, but rather a token of God's grace to be earned by the devout. Eastern traditions like Buddhism and Hinduism, likewise, moved from their primary focus on individual liberation to more abstract ideals of liberation for all. In all, this era magnified and generalized ideals of love, compassion, and relief of human suffering that had little or no place in earlier philosophy.--&gt;
&lt;!--Prior to the expansion of the major [[universal religion]]s—from the 1st or 2nd centuries BCE to the 6th century CE, depending on the faith—the meaning of life was investigated in terms of human potential and the relationship of individuals to the natural world. Devotion to a god or gods was an important aspect of some traditions, but was generally viewed in terms of personal development (as in the [[#Hindu views|Hindu]] relationship between ''atman'' and ''brahman'', or as a social relationship, as in the [[#jewish view|Jewish covenant]]). Other traditions relied heavily on reason, discipline, or the development of other human faculties, either as meaningful in their own right, or as tools to reach other decisions.--&gt;

====Zoroastrianism====
[[Zoroastrianism]] is the religion and philosophy named after its prophet [[Zoroaster]], which is believed to have influenced the beliefs of Judaism and its descendant religions. Zoroastrians believe in a universe created by a transcendental God, [[Ahura Mazda]], to whom all worship is ultimately directed. Ahura Mazda's creation is ''[[asha]]'', truth and order, and it is in conflict with its [[antithesis]], ''druj'', falsehood and disorder. (See also [[Zoroastrian eschatology]]).

Since humanity possesses [[free will]], people must be responsible for their moral choices. By using free will, people must take an active role in the universal conflict, with good thoughts, good words and good deeds to ensure happiness and to keep chaos at bay.

====Islam====
In [[Islam]], humanity's ultimate purpose is to discover their creator [[Allah]] ({{lang-en|God}}) through His signs, and be grateful to Him through sincere love and devotion. This is practically shown by following the Divine guidelines revealed in the [[Qur'an]] and the Tradition of the [[Muhammad|Prophet]]. Earthly life is a test, determining one's position of closeness to [[Allah]] in the hereafter. A person will either be close to Him and His Love in ''[[Jannah]]'' (Paradise) or far away in ''[[Jahannam]]'' (Hell).

For Allah's satisfaction, via the Qur'an, all Muslims must believe in God, his revelations, his [[Angels in Islam|angels]], his [[Prophets in Islam|messengers]], and in the "[[Qiyamah|Day of Judgment]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|2|4|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|2|285|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|4|136|style=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Qur'an describes the purpose of creation as follows: "Blessed be he in whose hand is the kingdom, he is powerful over all things, who created death and life that he might examine which of you is best in deeds, and he is the almighty, the forgiving" (Qur'an 67:1–2) and "And I (Allâh) created not the jinn and mankind except that they should be obedient (to Allah)." (Qur'an 51:56). Obedience testifies to the [[Tawhid|oneness of God]] in his lordship, his names, and his attributes. Terrenal life is a test; how one ''acts'' (behaves) determines whether one's soul goes to Jannat (Heaven) or to Jahannam (Hell).&lt;ref&gt;In most English translations of Qur'an 51:56  translates the last word to "worship", but any Arabic (and Urdu) speaking person can confirm that "ABADON" means to follow the Will of Allah (NOT worship). This is relevant because the Will of Allah is not just to worship HIM; to be just and good with humanity is equally important.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} However, on the day of Judgement the final decision is of Allah alone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iqra.net/Hadith/judgement.php The Day of Judgement].

The [[Five Pillars of Islam]] are duties incumbent to every Muslim; they are: [[Shahadah]] (profession of faith); [[salat]] (ritual prayer); [[Zakah]] (charity); [[Sawm]] (fasting during [[Ramadan]]), and [[Hajj]] (pilgrimage to [[Mecca]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Pillars of Islam |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/295625/Pillars-of-Islam |accessdate=2007-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; They derive from the [[Hadith]] works, notably of [[Sahih Al-Bukhari]] and [[Sahih Muslim]]. The five pillars are not mentioned directly in the Quran.

Beliefs differ among the [[Kalam]]. The [[Sunni]] and the [[Ahmadiyya]] concept of pre-destination is [[Qadr (doctrine)|divine decree]];&lt;ref&gt;{{hadith-usc|usc=yes|Muslim|1|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; likewise, the [[Shi'a]] concept of pre-destination is [[Adalah|divine justice]]; in the [[esoteric]] view of the [[Sufi]]s, the universe exists only for God's pleasure; Creation is a grand game, wherein Allah is the greatest prize.

The Sufi view of the meaning of life stems from the [[hadith qudsi]] that states "I (God) was [[a Hidden Treasure]] and loved to be known. Therefore I created the Creation that I might be known."  One possible interpretation of this view is that the meaning of life for an individual is to know the nature of God, and the purpose of all of creation is to reveal that nature, and to prove its value as the ultimate treasure, that is God. However, this hadith is stated in various forms and interpreted in various ways by people, such, as [['Abdu'l-Bahá]] of the [[Bahá'í Faith]],&lt;ref name='Commentary on the Islamic Tradition "I Was a Hidden Treasure ..."'&gt;{{cite web|last=Bahá|first=Abdu'l|title=Commentary on the Islamic Tradition "I Was a Hidden Treasure ..."|url=http://bahai-library.com/abdulbaha_kuntu_kanzan_makhfiyyan|work=Bahá'í Studies Bulletin|accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Ibn Arabi|Ibn'Arabī]]'s Fuṣūṣ al-Ḥikam.&lt;ref name="SUMMARY OF THE FUSÛS"&gt;{{cite web|last=Chittick|first=William C.|title=The Imprint of the Bezels of the Wisdom|url=http://www.ibnarabisociety.org/articlespdf/naqshalfusus.pdf|work=Ibn 'Arabi's Own Summary of the Fusûs|accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bahá'í Faith====

The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |volume=Fourth Edition |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/bahaism}}&lt;/ref&gt; To Bahá'ís, the purpose of life is focused on spiritual growth and service to humanity. Human beings are viewed as intrinsically spiritual beings. People's lives in this material world provide extended opportunities to grow, to develop divine qualities and virtues, and the [[Manifestation of God|prophets]] were sent by God to facilitate this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Smith |first=P. |date=1999 |title=A Concise Encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location=Oxford |pages=325–328 |isbn=978-1851681846}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a more detailed Bahá'í perspective, see {{cite web |title={{-'}}The Purpose of Life' Bahá'í Topics An Information Resource of the Bahá'í International Community |url=http://info.bahai.org/article-1-4-0-6.html |access-date=13 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090829233333/http://info.bahai.org/article-1-4-0-6.html |archive-date=29 August 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Judaism====
In the [[Judaism|Judaic]] world view, the meaning of life is to elevate the physical world ('Olam HaZeh') and prepare it for the world to come ('[[Jewish eschatology|Olam HaBa]]'), the [[Jewish messianism|messianic era]]. This is called [[Tikkun Olam]] ("Fixing the World"). Olam HaBa can also mean the spiritual afterlife, and there is debate concerning the eschatological order. However, Judaism is not focused on personal salvation, but on communal (between man and man) and individual (between man and God) spiritualised actions in this world.

Judaism's most important feature is the worship of a single, incomprehensible, [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]], one, indivisible, [[God in Judaism|absolute Being]], who created and governs the universe. Closeness with the God of Israel is through study of His [[Torah]], and adherence to its [[mitzvot]] (divine laws). In traditional Judaism, God established a special [[Covenant (Israel)|covenant]] with a people, the people of Israel, at [[Mount Sinai]], giving the [[613 mitzvot|Jewish commandments]]. Torah comprises the written [[Pentateuch]] and the transcribed [[Oral Torah|oral tradition]], further developed through the generations. The Jewish people are intended as "a kingdom of priests and a holy nation"&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 19:6&lt;/ref&gt; and a "[[Light Unto the Nations|light to the Nations]]", influencing the other peoples to keep their own religio-ethical [[Seven Laws of Noah]]. The messianic era is seen as the perfection of this dual path to God.

Jewish observances involve ethical and ritual, affirmative and prohibitive injunctions. Modern [[Jewish denominations]] differ over the nature, relevance and emphases of mitzvot. [[Jewish philosophy]] emphasises that God is not affected or benefited, but the individual and society benefit by drawing close to God. The rationalist [[Maimonides]] sees the ethical and ritual divine commandments as a necessary, but insufficient preparation for philosophical understanding of God, with its love and awe.&lt;ref&gt;''Maimonides' Confrontation with Mysticism'', Menachem Kellner, Littman Library; particularly the parable of the King's Palace in divine worship, in the [[Guide for the Perplexed]]&lt;/ref&gt; Among fundamental [[Jewish ethics|values]] in the Torah are pursuit of justice, compassion, peace, kindness, hard work, prosperity, humility, and education.&lt;ref name="Cohn-Sherbok"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Dan Cohn-Sherbok |title=Judaism: History, Belief, and Practice |publisher=Routledge |date=2003 |isbn=978-0415236614}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heschel"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Abraham Joshua Heschel |title=Heavenly Torah: As Refracted Through the Generations |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |date=2005 |isbn=978-0826408020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The world to come,&lt;ref name="Shuchat"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Wilfred Shuchat |title=The Garden of Eden &amp; the Struggle to Be Human: According to the Midrash Rabbah |publisher=Devora Publishing |date=2006 |isbn=978-1932687316}}&lt;/ref&gt; prepared in the present, elevates man to an everlasting connection with God.&lt;ref name="Braham"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Randolph L. Braham |title=Contemporary Views on the Holocaust |publisher=Springer |date=1983 |isbn=978-0898381412}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Simeon the Just|Simeon the Righteous]] says, "the world stands on three things: on Torah, on worship, and on acts of loving kindness." The [[Siddur|prayer book]] relates, "blessed is our God who created us for his honor...and planted within us everlasting life." Of this context, the [[Talmud]] states, "everything that God does is for the good," including suffering.

The Jewish mystical [[Kabbalah]] gives complimentary esoteric meanings of life. As well as Judaism providing an [[Divine immanence|immanent]] relationship with God (personal [[theism]]), in Kabbalah the spiritual and physical creation is a paradoxical manifestation of the immanent aspects of God's Being ([[panentheism]]), related to the [[Shekhinah]] (Divine feminine). Jewish observance unites the [[sephirot]] (Divine attributes) on high, restoring harmony to creation. In [[Lurianic Kabbalah]], the meaning of life is the messianic rectification of the shattered sparks of God's persona, exiled in physical existence (the [[Kelipot]] shells), through the actions of Jewish observance.&lt;ref&gt;''Kabbalah: A Very Short Introduction'', Joseph Dan, Oxford University Press, chapter "Early modern era: Safed spirituality"&lt;/ref&gt; Through this, in [[Hasidic Judaism]] the ultimate essential "desire" of God is the revelation of the Omnipresent Divine essence through materiality, achieved by man from within his limited physical realm, when the body will give life to the soul.&lt;ref&gt;Habad intellectual Hasidic thought: source text [[Tanya]] I: 36, 49; secondary text ''Heaven On Earth'', Faitel Levin, Kehot publications&lt;/ref&gt;

====Christianity====
[[File:Cristo Redentor - Rio.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Christ the Redeemer (statue)|Christ the Redeemer]]'' statue on [[Corcovado (Brazil)|Corcovado]] mountain in [[Rio de Janeiro]] is symbolic of Christianity,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/europe/The-new-Seven-Wonders-of-the-World/235431/Article1-235487.aspx The new Seven Wonders of the World] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209062632/http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/europe/The-new-Seven-Wonders-of-the-World/235431/Article1-235487.aspx |date=9 February 2010 }}. Hindustan Times (2007-07-08). Retrieved on 2013-10-29.&lt;/ref&gt; illustrating the concept of seeking [[redemption (theology)|redemption]] through [[Jesus Christ]].]]

[[Christianity]] has its roots in Judaism, and shares much of the latter faith's [[ontology]]. Its central beliefs derive from the teachings of [[Jesus Christ]] as presented in the [[New Testament]]. Life's purpose in Christianity is to seek divine [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]] through the grace of God and intercession of Christ ([[Gospel of John|John]] 11:26). The New Testament speaks of God wanting to have a relationship with humans both in this life and the life to come, which can happen only if one's [[Atonement in Christianity|sins are forgiven]] (John 3:16–21; 2 Peter 3:9).

In the Christian view, humankind was made in the [[Image of God]] and perfect, but the [[Fall of Man]] caused the progeny of the [[Adam and Eve|first Parents]] to inherit [[Original Sin]] and its consequences. Christ's [[Passion of Jesus|passion]], [[Crucifixion of Jesus|death]] and [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] provide the means for transcending that impure state ([[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 6:23). The good news that this restoration from sin is now possible is called the [[gospel]]. The specific process of appropriating salvation through Christ and maintaining a relationship with God varies between different [[List of Christian denominations|denominations]] of Christians, but all rely on faith in Christ and the gospel as the fundamental starting point. Salvation through faith in God is found in [[Epistle to the Ephesians|Ephesians]] 2:8–9 – "&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt;For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; &lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;not as a result of works, that no one should boast" ([[New American Standard Bible|NASB]]; 1973). The gospel maintains that through this belief, the barrier that sin has created between man and God is destroyed, thereby allowing God to [[Regeneration (theology)|regenerate]] (change) the believer and instill in them a new heart after God's own will with the ability to live righteously before him. This is what the terms ''[[Born again]]'' or ''saved'' almost always refer to.

In the ''[[Westminster Shorter Catechism]]'', the first question is: "What is the chief end of Man?" (that is, "What is Man's main purpose?"). The answer is: "Man's chief end is to glorify God, and enjoy him forever". God requires one to obey the revealed moral law, saying: "love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbour as yourself".&lt;ref name="Westminster"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Westminster Shorter Catechism |url=http://www.creeds.net/reformed/Westminster/shorter_catechism.html |accessdate=2008-03-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311000717/http://www.creeds.net/reformed/Westminster/shorter_catechism.html |archive-date=11 March 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Baltimore Catechism]]'' answers the question "Why did God make you?" by saying "God made me to know Him, to love Him, and to serve Him in this world, and to be happy with Him forever in heaven."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Baltimore Catechism |url= http://www.sacred-texts.com/chr/balt/balt1.htm |accessdate=2008-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Apostle Paul also answers this question in his speech on the [[Areopagus]] in [[Athens]]: "And He has made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, and has determined their preappointed times and the boundaries of their dwellings, so that they should seek the Lord, in the hope that they might grope for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us."&lt;ref&gt;[[Bible]], [[Acts]] 17:26–27, [[NKJV]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Catholicism]]'s way of thinking is better expressed through the Principle and Foundation of [[St. Ignatius of Loyola]]: "The human person is created to praise, reverence, and serve God Our Lord, and by doing so, to save his or her soul. All other things on the face of the earth are created for human beings in order to help them pursue the end for which they are created. It follows from this that one must use other created things, in so far as they help towards one's end, and free oneself from them, in so far as they are obstacles to one's end. To do this, we need to make ourselves indifferent to all created things, provided the matter is subject to our free choice and there is no other prohibition. Thus, as far as we are concerned, we should not want health more than illness, wealth more than poverty, fame more than disgrace, a long life more than a short one, and similarly for all the rest, but we should desire and choose only what helps us more towards the end for which we are created."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/prs/stign/ignatian_spirit.html St. Ignatius | Ignatian Spirituality].

[[Mormonism]] teaches that the purpose of life on Earth is to gain knowledge and experience and to have joy.&lt;ref name="Gospel Principles"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lds.org/manual/gospel-principles|title=Gospel Principles|website=Lds.org|accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mormons believe that humans are literally the spirit children of God the Father, and thus have the potential to progress to become like Him. Mormons teach that God provided his children the choice to come to Earth, which is considered a crucial stage in their development—wherein a mortal body, coupled with the freedom to choose, makes for an environment to learn and grow.&lt;ref name="Gospel Principles"/&gt; The Fall of Adam is not viewed as an unfortunate or unplanned cancellation of God's original plan for a paradise; rather, the opposition found in mortality is an essential element of God's plan because the process of enduring and overcoming challenges, difficulties, and temptations provides opportunities to gain wisdom and strength, thereby learning to appreciate and choose good and reject evil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.11#10 2 Nephi 2:11].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.55#54 Moses 6:55].&lt;/ref&gt; Because God is just, he allows those who were not taught the gospel during mortality to receive it after death in the spirit world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/138|title=Doctrine and Covenants 138|work=lds.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that all of his children have the opportunity to return to live with God, and reach their full potential.

A recent alternative Christian theological discourse interprets Jesus as revealing that the purpose of life is to elevate our compassionate response to human suffering;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Drake-Brockman|first=Tom|title=Christian Humanism: the compassionate theology of a Jew called Jesus|date=2012|url=http://christianhumanism.webs.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  nonetheless, the conventional Christian position is that people are justified by belief in the [[Propitiation|propitiatory sacrifice]] of Jesus' death on the cross.

[[Hinduism]] is a religious category including many beliefs and traditions. Since Hinduism was the way of expressing meaningful living for a long time, before there was a need for naming it as a separate religion, Hindu doctrines are supplementary and complementary in nature, generally non-exclusive, suggestive and tolerant in content.&lt;ref name="weightman"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Simon Weightman |date=1998 |title=The new Penguin handbook of living religions |editor=Hinnells, John |publisher=[[Penguin books]] |chapter=Hinduism |isbn=978-0140514803}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most believe that the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|ātman]] (spirit, soul)—the person's true ''self''—is eternal.&lt;ref name="monierwilliams"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Monier Monier-Williams |authorlink=Monier Monier-Williams |date=1974 |title=Brahmanism and Hinduism: Or, Religious Thought and Life in India, as Based on the Veda and Other Sacred Books of the Hindus |publisher=Adamant Media Corporation |url=https://books.google.com/?id=U5IBXA4UpT0C&amp;dq=isbn=1421265311 |accessdate= 2007-07-08 |series=Elibron Classics |isbn=978-1421265315}}&lt;/ref&gt; In part, this stems from Hindu beliefs that spiritual development occurs across many lifetimes, and goals should match the state of development of the individual. There are four possible aims to human life, known as the ''[[purusharthas]]'' (ordered from least to greatest): (i)''[[Kāma]]'' (wish, desire, love and sensual pleasure), (ii)''[[Artha]]'' (wealth, prosperity, glory), (iii)''[[Dharma]]'' (righteousness, duty, morality, [[virtue]], [[ethics]]), encompassing notions such as ''[[ahimsa]]'' (non-violence) and [[satya]] (truth) and (iv)''[[Moksha]]'' (liberation, i.e. liberation from [[Saṃsāra]], the cycle of [[reincarnation]]).&lt;ref&gt;For dharma, artha, and kama as "brahmanic householder values" see: Flood (1996), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For the ''Dharma Śāstras'' as discussing the "four main goals of life" (dharma, artha, {{IAST|kāma}}, and moksha) see: Hopkins, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For definition of the term पुरुष-अर्थ ({{IAST|puruṣa-artha}}) as "any of the four principal objects of human life, i.e. {{lang|sa|धर्म}}, {{lang|sa|अर्थ}}, {{lang|sa|काम}}, and {{lang|sa|मोक्ष}}" see: Apte, p. 626, middle column, compound #1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In all schools of Hinduism, the meaning of life is tied up in the concepts of [[karma]] (causal action), [[sansara]] (the cycle of birth and rebirth), and [[moksha]] (liberation). Existence is conceived as the progression of the ātman (similar to the western concept of a [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]) across numerous lifetimes, and its ultimate progression towards liberation from karma. Particular goals for life are generally subsumed under broader [[yoga]]s (practices) or [[dharma]] (correct living) which are intended to create more favorable reincarnations, though they are generally positive acts in this life as well. Traditional schools of Hinduism often worship [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] which are manifestations of [[Ishvara]] (a personal or chosen God); these Devas are taken as ideal forms to be identified with, as a form of spiritual improvement.

In short, the goal is to realize the fundamental truth about oneself.  This thought is conveyed in the [[Mahāvākyas]] ("[[Tat Tvam Asi]]" (thou art that),  "Aham Brahmāsmi", "Prajñānam Brahma" and "Ayam Ātmā Brahma" (the soul and the world are one)).

=====Advaita and Dvaita Hinduism=====
{{Further information|Advaita Vedanta|Dvaita Vedanta}}
Later schools reinterpreted the [[vedas]] to focus on [[Brahman]], "The One Without a Second",&lt;ref name="bhaskaranandaessential"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Bhaskarananda |first=Swami |date=1994 |title=The Essentials of Hinduism: a comprehensive overview of the world's oldest religion |place=Seattle, WA |publisher=Viveka Press |isbn=978-1884852022}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a central God-like figure.

In [[monist]] Advaita Vedanta, ātman is ultimately indistinguishable from Brahman, and the goal of life is to know or realize that one's [[Ātman (Hinduism)|ātman]] (soul) is identical to [[Brahman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Vivekananda |first=Swami |authorlink=Swami Vivekananda |date=1987 |title=Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda |place=Calcutta |publisher=Advaita Ashrama |isbn=978-8185301754}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the [[Upanishads]], whoever becomes fully aware of the ātman, as one's core of self, realizes identity with Brahman, and, thereby, achieves [[Moksha]] (liberation, freedom).&lt;ref name="monierwilliams"/&gt;&lt;ref name="werner"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Werner |first=Karel |date=1994 |title=A Popular Dictionary of Hinduism |place=Richmond, Surrey |editor=Hinnells, John (Ed.) |publisher=Curzon Press |chapter=Hinduism |isbn= 978-0700702794}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also the Vedic statement "ayam ātmā brahma" (This [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Ātman]] is [[Brahman]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Dvaita Vedanta and other [[bhakti]] schools have a [[Theistic dualism|dualist]] interpretation. [[Brahman]] is seen as a supreme being with a personality and manifest qualities. The ātman depends upon Brahman for its existence; the meaning of life is achieving Moksha through love of God and upon His grace.&lt;ref name="werner"/&gt;

=====Vaishnavism=====
[[Vaishnavism]] is a branch of Hinduism in which the principal belief is the identification of [[Vishnu]] or [[Narayana]] as the one supreme God. This belief contrasts with the [[Krishnaism|Krishna-centered]] traditions, such as [[Vallabha]], [[Nimbaraka]] and [[Gaudiya]], in which [[Krishna]] is considered to be the One and only Supreme God and the [[Svayam Bhagavan|source of all avataras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

| title = Caitanya Vaisnava Vedanta of Jiva Gosvami: When knowledge meets devotion
| publisher = Routledge
| isbn = 978-0415405485
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vaishnava theology includes the central beliefs of Hinduism such as [[monotheism]], [[reincarnation]], [[samsara]], [[karma]], and the various [[Yoga]] systems, but with a particular emphasis on devotion ([[bhakti]]) to Vishnu through the process of [[Bhakti yoga]], often including singing Vishnu's name's ([[bhajan]]), meditating upon his form ([[dharana]]) and performing [[deity]] worship ([[puja (Hinduism)|puja]]). The practices of deity worship are primarily based on texts such as [[Pañcaratra]] and various [[Samhita (disambiguation)|Samhita]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vnn.org/editorials/ET9901/ET05-2795.html Tantric Literature And Gaudiya Vaishnavism] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525061446/http://www.vnn.org/editorials/ET9901/ET05-2795.html |date=25 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One popular school of thought, [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism]], teaches the concept of [[Achintya Bheda Abheda]]. In this, Krishna is worshipped as the single true God, and all living entities are eternal parts and the Supreme Personality of the Godhead Krishna. Thus the constitutional position of a living entity is to serve the Lord with love and devotion. The purpose of human life especially is to think beyond the animalistic way of eating, sleeping, mating and defending and engage the higher intelligence to revive the lost relationship with Krishna.

====Jainism====

{{Further information|Jainism|Jain philosophy}}

[[Jainism]] is a religion originating in [[Iron Age India|ancient India]], its ethical system promotes self-discipline above all else. Through following the [[asceticism|ascetic]] teachings of [[Tirthankara|Jina]], a [[human]] achieves [[Moksa (Jainism)|enlightenment (perfect knowledge)]]. Jainism divides the universe into living and non-living beings. Only when the living become attached to the non-living does suffering result. Therefore, happiness is the result of self-conquest and freedom from external objects. The meaning of life may then be said to be to use the physical body to achieve self-realization and bliss.&lt;ref&gt;Shah, Natubhai. ''Jainism: The World of Conquerors.'' Sussex Academic Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jains believe that every human is responsible for his or her actions and all living beings have an eternal [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], ''[[jiva]]''. Jains believe all souls are equal because they all possess the potential of being liberated and attaining [[Moksa (Jainism)|Moksha]]. The [[Karma in Jainism|Jain view of karma]] is that every action, every word, every thought produces, besides its visible, an invisible, transcendental effect on the soul.

Jainism includes strict adherence to [[Ahimsa in Jainism|ahimsa]] (or ''ahinsā''), a form of [[nonviolence]] that goes far beyond [[vegetarianism]]. Jains refuse food obtained with unnecessary cruelty. Many practice a lifestyle similar to [[veganism]] due to the violence of modern dairy farms, and others exclude [[root vegetable]]s from their diets in order to preserve the lives of the plants from which they eat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.retoday.org.uk/pdfs/dre/viren.pdf |title=Viren, Jain |accessdate=2007-06-14 |publisher= RE Today|format=PDF}}, [http://www.retoday.org.uk/ RE Today] &lt;/ref&gt;

====Buddhism====

===== Earlier Buddhism =====
Buddhists practice to embrace with mindfulness the ill-being (suffering) and well-being that is present in life. Buddhists practice to see the causes of ill-being and well-being in life. For example, one of the causes of suffering is unhealthy attachment to objects material or non-material. The Buddhist [[sūtras]] and [[tantras]] do not speak about "the meaning of life" or "the purpose of life", but about the potential of human life to end suffering, for example through embracing (not suppressing or denying) cravings and conceptual attachments. Attaining and perfecting dispassion is a process of many levels that ultimately results in the state of [[Nirvana]]. Nirvana means freedom from both [[Dukkha|suffering]] and [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Four Noble Truths |url=http://www.thebigview.com/buddhism/fourtruths.html |publisher=Thebigview.com |accessdate=2009-11-06 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091111202249/http://www.thebigview.com/buddhism/fourtruths.html |archivedate=2009-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dharma Wheel.svg|thumb|left|The eight-spoked [[Dharmachakra]]]]
[[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]] is generally considered to be close to the early Buddhist practice. It promotes the concept of [[Vibhajjavada]] ([[Pāli|Pali]]), literally "Teaching of Analysis", which says that insight must come from the aspirant's experience, critical investigation, and reasoning instead of by blind faith. However, the Theravadin tradition also emphasizes heeding the advice of the wise, considering such advice and evaluation of one's own experiences to be the two tests by which practices should be judged. The Theravadin goal is liberation (or freedom) from suffering, according to the [[Four Noble Truths]]. This is attained in the achievement of [[Nirvana]], or Unbinding which also ends the [[reincarnation|repeated cycle]] of birth, old age, sickness and death. The way to attain Nirvana is by following and practicing the [[Noble Eightfold Path]].

=====Mahayana Buddhism=====
{{Further information|Mahayana}}
Mahayana Buddhist schools de-emphasize the traditional view (still practiced in [[Theravada]]) of the release from individual Suffering ([[Dukkha]]) and attainment of Awakening (Nirvana). In Mahayana, the Buddha is seen as an eternal, immutable, inconceivable, [[omnipresent]] being. The fundamental principles of Mahayana doctrine are based on the possibility of universal liberation from suffering for all beings, and the existence of the transcendent [[Buddha-nature]], which is the eternal Buddha essence present, but hidden and unrecognised, in all living beings.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Philosophical schools of Mahayana Buddhism, such as [[zen|Chan/Zen]] and the [[vajrayana]] Tibetan and Shingon schools, explicitly teach that [[bodhisattva]]s should refrain from full liberation, allowing themselves to be reincarnated into the world until all beings achieve enlightenment. Devotional schools such as [[Pure Land]] Buddhism seek the aid of celestial buddhas—individuals who have spent lifetimes{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} accumulating positive karma, and use that accumulation to aid all.

====Sikhism====
[[File:Khanda.svg|thumb|The [[Khanda (religious symbol)|Khanda]], an important symbol of [[Sikhism]].]]

The monotheistic [[Sikhism|Sikh]] religion was founded by [[Guru Nanak Dev]], the term "Sikh" means student, which denotes that followers will lead their lives forever learning. This system of religious [[philosophy]] and expression has been traditionally known as the [[Gurmat]] (literally "the counsel of the gurus") or the Sikh Dharma. The followers of Sikhism are ordained to follow the teachings of the ten [[Sikh Gurus]], or enlightened leaders, as well as the holy scripture entitled the ''[[Gurū Granth Sāhib]]'', which includes selected works of many philosophers from diverse socio-economic and religious backgrounds.

The Sikh Gurus say that salvation can be obtained by following various spiritual paths, so Sikhs do not have a monopoly on salvation: "The Lord dwells in every heart, and every heart has its own way to reach Him."&lt;ref name="Singh"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Daljeet Singh |title=Guru Tegh Bahadur |publisher=Language Dept., Punjab |date=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sikhs believe that all people are equally important before [[Waheguru|God]].&lt;ref name="Mayled"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Jon Mayled |title=Modern World Religions: Sikhism |publisher=Harcourt Heinemann |date=2002 |isbn=978-0435336264}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sikhs balance their moral and spiritual values with the quest for knowledge, and they aim to promote a life of peace and equality but also of positive action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sikhcoalition.org|title=The Sikh Coalition|work=sikhcoalition.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A key distinctive feature of Sikhism is a non-[[Anthropomorphism#In religion and mythology|anthropomorphic]] concept of God, to the extent that one can interpret God as the [[Universe]] itself ([[pantheism]]). Sikhism thus sees life as an opportunity to understand this God as well as to discover the divinity which lies in each individual.   While a full understanding of God is beyond human beings,&lt;ref name="p252"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Parrinder |first=Geoffrey |authorlink=Geoffrey Parrinder |date=1971 |title=World Religions: From Ancient History to the Present |publisher=Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited |location=United States |isbn=978-0871961297}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guru Nanak Dev|Nanak]] described God as not wholly unknowable, and stressed that God must be seen from "the inward eye", or the "heart", of a human being: devotees must [[meditate]] to progress towards enlightenment and the ultimate destination of a Sikh is to lose the ego completely in the love of the lord and finally merge into the almighty creator. Nanak emphasized the revelation through meditation, as its rigorous application permits the existence of communication between God and human beings.&lt;ref name="p252"/&gt;

===East Asian religions===

====Taoism====
[[File:Yin yang.svg|thumb|''[[Taijitu]]'' symbolizes the [[unity of opposites]] between yin and yang.]]

[[Taoist]] [[cosmogony]] emphasizes the need for all sentient beings and all man to return to the ''primordial'' or to rejoin with the ''Oneness'' of the Universe by way of self-cultivation and self-realization. All adherents should understand and be in tune with the ultimate truth.

Taoists believe all things were originally from [[Taiji (philosophy)|Taiji]] and [[Tao]], and the meaning in life for the adherents is to realize the temporal nature of the existence. "Only introspection can then help us to find our innermost reasons for living ... the simple answer is here within ourselves."&lt;ref name="Ming-Dao"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Ming-Dao Deng |title=Scholar Warrior: An Introduction to the Tao in Everyday Life |publisher=HarperCollins |date=1990 |isbn=978-0062502322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Shinto====
[[File:Shinto torii vermillion.svg|thumb|Shinto [[torii]], a traditional Japanese gate]]

[[Shinto]] is the native religion of Japan. Shinto means "the path of the [[kami]]", but more specifically, it can be taken to mean "the divine crossroad where the kami chooses his way". The "divine" crossroad signifies that all the universe is divine spirit. This foundation of [[free will]], choosing one's way, means that life is a creative process.

Shinto wants life to live, not to die. Shinto sees death as pollution and regards life as the realm where the divine spirit seeks to purify itself by rightful self-development. Shinto wants individual human life to be prolonged forever on earth as a victory of the divine spirit in preserving its objective personality in its highest forms. The presence of evil in the world, as conceived by Shinto, does not stultify the divine nature by imposing on divinity responsibility for being able to relieve human suffering while refusing to do so. The sufferings of life are the sufferings of the divine spirit in search of progress in the objective world.&lt;ref name="Mason"&gt;{{Cite book |author=J.W.T. Mason |title=The Meaning of Shinto |publisher=Trafford Publishing |date=2002 |isbn=978-1412245517}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New religions====
There are many [[new religious movements]] in East Asia, and some with millions of followers: [[Chondogyo]], [[Tenrikyo]], [[Cao Đài]], and [[Seicho-No-Ie]]. New religions typically have unique explanations for the meaning of life. For example, in Tenrikyo, one is expected to live a [[Joyous Life]] by participating in practices that create happiness for oneself and others.

==In popular culture==
[[File:Allisvanity.jpg|thumb|[[Charles Allan Gilbert]]'s ''All is Vanity,'' an example of ''[[vanitas]],'' depicts a young [[woman]] amidst her makeup and perfumes, preoccupied with her own beauty at the [[mirror]] of her [[lowboy|vanity]]. But all is positioned in such a way as to make the image of a [[human skull|skull]] appear, expressing ''[[memento mori]]'', that no matter how good she looks, it won't last, as death is inevitable.]]

The mystery of life and its true meaning is an often recurring subject in [[popular culture]], featured in [[mass media|entertainment media]] and [[the arts|various forms]] of [[art]].

In ''[[Monty Python's The Meaning of Life]]'', there are several allusions to the meaning of life. At the end of the film, a character played by [[Michael Palin]] is handed an envelope containing "the meaning of life", which she opens and reads out to the audience: "Well, it's nothing very special. Uh, try to be nice to people, avoid eating fat, read a good book every now and then, get some walking in, and try to live together in peace and harmony with people of all creeds and nations."&lt;ref name="useless website"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intriguing.com/mp/_scripts/meanlife.asp|title=Monty Python's Completely Useless Web Site: Monty Python's The Meaning Of Life: Complete Script|work=intriguing.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Burnham"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Terry Burnham |title=Mean Markets and Lizard Brains: How to Profit from the New Science of Irrationality |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |date=2005 |isbn=978-0471716952}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fernandez"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Yolanda Fernandez |title=In Their Shoes: Examining the Issue of Empathy and Its Place in the Treatment of Offenders |publisher=Wood 'N' Barnes Publishing |date=2002 |isbn=978-1885473486}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other Python sketches and songs are also existential in nature, questioning the importance we place on life ("[[Always Look on the Bright Side of Life]]") and other meaning-of-life related questioning. John Cleese also had his sit-com character [[Basil Fawlty]] contemplating the futility of his own existence in [[Fawlty Towers]].

In [[Douglas Adams]]' popular comedy book, movie, television, and radio series ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', the [[Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything]] is given the numeric solution "[[42 (number)|42]]", after seven and a half million years of calculation by a giant [[supercomputer]] called [[Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Deep Thought|Deep Thought]]. When this answer is met with confusion and anger from its constructors, Deep Thought explains that "I think the problem such as it was, was too broadly based. You never actually stated what the question was."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adams|first1=Douglas|title=The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy (Fit the Fourth)|publisher=BBC Radio 4|language=English|format=Audio, Radio|date=1978-03-29|quote=I think the problem such as it was, was too broadly based.

Deep Thought then constructs another computer—the Earth—to calculate what the Ultimate Question actually is. 
Later Ford and Arthur manage to extract the question as the Earth computer would have rendered it. That question turns out to be "what do you get if you multiply six by nine"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adams|first1=Douglas|title=The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy (Fit the Sixth)|publisher=BBC Radio 4|format=Audio, Radio|date=1978-04-12|quote=That’s it. Six by nine… forty-two! I always said there was something fundamentally wrong about the universe!}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and it is realised that [[Garbage_in,_garbage_out|the program was ruined by the unexpected arrival of the Golgafrinchans]] on Earth, and so the actual Ultimate Question Of Life, The Universe, And Everything remains unknown. While 6 x 9 would be written as 42 in the [[List_of_numeral_systems#Standard_positional_numeral_systems|tridecimal numeral system]], author Douglas Adams claimed that this was mere coincidence and completely serendipitous.

[[File:HamletSkullHCSealous.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hamlet]] meditating upon [[Yorick]]'s skull has become the most lasting embodiment of the imagery of [[vanitas]], conveying the theme ''[[memento mori]]'' ('Remember you shall die'). Whatever the meaning of life, it (life) is fleeting.]]

In ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Homer the Heretic]]", a representation of God agrees to tell Homer what the meaning of life is, but the show's credits begin to roll just as he starts to say what it is.&lt;ref name="Pinsky"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Mark I. Pinsky |title=The Gospel According To The Simpsons: The Spiritual Life Of The World's Most Animated Family |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |date=2001 |isbn=978-0664224196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Red vs. Blue]]'' season 1 episode 1 the character Simmons asks Grif the question "Why are we here?" and is a major line in the series.

In ''[[Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure]]'', the characters are asked how we should live our lives, and reply with a version of the [[golden rule]] `be excellent to each other' followed by 'party on, dudes!'.

In [[Person of Interest (TV series)|''Person of Interest'']] season 5 episode 13, an artificial intelligence referred to as The Machine tells [[Harold Finch (Person of Interest)|Harold Finch]] that the secret of life is  ''"Everyone dies alone. But if you mean something to someone, if you help someone, or love someone. If even a single person remembers you then maybe you never really die at all."'' This phrase is then repeated at the very end of the show to add emphasis to the finale.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===To love, to feel, to enjoy the act of living===
* To love more.&lt;ref name="Seaman" /&gt;
* To love those who mean the most. Every life you touch will touch you back.&lt;ref name="Seaman" /&gt;
* To treasure every enjoyable sensation one has.&lt;ref name="Seaman" /&gt;
* To seek [[beauty]] in all its forms.&lt;ref name="Seaman" /&gt;
* To have fun or enjoy life.&lt;ref name="Cappannelli" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stephan &amp; Pace" /&gt;
* To seek pleasure&lt;ref name="Cook" /&gt; and avoid pain.&lt;ref name="Mitchell"&gt;{{cite book |author=T.W. Mitchell |title=Problems in Psychopathology |publisher=Harcourt, Brace &amp; company, inc. |date=1927}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To be compassionate.&lt;ref name="Cook" /&gt;
* To be moved by the tears and pain of others, and try to help them out of love and compassion.&lt;ref name="Seaman" /&gt;

* To eat, drink, and be merry.&lt;ref name="Ecclesiastes8:15"&gt;{{Bibleverse|Ecclesiastes|8|15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===To have power, to be better===
* To [[will to power|strive for power]]&lt;ref name="Reginster" /&gt; and superiority.&lt;ref name="Mitchell" /&gt;
* To rule the world.&lt;ref name="West"&gt;{{cite book |author=John G. West |title=Celebrating Middle-Earth: The Lord of the Rings as a Defense of Western Civilization |publisher=Inkling Books |date=2002 |isbn=978-1587420122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Life has no meaning===
* Life or human existence has no real meaning or purpose because human existence occurred out of a random [[contingency (philosophy)|chance]] in nature, and anything that exists by chance has no intended purpose.&lt;ref name="Tang" /&gt;
* Life has no meaning, but as humans we try to associate a meaning or purpose so we can justify our existence.&lt;ref name="Seaman" /&gt;
* There is no point in life, and that is exactly what makes it so special.&lt;ref name="Seaman" /&gt;

===One should not seek to know and understand the meaning of life===
* The answer to the meaning of life is too profound to be known and understood.&lt;ref name="Tang" /&gt;
* You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life.&lt;ref name="Seaman" /&gt;
* The meaning of life is to forget about the search for the meaning of life.&lt;ref name="Seaman" /&gt;
* Ultimately, a person should not ask what the meaning of their life is, but rather must recognize that it is they themselves who are asked. In a word, each person is questioned by life; and they can only answer to life by answering for their own life; to life they can only respond by being responsible.&lt;ref&gt;''Man's Search for Meaning'', Viktor Frankl. Beacon Press, 2006, {{ISBN|978-0807014264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Life is bad===
* Better never to have been. People will always experience pain (harm) which outweighs any pleasure. Not coming into existence means people will not experience pain, nor will they be disadvantaged by not experiencing pleasure as they do not exist. This is described as the asymmetry of pleasure and pain (see [[antinatalism]]).&lt;ref name="Benetar"&gt;{{cite book|last=Benatar|first=David|authorlink=David Benatar|title=Better Never to Have Been – The Harm of Coming into Existence|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0199296422|page=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Microchimerism''' is the presence of a small number of cells that originate from another individual and are therefore genetically distinct from the cells of the host individual. This phenomenon may be related to certain types of [[autoimmune diseases]]; however, the mechanisms responsible for this relationship are unclear.

==Types==

===Human===
In humans (and perhaps in all [[placentals]]), the most common form is '''fetomaternal microchimerism''' (also known as ''fetal cell microchimerism'' or ''fetal chimerism'') whereby cells from a [[fetus]] pass through the [[placenta]] and establish cell lineages within the mother. Fetal cells have been documented to persist and multiply in the mother for several decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bianchi|first=DW|author2=Zickwold GK |author3=Weil GJ |author4=Sylvester S |author5=DeMaria MA. |title=Male fetal progenitor cells persist in maternal blood for as long as 27 years postpartum|journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A|year=1996|volume=93|pages=705–708|doi=10.1073/pnas.93.2.705|pmc=40117|issue=2|pmid=8570620}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Evans PC, Lambert N, Maloney S, Furst DE, Moore JM, Nelson JL | title=Long-term fetal microchimerism in peripheral blood mononuclear cell subsets in healthy women and women with scleroderma| journal=Blood | year=1999 | pages=2033–2037 | volume=93|pmid= 10068676|issue= 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exact [[phenotype]] of these cells is unknown, although several different cell types have been identified, such as various immune lineages, [[mesenchymal stem cells]], and placental-derived cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pritchard |first=Stephanie |author2=Wick HC |author3=Slonim DK |author4=Johnson KL |author5=Bianchi DW |title=Comprehensive analysis of genes expressed by rare microchimeric fetal cells in the maternal mouse lung |journal=Biology of Reproduction |date=August 2012 |volume=87 |pages=42 |pmid=22674387 |url=http://www.biolreprod.org/content/87/2/42.long |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923204002/http://www.biolreprod.org/content/87/2/42.long |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2015-09-23 |issue=2 |doi=10.1095/biolreprod.112.101147 |pmc=3431427 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 study at the [[Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center]], Seattle, has detected cells with the [[Y chromosome]] in multiple areas of the brains of deceased women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Male microchimerism in the human female brain|journal=PLOS ONE|date=26 September 2012|volume=7|issue=9|doi= 10.1371/journal.pone.0045592|pmid=23049819|pages=e45592|pmc=3458919|vauthors=Chan WF, Gurnot C, Montine TJ, Sonnen JA, Guthrie KA, Nelson JL }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fetomaternal microchimerism occurs during pregnancy and shortly after giving birth for most women. However, not all women who have had children contain fetal cells. Studies suggest that fetomaternal microchimerism could be influenced by killer-cell immunoglobin-like (KIR) [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligands]].&lt;ref name="fetomaternal microchimerism" /&gt; [[Lymphocytes]] also influence the development of persisting fetomaternal microchimerism since [[natural killer cells]] compose about 70% of lymphocytes in the first trimester of pregnancy. KIR patterns on maternal natural killer cells of the mother and KIR ligands on the fetal cells could have an effect on fetomaternal microchimerism. In one study, mothers with KIR2DS1 exhibited higher levels of fetomaternal microchimerism compared to mothers who were negative for this activating KIR.&lt;ref name="fetomaternal microchimerism"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kruchen|first1=Anne|last2=Stahl|first2=Tanja|last3=Gieseke|first3=Friederike|last4=Binder|first4=Thomas|last5=Oezcan|first5=Zakir|last6=Meisel|first6=Roland|last7=Kreyenberg|first7=Hermann|last8=Bader|first8=Peter|last9=Gruhn|first9=Bernd|last10=Greil|first10=Johann|last11=Pfeieffer|first11=Matthias|last12=Doering|first12=Michaela|last13=Handgretinger|first13=Rupert|last14=Fehse|first14=Boris|last15=Mueller|first15=Ingo|title=Fetomaternal Microchimerism Is Associated with Better Outcome in Haploidentical Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation|journal=Blood|date=2014|volume=124|issue=21|url=http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/124/21/1242.abstract?sso-checked=true|accessdate=3 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The potential health consequences of these cells are unknown. One hypothesis is that these fetal cells might trigger a [[Graft-versus-host disease|graft-versus-host reaction]] leading to [[autoimmune disease]]. This offers a potential explanation for why many autoimmune diseases are more prevalent in middle-aged women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nelson|first=JL|title=Maternal-fetal immunology and autoimmune disease: is some autoimmune disease auto-alloimmune or allo-autoimmune?|journal=Arthritis Rheum|year=1996|volume=39|issue=2|pages=191–194|doi=10.1002/art.1780390203|pmid=8849367}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another hypothesis is that fetal cells home to injured or diseased maternal tissue where they act as [[stem cells]] and participate in repair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Khosrotehrani|first=K|author2=Johnson KL |author3=Cha DH |author4=Salomon RN |author5=Bianchi DW |title=Transfer of fetal cells with multilineage potential to maternal tissue|journal=Journal of the American Medical Association|year=2004|volume=292|pages=75–80|doi=10.1001/jama.292.1.75|pmid=15238593|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nguyen Huu|first=S|last2=Oster |first2=M |last3=Avril |first3=MF |last4=Boitier |first4=F |last5=Mortier |first5=L |last6=Richard |first6=MA |last7=Kerob |first7=D |last8=Maubec |first8=E |last9=Souteyrand |first9=P |last10=Moguelet |first10=P |last11=Khosrotehrani |first11=K |last12=Aractingi |first12=S |title=Fetal microchimeric cells participate in tumour angiogenesis in melanomas occurring during pregnancy|journal=Am J Cardiovasc Pathol|year=2009|volume=174|issue=2|pages=630–637|doi=10.2353/ajpath.2009.080566|pmc=2630570}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also possible that the fetal cells are merely innocent bystanders and have no effect on maternal health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=KL|author2=Bianchi DW|title=Fetal cells in maternal tissue following pregnancy: what are the consequences?|journal=Hum Reprod Update|year=2004|volume=10|issue=6|pages=497–502|doi=10.1093/humupd/dmh040|pmid=15319378}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After giving birth, about 50–75% of women carry fetal immune cell lines. Maternal immune cells are also found in the offspring yielding in '''maternal→fetal microchimerism''', though this phenomenon is about half as frequent as the former.&lt;ref name="labinvest"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Loubičre LS, Lambert NC, Flinn LJ, Erickson TD, Yan Z, Guthrie KA, etal | title=Maternal microchimerism in healthy adults in lymphocytes, monocyte/macrophages and NK cells| journal= Lab Invest | year=2006| volume=86 | pages=1185–92|pmid= 16969370|issue= 11|doi= 10.1038/labinvest.3700471 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microchimerism had also been shown to exist after [[blood transfusion]]s to a severely [[immunocompromised]] population of patients who suffered [[Physical trauma|trauma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Reed W, Lee TH, Norris PJ, Utter GH, Busch MP | title=Transfusion-associated microchimerism: a new complication of blood transfusions in severely injured patients| journal=Seminars in Hematology | year=2007 | pages=24–31 | volume=44|issue=1|doi=10.1053/j.seminhematol.2006.09.012 | pmid=17198844}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other possible sources of microchimerism include [[gestation]],&lt;ref&gt;Shree, Raj, et al. "Fetal Microchimerism by Mode of Delivery in Healthy Term Gestations." ''REPRODUCTIVE SCIENCES''. Vol. 24. 2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA: SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; an individual's older sibling, twin sibling, or vanished twin, with the cells being received in utero. Fetal-maternal microchimerism is especially prevalent after abortion or miscarriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The influence of fetal loss on the presence of fetal cell microchimerism: a systematic review|first1=Kiarash|last1=Khosrotehrani|first2=Kirby L.|last2=Johnson|first3=Joseph|last3=Lau|first4=Alain|last4=Dupuy|first5=Dong Hyun|last5=Cha|first6=Diana W.|last6=Bianchi|date=1 November 2003|journal=Arthritis Rheum.|volume=48|issue=11|pages=3237–3241|doi=10.1002/art.11324|pmid=14613289}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is hypothesized that unprotected intercourse with ejaculation may be another source of microchimerism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Male microchimerism in women without sons: quantitative assessment and correlation with pregnancy history|first1=Zhen|last1=Yan|first2=Nathalie C.|last2=Lambert|first3=Katherine A.|last3=Guthrie|first4=Allison J.|last4=Porter|first5=Laurence S.|last5=Loubiere|first6=Margaret M.|last6=Madeleine|first7=Anne M.|last7=Stevens|first8=Heidi M.|last8=Hermes|first9=J.

===Animal===
Microchimerism occurs in most pairs of twins in [[cattle]]. In cattle (and other [[Bovinae|bovine]]s), the [[placenta]]e of fraternal twins usually fuse and the twins share blood circulation, resulting in exchange of cell lines.  If the twins are a male-female pair, the male hormones from the bull calf have the effect of partially masculinising the heifer (female), creating a ''martin heifer'' or ''[[freemartin]]''.  Freemartins appear female, but are infertile and so cannot be used for breeding or [[dairy farming|dairy production]].  Microchimerism provides a method of diagnosing the condition, because male genetic material can be detected in a blood sample.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theriojournal.com/article/0093-691X(95)00039-B/abstract A. Fujishiro, K. Kawakura, Y-I. Miyake, Y. Kaneda, "A fast, convenient diagnosis of the bovine freemartin syndrome using polymerase chain reaction", ''Theriogenology'', '''43''' (5), pp 883–891 (1 April 1995)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with autoimmune diseases and breast cancer==
Microchimerism has been implicated in autoimmune diseases. Independent studies repeatedly suggested that microchimeric cells of fetal origin may be involved in the [[pathogenesis]] of [[systemic sclerosis]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Artlett CM, Smith JB, Jimenez SA | title=Identification of fetal DNA and cells in skin lesions from women with systemic sclerosis| journal=New England Journal of Medicine| year=1998 | pages=1186–1196|issue= 17|pmid= 9554859 | volume=338|doi= 10.1056/NEJM199804233381704 | url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/338/17/1186}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, microchimeric cells of maternal origin may be involved in the pathogenesis of a group of autoimmune diseases found in children, i.e. juvenile idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (one example would be [[juvenile dermatomyositis]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Artlett CM, Ramos R, Jimenez SA, Patterson K, Miller FW, Rider LG | title=Chimeric cells of maternal origin in juvenile idiopathic inflammatory myopathies. Childhood Myositis Heterogeneity Collaborative Group| journal=Lancet| year=2000 | pages=2155–2156 | volume=356|doi= 10.1016/S0140-6736(00)03499-1|pmid= 11191545|issue= 9248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microchimerism has now been further implicated in other autoimmune diseases, including [[Lupus erythematosus|systemic lupus erythematosus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Johnson KL, McAlindon TE, Mulcahy E, Bianchi DW | title=Microchimerism in a female patient with systemic lupus erythematosus| journal=Arthritis &amp; Rheumatism| year=2001 | pages=2107–2111 | volume=44|doi= 10.1002/1529-0131(200109)44:9&lt;2107::AID-ART361&gt;3.0.CO;2-9 | url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/85512936/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0|issue= 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrarily, an alternative hypothesis on the role of microchimeric cells in lesions is that they may be facilitating tissue repair of the damaged organ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Gilliam AC | title=Microchimerism and skin disease: true-true unrelated?| journal=Journal of Investigative Dermatology | year=2006 | pages=239–241 | volume=126|doi= 10.1038/sj.jid.5700061|pmid= 16418731|issue= 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, fetal immune cells have also been frequently found in breast cancer stroma as compared to samples taken from healthy women. It is not clear, however, whether fetal cell lines promote the development of tumors or, contrarily, protect women from developing breast carcinoma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Gadi VK, Nelson JL | title=Fetal microchimerism in women with breast cancer| journal=Cancer Research | year=2007| pages=9035–9038 | volume=67|doi= 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-4209|pmid= 17909006|issue= 19 | url=http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/content/full/67/19/9035}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dubernard G, etal | title=Breast cancer stroma frequently recruits fetal derived cells during pregnancy| journal=Breast Cancer Research | year=2008| pages=R14 | volume=10|doi= 10.1186/bcr1860|pmid= 18271969|issue= 1|pmc= 2374970 | url=http://breast-cancer-research.com/content/10/1/R14#B38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Systemic lupus erythematosus===

The presence of fetal cells in mothers can be associated with benefits when it comes to certain autoimmune diseases. In particular, male fetal cells are related to helping mothers with [[systemic lupus erythematosus]]. When kidney biopsies were taken from patients with lupus nephritis, DNA was extracted and run with [[PCR]]. The male fetal DNA was quantified and the presence of specific Y chromosome sequences were found. Women with lupus nephritis containing male fetal cells in their kidney biopsies exhibited better [[renal system]] functioning. Levels of [[serum creatinine]], which is related to kidney failure, were low in mothers with high levels of male fetal cells.&lt;ref name="systemic lupus" /&gt; In contrast, women without male fetal cells who had lupus nephritis showed a more serious form of [[glomerulonephritis]] and higher levels of serum creatinine.&lt;ref name="systemic lupus"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Florim|first1=Greiciane|last2=Cardas|first2=Helosia|last3=de Melo|first3=Julio|last4=Baptista|first4=Maria Alice|last5=Fernandes|first5=Ida|last6=Savoldi-Barbosa|first6=Marcela|last7=Goldman|first7=Gustavo|last8=Abbud-Filho|first8=Mario|title=Fetal microchimerism in kidney biopsies of lupus nephritis patients may be associated with a beneficial effect|journal=Arthritis Research &amp; Therapy|volume=17|date=15 April 2015|url=https://arthritis-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13075-015-0615-4|accessdate=3 December 2016|doi=10.1186/s13075-015-0615-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The specific role that fetal cells play in microchimerism related to certain autoimmune diseases is not fully understood. However, one hypothesis states that these cells supply [[antigens]], causing inflammation and triggering the release of different foreign antigens.&lt;ref name="systemic lupus" /&gt; This would trigger autoimmune disease instead of serving as a therapeutic. A different hypothesis states that fetal microchimeric cells are involved in repairing tissues. When tissues get inflamed, fetal microchimeric cells go to the damaged site and aid in repair and regeneration of the tissue.&lt;ref name="systemic lupus" /&gt;

===Thyroid disease===

Fetal maternal microchimerism may be related to autoimmune thyroid diseases. There have been reports of fetal cells in the lining of the blood and thyroid glands of patients with autoimmune thyroid disease. These cells could become activated after delivery of the baby after immune suppression in the mother is lost, suggesting a role of fetal cells in the pathogenesis of such diseases.&lt;ref name="thyroid" /&gt; Two types of thyroid disease, [[Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis]] (HT) and [[Graves Disease|Graves’ Disease]] (GD) show similarities to [[graft vs host disease]] which occurs after [[hematopoietic stem cell]] transplants. Fetal cells colonize maternal tissues like the thyroid gland and are able to survive many years postpartum. These fetal microchimeric cells in the thyroid show up in the blood of women affected by thyroid diseases.&lt;ref name="thyroid"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lepez |first1=Trees |last2=Vandewoestyne |first2=Mado |last3=Deforce |first3=Dieter |title=Fetal microchimeric cells in autoimmune thyroid diseases |journal=Chimerism |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=111–118 |date=20 May 2013 |doi=10.4161/chim.25055 |pmc=3921191 |pmid=23723083}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stem cells==

===Animal models===

Fetomaternal microchimerism has been shown in experimental investigations of whether fetal cells can cross the blood brain barrier in mice. The properties of these cells allow them to cross the blood brain barrier and target injured brain tissue.&lt;ref name="stem cells (mice)" /&gt; This mechanism is possible because [[umbilical cord]] blood cells express some proteins similar to [[neurons]]. When these umbilical cord blood cells are injected in rats with brain injury or stroke, they enter the brain and express certain nerve cell markers. Due to this process, fetal cells could enter the brain during pregnancy and become differentiated into neural cells. Fetal microchimerism can occur in the maternal mouse brain, responding to certain cues in the maternal body.&lt;ref name="stem cells (mice)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tan|first1=Xiao-Wei|last2=Liao|first2=Hong|last3=Sun|first3=Li|last4=Okabe|first4=Masaru|last5=Xiao|first5=Zhi-Cheng|last6=Dawe|first6=Gavin|title=Fetal Microchimerism in the Maternal Mouse Brain: A Novel Population of Fetal Progenitor or Stem Cells Able to Cross the Blood–Brain Barrier?|journal=Stem Cells|date=1 November 2005|volume=23|issue=10|pages=1443–1452|doi=10.1634/stemcells.2004-0169|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1634/stemcells.2004-0169/full|accessdate=3 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health implications==

Fetal microchimerism could have an implication on maternal health. Isolating cells in cultures can alter the properties of the stem cells, but in pregnancy the effects of fetal stem cells can be investigated without in vitro cultures. Once characterized and isolated, fetal cells that are able to cross the blood brain barrier could impact certain procedures.&lt;ref name="stem cells (mice)" /&gt; For example, isolating stem cells can be accomplished through taking them from sources like the umbilical cord. These fetal stem cells can be used in intravenous infusion to repair the brain tissue. Hormonal changes in pregnancy alter neurogenesis, which could create favorable environments for fetal cells to respond to injury.&lt;ref name="stem cells (mice)" /&gt;

The true function on fetal cells in mothers is not fully known, however, there have been reports of positive and negative health effects. The sharing of genes between the fetus and mother may lead to benefits. Due to not all genes being shared, health complications may arise as a result of resource allocation.&lt;ref name="maternal health" /&gt; During pregnancy, fetal cells are able to manipulate the maternal system to draw resources from the placenta, while the maternal system tries to limit it.&lt;ref name="maternal health"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boddy|first1=Amy|last2=Fortunato|first2=Angelo|last3=Wilson Sayres|first3=Melissa|title=Fetal microchimerism and maternal health: A review and evolutionary analysis of cooperation and conflict beyond the womb|journal=BioEssays|volume=37|issue=10|pages=1106–18|date=28 August 2015|doi=10.1002/bies.201500059|pmid=26316378|pmc=4712643}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In '''philosophy''', '''moral conversion''' is an [[Existential humanism|existential]] [[Existential crisis|change]] in the person, who is perceived as the moral agent adopting new moral standards (or [[mores]]) in a process of internal transformation. Moral conversion is a relatively rare event in a person's normal development. It involves a decision that is both conscious and existentialist (i.e. based on critical questioning).{{sfn|Mac Laughlin|2008|p=194}} Moral conversion is based on the [[internalist]] view of [[morality]].{{sfn|Mac Laughlin|2008|p=7}}

==As an existential event==
The process of moral conversion was described by [[Lawrence Kohlberg]] of the [[University of Chicago]], who developed the so-called [[Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development]]. Six classes of moral conversion were identified, based on progressively higher and higher levels of moral reasoning, beginning with the ''preconventional'' level of a child, and concluding with the ''postconventional'' (or autonomous) level of an adult aware of ethical principles guiding universally moral behaviour.{{sfn|Mac Laughlin|2008|p=203}}

Notably, the notion of moral conversion has been distinguished from the theory of moral development ''per se'', by [[Walter E. Conn]] (of [[Villanova University]]) and [[John C. Gibbs]] (of the [[Ohio State University]]).{{sfn|Mac Laughlin|2008|p=205}} Moral conversion, according to Conn and Gibbs, involves critical questioning and therefore differs from any spontaneous moral development (Kohlberg). It results in the setting forth of the "self-chosen values" (Conn), which bring the existential dimension to the transforming process.{{sfn|Mac Laughlin|2008|p=219&amp;ndash;224}}

[[Alfredo J. Mac Laughlin]] of St. Ambrose University defines moral conversion by the frequent occurrence of the "{{nobreak|sharp-turn}} conversions" resulting from the presence of [[free will]], which differ from the natural/spontaneous development taking place in incremental stages (Kohlberg).{{sfn|Mac Laughlin|2008|p=234}} The most significant aspect of moral conversion is the withdrawal from the moral convictions of the past, which is based on "critical self-appropriation" or the ''critical'' discovery of oneself.{{sfn|Mac Laughlin|2008|p=250}} It depends on the sense of authenticity beyond the possibility of predictions.{{sfn|Mac Laughlin|2008|p=253}}

==As self-transcendence==
[[Bernard Lonergan]] explains that moral conversion is not moral perfection. It is the "withdrawal from self-enclosure" or the shift from personal satisfaction criterion to values that transcend oneself (or one's own group interests). Moral conversion, according to Lonergan, is one of three different types of conversion along with the ''intellectual'' and the [[Religious conversion|''religious'' conversion]].{{sfn|Conn|1982}} From a causal point of view, it is the difference between varying levels of consciousness leading to a higher sense of responsibility for the world.{{sfn|Doran|2011|p=13&amp;ndash;18}}

'''Peter Aaby''' ([[Danes|Danish]], born 1944 in [[Lund]], [[Sweden]]) is trained as an [[anthropologist]] but also holds a [[doctoral degree]] in [[medicine]].&lt;ref name="Winkel, 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Winkel|first1=Klaus|title=Danskere i tropisk Afrika : fra slavehandler til bistandsarbejder|date=2011|publisher=Klim|location=Århus|isbn=8779559271|edition=1. udgave.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, Peter Aaby established the [[Bandim Health Project]], a Health and Demographic Surveillance System site in [[Guinea-Bissau]] in [[West Africa]], which he has run ever since.&lt;ref name="Bandim, 2015"&gt;{{cite web|title=Background|url=http://bandim.org/about-bhp/background.aspx|website=Bandim Health Project|publisher=SSI|accessdate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, Peter Aaby was awarded the [[Novo Nordisk]] Prize, the most important Danish award within [[Outline of health sciences|health research]].

Aaby is credited for the discovery of [[non-specific effect of vaccines|non-specific effects of vaccines]] – i.e. effects of [[vaccine]]s, which go beyond the specific protective effects against the targeted diseases.&lt;ref name="Prentice, 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prentice|first1=AM|last2=Savy|first2=M|last3=Darboe|first3=MK|last4=Moore|first4=SE|title=Commentary: Challenging public health orthodoxies--prophesy or heresy?|journal=International Journal of Epidemiology|date=April 2009|volume=38|issue=2|pages=591–3|pmid=19174540|url=http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/38/2/591.short|doi=10.1093/ije/dyn363|pmc=2663722}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of non-specific effects of vaccines was established in 1991 and later documented in several trials on [[measles vaccine]], [[BCG vaccine|BCG]], [[oral polio vaccine]], [[DTP vaccine]] and [[smallpox vaccine]].&lt;ref name="Benn, 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Benn|first1=CS|last2=Netea|first2=MG|last3=Selin|first3=LK|last4=Aaby|first4=P|title=A small jab - a big effect: nonspecific immunomodulation by vaccines.|journal=Trends in Immunology|date=September 2013|volume=34|issue=9|pages=431–9|pmid=23680130|doi=10.1016/j.it.2013.04.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence of Aaby’s work on non-specific effects of vaccines it has been recommended the WHO [[vaccination program]] in [[low income countries]] should be changed.&lt;ref name="Shann, 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shann|first1=F|title=Nonspecific effects of vaccines and the reduction of mortality in children.|journal=Clinical Therapeutics|date=February 2013|volume=35|issue=2|pages=109–14|pmid=23375475|doi=10.1016/j.clinthera.2013.01.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[WHO]] recently reviewed the evidence for non-specific effects of BCG vaccine, measles vaccine and DTP vaccine, and concluded that it would "keep a watch on the evidence of nonspecific effects of vaccination".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Meeting of Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety, 18-19 June 2008|pmid=18689006 | volume=83 |issue=32 | date=Aug 2008|journal=Wkly Epidemiol Rec|pages=287–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Plastination''' is a technique or process used in [[anatomy]] to preserve bodies or body parts, first developed by [[Gunther von Hagens]] in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bodyworlds.com/en/plastination/idea_plastination.html |title=The Idea behind plastination |publisher=Institute for Plastination |accessdate=1 May 2012 |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The water and [[fat]] are replaced by certain [[plastic]]s, yielding specimens that can be touched, do not smell or [[bacterial decay|decay]], and even retain most properties of the original sample.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=A. H. |last=Weiglein |title=Overview &amp; General Principles of the Plastination Procedures |journal=8th Interim Conf Plast |year=2005 |url=http://www.uqtr.uquebec.ca/plastination/Abstracts-2005.html#Weiglein-01-2005 |accessdate=27 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
[[File:PlastinationProcess EN.svg|thumb|The centerpiece of plastination: "forced impregnation"]]

Four steps are used in the standard process of plastination: fixation, [[dehydration]], forced impregnation in a [[vacuum]], and hardening.&lt;ref name=hagans1987&gt;{{cite journal |first=Gunther |last=von Hagens |authorlink=Gunther von Hagens |author2=Klaus Tiedemann |author3=Wilhelm Kriz |title=The current potential of plastination |journal=Anatomy and Embryology |volume=175 |issue=4 |pages=411–21 |year=1987 |pmid=3555158 |doi=10.1007/BF00309677 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Water and [[lipid]] tissues are replaced by curable polymers, which include [[silicone]], [[epoxy]], and [[polyester]]-[[copolymer]].&lt;ref name=hagans1987/&gt;

The first step of plastination, fixation,&lt;ref name=henry1997&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert W. |last=Henry |author2=Larry Janick |author3=Francis Paul Salmos |date=February 1997 |title=Specimen preparation for silicone plastination |journal=Journal of the International Society for Plastination |issn=1090-2171 |url=https://www.uqtr.ca/plast-journal/vol12/1_Henry_13a17.pdf |volume=12 |issue=1 |accessdate=27 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  frequently uses a [[formaldehyde]]-based solution, and serves two functions. Dissecting the specimen to show specific anatomical elements can be time consuming. Formaldehyde or other preserving solutions help prevent [[decomposition]] of the tissues. They may also confer a degree of rigidity. This can be beneficial in maintaining the shape or arrangement of a specimen. A stomach might be inflated or a leg bent at the knee, for example.

After any necessary [[dissection]]s have taken place, the specimen is placed in a bath of [[acetone]] (freezing point −95°&amp;nbsp;C) at −20° to −30°&amp;nbsp;C. The volume of the bath should be 10 times that of the specimen. The acetone is renewed two times over the course of six weeks. The acetone draws out all the water and replaces it inside the [[Cell (biology)|cells]].&lt;ref name=bickley1987&gt;{{cite journal |first=Harmon C. |last=Bickley |author2=Robert S. Conner, Anna N. Walker and R. Lamar Jackson |date=January 1987 |title=Preservation of tissue by silicone rubber impregnation |url=http://journal.plastination.org/archive/jp_vol.01.1/jp_vol.01.1_030-039.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150624022306/http://journal.plastination.org/archive/jp_vol.01.1/jp_vol.01.1_030-039.pdf |archivedate=2015-06-24|dead-url=no |journal=Journal of the International Society for Plastination |issn=1090-2171 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=30–39 |accessdate=10 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the third step, the specimen is then placed in a bath of liquid polymer, such as [[silicone rubber]], [[polyester]], or [[epoxy resin]]. By creating a [[vacuum]], the acetone is made to boil at a low temperature. As the acetone [[vaporization|vaporizes]] and leaves the cells, it draws the liquid polymer in behind it, leaving a cell filled with liquid plastic.&lt;ref name=bickley1987/&gt;

The plastic must then be cured with gas, heat, or [[ultraviolet light]],  to harden it.&lt;ref name=henry1997/&gt;

A specimen can vary from a full [[human body]] to a small piece of an animal organ, and they are known as 'plastinates'.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Once plastinated, the specimens and bodies are further manipulated and positioned prior to curing (hardening) of the polymer chains.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

==History==
In November 1979, [[Gunther von Hagens]] applied for a German patent, proposing the idea of preserving animal and vegetable tissues permanently by synthetic resin impregnation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Ref patent |country=DE |number=2710147 |status=patent |title=Präparat aus biologischen verweslichen Objekten und Verfahren zu ihrer Herstellung |gdate=14 September 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, von Hagens has applied for further US patents regarding work on preserving biological tissues with polymers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Ref patent |country=US |number=4205059 |status=patent |title=Animal and vegetal tissues permanently preserved by synthetic resin  |gdate=27 May 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Ref patent |country=US |number=4320157 |status=patent |title=Method for preserving large sections of biological tissue with polymers  |gdate=16 March 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the success of his patents, von Hagens went on to form the Institute for Plastination in Heidelberg, Germany in 1993.  The Institute for Plastination, along with von Hagens, made their first showing of plastinated bodies in Japan in 1995, which drew more than three million visitors. The institute maintains three international centres of plastination, in Germany, Kyrgyzstan, and China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biodurproducts.com/en/plastination/preservation_plastination.html |title=Preservation by Plastination |publisher=BIODUR |accessdate=5 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related preservation methods==
Other methods have been in place for thousands of years to halt the decomposition of the body. [[Mummy|Mummification]] used by the [[ancient Egypt]]ians is a widely-known method which involves the removal of body fluid and wrapping the body in linens. Prior to mummification, Egyptians would lay the body in a shallow pit in the desert and allow the sun to dehydrate the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Eric |last=Rymer |url=http://historylink101.net/egypt_1/religion_mummification_history.htm |title=History of Burial Beliefs in Ancient Egypt |publisher=History Link 101 |accessdate=11 May 2009}}{{Unreliable source?|date=May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Formalin]], an important solution to body preservation, was introduced in 1896 to help with body preservation. Soon to follow formalin, color-preserving embalming solutions were developed to preserve life-like color and flexibility to aid in the study of the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.funeralmuseum.org/pdf/formaldehyde.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050306094856/http://www.funeralmuseum.org/pdf/formaldehyde.pdf |archivedate=6 March 2005 |title=Formaldehyde: Its Development And History Since 1868 |publisher=[[Museum of Funeral Customs]] |accessdate=11 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paraffin wax|Paraffin]] impregnation was introduced in 1925, and the embedding of organs in plastic was developed in the 1960s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Body preservation methods current to the 21st century are [[cryopreservation]], which involves the cooling of the body to very low temperatures to preserve the body tissues, plastination, and [[embalming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Ref patent |country=US |number=5089288 |status=patent |title=Method for Impregnating Tissue Samples in Paraffin |gdate=18 February 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other methods used in modern times include the Silicone S 10 Standard Procedure, the Cor-Tech Room temperature procedure, the Epoxy E 12 procedure, and the Polyester P 35 (P 40) procedure.&lt;ref name=Other&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meduni02.edis.at/plast/plmeth.html |title=Other Plastination Methods |publisher=International Society for Plastination |accessdate=19 May 2009 |date=20 October 1998 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515122825/http://meduni02.edis.at/plast/plmeth.html |archivedate=15 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Silicone S 10 is the procedure most often used in plastination and creates opaque, natural-looking specimen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://isp.plastination.org/silicone.html |title=The Silicone S 10 |publisher=International Society for Plastination |accessdate=19 May 2009 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dow Corning Corporation]]'s Cor-Tech Room Temperature Procedure is designed to allow plastination of specimen at [[room temperature]] to various degrees of flexibility using three combinations of polymer, [[crosslinker]], and [[catalyst]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://isp.plastination.org/cortech.html |title=The COR-TECH Room Temperature |publisher=International Society for Plastination |accessdate=19 May 2009 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the International Society for Plastination, the Epoxy E 12 procedure is used "for thin, transparent, and firm body and organ slices", while the Polyster P 35 (P 40) preserves "semitransparent and firm brain slices".&lt;ref name=Other/&gt; Samples are prepared for fixation through the first method by deep freezing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://isp.plastination.org/epoxy.html |title=The Epoxy E 12 |publisher=International Society for Plastination |accessdate=19 May 2009 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the second method works best following 4–6 weeks of preparation in a formaldehyde mixture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://isp.plastination.org/polyester.html |title=The Polyester P35/P40 |publisher=International Society for Plastination |accessdate=19 May 2009 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses of plastinated specimens==
Plastination is useful in anatomy, serving as models and teaching tools.&lt;ref name=nexusfall2004&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nyu.edu/dental/nexus/issues/fall2004/vonhagens.html |title=Life, Death, and One Man's Quest to Demystify the Inner Realms of the Human Body |journal=Nexus |date=Fall 2004 |accessdate=13 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used at more than 40 [[medical school|medical]] and [[dental school]]s throughout the world as an adjunct to anatomical dissection.
[[File:Histological section of bovine tongue.jpg|thumb|Histological section of bovine tongue, epoxy technique]]
Students enrolled in introductory [[animal science]] courses at many universities learn animal science through collections of multispecies large-animal specimens. Plastination allows students to have hands-on experience in this field, without exposure to chemicals such as formalin. For example, plastinated [[dog|canine]] [[gastrointestinal]] tracts are used to help in the teaching of [[endoscopy|endoscopic]] technique and anatomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=L. |last=Janick |author2=R. C. DeNovo |author3=R. W. Henry |year=1997 |title=Plastinated Canine Gastrointestinal Tracts Used to Facilitate Teaching of Endoscopic Technique and Anatomy |journal=Cells Tissues Organs |volume=158 |page=48 |doi=10.1159/000147910}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plastinated specimens retain their dilated conformation by a [[positive pressure]] air flow during the curing process, which allows them to be used to teach both endoscopic technique and gastrointestinal anatomy.

With the use of plastination as a teaching method of animal science, fewer animals have to be [[animal research|killed for research]], as the plastination process allows specimens to be studied for a long time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vet.ksu.edu/depts/ap/tour/labs/plastination.htm |title=KSUCVM Plastination Laboratory |publisher=Vet.ksu.edu |date=8 January 2009 |accessdate=2010-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[North Carolina State University]]'s College of Veterinary Medicine in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], uses both plastic coating (PC) and plastination (PN) to investigate and compare the difference in the two methods. The PC method was simple and inexpensive, but the PN specimens were more flexible, durable, and life-like than those preserved by the PC method. The use of plastination allowed the use of many body parts such as muscle, nerves, bones, [[ligaments]], and [[central nervous system]] to be preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Holladay SD, Hudson LC |title=Use of plastinated brains in teaching neuroanatomy at the North Carolina State University, College of Veterinary Medicine |journal=Journal of the International Society for Plastination |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=15–17 |year=1989 |url=https://www.uqtr.ca/plast-journal/vol3/Holladay_15a17.pdf |accessdate=19 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio]] was the first school in the United States to use this technique to prepare gross organ specimens for use in teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pathology.uthscsa.edu/parc/index.shtml |title=Pathology Academic Resource Center: UT Health Science Center - Graduate School of Biomedical Science |publisher=pathology.uthscsa.edu |accessdate=2010-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New York University College of Dentistry]].,&lt;ref name=nexusfall2004/&gt; [[Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.welcometopcom.com/tours/phl-anatomy.php |title=Virtual Campus Tour: PCOM Anatomy Lab |publisher=PCOM.edu |accessdate=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[University of Warwick]], and University of Northumbria &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.european-hospital.com/topics/article/4657.html |title=First University to Acquire von Hagens Plastinations for University Teaching |publisher=European-hospital.com |date=28 October 2008 |accessdate=2010-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; use collections of plastinates as teaching aids. The [[University of Vienna]] has its own plastination laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meduniwien.ac.at/plastination/ |title=Vienna University Plastination Facility |publisher=Meduniwien.ac.at |accessdate=2010-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethical concerns==
Concern over consent of bodies being used in the plastination process has arisen. Over 20 years ago, von Hagens set up a [[body donation]] program in [[Germany]] and has signed over 9,000 donors into the plastinate program: 531 have already died. The program has reported an average of one body a day being released to the plastination process. About 90% of the donors registered are German.

==Plastination exhibitions==
For the first 20 years, plastination was used to preserve small specimens for medical study. In the early 1990s, the equipment was developed to make plastinating whole body specimens possible, each specimen taking up to 1,500 man-hours to prepare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/leonardopodcast/TheLeonardoPodcast1.mp3 |title=TheLeonardo Podcast no. 1 |format=[[MP3]] |date=19 September 2008 |first=Ross |last=Chambless |accessdate=8 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first exhibition of whole bodies was displayed by von Hagens in Japan in 1995.

Over the next two years, Von Hagens developed the ''Körperwelten'' ([[Body Worlds]]) public exhibitions, showing whole bodies plastinated in life-like poses and dissected to show various structures and systems of human anatomy. The earliest exhibitions were presented in the [[Far East]] and in Germany, and Gunther von Hagens'  exhibitions have subsequently been hosted by museums and venues in more than 50 cities worldwide, attracting more than 29 million visitors.{{Citation needed|reason=a specific page with this specific information needs to be cited, not just the main body worlds website|date=May 2009}}.

Gunther von Hagens' Body Worlds exhibitions are the original, precedent-setting public anatomical exhibitions of real human bodies, and the only anatomical exhibits that use donated bodies, willed by donors to the Institute for Plastination for the express purpose of serving the Body Worlds mission to educate the public about health and anatomy. To date, more than 10,000 people have agreed to donate their bodies to Institute for Plastination.&lt;ref name="bodyworlds1"/&gt;

In 2004, [[Premier Exhibitions]] began their "Bodies Revealed" exhibition in [[Blackpool, England]], which ran from August through October 2004.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} In 2005 and 2006, the company opened their "Bodies Revealed" and "Bodies...The Exhibition" in [[Seoul]], [[Tampa]], and [[New York City]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} The West Coast exhibition site opened on 22 June 2006 at the Tropicana Resort and Casino Las Vegas.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} {{As of|2009|06}}, [[BODIES...

Plastination galleries are offered in a few college medical schools, including [[University of Michigan]] (said to be the nation's largest such lab)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.med.umich.edu/anatomy/plastinate/index.html |title=Plastination |publisher=Med.umich.edu |accessdate=2010-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Vienna University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meduniwien.ac.at/plastination/ |title=Plastination at the Vienna University |publisher=Meduniwien.ac.at |accessdate=2010-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Religion of Humanity''' (from French ''Religion de l'Humanité'' or ''[[w:fr:église positiviste|église positiviste]]'') is a [[secular religion]] created by [[Auguste Comte]], the founder of [[Positivism|positivist]] philosophy. Adherents of this religion have built chapels of Humanity in [[France]] and [[Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url = http://membres.lycos.fr/clotilde/temple.htm
|title = Où peut-on visiter un temple positiviste ? (Where Are Positivist Shrines to be Seen?)
|accessdate = 2007-10-30
|language = French
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States and Europe, Comte's ideas influenced others, and contributed to the emergence of [[ethical movement|ethical societies]] and "ethical churches", which led to the development of Ethical culture, [[religious humanism|congregational humanist]], and [[secular humanism|secular humanist]] organisations.

==Origins==
Comte developed the ''religion of humanity'' for positivist societies in order to fulfill the cohesive function once held by traditional worship. The religion was developed after Comte's passionate platonic relationship with [[Clotilde de Vaux]], whom he idealised after her death. He became convinced that feminine values embodied the triumph of sentiment and morality. In a future science-based Positivist society there should also be a religion that would have power by virtue of moral force alone.&lt;ref name = "soci"&gt;Rollin Chambliss, ''Social Thought: From Hammurabi to Comte'', Dryden Press, New York, 1954, p.424.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1849, he proposed a [[calendar reform]] called the "[[positivist calendar]]", in which months were named after history's greatest leaders, thinkers, and artists, and arranged in chronological order. Each day was dedicated to a thinker.

==Tenets==
According to Tony Davies, Comte's secular and positive religion was "a complete system of belief and ritual, with liturgy and sacraments, priesthood and pontiff, all organized around the public veneration of Humanity", referred to as the ''Nouveau Grand-Être Suprême'' (New Supreme Great Being). "This was later to be supplemented in a positivist trinity by the ''Grand Fétish'' (the Earth) and the ''Grand Milieu'' (Cosmic Space)".&lt;ref name = "dave"&gt;Davies, Tony. ''Humanism'', The New Critical Idiom. Drakakis, John, series editor. University of Stirling, UK. Routledge, 1997, p.28-29 {{ISBN|0-415-11052-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In ''Système de politique positive'' (1851–1854) Comte stated that the pillars of the religion are: 
*'''altruism''', leading to generosity and selfless dedication to others.
*'''order''': Comte thought that after the [[French Revolution]], society needed restoration of order.
*'''progress''': the consequences of industrial and technical breakthroughs for human societies.

In ''Catéchisme positiviste'' (1851), Comte defined the Church of Humanity's seven [[sacrament]]s:
*'''Introduction'''; (nomination and sponsoring)
*'''Admission'''; (end of education)
*'''Destination'''; (choice of a career)
*'''Marriage''';
*'''Retirement'''; (age 63),
*'''Separation'''; (social extreme unction),
*'''Incorporation'''; (absorption into history) - 3 years after death.

==Liturgy and priesthood==
[[File:Templo Positivista em Porto Alegre - Posse de Erlon Jacques de Oliveira 02.JPG|thumb|Erlon Jacques de Oliveira, Temple guardian in Porto Alegre|upright=1.2]]
The Religion of Humanity was described by [[Thomas Huxley]] as "Catholicism minus Christianity".&lt;ref name = "soci"/&gt; In addition to a holy trinity of Humanity, the Earth and Destiny, it had a priesthood. Priests were ''required'' to be married, because of the ennobling influence of womanhood. They would conduct services, including Positivist prayer, which was "a solemn out-pouring, whether in private or in public, of men's nobler feelings, inspiring them with larger and more comprehensive thoughts." The purpose of the religion was to increase altruism, so that believers acted always in the best interests of humanity as a whole. The priests would be international ambassadors of altruism, teaching, arbitrating in industrial and political disputes, and directing public opinion. They should be scholars, physicians, poets and artists. Indeed all the arts, including dancing and singing should be practiced by them, like [[bard]]s in ancient societies.  

This required long training. They began training from the age of twenty-eight, studying in positivist schools. From thirty-five to forty-two a priest served in an apprentice position as teacher and ritualist. Only at the age of forty-two could he become a full priest. They earned no money and could not hold offices outside the priesthood. In this way their influence was purely spiritual and moral. The High Priest of Humanity was to live in Paris, which would replace Rome as the centre of religion.&lt;ref name = "soci"/&gt;

==Influence==
Davies argues that Comte's austere and "slightly dispiriting" philosophy of humanity - viewed as alone in an indifferent universe (which can only be explained by "positive" science) - "was even more influential in Victorian England than the theories of Charles Darwin or Karl Marx".&lt;ref name = "dave"/&gt;

The ''system'' was ultimately unsuccessful but, along with [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', it influenced the proliferation of various [[Secular Humanist]] organizations in the 19th century, especially through the work of secularists such as [[George Holyoake]] and [[Richard Congreve]]. Although Comte's English followers, including [[George Eliot]] and [[Harriet Martineau]], for the most part rejected the full panoply of his system, they liked the idea of a religion of humanity and his injunction to "vivre pour altrui" ("live for others", from which comes the word "[[altruism]]").

Profound criticism came from [[John Stuart Mill]] who advocated Comte but dismissed his Religion of Humanity in a move towards a differentiation between the (good) early Comte, the author of ''[[The Course in Positive Philosophy]]'' and the (problematic) late Comte, who authored the Religion of Humanity.&lt;ref&gt;See the central passage of Mill's ''Auguste Comte and Positivism'': John Stuart Mill on Auguste Comte’s Religion of Humanity ([http://positivists.org/blog/archives/3719])&lt;/ref&gt; While sympathising with the need for a [[secular religion]], and appreciating Comte’s respect for “the Human Race, conceived as a continuous whole, including the past, he present and the future”, Mill thought that the details of Comte’s ritualism were not only illiberal but “could have been written by no man who had ever laughed”.&lt;ref&gt;Mill, in A Ryan, ‘’J S Mill’’ (London 1974) p. 234-5&lt;/ref&gt;
 
=== Religion of Humanity in Brazil===
Comtean Positivism was relatively popular in Brazil. In 1881 Miguel Lemos and [[Raimundo Teixeira Mendes]] organized the "Positivist Church of Brazil." In 1897 the "Temple of Humanity" was created.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=b3BA1k09JHUC&amp;pg=PA184&amp;lpg=PA184&amp;dq=%22religion+of+humanity%22+brazil&amp;source=web&amp;ots=08euTo6046&amp;sig=PmQR3toJCZX2aCaXe8oUv7D5lvs&amp;hl=en Latin American Thought: Philosophical Problems and Arguments By Susana Nuccetelli: Page 184]&lt;/ref&gt; The services at the Temple could go on for up to four hours and that, combined with a certain moral strictness, led to some decline during the Republican period.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SltigewTmMwC&amp;pg=PA113&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;dq=%22temple+of+humanity%22+brazil&amp;source=web&amp;ots=eWbqnsEKzY&amp;sig=H6m000aZeQIU8j6YvezXlN5ejbQ&amp;hl=en#PPA113,M1 The Human Tradition in Modern Brazil By Peter M. Beattie: Pages 112-113]&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless it had appeal with the military class as [[Benjamin Constant (Brazil)|Benjamin Constant]] joined the group before breaking with it because he deemed Mendes and Lemos as too fanatical. [[Cândido Rondon]]'s conversion proved more solid as he remained an orthodox Positivist and a member of the faith long after the church's importance waned.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vDHZJ433ficC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;lpg=PA83&amp;dq=%22positivist+church%22+brazil&amp;source=web&amp;ots=hQ8nhytmgT&amp;sig=v_-4WrrWtbHDmHF1tmoDnd1xNj0&amp;hl=en#PPA84,M1 Stringing Together a Nation: Candido Mariano da Silva Rondon and the... By Todd A. Diacon: pgs 83-84]&lt;/ref&gt; Although declined, the church still survives in Brazil. The national [[flag of Brazil]] bears the "Ordem e Progresso" ("Order and Progress"), inspired by Comte's motto of positivism: "L’amour pour principe et l’ordre pour base; le progrès pour but" ("Love as a principle and order as the basis; progress as the goal").&lt;ref name="historianet"&gt;[http://www.historianet.com.br/conteudo/default.aspx?codigo=934 Bandeiras e significados] Historianet.

== Other examples ==
There are more examples of Religion of Humanity started by positivists, and there are several authors who have given the epithet to the religion they support, whatever the religion. In India [[Baba Faqir Chand]] established [[Manavta Mandir]] (Temple of Humanity) to spread his religion of humanity with scientific attitude as explained by [[David C. Lane]] in a book ''The Unknowing Sage''. Comte influenced the thought of Victorian secularists [[George Holyoake]] (coiner of the term "[[secularism]]") and [[Richard Congreve]].

A '''Santa Claus machine''', named after the folkloric [[Santa Claus]], is a hypothetical machine that is capable of creating any required object or structure out of any given material. It is most often referenced by [[Futures studies|futurist]]s and [[science fiction]] writers when discussing hypothetical projects of enormous scale, such as a [[Dyson sphere]]. These types of future constructions would be too large for many civilizations to build directly, so they would need a series of machines to intelligently build the machine with little or no direct control.

==Origin==
The term was coined by [[Ted Taylor (physicist)|Theodore Taylor]] in 1978:{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;It's possible to imagine a machine that could scoop up material – rocks from the Moon or rocks from asteroids – process them inside and produce just about any product: washing machines or teacups or automobiles or starships. Once such a machine exists it could gather sunlight and materials that it's sitting on, and produce on call whatever product anybody wants to name, as long as somebody knows how to make it and those instructions can be given to the machine. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Discussion==
A mature Santa Claus machine requires significant advances in technology to be possible, including the ability to take any collection of matter and reconfigure it into any other type of matter.

Scientifically, it requires two parts: a disassembler and an assembler.

One form of disassembler would consist of an ionizing chamber, which heats the input matter to 43,000&amp;nbsp;°F (24,000&amp;nbsp;°C).{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}  Once all the molecular bonds are broken and the electrons ripped off, each atomic nucleus would be moved through a magnetic field, where its path would curve in proportion to its charge/mass ratio, as per [[mass spectrometry]]. The separated ions would be captured by a linear array of cold traps to provide reservoirs of each element.

The assembler would use these reservoirs as input to some kind of [[3D printing|additive layer manufacturing]] device (also known as 3D printers and rapid prototype machines).  Many of these printers are commercially available today—though currently few can print with more than one highly prepared material (much less an alphabet consisting of all the raw elements).

An autonomous Santa Claus machine would presumably require a high level of [[artificial intelligence]], though for small projects, autonomous behavior is probably not necessary.  However, the "matter compiler" (that figures out which atom goes where) must be programmed appropriately—not a trivial task. A gigantic project such as a [[Dyson sphere]] would undoubtedly require not only autonomy, but also self-replication.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} These capabilities would enable a single Santa Claus machine, given sufficient matter and energy, to construct a project of any size.

Many theorists{{Who|date=August 2012}} have seen the obvious nightmare scenarios that accompany such a device, including machines running out of control and destroying an entire planet, or a [[clanking replicator]] disaster, ''à la'' the brooms in ''[[The Sorcerer's Apprentice]]''. At the other extreme, others{{Who|date=August 2012}} suppose the resultant [[post scarcity]] [[economy]] could lead to a near-[[utopia]]—''[[Star Trek]]'' being the most culturally prominent example of this possibility.

The human society seen as a whole can be thought of as a limited Santa Claus machine.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

It may be considered [[synonym]]ous with [[adulthood]],&lt;ref name="McNamara"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Edward McNamara| title =Evolution, Culture, and Consciousness: The Discovery of the Preconscious Mind| isbn = 076182765X | publisher = [[University Press of America]] | year = 2004 | page = 262-263|accessdate=March 20, 2018|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BeLmG7HP_U0C&amp;pg=PA262}}&lt;/ref&gt; but, in humans, [[puberty]] encompasses the process of sexual maturation and adulthood is based on cultural definitions.&lt;ref name="McNamara"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanfilippo"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Joseph S.

This differentiation prompts the practitioner to consider the psychological, behavioral, and social changes of the adolescent who is experiencing pubertal development.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most [[multicellular]] organisms are unable to [[sexually reproduce]] at birth (or germination), and depending on the species, it may be days, weeks, or years until their bodies are able to do so. Also, certain cues may cause the organism to become sexually mature. They may be external, such as drought, or internal, such as percentage of body fat (such internal cues are not to be confused with hormones which directly produce sexual maturity).

Sexual maturity is brought about by a maturing of the reproductive organs and the production of [[gamete]]s. It may also be accompanied by a growth spurt or other physical changes which distinguish the immature organism from its adult form. These are termed [[secondary sex characteristic]]s, and often represent an increase in [[sexual dimorphism]]. For example, before puberty, human children have flat chests, but adult females have generally larger [[breast]]s than adult males. However, there are exceptions such as obesity and hormone imbalances such as [[gynecomastia]].

After sexual maturity is achieved, it is possible for some organisms to become [[infertile]], or even to [[Sex change|change their sex]]. Some organisms are [[hermaphrodite]]s and may or may not be able to produce viable offspring. Also, while in many organisms sexual maturity is strongly linked to age, many other factors are involved, and it is possible for some to display most or all of the characteristics of the adult form without being sexually mature. Conversely it is also possible for the "immature" form of an organism to reproduce. This is called ''progenesis'', in which sexual development occurs faster than other physiological development (in contrast, the term ''[[neoteny]]'' refers to when non-sexual development is slowed - but the result is the same, the retention of juvenile characteristics into adulthood).

The '''Treens''' are fictional aliens in the [[Dan Dare]] stories. They first appeared in ''[[Dan Dare: The First Story]]'', which was serialized in [[Eagle (comic)|the ''Eagle'']] comic magazine from Volume 1, Number 1 (April 14, 1950) to Volume 2, Number 25 (September 28, 1951). The story was drawn by [[Frank Hampson]].

==Fictional background==
The Treens are a race of green-skinned [[humanoid]]s from the northern hemisphere of the planet [[Venus]]. The southern hemisphere is inhabited by the Therons, a human-like race with an obvious affinity to humanity on Earth. The Treens share the northern hemisphere with the  ''Atlantines'', a blue-skinned people whose ancestors came from Earth 100,000 years previously. The two hemispheres are separated by the "flamelands" around the equator which are impassable, except by specially equipped aircraft.

The leader of the Treens is [[the Mekon]], an individual specifically engineered to have a high intelligence. The Treens are portrayed as mostly unemotional without the usual human feelings about the sanctity of life. In ancient times, they lived as savage jungle tribes permanently involved in tribal wars amongst themselves, until in a major war the Therons occupied the northern hemisphere by force in an attempt to civilize the Treens. The attempt failed and the Therons later abandoned the Treens to their own devices.

Soon after, Treen scientists created the first ''Mekon'' as a "super-brain" to rule over the Treen race. The Mekon developed Treen society into a highly organized militaristic logic-based society where orders are obeyed without query, and which is usually in a state of hostility with the Therons and Earth, both of whose lands they have on occasion occupied. Their [[capital city]] is called [[Mekonta]] and is on islands in a lake. The Atlantines are usually ignored by the Treens, and live in primitive conditions.
	 
'''Mekonta''' is the capital city of the Treens in the [[Dan Dare]] stories. It is named after [[The Mekon]]. It is built on many islands in a lake. Its design may have been inspired by [[Venice]] and/or [[Tenochtitlan]]. It was ruined in the war in ''[[Dan Dare: The First Story]]'', and New Mekonta was built nearby. Afterwards for a long time Old Mekonta remained uncleared ruins.
	 
The Magnets of Mekonta are huge [[electromagnet]]s on mountaintops around Mekonta. They are used to raise and lower spaceships in and out of Mekonta.

==Political interpretation==
Creator Frank Hampson stated "Basically we were fighting the Second World War again – the Treens were the Nazis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Onward Christian Spacemen: Dan Dare - Pilot of the Future as British Cultural History | last=Chapman | first=James | journal=Visual Culture in Britain | volume=9 | number=1 | date=June 2008 | pages=55–79 | publisher=[[Manchester University Press]] | url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/manup/vcb/2008/00000009/00000001/art00003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2302">'''Tri Hita Karana''' is a traditional philosophy for life on the island of [[Bali]], [[Indonesia]]. The literal translation is roughly the "three causes of well-being" or "three reasons for prosperity."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Fox, [https://books.google.com/books?id=eKqvEZc8y3MC&amp;pg=PA118 Critical Reflections on Religion and Media in Contemporary Bali], Brill, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The three causes referred to in the principle are:
# Harmony among people
# Harmony with nature or environment
# Harmony with God

It is derived from the [[Balinese Hinduism|Balinese spiritualism and beliefs]], which promotes harmony among fellow human beings through communal cooperation and promoting compassion; harmony towards God, manifested in numerous rituals and offerings to appease deities; and harmony with their environment, which strife to conserve the nature and promote the sustainability and balance of the environment. Tri Hita Karana is credited for the island's prosperity as a whole, its relatively stable record of development, environmental practices, and the overall quality of life for its residents.&lt;ref&gt;Anand Krishna, Tri Hita Karana: Ancient Balinese Wisdom for Neo Humans, Anand Ashram Foundation, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle of Tri Hita Karana guides many aspects of Balinese life, from daily rituals, communal ''gotong-royong'' cooperation practice, to spatial organization in [[Balinese architecture]]. It is also reflected in the natural irrigation system on the island known as [[subak]], which consists of cooperatively managed [[weirs]] and [[canals]] that draw from a single water source.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO, [http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1194 Cultural Landscape of Bali Province: the Subak System as a Manifestation of the Tri Hita Karana Philosophy].&lt;/ref&gt; Former President of Indonesia, [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]], even invoked it in his address to the International Conference on Sustainable Development during APEC 2013, which was held in Bali.&lt;ref&gt;Global Travel Industry News, [http://www.eturbonews.com/38679/bali-s-tri-hita-karana-life-philosophy-recommended-apec-sustaina Bali’s Tri Hita Karana life philosophy recommended for APEC Sustainable Economic Development], 9 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''weasel program''' or '''Dawkins' weasel''' is a [[thought experiment]] and a variety of [[computer simulation]]s illustrating it.  Their aim is to demonstrate that the process that drives [[evolution]]ary systems—random [[Mutation|variation]] combined with non-random cumulative [[Selection (biology)|selection]]—is different from pure [[chance (philosophy)|chance]].

The thought experiment was formulated by [[Richard Dawkins]], and the first simulation written by him; various other implementations of the program have been written by others.

== Overview ==
In chapter 3 of his book ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'', Dawkins gave the following introduction to the program, referencing the well-known [[infinite monkey theorem]]:

{{quote|I don't know who it was first pointed out that, given enough time, a [[monkey]] bashing away at [[Randomness|random]] on a [[typewriter]] could produce all the works of [[Shakespeare]]. The operative phrase is, of course, given enough time. Let us limit the task facing our monkey somewhat. Suppose that he has to produce, not the complete works of Shakespeare but just the short sentence 'Methinks it is like a [[weasel]]', and we shall make it relatively easy by giving him a typewriter with a restricted keyboard, one with just the 26 (capital) letters, and a space bar. How long will he take to write this one little sentence?}}

The scenario is staged to produce a string of [[gibberish]] letters, assuming that the selection of each letter in a sequence of 28 characters will be random. The number of possible combinations in this random sequence is 27&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;, or about 10&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;, so the [[probability]] that the monkey will produce a given sequence is extremely low. Any particular sequence of 28 characters could be selected as a "target" phrase, all equally as improbable as Dawkins's chosen target, "METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL".

A [[computer program]] could be written to carry out the actions of Dawkins's [[Hypothesis|hypothetical]] monkey, continuously generating combinations of 26 letters and spaces at high speed. Even at the rate of millions of combinations per second, it is unlikely, even given the entire [[Age of the universe|lifetime of the universe]] to run, that the program would ever produce the phrase "METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL".&lt;ref&gt;For a string of 28 characters, with 27 possible characters (A-Z plus space), any randomly generated string has the probability one in 27^28 of being correct; that is approximately one in 10^40. If a program generating 10 million strings per second had been running since the start of the universe (around 14 billion years, or 10^17 seconds), it would have only generated around 10^24 strings by now.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dawkins intends this example to illustrate a common misunderstanding of [[evolution]]ary change, i.e. that [[DNA]] sequences or [[organic compound]]s such as [[proteins]] are the result of atoms randomly combining to form more complex structures. In these types of computations, any sequence of [[amino acids]] in a protein will be extraordinarily improbable (this is known as [[Hoyle's fallacy]]). Rather, evolution proceeds by [[hill climbing]], as in [[adaptive landscape]]s.

Dawkins then goes on to show that a process of ''cumulative'' selection can take far fewer steps to reach any given target. In Dawkins's words:

{{quote|We again use our computer monkey, but with a crucial difference in its program. It again begins by choosing a random sequence of 28 letters, just as before ... it duplicates it repeatedly, but with a certain chance of random [[error]] &amp;ndash; 'mutation' &amp;ndash; in the copying. The computer examines the [[mutant]] nonsense phrases, the 'progeny' of the original phrase, and chooses the one which,'' however slightly, ''most resembles the target phrase, METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL.}}

By repeating the procedure, a randomly generated sequence of 28 letters and spaces will be gradually changed each [[generation]]. The sequences progress through each generation:

:Generation&amp;nbsp;01:&lt;tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;WDLTMNLT&amp;nbsp;DTJBKWIRZREZLMQCO&amp;nbsp;P&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Note: the 4th character of line 1 is missing in Dawkins' text; however line 2 suggests it was probably a T&lt;/ref&gt;
:Generation&amp;nbsp;02:&lt;tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;WDLTMNLT&amp;nbsp;DTJBSWIRZREZLMQCO&amp;nbsp;P&lt;/tt&gt;
:Generation&amp;nbsp;10:&lt;tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;MDLDMNLS&amp;nbsp;ITJISWHRZREZ&amp;nbsp;MECS&amp;nbsp;P&lt;/tt&gt;
:Generation&amp;nbsp;20:&lt;tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;MELDINLS&amp;nbsp;IT&amp;nbsp;ISWPRKE&amp;nbsp;Z&amp;nbsp;WECSEL&lt;/tt&gt;
:Generation&amp;nbsp;30:&lt;tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;METHINGS&amp;nbsp;IT&amp;nbsp;ISWLIKE&amp;nbsp;B&amp;nbsp;WECSEL&lt;/tt&gt;
:Generation&amp;nbsp;40:&lt;tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;METHINKS&amp;nbsp;IT&amp;nbsp;IS&amp;nbsp;LIKE&amp;nbsp;I&amp;nbsp;WEASEL&lt;/tt&gt;
:Generation&amp;nbsp;43:&lt;tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;METHINKS&amp;nbsp;IT&amp;nbsp;IS&amp;nbsp;LIKE&amp;nbsp;A&amp;nbsp;WEASEL&lt;/tt&gt;

Dawkins continues:

{{quote|The exact time taken by the computer to reach the target doesn't matter. If you want to know, it completed the whole exercise for me, the first time, while I was out to lunch. It took about half an hour. (Computer enthusiasts may think this unduly slow. The reason is that the program was written in [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]], a sort of computer baby-talk. When I rewrote it in [[Pascal programming language|Pascal]], it took 11 seconds.) Computers are a bit faster at this kind of thing than monkeys, but the difference really isn't significant. What matters is the difference between the time taken by'' cumulative ''selection, and the time which the same computer, working flat out at the same rate, would take to reach the target phrase if it were forced to use the other procedure of'' single-step selection: ''about a million million million million million years. This is more than a million million million times as long as the universe has so far existed.}}

==Implications for biology==
The program aims to demonstrate that the preservation of small changes in an evolving string of characters (or [[gene]]s) can produce meaningful combinations in a relatively short time as long as there is some mechanism to select cumulative changes, whether it is a person identifying which traits are desirable (in the case of artificial selection) or a criterion of survival ("fitness") imposed by the environment (in the case of natural selection). Reproducing systems tend to preserve traits across generations, because the offspring inherit a copy of the parent's traits. It is the differences between offspring, the variations in copying, which become the basis for selection, allowing phrases closer to the target to survive, and the remaining variants to "die."

Dawkins discusses the issue of the mechanism of selection with respect to his "biomorphs" program:

{{quote|The human eye has an active role to play in the story. It is the selecting agent. It surveys the litter of progeny and chooses one for breeding. ...Our model, in other words, is strictly a model of artificial selection, not natural selection. The criterion for 'success' is not the direct criterion of survival, as it is in true natural selection. In true natural selection, if a body has what it takes to survive, its genes automatically survive because they are inside it. So the genes that survive tend to be, automatically, those genes that confer on bodies the qualities that assist them to survive.}}

Regarding the example's applicability to biological evolution, he is careful to point out that it has its limitations:

{{quote|Although the monkey/Shakespeare model is useful for explaining the distinction between single-step selection and cumulative selection, it is misleading in important ways. One of these is that, in each generation of selective 'breeding', the mutant 'progeny' phrases were judged according to the criterion of resemblance to a'' distant ideal ''target, the phrase METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL. Life isn't like that. Evolution has no long-term goal. There is no long-distance target, no final perfection to serve as a criterion for selection, although human vanity cherishes the absurd notion that our species is the final goal of evolution. In real life, the criterion for selection is always short-term, either simple survival or, more generally, reproductive success.}}

[[File:Dawkins-Weasel.png|thumb | A full run of a weasel program, with 100 offspring per generation, and a 5% mutation chance per character copied. Only the "fittest" string of each generation is shown. Note that, in generation 8, the 25th character, which had been correct (&lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;), becomes incorrect (&lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt;). The program does not "lock" correct characters, rather it measures at each iteration the closeness of the complete string to the 'target' phrase.]]

==More complex models==
In ''The Blind Watchmaker,'' Dawkins goes on to provide a graphical model of [[gene selection]] involving  entities he calls biomorphs. These are [[Plane (mathematics)|two-dimensional]] sets of [[Line (mathematics)#Line segment|line segments]] which bear relationships to each other, drawn under the control of "genes" that determine the appearance of the biomorph. By selecting entities from sequential generations of biomorphs, an experimenter can guide the evolution of the figures toward given shapes, such as "airplane" or "octopus" biomorphs.

As a simulation, the biomorphs are not much closer to the actual genetic behavior of biological organisms. Like the Weasel program, their development is shaped by an external factor, in this case the decisions of the experimenter who chooses which of many possible shapes will go forward into the following generation. They do however serve to illustrate the concept of "genetic space," where each possible gene is treated as a [[dimension]], and the actual genomes of living organisms make up a tiny fraction of all possible gene combinations, most of which will not produce a viable organism. As Dawkins puts it, "however many ways there may be of being alive, it is certain that there are vastly more ways of being dead". 

In ''Climbing Mount Improbable'', Dawkins responded to the limitations of the Weasel program by describing programs, written by other parties, that modeled the evolution of the [[spider web]].  He suggested that these programs were more realistic models of the evolutionary process, since they had no predetermined goal other than coming up with a web that caught more flies through a "trial and error" process.  Spiderwebs were seen as good topics for evolutionary modeling because they were simple examples of biosystems that were easily visualized; the modeling programs successfully generated a range of spider webs similar to those found in nature.

== Example algorithm ==
{{or section|date=August 2016}}
Although Dawkins did not provide the source code for his program, a "Weasel" style algorithm could run as follows.

# Start with a random string of 28 characters.
# Make 100 copies of the string (''reproduce'').
# For each character in each of the 100 copies, with a probability of 5%, replace (''mutate'') the character with a new random character.
#  Compare each new string with the target string "METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL", and give each a score (the number of letters in the string that are correct and in the correct position).
# If any of the new strings has a perfect score (28), halt. Otherwise, take the highest scoring string, and go to step 2.

For these purposes, a "character" is any uppercase letter, or a space. The number of copies per generation, and the chance of mutation per letter are not specified in Dawkins's book; 100 copies and a 5% mutation rate are examples. Correct letters are not "locked". Each correct letter may become incorrect in subsequent generations. The terms of the program and the existence of the target phrase do however mean that such 'negative mutations' will quickly be 'corrected'.
