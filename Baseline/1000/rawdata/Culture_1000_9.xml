"'''American-Born Confused Desi'''" ("'''ABCD'''") is a term used to refer to [[Indian Americans]] born or raised in the [[United States]], in contrast to those who were born overseas and later settled in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;Radhakrishnan, Rajagopalan, "Diaspora, Hybridity, Pedagogy", ''Peripheral Centres, Central Peripheries'' (ed. Ghosh-Schellhorn, Martina &amp; Alexander, Vera), page 116, LIT Verlag Berlin-Hamburg-Münster, 2006, {{ISBN|3-8258-9210-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neologism==
{{See also|Bangladeshi American|Indian American|Pakistani American}}
"ABCD" or "American-Born Confused [[Desi]]" has become a polarizing factor in the Indian and other South Asian diaspora in the US, with first-generation immigrant parents and young South Asians of second or later generations.&lt;ref&gt;Airriess, Christopher A., ''Contemporary Ethnic Geographies in America'', page 287, Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2007, {{ISBN|0-7425-3772-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the term was originally coined in reference to Indian-Americans, it has been adopted by the South Asian community at large. The term "[[desi]]" comes from the word "''des''" (homeland) in [[Hindi]].  The word has its origin in [[Sanskrit]] "desh". It's pronounced as "desh" in Bengali language (Bangla) too. "Desi" means "of the homeland" and denotes anything or anyone from South Asia. The term has been commonly known since at least the 1980s. The term "confused" is used to describe the psychological state of many second-generation South Asian Americans who struggle to balance values and traditions taught at home with attitudes and practices that are more conducive to the majority white culture.

The longer and lesser known form "American Born Confused [[Desi]], Emigrated From [[Gujarat]], House In [[New Jersey|Jersey]]" is also occasionally seen; playing on the alphabet theme, it has been expanded for K-Z variously as "Kids Learning Medicine, Now Owning Property, Quite Reasonable Salary, Two Uncles Visiting, White [[Xenophobia]], Yet Zestful" or "Keeping Lotsa Motels, Named Omkarnath Patel, Quickly Reaching Success Through Underhanded Vicious Ways, Xenophobic Yet Zestful".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Das|first=Diya|title=The Evolution of an Identity: Indian American Immigrants from the Early 20th Century to the Present|publisher=Tribute Books|year=2007|isbn=0-9795045-6-2|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former version of the A—Z expansion was proposed by South Asian immigrants as a reaction to the latter version that derogated them.&lt;ref&gt;Mitra Kalita, S., ''Suburban Sahibs'', page 13, Rutgers University Press, 2005, {{ISBN|0-8135-3665-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Confused Americanized Desi (CAD)" is a related term, which refers to people of South Asian origin who are both born and living in the subcontinent but tend to follow western lifestyle and values.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}
Coconuts is also a term used which basically refers to people who are "white from the inside and brown from the outside".

==Cultural implications==
Among [[Asian American|South Asian Americans]], the term may be considered divisive, as [[Immigrant generations|first generation]] South Asian Americans use it to criticize the [[Americanization (immigration)|Americanization]] and lack of belonging to either Indian Asian or American culture they perceive in their second-generation peers or children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|booktitle=Contemporary Ethnic Geographies in America|editors=Ines Miyares, Christopher A. Airriess|title=Asian Indians and the Construction of Community and Identity|publisher=Rowman and Littlefield|pages=287|last=Skop|first=Emily|isbn=0-7425-3772-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer [[Vijay Prashad]] describes the term as "ponderous and overused" and notes it as one of the mechanisms by which new immigrants attempt to make second-generation youth feel "culturally inadequate and unfinished.".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Karma of Brown Folk|last=Prashad|first=Vijay|page=131|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=2000|isbn=0-8166-3439-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Movies==
The term American-Born Confused Desi first appeared in the movie ''[[American Desi]]'' (2001).''[[ABCD: American-Born Confused Desi (film)|ABCD: American-Born Confused Desi]]'' is a 2013 [[Malayalam]] language movie released in India.The film narrates the journey of two young American Malayalees to their motherland, [[Kerala]], with the title based on the term "American-Born Confused Desi".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4359">'''''Antillanité''''' is a literary and political movement developed in the 1960s that stresses the creation of a specific [[West Indian]] identity out of a multiplicity of ethnic and cultural elements.

== Background ==
From the early 1960s, a new way of envisaging [[French West Indian]] identity began to be articulated by a number of [[Martinican]] thinkers, which, in contrast to [[Négritude]]'s stress on the retention of [[Africa]]n cultural forms in the [[Caribbean]], dwelt rather on the creation, out of a multiplicity of constituent elements, of a specifically West Indian cultural configuration to which, in time, the name "Antillanité" came to be given.

It seems to have been [[René Ménil]], a former collaborator of [[Aimé Césaire]], one of the principal champions of the Négritude movement, who, in an article entitled "Problèmes d'une culture antillaise" first clearly formulated the idea of a West Indian specificity (''spécificité antillaise'') that would enjoy such success in the years that followed. 

French West Indian culture, according to Ménil, is: "neither African nor [[Chinese people|Chinese]], nor [[India]]n, nor even [[French people|French]], but ultimately West Indian.  Our culture is West Indian since, in the course of history, it has brought together and combined in an original [[syncretism]] all these elements derived from the four corners of the earth, without being any one of those elements in particular."&lt;ref&gt;Burton, Richard. "KI MOUN NOU YE? The Idea of Difference in Contemporary French West Indian Thought." ''New West Indian Guide'' 67.1 and 2 (1993), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theoretical principles ==
Originally intended as a counter to the doctrine of Négritude, and its stress on an African rather than Caribbean identity, Antillanité was positively received by a number of prominent Martinican intellectuals, in particular the Groupe de Recherches de l'Institut Martiniquais d'Etudes headed by [[Édouard Glissant]], which published the results of its discussions on Caribbean identity in the short-lived journal ''[[Acoma (journal)|Acoma]]'' (1971–73).

Like its predecessor, Négritude, Antillanité is, at its base, an assertion of the difference in the face of the encroachments of the same.  The whole of Glissant's theoretical work may be seen as a sustained [[polemic]], conducted in the name of "le Divers," (the different) against the claims of the universal, to which a succession of derogatory epithets are attached in a more or less routine fashion.

For Glissant, "the preoccupation with the universal is the alienated reverse side of the uniquely western pretension to exercise universal control",&lt;ref&gt;Glissant, Edouard. ''Le discours antillais''. Paris: Editions de Seuil, 1981. p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; and it therefore follows that proponents of Antillanité must adopt a "firm opposition to any ideology of universal culture."&lt;ref&gt;Glissant, Edouard. ''Le discours antillais''. Paris: Editions de Seuil, 1981. p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt;  Where Antillanité differs most markedly from Négritude is in its conception of the constitution of the different.  For Négritude, the different was monolithic, being essentially African in character; however, in the view of Glissant, the different is, itself, diverse, complex, and heterogeneous, made up of a multiplicity of relations held in place by a complex process of attraction and repulsion.  Thus, it could be said that while Négritude looked inwards, to African heritage, for its models and values Antillanité looked both inwards, and outwards, towards the Caribbean and [[Meso-America]] as a whole, in its quest for self-invention from which proponents conceived identity as an archipelago of signifiers, none of which enjoys primacy over the others and whose unity lies not in the fact of possessing a single source but, rather, in the complex amalgamation of these myriad forces which hold themselves in relation to each other.  One of the major advances made by Antillanité is that it has, in large measure, shed the regressive, matrocentric orientation common to both assimilationism and Négritude.

'''Aptal Nisan''' is a Turkish [[wedding]] tradition dating back to the days of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The tradition in its most basic form is a simple sleeping ceremony or ritual that takes place the night before a Turkish wedding. The ceremony consists of the groom tying a "Nikah Kravat" (colorful [[fabric]] or wound [[ribbon]]s used in [[Islam|Muslim]] sacred ceremonies) to the left ankle of the father of the bride and subsequently around his own right ankle. (In some traditions the wrists are tied.) After tying the Nikah Kravat, it must be blessed by the oldest member of the groom's family. This individual must place his (or her) hand over the central knot of the Nikah Kravat and recite the Evlilik Dua Daima, a Muslim [[prayer]] meant to unite the two families. To cement the bond of the Evlilik Dua Daima, the [[bridegroom]] and father in law to be must stay bound until dawn on the day of the wedding.

==Historical References==
The first mention of the Aptal Nisan comes from texts written in the 1670s about the [[Imperial Harem]] during the [[Köprülü era]] (1656–1703), a short time after the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] victory at the [[Battle of Talas]], which ensured Abbasid influence in [[Central Asia]]. At this time, many of the various [[Turkic tribes]]—including the [[Oghuz Turks]], who were the ancestors of both the [[Seljuk Turks|Seljuks]] and the Ottomans—gradually converted to Islam, and brought the religion with them to [[Anatolia]] beginning in the 17th century. It is presumed that the Aptal Nisan was one of the many traditions adopted during this period.

==Meaning==
In Turkish tradition, the meaning of Aptal Nisan can vary depending upon region, but the basis of the ritual is for the groom to demonstrate his commitment to bind himself to the bride's family and for the [[marriage]] to receive luck and blessings. He and the father of the bride do so bound together in sleep, a time of great vulnerability. In the early days of this tradition, the father of the bride may have only met the groom a few times before if at all since most marriages were arranged. It was not unheard of for the groom to abandon a marriage the night before the ceremony, especially if the bridal [[dower]] was high or if he was not emotionally committed to the union. By physically tying himself to the father of the bride, the groom allayed the fears of the bride’s family regarding [[abandonment (legal)#Abandonment of family|abandonment]]. However, because of the vulnerability of sleep, it was common for the bride’s uncles and brothers to sleep nearby to attend and watch over the father of the bride for his safety. However, as time has gone on and arranged marriages have all but disappeared in Turkish tradition, the abandonment portion of this tradition has become relatively unimportant. The main reason the Aptal Nisan has stayed an active part of the Turkish wedding tradition through modern times is for good luck in the marriage. To this day, it is held by the Turkish people that the Evlilik Dua Daima prayer will transfer [[wisdom]] to the groom from the father in law and will bless the marriage with happiness and [[fertility]]. As such, this is a very common practice in modern Turkish weddings.

==Regional Differences==
The main regional differences in the Aptal Nisan center on the way in which the Nikah Kravat is tied. In the Anatolian peninsula, it is common to tie a longer Nikah Kravat with a triple layered [[knot]] and the tie is made to the ankles. In the [[Balkans|Balkan region]], the Nikah Kravat is much shorter and employs a simple single knot and is tied around the wrists.

'''Artistic license''' (also known as '''art license''', '''historical license''', '''dramatic license''', '''poetic license''', '''narrative license''', '''licentia poetica''', '''creative license''', or simply '''license''') is a colloquial term, sometimes a [[euphemism]], used to denote the distortion of fact, alteration of the conventions of [[grammar]] or language, or rewording of pre-existing text made by an [[artist]] in the name of [[art]].

==History==
The artistic license may also refer to the ability of an artist to apply smaller distortions, such as a poet ignoring some of the minor requirements of grammar for poetic effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Harvey, Thomas Wadleigh |year=2008 |title=A Practical Grammar of the English Language |publisher=BiblioBazaar, LLC. |page=263}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Mark Antony]]'s "Friends, Romans, Countrymen, lend me your ears" from [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' would technically require the word "and" before "countrymen", but the conjunction "and" is omitted to preserve the rhythm of [[iambic pentameter]] (the resulting conjunction is called an [[Asyndeton|asyndetic]] [[tricolon]]). Conversely, on the next line, the end of "I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him" has an extra syllable because omitting the word "him" would make the sentence unclear, but adding a syllable at the end would not disrupt the meter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Herzberg, Max John |year=1933 |title=Off to Arcady: adventures in poetry |publisher=American book co. |page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these are examples of artistic license. 

Another example of artistic license is the way in which stylized images of an object (for instance in a [[stylized painting|painting]] or an [[stylized animation|animated movie]]) are different from their real life counterparts, but are still intended to be interpreted by the viewer as representing the same thing. This can mean the omission of details, or the simplification of shapes and color shades, even to the point that the image is nothing more than a [[pictogram]]. It can also mean the addition of non-existing details, or exaggeration of shapes and colours, as in [[fantasy art]] or a [[caricature]].

Certain stylizations have become fixed conventions in art; an agreement between artist and viewer that is understood and undebatable. A striking example is how in simple cartoon drawings' monochromatic white parts on a dark colored surface are immediately recognized by most viewers to represent the reflection of light on a smooth or wet surface.

In summary, artistic license is:

* Entirely at the artist's discretion
* Intended to be tolerated by the viewer (cf. "willing [[suspension of disbelief]]")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Davis, Tracy C. |year=2005 |title=Do you believe in fairies? The hiss of dramatic license |journal=Theatre Journal |volume=57 |issue=1 |pages=57&amp;ndash;81}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Useful for filling in gaps, whether they be factual, compositional, historical or other gaps&lt;ref&gt;Goodsell, David S.; Johnson, Graham T. (2007). "Filling in the Gaps: Artistic License in Education and Outreach". ''PLoS Biol'' '''5''' (12). {{doi|10.1371/journal.pbio.0050308}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Used consciously or unconsciously, intentionally or unintentionally or in tandem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Esaak, Shelley |url=http://arthistory.about.com/od/artspeak_faqs/f/artisticlicense.htm |title=What is artistic license? |publisher=[[About.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dramatic license==
Artistic license is often referred to as dramatic license when it involves the glamorization of real-world occupations for the sake of exciting television or cinematic experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=D'sa, Benicia |year=2005 |title=Social Studies in the Dark: Using Docudramas to Teach History |journal=The Social Studies |volume=96 |number=1 |pages=9&amp;ndash;13}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ''[[CSI (franchise)|CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'' and other [[police procedural]] programs typically omit completely the more mundane aspects of the occupation such as paperwork, reports, administrative duties and other daily "business-oriented" aspects which in reality often constitute the majority of police work. They will also present other duties with much more action, suspense or drama than would be experienced in reality. The same is also true for many military-oriented adventure stories which often show high-ranking characters being allowed to continuously enter dangerous situations when in reality, they would usually be restricted to command-oriented and administrative duties.

==Controversy and criticism==
Artistic license often provokes [[controversy]] by offending those who resent the reinterpretation of cherished beliefs or previous works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Toplin, Robert Brent |year=2002 |title=Reel history: in defense of Hollywood |publisher=University Press of Kansas |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists often respond to these criticisms by pointing out that their work was not intended to be a [[wikt:verbatim|verbatim]] portrayal of something previous and should be judged only on [[artistic merit]]. Artistic license is a generally accepted practice, particularly when the result is widely acclaimed. [[William Shakespeare]]'s historical plays, for example, are gross distortions of historical fact but are nevertheless lauded as outstanding literary works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Barroll, J. Leeds |year=1975 |title=Shakespeare Studies: An Annual Gathering of Research, Criticism, Reviews |publisher=Ayer Publishing |page=306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical voices are sometimes raised when artistic license is applied to cinematic and other depictions of real historical events. While slight manipulation for dramatic effect of chronology and character traits are generally accepted, some critics feel that depictions that present a significantly altered reality are irresponsible, particularly because many viewers and readers do not know the actual events and may thus take the dramatized depiction to be true to reality. Examples of films and television series criticized for excessive use of dramatic license include Disney's ''[[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]]'', Oliver Stone's ''[[Alexander (2004 film)|Alexander]]'', the HBO series ''[[Rome (TV series)|Rome]]'', 20th Century Fox's ''[[The Greatest Showman]]'' and Showtime's ''[[The Tudors]]''. 

Writers adapting a work for another medium (e.g., a film screenplay from a book) often make significant changes, additions to, or omissions from the original plot in the book, on the grounds that these changes were necessary to make a good film.&lt;ref&gt;''Film review'' (1999). Issues 14-16. Orpheus Pub.&lt;/ref&gt; These changes are sometimes to the dismay of fans of the original work.

&lt;!-- This article may require editing to conform to the Neutral Point of View policy. Please see the talk page to discuss this. (This seems to be mostly related to the article's title) --&gt;
A '''changing room''', '''locker room''', '''dressing room''' (usually in a sports, theater or staff context) or '''changeroom''' (regional use) is a room or area designated for changing one's clothes. Changing rooms are provided in a semi-public situation to enable people to change clothes with varying degrees of privacy.

Separate changing rooms may be [[Sex segregation|provided for men and women]], or there may be a non-gender-specific open space with individual cubicles or stalls,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edmonton.ca/city_government/projects_redevelopment/universal-change-room.aspx Queen Elizabeth Pool, Edmonton, Canada] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927015609/http://www.edmonton.ca/city_government/projects_redevelopment/universal-change-room.aspx |date=September 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as with [[unisex public toilet]]s. Many changing rooms include toilets and showers. Sometimes a changing room exists as a small portion of a [[public toilet]]. For example, the men's and women's washrooms in Toronto's [[Dundas Square]] (which includes a waterplay area) each include a change area which is a blank counter space at the end of a row of sinks. In this case, the facility is primarily a washroom, and its use as a changing room is minimal, since only a small percentage of users change into [[bathing suit]]s. Sometimes a person may change his or her clothes in a toilet cubicle of a washroom. 

Larger changing rooms are usually found at public beaches, or other bathing areas, where most of the space is for changing, and minimal washroom space is included. Beach-style changing rooms are often large open rooms with benches against the walls. Some do not have a roof, providing just the barrier necessary to prevent people outside from seeing in.

==Types==

[[File:Changeroom symbol on sign close up.jpg|thumb|left|Changeroom sign.]]

Various types of changing rooms exist.

* '''Changing stalls''' are small stalls where clothes can be changed in privacy. They are used for swimming purposes.
* '''Locker rooms''' are usually gender-specific spaces where clothes are changed and stored in [[Locker (cabinet)|locker]]s. They are often used for swimming or other sporting purposes. They are open spaces with no stalls. In addition, these room contain showers.
* '''Fitting rooms''', or '''dressing rooms''', are usually small single-user cubicles where a person may try on clothes. These are often found at retail stores where one would want to try on clothes before purchasing them.
* '''Green rooms''' and '''trap rooms''' are usually mixed-gender backstage or under-stage changing spaces found at theaters and other similar venues.

=== Changing stalls ===
Changing stalls are small stalls where clothes can be changed in privacy. Clothes are usually stored in [[Locker (cabinet)|locker]]s. There are usually no separate areas for men and women. They are often combined with gender-separated communal showers. Most public pools have changing facilities of this kind alongside communal changing rooms.

===Communal changing rooms===
[[File:Lockers in modern change room.JPG|thumb|right|Lockers and bench in change room]]
Locker rooms are thus named because they provide lockers for the storage of one's belongings. Alternatively, they may have a locker room attendant who will keep a person's belongings until one comes to retrieve them. Locker rooms are usually open spaces where people change together, but there are separate areas, or separate locker rooms, for men and women. Sometimes they are used in swimming complexes.

[[Lock (security device)|Locking]] devices used in locker rooms have traditionally been key or coin lockers, or lockers that are secured with a [[combination lock]]. Newer locker rooms may be automated, with robotic machines to store clothes, with such features as a fingerprint scanner to enrol and for later retrieval. Locker rooms in some waterparks use a microchip equipped wristband. The same wristband that unlocks the lockers can be used to purchase food and drinks and other items in the waterpark.

Some communal changing rooms are only supposed to be used by groups of persons, not individuals. In this case, there may be no lockers. Instead, the entire room is locked in order to protect belongings from theft.

Locker rooms are also used in many middle schools and high schools. Most of them include showers for after Physical Education.

=== (Store) fitting rooms ===
[[File:Changeroom.jpg|thumb|left|A changeroom in a department store]]
[[File:Cabines-d'essayage-Copenhague.jpg|thumb|right|A block of clothing store fitting rooms in Denmark]]
[[File:ClothingStoreChangeroomSignDSCF0024.JPG|thumb|right|Changeroom sign in clothing store]]
Fitting rooms, or "dressing rooms", are rooms where people try on clothes, such as in a department store. The rooms are usually individual rooms in which a person tries on clothes to determine fit before making a purchase. People do not always use the fitting rooms to change, as to change implies to remove one set of clothes and put on another. Sometimes a person chooses to try on clothes over their clothes (such as [[sweater]]s or [[Coat (clothing)|coat]]s), but would still like to do this in private. Thus fitting rooms may be used for changing, or just for fitting without changing.

====Rules and conventions====
Retail establishments often post rules such as maximum number of items allowed in changing room, e.g. "no more than 4 items allowed in changing room".

==== History ====
It appears that the first store fitting rooms appeared with the spread of [[department stores]].&lt;ref name="Caro"&gt;« ''Essayer en corps. Sociologie des cabines d'essayage'' », Thierry Caro, mémoire de fin d'études à l'[[Institut d'études politiques de Lille]], 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Émile Zola]] noted their existence in his novel ''[[Au Bonheur des Dames]]'' (1883), and that they were then forbidden to men.&lt;ref name="Caro"/&gt; Some years later, when [[Henri Gervex]], who painted [[Jeanne Paquin]] in 1906, that was no longer the case.{{clarify|date=April 2014}}&lt;ref name="Caro"/&gt;

In any case, [[Buster Keaton]] worked in one in an American 1928 [[silent film|silent]] comedy ''[[The Cameraman]]''.&lt;ref name="Caro"/&gt; Since then, they have continued to provide comic scenes in films, for example in the  1995 French film ''[[Les Trois Frères]]''.&lt;ref name="Caro"/&gt;

===Green rooms===
A [[green room]] is a room located backstage in a theatre or some such performance space where the actors (musicians, dancers etc.) wait before they go onstage. One theory of its naming is that it traditionally has green walls; as green is considered to have a calming effect and is meant to bring focus before the performance and calm nerves. Another is that performers in the green room are "Green to go", ready to go on stage. Green rooms are usually located backstage, but sometimes under the stage, or to the side, they can also be located anywhere where there is room to put a communal space. In exhibition halls and convention centers, Pipe and Drape "rooms" may be constructed as a Green rooms. Green rooms are usually not separated by gender, because performers often change in separate, usually gender segregated, dressing rooms and congregate in the Green Room, once largely or completely in costume to help each other focus and calm nerves of other performers. Green Rooms may be separated by performing group, or the main headliner may have their own Green Room, and the supporting acts share another. Green rooms are often also used on non-show days and during the install and strike of productions as a break room or meeting room, and may contain a fridge, microwave, coffee machine, or water fountain.

===Dressing rooms (domestic)===
In larger Victorian houses it was common to have accessible from the bedroom a [[boudoir]] for the lady of the house and a dressing room for the gentleman&lt;ref&gt;Yorke, Trevor (2005) ''The Victorian House Explained''. Newbury: Countryside Books {{ISBN|9781846748233}}; p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; (see also his [[Cabinet (room)]]).

===Cleansing stations===
{{See also|Baths and wash houses in Britain}}
Before the advent of modern plumbing, there existed a number of places for washing one's clothes and body. Cleansing stations were separated by gender, and combined the function of cleaning clothes with cleaning of the body. The closest modern equivalent would be a combination laundromat plus locker room with showers.

During the nineteenth, and early part of the twentieth century, the increase of urbanization caused an increase in the spread of disease. Poor hygiene was determined to be the cause. Since many families did not have practical means to clean themselves or their clothes, public cleansing stations were established for their use.

==Security==
Because of the privacy afforded by changing rooms, they create a problem in the trade off between security and privacy, where in it may be possible for crime to be perpetrated by people using the cover of privacy to sell drugs, or steal clothing from a department store. Some department stores have security cameras in the changing rooms.&lt;ref&gt;See Phil Patton's article "You don't have to smile", excerpt included in [http://wearcam.org/netcam_privacy_issues.html Netcam Privacy Issues] for more on security cameras in changing rooms&lt;/ref&gt;

Communal changing rooms pose less of a risk of theft than fitting rooms, because there is not total privacy. In particular, the perpetrator of a crime would not know whether or not other users might be undercover police or security guards. Many modern changing rooms often have [[labyrinth]]-style entrances that have no door, so that people outside cannot see in, but security can walk in at any time without the sound of an opening door alerting persons inside. Washrooms in which changing clothes is merely a secondary purpose often also have such labyrinth openings. &lt;!-- "It is this possibility for persons to suddenly appear without warning, that often makes modern style changing rooms and washrooms safe from drug dealing and other crime." &lt;-- this cannot be verifiable--&gt;Many washrooms have security cameras in the main area with a view of the sinks and the urinals from a viewing angle that would only show the back of a user. However, when a washroom is located near a fountain, wading pool, or the like, and is likely to be used for changing clothes, some believe that washroom surveillance cameras would be a violation of privacy.

Another security risk present is that of theft. Sometimes no method of securing items is provided, but even lockable lockers or baskets are usually designed for only minimal security allowing experienced thieves to steal the valuable items which people typically have with them before changing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.travelgayasia.com/blog/gym-locker-theft-in-bangkok/ |title=Gym Locker Theft in Bangkok |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313055437/http://www.travelgayasia.com/blog/gym-locker-theft-in-bangkok/ |archivedate=2013-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ksl.com/?nid=148&amp;sid=16377867 |title=Mysterious gym locker theft leads to string of troubles }}&lt;/ref&gt; Changing room operators frequently post signs waiving responsibility for stolen items, which discourage but do not eliminate claims for negligence.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11972">A '''character arc''' is the transformation or inner journey&lt;ref name="Gerke"&gt;{{harvtxt|Gerke|2010|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a [[character (arts)|character]] over the course of a story. If a story has a character arc, the character begins as one sort of person and gradually transforms into a different sort of person in response to changing developments in the story. Since the change is often substantive and leading from one personality trait to a diametrically opposite trait (for example, from greed to benevolence), the geometric term ''[[Arc (geometry)|arc]]'' is often used to describe the sweeping change. In most stories, [[main character|lead characters]] and [[protagonist]]s are the characters most likely to experience character arcs,&lt;ref name="Bell"&gt;{{harvtxt|Bell|2004|p=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it is possible for lesser characters to change as well.&lt;ref name="Gerke" /&gt; A driving element of the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]]s of many stories is that the main character seems initially unable to overcome opposing forces, possibly because they lack skills or knowledge or resources or friends. To overcome such obstacles, the protagonist must change, possibly by learning new skills, to arrive at a higher sense of self-awareness or capability. Protagonists can achieve such self-awareness by interacting with their environment, by enlisting the help of mentors, by changing their viewpoint, or by some other method.

==Dramatic narrative structure==
{{main|Dramatic structure}}
Throughout the trajectory of narratives with a tripartite structure, character arcs often unfold beside the narrative arc in the following way:

===First act===
During the first act, the character arc is established or re-established for at least one character, the main character (the protagonist), within the exposition (noument) of the environment including relationships to other characters. Later in the first act, a dynamic, on-screen incident, known as the [[Inciting Incident|inciting incident]], or catalyst occurs that confronts the protagonist, whose attempts to deal with this incident lead to a second and more dramatic situation, known as the first [[Climax (narrative)|turning point]].  After the first turning point, life will never be the same for the protagonist and raises a dramatic question that will be answered in the climax of the story. The dramatic question should be framed in terms of the protagonist's call to action, for example, Will X recover the diamond? Will Y get the girl? Will Z capture the killer?&lt;ref name=bible&gt;{{harvtxt|Trottier|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second act===
During the second act, also referred to as "[[rising action]]", the character arc develops as the protagonist attempts to resolve the problem initiated by the first turning point, only to discover ever-worsening situations, which often lead to the learning of new skills, the discovery of capabilities, and (sometimes late in the second act if at all) the raising of self-awareness.&lt;ref name=bible /&gt;

===Third act===
During the third act, including the climax, "[[falling action]]" and resolution (denouement), the narrative arc is completed although the character arc typically is not.  During the climax, because the main tensions of the story are brought to their most intense point and the dramatic question is answered, a character arc reaches a place where the character gains a new sense of who they are becoming.  As the plot and its subplots resolve, the character arc's emphasis shifts from the learning of any new skills or the discovery of dormant capabilities to the awakening of a higher level of self-awareness, which in turn changes who the character is becoming.&lt;ref name=bible /&gt;

== Examples ==

=== In literature ===
Some examples include:

* [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'' sees the eponymous character, once a young scholarly prince full of promise, quickly becoming a melancholic brooder after his father's death. The play shows his slow but deadly fall into madness.
* In [[Dostoevsky]]'s ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'', the protagonist [[Raskolnikov]] commits a murder, that leads him on a path of redemption, and after an intense inner struggle, he realizes that he needs to be punished for his actions, reporting himself to the authorities.
* [[Victor Hugo]]'s ''[[Les Misérables]]'' includes a myriad of characters that transform against the backdrop of social events. [[Jean Valjean]] starts as a selfish, violent convict and develops into a generous and loving father to [[Cosette]], who in turn transforms from an abused, lonely and somewhat secluded child to a beautiful and caring woman.
* [[Ursula Le Guin]]'s protagonist from her ''[[A Wizard of Earthsea]]'' quartet gradually changes from an impulsive and arrogant youth to a stoic and wise man, reconciling the darkness within and all the bad actions it had caused.
* ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' series of books by [[George R.R. Martin]] shows numerous examples of complete character arcs. [[Daenerys Targaryen]] transforms from a naive young girl to a queen and a conqueror, only to fall from grace after a misuse of power. The character of [[Jon Snow (character)|Jon Snow]], undergoes a similar arc of embracing the need to govern and rule and metaphorically "kills the boy and lets the man be born" only to die after a misuse of power. Other characters such as [[Sansa Stark]] and [[Jaime Lannister]], start out as childish and petty, but once faced with the cruelty of the world, Jaime grows into a mature and wise leader, and Sansa grows into a strong-willed and poised lady.

=== In film ===
Some examples include:

* In ''[[Tootsie]]'', [[Dustin Hoffman]]'s character begins as a [[misogynist]]ic [[chauvinist]] but when he is forced to play the part of a woman, he also experiences a change in how he views women and becomes a different character by the end.
* In ''[[Empire of the Sun (film)|Empire of the Sun]]'', Jim begins as a carefree young boy.  After the Japanese take over [[Shanghai]] and he is separated from his family, he is forced to suffer trauma because of the war.
* In ''[[The Godfather]]'' (1972), widely regarded as one of the [[greatest films ever made]], Michael Corleone initially wants nothing to do with the crime business of his father, Don Vito Corleone. When Vito is critically injured in a shooting, however, Michael gradually becomes more involved in a war of retribution on those responsible. This, effectively and ironically, sets him down the path to becoming Don of the Corleone crime syndicate. Its acclaimed sequel, ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' (1974), chronicles Michael's effective fall from grace as a result of becoming a powerful crime lord.
* In ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' (1976), Travis Bickle degenerates from a somewhat disturbed, highly disorganized Vietnam war veteran into an obsessive psychotic.
* In ''[[Goodfellas]]'' (1990), [[Henry Hill]] (played by [[Ray Liotta]]) goes from being a suave and sophisticated gangster to a paranoid nervous wreck due to a severe [[cocaine]] addiction.
* In ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]'', [[Elsa (Disney)|Elsa]] begins the movie embracing her ice powers. After injuring her sister  [[Anna (Disney)|Anna]] she becomes scared of her powers and considers herself a monster. After her sister sacrifices herself, Elsa finally embraces her powers again. Anna begins the movie as a social butterfly willing to throw herself into any man's arms. After [[Hans (Disney)|Hans]] betrays her, Anna learns that looks can sometimes be deceiving.
*In ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'', the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] begins a story arc dealing with accepting himself as one person rather than seeing Bruce Banner separate. It continues in ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' and will conclude in ''[[Untitled Avengers film|Avengers 4]]''.

=== In television ===
Like a [[story arc]], which often is composed of many [[dramatic structure|narrative arcs]], the character arc is not confined within the limits of one narrative.  The character arc may extend over to the next story, a [[sequel]], or another episode.  In episodic [[TV series]], the character arc functions as a [[narrative hook]] that writers often use to ensure viewers continue watching.

* The TV series ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' made heavy use of character arcs throughout its run, with story arcs (or mysteries, as the show was famed for) normally being used to move the plot along in the background, as the four protagonists, [[Susan Mayer]], [[Lynette Scavo]], [[Bree Van de Kamp]], and [[Gabrielle Solis]], dealt with their various foibles and flaws, through the eyes of their dead friend and neighbour, [[Mary Alice Young]].
* Over the course of the television series ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]'' (first US air date: {{start date|1995|9}}), [[Gabrielle (Xena)|Gabrielle]] starts from a young, idealistic Greek farm girl to becoming a warrior, and in the end, she becomes [[Xena]]'s successor.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}
*''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' focuses on character arcs for each of the survivors of a plane crash. [[Jack Shephard]] accepting his role as protector of the island, [[James "Sawyer" Ford]] going from a self-centered con-man to a mature leader, [[John Locke (Lost)|John Locke]]'' discovering his destiny on the island.

* ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'' (first US air date: {{start date|2001|10}}) focuses on character arcs for each of its main characters as they progress into their ''[[Superman]]'' comic book identities. [[Clark Kent]]'s arc revolved around the gradual acceptance of his destiny and becoming a hero. The series also tracks [[Lex Luthor]]'s progression into darkness and [[Lois Lane]]'s emulation of her cousin [[Chloe Sullivan|Chloe]] as she becomes a hardened journalist. Other characters have their eventual character arc alluded to but never explicitly defined or realized onscreen, such as [[Perry White]]'s rise to editor of the ''[[Daily Planet]]'' and [[Lex Luthor]]'s ascension to [[President of the United States]]. As well as individual characters, there are arcs involving many characters which intertwine to tell about the formation of the [[Justice League]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}
*In ''[[Breaking Bad]],'' [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]] begins as a high school chemistry teacher struggling with a serious illness while trying to support his family financially. His decision to become a manufacturer of addictive illegal drugs starts a downward spiral in which his wife, [[Skyler White]], divorces him, and his character ''arcs'' from a morally responsible regular guy into a dangerous monster.
* The teen drama series ''[[13 Reasons Why]]'' features two character arcs for its protagonist Clay Jensen: In the flashbacks, Clay begins as a shy young man until meeting [[Hannah Baker]]. In the present, after Hannah's death, he becomes emotionally withdrawn until listening to the tapes left behind by his former friend. After learning the truth, he becomes a warrior and a voice of justice for Hannah.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2642">'''Cultural emphasis''' is an important aspect of a culture which is often reflected though language and, more specifically, vocabulary (Ottenheimer, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;266).  This means that the vocabulary people use in a culture indicates what is important to that group of people.  If there are a lot of words to describe a certain topic in a specific culture, then there is a good chance that that topic is considered important to that culture.

== Background ==
The idea of cultural emphasis is rooted form the work of Franz Boas, who is considered to be one of the founders of American Anthropology (Ottenheimer, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;15). Franz Boas developed and taught concepts such as [[cultural relativism]] and the "cultural unconscious", which allowed anthropologists who studied under him, like [[Edward Sapir]] and [[Ruth Benedict]], to further study and develop ideas on language and culture (Hart, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;179).

== Application ==
One way in which cultural emphasis is exemplified is a populace talks about the weather.  For example, in a place where it is cold and it snows a lot, a large collection of words to describe the snow would be expected.

:For example: [[Whiteout (weather)|whiteout]], [[blizzard]], [[Ice storm|sleeting]], [[snowdrift]], powder snow, packed snow, fresh snow.

In a place where it is hot, a cornucopia of associated terms would be expected.

:For example: dry heat, muggy, humid, sticky, monsoon season, sweltering.
A concentration of related terms for similar phenomena suggests the importance in distinguishing between them.  Furthermore, if you are not from the area, or that culture, you might not have experienced or know the difference between, for example, a dry heat or a humid heat, when the difference may have huge implications for the outcome of a particular action.

[[Image:Motherhood and apple pie.jpg|thumb|300px||right|Apple pie, baseball, and the United States flag are three American cultural icons]]

A '''cultural icon''' is an [[cultural artifact|artifact]] that is identified by members of a culture as representative of that culture. The process of identification is subjective, and "icons" are judged by the extent to which they can be seen as an authentic proxy of that culture. When individuals perceive a cultural icon, they relate it to their general perceptions of the cultural identity represented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grayson|first=Kent|last2=Martinec|first2=Radan|date=2004-09-01|title=Consumer Perceptions of Iconicity and Indexicality and Their Influence on Assessments of Authentic Market Offerings|url=https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/31/2/296/1824949/Consumer-Perceptions-of-Iconicity-and-Indexicality|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|volume=31|issue=2|pages=296–312|doi=10.1086/422109|issn=0093-5301}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural icons can also be identified as an authentic representation of the practices of one culture by another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Motley|first=Carol M.|last2=Henderson|first2=Geraldine Rosa|date=2008-03-01|title=The global hip-hop Diaspora: Understanding the culture|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0148296307001609|journal=Journal of Business Research|series=Cross-Cultural Business Research|volume=61|issue=3|pages=243–253|doi=10.1016/j.jbusres.2007.06.020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[mass media|media]], many items and persons of [[popular culture]] have been called "iconic" despite their lack of durability; and the term "[[pop icon]]" is often now used. Some commentators believe that the word is overused or misused.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-3713610.html Heard about the famous icon?

==Criticism==
Describing something as ''iconic'' or as an ''icon'' has become very common in the popular media. This has drawn criticism from some: a writer in ''[[Liverpool Daily Post]]'' calls "iconic" "a word that makes my flesh creep", a word "pressed into service to describe almost anything."&lt;ref name="LDP"&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-191891103.html Let's hear it for the Queen's English], ''[[Liverpool Daily Post]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[Christian Examiner]]'' nominates "iconic" in its list of overused words, finding over 18,000 "iconic" references in news stories alone, with another 30,000 for "icon", including its use for ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]''.&lt;ref name="CE"&gt;[http://www.christianexaminer.com/Articles/Articles%20Aug09/Art_Aug09_oped2.html Modern word usage amazingly leaves us yearning for gay, old times] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225101358/http://www.christianexaminer.com/Articles/Articles%20Aug09/Art_Aug09_oped2.html |date=2010-12-25 }}, ''[[Christian Examiner]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Because memory is not just an individual, private experience but is also part of the collective domain, '''cultural memory''' has become a topic in both [[historiography]] ([[Pierre Nora]], Richard Terdiman) and [[cultural studies]] (e.g., [[Susan Stewart (poet)|Susan Stewart]]). These emphasize cultural memory’s process (historiography) and its implications and objects (cultural studies), respectively. Two schools of thought have emerged, one articulates that the present shapes our understanding of the past. The other assumes that the past has an influence on our present behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Barry. 1991. "Social Change and Collective Memory: The Democratization of George Washington." American Sociological Review 56: 221-236&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, B. (2010). 'Culture and Collective Memory: Two Comparative Perspectives'. In. Hall, J. R.; Grindstaff, L. and Lo, M-C. ''Handbook of Cultural Sociology''. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historiographical approach==

===Time===

Crucial in understanding cultural memory as a phenomenon is the distinction between memory and [[history]].  This distinction was put forward by [[Pierre Nora]], who pinpointed a niche in-between history and memory.

Scholars disagree as to when to locate the moment representation 'took over'. Nora points to the formation of European [[nation state]]s. For [[Richard Terdiman]], the [[French revolution]] is the breaking point: the change of a political system, together with the emergence of [[industrialization]] and [[urbanization]], made life more complex than ever before. This not only resulted in an increasing difficulty for people to understand the new society in which they were living, but also, as this break was so radical, people had trouble relating to the past ''before'' the revolution. In this situation, people no longer had an implicit understanding of their past. In order to understand the past, it had to be represented through history. As people realized that history was only one version of the past, they became more and more concerned with their own [[cultural heritage]] (in French called ''patrimoine'') which helped them shape a collective and [[national identity]]. In search for an identity to bind a country or people together, governments have constructed collective memories in the form of commemorations which should bring and keep together minority groups and individuals with conflicting agendas. What becomes clear is that the obsession with memory coincides with the fear of [[forgetting]] and the aim for [[Authentication|authenticity]].

However, more recently questions have arisen whether there ever was a time in which 'pure', non-representational memory existed – as Nora in particular put forward. Scholars like [[Tony Bennett (sociologist)|Tony Bennett]] rightly point out that representation is a crucial precondition for human perception in general: pure, organic and objective memories can never be witnessed as such.

===Space===

It is because of a sometimes too contracted conception of memory as just a temporal phenomenon, that the concept of cultural memory has often been exposed to misunderstanding. Nora pioneered connecting memory to physical, tangible locations, nowadays globally known and incorporated as ''lieux de mémoire''. He certifies these in his work as ''mises en abîme''; entities that symbolize a more complex piece of our history. Although he concentrates on a spatial approach to remembrance, Nora already points out in his early historiographical theories that memory goes beyond just tangible and visual aspects, thereby making it flexible and in flux. This rather problematic notion, also characterized by Terdiman as the '[[omnipresence]]' of memory, implies that for instance on a sensory level, a smell or a sound can become of cultural value, due to its commemorative effect.

Either in visualized or abstracted form, one of the largest complications of memorializing our past is the inevitable fact that it is absent. Every memory we try to reproduce becomes – as Terdiman states – a 'present past'. It is this impractical desire for recalling what is gone forever that brings to surface a feeling of [[nostalgia]], noticeable in many aspects of daily life but most specifically in cultural products.

==Cultural studies approach==

===Embodied memory===

Recently, interest has developed in the area of '[[Embodied cognition|embodied]] memory'. According to [[Paul Connerton]] the body can also be seen as a container, or carrier of memory, of two different types of social practice; inscribing and incorporating. The former includes all activities which are helpful for storing and retrieving information: photographing, writing, taping, etc. The latter implies skilled performances which are sent by means of physical activity, like a spoken word or a handshake. These performances are accomplished by the individual in an unconscious manner, and one might suggest that this memory carried in gestures and habits, is more authentic than 'indirect' memory via inscribing.

The first conceptions of embodied memory, in which the past is 'situated' in the body of the individual, derive from late nineteenth century thoughts of [[evolutionist]]s like [[Jean Baptiste Lamarck]] and [[Ernst Haeckel]]. Lamarck’s law of [[inheritance of acquired characteristics]] and Haeckel's theory of [[recapitulation theory|ontogeny recapitulating phylogeny]], suggested that the individual is a summation of the whole history that had preceded him or her. (However, neither of these concepts is accepted by current science.)

===Objects===

Memory can, for instance, be contained in objects. [[Souvenir]]s and [[photograph]]s inhabit an important place in the cultural memory discourse. Several authors stress the fact that the relationship between memory and objects has changed since the nineteenth century. Stewart, for example, claims that our culture has changed from a culture of production to a culture of consumption. Products, according to Terdiman, have lost 'the memory of their own process' now, in times of [[mass-production]] and [[commodification]]. At the same time, he claims, the connection between memories and objects has been institutionalized and exploited in the form of trade in souvenirs. These specific objects can refer to either a distant time (an [[antique]]) or a distant (exotic) place. Stewart explains how our souvenirs authenticate our experiences and how they are a survival sign of events that exist only through the invention of [[narrative]].

This notion can easily be applied to another practice that has a specific relationship with memory: [[photography]]. Catherine Keenan explains how the act of taking a picture can underline the importance of remembering, both individually and collectively. Also she states that pictures cannot only stimulate or help memory, but can rather eclipse the actual memory – when we remember in terms of the photograph – or they can serve as a reminder of our propensity to forget. Others have argued that photographs can be incorporated in memory and therefore supplement it.

[[Edward Chaney]] has coined the term 'Cultural Memorials' to describe both generic types, such as obelisks or sphinxes, and specific objects, such as the Obelisk of Domitian, Abu Simbel or 'The Young Memnon', which have meanings attributed to them that evolve over time. Readings of ancient Egyptian artefacts by [[Herodotus]], [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], the Collector [[Earl of Arundel]], 18th-century travellers, [[Napoleon]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]], [[William John Bankes|William Bankes]], [[Harriet Martineau]], [[Florence Nightingale]] or Sigmund and Lucian [[Freud]], reveal a range of interpretations variously concerned with reconstructing the intentions of their makers.

==Between culture and memory: experience==

As a contrast to the sometimes generative nature of previously mentioned studies on cultural memory, an alternative 'school' with its origins in [[gender]] and postcolonial studies underscored the importance of the individual and particular memories of those unheard in most collective accounts: women, minorities, homosexuals, etc.

[[Experience]], whether it be lived or imagined, relates mutually to culture and memory. It is influenced by both factors, but determines these at the same time. Culture influences experience by offering mediated perceptions that affect it, as Frigga Haug states by opposing conventional theory on femininity to lived memory. In turn, as historians such as Neil Gregor have argued, experience affects culture, since individual experience becomes communicable and therefore collective.  A memorial, for example, can represent a shared sense of loss.

The influence of memory is made obvious in the way the past is experienced in present conditions, for – according to Paul Connerton, for instance – it can never be eliminated from human practice. On the other hand, it is perception driven by a longing for authenticity that colors memory, which is made clear by a desire to experience the real (Susan Stewart). Experience, therefore, is substantial to the interpretation of culture as well as memory, and vice versa.

==Traumatic memory transmission==
{{Main|Transgenerational trauma}}
Traumatic transmissions are articulated over time not only through social sites or institutions but also through cultural, political, and familial generations, a key social mechanism of continuity and renewal across human groups, cohorts, and communities. The intergenerational transmission of collective trauma is a well-established phenomenon in the scholarly literature on psychological, familial, sociocultural, and biological modes of transmission. Ordinary processes of remembering and transmission can be understood as cultural practices by which people recognize a lineage, a debt to their past, and through which "they express moral continuity with that past."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = State Terrorism and the Politics of Memory in Latin America: Transmissions Across The Generations of Post-Dictatorship Uruguay, 1984–2004|last = Fried Amilivia|first = Gabriela|publisher = Cambria Press|year = 2016|isbn = 9781604979190|location = Amherst, New York|pages = 24, 26|url = http://www.cambriapress.com/books/9781604979190.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Intergenerationality|intergenerational preservation]], transformation, and transmutation of traumatic memory such as of [[genocide]] tragic historical legacy can be assimilated, redeemed, and transformed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adelman|first1=A.|title=Traumatic memory and the intergenerational transmission of Holocaust narratives|journal=The Psychoanalytic Study of the Child|date=1995|volume=50|pages=343–367|issn=0079-7308|doi=10.1080/00797308.1995.11822409|pmid=7480412}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studies==
Recent research and theorizing in cultural memory has emphasized the importance of considering the content of cultural identities in understanding the study of social relations and predicting cultural attitudes.

The Institute of Germanic &amp; Romance Studies, School of Advanced Study, University of London, has developed its MA degree around the above-mentioned topics.

The [https://web.archive.org/web/20100222220029/http://igrs.sas.ac.uk/postgraduate/mamres-programmes/cultural-memory.html MA in Cultural Memory] has now been running for 10 years. This unique degree explores the many different ways in which culture is based on the construction, manipulation and transmission of memories, and the role played by memory in collective and individual identity formation.

The degree programme is supplemented by a Cultural Memory Seminar and by the [http://modernlanguages.sas.ac.uk new Centre for the Study of Cultural Memory].

In 2008, the first issue of quarterly journal ''[[Memory Studies (journal)|Memory Studies]]'' concerning subjects of and relating to cultural memory was published by [[SAGE Publications|SAGE]].

== Other approaches ==
[[Jan Assmann]] in his book "Das kulturelle Gedächtnis", drew further upon [[Maurice Halbwachs]]'s theory on [[collective memory]].&lt;ref&gt;Assmann, J. (1992) ''Das Kulturelle Gedächtnis: Schrift, Erinnerung und Politische Identität in frühen Hochkulturen.'' Munich: Verlag C.H. Beck&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars like [[Andreas Huyssen]] have identified a general interest in memory and [[mnemonics]] since the early 1980s, illustrated by phenomena as diverse as [[memorial]]s and [[retro]]-culture.  Some might see cultural memory as becoming more democratic, due to liberalization and the rise of [[new media]].  Others see cultural memory as remaining concentrated in the hands of corporations and states.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

'''Cultural retention''' is the act of retaining the [[culture]] of a specific [[ethnicity|ethnic]] group of people, especially when there is reason to believe that the culture, through inaction, may be lost. Many African-American, European and Asian organizations have cultural retention programs in place.

The '''cultural turn''' is a movement beginning in the early 1970s among scholars in the [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]] to make [[culture]] the focus of contemporary debates; it also describes a shift in emphasis toward ''meaning'' and away from a [[positivist]] [[epistemology]]. The cultural turn is described in 2005 by [[Lynette Spillman]] and [[Mark D. Jacobs]] as "one of the most influential trends in the humanities and social sciences in the last generation".&lt;ref name="Cultural sociology at the crossroads of the discipline"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jacobs|first1=Mark|last2=Spillman|first2=Lynette|title=Cultural sociology at the crossroads of the discipline|journal=Poetics|date=2005|volume=33|issue=1|pages=1–14|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304422X05000045 |deadurl=no |accessdate=25 March 2017|doi=10.1016/j.poetic.2005.01.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; A prominent [[historiographer]] argues that the cultural turn involved a "wide array of new theoretical impulses coming from fields formerly peripheral to the social sciences",&lt;ref name="steinmetz1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Steinmetz|first=G|title=State/Culture: State-Formation after the Cultural Turn|year=1999|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, NY|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially [[post-structuralism]], cultural studies, literary criticism, and various forms of linguistic analysis, which emphasized "the causal and socially constitutive role of cultural processes and systems of signification".&lt;ref name="steinmetz1"/&gt;

==Background==
The cultural turn in the late 20th century is interpreted as referring to either a substantive shift in society or an analytical shift in academia. The former argues that culture plays a more significant role in advanced societies, which fits with the notion of [[post-modernity]] as an historical era in which people "emphasizes the importance of art and culture for education, moral growth, and social criticism and change".&lt;ref name="sociologyencyclopedia2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Steven|first1=Best|title=Culture Turn|journal=Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology |date=2007 |doi=10.1111/b.9781405124331.2007.x |url=http://www.sociologyencyclopedia.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405124331_yr2013_chunk_g97814051243319_ss1-202|accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter is movement within academia to place the concept of culture, and the related notions of ''meaning'', ''cognition'', ''affect'', and ''symbols'' at the center of methodological and theoretical focus. Some argue that the analytical shift is endogenous to the substantive shift.&lt;ref name="sociologyencyclopedia2007"/&gt;

Culture can be defined as "the social process whereby people communicate meanings, make sense of their world, construct their identities, and define their beliefs and values".&lt;ref name="sociologyencyclopedia2007"/&gt; Or, for [[Georg Simmel]], [[culture]] refers to "the cultivation of individuals through the agency of external forms which have been objectified in the course of history". Thus culture can be interpreted on a spectrum from purely individualistic [[solipsism]] to objective forms of social organization and interaction.

==History==

===Analytical shift===
One of the earliest works in which the term "cultural turn" showed up was [[Jeffrey C. Alexander]]'s chapter "The New Theoretical Movement" in [[Neil Smelser]]'s ''Handbook of Sociology'' (1988).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alexander|first=Jeffrey|title=Handbook of Sociology|year=1988|publisher=Sage Publications|location=Beverly Hills, CA|pages=77–101|editor=Smelser, N. J.|chapter=The New Theoretical Movement}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander, rightly pointed out that the origins of the cultural turn should be traced in the debate of idealism and materialism i.e. Marx and Hegel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|last=Eyerman|first=Ron|title=Jeffrey Alexander and the Cultural Turn in Social Theory|year=2004|publisher=Thesis Eleven&amp;#124;No. 79|pages=25–30|}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the labeling of the movement, in the 1970s, "foundational works underlying and facilitating the turn to cultural forms of analysis" emerged: [[Hayden White]]'s ''[[Metahistory: The Historical Imagination in Nineteenth-Century Europe]]'' (1973), [[Clifford Geertz]]'s ''The Interpretation of Cultures: Selected Essays'' (1973), [[Michel Foucault]]'s ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' (1977), and [[Pierre Bourdieu]]'s ''Outline of a Theory of Practice'' (1977).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bonnell, V. E.  |author2=Hunt, L.|title=Beyond the Cultural Turn|year=1999|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the earlier twentieth century experienced a linguistic turn, mostly brought about by the thought of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], the cultural turn of the late twentieth century absorbed those criticisms and built on them.

The cultural turn has helped [[cultural studies]] to gain more respect as an academic discipline. With the shift away from [[high culture|high arts]] the discipline has increased its perceived importance and influence on other disciplines.

British historian Heather Jones argues that the [[World War I#Historiography|historiography of the First World War]] has been reinvigorated by the cultural turn in recent years.  Scholars have raised entirely new questions regarding military occupation, radicalizion of politics, race, and the male body.&lt;ref&gt;Heather Jones,  "As the centenary approaches: the regeneration of First World War historiography." ''Historical Journal'' (2013) 56#3 pp: 857-878&lt;/ref&gt;

===Substantive shift===
The cultural turn as an historical era that breaks substantively with the past is only tangentially related to cultural turn as analytical shift. Proponents of the former argue that:

{{quote|“The very sphere of culture itself has expanded, becoming coterminous with market society in such a way that the cultural is no longer limited to its earlier, traditional or experimental forms, but it is consumed throughout daily life itself, in shopping, in professional activities, in the various often televisual forms of leisure, in production for the market and in the consumption of those market products, indeed in the most secret folds and corners of the quotidian. Social space is now completely saturated with the image of culture.”|[[Fredric Jameson]]| 1998, p. 111&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jameson|first=Fredric|title=The Cultural Turn: Selected Writings on the Postmodern, 1983-1998|year=1998|publisher=Verso|location=Brooklyn}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Advertising]], [[amateur photography]], [[yellow journalism]] and an assortment of other forms of media arose after the politically charged 1960s. Moreover, this media was [[multicultural]], and attempted to target all races, ethnicities and age groups, as opposed to more exclusive media prior to the 1960s. This "[[new media]]" of a [[postmodern]] America brought about an expansion and differentiation of culture, which has only been rapidly expanded by the [[Internet]] and [[social media]].

==In rural studies==
In recent years, there has been something of a resurgence in [[rural studies]], which has become somewhat more mainstream than previously in the academic space of social science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Woods|first=M|title=Rural geography|date=2005|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing numbers of people have taken on important dualistic questions of society/space, nature/culture structure/agency and self/other from the perspective of rural studies. However, it is the 'cultural turn' in wider social science which has lent both respectability and excitement to the nexus with rurality, particularly with new foci on landscape, otherness and the spatiality of nature. With a conceptual fascination with difference, and a methodological fascination with [[ethnography]], cultural studies have provided a significant [[palimpsest]]ual overlay onto existing landscapes of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cloke|first=P|title=Country backwater to virtual village? Rural studies and 'the cultural turn'|journal=Journal of Rural Studies|date=October 1998|volume=13|issue=4|pages=367–375|doi=10.1016/s0743-0167(97)00053-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="49668">The [[Cold War]] was reflected in culture through music, movies, books, television and other media, as well as sports and social beliefs and behavior. One major element of the Cold War was the threat of a nuclear war; another was espionage. Many works use the Cold War as a backdrop, or directly take part in fictional conflict between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. The period 1953–62 saw Cold War themes first enter the mainstream culture as a public preoccupation.  For the historical context in America see [[United States in the 1950s]].

==Fiction: spy stories==
[[Cloak and dagger]] stories became part of the popular culture of the Cold War in both East and West, with innumerable novels and movies that showed how polarized and dangerous the world was.&lt;ref&gt;Katy Fletcher, "Evolution of the Modern American Spy Novel." ''Journal of Contemporary History'' 1987 22(2): 319-331. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/260935 in Jstor]&lt;/ref&gt;  Soviet audiences thrilled at spy stories showing how their KGB agents protected the motherland by foiling dirty work by America's nefarious CIA, Britain's devious MI-6, and Israel's devilish Mossad. After 1963, Hollywood increasingly depicted the CIA as clowns (as in the comedy TV series "Get Smart") or villains (as in Oliver Stone's "JFK" (1992).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wesley Alan Britton|title=Beyond Bond: Spies in Fiction and Film|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=82EvCiAG5lEC&amp;pg=PA252|year=2005|publisher=Greenwood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

** Other Tom Clancy novels which are part of the [[Jack Ryan (Tom Clancy character)|Jack Ryan universe]], most especially ''[[The Hunt for Red October]]'' and ''[[The Cardinal of the Kremlin]]'', though all of his books from this era are featured against a background of East-West conflict.
* ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four|1984]]'' by [[George Orwell]]
* [[Frederick Forsyth]]'s spy novels sold in the hundreds of thousands. ''[[The Fourth Protocol]]'', whose title refers to a series of conventions that, if broken, will lead to nuclear war and that are now, of course, all broken except for the fourth and last thread, was made into a [[The Fourth Protocol (film)|major film]] starring British actor [[Michael Caine]]. 
* ''[[The Manchurian Candidate]]'', by Richard Condon, took a different approach and portrayed a Communist conspiracy against the U.S. acting not through leftists or pacifists but through a thinly veiled allusion to [[Joseph McCarthy]]. The logic of this was that if McCarthyists were accusing so many people of being communist agents, it could only be to divert attention from the real communists. The theme of collusion between international communists and Western rightists would be picked up again by many movies (''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'', ''[[A View to a Kill]]'') or television shows (episodes of ''[[MacGyver (1985 TV series)|MacGyver]]'' or ''[[Airwolf]]''), which would feature an alliance between power-hungry communists attacking the free world from the outside and profit-driven capitalists undermining it for financial gain.
* ''Sacrifice'' by [[Graham Masterton]]
* ''[[Masters of Deceit]]''&amp;nbsp;– a non-fiction work written by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], through [[J.

* ''[[The Ugly American]]'' by [[William J. Lederer]] and [[Eugene Burdick]]. Originally published in 1958, this book tells the story of how the U.S government handled foreign policy very poorly. The main character, Homer Atkins, discovers this sad truth when he is dispatched to the fictitious country of Sarkhan (in [[Southeast Asia]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ugly American|last=Lederer|first=William J.|publisher=W.W.

==Cinema==

===Cinema as early Cold War propaganda===
During the Cold War, films functioned as a means to influence and control public opinion internally.  The United States and the Soviet Union invested heavily in propaganda designed to influence the hearts and minds of people around the world, especially using motion pictures.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Shaw and Denise Youngblood, ''Cinematic Cold War: The American and Soviet struggle for hearts and minds'' (University Press Kansas, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  Cold War films produced by both sides attempted to address different facets of the superpower conflict and sought to influence both domestic and foreign opinion. The gap between American and Soviet film gave the Americans a distinct advantage over the Soviet Union; America was readily prepared to utilize their cinematic achievements as a way to effectively impact the public opinion in a way the Soviet Union could not. Cinema, Americans hoped, would help close the gap caused by Soviet development of [[nuclear weapons]] and advancements in space technology.&lt;ref name="Classen"&gt;{{cite web|last=Classen|first=Christoph|title=The Cold War in the Cinema: The Boom in Spy Films in the 1960s, its Causes and Implications|url=http://www.bpb.de/gesellschaft/kultur/filmbildung/63199/the-cold-war-in-the-cinema|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of film as an effective form of widespread propaganda transformed cinema into another Cold War battlefront.

====US cinema====
The Americans took advantage of their pre-existing cinematic advantage over the Soviet Union, using movies as another way to create the Communist enemy. In the early years of the Cold War (between 1948–53), seventy explicitly anti-communist films were released.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Shaw and Denise J. Younglood, ''Cinematic Cold War: The American and Soviet Struggle for Hearts and Minds'' (2010) pp 20-21&lt;/ref&gt;  American films incorporated a wide scale of Cold War themes and issues into all genres of film, which gave American motion pictures a particular lead over Soviet film. Despite the audiences' lack of zeal for Anti-Communist/Cold War related cinema, the films produced evidently did serve as successful propaganda in both America and the USSR. The films released during this time received a response from the Soviet Union, which subsequently released its own array of films to combat the depiction of the Communist threat.

Several organizations played a key role in ensuring that Hollywood acted in the national best interest of the U.S. [[National Legion of Decency|Catholic Legion of Decency]] and the [[Production Code Administration]] acted as two conservative groups that controlled a great deal of the national repertoire during the early stages of the Cold War. These groups filtered out politically subversive or morally questionable movies. More blatantly illustrating the shift from cinema as an art form to cinema as a form of strategic weapon, the [[Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals]] ensured that filmmakers adequately expressed their patriotism. Beyond these cinema-specific efforts, the [[FBI]] played a surprisingly large role in the production of movies, instituting a triangular-shaped film strategy: FBI set up a surveillance operation in Hollywood, made efforts to pinpoint and blacklist Communists, secretly laundered intelligence through [[HUAC]], and further helped in producing movies that "fostered [the FBI] image as the protector of the American people." The FBI additionally endorsed films, including Oscar winner ''[[The Hoaxsters.]]''&lt;ref&gt;Shaw and Younglood, ''Cinematic Cold War'' (2010) pp 20-21&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, Hollywood began using [[spy films]] to create the enemy through film. Previously, the influence of the Cold War could be seen in many, if not all, genres of American film. By the 1960s, spy films were effectively a "weapon of confrontation between the two world systems."&lt;ref name="Classen"/&gt; Both sides heightened paranoia and created a sense of constant unease in viewers through the increased production of spy films. Film depicted the enemy in a way that caused both sides to increase general suspicion of foreign and domestic threat.

====USSR Cold War cinema====
Between 1946–54, the Soviet Union mimicked the US adoption of cinema as a weapon. The Central United Film Studios and the Committee on Cinema Affairs were committed to the Cold War battle. Under [[Stalin]]'s rule, movies could only be made within strict confines. Cinema and government were, as it stood, inextricably linked. Many films were banned for being insufficiently patriotic. Nonetheless, the Soviet Union produced a plethora of movies with the aim to blatantly function as negative propaganda.

In the same fashion as the United States, the Soviets were eager to depict their enemy in the most unflattering light possible. Between 1946 and 1950, 45.6% of on-screen villains in Soviet films were either American or British.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shaw, Youngblood|first=Tony, Denise J.|title=Cinematic Cold War: The American Struggle for Hearts and Minds|year=2010|publisher=University Press of Kansas|location=Kansas|pages=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Films addressed non-Soviet themes that emerged in American film in an attempt to derail the criticism and paint the U.S. as the enemy. Attacks made by the United States against the U.S.S.R were simply used as material by Soviet filmmakers for their own attacks on the US. Soviet cinema during this time took its liberty with history: "Did the [[Red Army]] engage in the mass rapes of German women and pillage German art treasures, factories, and forests? In Soviet cinema, the opposite was true [in ''The Meeting on the Elbe'']."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shaw, Youngblood|first=Tony, Denise J.|title=Cinematic Cold War: The American Struggle for Hearts and Minds|year=2010|publisher=University Press of Kansas|location=Kansas|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; This demonstrated the heightened paranoia of the Soviet Union.

Despite efforts made to elevate the status of cinema, such as changing the Committee of Cinema Affairs to the Ministry of Cinematography, cinema did not seem to work as invigorating propaganda as was planned. Although the Anti-American films were notably popular with audiences, the Ministry did not feel the message had reached the general public, perhaps due to the fact that the majority of moviegoers seeing the films produced were, perhaps, the Soviets most likely to admire American culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shaw, Youngblood|first=Tony, Denise J.|title=Cinematic Cold War: The American Struggle for Hearts and Minds|year=2010|publisher=University Press of Kansas|location=Kansas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Stalin's death, a Main Administration of Cinema Affairs replaced the Ministry, allowing the filmmakers more freedom due to the lack of direct government control. Many of the films released throughout the late 1950s and 1960s focused on spreading a positive image of Soviet life, intent to prove that Soviet life was indeed better than American life.

Russian science fiction emerged from a prolonged period of censorship in 1957, opened up by de-Stalinization and real Soviet achievements in the space race, typified by Ivan Efremov's galactic epic, ''Andromeda'' (1957). Official Communist science fiction transposed the laws of historical materialism to the future, scorning Western nihilistic writings and predicting a peaceful transition to universal communism. Scientocratic visions of the future nevertheless implicitly critiqued the bureaucratically developed socialism of the present. Dissident science fiction writers emerged, such as the Strugatski brothers, Boris and Arkadi, with their "social fantasies," problematizing the role of intervention in the historical process, or Stanislaw Lem's tongue-in-cheek exposures of man's cognitive limitations.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Major, "Future Perfect?: Communist Science Fiction in the Cold War."

===Films depicting a conventional U.S./USSR war===
In addition to fears of a nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union, during the Cold War, there were also fears of a direct, large scale conventional conflict between the two superpowers.
* ''[[Invasion U.S.A. (1952 film)|Invasion U.S.A.]]'' (1952)&amp;nbsp;– The 1952 film showed a Soviet invasion of the U.S.A succeeding because the citizenry had fallen into moral decay, war profiteering, and [[isolationism]]. The film was later parodied on [[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]. (This is not to be confused with the similarly titled Chuck Norris action vehicle released in 1985.)
* ''[[Red Nightmare]]'', a 1962 government-sponsored short subject narrated by [[Jack Webb]], imagined a Soviet-dominated America as a result of the protagonist's negligence of his "all-American" duties.
* ''[[World War III (TV miniseries)|World War III]]'', a 1982 [[National Broadcasting Corporation|NBC]] miniseries about a Soviet invasion of Alaska.
* ''[[Red Dawn]]'' (1984)&amp;nbsp;– presented a conventional Soviet attack with limited, strategic Soviet nuclear strikes on the United States, aided by allies from [[Latin America]], and the exploits of a group of high schoolers who form a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] group to oppose them.
* ''[[Invasion U.S.A. (1985 film)|Invasion U.S.A.]]'' (1985)&amp;nbsp;– This film depicts a Soviet agent leading Latin American Communist guerillas launching attacks in the United States, and an ex-CIA agent played by [[Chuck Norris]] opposing him and his mercenaries.
* ''[[Amerika (TV miniseries)|Amerika]]'' ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], 1987), a peaceful takeover of the [[United States]] by the [[Soviet Union]].

===Films depicting Cold War espionage===
* ''[[Firefox (film)|Firefox]]'' is a 1982 film based on a [[Craig Thomas (author)|Craig Thomas]] [[Firefox (novel)|novel of the same name]]. The plot details an American plot to steal a highly advanced Soviet fighter aircraft ([[Mikoyan MiG-31 (fictional)|MiG-31 Firefox]]) which is capable of Mach 6, is invisible to radar, and carries weapons controlled by thought.
* ''[[The Hunt for Red October (film)|The Hunt for Red October]]'' is a 1990 film based on a [[Tom Clancy]] [[The Hunt for Red October|novel of the same name]] about the captain of a technologically advanced Soviet ballistic missile submarine that attempts to defect to the United States.
* [[James Bond]] first appeared in 1953. While the primary antagonists in the majority of the novels were Soviet agents, the films were only vaguely based on the Cold War. The Bond movies followed the political climate of the time in their depictions of Soviets and [[People's Republic of China|"Red" Chinese]]. In [[Casino Royale (Climax!)|the 1954 version of ''Casino Royale'']], Bond was an American agent working with the British to destroy a ruthless Soviet agent in France, but became more widely known as Agent 007, James Bond, of Her Majesty's Secret Service, who was played by [[Sean Connery]] until 1971 and by several actors since. Although Bond films often used the Cold War as a backdrop, the Soviet Union itself was almost never Bond's enemy, that role being more often left to fictional and apolitical criminal organizations (like the infamous [[SPECTRE]]). However, Red China was in league with Bond's enemies in the films ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'', ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]'' and ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (film)|The Man With the Golden Gun]]'', while some later movies (''[[Octopussy (film)|Octopussy]]'', ''[[The Living Daylights (film)|The Living Daylights]]'') featured a rogue Soviet general as the enemy.
* [[TASS Is Authorized to Declare|TASS Upolnomochen Zayavit...]] ([[Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union|TASS]] is Authorized to Announce ... )&amp;nbsp;– a Soviet TV series based on [[Yulian Semyonov|Julian Semenov's]] novel. The plot of the movie is set around fictional African country '''Nagonia''', where [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agents are preparing a military coup, while KGB agent Slavin is trying to prevent it. Slavin succeeds by blackmailing the corrupt American spy John Glebe.
* [[The Falcon and the Snowman]] is a 1985 film directed by [[John Schlesinger]] about two young American men, [[Christopher Boyce]] and [[Daulton Lee]], who sold U.S. security secrets to the Soviet Union. The film is based upon the 1979 book ''The Falcon and the Snowman: A True Story of Friendship and Espionage'' by [[Robert Lindsey (journalist)|Robert Lindsey]].
* [[Gotcha! (1985 film)|''Gotcha!'' (1985 film)]] is a film about a college student named Jonathan ([[Anthony Edwards]]) who plays a game called Gotcha in which he hunts and is hunted by other students with paint guns on campus.  Jonathan goes to France on vacation, meets a beautiful woman named Sasha ([[Linda Fiorentino]]), travels with her to [[East Germany]], and unknowingly becomes involved in the spy game between the USA and USSR.

===Other films about U.S./Soviet fears and rivalry===

===Television commercials===
[[Wendy's]] Hamburger Chain ran a [[Television advertisement|television commercial]] showing a supposed "Soviet Fashion Show", which featured the same large, unattractive woman wearing the same dowdy outfit in a variety of situations, the only difference being the accessory she carried (for example, a flashlight for 'nightwear' or a beach ball for 'swimwear'). This was supposedly a lampoon on how the Soviet society is characterised with uniformity and standardisation, in contrast to the U.S. characterised with freedom of choice, as highlighted in the Wendy's commercial.

[[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]]'s "[[1984 (television commercial)|1984]]" ad, despite paying homage to George Orwell's novel of the same name, follows a more serious yet ambitious take on the freedom vs. totalitarianism theme evident between the US and Soviet societies at the time.

===Political commercials===

====Daisies and mushroom clouds====
[[File:Commercial-LBJ1964ElectionAdDaisyGirl.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=3|"Daisy" advertisement]]
''[[Daisy (television commercial)|Daisy]]'' was the most famous campaign commercial of the Cold War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/30secondcandidate/timeline/years/1964b.html |title=The :30 Second Candidate: Lyndon Johnson campaign spots |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aired only once, on 7 September 1964, it was a factor in [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s defeat of [[Barry Goldwater]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964 presidential election]]. The contents of the commercial were controversial, and their emotional impact was searing.

The commercial opens with a very young girl standing in a meadow with chirping birds, slowly counting the petals of a [[Bellis perennis|daisy]] as she picks them one by one. Her sweet innocence, along with mistakes in her counting, endear her to the viewer. When she reaches "9", an ominous-sounding male voice is suddenly heard intoning the [[countdown]] of a [[rocket launch]]. As the girl's eyes turn toward something she sees in the sky, the camera [[Zoom lens|zooms]] in until one of her pupils fills the screen, blacking it out. The countdown reaches zero, and the blackness is instantly replaced by a simultaneous bright flash and [[thunder]]ous sound which is then followed by footage of a [[nuclear testing|nuclear explosion]], an explosion similar in appearance to the near [[surface burst]] [[Trinity test]] of 1945, followed by another cut to footage of a billowing [[mushroom cloud]].

As the [[Nuclear weapon yield|fireball]] ascends, an edit cut is made, this time to a close-up section of [[incandescence]] in the mushroom cloud, over which a [[voiceover]] from Johnson is played, which states emphatically, "These are the stakes! To make a world in which all of God's children can live, or to go into the dark. We must either love each other, or we must die." Another voiceover then says, "Vote for President Johnson on November 3. The stakes are too high for you to stay home." (Two months later, Johnson won the election in an [[Landslide victory|electoral landslide]].)

====Bear in the woods====
[[Bear in the woods]] was a [[United States presidential election, 1984|1984]] campaign advertisement endorsing [[Ronald Reagan]] for [[President of the United States|President]]. This campaign ad depicted a brown bear wandering through the woods (likely implying the Soviet Union) and suggested that Reagan was more capable of dealing with the Soviets than his opponent, in spite of the fact that the ad never explicitly mentioned the Soviet Union, the Cold War or [[Walter Mondale]].

==Humor==
{{See also|Kitchen debate|Russian jokes|The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming}}
The 1984 "[[We begin bombing in five minutes]]" incident is an example of cold war [[dark humor]]. It was a personal [[microphone gaffe]] joke between Ronald Reagan, his White House staff and radio technicians that was accidentally leaked to the US populace. At the time, Reagan was well known before this incident for telling Soviet/[[Russian jokes]] in televised debates, many of which have now been uploaded to video hosting websites.
{{Listen

}}
:''My fellow Americans, I'm pleased to tell you today that I've signed legislation that will outlaw [[Soviet Union|Russia]] forever. We begin bombing in five minutes.''

The joke was a parody of the opening line of that day's speech:

:''My fellow Americans, I'm pleased to tell you that today I signed legislation that will allow student religious groups to begin enjoying a right they've too long been denied&amp;mdash;the freedom to meet in public high schools during nonschool hours, just as other student groups are allowed to do.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1984/81184a.htm Radio Address to the Nation on Congressional Inaction on Proposed Legislation]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his trip to [[Los Angeles]] in 1959 and being refused entry into [[Disneyland]], on security grounds, a dejected Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] joked, "...just now I was told that I could not go to Disneyland, I asked "Why not?" What is it, do you have rocket launching pads there?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/disney/parks/nikita.asp |title=Nikita Khrushchev at Disneyland |publisher=snopes.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arts==
{{See also|The CIA and the Cultural Cold War}}
The United States and the Soviet Union engaged in competition vis-à-vis the arts. Cultural competition played out in Moscow, New York, London, and Paris.  The Soviets excelled at [[ballet]] and [[chess]], the Americans at [[jazz]] and [[abstract expressionism|abstract expressionist]] paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Serge Guilbaut, ''How New York Stole the Idea of Modern Art: Abstract Expressionism, Freedom, and the Cold War'' (U. of Chicago Press, 1983).&lt;/ref&gt; The US funded its own ballet troupes, and both used ballet as political propaganda, using dance to reflect life style in the "battle for the hearts and minds of men."  The defection of a premier dancer became a major coup.&lt;ref&gt;David Caute, ''The Dancer Defects: The Struggle for Cultural Supremacy during the Cold War'' (Oxford University Press, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1956 through the late 1970s, the U.S. State Department sent its finest jazz musicians to show off music that appealed to youth, to demonstrate racial harmony at home, and to undergird freedom as jazz was a democratic music form, free flowing and improvised. Jazz tours of the Soviet Union were organized in 1956, and lasted through the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Penny Von Eschen, ''Satchmo blows up the world: Jazz ambassadors play the cold war'' (Harvard University Press, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lisa E. Davenport, ''Jazz diplomacy: Promoting America in the cold war era'' (U. Press of Mississippi, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

Chess was inexpensive enough—and the Russians always won until America unleashed [[Bobby Fischer]].&lt;ref&gt;Caute,  ''The Dancer Defects: The Struggle for Cultural Supremacy During the Cold War '' pp 611-613&lt;/ref&gt;  Vastly more expensive was the [[Space Race]], as a proxy for scientific supremacy (with a technology with obvious military uses).&lt;ref&gt;Walter A. McDougall, "Sputnik, the Space Race, and the Cold-War." ''Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists'' (1985):41#5  20-25.&lt;/ref&gt;  As well when it came to sports the two countries both competed in the Olympics during the Cold War period which also created severe tension when the West [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|boycotted the first Russian Olympics in 1980]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Wagg, and David L. Andrews, eds. ''East plays west: Sport and the Cold War'' (Routledge, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==

===1950s and 1960s===
{{See also|The CIA and the Cultural Cold War}}
Musicians of these decades, especially in [[Jazz]] and [[Folk Music]], were influenced by the shadow of nuclear war. Probably the most famous, passionate and influential of all was [[Bob Dylan]], notably in his songs [[Masters of War]] and [[A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall]] (written just before the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]). In 1965 [[Barry McGuire]]'s version of [[P. F. Sloan]]'s apocalyptic [[Eve of Destruction (song)|Eve of Destruction]] was a number one hit in the United States and elsewhere.

[[Van Cliburn]] was a pianist who was celebrated with a [[ticker tape parade]] after winning a musical competition in the Soviet Union.

===Later===
Many protest songs during the 1980s reflected general unease with escalating tensions between the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]] brought on by [[Ronald Reagan]]'s and [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s hard line against the Soviets. For example, various musical artists wore military uniform-like costumes, as a reflection of the increased feeling of militarism seen in the 1980s. Songs symbolically showed the superpowers going to war, as in the [[Frankie Goes to Hollywood]] song "[[Two Tribes]]". This song's MTV music video featured caricatures of United States President [[Ronald Reagan]] and Soviet President [[Konstantin Chernenko]] in a wrestling match.

Other songs expressed fear of World War III, as in the [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] song, "[[Russians (song)|Russians]]", with lyrics such as "I don't subscribe to his [Reagan's or Khrushchev's] point of view" (that Reagan would protect Europe, or that [[Nikita Khrushchev|Khrushchev]] would "bury" the West). Other examples include [[Sly Fox (musical group)|Sly Fox]]'s "Let's go all the way", a song about "going all the way" to nuclear war; [[The Escape Club]]'s "Wild Wild West" with its various references to the Cold War. The [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] song "[[Land of Confusion]]" expressed a desire to make some sense out of the world, especially in relation to nuclear war.

A number of punk rock bands from the 1980s attacked Cold War era politics, such as Reagan's and Thatcher's [[Mutual assured destruction|nuclear deterrence]] [[Brinkmanship (Cold War)|brinkmanship]]. A small sampling includes [[The Clash]], [[Dead Kennedys]], [[Government Issue]], [[Fear (band)|Fear]], [[Suicidal Tendencies]], [[Toxic Reasons]], [[Reagan Youth]], etc. Noted punk compilation ''[[International P.E.A.C.E. Benefit Compilation|P.E.A.C.E.]]'' included bands from around the world in an attempt to promote international peace. The [[Scars (band)|Scars]] covered apocalyptic poem "Your Attention Please" by [[Peter Porter (poet)|Peter Porter]], a radio broadcast announcing nuclear war.

Probably the most famous of the 1980s songs against increased confrontation between the Soviets and the Americans was [[Nena]]'s "[[99 Luftballons]]", which described the events - ostensibly starting with the innocent release of 99 (red) toy balloons - that could lead to a nuclear war.

[[Imperiet]]&amp;nbsp;– "[[Coca Cola Cowboys]]"&amp;nbsp;– a Swedish rock song about how the world is divided by two super powers that both claim to represent justice.

[[Roman Palester]], a classical music composer had his works banned and censored in Poland and the Soviet Union, as a result of his work for [[Radio Free Europe]], even though he was thought to be Poland's greatest living composer at the time.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.culture.pl/en/culture/artykuly/os_palester_roman Profiles: Roman Palester]". Adam Mickiewicz Institute. Retrieved on 12 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Musicals and plays===
*''[[Chess (musical)|Chess]]'' The game of chess was another mode of competition between the two [[superpower]]s, which the musical demonstrates.

==Consumerism==
Historians debate whether the spread of American-style consumerism to Western Europe (and Japan) was part of the Cold War. Steigerwald reviews the debate by looking at the book ''Trams or Tailfins? Public and Private Prosperity in Postwar West Germany and the United States'' (2012) by Jan L. Logemann:
:In arguing that West Germany was not "Americanized" after the war, Logemann joins a long debate about American consumer capitalism's power, sweep, and depth of influence in the developed world through the second half of the twentieth century. In pointed contrast to Reinhold Wagnleitner's ''Coca-colonization and the Cold War'' (1994) and Victoria de Grazia's ''Irresistible Empire'' (2005), Logemann argues that, for all the noisy commentary, pro and con, about postwar Americanization, West Germans shaped their version of the affluent society according to deeply held and distinctly un-American values. Rather than a sweeping homogenization of the developed world, postwar affluence ran along "different paths to consumer modernity"....Instead of the "consumer-as-citizen" (whom Lizabeth Cohen, in ''The Consumer's Republic'' [2003], defined as the main social type in postwar America), West Germans promoted the social consumer who practiced "public consumption," which Logemann defines as "the provision of publicly funded alternatives to private consumer goods and services in areas ranging from housing to transportation or entertainment" (p. 5).&lt;ref&gt;David Steigerwald's review of Jan L. Logemann. ''Trams or Tailfins? Public and Private Prosperity in Postwar West Germany and the United States'' (2012) in ''Reviews in American History'' (March 2014) [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/reviews_in_american_history/v042/42.1.steigerwald.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17747">The term '''culture industry''' ({{lang-de|Kulturindustrie}}) was coined by the [[critical theory|critical theorists]] [[Theodor Adorno]] (1903–1969) and [[Max Horkheimer]] (1895–1973), and was presented as critical vocabulary in the chapter "The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception", of the book ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]'' (1944), wherein they proposed that [[popular culture]] is akin to a factory producing standardized cultural goods—[[film]]s, [[radio]] programmes, [[magazine]]s, etc.—that are used to manipulate [[mass society]] into passivity.&lt;ref name="ADOR" /&gt; Consumption of the easy pleasures of popular culture, made available by the [[Mass media|mass communications media]], renders people docile and content, no matter how difficult their [[economic]] circumstances.&lt;ref name="ADOR"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Horkheimer|first1=Max|last2=Adorno|first2=Theodor W.|last3=Ed. by Gunzelin Schmid Noerr.

In contrast, true psychological needs are [[free will|freedom]], [[creativity]], and genuine [[happiness]], which refer to an earlier demarcation of human needs, established by [[Herbert Marcuse]]. (See ''[[Eros and Civilization]]'', 1955).&lt;ref name="MARC"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marcuse|first1=Herbert|title=Eros and civilization : a philosophical inquiry into Freud|date=1966|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|isbn=978-0807015544|edition=4. pr.|url=http://freudians.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Marcuse-Eros-and-Civilization-Part-II-Beyond-the-Reality-Principle.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Frankfurt School==
{{Frankfurt School}}
Members of The Frankfurt School were much influenced by the [[dialectical materialism]] and [[historical materialism]] of [[Karl Marx]], as well as the revisitation of the dialectical [[idealism]] of [[Hegel]]; both events are studied not in isolation, but as part of the process of change. As a group later joined by [[Jürgen Habermas]], they were responsible for the formulation of [[critical theory]]. In works such as ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]'' and ''[[Negative Dialectics]]'', Adorno and Horkheimer theorized that the phenomenon of [[mass culture]] has a political implication, namely that all the many forms of popular culture are parts of a single ''culture industry'' whose purpose is to ensure the continued obedience of the ''masses'' to market interests.

==The theory==
The essay is concerned with the production of cultural content in capitalist societies. It critiques the supply-driven nature of cultural economies as well as the apparently inferior products of the system.&lt;ref name=Durham2003p66&gt;Durham (2003) p.66&lt;/ref&gt; Horkheimer and Adorno argue that mass-produced entertainment aims, by its very nature, to appeal to vast audiences and therefore both the intellectual stimulation of high art and the basic release of low art.&lt;ref&gt;Durham (2003) p.68&lt;/ref&gt; The essay does not suggest that all products of this system are inherently inferior, simply that they have replaced other forms of entertainment without properly fulfilling the important roles played by the now defunct sources of culture.&lt;ref&gt;Durham (2003) p.70&lt;/ref&gt;

Horkheimer and Adorno make consistent comparisons between [[Fascist Germany]] and the American film industry. They highlight the presence of mass-produced culture, created and disseminated by exclusive institutions and consumed by a passive, homogenised audience in both systems.&lt;ref&gt;Durham (2003) p.71&lt;/ref&gt; This illustrates the logic of domination in post-enlightenment modern society, by monopoly capitalism or the nation state.&lt;ref&gt;Scannell (2007) p.45&lt;/ref&gt; Horkheimer and Adorno draw attention to the problems associated with a system that 'integrates its consumers from above', arguing that in attempting to realise enlightenment values of reason and order, the holistic power of the individual is undermined.&lt;ref&gt;Scannell (2007) p.47&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
Adorno and Horkheimer's work was influenced by both the broader socio-political environment in which it was written and by other major theorists. Written in California in the early 1940s in an era which characterized them as two ethnically Jewish, German émigrés, The Culture Industry is influenced by European politics and the war by which the continent was consumed.&lt;ref name="Scannell"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scannell|first1=Paddy|title=Media and communication|date=2007|publisher=SAGE Publ.|location=Los Angeles [u.a.]|isbn=9781412902687|page=37|edition=Repr.|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=-LfZAAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=jewish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, the American film industry was characterised by an unprecedented level of studio monopolisation,&lt;ref name=Durham2003p66 /&gt; it was "Hollywood at its most classical, American mass culture at its most Fordist".&lt;ref&gt;Hansen (1992) p.46&lt;/ref&gt;

Horkheimer and Adorno were influenced heavily by major developers of social, political and economic theory,&lt;ref&gt;Scannell (2007) pp.37–44&lt;/ref&gt; most notably:

* [[Karl Marx]]'s theories of alienation and commodity fetishism,
* [[Max Weber]]'s instrumental reason, and 
* [[Georg Lukacs]]' concept of the reification of consciousness.

==Elements==
{{Original research|section|discuss=Talk:Culture_industry#Original_research.3F|date=January 2017}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2017}} 
Anything made by a person is a materialization of their labour and an expression of their intentions. There will also be a use value: the benefit to the consumer will be derived from its utility. The exchange value will reflect its utility and the conditions of the market: the prices paid by the television broadcaster or at the box office. Yet, the modern [[soap opera]]s with their interchangeable plots and formulaic narrative conventions reflect standardized production techniques and the falling value of a mass-produced cultural product. Only rarely is a film released that makes a more positive impression on the general discourse and achieves a higher exchange value, e.g. ''[[Patton (film)|Patton]]'' (1970), starring [[George C. Scott]] as the eponymous American general, was released at a time of considerable anti-war sentiment. The opening shot is of Patton in front of an American flag making an impassioned speech. This was a form of [[dialectic]] in which the audience could identify with the patriotism either sincerely (the thesis) or ironically (the antithesis) and so set the tone of the interpretation for the remainder of the film. However, the film is manipulating specific historical events, not only as entertainment, but also as a form of propaganda by demonstrating a link between success in strategic resource management situations and specified leadership qualities. Given that the subtext was instrumental and not "value free", ethical and philosophical considerations arise.

Normally, only high art criticizes the world outside its boundaries, but access to this form of communication is limited to the elite classes where the risks of introducing social instability are slight. A film like ''Patton'' is popular art which intends controversy in a world of social order and unity which, according to Adorno, is regressing into a cultural blandness. To Hegel, order is good ''a priori'', i.e. it does not have to answer to those living under it. But, if order is disturbed? In ''Negative Dialectics'', Adorno believed this tended towards progress by stimulating the possibility of class conflict. Marx's theory of Historical Materialism was [[Teleology|teleological]], i.e. society follows through a dialectic of unfolding stages from ancient modes of production to feudalism to capitalism to a future communism. But Adorno felt that the culture industry would never permit a sufficient core of challenging material to emerge on to the market that might disturb the ''[[status quo]]'' and stimulate the final communist state to emerge.

==Mass culture==
A central point of the ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]'' is the topic of "the Enlightenment as the deception of the masses". The term "culture industry" is intended to refer to the commercial marketing of culture, the branch of industry that deals specifically with the production of culture that is in contrast to "authentic culture".

Horkheimer and Adorno contend that industrially produced culture robs people of their imagination and takes over their thinking for them. The culture industry delivers the "goods" so that the people then only have left the task of consuming them. Through mass production, everything becomes homogenized and whatever diversity remains is constituted of small trivialities. Everything becomes compressed through a process of the imposition of schemas under the premise that what's best is to mirror physical reality as closely as possible. Psychological drives become stoked to the point where [[Sublimation (psychology)|sublimation]] is no longer possible.

Movies serve as an example. "All films have become similar in their basic form. They are shaped to reflect facts of reality as closely as possible. Even fantasy films, which claim to not reflect such reality, don't really live up to what they claim to be. No matter how unusual they strive to be, the endings are usually easy to predict because of the existence of prior films which followed the same schemas. Also, for example, erotic depictions become so strong and so pronounced that a transformation to other forms is no longer possible."&lt;ref&gt;The Dialectic of Enlightenment&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The aims of the culture industry are—as in every industry—economic in nature. All endeavors become focused on economic success.

Authentic culture, however, is not goal-oriented, but is an end in itself. Authentic culture fosters the capacity of human imagination by presenting suggestions and possibilities, but in a different way than the culture industry does since it leaves room for independent thought. Authentic culture does not become channeled into regurgitating reality but goes levels beyond such. Authentic culture is unique and cannot be forced into any pre-formed schemas.

As for discovering the causes of the development of the culture industry, Horkheimer and Adorno contend that it arises from companies' pursuit of the maximization of profit, in the economic sense. However, this cannot be said to be culture, or what culture is supposed to be. It can only be described as being a form of commerce, just like any other kind of commerce.

The culture industry argument is often assumed to be fundamentally pessimistic in nature because its purveyors seem to condemn "mass media" and their consumers. 
However, for Adorno, the term "culture industry" does not refer to "mass culture", or the culture of the masses of people in terms of something being produced by the masses and conveying the representations of the masses. On the contrary, such involvement of the masses is only apparent, or a type of seeming democratic participation. Adorno contends that what is actually occurring is a type of "defrauding of the masses". Horkheimer and Adorno deliberately chose the term "culture industry" instead of "mass culture" or "mass media".&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Behrens, Roger: ''Kritische Theorie''. Hamburg: Europäische Verlagsanstalt 2002, page 68.&lt;/ref&gt; "The culture industry perpetually cheats its consumers of what it perpetually promises."&lt;ref name="Horkheimer, Max 2006, page 145"&gt;Horkheimer, Max; Adorno, Theodor W.: ''Dialektik der Aufklärung. Philosophische Fragmente''. Frankfurt am Main: Fischer Verlag 16th edition 2006, page 145.&lt;/ref&gt; The culture industry even encroaches upon the small distractions of leisure activity: "Amusement has become an extension of labor under late capitalism."&lt;ref name="Horkheimer, Max 2006, page 145" /&gt; Horkheimer and Adorno, above all, in their critical analyses, delve into what they call "the fraying of art" and the "de-artification of art", and discuss how the arts are defused by the culture industry. Works of art have become commodified: Beethoven, Mozart and Wagner are only used in fragmentary forms when included in advertisement. According to Critical Theory, "selling out" is not the decisive factor involved, but rather it's the manner in which art is commodified and how art and culture are changed that is the crucial issue.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Behrens, Roger: ''Kritische Theorie''. Hamburg: Europäische Verlagsanstalt 2002, page 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Culture today is infecting everything with sameness."&lt;ref&gt;Horkheimer, Max; Adorno, Theodor W.: ''Dialektik der Aufklärung. Philosophische Fragmente''. Frankfurt am Main: Fischer Verlag 16th edition 2006, page 129.&lt;/ref&gt; For Adorno and Horkheimer, subversion has become no longer possible.

==Observations==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2012}}
Wiggershaus Rolf say that the products of [[mass culture]] would not be popular if people did not enjoy them, and that culture is self-determining in its administration. This would deny Adorno contemporary political significance, arguing that politics in a prosperous society is more concerned with action than with thought. He also notes that the young generation of critical theorists largely ignore Adorno's work which, in part, stems from Adorno's inability to draw practical conclusions from his theories. For instance, Wiggershaus states: "The other side of Adorno's apparently paradoxical definition was ignored: that only rational objectivity was still possible for the modern work of art was only possible, in any significant sense, as a product of subjectivity"&lt;ref name="Wiggershaus"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rolf|first1=Wiggershaus|last2=translated by: Michael|first2=Robertson|title=The Frankfurt School : its history, theories, and political significance|date=1995|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0262731133|pages=513|edition=1st MIT Press pbk.|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=vZMjjW4uOWIC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR8&amp;dq=The+Frankfurt+School+:+its+history,+theories,+and+political+significance&amp;ots=YIoZkLlBfC&amp;sig=hFjxWnRNLmkF2eMqJR48BpcpUiY#v=onepage&amp;q=Adorno%20thought%20art%20had%20lost%20its%20way%20and%20changed%20into%20ideology.&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adorno is also accused of a lack of consistency in his claims to be implementing Marxism. Whereas he accepted the classical Marxist analysis of society showing how one class exercises domination over another, he deviated from Marx in his failure to use dialectic as a method to propose ways to change. Marx's theory depended on the willingness of the working class to overthrow the ruling class, but Adorno and Horkheimer postulated that the culture industry has undermined the revolutionary movement. 
Adorno's idea that the mass of the people are only objects of the culture industry is linked to his feeling that the time when the working class could be the tool of overthrowing capitalism is over. 
Other critics note that "High culture" too is not exempt from a role in the justification of capitalism. The establishment and reinforcement of [[elitism]] is seen by these critics as a key element in the role of such genres as [[opera]] and [[ballet]].

'''Culture theory''' is the branch of comparative [[anthropology]] and [[semiotics]] (not to be confused with [[cultural sociology]] or [[cultural studies]]) that seeks to define the [[heuristic]] concept of [[culture]] in [[operationalism|operational]] and/or [[scientific method|scientific]] terms.

==Overview==
In the 19th century, "[[culture]]" was used by some to refer to a wide array of [[human]] activities, and by some others as a synonym for "[[civilization]]".  In the 20th century, [[Anthropology|anthropologists]] began theorizing about culture as an object of scientific analysis.  Some used it to distinguish human [[Adaptation (biology)|adaptive strategies]] from the largely [[instinct]]ive adaptive strategies of [[animal]]s, including the adaptive strategies of other [[primate]]s and non-human [[Hominidae|hominid]]s, whereas others used it to refer to symbolic [[representation (arts)|representations]] and expressions of human experience, with no direct adaptive value.  Both groups understood culture as being definitive of [[human nature]].

According to many [[theory|theories]] that have gained wide acceptance among anthropologists, culture exhibits the way that humans interpret their [[biology]] and their [[social environment|environment]]. According to this point of view, culture becomes such an integral part of human [[existentialism|existence]] that it ''is'' the human environment, and most cultural [[Social change|change]] can be attributed to human adaptation to [[history|historical events]].  Moreover, given that culture is seen as the primary adaptive mechanism of humans and takes place much faster than [[human evolution|human biological evolution]], most cultural change can be viewed as culture adapting to itself.

Although most anthropologists try to define culture in such a way that it separates human beings from other animals, many human traits are similar to those of other animals, particularly the traits of other primates.  For example, [[chimpanzee]]s have big [[brain]]s, but human brains are bigger.  Similarly, [[bonobo]]s exhibit complex [[non-human animal sexuality|sexual behaviour]], but human beings exhibit much more complex [[human sexuality|sexual behaviours]].  As such, anthropologists often debate whether [[human behaviour]] is different from [[ethology|animal behaviour]] in degree rather than in kind; they must also find ways to distinguish cultural behaviour from sociological behaviour and [[psychological]] behavior.

Acceleration and amplification of these various aspects of culture change have been explored by complexity economist, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110123150543/http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~wbarthur/Papers/Papers.html W. Brian Arthur]. In his book, ''The Nature of Technology'', Arthur attempts to articulate a [[theory of change]] that considers that existing technologies (or material culture) are combined in unique ways that lead to novel new technologies. Behind that novel combination is a purposeful effort arising in human motivation. This articulation would suggest that we are just beginning to understand what might be required for a more robust theory of culture and culture change, one that brings coherence across many disciplines and reflects an integrating elegance.

Deliberate destruction and theft of cultural heritage has been conducted by the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] since 2014 in [[Iraq]], [[Syria]], and to a lesser extent in [[Libya]]. The destruction targets various places of worship under ISIL control and ancient historical artifacts. In Iraq, between the [[fall of Mosul]] in June 2014 and February 2015, ISIL had plundered and destroyed at least 28 historical religious buildings.&lt;ref name="al-shorfa"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mawtani.al-shorfa.com/en_GB/articles/iii/features/2015/02/13/feature-01 |title=Iraq churches, mosques under ISIS attack |author=Khalid al-Taie |publisher=mawtani.al-shorfa.com |date=13 February 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219092526/http://mawtani.al-shorfa.com/en_GB/articles/iii/features/2015/02/13/feature-01 |archivedate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Valuable items from some buildings were looted in order to smuggle and sell them to finance ISIS activities.&lt;ref name="al-shorfa"/&gt;

ISIL uses a unit called the ''Kata'ib Taswiyya'' (settlement battalions) to select targets for demolition.&lt;ref name="gi"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/4973/destruction-middle-east-antiquities |title=The Destruction of the Middle East |author=Denis MacEoin |publisher=[[Gatestone Institute]] |date=27 December 2014 |accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNESCO]] Director-General [[Irina Bokova]] branded the ISIS activities in this respect as "a form of [[cultural cleansing]]"&lt;ref name="gi"/&gt; and launched the [[Unite4Heritage]] campaign to protect heritage sites threatened by extremists.

==Motivation==
{{See also|Aniconism in Islam}}
ISIL justifies the destruction of cultural heritage sites with its extreme following of [[Salafism]] which, according to its followers, places "great importance on establishing [[tawhid]] (monotheism)", and "eliminating [[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]] (polytheism)." While it is often assumed that the group's actions are mindless acts of vandalism, there is an ideological underpinning to the destruction. ISIL views its actions in sites like Palmyra and Nimrud as being in accordance with Sunni [[Islam]]ic tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tonyblairfaithfoundation.org/religion-geopolitics/commentaries/glance/dont-be-surprised-isis-destroying-history |title=Don't Be Surprised by ISIS Destroying History |publisher=Tony Blair Faith Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond the ideological aspects of the destruction, there are other, more practical, reasons behind ISIL's destruction of historic sites. Grabbing the world's attention is easily done through the destruction of such sites, given the extensive media coverage and international condemnation that comes afterwards. Destroying historic ruins also allows ISIL to wipe the slate clean and to start afresh, leaving no traces of any previous culture or civilization, while also providing an ideal platform for the group to establish its own identity and leave its mark on history. Despite the images showing extreme destruction, ISIL has also been making use of the looted antiquities to finance their activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/15/iraq-isis-arrest-jihadists-wealth-power |title=How an arrest in Iraq revealed Isis's $2bn jihadist network |author=Martin Chulov |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the UN's ban on the trade of artifacts looted from Syria since 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/02/12/us-mideast-crisis-un-idUSKBN0LG1YN20150212 |title=U.N.

In 2014, media reported destruction of multiple, chiefly [[Shiite]], mosques and shrines throughout Iraq by ISIL.&lt;ref name="hp"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/07/isis-destroys-shiite-mosque_n_5564373.html |title=ISIS Destroys Shiite Mosques And Shrines In Iraq, Dangerously Fracturing Country (PHOTOS) |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=7 July 2014 |accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among them were Al-Qubba Husseiniya Mosque in [[Mosul]], Jawad Husseiniya Mosque and Saad bin Aqeel Husseiniya Shrine in [[Tal Afar]], [[Sunni]] Ahmed al-Rifai Shrine and tomb in Mahlabiya District and the so-called Tomb of the Girl (Qabr al-Bint) in Mosul.&lt;ref name="hp"/&gt; The Tomb of the Girl, reputed to honour a girl who died of a broken heart, was actually believed to be the tomb of medieval scholar [[Ali ibn al-Athir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/world/isis-insurgents-wage-war-on-history/article6158435.ece |title=ISIS insurgents wage war on history |work=[[The Hindu]] |author=Praveen Swami |date=29 June 2014 |accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, ISIL bulldozed the shrine of [[Fathi al-Ka'en]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2014/06/25/368591/isil-destroys-two-shia-sites-in-mosul |title=ISIL destroys two Shia religious sites in Iraqi city of Mosul |publisher=PressTV |date=25 June 2014 |accessdate=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Mosul, ISIL also targeted several tombs with shrines built over them. In July 2014, ISIL destroyed [[Tomb of Daniel#Iraq|one of the tombs of prophet Daniel]] (located in [[Mosul]]) by planted explosives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/25/isis-jonah-tomb_n_5620520.html |title=ISIS Destroys Jonah's Tomb In Mosul, Iraq, As Militant Violence Continues |last=Hafiz |first=Yasmine |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=25 July 2014 |accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 July 2014, the tomb and [[Mosques and shrines of Mosul#The Mosque of the Prophet Yunus (Jonah)|mosque of the prophet Jonah]] was destroyed with explosives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=ISIL destroys Mosque of Biblical Jonah, Prophet Yunus |url=http://www.iraqinews.com/features/urgent-isil-destroys-mosque-biblical-jonah-prophet-yunus |accessdate=24 July 2014 |work=IraqiNews.com |date=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 July, ISIL destroyed the tomb of Prophet Jirjis (George).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Islamic State destroys ancient Mosul mosque, the third in a week |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/28/islamic-state-destroys-ancient-mosul-mosque |accessdate=27 July 2014 |publisher=theguardian.com |date=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 July 2014, the 13th-century shrine of [[Imam Awn al-Din]] in Mosul, one of the few structures to have survived the [[Mongol invasions and conquests#West Asia|13th-century Mongol invasion]], was destroyed by ISIL.&lt;ref name="gi"/&gt; The destruction was mostly carried out  with explosive devices, but in some cases bulldozers were used.&lt;ref name="hp"/&gt;

In March 2015, ISIL reportedly bulldozed to the ground the Hamou al-Qadu Mosque in Mosul, dating back to 1880.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sputniknews.com/middleeast/20150308/1019218229.html |title=ISIL Destroys Another Mosque in Iraq |publisher=[[Sputnik (news agency)|Sputnik]] |date=8 March 2015 |accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year ISIL ordered the removal of all decorative elements and frescoes from mosques in Mosul, even those containing [[Quranic]] verses that mention Allah.&lt;ref name="tass"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tass.ru/mezhdunarodnaya-panorama/1876232 |title="Исламское государство" заставило имамов Мосула удалять фрески со стен мечетей |publisher=[[Russian News Agency "TASS"]] |language=Russian |date=2 April 2015 |accessdate=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were regarded by ISIL as "an erroneous form of creativity, contradicting the basics of [[sharia]]." At least one [[imam]] in Mosul opposing that order was shot to death.&lt;ref name="tass"/&gt;

ISIL also destroyed [[Sufism|Sufi]] shrines near [[Tripoli]], [[Libya]], in March 2015. The shrines were destroyed by sledgehammers and bulldozers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Thornhill |first1=Ted |title=ISIS continues its desecration of the Middle East: Islamic State reduces Sufi shrines in Libya to rubble in latest act of mindless destruction |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2987800/ISIS-continues-desecration-Middle-East-Islamic-State-reduces-Sufi-shrines-Libya-rubble-latest-act-mindless-destruction.html |accessdate=12 March 2015 |work=Daily Mail |date=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, it was announced that ISIL had blown up the ancient tombs of [[Mohammed bin Ali]] and [[Nizar Abu Bahaaeddine]], located close to the ruins of [[Palmyra]].&lt;ref name="dailymail2015-06-23"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hall |first1=John |title=ISIS begin the destruction of Palmyra: Islamic extremists blow up two mausoleums in the ancient Syrian city... including one belonging to a descendant of the Prophet Mohammed |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3136251/ISIS-begin-destruction-Palmyra-Islamic-extremists-blow-two-mausoleums-ancient-Syrian-city-including-one-belonging-descendant-Prophet-Mohammed.html |accessdate=24 June 2015 |work=[[Daily Mail]] |date=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, ISIL destroyed the [[Minaret of Anah]] located in [[Al Anbar Province]], which dates back to the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid era]]. The minaret was only rebuilt in 2013 after the destruction by the unknown prepetrator in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.almadapaper.net/ar/news/445823/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AD%D8%A9-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A2%D8%AB%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%AA%D9%81%D8%AA%D8%AA%D8%AD-%D9%85%D8%A6%D8%B0%D9%86%D8%A9-%D8%B9%D9%86%D9%87-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%86%D8%A8 السياحة والآثار تفتتح مئذنة "عنه" في الأنبار بعد ترميمها] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180222044731/http://www.almadapaper.net/ar/news/445823/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AD%D8%A9-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A2%D8%AB%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%AA%D9%81%D8%AA%D8%AA%D8%AD-%D9%85%D8%A6%D8%B0%D9%86%D8%A9-%D8%B9%D9%86%D9%87-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%86%D8%A8 |date=2018-02-22 }}.

====Palmyra====
[[File:Temple of Bel, Palmyra 02.jpg|thumb|[[Temple of Bel]] in [[Palmyra]], which was blown up by ISIL in August 2015]]
Following the [[Tadmur offensive (2015)|capture of Palmyra]] in Syria, ISIL was reported as not intending to demolish the city's World Heritage Site (while still intending to destroy any statues deemed '[[Polytheism|polytheistic]]').&lt;ref name="theguardian"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/27/isis-releases-footage-of-palmyra-ruins-intact |title=Syria: Isis releases footage of Palmyra ruins intact and 'will not destroy them' |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 May 2015, ISIL released a 87-second video showing parts of the apparently undamaged ancient [[colonnade]]s, the [[Temple of Bel]] and the [[Roman Theatre at Palmyra|Roman theatre]].&lt;ref name="theguardian"/&gt; On 27 June 2015, however, ISIL demolished the ancient [[Lion of Al-lāt]] statue in Palmyra.

According to the report issued on September 3, 2015 by ASOR Syrian Heritage initiative, ISIL also destroyed seven ancient tower tombs in Palmyra since the end of June over two phases.&lt;ref name="natpost"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/world/intolerable-crime-against-civilization-isil-destroys-three-ancient-tower-tombs-in-palmyra |title=In latest round of destruction, ISIL reduces three ancient tower tombs in Palmyra to rubble |work=[[National Post]] |date=September 4, 2015 |accessdate=September 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last phase of destruction occurred between August 27 and September 2, 2015, including the destruction of the 2nd-century AD [[Tower of Elahbel]], called "the most prominent example of Palmyra's distinct funerary monuments".&lt;ref name="natpost"/&gt; Earlier, the ancient tombs of Iamliku and Atenaten were also destroyed.&lt;ref name="natpost"/&gt; The [[Monumental Arch of Palmyra|Monumental Arch]] was also blown up in October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Shaheen |first1=Kareem |title=Isis blows up Arch of Triumph in 2,000-year-old city of Palmyra |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/05/isis-blows-up-another-monument-in-2000-year-old-city-of-palmyra |accessdate=5 October 2015 |work=The Guardian |date=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hatra====
[[Hatra]] (Arabic: الحضر al-Ḥaḍr) was an ancient city in the Ninawa Governorate and al-Jazira region of Iraq. A large fortified city and capital of the first Arab Kingdom, Hatra withstood invasions by the Romans in A.D. 116 and 198 thanks to its high, thick walls reinforced by towers.&lt;ref name="whc.unesco.org"&gt;http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/277&lt;/ref&gt; However about 240 ce,  the city fell to Shāpūr I (reigned c. 240–272), the ruler of the Persian Sāsānian dynasty, and was destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/place/Hatra&lt;/ref&gt; The remains of the city, especially the temples where Hellenistic and Roman architecture blend with Eastern decorative features, attest to the greatness of its civilization.&lt;ref name="whc.unesco.org"/&gt; The city lies 290&amp;nbsp;km (180&amp;nbsp;mi) northwest of Baghdad and 110&amp;nbsp;km (68&amp;nbsp;mi) southwest of Mosul.

ISIL has burned or stolen collections of books and papers from various locations, including the [[Central Library of Mosul]] (which they rigged with explosives and burned down),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.in/isis-burns-down-mosul-library-destroys-8000-rare-books-manuscripts-624375 |title=Isis Burns Down Mosul Library, Destroys 8,000 Rare Books and Manuscripts |first=Johnlee |last=Varghese |publisher= |accessdate=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the library at the [[University of Mosul]], a Sunni Muslim library, a 265-year-old Latin Church and Monastery of the Dominican Fathers, and the Mosul Museum Library. Some destroyed or stolen works date back to 5000 BC and include "Iraq newspapers dating to the early 20th century, maps and books from the Ottoman Empire, and book collections contributed by about 100 of Mosul’s establishment families."

The general director of the [[National Museum (Prague)|Czech National Museum]], Michal Lukeš, signed an agreement in June 2017 committing the institution to help Syria save, preserve and conserve much of its cultural and historical heritage damaged by war, including the ancient site of Palmyra; he met with Maamoun Abdulkarim and discussed plans for the works that are said to last until 2019.&lt;ref name=czradio&gt;{{cite news |last1=Johnstone |first1=Chris |title=Czechs sign up to help save Syrian cultural heritage |url=http://www.radio.cz/en/section/panorama/czechs-sign-up-to-help-save-syrian-cultural-heritage |accessdate=24 June 2017 |work=Radio Praha |date=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, The World Monuments Fund (WMF) announced launching a £500,000 scheme to train Syrian refugees near the Syrian-Jordanian border in traditional stone masonry.

'''Do-it-yourself biology''' ('''DIY biology''', '''DIY bio''') is a growing [[biotechnology|biotechnological]] [[social movement]] in which individuals, communities, and small organizations study biology and life science using the same methods as traditional research institutions. DIY biology is primarily undertaken by individuals with extensive research training from academia or corporations, who then mentor and oversee other DIY biologists with little or no formal training. This may be done as a [[hobby]], as a [[not-for-profit]] endeavor for community learning and [[open-science]] [[innovation]], or for profit, to start a [[business]].

==History==
The term "biohacking" as well as the concept of do-it-yourself biology has been known as early as 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Forum: Roses are black, violets are green – The emergence of amateur genetic engineers|url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg12516984-100-forum-roses-are-black-violets-are-green-the-emergence-of-amateur-genetic-engineers/|website = New Scientist|accessdate = 2015-10-25|language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = That which is not forbidden is Mandatory|last = Katz|first = J.

Biohacking entered the [[San Francisco]] programmer and [[Maker culture|maker]] communities as early as 2005, through simple demonstrations of basic experiments. As DIYbio experiments became the focus of [[SuperHappyDevHouse]] hackers, the hobby gained additional momentum.

In 2005 Rob Carlson wrote in an article in ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'': "The era of garage biology is upon us. Want to participate?  Take a moment to buy yourself a  lab on [[eBay]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.05/view.html?pg=2?tw=wn_tophead_5 |title=Splice It Yourself: Who needs a geneticist? Build your own  lab. |author=Rob Carlson |journal=Wired |date=May 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He then set up a garage lab the same year, working on a project he had previously worked at the [[Molecular Sciences Institute]] in Berkeley, California.&lt;ref name="nature2010"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Garage : Life hackers |author=Heidi Ledford | journal= Nature |year=2010 |volume=467|issue=7316 |pages=650–2| doi= 10.1038/467650a |pmid = 20930820 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the [[DIYbio (organization)|DIYbio organization]] was founded by Jason Bobe and Mackenzie Cowell and its first meeting held.&lt;ref name="pbs3"&gt;{{cite web|title = PBS News Hour|date = 31 Dec 2008|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IIWH6Hhcnc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[Genspace]] opened the first community biology lab,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = DIY Biotech Hacker Space Opens in NYC|url = https://www.wired.com/2010/12/genspace-diy-science-laboratory/|journal = Wired|accessdate = 2017-07-25|date = 2010-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten months later it was followed by [[BioCurious]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Make|url = http://makezine.com/2011/10/14/biocurious-officially-opens-test-dna-build-equipment-find-a-cofounder-and-more//|website = Make|publisher = Make |accessdate = 2017-07-25|date = 2011-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Victoria Makerspace]]. Many other labs and organizations followed, including but not limited to Counter Culture Labs in Oakland, CA, Baltimore Underground Science Space in Baltimore, MD, TheLab in Los Angeles, CA and Denver Biolabs in Denver, CO.

In 2016, the first conference to focus specifically on biohacking was announced to take place in Sept. in Oakland, CA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Biohack the Planet Conference |url = http://biohacktheplanet.com/ |website = Biohack the Planet|publisher = |accessdate = 2016-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aspects==
The DIYbio movement seeks to revise the notion that one must be an academic with an advanced degree to make any significant contribution to the biology community. It allows large numbers of small organizations and individuals to participate in research and development, with spreading knowledge a higher priority than turning profits.&lt;ref name="econ"&gt;{{cite news|title = Rob Carlson on synthetic biology|url = http://video.economist.com/?fr_story=706e536c2a60f103f23adcc3f0c0c76150dfbe6b|work = The Economist|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111009112915/http://video.economist.com/?fr_story=706e536c2a60f103f23adcc3f0c0c76150dfbe6b|archivedate = 2011-10-09|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The motivations for DIY biology include (but aren't limited to) lowered costs, entertainment, medicine, biohacking, life extension, and education. Recent work combining [[open-source hardware]] of microcontrollers like the [[Arduino]] and [[RepRap]] 3-D printers, very low-cost [[scientific instruments]] have been developed.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, Joshua M. 2012. "[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/337/6100/1303.summary Building Research Equipment with Free, Open-Source Hardware.]" ''Science'' '''337''' (6100): 1303–1304.[https://mtu.academia.edu/JoshuaPearce/Papers/1867941/Open_Source_Research_in_Sustainability open access]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Community laboratory space ===
Many organizations maintain a laboratory akin to a wet-lab [[makerspace]], providing equipment and supplies for members.  Many organizations also run classes and provide training. For a fee (usually between $50 and $100), members can join some spaces and do experiments on their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BUGSS Membership|url = http://www.bugssonline.org/payment.html  |website = BUGSS|publisher = |accessdate = 2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Biocurious Membership|url = http://biocurious.org/join/ |website = Biocurious |publisher = |accessdate = 2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Counter Culture Labs Membership|url = https://counterculturelabs.org/?page_id=136 |website = Counter Culture Labs |publisher = |accessdate = 2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Open source equipment ===
The DIY biology movement attempts to make available the tools and resources necessary for anyone, including non-professionals, to conduct biological engineering. One of the first pieces of [[open source]] laboratory equipment developed was the Dremelfuge by Irish biohacker Cathal Garvey, which uses a 3D printed tube holder attached to a [[Dremel]] [[rotary tool]] to spin tubes at high speeds, replacing often expensive centrifuges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = DremelFuge - A One-Piece Centrifuge for Rotary Tools|url = http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1483 |website = Thingiverse |publisher = |accessdate = 2016-06-17 | date = 2009-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other devices like [[Thermal cycler|PCR machines]] have been recreated extensively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://makezine.com/2011/07/06/dna-is-now-diy-openpcr-ships-worldwide/|work = Make|title =DNA is now DIY|date = 2011-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.lava-amp.com/|work = LavaAmp|title = Pocket PCR for pennies}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Coffee Cup - PCR Thermocycler costing under 350$|url = http://www.instructables.com/id/Coffee-Cup-PCR-Thermocycler-costing-under-350/ |website = Instructables |publisher = |accessdate = 2016-06-17 | date = 2009-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent times, more complex devices have been created such as the OpenDrop digital microfluidics platform&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = OpenDrop|url = http://www.gaudi.ch/OpenDrop/ |website = OpenDrop |publisher = |accessdate = 2016-06-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the DIY NanoDrop&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = DIY NanoDrop|url = http://hackteria.org/wiki/index.php/DIY_NanoDrop |website = DIY NanoDrop |publisher = Hackteria |accessdate = 2016-06-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; both developed by GaudiLabs. Opentrons makes open-source, affordable lab robots, and got its start as a DIY biology collaboration at Genspace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Landoni|first1=Boris|title=Interview to Open Trons {{!}} Open Electronics|url=http://www.open-electronics.org/interview-to-open-trons/|accessdate=1 November 2016|work=Open Source Electronics|date=11 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Advocacy ===
Most advocacy in biohacking is about the safety, accessibility and future legality of experimentation. Todd Kuiken of the [[Woodrow Wilson Center]] proposes that through safety and self-governance, DIY biologists won't be in need of regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Todd Kuiken|title = Governance: Learn from DIY biologists|volume = 531|issue = 7593|pages = 167–168|journal = Nature Magazine|accessdate = 2016-06-19|date = 2016-03-09|url = http://www.nature.com/news/governance-learn-from-diy-biologists-1.19507|doi = 10.1038/531167a|pmid = 26961642}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Josiah Zayner]] has proposed that safety is inherent in biohacking and that accessibility should be the foremost concern as there is large underrepresentation of social and ethnic minorities in biohacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last = Steph Yin|title = Is DIY Kitchen CRISPR A Class Issue?|work = Popular Science |accessdate = 2016-06-19|date = 2016-05-03|url = http://www.popsci.com/is-bringing-crispr-to-kitchens-class-issue}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research topics ==
Many biohacking projects revolve around the modification of life and molecular and genetic engineering.&lt;ref name=Hicks&gt;{{Cite web|last = Jennifer Hicks |title = The Biohacking Hobbyist|work = Forbes|accessdate = 2016-06-19|date = 2014-03-15|url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/jenniferhicks/2014/03/15/move-over-hackers-biohackers-are-here/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bioinformatics ===
[[Bioinformatics]] is another popular target for do-it-yourself biology research. As in other fields, many [[programming language]]s can be used in DIY biology, but most of the languages that are used are those with large [[bioinformatics]] [[library (computing)|libraries]].

Examples include [[BioPerl]] or [[BioPython]], which use the languages [[Perl]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]], respectively.

=== Genetic engineering ===
Genetic Engineers are a subculture of biohackers as one of the most accessible forms of biohacking is through engineering microorganisms or plants. Experiments can range from using plasmids to fluorescent bacteria, controlling gene expression using light in bacteria,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Biocurious Meetup|url = http://www.meetup.com/BioCurious/events/231696709/ |website = Meetup |publisher = Meetup |accessdate = 2016-06-17 | date = 2016-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; even using [[CRISPR]] to engineer the genome of bacteria or yeast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bay Area biologist's gene-editing kit lets do-it-yourselfers play God at the kitchen table|url = http://www.mercurynews.com/science/ci_29372452/bay-area-biologists-gene-editing-kit-lets-do|website = San Jose Mercury News |publisher = San Jose Mercury News |accessdate = 2016-06-17 | date = 2016-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medicine ===
Restricted access to medical care and medicine has pushed biohackers to start experimenting in medically related fields. The Open Insulin project aims to make the recombinant protein [[insulin]] more accessible by creating an open source protocol for expression and purification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = These Biohackers Are Creating Open-Source Insulin|url = http://www.popsci.com/these-biohackers-are-making-open-source-insulin |publisher = Popular Science |accessdate = 2016-06-17 | date = 2015-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other experiments that have involved medical treatments include a whole body [[microbiome]] transplant&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A Bitter Pill|work = The Verge|date = 2016-05-04|url = https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/4/11581994/fmt-fecal-matter-transplant-josiah-zayner-microbiome-ibs-c-diff}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the creation of open source artificial [[pancreas]]es&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tech-savvy Families use homebuilt diabetes device|work = Wall Street Journal|date = 2016-05-09|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/tech-savvy-families-use-home-built-diabetes-device-1462728637}}&lt;/ref&gt; for diabetics.

=== Implants ===
Grinders are a subculture of biohackers that focus on implanting technology&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Biohackers are implanting LEDs under their skin|work = Motherboard|date = 2015-11-09|url = http://motherboard.vice.com/read/biohackers-are-implanting-led-lights-under-their-skin}}&lt;/ref&gt; or introducing chemicals&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = This Biohacker Used Eyedrops To Give Himself Temporary Night Vision|work = Gizmodo|date = 2016-03-27|url = http://io9.gizmodo.com/this-biohacker-used-eyedrops-to-give-himself-temporary-1694016390}}&lt;/ref&gt; into the body to enhance or change their bodies' functionality. 

Some biohackers can now sense which direction they face using a magnetic implant that vibrates against the skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/06/first-humans-sense-where-north-is-cyborg-gadget|title=Meet the first humans to sense where north is|last=Thaddeus-Johns|first=Josie|date=2017-01-06|newspaper=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Art ===
In 2000, controversial and self-described "[[transgenic]] artist" [[Eduardo Kac]] appropriated standard laboratory work by biotechnology and genetics researchers in order to both utilize and critique such scientific techniques. In the only putative work of transgenic art by Kac, the artist claimed to have collaborated with a French laboratory (belonging to the Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique) to procure a green-fluorescent rabbit: a rabbit implanted with a [[green fluorescent protein]] [[gene]] from a type of jellyfish [''Aequorea victoria''] in order for the rabbit to fluoresce green under [[ultraviolet light]]. The claimed work came to be known as the "GFP bunny", and which Kac called ''[[Alba (rabbit)|Alba]]''. This claim by Kac has been disputed by the scientists at the lab who noted that they had performed the exact same experiment (i.e., the insertion of the jellyfish GFP protein-coding gene) on numerous other animals (cats, dogs, etc.) previously and did not create ''Alba'' (known to the researchers only as "Rabbit Number 5256") under the direction of Kac. The laboratory consequently kept possession of the transgenic rabbit which it had created and funded and the "transgenic art" was never exhibited at the Digital Avignon festival [2000] as intended. Kac -- claiming that his rabbit was the first GFP bunny created in the name of Art -- used this dispute to popularize the issue as one of disguised censorship by launching a "Free Alba" campaign. A doctored photo of the artist holding a day-glow-green tinted rabbit appears on his website. &lt;ref&gt;"I Love My Glow Bunny" by Christopher Dickey {copyright 2001 by Christopher Dickey}. First published in ''Wired'' and reprinted in ''Best American Science Writing 2002'' {Editor: Matt Ridley}, HarperCollins''Publishers''&lt;/ref&gt; The members of the [[Critical Art Ensemble]] have written books and staged multimedia performance interventions around this issue, including ''The Flesh Machine'' (focusing on [[in vitro fertilisation]], [[biometrics|surveillance of the body]], and [[liberal eugenics]]) and ''Cult of the New Eve'' (In order to analyze how, in their words, "Science is the institution of authority regarding the production of knowledge, and tends to replace this particular social function of conventional Christianity in the west").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.critical-art.net/CONE.html|title=Critical Art Ensemble|work=critical-art.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Heather Dewey-Hagborg]] is an information artist and biohacker who uses genomic DNA left behind by people as a starting  point for creating lifelike, computer-generated, 3-D portraits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1 = Jenkins|first1 = Mark|title = A 'Cyber' exhibit as timely as the news|work = Washington Post|date = 2013-09-18|page = E18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Krulwich|first1 = Robert|title = Artist plays detective: Can I reconstruct a face from a piece of hair?|url = https://www.npr.org/blogs/krulwich/2013/06/28/196307915/artist-plays-detective-can-i-reconstruct-a-face-from-a-piece-of-hair|website = NPR|accessdate = 7 August 2014|date = 2013-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and concerns==
Biohacking experiences many of the same criticisms as [[synthetic biology]] and [[genetic engineering]] already receive, plus other concerns relating to the distributed and non-institutional nature of the work, involving potential hazards with lack of oversight by professionals or governments. Concerns about biohackers creating pathogens in unmonitored garage laboratories led the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) to begin sending its representatives to DIYbio conferences in 2009.&lt;ref name="nature2010"/&gt;  The arrest and prosecution of some members for their work with harmless [[microbe]]s, such as artivist [[Steve Kurtz]], has been denounced as [[political repression]] by critics who argue the U.S. government has used [[USA PATRIOT Act|post-9/11 anti-terrorism powers]] to intimidate artists and others who use their art to criticize society.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090210231205/http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/news.aspx?id=19246 Scientist pleads guilty to mailing bacteria for 'bio-art']&lt;/ref&gt;

Existing regulations are not specific to this field, so that the possibility of pathological organisms being created and released unintentionally or intentionally by biohackers has become a matter of concern, for example, in the spirit of the re-creation of the 1917 [[flu virus]] by [[Armed Forces Institute of Pathology]] researchers in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Nature|url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v437/n7060/full/437794a.html|title = The 1918 flu virus is resurrected|volume = 437|issue = 7060|doi = 10.1038/437794a|pmid = 16208326|date = October 2005|pages = 794–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the US the [[FBI Weapons of Mass Destruction Directorate]] has worked with the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]'s National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity to convene a series of meetings to discuss biosecurity, which have included discussions of amateur biologists and ways to manage the risks to society it poses.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Zimmer for the New York Times.  March 5, 2012 [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/06/health/amateur-biologists-are-new-fear-in-making-a-mutant-flu-virus.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp; Amateurs Are New Fear in Creating Mutant Virus]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prepared by the American Association for the Advancement of Science in conjunction with the Association of American Universities, Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation [http://www.aau.edu/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=13876 Bridging Science and Security for Biological Research: A Discussion about Dual Use Review and Oversight at Research Institutions Report of a Meeting September 13-14, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8.16}}  At the National Institutes of Health, National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity&lt;ref&gt;[http://osp.od.nih.gov/office-biotechnology-activities/biosecurity/nsabb NSABB Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt; leads efforts to educate the public on "[[Dual-use technology|dual use]] research of concern", for example with websites like "Science Safety Security".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phe.gov/s3/Pages/default.aspx Science Safety Security official website]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011, [[DIYbio]] organized conferences to attempt to create codes of ethics for biohackers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title = The role of codes of conduct in the amateur biology community|url = http://societyofbiologyblog.org/codes-of-conduct-in-the-amateur-biology-community/|accessdate = 4 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pat Mooney, executive director of [[ETC Group (AGETC)|ETC Group]], is a critic of biohacking who argues that&amp;mdash;using a [[laptop]] computer, published [[gene sequence]] information, and mail-order [[synthetic DNA]]&amp;mdash;just about anyone has the potential to construct genes or entire [[genome]]s from scratch (including those of the lethal pathogens) in the near-future.{{Citation needed|date = October 2015}} A 2007 ETC Group report warns that the danger of this development is not just bio-terror, but "bio-error".&lt;ref name="ETC Group 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|author = [[ETC Group (AGETC)|ETC Group]]|title = Extreme Genetic Engineering: An Introduction to Synthetic Biology|date = January 2007|url = http://openwetware.org/images/e/e4/Synbioreportweb.pdf|format = PDF|accessdate = 2012-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While no DIYbio project to date has involved harmful agents,{{Citation needed|date = October 2015}} the fear remains in the minds of both regulators and laypersons. However, it is often pointed out that DIYbio is at too early a stage to consider such advanced projects feasible, as few successful transformative genetics projects have been undertaken yet. It is also worth noting that, while an individual could conceivably do harm with sufficient skill and intent, there exist biology labs throughout the world with greater access to the technology, skill and funding to accomplish a [[Biological warfare|bioweapon]]s project.

While detractors argue that do-it-yourself biologists need some sort of supervision, enthusiasts argue that uniform supervision is impossible and the best way to prevent accidents or malevolence is to encourage a culture of transparency, where, in essence, do-it-yourself biologists would be peer reviewed by other biohackers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Seed Magazine|url = http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/the_biohacking_hobbyist/|title = The Biohacking Hobbyist}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Enthusiasts argue that fear of potential hazards should be met with increased research and education rather than closing the door on the profound positive impacts that distributed biological technology will have on human health, the environment, and the standard of living around the world.&lt;ref name="faq"&gt;{{cite web |title = DIYbio/FAQ|url = http://openwetware.org/wiki/DIYbio/FAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to the lack of precedent regarding such a business model, the DIYbio founders see this as an opportunity to be innovators in regulatory and safety policy.&lt;ref name="pbs3"/&gt;

'''Elegant decay''' is the cultural agreement that some places, and structures, become gradually more elegant, notable, or beautiful as they decay, or fall into [[ruin]], due to their historical, architectural, or cultural significance. Although such reverence is subjective, it is true that certain cities, regions or even countries are more susceptible to the general concept due to past opulence, or their lengthy or enduring history or culture.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

[[File:Rome Palatine Hill.jpg|thumb|360px|The path to the summit of [[Palatine Hill]], [[Rome]], Italy]]

Contrary to the general interpretation that places or structures are more noteworthy in their newness, or older structures hold more value and interest after being historically restored to their original state, the concept of elegant decay is that in the slow degradation of the structures an inherent elegance, or beauty, emerges due to past historic importance. In recent times, this concept has been exploited by those seeking to stimulate tourism.

==History==
[[File:Venice Windows.jpg|thumb|360px|A wall in [[Venice]], Italy, slowly crumbles into a canal.]]

With its rich history, and centuries of past prestige and prominence, [[Western Europe]] has many places where elegant decay is notable and celebrated. One of the most salient is Italy, due to its lengthy historic prominence in prehistoric, ancient, medieval, and modern times. The most celebrated of Italian cities in elegant decay is arguably [[Venice]], largely due to the whole city slowly crumbling and sinking into its lagoon.{{CN|date=October 2017}}

Although Western Europe holds many instances of elegant decay today, the New World also has places of crumbled reverence as well. Most notable in the United States may be the city and region around [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], with its historic fusion of cultures and important contributions to American expansion. In the concept of elegant decay, there sometimes appears to be an element of impending doom to such places and structures, as Venice slowly sinks, and New Orleans is under constant threat from hurricanes.

Elegant decay is different in concept and plan than [[ruin value]], in which structures are planned to look beautiful as ruins from the early planning stages. The concept of elegant decay is related to the concept of [[patina]].

'''Ethnology''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''ἔθνος'', ''ethnos'' meaning "nation"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ethno-|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/ethno-?q=ethno|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the branch of [[anthropology]] that compares and analyzes the characteristics of different [[peoples]] and the relationships between them (cf. [[cultural anthropology|cultural]], [[social anthropology|social]], or [[sociocultural anthropology]]).&lt;ref name=oxford&gt;{{cite web|title=ethnology|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/ethnology?q=ethnology|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific discipline==
{{further information|Ethnicity}}
Compared to [[ethnography]], the study of single groups through direct contact with the culture, ethnology takes the research that ethnographers have compiled and then compares and contrasts different cultures.

[[File:AFKollar 1779.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Adam František Kollár]], 1779]]
The term ''ethnologia'' (''ethnology'') is credited to [[Adam František Kollár|Adam Franz Kollár]] (1718-1783) who used and defined it in his ''Historiae ivrisqve pvblici Regni Vngariae amoenitates'' published in [[Vienna]] in 1783.&lt;ref&gt;Zmago Šmitek and Božidar Jezernik, "The anthropological tradition in Slovenia." In: Han F. Vermeulen and Arturo Alvarez Roldán, eds. ''Fieldwork and Footnotes: Studies in the History of European Anthropology.'' 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; as: “the science of nations and peoples, or, that study of learned men in which they inquire into the origins, languages, customs, and institutions of various nations, and finally into the fatherland and ancient seats, in order to be able better to judge the nations and peoples in their own times.” &lt;ref&gt;Kollár, Adam František  − Historiae jurisque publici regni Ungariae amoenitates, I-II. Vienna., 1783&lt;/ref&gt;

Kollár's interest in linguistic and cultural diversity was aroused by the situation in his native multi-ethnic and multilingual [[History of Hungary|Kingdom of Hungary]] and his roots among its [[Slovak people|Slovaks]], and by the shifts that began to emerge after the gradual retreat of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the more distant [[Balkans#Population composition by nationality and religion|Balkans]].&lt;ref&gt;Gheorghiţă Geană, "Discovering the whole of humankind: the genesis of anthropology through the Hegelian looking-glass." In: Han F. Vermeulen and Arturo Alvarez Roldán, eds. Fieldwork and Footnotes: Studies in the History of European Anthropology.'' 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the goals of ethnology have been the reconstruction of [[human history]], and the formulation of [[culture|cultural]] [[universal (metaphysics)|invariants]], such as the [[incest taboo]] and culture change, and the formulation of generalizations about "[[human nature]]", a concept which has been criticized since the 19th century by various philosophers ([[Hegel]], [[Marx]], [[structuralism]], etc.). In some parts of the world, ethnology has developed along independent paths of investigation and [[Pedagogy|pedagogical]] doctrine, with ''[[cultural anthropology]]'' becoming dominant especially in the [[United States]], and ''[[social anthropology]]'' in [[Great Britain]].  The distinction between the three terms is increasingly blurry. Ethnology has been considered an academic field since the late 18th century, especially in Europe and is sometimes conceived of as any comparative study of human groups.

[[File:Levi-strauss_260.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]]]
The 15th-century exploration of America by European explorers had an important role in formulating new notions of the Occident (the [[Western world]]), such as the notion of the "[[Other (philosophy)|Other]]".  This term was used in conjunction with "savages", which was either seen as a brutal barbarian, or alternatively, as the "[[noble savage]]". Thus, [[civilization]] was opposed in a dualist manner to [[barbary]], a classic opposition constitutive of the even more commonly shared [[ethnocentrism]]. The progress of ethnology, for example with [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]'s [[structural anthropology]], led to the criticism of conceptions of a linear [[progress (history)|progress]], or the pseudo-opposition between "societies with histories" and "societies without histories", judged too dependent on a limited view of [[history]] as constituted by accumulative growth.

Lévi-Strauss often referred to [[Montaigne]]'s [[Essays (Montaigne)|essay]] on [[cannibalism]] as an early example of ethnology. Lévi-Strauss aimed, through a [[structuralism|structural method]], at discovering universal invariants in human society, chief among which he believed to be the [[incest taboo]]. However, the claims of such cultural [[Universality (philosophy)|universalism]] have been criticized by various 19th- and 20th-century social thinkers, including [[Marx]], [[Nietzsche]], [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], [[Derrida]], [[Althusser]], and [[Deleuze]].

The French school of ethnology was particularly significant for the development of the discipline, since the early 1950s. Important figures in this movement have included Lévi-Strauss, [[Paul Rivet]], [[Marcel Griaule]], [[Germaine Dieterlen]], and [[Jean Rouch]].

'''Falling-out''' is a [[culture-bound syndrome]] primarily reported in the [[southern United States]] and the [[Caribbean]]. It is described as a constricted consciousness as a psychological response to anxiety and specific stressors. Sudden collapse characterizes episodes of falling-out, whether without warning or preceded by dizziness and a spinning sensation. The individual suffering from symptoms of falling out can usually hear and understand what is going on around them.&lt;ref name="American2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=American Psychiatric Association|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition: DSM-IV-TR|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w_HajjMnjxwC&amp;pg=PR34|date=1 January 2000|publisher=American Psychiatric Pub|isbn=978-0-89042-665-4|page=900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Falling-out is not treated as an illness unless it becomes disabling. It is often seen as a normal response to stressful situations, funerals, or when a person receives shocking information.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Used colloquially as a [[noun]] or [[adjective]], "'''highbrow'''" is [[synonym]]ous with [[intellectual]]; as an adjective, it also means [[elite]], and generally carries a [[connotation]] of [[high culture]]. The word draws its [[metonymy]] from the [[pseudoscience]] of [[phrenology]], and was originally simply a physical descriptor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hendrickson|first=Robert|title=Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins|publisher=Facts on File|location=New York|year=1997|quote=Dr. [[Franz Joseph Gall]] (1758–1828), founder of the 'science' of phrenology, gave support to the old folk notion that people with big foreheads have more brains. The theory, later discredited, led to the expression 'highbrow' for an intellectual, which is first recorded in 1875.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
"Highbrow" can be applied to [[music]], implying most of the [[European classical music|classical music]] tradition; to literature—i.e., [[literary fiction]] and [[poetry]]; to films in the [[art film|arthouse]] line; and to comedy that requires significant understanding of analogies or references to appreciate. The term ''highbrow'' is considered by some (with corresponding labels as 'middlebrow' 'lowbrow') as discriminatory or overly selective;&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence W. Levine, "Prologue", ''Highbrow/Lowbrow: The Emergence of Cultural Hierarchy in America'', 1990: 3&lt;/ref&gt; and ''highbrow'' is currently distanced from the writer by quotation marks: "We thus focus on the consumption of two generally recognised 'highbrow' genres—opera and classical".&lt;ref&gt;Tak Wing Chan, ''Social Status and Cultural Consumption'' 2010: 60&lt;/ref&gt; The first usage in print of ''highbrow'' was recorded in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|Highbrow}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was popularized in 1902 by Will Irvin, a reporter for ''[[The Sun (New York)|The Sun]]'' who adhered to the phrenological notion of more intelligent people having high foreheads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hendrickson|first=Robert|title=Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins|publisher=Facts on File|location=New York|year=1997|quote=New York Sun reporter Will Irvin popularized 'highbrow,' and its opposite 'lowbrow' in 1902, basing his creation on the wrongful notion that people with high foreheads have bigger brains and are more intelligent and intellectual than those with low foreheads. At first the term was complimentary, but 'Tristi' came to be at best a neutral word.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants==

The opposite of ''highbrow'' is ''[[low culture|lowbrow]]'', and between them is ''[[middlebrow]]'', describing culture that is neither high nor low; as a usage, ''middlebrow'' is derogatory, as in [[Virginia Woolf]]'s unsent letter to the ''[[New Statesman]]'', written in the 1930s and published in ''The Death of the Moth and Other Essays'' (1942). According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', the word ''middlebrow'' first appeared in print in 1925, in ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'': "The [[BBC]] claims to have discovered a new type—'the middlebrow'. It consists of people who are hoping that some day they will get used to the stuff that they ought to like".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Micki McGee, ''Yaddo: Making American Culture'', 106: McGee outlines the history of the highbrow/lowbrow debate.&lt;/ref&gt; The term had previously appeared in hyphenated form in 1912:
{{quotation | [[The Nation]], 25th of January, 1912:
:[T]here is an alarmingly wide chasm, I might almost say a vacuum, between the high-brow, who considers reading either as a trade or as a form of intellectual wrestling, and the low-brow, who is merely seeking for gross thrills. It is to be hoped that culture will soon be democratized through some less conventional system of education, giving rise to a new type that might be called the middle-brow, who will consider books as a source of intellectual enjoyment.
}}

It was popularized by the American writer and poet [[Margaret Widdemer]], whose essay "Message and Middlebrow" appeared in the ''Review of Literature'' in 1933. The three [[genre fiction|genres of fiction]], as American readers approached them in the 1950s and as obscenity law differentially judged them, are the subject of Ruth Pirsig Wood, ''Lolita in Peyton Place: Highbrow, Middlebrow, and Lowbrow Novels'', 1995.

==Cultural examples==
[[Prince Hamlet]] was considered by [[Virginia Woolf]] as a highbrow lacking orientation in the world once he had lost the lowbrow [[Ophelia]] with her grip on earthly realities: this, she thought, explained why in general highbrows "honour so wholeheartedly and depend so completely upon those who are called lowbrows".&lt;ref&gt;A. Fox, ''Virginia Woolf and the Literature of the English Renaissnce'' (1990) p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hypercolor''' was a line of clothing, mainly [[T-shirt]]s and [[shorts]], that changed [[colour]] with heat.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ch3J6mFxBKs Hypercolor TV commercial], youtube.com, last accessed: 1 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

They were manufactured by [[Generra]] Sportswear Company of [[Seattle]] and marketed in the [[United States]] as '''Generra Hypercolor''' or '''Generra Hypergrafix''' and elsewhere as '''Global Hypercolor'''. They contained a [[Thermochromism|thermochromic]] pigment made by [[Matsui Shikiso Chemical]] of [[Japan]], that changed between two colours &amp;ndash; one when cold, one when warm. The shirts were produced with several color change choices beginning in 1991.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/features/lifestyle/la-ig-hypercolor6-2008jul06,0,2927488.story |title=Hypercolor is hot again |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=6 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19910424&amp;slug=1279344 |title=To Dye For – Hypercolor Clothes Heating Up Market For Maker Generra |newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=24 April 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect could easily be permanently damaged, particularly when the clothing was washed in hotter than recommended water, [[ironing|ironed]], [[bleach]]ed, or [[Clothes dryer|tumble-dried]].&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt;

Generra Sportswear Co. had originally been founded as a men's sportswear [[Distribution (business)|distributor]] and [[importer]] in Seattle in 1980. The company was sold to [[Texas]]-based Farah Manufacturing Co. in 1984 and bought back by its founders in 1989. In 1986, the company added childrenswear and womenswear items to their portfolio. They struggled to meet the overwhelming demand for Hypercolor products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-11004669/hyper-demand-hypercolor-generra.html |title=Hyper demand for Hypercolor |magazine=[[Puget Sound Business Journal]] |date=24 June 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between February and May&amp;nbsp;1991 they sold $50&amp;nbsp;million in Hypercolor garments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19920703&amp;slug=1500288 |title=Generra: Hot Start, Then Cold Reality – Company Reflects Industry's Woes |newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=3 July 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generra went [[bankruptcy|bankrupt]] due to mismanagement and fading demand in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/GENERRA+SPORTSWEAR+SEEKS+CHAPTER+11+PROTECTION-a012300680 |title=Generra Sportswear seeks Chapter 11 protection |agency=[[PR Newswire]] |date=2 July 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hypercolor business for the U.S. market was sold to The Seattle T-Shirt Company in 1993; Generra kept the rights for the international market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-13434073.html |title=Generra sells Hypercolor plant to Seattle T-shirt |newspaper=Daily News Record |date=4 February 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19930114&amp;slug=1680021 |title=Generra Sells Hypercolor Plant to New Company |newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=14 January 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company emerged from bankruptcy in 1995 as a licensing business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.allbusiness.com/manufacturing/apparel-other-finished-products-made/4399498-1.html |title=Generra Brand Acquired by Public Clothing |magazine=Bobbin |date=1 June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-18532307/reinventing-generra.html |title=Reinventing Generra |magazine=[[Women's Wear Daily]] |date=31 July 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Generra name was acquired by Public Clothing Co. of New York in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-84730564.html |title=Public Clothing buys Generra trademark |magazine=[[Women's Wear Daily]] |date=29 March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Generra Co. is a contemporary women's and men's apparel brand headquartered in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.style.com/stylefile/2010/02/generras-new-girl/ |title=Generra's new girl |website=style.co |date=1 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://nymag.com/listings/stores/generra/ |title=Generra |website=[[nymag.com]] |access-date=1 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.style.com/stylefile/2010/02/a-portrait-of-the-oceanographer-as-a-young-man/ |title=A Portrait of the Oceanographer as a Young Man? |magazine=[[style.com]] |date=13 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.style.com/fashionshows/complete/F2010MEN-GENERRA?viewall=true |title=Generra runway collections |magazine=[[style.com]] |date=Fall 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 2000s, the technique was revived by a number of apparel brands.&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mslk.com/reactions/hypercolor-is-the-new-old-fashion-trend/ |title=Hypercolor is the new old fashion trend |website=mslk.com |date=7 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://de-de.colourlovers.com/fashion/blog/2008/07/19/super-hyper-awesome-nostalgia-hypercolor |title=Super Hyper Awesome Nostalgia! : Hypercolor |website=colourlovers.com |date=19 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principle==
Substances that can change color due to a change in temperature are called [[thermochromism|thermochromes]]. There are two types of thermochromes: [[liquid crystal]]s (used in [[mood ring]]s) and [[leuco dye]]s (used in Hypercolor T-shirts).

The color change of Hypercolor shirts is based on combination of two colors: the color of the dyed fabric, which remained constant, and the color of the thermochromic dye. Droplets of the thermochromic dye mixture are enclosed in transparent [[microcapsule]]s, a few micrometers in diameter, bound to the fibers of the fabric.

[[Image:Crystal_violet_lactone_reaction.svg|thumb|300px|Transformation between leuco and colored form of crystal violet lactone in response to varying acidity, which is caused by changing temperature]]

The thermochromic droplets are actually a mixture of several chemicals — [[crystal violet lactone]] (the color-changing dye itself), [[benzotriazole]] (a [[weak acid]]), and a [[quaternary ammonium salt]] of a [[fatty acid]] ([[myristylammonium oleate]]) dissolved in [[Dodecanol|1-dodecanol]] as solvent. Together, these lead to a reversible chemical reaction in response to temperature change that produces a change of color.

At low temperatures, the mixture is a solid. The weak acid forms a colored complex with the leuco dye by causing the [[lactone]] ring in the center of the dye molecule to open. At high temperatures, above 24–27&amp;nbsp;°C, the solvent melts and the ammonium salt [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociates]], allowing it to react with the weak acid. This reaction increases the [[pH]], which leads to closing of the lactone ring of the dye to convert it to its colorless (leuco) form.

Therefore, at the low temperature the color of the shirt is the combination of the color of the encapsulated colored dye with the color of the dyed fabric, while at higher temperatures the capsules become colorless and the color of the fabric prevails.

'''Information exchange''' or '''information sharing''' are informal terms that can either refer to bidirectional ''[[information transfer]]'' in [[telecommunication]]s and [[computer science]] or ''[[communication]]'' seen from a [[system theory|system-theoretic]] or [[information-theoretic]] point of view. As "information" in this context invariably refers to ([[Digital data|electronic]]) [[data]] that [[encoder|encodes]] and represents&lt;ref&gt;http://www.csi.ucd.ie/staff/jcarthy/home/Information.html&lt;/ref&gt; the information at hand, a broader treatment can be found under '''[[data exchange]]'''.

The term '''information sharing''' has a long history in [[information technology]]. Traditional information sharing referred to one-to-one exchanges of data between a sender and receiver. These '''information exchange'''s are implemented via dozens of open and proprietary [[network protocol|protocols]], message and file formats. Electronic data interchange ([[Electronic data interchange|EDI]]) is a successful implementation of commercial data exchanges that began in the late 1970s and remains in use today.

Initiatives to standardize information sharing protocols include extensible markup language ([[XML]]), simple object access protocol ([[SOAP]]), and web services description language ([[Web Services Description Language|WSDL]]).

From the point of view of a computer scientist, the four primary information sharing [[design pattern]]s are sharing information [[One-to-one (communication)|one-to-one]], [[Point-to-multipoint communication|one-to-many]], [[many-to-many]], and [[many-to-one]]. Technologies to meet all four of these design patterns are evolving and include [[blog]]s, [[wiki]]s, [[RSS|really simple syndication]], [[Tag (metadata)|tagging]], and [[Online chat|chat]].

One example of United States government's attempt to implement one of these design patterns (one to one) is the [[National Information Exchange Model]] (NIEM).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.niem.gov/ NIEM]&lt;/ref&gt; One-to-one exchange models fall short of supporting all of the required design patterns needed to fully implement data exploitation technology.

Advanced information sharing platforms provide [[controlled vocabularies]], [[data integration|data harmonization]], [[data steward]]ship policies and guidelines, standards for uniform data as they relate to [[privacy]], [[data security|security]], and [[data quality]].

==Information sharing and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act==
The term '''information sharing''' gained popularity as a result of the [[9/11 Commission]] Hearings and its [[9/11 Commission Report|report]] of the [[United States government]]'s lack of response to information known about the planned [[terrorist]] attack on the [[New York City]] [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] prior to the event. The resulting commission report led to the enactment of several executive orders by [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] that mandated agencies implement policies to "share information" across organizational boundaries. In addition, an Information Sharing Environment Program Manager&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ise.gov/ Program Manager for the Information Sharing Environment]&lt;/ref&gt; (PM-ISE) was appointed, tasked to implement the provisions of the [[Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act]] of 2004.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ise.gov/intelligence-reform-and-terrorism-prevention-act-2004-sec-1016-information-sharing&lt;/ref&gt; In making recommendation toward the creation of an "Information Sharing Environment" the 9/11 Commission based itself on the findings and recommendations made by the [[Markle Foundation|Markle]] Task Force on National Security in the Information Age.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.markle.org/national-security/markle-task-force-national-security Markle Task Force on National Security in the Information Age]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Information exchange is also used to describe the process of [[learning]] and the efficiency of the learning.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6690">To '''kick the bucket''' is an [[English language|English]] [[idiom]], considered a [[euphemistic]], informal, or [[slang]] term meaning 'to die'.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Advanced Dictionary of Current English, 4th Ed. (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; Its origin remains unclear, though there have been several theories.

==Origin theories==
A common theory is that the idiom refers to hanging, either as a method of execution or suicide. However, there is no evidence to support this. Its earliest appearance is in the ''[[Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue]]'' (1785), where it is defined as 'to die'.&lt;ref name="phrase"/&gt; In [[John Badcock (writer)|John Badcock]]'s slang dictionary of 1823, the explanation is given that "One Bolsover having hung himself from a beam while standing on a pail, or bucket, kicked this vessel away in order to pry into futurity and it was all UP with him from that moment: ''Finis''".&lt;ref&gt;''Slang: a dictionary of the turf, the ring, the chase, the pit, of bon-ton, and the varieties of life'', London 1823, [https://books.google.com/books?id=MbRMAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;ots=nIFfqQEQRC&amp;dq=%22Bolsover%2C%20having%20hung%20himself%22&amp;pg=PA18#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Bolsover,%20having%20hung%20himself%22&amp;f=false p. 18]&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory favoured by the [[Oxford English Dictionary|OED]] relates to the alternative definition of a bucket as a beam or yoke that can be used to hang or carry things on.&lt;ref name="phrase"/&gt;&lt;ref name=OED&gt;"Bucket." ''The Oxford English Dictionary''. 2nd ed. 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; The "bucket" may refer to the beam on which [[Animal slaughter|slaughtered]] [[pigs]] are suspended. The animals may struggle on the bucket, hence the expression.&lt;ref name="phrase"/&gt; The word "bucket" still can be used today to refer to such a beam in the [[Norfolk dialect]].&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;''Oxford Dictionary of Idioms'', p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that this definition came from the [[French language|French]] word ''[[trébuchet]]'' or ''buque'', meaning balance.&lt;ref name="phrase"&gt;[http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/218800.html The Phrase Finder]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OED/&gt; [[William Shakespeare]] used the word in this sense in his play [[Henry IV Part II]] where he says:&lt;ref name="phrase"/&gt;
{{quote|Swifter than he that [[wikt:gibbet#Verb|gibbet]]s on the Brewers Bucket.|William Shakespeare|Henry IV Part II}}

A third theory suggests that the origin of the phrase comes from the Catholic custom of holy-water buckets:&lt;ref&gt;"Relics of Popery", Catholic Truth Society London&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|After death, when a body had been laid out ... the holy-water bucket was brought from the church and put at the feet of the corpse. When friends came to pray... they would sprinkle the body with holy water ... it is easy to see how such a saying as "kicking the bucket " came about. Many other explanations of this saying have been given by persons who are unacquainted with Catholic custom|The Right Reverend Abbot Horne|''Relics of Popery''}} Alternatively, in the moment of death a person stretches his legs (in Spanish ''Estirar la pata'' means 'to die') and so might kick the bucket placed there.

Yet another theory seeks to extend the saying beyond its earliest use in the 16th century with reference to the Latin proverb ''Capra Scyria'', the goat that is said to kick over the pail after being milked (920 in Erasmus' [[Adagia]]). Thus a promising beginning is followed by a bad ending or, as [[Andrea Alciato]] phrased it in the Latin poem accompanying the drawing in his ''Emblemata'' (1524), 'Because you have spoilt your fine beginnings with a shameful end and turned your service into harm, you have done what the she-goat does when she kicks the bucket that holds her milk and with her hoof squanders her own riches'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emblems.arts.gla.ac.uk/french/emblem.php?id=FALc140 Emblem 160]&lt;/ref&gt; Here it is the death of one's reputation that is in question.

==American variations==
At one time the American and [[British West Indies|Caribbean]] expression 'kickeraboo' used to be explained as a deformed version of 'kick the bucket'.&lt;ref&gt;John Camden Hotton, The Slang Dictionary, London 1865, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0k1dv1hVdSoC&amp;lpg=PA164&amp;ots=wQWGNw77K1&amp;dq=%22kickeraboo%22%20Slang%20Dictionary&amp;pg=PA164#v=onepage&amp;q=%22kickeraboo%22%20Slang%20Dictionary&amp;f=false pp. 164–65]&lt;/ref&gt; The expression occurs as the title of a mid-19th century American minstrel ballad with the ending 'Massa Death bring one bag and we Kickeraboo'.&lt;ref&gt;Lubrano broadside ballad collection [http://collections.mun.ca/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/broadside&amp;CISOPTR=389&amp;CISOBOX=1&amp;REC=8 68]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is now thought that it may have derived from a native word in one of the West African creoles. The expression 'kek(e)rebu' is first recorded in 1721 with the meaning 'to die' in the [[Krio language]] of [[Sierra Leone]].&lt;ref&gt;On the Anglophone Creole item ''kekrebu'', American English 30/3, 1985, [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/454900?uid=3738032&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21101007321433 pp. 281–83]&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier still 'Kickativoo' is recorded in [[Ghana]] (then known as the Gold or Slave Coast). In 1680 it referred to the capsizing of a canoe but also had the meaning 'to die'.&lt;ref&gt;Magnus Huber, Ghanaian Pidgin English in Its West African Context, John Benjamins Publishing Co. 1999, [https://books.google.com/books?id=U0NFweXVDOgC&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;ots=q3lOMlwx0M&amp;dq=kickeraboo&amp;pg=PA24#v=onepage&amp;q=kickeraboo&amp;f=false p. 24]&lt;/ref&gt;

Whatever [[African American]] usage might have been in the 19th century, by the 20th century they were using the idiom 'kick the bucket'. It occurs in the [[jazz]] classic ''Old Man Mose'', recorded by [[Louis Armstrong]] in the US in 1935, and in the West Indies it figured in the title of the [[reggae]] hit “Long Shot kick de bucket”, recorded by [[The Pioneers (band)|The Pioneers]] in 1969. In the case of the latter, the song refers to the death of a horse.

In [[North America]], a variation of the idiom is 'kick off'.&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary, p. 787&lt;/ref&gt; A related phrase is to "hand in one's dinner pail", a bucket that contains a [[Laborer|worker]]'s [[dinner]].&lt;ref name=oxford/&gt; Another variation, '[[Wish list|bucket list]]', or a list of things to do before one dies, is derived from "to kick the bucket".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bucket%20list | title=Definition of bucket list | publisher=Merriam-Webster | accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Light Painting World Alliance''' (LPWA) is a [[Non profit|nonprofit organization (NPO)]]. Its goal is to offer the [[light painting]] community a cross-border platform to show its art, to set up networks and to promote social concerns and further training by means of light painting.

For this purpose LPWA established a network of local representatives&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lpwalliance.com/lr/|title=Local representatives LPWA|accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; from currently 30 countries worldwide.
It was founded in December 2011 by Russian artist Sergey B. Churkin.
LPWA showcases light painting works of its members in the context of exhibitions, conferences and special events using an advisory board of lightpainters for selection.

In September 2014 LPWA was awarded status as an official Collaborating Partner&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lpwalliance.com/event/66|title=Official Collaborating Partner of the International Year of Light and Light-based Technologies 2015|accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  of the International Year of Light and Light-based Technologies 2015 (IYL2015) by [[UNESCO]].
This happened in accordance with the proclaimed International Year of Light and Light-based Technologies 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.light2015.org/Home/About.html|title=International Year of Light and Light-based Technologies 2015|accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; by UNESCO.
As representatives of LPWA artists Sergey Churkin, Eric Mellinger, Hugo Baptista und [[JanLeonardo]] were officially invited to attend opening ceremonies at UNESCO Headquarters Paris.

'''Make me a sandwich''' is a [[catchphrase]] used in [[popular culture]], often on the internet, to mock or discredit women in a satirical manner. It is a stereotype based on women belonging in the kitchen.&lt;ref name="noton"&gt;(19 April 2010). [http://www.statecollege.com/news/columns/make-me-a-sandwich-not-on-my-watch-391391/ Make Me a Sandwich? Not on My Watch], StateCollege.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="couric"&gt;Elsworth, Catherine (25 July 2008).

For example, during [[Hillary Clinton]]'s 2008 campaign for the Democratic nomination for United States President, it was noted in the news that a [[Facebook]] group had been created titled "Hillary Clinton: Stop Running for President and Make Me a Sandwich."&lt;ref name="abc"&gt;Shipman, Claire (30 May 2008).

[http://nymag.com/news/features/46011/ The Feminist Reawakening], ''New York Magazine''&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase, as used in an intended humorous context, dates to at least 1995.&lt;ref name="gendder1"&gt;Johnson, Allan (10 September 1995).

'''Malinchism''' ({{lang-es|malinchismo}}) or '''malinchist''' ({{lang-es|malinchista}}) is a form of attraction that the foreigner has in the popular imagination, causing individuals to lose the spirit of nationality by moving to the other side, a particular case of [[cultural cringe]].&lt;ref&gt;LEMOS, M. T. T. B. (Org.), DANTAS, Alexis Toribio (Org.), ''América: Visões e Versões - Identidades em confronto'', ed. 7 Letras, 1st edn., Rio, 2010, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; It is derived from the name of [[Hernán Cortés]]'s [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] advisor [[La Malinche]], referring to a deep-rooted Mexican inferiority complex or [[self-hatred]] for the preference for all things foreign to the point of self-destruction.{{sfn|Butler|2004|p=83}} La Malinche is used as a symbol for being supposed to have assisted the Spaniards in destroying Native Americans' way of life, values, norms and culture and exploit the Native American peoples.

"Malinchism" is a pejorative label, expressing disdain for those who are attracted by foreign values, thinking them superior, of better quality and worthy of imitation. In [[Mexico]] and in other countries the term "malinchism" or "malinchist" applies to all those who feel an attraction to foreign cultures and disregard for their own national culture. It also applies to politics, as in [[El Salvador]], in which the leftist political parties call their opponents "malinchist right-wing". The myth of [[Malinche]] and the force of this feeling of disgust crossed the Mexican border, and malinchism came to be applied as a technical term, political, for giving preference to foreign cultures.&lt;ref&gt;LEMOS, M. T. T. B. (Org.), DANTAS, Alexis Toribio (Org.), ''América: Visões e Versões - Identidades em confronto'', ed. 7 Letras, 1st edn., Rio, 2010, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that upper-class consumers in Mexico display malinchism in their preference for American imports, rather than local Mexican brands. As result, American products are sold mostly on the middle class market, and their advertising agencies generally avoid working class and rural areas. They concentrate their efforts on Mexico City, Monterrey, and Guadalajara, which purchase 70 percent of the American imports.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Ueltschy, and John K. Ryans, Jr., "Employing standardized promotion strategies in Mexico: the impact of language and cultural differences," ''International Executive'' (July 1997) 39#4 pp 479+&lt;/ref&gt;

Malinchism is also associated with a societal depiction of women as the source of betrayal and nefarious behavior.&lt;ref name="Schneider (2006)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schneider|first1=Julia Maria|title=Recreating the Image of Women in Mexico:  A Genealogy of Resistance in Mexican Narrative Set During the Revolution|date=2010|volume=Graduate Faculty - Thesis|page=6|url=http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-04142010-170734/unrestricted/schneiderthesis.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100717070125/http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-04142010-170734/unrestricted/schneiderthesis.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-07-17|accessdate=16 February 2015|publisher=Louisiana State University and Agricultural and Mechanical College}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the images of Mexican popular culture, this theme plays out with [[La Malinche|Malinche]] often portrayed as both the deceiver and the deceived. In theatrical productions, she is sometimes portrayed as a victim of conquest, and sometimes the manufacturer of her own destiny; almost always, Malinche is portrayed as [[Guilt (emotion)|guilty]], in a form of [[victim blaming]]. If she was indeed forced to help the conquistadors against her will, it was because she didn't struggle enough; if she was a willing participant, she not only brought her own troubles, but she caused all of her people and her children to suffer.&lt;ref name="Day (2004)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Day|first1=Stuart A.|title=Staging Politics in Mexico: The Road to Neoliberalism|date=2004|publisher=Bucknell University Press|location=Lewisburg [Pa.]|isbn=0-8387-5587-9|pages=125–131|url=https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=wjcglvaWZc8C&amp;lpg|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is represented in art as a figure showing women's [[Instinct#In biology|inborn]] deception and guilt — one who used her sexuality and in so doing betrayed her own unwitting children.&lt;ref name=Lindauer&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lindauer|first1=Margaret A.|title=Devouring Frida: The Art History and Popular Celebrity of Frida Kahlo|date=1999|publisher=Wesleyan Univ.

In ''La Malinche,'' a ballet composed in 1949, by [[José Limón]], Malinche is at first an unwilling victim, then assumes the proud deportment of an aristocrat, and in the end, weighted down by the finery she wears, she gives birth to the [[Mestizo|mixed-race]] child who rejects her.&lt;ref name="Seed (2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Seed|first1=edited by Patricia|title=José Limón and La Malinche: The Dancer and the Dance|date=2008|publisher=University of Texas Press|location=Austin|isbn=978-0-292-71735-0|pages=24–29|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=pTsnFcV1V38C&amp;lpg|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In literature, Malinche has been compared to [[Eve#Mother of humanity|Eve]], the temptress who through deception, leads men astray.&lt;ref name="Cypress (1991)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cypess|first1=Sandra Messinger|title=La Malinche in Mexican literature from history to myth|date=1991|publisher=University of Texas Press|location=Austin|isbn=0-292-75131-1|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=vR7UAAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mennonite Your Way''' (MYW) is a [[hospitality service]] that caters to [[Mennonite]]s. Like all hospitality services, it is an example of [[collaborative consumption]] and [[sharing]]. 

==How it works==
MYW publishes a printed directory of people who are willing to offer [[homestay]]s in their [[residence]]s. There are over 1,700 hosts. Guests must buy the directory for $45; the charge for hosts is $30. Guests must pay to the host a nightly fee of $10 per adult, $2 per child and if breakfast is offered, $2 per meal, unless specified otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mennoniteyourway.com/Myw/about.jsp | title=ABOUT MENNONITE YOUR WAY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Participants are mostly [[Mennonite]]s or other followers of [[Anabaptism]], such as [[Schwarzenau Brethren]]. Hosts are mostly elderly couples and are mostly in areas where there are traditionally many Mennonites of Swiss and South-German ancestry, such as [[Pennsylvania]]. Although MYW operates in 70 counties, almost all hosts are either in the [[United States]], [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], or [[Switzerland]].

==History==
MYW was created in 1976 by [[Mennonite]]s Leon and Nancy Stauffer.

S. 1955. Guest Editorial: Evolution, Cultural and Biological. ''Yearbook of Anthropology'', 2–25.&lt;/ref&gt; This concept has been useful to [[anthropologists]] in refining the definition of [[culture]].  For instance, [[Edward Tylor]], the first academic anthropologist, included both artifacts and such abstract concepts as [[kinship systems]] as elements of culture.  Anthropologist Robert Aunger explains that such an inclusive definition ends up encouraging poor anthropological practice because "it becomes difficult to distinguish what exactly is ''not'' part of culture".&lt;ref name=aunger&gt;{{cite book | title = The Electric Meme: A New Theory of How We Think | author = Robert Aunger | year = 2002 | publisher = The Free Press | place = New York | isbn = 0-7432-0150-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aunger goes on to explain that after the [[cognitive revolution]] in the [[social sciences]] in the 1960s, there is "considerable agreement" among anthropologists that a mentifactual analysis, one that assumes that culture consists of "things in the head" (i.e. mentifacts) is the most appropriate way to define the concept of culture.&lt;ref name=aunger /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10470">'''National memory''' is a form of [[collective memory]] defined by shared experiences and culture. It is an integral part to [[national identity]].

It represents one specific form of [[cultural memory]], which makes an essential contribution to national [[group cohesion]]. Historically national communities have drawn upon commemorative ceremonies and monuments, [[myth]]s and rituals, glorified individuals, objects, and events in their own history to produce a common narrative&lt;!--worldview, conception--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Memory, History, and Colonialism|url=https://www.ghil.ac.uk/fileadmin/redaktion/dokumente/bulletin/GHIL%20Bulletin%20Supplement%201%20(2009).pdf|publisher=German Historical Institute London|accessdate=3 March 2017|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lorraine Ryan, national memory is based on the public's reception of national historic narratives and the ability of people to affirm the legitimacy of these narratives.
&lt;!--'''National remembrance''' ...--&gt;

==Conflicting versions, dynamicity, manipulation and subjectivity==
National memory typically consists of a shared interpretation of a nation's past.&lt;ref name=prague&gt;{{cite book|last1=Paces|first1=Cynthia|title=Prague Panoramas: National Memory and Sacred Space in the Twentieth Century|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Pre|isbn=9780822977674|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=ZztTm-zrjIYC|accessdate=3 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such interpretations can vary and sometimes compete.&lt;ref name=prague/&gt; They can get challenged and augmented by a range of interest groups, fighting to have their histories acknowledged, documented and commemorated and reshape national stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weedon|first1=Chris|last2=Jordan|first2=Glenn|title=Collective memory: theory and politics|journal=Social Semiotics|date=April 2012|volume=22|issue=2|pages=143–153|doi=10.1080/10350330.2012.664969}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often national memory is adjusted to offer a politicized vision of the past to make a political position appear consistent with national identity.&lt;ref name="civil"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graber|first1=Samuel J.|title=Twice-divided Nation: The Civil War and National Memory in the Transatlantic World|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=9781109024135|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=S7oq4-MZcr4C|accessdate=3 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it profoundly affects how historical facts are perceived and recorded and may circumvent or appropriate facts.&lt;ref name="civil"/&gt; A repertoire of discursive strategies functions to emotionalize national narrative and nationalize personal pasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=White|first1=Geoffrey M.|title=Emotional Remembering: The Pragmatics of National Memory|journal=Ethos|date=December 1999|volume=27|issue=4|pages=505–529|doi=10.1525/eth.1999.27.4.505|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229796645_Emotional_Remembering_The_Pragmatics_of_National_Memory|accessdate=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

National memory has been used calculatedly by governments for dynastic, political, religious and cultural purposes since as early as the sixteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gillis|first1=John R.|title=Commemorations: The Politics of National Identity|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0691029253|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=WAB4sd2nFyMC|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marketing of memory by the [[culture industry]] and its instrumentalisation for political purposes can both be seen as serious threats to the objective understanding of a nation's past.&lt;ref name=ww2.0/&gt;

Lorraine Ryan notes that individual memory both shapes and is shaped by national memory, and that there is a competition between the dominant and individual memories of a nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ryan|first1=Lorraine|title=Cosmopolitan memory and national memory conflicts: On the dynamics of their interaction|journal=Journal of Sociology|date=28 November 2012|volume=50|issue=4|pages=501–514|doi=10.1177/1440783312467097|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hyung Park states that the nation is continuously revived, re-imagined, reconstituted, through shared memories among its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Park|first1=Hyung yu|title=Shared national memory as intangible heritage|journal=Annals of Tourism Research|date=April 2011|volume=38|issue=2|pages=520–539|doi=10.1016/j.annals.2010.11.013|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256987216_Shared_national_memory_as_intangible_heritage_Re-imagining_Two_Koreas_as_One_Nation|accessdate=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

National memories may also conflict&lt;!--/collide--&gt; with the other nations' collective memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pomian|first1=Krzysztof|title=Divided memory: European sites of memory as political and cultural phenomenon|url=http://www.enrs.eu/pl/articles/219-divided-memory|accessdate=3 March 2017|language=pl-pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of the media==
Reports that are narrated&lt;!--/written--&gt; in terms of national memory characterize the past in ways that merge the past, the present and the future into "a single ongoing tale".&lt;ref name="medmem"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garde-Hansen|first1=Joanne|title=Media and Memory|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=9780748688883|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=xdpvAAAAQBAJ|accessdate=3 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pierre Nora]] argues that a "democratisation of history" allows for emancipatory versions of the past to surface:&lt;ref name=ww2.0&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bruyn|first1=Dieter De|title=World War 2.0: Commemorating War and Holocaust in Poland through Facebook|issn=2043-7633}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|National memory cannot come into being until the historical framework of the nation has been shattered. It reflects the abandonment of the traditional channels and modes of transmission of the past and the desacralisation of such primary sites of initiation as the school, the family, the museum, and the monument: what was once the responsibility of these institutions has now flowed over into the public domain and been taken over by the media and tourist industry|source=Nora 1998, 363&lt;ref name="medmem"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ww2.0/&gt;}}
&lt;!--More: &lt;ref name="civil"/&gt;--&gt;

However, national history being passed on by the culture industry, such as by [[historical films]], can be seen as serious threats to the objective understanding of a nation's past.&lt;ref name=ww2.0/&gt;

===International media===
{{See also|Global news flow|Category:Cultural exchange|International communication}}
Nations' memories can be shared across nations via media such as the [[Internet]]&lt;!-- and thereby help globalize national memories--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=ANDREWS|first1=MAGGIE|last2=BAGOT-JEWITT|first2=CHARLIE|last3=HUNT|first3=NIGEL|title=Introduction: National memory and war|journal=Journal of War &amp; Culture Studies|date=8 December 2011|volume=4|issue=3|pages=283–288|doi=10.1386/jwcs.4.3.283_7|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269606175_Introduction_National_memory_and_war|language=en|issn=1752-6272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects and functions ==
National memory can be a force of cohesion as well as division and conflict. It can foster constructive national reforms, international communities and agreements,&lt;ref name="civil"/&gt; dialogue as well as deepen problematic courses and rhetoric.

[[Identity crisis]] can occur due to bad memories (such as national crimes)&lt;!--cn--&gt; or the absence of a belief in a shared past.&lt;ref name="civil"/&gt;{{Additional citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Often new developments, processes, problems and events are [[Sensemaking|made sense of]] and contextualized by drawing from national memory.

== Critical national memory ==
Critical history or historic memory cuts from national memory's tradition centric to national heritage and orients itself towards a specialized study of history in a more [[sociological]] [[Historical sociology|manner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Koshar|first1=Rudy J.|title=Germany's Transient Pasts: Preservation and National Memory in the Twentieth Century|publisher=Univ of North Carolina Press|isbn=9780807862629|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=yVzMCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA7&amp;lpg=PA7|accessdate=3 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been proposed that the unthinkable ought not to be unmasked but that instead what made it thinkable should be reconstructed and that the difficulty of discussing the non-places or the bad places of national memory make it necessary to include forgetfulness and amnesia in the concept.&lt;ref name=places&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Montaño|first1=Eugenia Allier|title=Places of memory. Is the concept applicable to the analysis of memorial struggles? The case of Uruguay and its recent past|url=http://socialsciences.scielo.org/pdf/s_cclaeh/v4nse/scs_a01.pdf|accessdate=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=March 2017}}

National memory may lead to questioning the nation as it is as well as its identity and imply a societal negotiation of what the country wishes to be as a nation. To understand the links between memory, forgetfulness, identity and the imaginary construction of the nation analysis of the discourse in the places of memory is fundamental as in all writings of national history an image of the nation is being restructured.&lt;ref name=places/&gt;

'''Paris syndrome''' ({{lang-fr|Syndrome de Paris}}, {{lang-ja|パリ症候群}}, ''Pari shōkōgun'') is a condition exhibited by some individuals when visiting or going on vacation to [[Paris]], as a result of extreme shock derived from their discovery that Paris is not what they had expected it to be. The syndrome is characterized by a number of psychiatric symptoms such as acute [[delusion]]al states, [[hallucination]]s, feelings of [[persecution]] (perceptions of being a victim of [[prejudice]], [[aggression]], or [[hostility]] from others), [[derealization]], [[depersonalization]], [[anxiety]], and also [[psychosomatic]] manifestations such as [[dizziness]], [[tachycardia]], [[sweating]], and others, such as vomiting.&lt;ref name="bbc.6205403"&gt;{{cite news |year= 2009 |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/6205403.stm|title = Mastering French manners, the hard way|format = |publisher = [[BBC News]]| accessdate = 4 November 2009 | last=Wyatt, Caroline   |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar syndromes include [[Jerusalem syndrome]] and [[Stendhal syndrome]]. The condition is commonly viewed as a severe form of [[culture shock]]. It is particularly noted among [[Japanese people|Japanese]] travelers. It is not listed as a recognised condition in the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]''.

==History==
Professor Hiroaki Ota, a Japanese psychiatrist working in France, is credited as the first person to diagnose the condition in 1986.&lt;ref name="BBC strikes"/&gt; Later work by Youcef Mahmoudia, a physician with the hospital [[Hôtel-Dieu de Paris]], indicates that Paris syndrome is "psychopathology related to travel, rather than a syndrome of the traveller."&lt;ref name="aphp"&gt;{{cite web|date=21 November 2002|url=http://www.aphp.fr/site/actualite/mag_voyage_pathologique.htm|title=Voyage pathologique: Voyager rend-il fou ?

'''Passive fluency''' is where a person can [[Fluency|fluently]] read and audibly understand a [[language]] whilst not having the ability to fluently speak or write the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last= Leap | first= W. | date= 1988 | title= Indian language renewal | journal= Human Organization | publisher= | volume= 47 | issue= 4 | pages= 283–291 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Passive fluency is often brought about by being raised in one language (which becomes the person's passive language) and being schooled in another language (which becomes the person's native language).&lt;ref name = "basham"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Basham | first = Charlotte | last2 = Fathman | first2 = Ann | date = 19 December 2008 | title = The Latent Speaker: Attaining Adult Fluency in an Endangered Language | journal = International Journal of Bilingual Education and Bilingualism | volume = 11 | issue = 5 | pages = 577–597 | doi = 10.1080/13670050802149192 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

People who are passively fluent in a language are often [[latent speakers]] who were raised in an environment where the language was spoken but did not become native speakers.&lt;ref name = "basham" /&gt;

==Language Attitudes regarding "Passive Bilinguals"==
A more common term for this phenomenon is 'passive bilingualism'. Grosjean argues that there has been a monolingual bias regarding who is considered a 'bilingual', where people who do not have equal competence in all their languages are judges not speaking properly. 'Balanced bilinguals' are, in fact, very rare, and the fluency of a bilingual in his/ her languages is domain- specific: it depends on what they need the languages for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grosjean|first1=François|title=Bilingual : Life and Reality|date=2010|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Massachusetts|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that speakers may not admit to their fluency in their passive language, despite the fact that there are social (extralinguistic) factors underlying their different competencies.

==A Need for Passive Bilinguals in Basque Country==
Karlos Cid Abasolo discusses that passive bilingualism would be a minimum requirement for the co- official status of Basque and Spanish to become a working reality. As there are currently many monolingual Spanish speakers, and no monolingual Basque speakers, there is not yet a situation where an individual fluent in Basque could speak in his/ her mother tongue, regardless of the domain, circumstance  or interlocutor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abasolo|first1=Karlos Cid|title=Bilingüísmo, monolingüísmo y sesquilingüismo en la Comunidad Autónoma Vasca|journal=Revista de Filología Románica|date=2009|volume=26|pages=229–242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7260">The '''purple economy''' is that part of the [[economy]] which contributes to [[sustainable development]] by promoting the cultural potential of goods and services.

“The purple economy refers to taking account of cultural aspects in economics. It designates an economy that adapts to the human diversity in globalization and that relies on the cultural dimension to give value to goods and services.”&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.lejournaldesarts.fr/jda/archives/docs_article/89661/lactualite-vue-par-jerome-gouadain-promoteur-du-concept-d---economie-mauve---.php Le Journal des Arts]&lt;/ref&gt; These two trends, one vertical and one horizontal, feed one another. In fact the growth in the cultural component attached to products is linked to each territory’s cultural vitality.

== Surge in culture ==
The context of the purple economy is that of the growing importance of culture in contemporary society. The factors involved in this include in particular:&lt;ref name=diversum20170630&gt;Diversum, Gilles Andrier, Loïc Armand, Francesco Bandarin, Jérôme Bédier, Françoise Benhamou, Fouad Benseddik, Gilles Boëtsch, [[Dominique Bourg]], Jérôme Gouadain, Maria Gravari-Barbas, Marc-Antoine Jamet, [[François Jullien]], [[Pascal Lamy]], [[Jacques Lévy]], [[Gilles Lipovetsky]], Françoise Montenay, Jean Musitelli, Patrick O’Quin, Philippe d’Ornano, [[Dominique Perrault]], Marie-Hélène Plainfossé, Nicole Rouvet, [http://diversum.net/fr/association/a.php?t=document-de-reference&amp;id=74presse| “The Cultural Footprint of the Cosmetic Sector”] (accessed 22 February 2018).&lt;/ref&gt; a global economic and political readjustment in favour of emerging countries, a return to local environments (once again perceived as centres for stability), new forms of claims (following on from the collapse of the great ideologies), growing social demand for quality based on cultural consumption patterns (which go hand in hand with the logic of popularization, individualization and longer life expectancies), innovative approaches (that presuppose a cultural state of mind and interdisciplinarity conducive to [[serendipity]]), and so on.

== Scope ==
The purple economy is multidisciplinary, in that it enriches all goods and services by capitalizing on the cultural dimension inherent to every sector. The sensory, experiential economy is one application of this.&lt;ref name=diversum20170630/&gt;

It differs from the [[Economics of the arts and literature|cultural economy]], which is sector-based.

In June 2013, the conclusions of a first inter-institutional working group on the purple economy, formed of experts from [[UNESCO]], the [[OECD]], the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|International Organisation of the Francophonie]], French ministries, various companies and civil society. That document underscored the impact of the phenomenon of culturalization, which now affects the entire economy, with follow-on effects on employment and training. The report differentiates between ''purple jobs'' and ''purplifying professions'': the former are directly linked to the cultural environment by their very purpose (like town planners and developers), while the latter are merely caused to transform under the effect of culturalization (such as positions in human resources or in marketing and communications).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diversum.net/fichiers/File/The%20purple%20economy,%20an%20objective,%20an%20opportunity.pdf Conclusions of the first inter-institutional working group on the purple economy]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another reference document published in June 2017&lt;ref name=diversum20170630/&gt; mentioned various aspects of the human environment in which economics are likely to produce cultural benefits: architecture, art, colours, enjoyment, ethics, heritage, imagination, learning, social skills, singularity, etc.

== Origin ==
The term first appeared in 2011, in France, in a manifest&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2011/05/19/l-economie-mauve-une-nouvelle-alliance-entre-culture-et-economie_1524674_3232.html Le Monde.fr]&lt;/ref&gt; published on [[Le Monde|Le Monde.fr]].

[http://www.diversum.net/fichiers/File/Asso_diversum_10-05-2010_en.pdf Source]&lt;/ref&gt; which organized the first International Purple Economy Forum under the patronage of [[UNESCO]], the [[European Parliament]] and the [[European Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.purple-economy.org Website of the International Purple Economy Forum]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Connection to sustainable development ==
[[File:Sustainable economy.gif|thumb|The three components of a sustainable economy]]

The purple economy emphasizes the presence of [[externalities]]: the cultural environment from which agents draw and on which, in return, they leave their own footprints is a [[common good]]. As a result, the purple economy sees culture as an axis for [[sustainable development]].

In fact, culture has been a whole sub-section of sustainability since the beginning. [[Corporate social responsibility]] can even be said to have originated in the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] adopted by the United Nations in 1966.

This issue is just one of the different components of [[sustainable development]], alongside concerns relating to the [[natural environment]] ([[green economy]]) and to the [[social environment]] ([[social economy]]). The complementary nature of these aspects of the sustainable economy was reaffirmed in a call&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2015/06/30/la-reponse-au-rechauffement-est-aussi-culturelle_4664807_3232.html Le Monde Économie]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;By: [[Pierre Bellon]], Véronique Cayla, [[Bertrand P.

In [[cultural anthropology]], '''reciprocity''' refers to the [[Non-market economics|non-market exchange]] of goods or labour ranging from direct [[barter]] (immediate exchange)  to forms of [[gift economy|gift exchange]] where a return is eventually expected (delayed exchange) as in the exchange of birthday gifts. It is thus distinct from the true gift, where no return is expected.&lt;ref name="Parry 1986 467"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Parry|first=Jonathan|title=The Gift, the Indian Gift and the 'Indian Gift'|journal=Man|year=1986|volume=21|issue=3|pages=466–8|doi=10.2307/2803096}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reciprocity is said to be the basis of most non-market exchange. David Graeber argues, "as currently used, 'reciprocity' can mean almost anything. It is very close to meaningless."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|title=Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value: The false coin of our own dreams|year=2001|publisher=Palgrave|location=New York|page=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the exchange is immediate, as in [[barter]], it does not create a social relationship. When the exchange is delayed, it creates both a relationship as well as an obligation for a return (i.e. debt). Hence, some forms of reciprocity can establish hierarchy if the debt is not repaid. The failure to make a return may end a relationship between equals. Reciprocal exchanges can also have a political effect through the creation of multiple obligations and the establishment of leadership, as in the [[Moka exchange|gift exchanges (Moka)]] between [[Big man (anthropology)|Big Men]] in Melanesia. Some forms of reciprocity are thus closely related to [[Redistribution (cultural anthropology)|redistribution]], where goods and services are collected by a central figure for eventual distribution to followers.&lt;ref name="Sahlins 1972"&gt;{{cite book | last = Sahlins | first = Marshall |authorlink=Marshall Sahlins | title = Stone Age Economics | publisher = Aldine-Atherton | location = Chicago | year = 1972 | isbn = 0-202-01099-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marshall Sahlins]], a well-known American cultural anthropologist, identified three main types of reciprocity (generalized, balanced and negative) in the book ''Stone Age Economics'' (1972).&lt;ref name="Sahlins 1972"/&gt; Reciprocity was also the general principal used by [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] to explain the ''Elementary Structures of Kinship'' (1949), in one of the most influential works on kinship theory in the post-war period.

== The history of the "norm of reciprocity" in European economic thought ==

Annette Weiner argued that the "[[norm of reciprocity]]" is deeply implicated in the development of Western economic theory. Both [[John Locke]] and [[Adam Smith]] used the idea of reciprocity to justify a free market without state intervention. Reciprocity was used, on the one hand, to legitimize the idea of a self-regulating market; and to argue how individual vice was transformed into social good on the other. Western economic theorists starting with the eighteenth century Scots economists Sir James Steuart and Smith differentiated pre-modern natural (or self-subsistent) economies from civilized economies marked by a division of labour that necessitated exchange. Like early sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]], they viewed natural economies as characterized by [[mechanical solidarity]] (like so many peas in a pod) whereas the civilized division of labour made producers mutually dependent upon one another resulting in [[organic solidarity]]. These oppositions solidified by the late nineteenth century in the evolutionary idea of primitive communism marked by mechanical solidarity as the antithesis and alter ego of Western "''[[Homo economicus]]''". It is this armchair anthropology opposition that originally informed modern anthropological debate when Malinowski sought to overturn the opposition and argue that archaic societies are equally regulated by the norm of reciprocity and maximizing behaviour.&lt;ref name=Weiner&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Annette|title=Inalienable Possessions: The paradox of keeping-while-giving|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|28–33}}

The concept was key to the debate between early anthropologists [[Bronislaw Malinowski]] and [[Marcel Mauss]] on the meaning of "[[Kula ring|Kula exchange]]" in the [[Trobriand Islands]] off Papua New Guinea during the First World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Malinowski|first=Bronislaw|title=Argonauts of the Western Pacific: An Account of Native Enterprise and Adventure in the Archipelagos of Melanesian New Guinea|year=1922|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Malinowski used Kula exchange to demonstrate the apparently random gift-giving was in fact a key political process by which non-state political leadership spanning a vast archipelago was established. Gift-giving, he argued, was not altruistic (as it supposedly is in our society) but politically motivated for individual gain. Marcel Mauss theorized the impetus for a return as "the spirit of the gift," an idea that has provoked a long debate in [[economic anthropology]] on what motivated the reciprocal exchange.&lt;ref name="Parry 1986 467"/&gt; Claude Lévi-Strauss, drawing on Mauss, argued there were three spheres of exchange governed by reciprocity: language (exchange of words), kinship (exchange of women), and economics (exchange of things). He thus claimed all human relationships are based on the norm of reciprocity.&lt;ref name="Graeber 2011 91"&gt;{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|title=Debt: the first 5,000 years|year=2011|publisher=Melville House|location=New York|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; This claim has been disputed by anthropologists Jonathan Parry,&lt;ref name="Parry 1986 467"/&gt; [[Inalienable possessions|Annette Weiner]],&lt;ref name=Weiner/&gt; and [[David Graeber]]&lt;ref name="Graeber 2011 91"/&gt; amongst others.

== Basic types ==

===The domestic mode of production===
Marshall Sahlins has emphasized that non-market exchange is constrained by social relationships. That is, exchange in non-market societies is less about acquiring the [[means of production]] (whether land or tools) and more about the [[Redistribution (cultural anthropology)|redistribution]] of finished goods throughout a community. These social relationships are largely [[kinship]] based. His discussion of types of reciprocity is located within what he calls the "domestic mode of production." His typology of reciprocity thus refers to "cultures lacking a political state, and it applies only insofar as economy and social relations have not been modified by the historic penetration of states."&lt;ref name="Sahlins 1972"/&gt;{{rp|186–8}} Paul Sillitoe has extended the analysis of reciprocity in these conditions, arguing that the type of reciprocity found will depend upon which sphere of production is being examined. The production of subsistence goods is under the control of domestic units and hence marked by generalized reciprocity. Wealth objects – by their nature from outside – are competitively exchanged to acquire status, but no one is able to control their production and hence centralize power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sillitoe|first=Paul|title=Why Spheres of exchange|journal=Ethnology|year=2006|volume=45|issue=1|page=16|doi=10.2307/4617561}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sahlins' typology====

In these circumstances, reciprocal exchange can be divided in two types: dyadic back-and-forth exchange (reciprocity), and pooling ([[Redistribution (cultural anthropology)|redistribution]]). Pooling is a system of reciprocities. It is a ''within'' group relationship, whereas reciprocity is a ''between'' relationship. Pooling establishes a centre, whereas reciprocity inevitably establishes two distinct parties with their own interests.&lt;ref name="Sahlins 1972"/&gt;{{rp|188}} While the most basic form of pooling is that of food within the family, it is also the basis for sustained community efforts under a political leader.

Reciprocity, in contrast, is a dyadic exchange covering a range of possibilities, depending on individual interests. These interests will vary according to the social distance of the parties.&lt;ref name="Sahlins 1972"/&gt;{{rp|191}} A range of kinds of reciprocity can thus be sketched out, according to Sahlins:

* ''Generalized reciprocity'' refers to putatively altruistic transactions, the "true gift" marked by "weak reciprocity" due to the vagueness of the obligation to reciprocate. The material side of the transaction (the exchange of equally valuable goods) is repressed by the social side and the reckoning of debts is avoided. The time for the return gift is indefinite and not qualified in quantity or quality. A failure to reciprocate does not result in the giver ceasing to give.&lt;ref name="Sahlins 1972"/&gt;{{rp|193–4}}
* ''Balanced or Symmetrical reciprocity'' refers to direct exchange of customary equivalents without any delay, and hence includes some forms of 'gift-exchange,' as well as purchases with 'primitive money.'  The exchange is less social, and is dominated by the material exchange and individual interests.&lt;ref name="Sahlins 1972"/&gt;{{rp|194–5}}
* ''Negative reciprocity'' is the attempt to get "something for nothing with impunity." It may be described as 'haggling,' 'barter,' or 'theft.' It is the most impersonal form of exchange, with interested parties seeking to maximize their gains.&lt;ref name="Sahlins 1972"/&gt;{{rp|195}}

====Reciprocity and kinship distance====

This typology of reciprocal exchange was developed by Sahlins in relation to the domestic mode of production (i.e. 'stone age economics') and hence should be contrasted with the 19th century armchair conceptions of 'primitive communism.' Within this same domestic mode of production, the degree of social distance – kinship in particular – affects the kind of reciprocity. Since kinship is the major way in which these societies are organized, nonkin (strangers) are viewed negatively. A general model of reciprocity must recognize that the closeness of the kin tie will vary according to the type of [[kinship]] system. In so far as kinship also determines residence, kinship closeness may also translate into spatial closeness. Hence one finds generalized reciprocity within the household-kinship group, balanced reciprocity within a spatial community, and negative reciprocity with outsiders (i.e. outside the community). The kind of reciprocity reflects the moral nature of the social relationship, hence morality is not universal, but dependent on social distance. Sahlins' model thus views reciprocity as socially, morally and economically structured and "the structure is that of kinship-tribal groups" not a universalizing moral ethic.&lt;ref name="Sahlins 1972"/&gt;{{rp|196–201}}

==== Reciprocity and kinship rank ====
With rank comes privileges. However, in traditional societies "social inequality is more the organization of economic equality. Often, in fact, high rank is only secured or sustained by o'ercrowing generosity."&lt;ref name="Sahlins 1972"/&gt;{{rp|205}} Rank is usually generational, with elders having seniority, but still held by the bounds of close kinship. Generalized reciprocity by such elders may be a "starting mechanism" for more general hierarchy, by placing many in the giver's debt. This leads to the question, "when does reciprocity give way to redistribution."&lt;ref name="Sahlins 1972"/&gt;{{rp|209}} Sahlins argues that chiefly redistribution is not different in principle and nothing but a highly organized form of kinship-rank reciprocity.

===Reciprocity in market-based societies===

David Graeber argues, in contrast, that balanced gift exchange and market exchange have more in common than normally assumed. Since both are balanced, the social relationship created through the sense of debt and obligation is constantly in danger of being ended by the return gift/exchange. He thinks it better to contrast

* "''open''" and "''closed''" reciprocity. Open reciprocity "keeps no accounts because it implies a relation of permanent mutual commitment." This open reciprocity is closed off precisely when it is balanced. Thought of in this way, we can see the relationship as a matter of degree, more or less open or closed. Closed reciprocity of gifts is most like market exchange. It is competitive, individualistic and may border on barter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|title=Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value: The false coin of our own dreams|year=2001|publisher=Palgrave|location=New York|pages=219–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reciprocity and marital alliance ==
{{main|Alliance theory}}

The '''alliance theory''' (or '''general theory of exchanges''') is the name given to the [[structuralism|structural]] method of studying [[kinship]] relations. It finds its origins in [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]'s ''Elementary Structures of Kinship'' (1949). According to Levi-Strauss, the [[universality (philosophy)|universal]] prohibition of incest pushes human groups towards [[exogamy]] where certain categories of kin are forbidden to marry. The incest taboo is thus a negative prescription; without it, nothing would push men to go searching for women outside of their inner kinship circle, or vice versa. In a process akin to the division of labour which makes exchange necessary, one's daughter or sister is offered to someone outside a family circle, and starts a circle of exchange of women: in return, the giver is entitled to a woman from the other's intimate kinship group. Thus the negative prescriptions of the prohibition have positive counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], ''Les structures élémentaires de la parenté'', Paris, Mouton, 1967, 2ème édition, p.60''&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of the alliance theory is thus of a reciprocal or a generalized exchange which founds [[affinity (law)|affinity]], just as economic exchange due to the division of labour resulted in [[organic solidarity]]. This global phenomena takes the form of a "circulation of women" which links together the various social groups in one whole: society. Lévi-Strauss emphasizes this a system of generalized exchange based on indirect reciprocity. A generalized system does not involve a direct or balanced dyadic exchange and hence presupposes an expansion of trust.&lt;ref name="Parry 1986 467"/&gt;

'''Social Networking Pedagogy''' is a [[philosophy of education]] described by curriculum theorists [[Thomas Patrick Huston]] and [http://education.indiana.edu/Default.aspx?TabId=16364 Hallie DeCatherine Jones]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} as a form of learner-driven [[participatory culture]] where the user’s experience is reciprocal, consisting of a range of input and output experiences mediated by [[Social_network|social networking]] technologies.  The range of individual and unique differentiated user experiences form a composite impression on the individual which functions as an [[Epistemology|epistemic form]] of how we come to know and experience the world and its social, cultural, political and economic realities.     

In educational settings, social networking pedagogical approaches place [[Social_network|social networking]] technologies at their core, thus presenting expansive opportunities for education to extend the [[curriculum]] beyond the traditional walls of educational institutions by reaching into the daily-lived experiences of individuals. The [[Archive|archival]] features and lack of [[Temporality|temporal]] constraints associated with Internet technologies sustain continually changing currents that educators can connect to [[Student_voice|student-driven]] interests by engaging them with [[Trending_topic#Trends|trending topics]].  Through Social Network Pedagogy, educators can develop a teaching [[Praxis_(process)|praxis]] where the classroom and social space blend and individuals’ creative contributions are acknowledged for their cultural value.  

[http://education.indiana.edu/Default.aspx?TabId=16364 Jones]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} and [[Thomas_Patrick_Huston|Huston]] began theorizing the development of Social Networking Pedagogy during their tenure as doctoral students at the [[Indiana University School of Education]] where they were colleagues in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20120507204235/http://education.indiana.edu/Default.aspx?alias=education.indiana.edu%2Fedci Department of Curriculum and Instruction].  They point to the fields of [[cultural studies]] and [[critical pedagogy]], especially the contributions of [http://davidtrend.net/ David Trend] with his book [https://books.google.com/books/about/Cultural_Pedagogy.html?id=B5kYZvntIEwC Cultural Pedagogy" Art, Education, Politics] and critical theorist [[Henry Giroux]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41406">[[image:LippenStudium1.JPG|thumb|250px|right|[[Children]] copy with their own [[mouth]]s the words spoken by the mouths of those around them. This enables them to learn the [[pronunciation]] of words not already in their [[vocabulary]].]]
'''Speech repetition''' is the [[speech|saying]] by one individual of the spoken [[Speech production|vocalizations]] made by another individual. This requires the ability in the person making the copy to map the sensory input they [[Hearing (sense)|hear]] from the other person's vocal [[pronunciation]] into a similar motor output with their own [[vocal tract]].

Such speech input output imitation often occurs independently of speech comprehension such as in [[speech shadowing]] when a person automatically says words heard in [[earphone]]s, and the pathological condition of [[echolalia]] in which people [[reflex]]ively repeat overheard words. This links to speech repetition of words being separate in the [[human brain|brain]] to [[speech perception]]. Speech repetition occurs in the  dorsal speech processing stream while speech perception occurs in the ventral speech processing stream. Repetitions are often incorporated unawares by this route into spontaneous novel sentences immediately or after delay following  storage in [[Baddeley's model of working memory#Phonological loop|phonological memory]].

In humans, the ability to map heard input vocalizations into motor output is highly developed due to this copying ability playing a critical role in a child's rapid expansion of their  [[Vocabulary#Vocabulary growth|spoken vocabulary]]. In older children and adults it still remains important as it enables the continued learning of novel words and names and [[Second language acquisition|additional languages]]. Such repetition is also necessary for the propagation of language from generation to generation. It has also been suggested that the phonetic units out of which speech is made have been selected upon by the process of vocabulary expansion and vocabulary [[cultural evolution|transmission]]s  due to  children preferentially copying words in terms of more easily imitated elementary units.

The ability to repeat and imitate speech sounds occurs separately to that of normal speech. Speech shadowing provides evidence of a 'privileged' input/output speech loop that is distinct to the other components of the speech system.&lt;ref name="McLeod"&gt;McLeod P. Posner MI. (1984).

===Effector independent===
Speech sounds can be imitatively mapped into vocal articulations in spite of vocal tract anatomy differences in size and shape due to [[gender]], [[Human development (biology)|age]] and individual [[anatomical]] variability. Such variability is extensive making input output mapping of speech more complex than a simple mapping of vocal track movements. The shape of the mouth varies widely: [[dentist]]s recognize three basic shapes of [[palate]]: trapezoid, ovoid, and triagonal; six types of [[malocclusion]] between the two [[jaw]]s; nine ways teeth relate to the [[dental arch]] and a wide range of [[maxilla]]ry and [[human mandible|mandible]] deformities.&lt;ref&gt;Bloomer HH. (1971). Speech defects associated with dental malocclusions and related abnormalities. In L. E. (Eds), Handbook of speech pathology and audiology (pp. 715-766), New York, Appleton Century. {{ISBN|978-0-13-381764-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vocal sound can also vary due to dental injury and [[dental caries]]. Other factors that do not impede  the sensory motor mapping needed for vocal imitation  are gross oral deformations such as [[hare-lip]]s, [[cleft palate]]s or amputations of the tongue tip, pipe smoking, pencil biting and teeth clinching (such as in [[ventriloquism]]). [[Paranasal sinuses]]  vary between individuals 20-fold in volume, and differ in the presence and the degree of their  asymmetry.&lt;ref&gt;Williams RJ. (1967). You are extra-ordinary. New York, Random House.  pp. 26-27. {{OCLC|156187572}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vocal traits also vary moreover when people get upper respiratory tract infections  as the shape and size of sinus cavities is further changed with the swelling of mucous membranes.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diverse linguistic vocalizations===
Vocal imitation occurs potentially in regard to a diverse range of phonetic units and types of vocalization. The world's languages use [[consonant|consonantal phone]]s that differ in thirteen imitable vocal tract [[place of articulation]]s (from the [[lip]]s to the [[glottis]]). These phones can potentially be pronounced with eleven types of imitable [[manner of articulation]]s ([[nasal stop]]s to [[lateral click]]s). Speech can be copied in regard to its [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|social accent]], [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]], [[Pitch accent|pitch]] and individuality (as with entertainment [[impersonator]]s). Speech can be articulated in ways which diverge considerably in speed, [[timbre]], pitch, [[loudness]] and [[emotion]]. Speech further exists in different forms such as [[song]], [[Poetry|verse]], [[Vociferation|scream]] and [[whispering|whisper]]. Intelligible speech can be produced with pragmatic intonation and in [[regional dialect]]s and [[Accent (dialect)|foreign accents]]. These aspects are readily copied: people asked to repeat speech-like words imitate not only phones but also accurately other pronunciation aspects such as [[fundamental frequency]],&lt;ref name="Kappes"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kappes | first1 = J. | last2 = Baumgaertner | first2 = A. | last3 = Peschke | first3 = C. | last4 = Ziegler | first4 = W. | title = Unintended imitation in nonword repetition | doi = 10.1016/j.bandl.2009.08.008 | journal = Brain and Language | volume = 111 | issue = 3 | pages = 140–151 | year = 2009 | pmid =  19811813| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[schwa]]-syllable expression,&lt;ref name="Kappes"/&gt; voice [[spectrum|spectra]] and lip [[kinematic]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid= 16698051|year= 2007|author1= Gentilucci|first1= M|title= Imitation during phoneme production|journal= Neuropsychologia|volume= 45|issue= 3|pages= 608–15|last2= Bernardis|first2= P|doi= 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2006.04.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[voice onset time]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Mechanism==

Spoken words are sequences of motor movements organized around vocal tract gesture motor targets.&lt;ref&gt;Shaffer LH. (1984). Motor programming in language production. In H. Bouma &amp; D. G. Bouwhuis, (Eds), Attention and performance, X. pp. (17-41). London, Erlbaum. {{ISBN|978-0-86377-005-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vocalization due to this is copied in terms of the motor goals that organize it rather than the exact movements with which it is produced. These vocal motor goals are auditory. According to James Abbs&lt;ref&gt;Abbs JH. (1986). Invariance and variability in speech production, A distinction between linguistic intent and its neuromotor implementation. In J. S. Perkell, &amp; D. H. Klatt, (Eds), Invariance and variability in speech processes (pp. 202-219). Hillsdale, NJ, Erlbaum. {{ISBN|978-0-89859-545-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'For speech motor actions, the individual articulatory movements would not appear to be controlled with regard to three- dimensional spatial targets, but rather with regard to their contribution to complex vocal tract goals such as resonance properties (e.g., shape, degree of constriction) and or aerodynamically significant variables'. Speech sounds also have duplicable higher-order characteristics such as rates and shape of modulations and rates and shape of frequency shifts.&lt;ref&gt;Porter RJ. (1987). What is the relation between speech production and speech perception? In: Allport A, MacKay D G, Prinz W G, Scheerer E, eds. Language Perception and Production. London: Academic Press,: 85-106. {{ISBN|978-0-12-052750-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such complex auditory goals (which often link—though not always—to internal vocal gestures) are detectable from the speech sound which they create.

==Neurology==

===Dorsal speech processing stream function===

Two cortical processing streams exist: a ventral one which maps sound onto meaning, and a dorsal one, that maps  sound onto motor representations. The dorsal stream projects from the posterior [[Sylvian fissure]] at the [[temporoparietal junction]], onto frontal motor areas, and is not normally involved in speech perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Evolution and language==
Human language is a vocabulary-based form of communication that  unlike that of other animals employs tens of thousands of lexicals and names. This requires that young humans new to language have the ability to quickly learn both the pronunciations and use of many thousands of words. If children could not repeat speech without problems,  human language could not exist.&lt;ref name="skoyles"/&gt;  This makes the evolution of the capacity of speech repetition a critical innovation needed for the [[origin of speech]]&lt;ref name="skoyles"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motor theory of speech imitation argues that this need for speech to be imitable not speech perception nor [[speech production]] moreover underlies the evolved nature of the [[vowel]] and consonant units of phonetics.&lt;ref name="skoyles"/&gt;

==Sign language==
Words in [[sign languages]], unlike those in spoken ones, are made not of sequential units but of [[Three-dimensional space|spatial]] configurations of subword unit arrangements, the spatial analogue of the sonic-chronological [[morpheme]]s of spoken language.&lt;ref name="Poizner"&gt;Poizner H. Klima ES. Bellugi U. (1987). What the hands reveal about the brain. MIT Press. {{ISBN|978-0-262-66066-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These words, like spoken ones, are learnt by imitation.  Indeed, rare cases of compulsive sign-language echolalia exist in otherwise language-deficient deaf autistic individuals born into signing families.&lt;ref name="Poizner"/&gt; At least some cortical areas neurobiologically active during both sign and vocal speech, such as the auditory cortex, are associated with the act of imitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3798">'''Tarka Sastra''' is a science of dialectics, logic and reasoning, and art of debate that analyzes the nature and source of knowledge and its validity. Sastra in [[Sanskrit]] means that which gives teaching, instruction or command. Tarka means debate or an argument. According to one reckoning, there are six sastras. Vyakarana is one of them. Four of the sastras are particularly important Vyakarana, Mimamsa, Tarka, and Vedanta.

The sastra has concepts called "[[purva paksha|poorva paksha]]" and "apara paksha". When one raises a point (poorva paksha) the other one criticizes it (apara paksha). Then the debate starts. Each one tries to support his point of view by getting various references. The meaning of the word tarka also is specific, in that it does not imply a pure logical analysis but a complex activity of discourse guided by strict definitions and goals so as to have. This concept is referred in [[Bhagawad Gita]] as "vAdaH pravadatAmasmi" (vibhooti yOga).

Tarkasamgraha which is the foundational text of logic and discourse was al the text followed as a Guidelines for discourses. Tarka may be translated as "hypothetical argument." Tarka is the process of questioning and cross-questioning that leads to a particular conclusion. It is a form of supposition that can be used as an aid to the attainment of valid knowledge.

There are several scholars well-versed in Tarka Sastras – [[Adi Shankara]] (788-820 CE), Ramanujacharya,Madhwacharya, [[Uddyotakara|Uddyotkar]] (Nyayavartik, 6th-7th century), [[Vācaspati Miśra]] (Tatparyatika, 9th century), [[Udayanacharya]] (Tatparyaparishuddhi, 10th century), [[Jayanta Bhatta]] (Nyayamanjari, 9th century), Vishwanath (Nyayasutravrtti, 17th century), and Radhamohan Goswami (Nyayasutravivaran, 18th century), [[Kumaran Asan]]. [[Paruthiyur Krishna Sastri]] and [[Sengalipuram Anantarama Dikshitar]] were specialized in Vyakarana, Mimamsa and Tarka Sastra. Also, Krishna Sastri excelled all those scholars of his contemporary period in Tarka Sastra.

'''''The Chariton Collector'''''  was a [[local history]] and [[folklore]] magazine published biannually between 1980 and 1989 by students at [[Kirksville High School]], [[Kirksville, Missouri]]. The magazine took its name from the [[Chariton River]], which flows through northeast Missouri.

==The beginnings==
In Fall of 1979 a new class, Local History, was offered as an elective at Kirksville High School under the direction of Mrs. Carol Trowbridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.truman.edu/scpublications/Chariton%20Collector/main.asp|title=The Chariton Collector|publisher=Pickler Memorial Library, Truman State University|year=2006|accessdate=2011-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of standard textbook instruction Mrs. Trowbridge envisioned an interactive learning experience where students would collect oral histories from the people of [[Adair County, Missouri|Adair County]] and the larger northeast Missouri area. This was inspired by the success of the ''[[Foxfire (magazine)|Foxfire]]'' books and magazines along with an increased interest in local history brought about by the [[United States Bicentennial|U.S. Bicentennial]]. In the summer of 1980, realizing that the stories written and interviews conducted during the class year should be preserved and published for the general public to enjoy, Mrs. Trowbridge and student volunteers compiled and edited the first issue of ''The Chariton Collector'', which was released in Fall, 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=

==A decade of success==
From the first issue the general public greeted ''The Chariton Collector'' with eagerness, all of the initial printing of 1,250 magazines selling out within a few weeks time.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} A change in leadership took place in Fall, 1982 as Mrs. Mary Grossnickle took over the renamed "Local and State History" class from the departing Mrs. Trowbridge. Operated on a non-profit basis, any proceeds from sales of ''Collector'' issues were used to fund the next issues printing as well as purchase supplies needed to fulfill the classes primary mission of recording and cataloging oral histories. Over a ten-year period a total of eighteen issues, comprising over 150 stories were published. Little-known or forgotten tales from the whimsical to the gruesome found their way into the pages of the ''Collector''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=
http://library.truman.edu/scpublications/Chariton%20Collector/editor's%20comments.asp|title=Editor's Comments|publisher=The Chariton Collector|date=Spring 1989|accessdate=2011-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; A typical issue might include the famous, like author [[Lester Dent]] and circus impresario [[William Preston Hall]], or the unknown like local basket weavers and former residents of a coal mining camp.

==Premature demise==
In the late 1980s the Kirksville R-III school district was facing substantial budget shortfalls, necessitating cutbacks in various classes, programs, and extracurricular activities. Despite the fact that ''The Chariton Collector'' was largely self-funded, the class responsible for its publication, now named "Missouri History", was removed from the elective offerings and the final issue of the ''Collector'' published in Spring, 1989. Thanks to the internet and the work of Ms. Katherine Goodwin, a student at [[Truman State University]], ''The Chariton Collector'' experienced a rebirth of sorts in 2006. All stories and photographs from each of the eighteen issues were scanned and placed online for free use by the general public via the website of Truman State's Pickler Memorial Library. Additionally, Kirksville High School donated interview tapes, transcripts, and photographs associated with ''The Chariton Collector'' to Pickler Libraries' Special Collections department. Rare copies of the ''Collector'' can sometimes be found for sale online or at public auctions, but always for many times the original cover price.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6434">'''The Word and the World Project''' of the [[Stanford University]]'s [[Stanford Learning Lab|Learning Lab]] developed a large lecture, Introduction to Humanities (IHUM) course adopting pedagogical strategies and technologies designed to enhance learning. The course was given in 1997 and 1998.  The goal of the curriculum innovations was to transform a large lecture course into a learning community.  Professors: [[Larry Friedlander]] (English), [[Haun Saussy]] (East Asian Studies), and [[Tim Lenior]] (History); teaching fellows: [[Carlos Seligo]] and [[Margo Denman]] and lab staff: [[Charles Kerns]] and [[George Toye]] worked together to develop a holistic curriculum mediated through a website center for the course.

==Problems in Large Lecture Courses==
This course was developed in response to the shortcomings of earlier large lecture courses. This type of course typically rated poorly in student evaluations and often led students to behaviors that inhibited learning: students skipped lectures and did not read assignments or prepare for meetings; students crammed for exams and waited until the last minute to write papers with a focus on grades and not learning. They were passive participants in a system that did not foster active engagement. Often there was a lack of continuity between lecture and section. Students had widely varying levels of knowledge about the texts. Faculty had very little information about the students’ knowledge as the course proceeded and the students had little feedback on their performance.

==Course Design==
The curriculum was based on the reading of five texts, [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], [[Blade Runner]], [[Hamlet]], [[Descartes]]' [[Meditations on First Philosophy|Meditations]], from the viewpoint of the scholar of history, literature, or philosophy. The course emphasized methods of reading and critical and interpretive approaches, rather than content.
 
This first year course met weekly in two one-hour lectures for all 100 students and two one-hour discussion section meetings of 15 students each. Students and instructors engaged in web activities including structured reading assignments and asynchronous discussion forums. The web site provided rich resources to supplement the texts. Students worked cross-section group projects and on panel discussions.  There was no final exam for the course; a fair was held in which students exhibited their project web sites.

==Technology==
[[File:WWAnnouncements.png|thumb|Course Web Site Home Page with Announcements]]
*Central Course Web Site
A site that had a calendar, announcements, faculty bios, the asynchronous discussion forums, assignments, and student projects

[[File:WWGenesis maps.png|thumb|Web Site Genesis Material]]
*Rich Web Resources
The course web site linked rich resources supporting each text to engage students from novices to those well-informed on the texts. It included explanatory information, annotations, cultural information, critical analyses, visual interpretations of the texts including paintings, video recordings of multiple performances, and different cuts of the films.

[[File:WWHamletAssignment answers.png|thumb|Web Reading Assignment]]
*Structured Readings
The web site also had a series of on-line assignments that structured the learners’ reading activities. These on-line activities drew upon the students’ previous knowledge and guided them as they approached each text. In the first year of the project in 1997 students responses were recorded in a personal on-line, shareable portfolio, but after noting little use of the portfolio, the design was changed in the second iteration of the course in 1998 so that assignments were displayed directly in the discussion Forum.

* The Forum 
The Forum had special features to support large lecture courses such as photographs of the posting student next to his/her message, organization into sections, and notification systems to alert faculty and groups to special postings. The forum was used to discuss lectures; it was where assignments were posted (they were not sent to an instructor); and was used for communication in forming project groups.The Forum was enhanced in the second year to allow direct linkage to assignments, faculty-controlled subject organization, and threaded discussion.

* Student Project Web Sites 
The students in the course completed projects in the second half of the course that demonstrated their understanding of the texts. Projects were constructed in many media the first year but were limited to posters and web sites in the second. Faculty met often with students helping them to plan their projects. All projects from the previous year were available as models when the course was repeated.

* Evaluation
The project employed several modes of project and technology evaluation: questionnaires, interviews, video interaction analysis, peer review, and ethnographic studies. Findings:

-The Forum provided a venue for discussion by quiet students and accommodated different learning styles.
-The Forum and assignments helped students prepare for face-to-face meetings by discussing basic issues before class. 
-It added to workload of teaching staff.
-There was a positive correlation between scores on papers and number of Forum postings.

'''The Law of Conservation of Misery''' is a [[folk wisdom]] that states that the total amount of [[wikt:misery|misery]] in a system is constant.

This implies that when you try to decrease the misery in one aspect of a system, you will increase the misery in some of the other aspects. In other words, for each problem you solve, at least one new problem is created, or as many new problems that together equal the trouble caused by the original problem. This law has particular significance in the realm of fantasy football, where one person's misery appears to correlate inversely with another person's happiness.  &lt;ref&gt;Dealing with Dilemmas, [[Frank Buytendijk]], 2010, Wiley &amp; Sons, {{ISBN|0470630310}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hertzfeld|first=Andy|title=Revolution in the valley|year=2005|publisher=O'Reilly|location=Sebastapol, Calif.|isbn=0-596-00719-1|pages=88|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tourism''' is [[travel]] for pleasure or business; also the theory and practice of touring, the business of attracting, accommodating, and entertaining tourists, and the business of operating tours.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|tourism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tourism may be international, or within the traveller's country. The [[World Tourism Organization]] defines tourism more generally, in terms which go "beyond the common perception of tourism as being limited to holiday activity only", as people "traveling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure and not less than 24 hours, business and other purposes".&lt;ref name="unwto1034"&gt;{{cite web|year=1995 |url=http://pub.unwto.org/WebRoot/Store/Shops/Infoshop/Products/1034/1034-1.pdf |title=UNWTO technical manual: Collection of Tourism Expenditure Statistics |page=10 |publisher=World Tourism Organization |access-date=26 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100922120940/http://pub.unwto.org/WebRoot/Store/Shops/Infoshop/Products/1034/1034-1.pdf |archivedate=22 September 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tourism can be domestic or international, and international tourism has both incoming and outgoing implications on a country's [[balance of payments]]. Today, tourism is a major source of income for many countries, and affects the economy of both the source and host countries, in some cases being of vital importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://journal.georgetown.edu/the-growing-importance-of-tourism-in-the-global-economy-and-international-affairs/|title=The Growing Importance of Tourism in the Global Economy and International Affairs {{!}}|website=journal.georgetown.edu|language=en-US|access-date=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tourism suffered as a result of a strong economic slowdown of the [[late-2000s recession]], between the second half of 2008 and the end of 2009, and the outbreak of the [[2009 flu pandemic|H1N1 influenza virus]],&lt;ref name=Barom2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=WTOaugust10/&gt; but slowly recovered. International tourism receipts (the travel item in the [[balance of payments]]) grew to {{USD|1.03}} trillion ({{euro|740}} billion) in 2011, corresponding to an increase in [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|real terms]] of 3.8% from 2010.&lt;ref name="pr12027"/&gt; International tourist arrivals surpassed the milestone of 1 billion tourists globally for the first time in 2012,&lt;ref name=Barom2012/&gt; [[emerging markets]] such as [[China]], [[Russia]], and [[Brazil]] had significantly increased their spending over the previous decade.&lt;ref name="Barom201304"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.unwto.org/en/press-release/2013-04-04/china-new-number-one-tourism-source-market-world |title=China – the new number one tourism source market in the world|publisher=[[World Tourism Organization]]|date=4 April 2013|accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ITB Berlin]] is the world's leading tourism [[trade fair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ITB Berlin: The World's Leading Travel Trade Show|url=http://www.expodatabase.com/tradeshow/itb-berlin-the-worlds-leading-travel-trade-show-908.html|website=www.expodatabase.com|publisher=M+A Expo Database|accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Global tourism accounts for ca. 8% of global [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.&lt;ref&gt;Lenzen et al.

==Etymology==
[[File:Vysoké Tatry r.1922.jpg|thumb|1922 postcard of tourists in the [[High Tatras]], [[Slovakia]].]]

The word ''tourist'' was used in 1772&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Griffiths|first1=Ralph|authorlink1=Ralph Griffiths|author2=Griffiths, G. E. |title=Pennant's Tour in Scotland in 1769|journal=[[Monthly Review (London)|The Monthly Review, Or, Literary Journal]]|year=1772|volume=46|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xS8oAAAAYAAJ&amp;vq=tourist&amp;dq=tourist&amp;pg=PA150|accessdate=23 December 2011|location=London|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''tourism'' in 1811.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=tour&amp;searchmode=none|title=tour (n.)|first1=Douglas|last1=Harper|authorlink1=Douglas Harper|work=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]|accessdate=23 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is formed from the word ''tour'', which is derived from Old English ''turian'', from Old French ''torner'', from Latin ''tornare''; 'to turn on a lathe,' which is itself from Ancient Greek ''tornos'' (τόρνος); 'lathe'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=turn&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|website=etymonline.com|access-date=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance of tourism==

Not only does the service sector grow thanks to tourism, but also local [[Craft|manufacturers]] (like those producing the strandkorb chairs), [[retail]]ers, the [[Real estate development|real-estate sector]] and the general [[City marketing|image of a location]] can benefit.]]

Tourism has become an important, even vital, source of income for many regions and even entire countries. The ''Manila Declaration on World Tourism of 1980'' recognized its importance as "an activity essential to the life of nations because of its direct effects on the social, cultural, educational, and economic sectors of national societies and on their international relations."&lt;ref name="unwto1034"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url= http://www.univeur.org/cuebc/downloads/PDF%20carte/65.%20Manila.PDF |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121120180003/http://www.univeur.org/CMS/UserFiles/65.%20Manila.PDF |archivedate= 20 November 2012 |title=  Manila Declaration on World Tourism |date= 10 October 1980|pages= 1–4|location= [[Manila]], [[Philippines]] |conference= World Tourism Conference}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tourism brings large amounts of income into a local economy in the form of payment for [[goods and services]] needed by tourists, accounting {{as of | 2011 | lc = on}} for 30% of the world's [[trade]] in services, and for 6% of overall [[export]]s of goods and services.&lt;ref name="pr12027"/&gt; It also generates opportunities for [[employment]] in the [[Tertiary sector of the economy|service sector of the economy]] associated with tourism.&lt;ref name="WTO2012Highlights"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://mkt.unwto.org/sites/all/files/docpdf/unwtohighlights12enlr_1.pdf |title= 2012 Tourism Highlights |publisher= UNWTO |accessdate= 17 June 2012 |date= June 2012 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120709215809/http://mkt.unwto.org/sites/all/files/docpdf/unwtohighlights12enlr_1.pdf |archivedate= 9 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hospitality industries which benefit from tourism include [[transport |transportation services]] (such as [[airline]]s, [[cruise ship]]s, [[train]]s and [[taxicab]]s); [[hospitality service]]s (such as [[lodging|accommodations]], including [[hotel]]s and [[resort]]s); and entertainment venues (such as [[amusement park]]s, [[restaurant]]s, [[casino]]s, [[shopping mall]]s, [[music venue]]s, and [[theatre|theaters]]). This is in addition to goods bought by tourists, including [[souvenir]]s.

On the flip-side, tourism can degrade people and sour relationships between host and guest.&lt;ref&gt;

| quote = The globalisation of tourism has partially exacerbated the relationships of inequality and subservience that are so commonplace in host-guest encounters. It is not simply enough for local people to accept their role as servants, guides or companions to a range of ever-changing tourists. They are also confronted increasingly by the luxurious global products of Western indulgence which remain far from their reach, rather like the thirsty Tantalus in his elusive pool of water.

==Definitions==
In 1936, the [[League of Nations]] defined a ''foreign tourist'' as "someone traveling abroad for at least twenty-four hours". Its successor, the [[United Nations]], amended this definition in 1945, by including a maximum stay of six months.&lt;ref name="theobald"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9dvK2ajv7zIC&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;dq=league%20of%20nations%20tourism%201936&amp;pg=PA6#v=onepage&amp;q=league%20of%20nations%20tourism%201936|title=Global Tourism|last=Theobald|first=William F.|publisher=[[Butterworth–Heinemann]]|year=1998|isbn=978-0-7506-4022-0|edition= 2nd|location=Oxford [England]|pages=6–7|oclc=40330075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, Hunziker and Kraft defined tourism as "the sum of the phenomena and relationships arising from the travel and stay of non-residents, insofar as they do not lead to [[Permanent residency|permanent residence]] and are not connected with any earning activity."&lt;ref name="1941define"&gt;{{cite book|title=Grundriß Der Allgemeinen Fremdenverkehrslehre|last1=Hunziker |first1=W|authorlink1=Walter Hunziker|last2=Krapf|first2=K|oclc=180109383|publisher=Polygr.

It includes movements for all purposes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beaver|first=Allan|title=A Dictionary of Travel and Tourism Terminology|year=2002|publisher=CAB International|isbn=978-0-85199-582-3|page=313|location=Wallingford |oclc=301675778}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, the International Association of Scientific Experts in Tourism defined tourism in terms of particular activities chosen and undertaken outside the home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The AIEST, its character and aims|url=http://www.aiest.org/org/idt/idt_aiest.nsf/en/index.html|author=International Association of Scientific Experts in Tourism|accessdate=29 March 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111126143828/http://www.aiest.org/org/idt/idt_aiest.nsf/en/index.html|archivedate=26 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, the [[United Nations]] identified three forms of tourism in its ''Recommendations on Tourism Statistics'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|date=|year=1994|title=Recommendations on Tourism Statistics|url=https://unstats.un.org/unsd/newsletter/unsd_workshops/tourism/st_esa_stat_ser_M_83.pdf|journal=|series=M|location=New York|volume=|issue=83|page=5|pages=|work=Statistical Papers|accessdate=12 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Domestic tourism, involving residents of the given country traveling only within this country
* Inbound tourism, involving non-residents traveling in the given country
* Outbound tourism, involving residents traveling in another country

The terms ''tourism'' and ''travel'' are sometimes used interchangeably. In this context, travel has a similar definition to tourism, but implies a more purposeful journey. The terms ''tourism'' and ''tourist'' are sometimes used pejoratively, to imply a shallow interest in the cultures or locations visited. By contrast, ''traveler'' is often used as a sign of distinction. The sociology of tourism has studied the cultural values underpinning these distinctions and their implications for class relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Tourists_at_the_Taj.html?id=YjLxR2H-YCYC|title=Tourists at the Taj: Performance and Meaning at a Symbolic Site|last=Edensor|first=Tim|date=1 January 1998|publisher=Psychology Press|year=|isbn=9780415167123|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antiquity===
{{see also|Travel literature}}
Travel outside a person's local area for leisure was largely confined to wealthy classes, who at times traveled to distant parts of the world, to see great buildings and works of art, [[multilingualism|learn new languages]], experience new cultures, and to taste different [[cuisine]]s. As early as [[Shulgi]], however, kings praised themselves for protecting roads and building way stations for travelers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HFWjoeVCLk0C|title=Introduction To Tourism|last=Jayapalan|first=N.|date=1 January 2001|publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Dist|isbn=9788171569779|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Travelling for pleasure can be seen in [[Egypt]] as early on as 1500 B.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Casson|first1=Lionel|title=Travel in the Ancient World|date=1994|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Roman Republic]], [[spa]]s and coastal resorts such as [[Baiae]] were popular among the rich. [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] wrote his ''Description of Greece'' in the 2nd century AD. In [[ancient China]], nobles sometimes made a point of visiting [[Mount Tai]] and, on occasion, all [[five Sacred Mountains]].

===Middle Ages===
By the [[Middle Ages]], [[Christian pilgrimage|Christianity]] and [[Buddhist pilgrimage|Buddhism]] had traditions of [[pilgrimage]]. [[Chaucer]]'s [[Canterbury Tales]] and [[Wu Cheng'en]]'s ''[[Journey to the West]]'' remain classics of [[English literature|English]] and [[Chinese literature]].

The 10th- to 13th-century [[Song dynasty]] also saw secular [[travel literature|travel writers]] such as [[Su Shi]] (11th century) and [[Fan Chengda]] (12th century) become popular in [[China]]. Under the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]], [[Xu Xiake]] continued the practice.&lt;ref&gt;Hargett, James. "Some Preliminary Remarks on the Travel Records of the Song Dynasty (960-1279)" in ''Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews'', {{nowrap|Vol. 7}}, {{nowrap|No. 1/2}}, {{nowrap|pp. 67–93}}. 1985. {{doi|10.2307/495194}}. {{JSTOR|495194}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[medieval Italy]], [[Francesco Petrarch]] also wrote an allegorical account of his 1336 ascent of [[Mount Ventoux]] that praised the act of traveling and criticized ''frigida incuriositas'' ("cold lack of curiosity"). The [[Duke of Burgundy|Burgundian]] poet {{Interlanguage link multi|Michault Taillevent|fr}} later composed his own horrified recollections of a 1430 trip through the [[Jura Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7yqsIYSNmLMC&amp;pg=PA32 | title=Un poète bourguignon du XVe siècle, Michault Taillevent: édition et étude | publisher=Librairie Droz |author1=Deschaux, Robert |author2=Taillevent, Michault | year=1975 | pages=31–32| isbn=9782600028318 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grand Tour===
[[File:Willem van Haecht Władysław Vasa.JPG|thumb|Prince Ladislaus Sigismund of Poland visiting Gallery of [[Cornelis van der Geest]] in [[Brussels]] in 1624.]]
{{See also|Grand Tour}}
Modern tourism can be traced to what was known as the [[Grand Tour]], which was a traditional trip around [[Europe]] (especially [[Germany]] and [[Italy]]), undertaken by mainly [[Upper class|upper-class]] European young men of means, mainly from Western and Northern European countries. In 1624, young Prince of [[Poland]], [[Władysław IV Vasa|Ladislaus Sigismund Vasa]], the eldest son and heir of [[Sigismund III Vasa|Sigismund III]], embarked for a journey across Europe, as was in [[Norm (sociology)|custom]] among Polish nobility.&lt;ref name="wladcy12b"&gt;[[Tomasz Bohun]], ''Podróże po Europie'', ''Władysław IV Wasa'', Władcy Polski, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; He travelled through territories of today's Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, where he admired the [[Siege of Breda (1624)|Siege of Breda]] by Spanish forces, France, Switzerland to Italy, Austria, and the [[Czech Republic]].&lt;ref name="wladcy12b"/&gt; It was an educational journey&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Adam Kucharski |title=Dyplomacja i turystyka&amp;nbsp;– królewicz Władysław Waza w posiadłościach hiszpańskich (1624–1625)|url=http://www.wilanow-palac.art.pl/dyplomacja_i_turystyka_krolewicz_wladyslaw_waza_w_posiadlosciach_hiszpanskich_1624_1625.html |work=Silva Rerum |accessdate=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the outcomes was introduction of [[Polish opera|Italian opera]] in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]].&lt;ref&gt;’’The Oxford Illustrated History of Opera’’, ed. Roger Parker (1994): chapter on Central and Eastern European opera by John Warrack, p. 240; ‘’The Viking Opera Guide’’, ed. Amanda Holden (1993): articles on Polish composers, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;

The custom flourished from about 1660 until the advent of large-scale [[rail transport|rail]] transit in the 1840s, and generally followed a standard [[Travel itinerary|itinerary]]. It was an educational opportunity and [[rite of passage]]. Though primarily associated with the [[British nobility]] and wealthy [[landed gentry]], similar trips were made by wealthy young men of [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Northern Europe]]an nations on the [[Continental Europe|Continent]], and from the second half of the 18th century some South American, US, and other overseas youth joined in. The tradition was extended to include more of the [[middle class]] after rail and steamship travel made the journey easier, and [[Thomas Cook &amp; Son|Thomas Cook]] made the "Cook's Tour" a byword.

The Grand Tour became a real status symbol for upper class students in the 18th and 19th centuries. In this period, Johann Joachim Winckelmann's theories about the supremacy of classic culture became very popular and appreciated in the European academic world. Artists, writers and travellers (such as [[Goethe]]) affirmed the supremacy of classic art of which Italy, France and Greece provide excellent examples. For these reasons, the Grand Tour's main destinations were to those centres, where upper-class students could find rare examples of classic art and history.

''[[The New York Times]]'' recently described the Grand Tour in this way:

{{Quote|text=Three hundred years ago, wealthy young Englishmen began taking a post-[[Oxbridge]] trek through France and Italy in search of art, culture and the roots of [[Western culture|Western civilization]]. With nearly unlimited funds, aristocratic connections and months (or years) to roam, they [[Commission (art)|commissioned paintings]], perfected their language skills and mingled with the upper crust of the Continent.|sign=Gross, Matt.|source=[http://frugaltraveler.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/05/lesons-from-the-frugal-grand-tour/index.html Lessons From the Frugal Grand Tour]." ''New York Times'' 5 September 2008.}}

The primary value of the Grand Tour, it was believed, laid in the exposure both to the cultural legacy of [[classical antiquity]] and the [[Renaissance]], and to the aristocratic and fashionably polite society of the European continent.

===Emergence of leisure travel===
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2013}}
[[File:Carl Spitzweg 047.jpg|thumb|''Englishman in the [[Roman Campagna|Campagna]]'' by [[Carl Spitzweg]] (c. 1845)]]

[[Leisure]] travel was associated with the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the [[United Kingdom]]{{spaced ndash}}the first European country to promote leisure time to the increasing industrial population.&lt;ref name="singh"&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=L. K.|title=Fundamental of Tourism and Travel|year=2008|publisher=Isha Books|location=Delhi|isbn=978-81-8205-478-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mWf4PtzRmwUC&amp;lpg=PA189&amp;dq=the%20first%20European%20country%20to%20promote%20leisure%20time%20to%20the%20increasing%20industrial%20population&amp;pg=PA189|page=189|chapter=Issues in Tourism Industry}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, this applied to the owners of the machinery of production, the economic oligarchy, factory owners and traders. These comprised the new [[middle class]].&lt;ref name="singh"/&gt; [[Cox &amp; Kings]] was the first official travel company to be formed in 1758.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coxandkings.co.uk/aboutus-history.aspx|title=History: Centuries of Experience|publisher=[[Cox &amp; Kings]]|accessdate=23 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British origin of this new industry is reflected in many place names. In [[Nice]], France, one of the first and best-established holiday resorts on the [[French Riviera]], the long esplanade along the seafront is known to this day as the ''[[Promenade des Anglais]]''; in many other historic resorts in [[continental Europe]], old, well-established palace hotels have names like the ''[[Hotel Bristol]]'', ''Hotel Carlton'', or ''Hotel Majestic''{{spaced ndash}}reflecting the dominance of English customers.

[[File:Thomas Cook Building, Leicester, panels.jpg|thumb|Panels from the Thomas Cook Building in Leicester, displaying excursions offered by [[Thomas Cook]]]]
[[File:Leicester Rail Station - geograph.org.uk - 1266728.jpg|left|thumb|[[Leicester railway station]] – built in 1894 to replace, largely on the same site, [[Leicester Campbell Street railway station|Campbell Street station]], the origin for many of Cook's early tours.]]
A pioneer of the travel agency business, [[Thomas Cook]]'s idea to offer excursions came to him while waiting for the stagecoach on the London Road at [[Kibworth]]. With the opening of the extended [[Midland Counties Railway]], he arranged to take a group of 540 [[Temperance Movement|temperance campaigners]] from [[Leicester]] [[Leicester Campbell Street railway station|Campbell Street station]] to a rally in [[Loughborough]], {{convert|11|mi|km|spell=in}} away. On 5 July 1841, Thomas Cook arranged for the rail company to charge one [[shilling]] per person; this included rail tickets and food for the journey. Cook was paid a share of the fares charged to the passengers, as the railway tickets, being legal contracts between company and passenger, could not have been issued at his own price.{{clarify|date=April 2017}} This was the first privately chartered [[excursion train]] to be advertised to the general public; Cook himself acknowledged that there had been previous, unadvertised, private excursion trains.&lt;ref&gt;Ingle, R., 1991 ''Thomas Cook of Leicester'', Bangor, Headstart History&lt;/ref&gt; During the following three summers he planned and conducted outings for temperance societies and [[Sunday school]] children. In 1844 the Midland Counties Railway Company agreed to make a permanent arrangement with him, provided he found the passengers. This success led him to start his own business running rail excursions for pleasure, taking a percentage of the railway fares.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thomascook.com/thomas-cook-history/|title=Thomas Cook History|website=www.thomascook.com|access-date=12 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1855, he planned his first excursion abroad, when he took a group from Leicester to [[Calais]] to coincide with the [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|Paris Exhibition]]. The following year he started his "grand circular tours" of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thomascook.com/thomas-cook-history/key-dates/|title=Key Dates 1841–2014 {{!}} Thomas Cook|website=www.thomascook.com|access-date=12 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1860s he took parties to Switzerland, Italy, Egypt and the United States. Cook established "inclusive independent travel", whereby the traveller went independently but his agency charged for travel, food and accommodation for a fixed period over any chosen route. Such was his success that the Scottish railway companies withdrew their support between 1862 and 1863 to try the excursion business for themselves.

[[File:Prinzessin Victoria Luise LOC det.4a15439.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Prinzessin Victoria Luise]], the first [[cruise ship]] of the world, launched in June 1900 in [[Hamburg]] (Germany)]]
Cruising is a popular form of [[water tourism]].
Leisure [[cruise ship]]s were introduced by the ''[[Peninsular &amp; Oriental Steam Navigation Company]]'' (P&amp;O) in 1844, sailing from [[Southampton]] to destinations such as [[Gibraltar]], [[Malta]] and [[Athens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.btnews.co.uk/article/5037|title=CRUISE NEWS JUNE 2012|accessdate=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1891, German businessman [[Albert Ballin]] sailed the ship [[Augusta Victoria (ship)|''Augusta Victoria'']] from [[Hamburg]] into the Mediterranean Sea. June 29, 1900 saw the launching of the first purpose-built cruise ship was ''[[Prinzessin Victoria Luise]]'', built in Hamburg for the Hamburg America Line.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cruiselinehistory.com/the-prinzessin-victoria-luise-worlds-first-cruise-ship/|title=The Prinzessin Victoria Luise – world’s first cruise ship.|work=CRUISING THE PAST|access-date=2018-08-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many leisure-oriented tourists travel to [[seaside resort]]s on their nearest coast or further afield. Coastal areas in the tropics are popular in both summer and winter.

Academics have defined mass tourism as travel by groups on pre-scheduled tours, usually under the organization of tourism professionals.&lt;ref&gt;Golden Age of Mass Tourism: Its History and Development, Erkan Sezgin and Medet Yolal, [[Anadolu University]], p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; This form of tourism developed during the second half of the 19th century in the [[United Kingdom]] and was pioneered by [[Thomas Cook]]. Cook took advantage of Europe's rapidly expanding railway network and established a company that offered affordable day trip excursions to [[the masses]], in addition to longer holidays to Continental Europe, India, Asia and the Western Hemisphere which attracted wealthier customers. By the 1890s over 20,000 tourists per year used [[Thomas Cook &amp; Son]].&lt;ref name="Mass Tourism p. 74"&gt;Golden Age of Mass Tourism: Its History and Development, Erkan Sezgin and Medet Yolal, [[Anadolu University]], p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between tourism companies, transportation operators and hotels is a central feature of mass tourism. Cook was able to offer prices that were below the publicly advertised price because his company purchased large numbers of tickets from railroads.&lt;ref name="Mass Tourism p. 74"/&gt; One contemporary form of mass tourism, [[package tour]]ism, still incorporates the partnership between these three groups.

Travel developed during the early 20th century and was facilitated by the development of the automobiles and later by airplanes.
Improvements in transport allowed many people to travel quickly to places of leisure interest, so that more people could begin to enjoy the benefits of leisure time.

In [[Continental Europe]], early [[seaside resort]]s included: [[Heiligendamm]], founded in 1793 at the [[Baltic Sea]], being the first seaside resort; [[Ostend]], popularised by the people of [[Brussels]]; [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]] and [[Deauville]] for the [[Paris]]ians; [[Taormina]] in [[Sicily]]. In the [[United States]], the first seaside resorts in the European style were at [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]], [[New Jersey]] and [[Long Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]].

By the mid-20th century the Mediterranean Coast became the principal mass tourism destination. The 1960s and 1970s saw mass tourism play a major role in the [[Spanish miracle#Mass tourism and emigration|Spanish economic "miracle"]].

===Niche tourism===
{{main list|List of adjectival tourisms}}
[[File:Cristo Rei (36211699613).jpg|thumb|right|The [[Christ the King (Almada)|Sanctuary of Christ the King]], in [[Almada]], has become one of the most religious tourism visited places.]]

Niche tourism refers to the numerous specialty forms of tourism that have emerged over the years, each with its own adjective. Many of these terms have come into common use by the tourism industry and academics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lew|first=Alan A.|title=Long Tail Tourism: New geographies for marketing niche tourism products|journal=Journal of Travel &amp; Tourism Marketing|year=2008|volume=25|issue=3–4|pages=409–19|doi=10.1080/10548400802508515|url=http://www.geog.nau.edu/publications/Long-Tail-Tourism-Lew.pdf|accessdate=22 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100614084130/http://www.geog.nau.edu/publications/Long-Tail-Tourism-Lew.pdf|archivedate=14 June 2010|df=dmy-all|citeseerx=10.1.1.467.6320}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others are emerging concepts that may or may not gain popular usage. Examples of the more common niche tourism markets are:
{{colbegin}}
* [[Agritourism]]
* [[Birth tourism]]
* [[Culinary tourism]]
* [[Cultural tourism]]
* [[Dark tourism]] (also called "black tourism" or "grief tourism") 
* [[Eco tourism]]
* [[Extreme tourism]]
* [[Geotourism]]
* [[Heritage tourism]]
* [[LGBT tourism]]
* [[Medical tourism]]
* [[Movie tourism]]
* [[Nautical tourism]]
* [[Pop-culture tourism]]
* [[Religious tourism]]
* [[Sex tourism]]
* [[Slum tourism]]
* [[Sports tourism]]
* [[Virtual tourism]]
* [[War tourism]]
* [[Wellness tourism]]
* [[Wildlife tourism]]
{{colend}}

Other terms used for niche or specialty travel forms include the term "destination" in the descriptions, such as [[destination wedding]]s, and terms such as [[location vacation]].

===Winter tourism===
{{See also|List of ski areas and resorts|Winter sport}}
[[St. Moritz]], [[Switzerland]] became the cradle of the developing winter tourism in the 1860s: hotel manager Johannes Badrutt invited some summer guests from England to return in the winter to see the snowy landscape, thereby inaugurating a popular trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stmoritz.ch/en/winter/village/spirit-history/birthplace-of-winter-tourism.html|title=Birthplace of winter tourism|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017122131/http://www.stmoritz.ch/en/winter/village/spirit-history/birthplace-of-winter-tourism.html|archivedate=17 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Early Winter Tourism|url=http://www.kulmhotel-stmoritz.ch/en/portrait/tradition-history/early-winter-tourism.html|work=Tradition &amp; History|publisher=Kulm Hotel|accessdate=23 December 2011|location=[[St. Moritz]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219230025/http://www.kulmhotel-stmoritz.ch/en/portrait/tradition-history/early-winter-tourism.html|archivedate=19 December 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was, however, only in the 1970s when winter tourism took over the lead from summer tourism in many of the Swiss ski resorts. Even in winter, up to one third of all guests (depending on the location) consist of non-skiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.graubuenden.ch/winter-walking-switzerland.html |title=Winter hiking in Switzerland-Graubünden|publisher=graubuenden.ch |accessdate=23 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major [[ski resort]]s are located mostly in the various European countries (e.g. [[Andorra]], [[Austria]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]], [[Croatia]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Cyprus]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], Greece, [[Iceland]], [[Italy]], [[Norway]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[List of ski areas and resorts in Europe#Poland|Poland]], [[Romania]], [[Serbia]], [[Sweden]], [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Spain]], [[Switzerland]], [[Turkey]]), [[Canada]], the [[United States]] (e.g. Montana, Utah, Colorado, California, Wyoming, Vermont, New Hampshire, New York) [[Argentina]], [[New Zealand]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], [[Chile]], and [[Lebanon]].

Some places that already have ski opportunities can also have glaciers in the area. Some of theses places already offer a glacier hike to see the glaciers in another way that they can. One of these places are New Zealand. New Zealand has several glaciers that are available for this experience. The Franz Josef is one of these glaciers that tourism is available. The only way to get to the glacier is via a helicopter. Before helicopters were invented the way that people were able to get up to the glacier was by hiking up to the glacier. The companies have to make sure that people are safe from when they are on the glacier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Purdie|first=Heather|date=1 November 2013|title=Glacier Retreat and Tourism: Insights from New Zealand|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/10.1659/MRD-JOURNAL-D-12-00073.1|journal=Mountain Research and Development|volume=33|issue=4|pages=463–472|doi=10.1659/MRD-JOURNAL-D-12-00073.1|issn=0276-4741}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would fall under environmental tourism as well as winter tourism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Recent developments==
[[File:Aerial view Yacht Harbour Residence Rostock Yachthafenresidenz Hohe Düne 6.jpg|thumb|right|A [[destination hotel]] in [[Germany]]: ''Yacht Harbour Residence'' in [[Warnemünde|Rostock]], [[Mecklenburg]].]]
[[File:Can you see the surfer? (33988985575).jpg|thumb|right|[[Nazaré, Portugal]], is now listed on the [[Guinness World Records]] for the biggest waves ever surfed and has become a worldwide tourist attraction.]]
There has been an up-trend in tourism over the last few decades,{{vague|date=November 2013}} especially in Europe, where international travel for short breaks is common. Tourists have a wide range of budgets and tastes, and a wide variety of resorts and hotels have developed to cater for them. For example, some people prefer simple beach vacations, while others want more specialised holidays, quieter resorts, family-oriented holidays, or niche market-targeted [[destination hotel]]s.

The developments in [[Aviation|air transport]] infrastructure, such as [[Wide-body aircraft|jumbo jets]], [[Low-cost carrier|low-cost airlines]], and more [[accessible tourism|accessible]] [[airport]]s have made many types of tourism more affordable. The [[WHO]] estimated in 2009 that there are around half a million people on board aircraft at any given time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/8477508 Swine flu prompts EU warning on travel to US]. ''The Guardian.'' 28 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been changes in lifestyle, for example some retirement-age people sustain year round tourism. This is facilitated by [[Electronic commerce|internet sales]] of tourist services. Some sites have now started to offer [[dynamic packaging]], in which an inclusive price is quoted for a tailor-made package requested by the customer upon impulse.

There have been a few setbacks in tourism, such as the [[September 11 attacks]] and [[terrorism|terrorist threats]] to [[tourist destination]]s, such as in [[Bali]] and several European cities. Also, on 26 December 2004, a [[tsunami]], caused by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]], hit the [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Asia|Asian countries]] on the [[Indian Ocean]], including the [[Maldives]]. Thousands of lives were lost including many tourists. This, together with the vast [[clean-up]] operations, stopped or severely hampered tourism in the area for a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://travelcupio.com/category/destination/asia-pacific/india/|title=India Top Tourist Destinations &amp; Attractions|website=TravelCupio|language=en-US|access-date=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual low-price or even zero-price overnight stays have become more popular in the 2000s, especially with a strong growth in the [[hostel]] market and services like [[CouchSurfing]] and [[airbnb]] being established.&lt;ref name="newyorkercouch"&gt;{{cite web|last=Marx|first=Patricia|title=Couch-surfing the globe|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/04/16/120416fa_fact_marx|publisher=The New Yorker|accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has also been examples of jurisdictions wherein a significant portion of GDP is being spent on altering the primary sources of revenue towards tourism, as has occurred for instance in [[Dubai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cadene|first1=Philippe|title=Atlas of the Gulf States|date=2013|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainable tourism===
{{Main|Sustainable tourism}}

"Sustainable tourism is envisaged as leading to management of all resources in such a way that economic, social and aesthetic needs can be fulfilled while maintaining cultural integrity, essential ecological processes, [[Biodiversity|biological diversity]] and life support systems." ([[World Tourism Organization]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sustainable Tourism: Turning the Tide |url=http://www.stakeholderforum.org/fileadmin/files/SF_Briefing_Papers/bp_tourism.pdf|work=Towards Earth Summit 2002|publisher=[[Stakeholder Forum for a Sustainable Future]]|access-date=22 January 2012|date=August 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sustainable development]] implies "meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs." ([[Bruntland Commission|World Commission on Environment and Development]], 1987)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Resolution adopted by the General Assembly|url=http://www.un-documents.net/a42r187.htm|work=42/187. Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development|publisher=[[The Conference of NGOs]]|access-date=21 January 2012|date=11 December 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important part of sustainable tourism is something known as the three pillars of sustainability which include Economic, Environmental/Ecological and Socio-cultural. For a destination to be truly sustainable it must have an equal balance which the three pillars. Economic is in relation to money and making and maintaining a certain amount of cash. Environmental is of course in relation to the environment it looks into whether the local ecosystems can support the influx of visitors and also how these visitors effect the ecosystem. Then finally Socio-cultural is about how well the culture of this area is able to maintain its traditions with the incoming tourists.  These pillars are important because they are the true key to being sustainable when discussing tourism.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Sustainable tourism can be seen as having regard to ecological and social-cultural carrying capacities and includes involving the community of the destination in tourism development planning (that was done e.g. in [[Fruška Gora]] National Park in [[Serbia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vujko|first=Aleksandra|last2=Plavša|first2=Jovan|last3=Petrović|first3=Marko|last4=Radovanović|first4=Milan|last5=Gajić|first5=Tamara|date=13 March 2017|title=Modelling of carrying capacity in National Park - Fruška Gora (Serbia) case study|url=https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/geo.2017.9.issue-1/issue-files/geo.2017.9.issue-1.xml|journal=Open Geosciences|volume=9|issue=1|pages=61–72|doi=10.1515/geo-2017-0005|issn=2391-5447|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;). It also involves integrating tourism to match current economic and growth policies so as to mitigate some of the negative economic and social [[impacts of tourism|impacts]] of '[[mass tourism]]'. Murphy (1985) advocates the use of an 'ecological approach', to consider both 'plants' and 'people' when implementing the sustainable tourism development process. This is in contrast to the '[[boosterism]]' and '[[economic]]' approaches to tourism planning, neither of which consider the detrimental ecological or sociological impacts of tourism development to a destination.

However, Butler questions the exposition of the term 'sustainable' in the context of tourism, citing its ambiguity and stating that "the emerging sustainable development philosophy of the 1990s can be viewed as an extension of the broader realization that a preoccupation with economic growth without regard to its social and environmental consequences is self-defeating in the long term." Thus 'sustainable tourism development' is seldom considered as an autonomous function of economic regeneration as separate from general economic growth.

===Ecotourism===
{{Main|Ecotourism}}
Ecotourism, also known as ecological tourism, is responsible travel to fragile, pristine, and usually protected areas that strives to be low-impact and (often) small-scale. It helps educate the traveler; provides funds for conservation; directly benefits the economic development and political empowerment of local communities; and fosters respect for different cultures and for human rights.''Take only memories and leave only footprints'' is a very common slogan in protected areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pinterest.com/marymo393/take-only-memories-leave-only-footprints-chief-sea/|title=Morgan Gamble|work=Pinterest|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tourist destinations are shifting to low carbon emissions following the trend of visitors more focused in being environmentally responsible adopting a sustainable behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Entrepreneuring Sustainable Tourism, [[Jack Soifer]] Editor, Lisboa, 2008, {{ISBN|978-989-95976-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Movie tourism===
The movie tourism is a form of tourism for those who visit the film and television locations, ie the places used for filming a film or a television series. In addition to organized tours (and not) to film locations lately has widened the tendency to a type of tourism, linked to the cinema, which relates to events, conventions and more like the case of the [[Dizionario del Turismo Cinematografico]].

===Dizionario del Turismo Cinematografico===
The Dizionario del Turismo Cinematografico is an artistic costume movement originally born as a journalistic column on various online and paper publications officially in 2012 (with a genesis formed in the previous decade) but, in the following years, it has become a real costume fashion popularized in sites, associations, institutions, municipal administrations, political parties, movements and television listings all over the world. It also includes Museums and Sports Groups linked to its brand. The purpose of the work is varied: from the redevelopment of territorial areas thanks to the artistic interest raised to be film and fiction locations ([[Movie tourism]]) to promote events linked to the Cinema as film anniversaries, festivals, parties to theme (Toga Party, Monster Party, Cosplay Party, Hollywood Party, Pajamas Party, etc ...), manifestations born in films or that the cinema has helped to divulge (though already existing) as, for example, the Demolition Derby, village festivals disseminated by the Cinema (such as those appearing in the [[Mondo Cane]] film series, etc ...). We wanted to differentiate from Movie Tourism  (a fashion that has existed for several decades) to be more varied and not limited to tourism (that is a part of the Dizionario del Turismo Cinematografico).
In the mid-2000s, the student of video advertising and journalistic communications at the [[Turin]] branch of the Fellini Institute [[Davide Lingua]] (called Dave Lingua), obsessed with customary phenomena, has in mind to create a totally new object to redevelop areas territories hit by the crisis but fun and that leads to fashion accessible to all. This is the genesis for the creation of the Dizionario del Turismo Cinematografico. A few years later (between 2010, the beginning of the collaboration, and 2012) creates with this name a column (which initially deals with Cine tourism, Cinema Museums and Costume Party with a cinematic theme) within the site (in that period related to the homonymous paper magazine) of the Milan group [[Mondadori]] [[filmtv.it]] which soon became the most popular of the magazine with a myriad of collaborators. In the following period the Dizionario del Turismo Cinematografico appears as a column in various newspapers and magazines (the Netweek group, La Voce, is mentioned in [[La Stampa]] and many other newspapers) and officially appears as a cultural movement that gives full freedom to all to join simply using the Dizionario del Turismo Cinematografico (respecting however the topics of interest of the movement) coming to create totally independent sections (but always within legally registered bodies or associations), with their own statutes and directives but with only provided that the official founder (helped at the beginning by the first members) Davide Lingua is recognized as Permanent Director for life (in fact director and not president because he wants to underline the journalistic origin of the project).

From its birth until today the Dizionario del Turismo Cinematografico is a worldwide journalistic column, television broadcasting, has sections in many associations, institutions that collaborate with municipal administrations, has dealt with the official celebrations of film shooting anniversaries (for example [[Salasco]] of the film [[Bitter Rice]]), appears in the credits of many films for the collaboration given, organizes communication courses, cultural and sporting events, etc ...

===Volunteer tourism===

Volunteer tourism (or voluntourism) is growing as a largely Western phenomenon, with volunteers travelling to aid those less fortunate than themselves in order to counter global inequalities. Wearing (2001) defines volunteer tourism as applying “to those tourists who, for various reasons, volunteer in an organised way to undertake holidays that might involve aiding or alleviating the material poverty of some groups in society”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Volunteer Tourism: Experiences That Make a Difference|publisher=CABI}}&lt;/ref&gt; VSO was founded in the UK in 1958 and the US Peace Corps was subsequently founded in 1960. These were the first large scale voluntary sending organisations, initially arising to modernise less economically developed countries, which it was hoped would curb the influence of communism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Butcher|first=J|last2=Smith|first2=P|date=2010|title=‘Making a difference’: Volunteer tourism and development|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02508281.2010.11081616|journal=Tourism Recreation Research|volume=35|pages=27–36|doi=10.1080/02508281.2010.11081616}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This form of tourism is largely praised for its more sustainable approach to travel, with tourists attempting to assimilate into local cultures, and avoiding the criticisms of consumptive and exploitative mass tourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Terry|first=W|date=2014|title=Solving labor problems and building capacity unsustainable agriculture through volunteer tourism|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160738314001091|journal=Annals of Tourism Research|volume=49|pages=94–107|doi=10.1016/j.annals.2014.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, increasingly voluntourism is being criticised by scholars who suggest it may have negative effects as it begins to undermine local labour, and force unwilling host communities to adopt Western initiatives,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guttentag|first=D|date=2009|title=The possible negative impacts of volunteer tourism|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jtr.727/full|journal=International Journal of Tourism Research|volume=11|issue=6|pages=537–51|doi=10.1002/jtr.727}}&lt;/ref&gt; while host communities without a strong heritage fail to retain volunteers who become dissatisfied with experiences and volunteer shortages persist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Curran|first=Ross|last2=Taheri|first2=Babak|last3=MacIntosh|first3=Robert|last4=O'Gorman|first4=Kevin|date=2016|title=Nonprofit Brand Heritage: Its Ability to Influence Volunteer Retention, Engagement, and Satisfaction|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0899764016633532|journal=Nonprofit and Volutary Sector Quarterly|volume=45|issue=6|pages=1234–57|doi=10.1177/0899764016633532}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasingly organisations such as VSO have been concerned with community-centric volunteer programmes where power to control the future of the community is in the hands of local people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Jamie|last2=Curran|first2=Ross|last3=O'Gorman|first3=Kevin|date=2017|title=A modern day panopticon: Using power and control theory to manage volunteer tourists in Bolivia|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221197361730003X|journal=Tourism Management Perspectives|volume=22|pages=34–43|doi=10.1016/j.tmp.2017.01.003|hdl=10373/2606}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pro-poor tourism===

Pro-poor tourism, which seeks to help the poorest people in developing countries, has been receiving increasing attention by those involved in development; the issue has been addressed through small-scale projects in local communities and through attempts by Ministries of Tourism to attract large numbers of tourists. Research by the [[Overseas Development Institute]] suggests that neither is the best way to encourage tourists' money to reach the poorest as only 25% or less (far less in some cases) ever reaches the poor; successful examples of money reaching the poor include mountain-climbing in [[Tanzania]] and cultural tourism in [[Luang Prabang]], [[Laos]].&lt;ref name="odi.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=2675&amp;title=value-chains-tourism-poverty-reduction |title=Value chain analysis and poverty reduction at scale  |author=Jonathan Mitchel |year=2009 |publisher=Overseas Development Institute |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the possibility of pro-poor tourism principles being adopted in centre sites of regeneration in the developed world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Butler|first=Richard|last2=Curran|first2=Ross|last3=O'Gorman|first3=Kevin D.|date=1 September 2013|title=Pro-Poor Tourism in a First World Urban Setting: Case Study of Glasgow Govan|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jtr.1888/abstract|journal=International Journal of Tourism Research|language=en|volume=15|issue=5|pages=443–57|doi=10.1002/jtr.1888|issn=1522-1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recession tourism===
Recession tourism is a travel trend which evolved by way of the world economic crisis. Recession tourism is defined by low-cost and high-value experiences taking place of once-popular generic retreats. Various recession tourism hotspots have seen business boom during the recession thanks to comparatively low costs of living and a slow world job market suggesting travelers are elongating trips where their money travels further. This concept is not widely used in tourism research. It is related to the short-lived phenomenon that is more widely known as [[staycation]].

===Medical tourism===
{{Main|Medical tourism}}
When there is a significant price difference between countries for a given medical procedure, particularly in [[Southeast Asia]], [[India]], [[Eastern Europe]], [[Cuba]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/18/world/americas/americans-may-see-appeal-of-medical-tourism-in-cuba.html|title=Americans May See Appeal of Medical Tourism in Cuba|last=Neuman|first=William|date=17 February 2015|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Canada]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.deloitte.com/ca/en/pages/life-sciences-and-healthcare/articles/evolving-medical-tourism-in-canada.html|title=Evolving medical tourism in Canada {{!}} Deloitte Canada|website=Deloitte Canada|access-date=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; where there are different regulatory regimes, in relation to particular medical procedures (e.g. [[dentistry]]), traveling to take advantage of the price or regulatory differences is often referred to as "medical tourism".

===Educational tourism===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
Educational tourism is developed because of the growing popularity of teaching and learning of knowledge and the enhancing of technical competency outside of classroom environment. In educational tourism, the main focus of the tour or leisure activity includes visiting another country to learn about the culture, study tours, or to work and apply skills learned inside the classroom in a different environment, such as in the International Practicum Training Program.

=== Event tourism ===
This type of tourism is focused tourists coming into a region to either participate in an event  or to see an organized event put on by the city/region.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/760291882|title=Tourism management : an introduction|last=Clare.|first=Inkson,|date=2012|publisher=SAGE|others=Minnaert, Lynn.|isbn=9781848608696|location=Los Angeles|oclc=760291882}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This type of tourism can also fall under [[sustainable tourism]] as well and companies that create a [[Sustainable event management|sustainable event]] to attend open up a chance to not only the consumer but their workers to learn and develop from the experience. Creating a sustainable atmosphere it creates a chance to inform and encourage sustainable practices. An example of event tourism would be the music festival [[South by Southwest]] that is hosted in [[Austin, Texas]] annually. This is a perfect example because very year people from all over the world flock to this one city for one week to sit in on technology talks and see a whole city of bands perform. These people are being drawn here to experience something that they are not able to experience in their hometown which is exactly what event tourism is about.

===Creative tourism===
[[File:FF of Hartwell welcomes Indonesians.jpg|thumb|left|[[Friendship Force International|Friendship Force]] visitors from Indonesia meet their hosts in [[Hartwell, Georgia]], USA.]]
Creative tourism has existed as a form of [[cultural tourism]], since the early beginnings of tourism itself. Its European roots date back to the time of the [[Grand Tour]], which saw the sons of aristocratic families traveling for the purpose of mostly interactive, educational experiences. More recently, creative tourism has been given its own name by Crispin Raymond and Greg Richards,&lt;ref name="ct"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wurzburger|first=Rebecca|title=Creative Tourism: A Global Conversation: How to Provide Unique Creative Experiences for Travelers Worldwide: As Presented at the 2008 Santa Fe &amp; UNESCO International Conference on Creative Tourism in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA|publisher=Sunstone Press|location=Santa Fe|year=2009|isbn=978-0-86534-724-3|oclc=370387178|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; who as members of the Association for Tourism and Leisure Education (ATLAS), have directed a number of projects for the [[European Commission]], including cultural and crafts tourism, known as [[sustainable tourism]]. They have defined "creative tourism" as tourism related to the active participation of travellers in the [[culture]] of the host community, through interactive workshops and informal learning experiences.&lt;ref name="ct"/&gt;

Meanwhile, the concept of creative tourism has been picked up by high-profile organizations such as [[UNESCO]], who through the [[Creative Cities Network]], have endorsed creative tourism as an engaged, [[authenticity (reenactment)|authentic]] experience that promotes an active understanding of the specific cultural features of a [[Location (geography)|place]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

More recently, creative tourism has gained popularity as a form of cultural tourism, drawing on active participation by travelers in the culture of the host communities they visit. Several countries offer examples of this type of tourism development, including the United Kingdom, Austria, France, the Bahamas, Jamaica, Spain, Italy, New Zealand and South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.legco.gov.hk/research-publications/english/essentials-1617ise03-creative-tourism.htm|title=Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region - Creative tourism|last=Lau|first=Samantha|date=14 November 2016|website=Legislative Council of Hong Kong|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The growing interest of tourists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Charlie Mansfield Lecturer in Tourism Management and French |url=http://www.tourismconsumption.org/ |title=JTCaP Tourism Consumption Online Journal |publisher=Tourismconsumption.org |accessdate=10 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130415231711/http://www.tourismconsumption.org/ |archivedate=15 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; in this new way to discover a culture regards particularly the operators and branding managers, attentive to the possibility of attracting a quality tourism, highlighting the intangible heritage (craft workshops, cooking classes, etc.) and optimizing the use of existing infrastructure (for example, through the rent of halls and auditorium).

===Experiential tourism===
[[Experiential travel]] (or "immersion travel") is one of the major market trends in the modern tourism industry. It is an approach to travelling which focuses on experiencing a country, city or particular place by connecting to its [[history]], people, food and [[culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/08/nyregion/your-home-the-new-frontier-for-tourists-in-new-york-city.html|title=Your Home, the New Frontier for Tourists in New York City|first=Ginia|last=Bellafante|date=6 July 2012|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term “Experiential travel” is already mentioned in publications from 1985&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=o_QJAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22experiential+travel%22&amp;dq=%22experiential+travel%22|title=Insights in Strategic Retail Management|publisher=|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; – however it was discovered as a meaningful market trend much later.

===Dark tourism===
{{Main|Dark tourism}}
[[File:Poland - Czermna - Chapel of Skulls - interior 06.jpg|thumb|The [[Skull Chapel, Czermna|Skull Chapel]] in south-western [[Poland]] is an example of [[dark tourism]]. Its interior walls, ceiling and foundations are adorned by human remains. It is the only such monument in Poland, and one of six in [[Europe]].]]
One emerging area of special interest has been identified by Lennon and Foley (2000)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/turnsofphrase/tp-dar2.htm|title=Dark Tourism|last=Quinion|first=Michael|date=26 November 2005|work=World Wide Words|accessdate=9 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lennon|first1=J. John |first2=Malcolm|last2=Foley|location=London|title=Dark Tourism|publisher=Continuum|year=2000|isbn=978-0-8264-5063-0 |oclc=44603703}}&lt;/ref&gt; as [[Dark tourism|"dark" tourism]]. This type of tourism involves visits to "dark" sites, such as battlegrounds, scenes of horrific crimes or acts of [[genocide]], for example [[Internment|concentration camps]]. Its origins are rooted in fairgrounds and medieval fairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cooper|first=Chris|title=Tourism: Principles and Practice|publisher=[[Pearson Education]]|location=Harlow|year=2005|edition= 3rd|isbn=978-0-273-68406-0|oclc=466952897|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philip Stone]] argues that dark tourism is a way of imagining one's own death through the real death of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stone|first=Philip R.|date=1 July 2012|title=Dark tourism and significant other death: Towards a Model of Mortality Mediation|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160738312000564|journal=Annals of Tourism Research|volume=39|issue=3|pages=1565–87|doi=10.1016/j.annals.2012.04.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erik H Cohen]] introduces the term "[[populo sites]]" to evidence the educational character of dark tourism. Populo sites transmit the story of victimized people to visitors. Based on a study at [[Yad Vashem]], the Shoah (Holocaust) memorial museum in Jerusalem, a new term—''in populo''—is proposed to describe dark tourism sites at a spiritual and population center of the people to whom a tragedy befell. Learning about the Shoah in Jerusalem offers an encounter with the subject which is different from visits to sites in Europe, but equally authentic. It is argued that a dichotomy between "authentic" sites at the location of a tragedy and "created" sites elsewhere is insufficient. Participants' evaluations of seminars for European teachers at Yad Vashem indicate that the location is an important aspect of a meaningful encounter with the subject. Implications for other cases of dark tourism at ''in populo'' locations are discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Erik H.|date=1 January 2011|title=Educational dark tourism at an in populo site: The Holocaust Museum in Jerusalem|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160738310001040|journal=Annals of Tourism Research|volume=38|issue=1|pages=193–209|doi=10.1016/j.annals.2010.08.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this vein, [[Peter Tarlow]] defines dark tourism as the tendency to visit the scenes of tragedies or historically noteworthy deaths, which continue to impact our lives. This issue cannot be understood without the figure of trauma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ciW6GbT5jNEC|title=Niche Tourism|last=Novelli|first=Marina|date=1 June 2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1136376177|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social tourism===
Social tourism is making tourism available to poor people who otherwise could not afford to travel for their education or recreation. It includes [[youth hostels]] and low-priced holiday accommodation run by church and [[voluntary organisation]]s, [[trade unions]], or in Communist times [[combine (enterprise)|publicly owned enterprises]]. In May 1959, at the second Congress of Social Tourism in Austria, [[Walter Hunziker#Social tourism|Walter Hunziker]] proposed the following definition: "Social tourism is a type of tourism practiced by low income groups, and which is rendered possible and facilitated by entirely separate and therefore easily recognizable services".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/261135450|title=Tourism : principles, practices, philosophies|last=R.|first=Goeldner, Charles|date=2009|publisher=John Wiley|others=Ritchie, J. R. Brent.|isbn=9780470382134|edition= Eleventh|location=Hoboken, N.J.|oclc=261135450}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Doom tourism===
[[File:Perito Moreno Glacier Patagonia Argentina Luca Galuzzi 2005.JPG|thumb|[[Perito Moreno Glacier]], [[Patagonia]], [[Argentina]].]]

Also known as "Tourism of Doom," or "Last Chance Tourism" this emerging trend involves traveling to places that are environmentally or otherwise threatened (such as the ice caps of [[Mount Kilimanjaro]], the melting glaciers of [[Patagonia]], or the coral of the [[Great Barrier Reef]]) before it is too late. Identified by travel trade magazine [[Travel Age West]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shapiro |first=Kenneth |url=http://www.travelagewest.com/Travel-News/Viewpoint/The-Tourism-of-Doom/ |title=TravelAge West – TravelAge West |publisher=Travelagewest.com |date=11 May 2007 |accessdate=30 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; editor-in-chief Kenneth Shapiro in 2007 and later explored in ''[[The New York Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Salkin |first=Allen |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/16/world/americas/16iht-tourism.1.8762449.html |title='Tourism of doom' on rise|publisher=Nytimes.com |date=16 December 2007 |accessdate=30 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; this type of tourism is believed to be on the rise. Some see the trend as related to [[sustainable tourism]] or [[ecotourism]] due to the fact that a number of these tourist destinations are considered threatened by environmental factors such as global warming, overpopulation or climate change. Others worry that travel to many of these threatened locations increases an individual’s [[carbon footprint]] and only hastens problems threatened locations are already facing.&lt;ref&gt;Lemelin, H., Dawson, J., &amp; Stewart, E.

===Religious tourism===
{{Main|Religious tourism}}
[[File:Saint Peter's Basilica facade, Rome, Italy.jpg|thumb|[[St. Peter's Basilica]] in [[Vatican City]], the papal enclave within the Italian city of Rome, is one of the largest religious tourism sites in the world.]]
Religious tourism, in particular religious travel, is used to strengthen faith and show devotion both of which are central tenets of many major religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jafari|first=Jafar|last2=Scott|first2=Noel|date=1 January 2014|title=Muslim world and its tourisms|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160738313001199|journal=Annals of Tourism Research|volume=44|pages=1–19|doi=10.1016/j.annals.2013.08.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious tourists seek destinations whose image encourages them to believe that they can strengthen the religious elements of their self-identity in a positive manner. Given this, the perceived image of a destination may be positively influenced by whether it conforms to the requirements of their religious self-identity or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gannon|first=Martin Joseph|last2=Baxter|first2=Ian W.

==Growth==
The [[World Tourism Organization]] (UNWTO) forecasts that international tourism will continue growing at the average annual rate of 4%.&lt;ref name="predict"&gt;{{cite web| year = 2004| url = http://www.world-tourism.org/market_research/facts/market_trends.htm| title = Long-term Prospects: Tourism 2020 Vision| publisher = World Tourism| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20040619001112/http://www.world-tourism.org/market_research/facts/market_trends.htm| archivedate = 19 June 2004| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the advent of [[electronic commerce|e-commerce]], tourism products have become one of the most traded items on the internet. {{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Tourism products and services have been made available through intermediaries, although tourism providers (hotels, airlines, etc.), including small-scale operators, can sell their services directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lu|first=Jie|last2=Lu|first2=Zi|date=1 July 2004|title=Development, Distribution and Evaluation of Online Tourism Services in China|journal=Electronic Commerce Research|language=en|volume=4|issue=3|pages=221–39|doi=10.1023/B:ELEC.0000027981.81945.2a|issn=1389-5753}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karanasios|first=Stan|last2=Burgess|first2=Stephen|date=1 March 2008|title=Tourism and internet adoption: a developing world perspective|journal=International Journal of Tourism Research|language=en|volume=10|issue=2|pages=169–82|doi=10.1002/jtr.649|issn=1522-1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has put pressure on intermediaries from both on-line and traditional shops.

It has been suggested there is a strong correlation between tourism expenditure per capita and the degree to which countries play in the global context.&lt;ref name="correl"&gt;{{cite web | year = 2007| url = http://global-culture.org/blog/2007/01/27/airports-tourists/ | title =airports &amp; tourists | publisher = Global Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Not only as a result of the important economic contribution of the tourism industry, but also as an indicator of the degree of confidence with which global citizens leverage the resources of the globe for the benefit of their [[Community-based economics|local economies]]. This is why any projections of growth in tourism may serve as an indication of the relative influence that each country will exercise in the future.

===Space tourism===
{{Main|Space tourism}}

There has been a limited amount of orbital [[space tourism]], with only the [[Russian Space Agency]] providing transport to date. A 2010 report into space tourism anticipated that it could become a billion-dollar market by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Economic Impact of Commercial Space Transportation on the U.

===Sports tourism===
{{Main|Sports tourism}}

{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
Since the late 1980s, [[sports tourism]] has become increasingly popular. Events such as rugby, Olympics, Commonwealth games, Asian Games and football World Cups have enabled specialist travel companies to gain official ticket allocation and then sell them in packages that include flights, hotels and excursions.

===Latest trends===
As a result of the [[late-2000s recession]], international arrivals suffered a strong slowdown beginning in June 2008. Growth from 2007 to 2008 was only 3.7% during the first eight months of 2008. This slowdown on international tourism demand was also reflected in the air transport industry, with a negative growth in September 2008 and a 3.3% growth in passenger traffic through September. The hotel industry also reported a slowdown, with room occupancy declining. In 2009 worldwide tourism arrivals decreased by 3.8%.&lt;ref name="UNWTO"&gt;{{cite web|last=UNWTO|title=UNWTO Tourism Highlights|url=http://mkt.unwto.org/sites/all/files/docpdf/unwtohighlights11enhr_1.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=UNWTO|accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the first quarter of 2009, real travel demand in the United States had fallen 6% over six quarters. While this is considerably milder than what occurred after the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attacks]], the decline was at twice the rate as real GDP has fallen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://journalistsresource.org/studies/economics/commerce/tourism-impacts-world-economic-crisis-north-america/ | title=Impacts of the World Recession and Economic Crisis on Tourism: North America}} JournalistsResource.org.

However, evidence suggests that tourism as a global phenomenon shows no signs of substantially abating in the long term. It has been suggested that travel is necessary in order to maintain relationships, as social life is increasingly networked and conducted at a distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Urry|first=John|title=Social Networks, Travel and Talk|journal=British Journal of Sociology|year=2003|volume=54|issue=2|pages=155–75|doi=10.1080/0007131032000080186|pmid=12945865}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many people vacations and travel are increasingly being viewed as a necessity rather than a luxury, and this is reflected in tourist numbers recovering some 6.6% globally over 2009, with growth up to 8% in emerging economies.&lt;ref name="UNWTO"/&gt;

World-Information Institute (WII) is an independent cultural institution located in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]] linking research and public discourse in the realms of innovation, digital culture technologies, and society. Its vast documentation and processing of digital media technologies sheds light on the future perspectives of global developments and involves complex and heterogeneous information resources.

World-Information Institute forms part of an international network of partner institutions and experts in the fields of information and communication technologies and their social implications.

WII’s main fields of research are a politics of the commons (and, from this perspective: problems of intellectual property regimes), new forms of cultural production, politics of search and organization of knowledge, surveillance technologies, big data and visualization, cultural and media policies. A recent example of an activity to further develop cultural and media policies is “Netzpolitischer Konvent” (Convention of the Austrian civil society on net politics),&lt;ref&gt;https://npk.servus.at/ (in German), retrieved: 16-09-2013&lt;/ref&gt; in which a catalogue of demands was drafted and subsequently presented to the public.

World-Information.Org was launched as the main media project of the [[European Capital of Culture]] 2000 in Brussels. The social, cultural and political dimensions of the new information and communication technologies were discussed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerin.at/dyn/heft.php?id=10&amp;pos=3&amp;textid=110&amp;lang=de Springerin – Hefte für Gegenwartskunst, Heft 3/00] (in German, retrieved: 03-16-2017)&lt;/ref&gt; The World-Information exhibition presented objects and research results on topics such as the history of modern communication technologies, the "big players" in the IT industry, financial networks or human rights. The program was completed by the "World-InfoCon" conference. Most resources are available on the world-information.org page.&lt;ref&gt;[http://world-information.org/wio/program/brussels2000/events/1032966488/993056460/objects/993056638/993056659 World Infostructure Exhibition] (retrieved: 03-16-2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Deep Search" conference critically dealt with "the social and political dimensions of how we navigate the deep seas of knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;http://world-information.org/wii/deep_search/en/book/deepsearch-book_en/ (retrieved: 21-09-2016)&lt;/ref&gt; Critically analyzing a situation in which [[Google_Search|Google]] assumes a monopoly-like position in the field of search in many countries around the world, the conference asked questions as: „How is computer readable significance produced, how is meaning involved in machine communication? Where is the emancipatory potential of having access to such vast amounts of information? What are the dangers of our reliance on search engines? And are there any approaches that do not follow the currently dominating paradigm of [[Google_Search|Google]]?“ &lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Critical Strategies in Art and Media - New York 2009 ===

This conference on the future of cultural freedom and cultural intelligence in digital theory and practice &lt;ref&gt;http://world-information.org/wii/critical_strategies/en (retrieved: 21-09-2016)&lt;/ref&gt; took place at the [[Austrian Cultural Forum New York]]. It followed attempts to go beyound the obsolete models of the artist/author as genius and searched for collective and collaborative practices that could invent new terrains and flows. New kinds of 'virtual' spaces and their role for critical cultural practices were discussed. The conference also aimed at developing strategies that could elude being instrumentalized by the creative industries in their „seemingly infinite appetite for things radical“. &lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Deep Search (II) - Vienna 2010 ===

The debate on the policies of searching continued 2010 with the conference "Deep Search II": "The automatic classification of data, its indexing, and its evaluation are at the heart of new communication environments. What lies beneath is not just a drive to organize the world's information, but also to classify human relations: from the management of the modern workplace and consumers in mass societies, to the bio-political management of the network society."&lt;ref&gt;http://world-information.org/wii/deep_search2/en/ (retrieved: 21-09-2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shared Digital Futures - Vienna 2013 ===

The conference "Shared Digital Futures" &lt;ref&gt;http://world-information.net/sdf/ (retrieved: 21-09-2016)&lt;/ref&gt; dealt with the impact of digital networking technologies to the production of culture and examined about the new role of the artwork as the same end product and raw material for further production of culture, models for sustainable funding of Commons, new forms of collective authorship and the opportunities opened by the blurring of boundaries between artists and audiences.

=== Information as a reality - Linz, 2014 ===

The conference and exhibition "Information as a reality" &lt;ref&gt;http://world-information.net/iar/ (retrieved: 21-09-2016)&lt;/ref&gt; in cooperation with the magazine [[:de:Springerin|Springerin]] and with [[Ars Electronica]] at the [[Lentos Art Museum]] in Linz dealt with critical cultural practices in digital networks and the increasing change of social reality by digital models and virtual information regimes. Cultural workers have played an important pioneering role in the colonization of digital worlds. What role can they assume now, 20 years after the emergence of the Internet?

=== Digital Clouds and Urban Spaces - Vienna 2014 ===

The conference "Digital Clouds and Urban Spaces" &lt;ref&gt;http://world-information.net/digital-clouds/ (retrieved: 08-10-2016)&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Architekturzentrum Wien]] focused on [[Smart Cities]] and the city as an information system where urbanity is increasingly shaped by networks of informational technologies. The conference took account to the fact, that this does not only apply to phenomena as traffic control systems or planning models, but that the world of work, social spaces and cultural processes are also subject to substantial transformations related to these developments. Before this backdrop, the conference questioned the simplistic promises made by global corporations and their technologies to render cities more efficient, safer and cleaner.

=== Critical Net Practice – Vienna 2015 ===

In a cooperation with the magazine [[:de:Springerin|Springerin]] World-Information Institute revisited 20 years of net culture. The resulting texts formed the main part of issue XXI/1 (winter 2015) of the magazine.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.springerin.at/dyn/heft.php?id=87&amp;pos=0&amp;textid=0&amp;lang=en (retrieved: 21-09-2016).

=== Algorithmic Regimes - Vienna 2015/2016 ===

The international conference and event series "Algorithmic Regimes" &lt;ref&gt;A brief description of all project parts with links to documentation videos can be found at http://world-information.net/algorithmic-regimes-and-generative-strategies/ (retrieved: 21-09-2016).&lt;/ref&gt; examined the growing influence of digital control systems and their cascading effects of powerful effect on cultural and social realities. In addition to the conference, the event „Algorithms are no Angels“ with [[Matthew Fuller (author)|Matthew Fuller]] und Graham Harwood, a Videointerview with Stefano Harney, and an audiovisual evening about the power of algorithms were conducted, that presented an annotated remix of film clips and documentaries,&lt;ref&gt;The playlist can be found at http://world-information.net/screening-the-algorithmic/ (retrieved: 21-09-2016).&lt;/ref&gt; relating to automated control systems.

=== Wahlkabine.at ===
Wahlkabine.at was founded in 2002 by the Institute for New Culture Technologies/t0 and was presented for the first time during the National Council elections in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;"WWWahlspielchen", Falter 45/02 (November 2002), p. 21. The article is not available in the newspaper's online archive, which goes back only to the year 2005, download scan: http://wahlkabine.at/presse/falter2002/filedownload (in German).&lt;/ref&gt; The online polling-booth sees itself as an instrument of political education, which encourages the users to deal with political content in a playful way and provides factual information and feedback opportunities.

Given the fact that increasing personalization nowadays replaces more and more the political content, Wahlkabine.at considers the publication of all party-programs and their scientific contextualization as a fundamental tool for political participation as well as a revealing resource collection for personal reflection on the voting behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. "Why wahlkabine.at?" at: http://wahlkabine.at/ueber/Infofolder_wahlkabine_ENGL.pdf/attachment_download/file (retrieved 08-10-2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

Wahlkabine.at focuses on elections on Austrian national and regional levels and on EU-level (European Parliament), but also includes elections of the Austrian National Student Union and a few individual cases (e.g. Austrian Economic Chambers / Sector Information and Consulting 2010).&lt;ref&gt;For a list of all elections covered, cf. http://wahlkabine.at/archiv (in German), retrieved: 16-09-2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of regional elections in Vienna in autumn 2015 (with an electorate of approximately 1.14 million eligible voters) 160,000 users visited the online polling booth.&lt;ref&gt;http://wahlkabine.at/ltw2015wien/schlussauswertungltw2015wien/ (in German, retrieved: 21-09-2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Future Non Stop ===
Future Non Stop – started as a project in 2010, online since 2012 – is an extensive archive and an experiment in logics of navigating information: “Based on an extensive archive going back to 1994 the site collects materials that serve as important reference documents in the field of new media, politics, and art and makes them accessible to a wider public. Instead of a hierarchically structured archive an experimental navigation interface opens up new ways to explore large information nodes. Documents are associated by a range of tag that allow to filter relevance according to topics and issue relations. ASCR, short for Advanced Semantic Content Repository, is the open source information architecture and "editing back end" of Future Non Stop.” &lt;ref&gt;http://future-nonstop.org/ (retrieved: 22-09-2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institute for New Culture Technologies/t0===
[[File:Wio-savethedigitale-cology.jpg|thumb|left|Save the Digital Ecology/ Vienna 2000]]
The '''Institute for New Culture Technologies/t0''' was established in 1993 as an arts and culture related international competence platform for the critical use of information and communication technologies. Over the years it has pursued a broad range of transdisciplinary activities. From producing and hosting infrastructure to organizing conferences, festivals and exhibitions, local interventions and skill transfer, as well as international research and publishing. [[Konrad Becker]] and Francisco de Sousa Webber, who founded the institute, currently form the board of directors together with [[:de:Felix Stalder|Felix Stalder]].

When the founders of the Institute for New Culture Technologies/t0 set up a web server (in an unofficially tolerated act of ‘misuse’ of the underemployed Internet server of Vienna’s general hospital AKH) in 1993,&lt;ref&gt;Francisco de Sousa Webber: "Building a Netbase from Scratch", in: Branka Ćurčić / Zoran Pantelić / New Media Center_kuda.org (Eds.): ‘’Public Netbase: Non Stop Future - New Practices in Art and Media’’, Frankfurt a. M. (Revolver), 2008, online: http://nonstop-future.org/txt?tid=195606bfd5f57eb46cbc3100ef62ff0c, retrieved: 18-07-2013&lt;/ref&gt; they created one of the first arts and culture-related sites on the emerging World Wide Web.

The institute has been conceptualised as a platform from which independent initiatives and organizations could emerge. The first of these initiatives was [[Public Netbase]] – now an ‘historical example’ of an early new media organization in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Clemens Apprich / Felix Stalder (Hrsg.): ''Vergessene Zukunft. Radikale Netzkulturen in Europa.'' transcript, Bielefeld 2012, {{ISBN|978-3-8376-1906-5}} (in German).&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1994, it was located in Messepalast, the predecessor of Vienna’s [[Museumsquartier]]. It combined various functions and activities: It was a non-profit Internet service provider that facilitated internet access mainly for the independent arts and cultural sector. This was accompanied by a program of workshops and courses to develop media competence. Public Netbase became a social space for this emerging scene of artists, techheads, activists etc., and ran an almost daily evening program of discussions, presentations, screenings and music events. In addition to these grassroots activities international exhibitions and conferences were conducted.&lt;ref&gt;For the period 1995-1999 press coverage - mainly in Austria, but also in international newspapers and magazines, e.g. [[Frankfurter Rundschau]], Kunstforum International, [[The Daily Telegraph]], [[Mute (magazine)|Mute]], [[Süddeutsche Zeitung]], [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]], [[Telepolis]], [[The New York Times]] and Artbyte.The Magazine of Digital Arts - has been documented by t0: http://www.t0.or.at/1995.htm, http://www.t0.or.at/1996.htm, http://www.t0.or.at/1997.htm, http://www.t0.or.at/1998.htm, http://www.t0.or.at/1999.htm, retrieved: 04-12-2013, mostly in German&lt;/ref&gt; Public Netbase used to be t0’s main initiative until it had to be discontinued due to lack of funding (which was a result of repression by the Austrian right-wing government &lt;ref&gt;Subsidies by the federal government had made up a main part of Public Netbase’s funds before, cf. Robert Harauer / MEDIACULT (ed.): ''Digital Culture in Europe. A selective inventory of centres of innovation in the arts and new technologies'', Strasbourg (Council of Europe), 1999, pp. 14-17 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=FHkk5HfkcD4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Cyberculture+en+Europe&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Waw2UqHAA-Hh4QSW7oCgAQ&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Cyberculture%20en%20Europe&amp;f=false in Google books]))&lt;/ref&gt; in 2006.

But already in 1999 the next initiative had been founded: World-Information.Org (WIO). It was presented – under the patronage of [[UNESCO]] &lt;ref&gt;Cf. "The Exhibition 'World-Information.Org', Public Netbase t0", new media center_kuda.org, 28.07.2013, online: http://www.kuda.org/en/exhibition-world-informationorg-public-netbase-t0, retrieved: 16-09-2013, and F.E.Rakuschan, “Weltinformationsordnung 2.0”, [[Telepolis]] 28.11.2000 (in German), http://www.heise.de/tp/artikel/4/4350/1.html, retrieved 16-09-2013)&lt;/ref&gt; – as the lead project of the New-Media-program of the Brussels 2000 [[European Capital of Culture]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tacticalmediafiles.net/events/4724/World_Information-Brussels (retrieved: 08-10-2016)&lt;/ref&gt; WIO resembles an intelligence agency, that collects and analyses information, but not in the interest of a state or as a think tank for corporate businesses, but for the independent cultural sector. Starting from the Brussels project, a series of international exhibitions and conferences has been developed.
World-Information Institute (WII) is WIO’s research department. In addition to conducting research, it continues the program of international conferences and the activities to further develop culture and media policies. In addition, on the Austrian national level, wahlkabine.at was founded in 2002 and became Austria’s most prominent online “polling booth”.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. coverage by Austrian media documented at http://wahlkabine.at/presse, retrieved: 16-09-2013, Cf. e.g. „Wenig Übereinstimmung zwischen SPÖ und ÖVP“ ([[Der Standard|derStandard.at]], 19.08.2013, http://derstandard.at/1376533958426/wahlkabineat-Wenig-Uebereinstimmung-zwischen-SPOe-und-OeVP, retrieved: 04-12-2013, in German), „Wahlkabine.at bietet Entscheidungshilfe“ (ORF Zeit im Bild 1, 17.08.2013; ZiB1 is the main evening TV-newscast of the Austrian public broadcasting corporation [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]].

=== Public Netbase ===
[[Image:Netbase 3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Netbase, media~space]]
[[Public Netbase]] was initiated by the Institute for New Culture Technologies/t0 in the Vienna [[Museumsquartier]] in 1994 as a non-profit internet provider and a platform for the participatory use of information and communication technology. With its WWW-server as well as with its workshops, instruction courses, and educational events for the broad public, Public Netbase contributed continually to the evolution of a lively internet scene and a heightened consciousness for the implications of the new communication and information technologies.

As a focal point of European and international art, culture, and media networks, the Viennese net culture institute attempted to develop an understanding for the manifold opportunities and the potential of new communication media, but also to look critically at a society that is increasingly determined by technology.

In addition to the series of workshops and discussions the activities of Public Netbase included, among other, projects that combined exhibitions, conferences and workshops (e.g. Synworld playwork:hyperspace&lt;ref&gt;http://synworld.t0.or.at/, retrieved: 16-09-2013&lt;/ref&gt; (1999) and Free Bitflows &lt;ref&gt;http://freebitflows.t0.or.at/, retrieved: 16-09-2013, http://v2.nl/events/free-bitflows/, retrieved: 16-09-2013&lt;/ref&gt; (2004)), projects in public space (nikeground&lt;ref&gt;http://www.t0.or.at/nikeground, retrieved: 16-09-2013; cf.

Public Netbase was very active in the resistance movements against the Austrian right-wing government, that came into power beginning of 2000 and included Jörg Haider’s Freedom Party (FPÖ). An own strand of activities derived from this (e.g. government-austria.at &lt;ref&gt;http://government-austria.at/, retrieved: 11-07-2013&lt;/ref&gt; (2000/2001)) and elements of political activism became stronger across all strands of activities.

{{Zombies}}

A '''zombie''' ([[Haitian French]]: ''{{lang|fr|zombi}}'', {{lang-ht|zonbi}}) is a fictional [[undead]] being created through the reanimation of a human [[corpse]]. Zombies are most commonly found in [[Horror fiction|horror]] and [[fantasy]] genre works. The term comes from [[Culture of Haiti#Folklore and mythology|Haitian folklore]], where a ''zombie'' is a dead body reanimated through various methods, most commonly [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]. Modern depictions of the reanimation of the dead do not necessarily involve magic but often invoke [[science fiction]]al methods such as [[Asymptomatic carrier|carrier]]s, [[radiation]], mental diseases, [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]]s, [[pathogens]], scientific accidents, etc.&lt;ref name="PM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/column/159439-legacy-of-the-living-dead/|author=Maçek III, J.C.|work=[[PopMatters]]|title=The Zombification Family Tree: Legacy of the Living Dead|date=15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Better Off Dead: The Evolution of the Zombie as Post-Human|editor= Deborah Christie, Sarah Juliet Lauro|page=169|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0oZIlm84F2oC&amp;pg=PA57|isbn=978-0-8232-3447-9 |publisher=Fordham Univ Press|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[English language|English]] word "zombie" is first recorded in 1819, in a history of [[Brazil]] by the poet [[Robert Southey]], in the form of "zombi".&lt;ref name="Zombie"&gt;[http://0-www.oed.com.catalogue.ulrls.lon.ac.uk/view/Entry/232982?redirectedFrom=zombie#eid "Zombie"]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, in [[Oxford English Dictionary]] Online {{subscription}}, accessed 23 May 2014. The quotation cited is: "Zombi, the title whereby he [chief of Brazilian natives] was called, is the name for the Deity, in the Angolan tongue."&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] gives the origin of the word as West African, and compares it to the [[Kongo language|Kongo]] words ''{{lang|kg|nzambi}}'' (god) and ''{{lang|kg|zumbi}}'' ([[fetishism|fetish]]).  A [[Kimbundu]]-to -Portuguese dictionary from 1903 defines the related word &lt;i&gt;nzumbi&lt;/i&gt; as soul,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Pereira Do Nascimento|first= Jose|date= 1903|title= Diccionario Portuguez-Kimbundu|url= https://archive.org/details/diccionarioport00nascgoog|publisher= Huilla : Typographia da Missão|}}&lt;/ref&gt; while a later Kimbundu{{endash}}Portuguese dictionary defines it as being a "spirit that is supposed to wander the earth to torment the living."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= de Assis Junior|first= A.|date= unknown|title= Diccionario Portuguez-Kimbundu|url= https://archive.org/stream/dicionriokimbu00assiuoft#page/378/search/nzumbi|publisher= Luanda Argente, Santos|}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

One of the first books to expose Western culture to the concept of the voodoo zombie was ''The Magic Island'' by [[William Seabrook|W. B. Seabrook]] in 1929. This is the sensationalized account of a narrator who encounters [[Voodoo doll|voodoo]] cults in [[Haiti]] and their resurrected thralls. [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] claimed that the book "introduced 'zombi' into U.S. speech".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,764649,00.html |title=Books: Mumble-Jumble |publisher=TIME |date=1940-09-09 |accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zombies have a complex literary heritage, with antecedents ranging from [[Richard Matheson]] and [[H. P. Lovecraft]] to [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'' drawing on European folklore of the [[undead]]. In 1932, [[Victor Halperin]] directed ''[[White Zombie (film)|White Zombie]]'', a horror film starring [[Bela Lugosi]]. Here zombies are depicted as mindless, unthinking henchmen under the spell of an evil magician. Zombies, often still using this voodoo-inspired rationale, were initially uncommon in cinema, but their appearances continued sporadically through the 1930s to the 1960s, with notable films including ''[[I Walked with a Zombie]]'' (1943) and ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]'' (1959).

A new version of the zombie, distinct from that described in Haitian folklore, has also emerged in popular culture during the latter half of the twentieth century. This "zombie" is taken largely from [[George A. Romero]]'s seminal film ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'',&lt;ref name="PM"/&gt; which was in turn partly inspired by [[Richard Matheson]]'s 1954 novel ''[[I Am Legend (novel)|I Am Legend]]''.&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"&gt;Deborah Christie, Sarah Juliet Lauro, ed.

The "[[zombie apocalypse]]" concept, in which the civilized world is brought low by a global zombie infestation, became a staple of modern popular art.

==Etymology==
The [[English language|English]] word "zombie" is first recorded in 1819, in a history of [[Brazil]] by the poet [[Robert Southey]], in the form of "zombi", actually referring to the Afro-Brazilian rebel leader named [[Zumbi]] and the etymology of his name in "nzambi".&lt;ref name="Zombie"/&gt; The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] gives the origin of the word as West African and compares it to the [[Kongo language|Kongo]] words "nzambi" (god) and "zumbi" (fetish).

In [[Culture of Haiti|Haitian folklore]], a ''zombie'' ([[Haitian French]]: ''zombi'', [[Haitian Creole]]: ''zonbi'') is an [[Undead|animated corpse]] raised by magical means, such as [[witchcraft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | title = Zombie | encyclopedia = Oxford English Dictionary | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept has been popularly associated with the [[Haitian Vodou|religion of voodoo]], but it plays no part in that faith's formal practices.

How the creatures in contemporary zombie films came to be called "zombies" is not fully clear. The film ''Night of the Living Dead'' made no spoken reference to its undead antagonists as "zombies", describing them instead as "[[ghoul]]s" (though ghouls, which derive from Arabic folklore, are demons, not undead). Although George Romero used the term "ghoul" in his original scripts, in later interviews he used the term "zombie". The word "zombie" is used exclusively by Romero in his 1978 script for his sequel ''[[Dawn of the Dead (1978 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]'',&lt;ref&gt;George A. Romero ''Dawn of the Dead'' (Working draft 1977) [http://www.horrorlair.com/scripts/dawnofthedead.txt Horrorlair.com]&lt;/ref&gt; including once in dialog. According to George Romero, film critics were influential in associating the term "zombie" to his creatures, and especially the French magazine "[[Cahiers du Cinéma]]". He eventually accepted this linkage, even though he remained convinced at the time that "zombies" corresponded to the undead slaves of Haitian voodoo as depicted in [[Bela Lugosi]]'s ''[[White Zombie (film)|White Zombie]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=J'irai loler sur vos tombes - Romero|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0CFFRkLqrg|location=11min 15sec|date=2011-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Folk beliefs==

===Haitian tradition===
[[File:Zombie haiti ill artlibre jnl.png|thumb|right|A depiction of a zombie, at twilight, in a field of sugar cane.]]
Zombies are featured widely in Haitian rural folklore as dead persons physically revived by the act of [[necromancy]] of a ''[[bokor]]'', a sorcerer or witch. The ''bokor'' is opposed by the ''[[houngan]]'' or priest and the ''[[Mambo (Vodou)|mambo]]'' or priestess of the formal [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo religion]]. A zombie remains under the control of the ''bokor'' as a personal slave, having no will of its own.

The Haitian tradition also includes an incorporeal type of zombie, the "zombie [[Astral body|astral]]", which is a part of the human [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]. A ''bokor'' can capture a zombie astral to enhance his spiritual power. A zombie astral can also be sealed inside a specially decorated bottle by a ''bokor'' and sold to a client to bring luck, healing, or business success. It is believed that God eventually will reclaim the zombie's soul, so the zombie is a temporary spiritual entity.&lt;ref name = Bottle&gt;*McAlister, Elizabeth. 1995."[http://wesscholar.wesleyan.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1016&amp;context=div2facpubs A Sorcerer's Bottle: The Visual Art of Magic in Haiti." In Donald J. Cosentino, ed., Sacred Arts of Haitian Vodou. UCLA Fowler Museum of Cultural History, 1995: 304–321.]"&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested{{who|date=October 2015}} that the two types of zombie reflect [[soul dualism]], a [[Haitian Vodou#Soul|belief of Haitian voodoo]]. Each type of legendary zombie is therefore missing one half of its soul (the flesh or the spirit).&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Wade (1985), ''The Serpent and the Rainbow'', New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, pp 186&lt;/ref&gt;

The zombie belief has its roots in traditions brought to Haiti by enslaved Africans, and their subsequent experiences in the New World. It was thought that the voodoo deity [[Baron Samedi]] would gather them from their grave to bring them to a heavenly afterlife in Africa ("[[Guinea (region)|Guinea]]"), unless they had offended him in some way, in which case they would be forever a slave after death, as a zombie. A zombie could also be saved by [[Salt#In religion|feeding them salt]]. English professor [[Amy Wilentz]] has written that the modern concept of Zombies was strongly influenced by [[slavery in Haiti|Haitian slavery]]. Slave drivers on the plantations, who were usually slaves themselves and sometimes Voodoo priests, used the fear of zombification to discourage slaves from committing suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilentz |first=Amy |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/31/opinion/a-zombie-is-a-slave-forever.html |title=A Zombie Is a Slave Forever |location=Haiti |work=The New York Times |date=2012-10-26 |accessdate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilentz |first=Amy |url=https://amywilentz.com/from-the-newsstands/response-to-i-walked-with-a-zombie/ |title=Response to “I Walked with a Zombie” |work=amywilentz.com |date=December 2011 |accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While most scholars have associated the Haitian zombie with African cultures, a connection has also been suggested to the island's indigenous [[Taíno people]], partly based on an early account of native [[Shamanism|shamanist]] practices written by the Hieronymite monk [[Ramón Pané]], a companion of [[Christopher Columbus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.smu.edu/bakewell/BAKEWELL/texts/panerelacion.html|title=The Relacion of Fray Ramon Pane|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Whitehead|first=Neal L.|title=Of Cannibals and Kings: Primal Anthropology in the Americas|date=2011|publisher=Penn State Press|pages=39–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edmonds|first1=Ennis B.|last2=Gonzalez|first2=Michelle A.|title=Caribbean Religious History: An Introduction|date=2010|publisher=NYU Press|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Haitian zombie phenomenon first attracted widespread international attention during the [[United States occupation of Haiti]] (1915–1934), when a number of [[medical history|case histories]] of purported "zombies" began to emerge. The first popular book covering the topics was [[William Seabrook]]'s ''The Magic Island'' (1929). Seabrooke cited Article 246 of the Haitian [[criminal code]] which was passed in 1864, asserting that it was an official recognition of zombies. This passage was later used in promotional materials for the 1932 film ''[[White Zombie (film)|White Zombie]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Seabrook|first1=William|title=The Magic Island|date=1929|publisher=Blue Ribbon Books|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Also shall be qualified as attempted murder the employment which may be made by any person of substances which, without causing actual death, produce a lethargic coma more or less prolonged.  If, after the administering of such substances, the person has been buried, the act shall be considered murder no matter what result follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oas.org/juridico/mla/fr/hti/fr_hti_penal.html|title=Code pénal|website=www.oas.org|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1937, while researching [[folklore]] in Haiti, [[Zora Neale Hurston]] encountered the case of a woman who appeared in a village. A family claimed she was Felicia Felix-Mentor, a relative who had died and been buried in 1907 at the age of 29. The woman was examined by a doctor; X-rays indicated that she did not have a leg fracture that Felix-Mentor was known to have had.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Mars | first1 = Louis P. | title = Media life zombies for the world| doi = 10.2307/2792947 | jstor = 2792947 | journal = [[Man (journal)|Man]]| volume = 45 | number = 22| pages = 38–40 | year = 1945 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hurston pursued rumors that affected persons were given a powerful [[psychoactive drug]], but she was unable to locate individuals willing to offer much information. She wrote, "What is more, if science ever gets to the bottom of Vodou in Haiti and Africa, it will be found that some important medical secrets, still unknown to medical science, give it its power, rather than gestures of ceremony."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hurston|first=Zora Neale|title=Dust Tracks on a Road|publisher=2nd Ed. (1942: Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1984, p. 205)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===African and related legends===
A Central or West African origin for the Haitian zombie has been postulated based on two etymologies in the [[Kongo language]], ''nzambi'' ("god") and ''zumbi'' ("[[fetishism|fetish]]"). This root helps form the names of several deities, including the Kongo creator deity [[Nzambi a Mpungu]] and the Louisiana serpent deity [[Li Grand Zombi]] (a local version of the Haitian [[Damballa]]), but it is in fact a generic word for a divine spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moreman|first1=Christopher M.|last2=Rushton|first2=Cory James|title=Race, Oppression and the Zombie: Essays on Cross-Cultural Appropriations of the Caribbean Tradi|date=2011|publisher=McFarland|page=3 | isbn= 978-0-7864-5911-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The common African conception of beings under these names is more similar to the incorporeal "zombie astral",&lt;ref name = Bottle/&gt; as in the Kongo [[Nkisi]] spirits.

A related, but also often incorporeal, undead being is the [[jumbee]] of the [[Commonwealth Caribbean|English-speaking Caribbean]], considered to be of the same etymology;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Brian L.|title=Cultural Power, Resistance, and Pluralism: Colonial Guyana, 1838-1900|date=1995|publisher=University of California Press|pages=147–149}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[French West Indies]] also, local "zombies" are recognized, but these are of a more general spirit nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dayan|first=Joan|title=Haiti, History, and the Gods|date=1998|publisher=University of California Press|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of physical zombie-like creatures is present in some South African cultures, where they are called ''xidachane'' in [[Sotho language|Sotho]]/[[Tsonga language|Tsonga]] and ''maduxwane'' in [[Venda language|Venda]]. In some communities, it is believed that a dead person can be zombified by a small child.&lt;ref name="Marinovich84"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Bang-Bang Club Snapshots from a Hidden War |last1=Marinovich |first1=Greg |authorlink=Greg Marinovich |author2=Silva Joao |year=2000 |publisher=William Heinemann|isbn=0-434-00733-1 |page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that the spell can be broken by a powerful enough [[sangoma]].&lt;ref name="Marinovich98"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Bang-Bang Club Snapshots from a Hidden War |last1=Marinovich |first1=Greg |authorlink=Greg Marinovich |author2=Silva Joao |year=2000 |publisher=William Heinemann|isbn=0-434-00733-1 |page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also believed in some areas of South Africa that [[witch]]es can zombify a person by killing and possessing the victim's body in order to force it into slave labor.&lt;ref name=Niehaus&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Niehaus |first= Isak |title=Witches and Zombies of the South African Lowveld: Discourse, Accusations and Subjective Reality |journal= The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute |date=June 2005|volume= 11| pages =197–198 |issue= 2 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9655.2005.00232.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; After rail lines were built to transport migrant workers, stories emerged about "witch trains". These trains appeared ordinary, but were staffed by zombified workers controlled by a witch. The trains would abduct a person boarding at night, and the person would then either be turned into a zombified worker, or beaten and thrown from the train a distance away from the original location.&lt;ref name=Niehaus/&gt;

===Origins of zombie beliefs===
====Chemical hypothesis====
Several decades after Hurston's work,  [[Wade Davis (anthropologist)|Wade Davis]], a Harvard [[ethnobotanist]], presented a pharmacological case for zombies in a 1983 paper in the ''[[Journal of Ethnopharmacology]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |pmid = 6668953|year = 1983|last1 = Davis|first1 = E. W.|title = The ethnobiology of the Haitian zombi|journal = Journal of Ethnopharmacology|volume = 9|issue = 1|pages = 85–104}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later in two popular books, ''[[The Serpent and the Rainbow (book)|The Serpent and the Rainbow]]'' (1985) and ''Passage of Darkness: The Ethnobiology of the Haitian Zombie ''(1988).

Davis traveled to Haiti in 1982 and, as a result of his investigations, claimed that a living person can be turned into a zombie by two special powders being introduced into the blood stream (usually via a wound). The first, ''coup de poudre'' (French: "powder strike"), includes [[tetrodotoxin]] (TTX), a powerful and frequently fatal neurotoxin found in the flesh of the [[Tetraodontidae|pufferfish]] (order Tetraodontidae). The second powder consists of [[Deliriant|deliriant drugs]] such as [[datura]]. Together, these powders were said to induce a deathlike state in which the will of the victim would be entirely subjected to that of the bokor. Davis also popularized the story of [[Clairvius Narcisse]], who was claimed to have succumbed to this practice. The most ethically questioned and least scientifically explored ingredient of the powders, is part of a recently buried child's brain.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Wade (1985), ''The Serpent and the Rainbow'', New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, pp 92-95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Wade (1988), ''Passage of Darkness: The Ethnobiology of the Haitian Zombie'', [[University of North Carolina Press]], pp 115-116.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/zombies_and_tetrodotoxin/|author=Terence Hines|title=Zombies and Tetrodotoxin; Follow-up|publisher=Skeptical Inquirer (csicop.org)|volume=32.3|date=2008|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify-inline|date=September 2013}}

The process described by Davis was an initial state of deathlike [[suspended animation]], followed by re-awakening&amp;nbsp;— typically ''after'' being buried&amp;nbsp;— into a psychotic state. The psychosis induced by the drug and [[psychological trauma]] was [[hypothesis]]ed by Davis to reinforce culturally learned beliefs and to cause the individual to reconstruct their identity as that of a zombie, since they "knew" they were dead, and had no other role to play in the Haitian society. Societal reinforcement of the belief was hypothesized by Davis to confirm for the zombie individual the zombie state, and such individuals were known to hang around in graveyards, exhibiting attitudes of low affect.

Davis's claim has been criticized, particularly the suggestion that Haitian witch doctors can keep "zombies" in a state of pharmacologically induced trance for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Booth | first1 = W | year = 1988 | title = Voodoo Science | url = | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 240 | issue = 4850| pages = 274–277 | doi=10.1126/science.3353722}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms of [[Tetrodotoxin poisoning|TTX poisoning]] range from numbness and nausea to paralysis&amp;nbsp;— particularly of the muscles of the diaphragm&amp;nbsp;— unconsciousness, and death, but do not include a stiffened gait or a deathlike trance. According to psychologist [[Terence Hines]], the scientific community dismisses tetrodotoxin as the cause of this state, and Davis' assessment of the nature of the reports of Haitian zombies is viewed as overly credulous.&lt;ref name="Hines, Terence Pages 60–62"&gt;Hines, Terence; "Zombies and Tetrodotoxin"; ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]''; May/June 2008; Volume 32, Issue 3; Pages 60–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social hypothesis====
Scottish psychiatrist [[R. D. Laing]] highlighted the link between social and cultural expectations and compulsion, in the context of [[schizophrenia]] and other mental illness, suggesting that schizogenesis may account for some of the psychological aspects of zombification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Oswald|first=Hans Peter|title=Vodoo|publisher=BoD – Books on Demand|date=2009|page=39|isbn=3-8370-5904-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Particularly, this suggests cases where schizophrenia manifests a state of [[catatonia]].

[[Roland Littlewood]], professor of anthropology and psychiatry, published a study supporting a social explanation of the zombie phenomenon in the medical journal ''[[The Lancet]]'' in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Littlewood |first1=Roland |author2=Chavannes Douyon|title=Clinical findings in three cases of zombification|journal=[[The Lancet]]|date=11 October 1997|volume=350|issue=9084|pages=1094–1096|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(97)04449-8/fulltext|accessdate=28 March 2014 |doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(97)04449-8 |pmid=10213568}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I came to the conclusion that although it is unlikely that there is a single explanation for all cases where zombies are recognised by locals in Haiti, the mistaken identification of a wandering mentally ill stranger by bereaved relatives is the most likely explanation in many cases.

[[File:Frankenstein Cooke 1823.jpg|thumb|right|The actor [[Thomas Cooke (actor)|T. P. Cooke]] as Frankenstein's Monster in an 1823 stage production of the novel]]
''[[Frankenstein]]'' by [[Mary Shelley]], while not a zombie novel in particular, prefigures many 20th-century ideas about zombies in that the resurrection of the dead is portrayed as a scientific process rather than a mystical one, and that the resurrected dead are degraded and more violent than their living selves. ''Frankenstein'', published in 1818, has its roots in European folklore,&lt;ref&gt;Warner, Marina. ''A forgotten gem: Das Gespensterbuch ('The Book of Ghosts'), An Introduction''&lt;/ref&gt; whose tales of vengeful dead also informed the evolution of the modern conception of the [[vampire]]. Later notable 19th-century stories about the avenging undead included [[Ambrose Bierce]]'s "[[The Death of Halpin Frayser]]", and various [[Gothic Romanticism]] tales by [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. Though their works could not be properly considered zombie fiction, the supernatural tales of Bierce and Poe would prove influential on later writers such as [[H. P. Lovecraft]], by Lovecraft's own admission.&lt;ref&gt;H. P. Lovecraft, ''Supernatural Horror in Literature'' (1927, 1933–1935)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s and early 1930s, the American horror author H. P. Lovecraft wrote several [[novella]]e that explored the undead theme. "[[Cool Air]]", "[[In the Vault]]", and "[[The Outsider (short story)|The Outsider]]" all deal with the undead, but Lovecraft's ''[[Herbert West–Reanimator]]'' (1921) "helped define zombies in popular culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.ugo.com/a/zombies-attack/?cur=favorite-zombies&amp;content=reanimator |title=When Zombies Attack! |publisher=UGO.com |date=2008-06-24 |accessdate=2013-11-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620020631/http://www.ugo.com/a/zombies-attack/?cur=favorite-zombies&amp;content=reanimator |archive-date=20 June 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This series of short stories featured [[Herbert West]], a [[mad scientist]] who attempts to revive human corpses with mixed results. Notably, the resurrected dead are uncontrollable, mostly mute, primitive and extremely violent; though they are not referred to as zombies, their portrayal was prescient, anticipating the modern conception of zombies by several decades.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] similarly depicted animated corpses in the [[Lost on Venus|second book]] of his [[Amtor|Venus series]], again without ever using the terms "zombie" or "undead".

Avenging zombies would feature prominently in the early 1950s [[EC Comics]], which [[George A. Romero]] would later claim as an influence. The comics, including ''[[Tales from the Crypt (comic)|Tales from the Crypt]]'', ''Vault of Horror'' and ''Weird Science'', featured avenging undead in the Gothic tradition quite regularly, including adaptations of Lovecraft's stories, which included "In the Vault", "Cool Air" and ''Herbert West–Reanimator''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.yankeeclassic.com/miskatonic/library/stacks/periodicals/comics/lovecraft/comics1.htm |title=Miskatonic University library - H.P. Lovecraft in the Comics |publisher=Yankeeclassic.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Matheson]]'s 1954 novel ''[[I Am Legend (novel)|I Am Legend]]'', although classified as a vampire story would nonetheless have definitive impact on the zombie genre by way of [[George A. Romero]]. The novel and its 1964 film adaptation, ''[[The Last Man on Earth (1964 film)|The Last Man on Earth]]'', which concern a lone human survivor waging war against a world of vampires, would by Romero's own admission greatly influence his 1968 low-budget film ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'';&lt;ref name="Clasen"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Clasen|first=Mathias|year=2010|title=Vampire Apocalypse: A Biocultural Critique of Richard Matheson's I Am Legend|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/philosophy_and_literature/v034/34.2.clasen.html|work=Philosophy and Literature}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Biodrowsk"&gt;Biodrowski, Steve. [http://www.hollywoodgothique.com/nightofthelivingdead.html "''Night of the Living Dead'': The classic film that launched the modern zombie genre"]&lt;/ref&gt; a work that would prove to be more influential on the concept of zombies than any literary or cinematic work before it.

===In film and television===
{{see also|Zombie film}}
Films featuring zombies have been a part of cinema since the 1930s, with ''[[White Zombie (film)|White Zombie]]'' (directed by [[Victor Hugo Halperin|Victor Halperin]] in 1932) being one of the earliest examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.best-horror-movies.com/review?name=white-zombie-1932-review|title=White Zombie (1932) Review|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150912172727/http://www.best-horror-movies.com/review?name=white-zombie-1932-review|archivedate=12 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; With [[George A. Romero|George A.

Voodoo-related zombie themes have also appeared in espionage or adventure themed works outside the horror genre.  For example, the original "[[Jonny Quest]]" series (1964) and the [[James Bond]] novel and movie ''[[Live and Let Die (novel)|Live and Let Die]]'' both feature Caribbean villains who falsely claim the voodoo power of zombification in order to keep others in fear of them.

The modern conception of the zombie owes itself almost entirely to [[George A. Romero]]'s 1968 film ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]''.&lt;ref name="PM"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Harper, ''Night of the Living Dead: Reappraising an Undead Classic''. Bright Lights Film Journal, Issue 50, November 2005.

T. |editor-last=Joshi |location=Westport, Connecticut |publisher=Greenwood Press |year=2007 |isbn=0313337802 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his films, Romero "bred the zombie with the vampire, and what he got was the hybrid vigour of a ghoulish plague monster".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=James B. |last=Twitchell |title=Dreadful Pleasures: An Anatomy of Modern Horror |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1985 |isbn=0195035666 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This entailed an apocalyptic vision of monsters that have come to be known as [[Living Dead#Romero's versus O'Bannon's zombies|Romero zombies]].

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' chided theater owners and parents who allowed children access to the film. "I don't think the younger kids really knew what hit them," complained Ebert. "They were used to going to movies, sure, and they'd seen some horror movies before, sure, but this was something else." According to Ebert, the film affected the audience immediately:&lt;blockquote&gt;"The kids in the audience were stunned. There was almost complete silence. The movie had stopped being delightfully scary about halfway through, and had become unexpectedly terrifying. There was a little girl across the aisle from me, maybe nine years old, who was sitting very still in her seat and crying."&lt;ref name="Ebertreview"&gt;Roger Ebert, review of ''Night of the Living Dead'', Chicago ''Sun-Times'', January 5, 1969, at [http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-night-of-the-living-dead-1968 RogerEbert.com]; last accessed July 8, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Romero's reinvention of zombies is notable in terms of its thematics; he used zombies not just for their own sake, but as a vehicle "to criticize real-world social ills—such as government ineptitude, bioengineering, slavery, greed and exploitation—while indulging our post-apocalyptic fantasies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greencine.com/static/primers/zombies1.jsp |title=Zombies |publisher=GreenCine |date= |accessdate=2013-11-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714132607/http://www.greencine.com/static/primers/zombies1.jsp |archive-date=14 July 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Night'' was the first of six films in Romero's [[Living Dead#Romero's Dead series|''Living Dead'' series]]. Its first sequel, ''[[Dawn of the Dead (1978 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]'', was released in 1978.

[[Lucio Fulci]]'s ''[[Zombi 2]]'' was released just months after ''Dawn of the Dead'' as an ersatz sequel (''Dawn of the Dead'' was released in several other countries as ''Zombi'' or ''Zombie'').&lt;ref name="PM"/&gt;

====1980s and 1990s====
The 1981 film ''[[Hell of the Living Dead]]'' referenced a mutagenic gas as a source of zombie contagion: an idea also used in [[Dan O'Bannon]]'s 1985 film ''[[Return of the Living Dead]]''. ''Return of the Living Dead'' featured zombies that hungered specifically for brains.

The mid-1980s produced few zombie films of note. Perhaps the most notable entry, ''[[The Evil Dead]]'' series, while highly influential are not technically zombie films but films about [[demonic possession]], despite the presence of the undead. 1985's ''[[Re-Animator]]'', loosely based on the Lovecraft story, stood out in the genre, achieving nearly unanimous critical acclaim,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/reanimator/?critic=columns |title=Re-Animator |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |date= |accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and becoming a modest success, nearly outstripping Romero's ''[[Day of the Dead (1985 film)|Day of the Dead]]'' for box office returns.

After the mid-1980s, the subgenre was mostly relegated to the underground. Notable entries include director [[Peter Jackson|Peter Jackson's]] ultra-gory film ''[[Braindead (1992 film)|Braindead]]'' (1992) (released as ''Dead Alive'' in the U.S.), [[Bob Balaban|Bob Balaban's]] comic 1993 film ''[[My Boyfriend's Back (1993 film)|My Boyfriend's Back]]'' where a self-aware high school boy returns to profess his love for a girl and his love for human flesh, and Michele Soavi's ''[[Dellamorte Dellamore]]'' (1994) (released as ''Cemetery Man'' in the U.S.). Several years later, zombies experienced a renaissance in low-budget Asian cinema, with a sudden spate of dissimilar entries including ''[[Bio Zombie]]'' (1998), ''[[Wild Zero]]'' (1999), ''[[Junk (film)|Junk]]'' (1999), ''[[Versus (2000 film)|Versus]]'' (2000) and ''[[Stacy (film)|Stacy]]'' (2001).

====Zombie apocalypse====
{{main|Zombie apocalypse}}

Intimately tied to the concept of the modern zombie is the "zombie apocalypse"; the breakdown of society as a result of an initial zombie outbreak that spreads. This [[archetype]] has emerged as a prolific subgenre of [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|apocalyptic fiction]] and has been portrayed in many zombie-related media after ''Night of the Living Dead''.&lt;ref name="Paffenroth"&gt;{{cite book |first=Kim |last=Paffenroth |title=Gospel of the Living Dead: George Romero's Visions of Hell on Earth |location=Waco |publisher=Baylor University Press |year=2006 |isbn=1932792651 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a zombie apocalypse, a widespread (usually global) rise of zombies hostile to human life engages in a general assault on civilization. Victims of zombies may become zombies themselves. This causes the outbreak to become an exponentially growing crisis: the spreading phenomenon swamps normal military and law enforcement organizations, leading to the panicked collapse of civilized society until only isolated pockets of survivors remain, scavenging for food and supplies in a world reduced to a pre-industrial hostile wilderness. Possible causes for zombie behavior in a modern population can be attributed to viruses, bacteria or other phenomena that reduce the mental capacity of humans causing them to behave in a very primitive and destructive fashion. &lt;!--"Pre-industrial" is correct. "Post-industrial" is something completely different; see [[Post-industrial society]].--&gt;

====Subtext====
The usual subtext of the zombie apocalypse is that civilization is inherently vulnerable to the unexpected, and that [[Misanthropy|most individuals if desperate enough cannot be relied on to comply with the author's ethos]]. The narrative of a zombie apocalypse carries strong connections to the turbulent social landscape of the United States in the 1960s, when ''Night of the Living Dead'' provided an indirect commentary on the dangers of conformity, a theme also explored in the novel ''[[The Body Snatchers]]'' (1954) and associated film ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]'' (1956).&lt;ref name="Rockoff"&gt;{{cite book |first=Adam |last=Rockoff |title=Going to Pieces: The Rise and Fall of the Slasher Film, 1978–1986 |location=Jefferson, NC |publisher=McFarland |year=2002 |page=35 |isbn=0-7864-1227-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Zombie Movies |title=The Encyclopedia of Fantasy |editor1-first=John |editor1-last=Clute |editor2-first=John |editor2-last=Grant |location=New York |publisher=St. Martin's Press |year=1999 |page=1048 |isbn=0-312-19869-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many also feel that zombies allow people to deal with their own anxieties about the end of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/film-and-tv/features/preview-max-brooks-festival-of-the-living-dead-barbican-london-422481.html |title=Preview: Max Brooks' Festival of the (Living) Dead!

Due to a large number of thematic films and video games, the idea of a zombie apocalypse has entered the mainstream, and many fans have begun making efforts to prepare for the hypothetical future zombie apocalypse. Such efforts include creating weapons and selling educational material informing people how to survive a zombie outbreak; while most of these are tongue-in-cheek and do not represent an authentic belief that a zombie apocalypse in the near future is likely,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/geekdad/2008/12/10-geeky-gifts/ |title=10 Geeky Gifts for Under $10 |accessdate=13 February 2011 |first=Michael |last=Harrison |date=5 December 2008 |publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|''Wired'']]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dealsofthedead.com/ |title=Zombie Costumes |accessdate=13 February 2016 |first=Paddy |last=Cohen |date=13 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention#CDC zombie apocalypse outreach campaign|the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have used the fictional scenario]]&lt;!--Two links to the same article in the same sentence is completely uncalled for!--&gt; to demonstrate survival and emergency-preparedness techniques that may be useful in a "real-world" setting.

====Story elements====
[[File:John A. Russo as zombie in Night of the Living Dead.JPG|thumb|[[John A. Russo]] portrays a zombie in ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]''.]]

# Initial contacts with zombies are extremely dangerous and traumatic, causing shock, panic, disbelief and possibly denial, hampering survivors' ability to deal with hostile encounters.&lt;ref name=surviving&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27770863/ |title=Surviving a zombie apocalypse: 'Left 4 Dead' writer talks about breathing life into zombie genre |accessdate=3 December 2008 |first=Todd |last=Kenreck |date=17 November 2008 |work=Video game review |publisher=[[msnbc]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The response of authorities to the threat is slower than its rate of growth, giving the zombie plague time to expand beyond containment. This results in the collapse of the given society. Zombies take full control, while small groups of the living must fight for their survival.&lt;ref name=surviving/&gt;

The stories usually follow a single group of survivors, caught up in the sudden rush of the crisis. The narrative generally progresses from the onset of the zombie plague, then initial attempts to seek the aid of authorities, the failure of those authorities, through to the sudden catastrophic collapse of all large-scale organization and the characters' subsequent attempts to survive on their own. Such stories are often squarely focused on the way their characters react to such an extreme catastrophe, and how their personalities are changed by the stress, often acting on more primal motivations (fear, self-preservation) than they would display in normal life.&lt;ref name=surviving/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://events.chicagoreader.com/events/Event?oid=852597 |title=Max Brooks |accessdate=28 October 2008 |last=Daily |first=Patrick |work=Chicago Reader |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221073910/http://events.chicagoreader.com/events/Event?oid=852597 |archivedate=21 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Romero would later opine that he believes that much of the 21st century obsessions with Zombies can be traced more towards video games than films, Noting that it was not until the 2009 film [[Zombieland]] that a Zombie film was able to grose more the 100 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Robey|first1=Tim|title=George A Romero: Why I don't like The Walking Dead|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/10436738/George-A-Romero-Why-I-dont-like-The-Walking-Dead.html|website=Telegraph|accessdate=13 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of video games, zombies frequently appear in [[collectible card game|trading card games]], such as ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'' or ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh!

The [[Brooklyn]] hip hop trio [[Flatbush Zombies]] incorporate many tropes from zombie fiction and play on the theme of a zombie apocalypse in their music.

In the 1990s, zombie fiction emerged as a distinct literary subgenre, with the publication of ''[[Book of the Dead (anthology)|Book of the Dead]]'' (1990) and its follow-up ''Still Dead: Book of the Dead 2'' (1992), both edited by horror authors [[John Skipp]] and Craig Spector. Featuring Romero-inspired stories from the likes of [[Stephen King]], the ''Book of the Dead'' compilations are regarded as influential in the horror genre and perhaps the first true "zombie literature". Horror novelist [[Stephen King]] has written about zombies including his short story "[[Home Delivery (short story)|Home Delivery]]" (1990) and his novel ''[[Cell (novel)|Cell]]'' (2006) concerning a struggling young artist on a trek from Boston to [[Maine]] in hopes of saving his family from a possible worldwide outbreak of zombie-like maniacs.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The New York Times]]'', 12 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Max Brooks]]'s novel ''[[World War Z]]'' (2006) became a [[New York Times bestseller]].&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'', 15 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks had previously authored  ''[[The Zombie Survival Guide]]'' (2003), a zombie-themed parody of pop-fiction survival guides published in 2003.&lt;ref name="USA Today"&gt;Craig Wilson, "Zombies lurch into popular culture via books, plays, more," ''[[USA Today]]'', 9 April 2009, p. 1D (1st page of Life section, [[above the fold]]), found at [https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2009-04-08-zombies-pop-culture_N.htm Zombies lurch into popular culture article at USA Today]. Retrieved 13 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks has said that zombies are so popular because "Other monsters may threaten individual humans, but the living dead threaten the entire human race.... Zombies are slate wipers." [[Seth Grahame-Smith]]'s mashup novel ''[[Pride and Prejudice and Zombies]]'' (2009) combines the full text of [[Jane Austen]]'s ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'' (1813) with a story about a zombie epidemic within the novel's [[British Regency]] period setting.&lt;ref name="USA Today" /&gt; In 2009, Katy Hershbereger of [[St. Martin's Press]] stated "In the world of traditional horror, nothing is more popular right now than zombies....

The zombie also appears as a metaphor in protest songs, symbolizing mindless adherence to authority, particularly in law enforcement and the armed forces. Well-known examples include [[Fela Kuti]]'s 1976 album ''[[Zombie (album)|Zombie]]'', and [[The Cranberries]]' 1994 single "[[Zombie (song)|Zombie]]".

Organized [[zombie walk]]s have been staged, either as performance art or as part of protests that parody political extremism or apathy.&lt;ref name="sosd"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/metro/20070726-9999-1n26zombies.html |title = Zombies haunt San Diego streets |accessdate =1 October 2009 |author = Colley, Jenna |publisher = signonsandiego.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="csl"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/arts/articulate/200604/s1627099.htm |title = They came, they saw, they lurched |accessdate = 1 October 2009 |author = Kemble, Gary |publisher = ABC |location = Australia |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20091004113014/http://www.abc.net.au/news/arts/articulate/200604/s1627099.htm |archive-date = 4 October 2009 |dead-url = yes |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pennyblood.com/zombiewalk1.html |title=The Dead Walk |accessdate=1 October 2009 |author=Dalgetty, Greg |work=Penny Blood magazine |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090906054540/http://www.pennyblood.com/zombiewalk1.html |archivedate=6 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="star"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/dining/31116719.html?elr=KArksD:aDyaEP:kD:aUt:aDyaEP:kD:aUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aULPQL7PQLanchO7DiU |title = Nightlife: 'Dead' ahead |accessdate =1 October 2009 |author = Horgen, Tom |publisher = StarTribune.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guin"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.yourpenntrafford.com/penntraffordstar/article/guinness-certifies-record-second-annual-zombie-walk |title = Guinness certifies record for second annual Zombie Walk |accessdate = 1 October 2009 |author = Dudiak, Zandy |publisher = yourpenntrafford.com |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090123041112/http://www.yourpenntrafford.com/penntraffordstar/article/guinness-certifies-record-second-annual-zombie-walk |archive-date = 23 January 2009 |dead-url = yes |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variation of the zombie walk is the zombie run.  Here participants do a [[5k run]] wearing a belt with several flag "lives".  If the chasing zombies capture all of the flags the runner becomes "infected".  If he or she reaches the finish line—which may involve wide detours—ahead of the zombies the participant is a "survivor".  In either case an appropriate participation medal is awarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zombierun.com/#!zombierunaboutus/c2414|title=Zombie Run Homepage|website=Zombie Run Homepage|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In theoretical academic papers===
Researchers have used theoretical zombie infections to test epidemiology modeling. One study found that all humans end up turned or dead. This is because the main epidemiological risk of zombies, besides the difficulties of neutralizing them, is that their population just keeps increasing; generations of humans merely "surviving" still have a tendency to feed zombie populations, resulting in gross outnumbering. The researchers explain that their methods of modelling may be applicable to the spread of political views or diseases with dormant infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://loe.org/images/content/091023/Zombie%20Publication.pdf |title=When Zombies Attack!: Mathematical Modelling of an Outbreak of Zombie Infection |last=Munz |first=Philip |last2=Hudea |first2=Ioan |last3=Imad |first3=Joe |last4=Smith |first4=Robert J. |format=PDF |pages=133–150 |year=2009 |access-date=9 August 2018 |isbn=978-1-60741-347-9 |publisher=[[Nova Science Publishers, Inc.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.wired.com/2009/08/zombies/ |title=Mathematical Model for Surviving a Zombie Attack |last=Tchuenche |first=J.M. |last2=Chiyaka |first2=C. |date=14 August 2009 |access-date=9 August 2018 |magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
