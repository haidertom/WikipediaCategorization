'''1880 in sports''' describes the year's events in world sport.

==[[American football]]==
'''College championship'''
* [[NCAA Division I FBS National Football Championship|College football national championship]] – [[Princeton Tigers football|Princeton Tigers]] and [[Yale Bulldogs football|Yale Bulldogs]] (shared)
'''Events'''
* [[Walter Camp]] becomes an influential figure at the Massasoit House conventions where rules are debated and changed. His 1878 proposal to reduce the teams from fifteen players to eleven is passed in 1880, the effect being to open up the game and emphasise speed over strength. Camp's most famous rule proposal, the establishment of the line of scrimmage and the snap from center to quarterback, is also passed in 1880.

==[[Association football]]==
'''England'''
* [[1880 FA Cup Final|FA Cup final]] – [[Clapham Rovers F.C.|Clapham Rovers]] 1–0 [[Oxford University A.F.C.|Oxford University]] at [[The Oval]]
* A dispute develops between [[Bolton Wanderers]] and the [[The Football Association|FA]] about [[professionalism]], a heated topic in football through the 1880s which will directly or indirectly involve many other clubs besides Bolton.  The FA espouses the so–called "Corinthian Spirit" and there are constant arguments about broken–time payments, out–of–pocket expenses and what amounts to actual wages.  Despite its convictions, the FA has no objection to professional clubs playing in the [[FA Cup]] and this may be a tacit acknowledgement that the growth of professionalism is inevitable.  There are close links at this time between football and cricket, which has employed professionals since the 17th century.  Part of the problem is that many of the amateurs see football as "fun", but cricket is taken very seriously and the professional cricketer is considered necessary.  Bolton Wanderers, formed in 1874 as a church team, has already become an ambitious club and is turning professional to attract talent from Scotland.  Its neighbour [[Blackburn Rovers]] also turns professional in 1880.
* [[Manchester City]] founded as West Gorton FC (east Manchester) by members of St Mark's Church cricket team.
'''Ireland'''
* Establishment of the [[Irish Football Association]] (IFA) in [[Belfast]] as the world's fourth oldest football association. Until the formation of the [[Football Association of Ireland]] (FAI) in 1921, the IFA administers football throughout Ireland although participation in the 19th century is mainly centred on the Belfast area. The IFA now governs football in Northern Ireland only and is not to be confused with the FAI which governs football in the Republic of Ireland.
'''Scotland'''
* [[1880 Scottish Cup Final|Scottish Cup final]] – [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]] 3–0 Thornliebank at [[Hampden Park (1873–83)|Hampden Park]]

==[[Baseball]]==
'''National championship'''
* [[National League]] champions – [[Chicago White Stockings (1870–89)|Chicago White Stockings]]
'''Events'''
* The latest National Association, a professional rival of the National League, goes out of business after its fourth season, contested by only three to four clubs.

==[[Boxing]]==
'''Events'''
* 30 May — after four years of inactivity, [[Joe Goss]] finally defends his Heavyweight Championship of America title against [[Paddy Ryan]] at Collier's Station, West Virginia.  Ryan wins after 87 rounds.&lt;ref name="PR"&gt;[http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/ryan-p.htm Cyber Boxing Zone – Paddy Ryan].  Retrieved on 12 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[John L. Sullivan]] is now the main contender for Ryan's title and announces that he will fight anyone in America, with or without gloves, for $500.&lt;ref name="JLS"&gt;[http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/sully.htm Cyber Boxing Zone – John L Sullivan].  Retrieved on 12 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==[[Cricket]]==
'''Events'''
* 6–8 September — the first ever [[Test cricket|Test match]] played in England sees [[England national cricket team|England]] defeat [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] at [[The Oval]] by 5 wickets after [[W. G. Grace]] scores England's first Test century.
'''England'''
* [[Champion County]]&lt;ref&gt;A semi-official seasonal title proclaimed by media consensus prior to December 1889 when the official County Championship is constituted.&lt;/ref&gt; –  [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Nottinghamshire]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33475">The '''age requirements in gymnastics''' are established by the [[Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique]] (FIG) and regulate the age at which athletes are allowed to participate in senior-level competitions.

In the latter half of the 20th century, a series of controversies arose with regard to gymnast ages, some of them leading to sanctions by FIG, and paving the way for the age requirements to be raised from 14 to 15 in 1981, and then to 16 in 1997.

==History of age requirements in artistic gymnastics==
{{See also|Gymnastics all-around champions by age}}

Prior to [[1981 in sports|1981]], the minimum required age to compete in senior events sanctioned by the FIG (including the [[Gymnastics at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]]) was 14.&lt;ref name=congress&gt;{{cite journal|date=September 1980 |title=Within the International Federations |journal=Olympic Review |issue=155 |pages=520 |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/OlympicInformationCenter/OlympicReview/1980/ore155/ORE155p.pdf |accessdate=2006-04-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060524213018/http://www.la84foundation.org/OlympicInformationCenter/OlympicReview/1980/ore155/ORE155p.pdf |archivedate=24 May 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest champions in women's gymnastics tended to be in their 20s; most had studied [[ballet]] for years before entering the sport. Hungarian gymnast [[Ágnes Keleti]] won individual gold medals at the age of 35 at the 1956 Olympics. [[Larisa Latynina]], the first great [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] gymnast, won her first Olympic all-around medal at the age of 21, her second at 25 and her third at 29; she became the 1958 [[World Gymnastics Championships|World Champion]] while pregnant with her daughter.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061027054302/http://www.intlgymnast.com/legends/latynina.html "Legends: Larissa Latynina"] ''International Gymnast,'' 2001&lt;/ref&gt; [[Czechoslovakia|Czech]] gymnast [[Věra Čáslavská]], who followed Latynina to become a two-time Olympic all-around champion, was 22 before she started winning gold medals at the highest level of the sport, and won her final Olympic all-around title at the age of 26.&lt;ref name="heroine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/athletes/profiles/bio_uk.asp?PAR_I_ID=16525|title=Vera Čáslavská: The heroine of Mexico|publisher=International Olympic Committee|accessdate=2008-07-01| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080703043503/http://www.olympic.org/uk/athletes/profiles/bio_uk.asp?par_i_id=16525| archivedate= 3 July 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, the average age of Olympic gymnastics competitors began to gradually decrease. While it was not unheard of for teenagers to compete in the 1960s — [[Ludmilla Tourischeva]] was sixteen at her first Olympics in [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]] — they slowly became the norm, as difficulty in gymnastics increased.

By the late 1970s, Federations occasionally requested permission to allow slightly underage athletes to compete as seniors. One such example is that of Canadian gymnast [[Karen Kelsall]], who legally competed in the [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Olympics]] at the age of 13. At the time, gymnasts had to turn 14 by the start of the Games to be eligible. Kelsall, with her December 1962 birthday, was five months shy of the requirement but was turning 14 within the Olympic year, and was granted a special exemption by the FIG to compete.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gymn.ca/athletes/women/kelsall.shtml Gymnastics Canada biography of Karen Kelsall] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603193852/http://www.gymn.ca/athletes/women/kelsall.shtml |date=2008-06-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such exemptions were not automatic, however: American gymnast [[Tracee Talavera]], who was named to the [[United States]] team for the 1979 World Championships, was deemed ineligible to compete due to her age of 12½ years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gymn-forum.net/bios/women/talavera.html List of competitive results and bio at Gymn-Forum]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rift&gt;[http://www.gymn-forum.net/Articles/NYT-Ages.html "Rift Over Underage Gymnasts"] Neil Amdur, ''The New York Times,'' December 7, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the changing demands of the sport, at the 58th Congress of the FIG, held in July 1980 just before the [[1980 Summer Olympics|Moscow Olympics]], the minimum age was raised from 14 to 15. Under this rule, which went into effect in 1981, gymnasts were required to turn at least 15 years of age in the calendar year to compete in senior-level events.&lt;ref name=congress /&gt; This age requirement remained in place until 1997, when it was raised one more year, from 15 to 16.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physsportsmed.com/issues/1997/03mar/nb_gym.htm "Female gymnasts: older—and healthier?"] ''The Physician and Sports Medicine,'' Vol. 23 No. 3, March 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fake&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1964264.stm "Romanian gymnasts faked age to compete"] BBC News/Europe, May 2, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons for age restrictions==
Age restrictions were supposedly designed not so much to level the playing field in terms of skill and physical advantages, as to protect child athletes from injury. However, critics dispute the science behind the policy and argue that the answer is to prohibit junior gymnasts from competing in senior competitions.

On the one hand, proponents such as [[Jeanne Dopbrak]], a sports medicine physician at the [[University of Pittsburgh Medical Center]], contend that "[a child athlete's] immature skeleton just isn't ready to handle the day-to-day stresses that will occur."&lt;ref name=PTRaug08/&gt; and that the stresses imposed on only partly developed muscular/skeletal system by gymnastics are almost certain to cause damage that would persist into adulthood. Proponents also point to a 16-year American study of gymnastics injuries which concluded that gymnastics is the most dangerous sport for girls, with injury rates comparable to those found in boys who play soccer, basketball and hockey.&lt;ref name=TimeApr08-08&gt;{{cite news|first=Alice |last=Park |title=Making Gymnastics Safer for Kids |url=http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1728902,00.html |publisher=Time |date=2008-04-08 |accessdate=2008-08-26 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917095227/http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0%2C8599%2C1728902%2C00.html |archivedate=17 September 2008 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FENetwork&gt;{{cite news |first=Lindsay |last=Hutton |title=Is Gymnastics Right for Your Child? |url=http://life.familyeducation.com/fitness/growth-and-development/57866.html |publisher=Family Education Network |accessdate=2008-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; An athlete whose bones are still growing is more likely than an adult to suffer skeletal injury, because the bones are more porous and the joints not yet fully formed.&lt;ref name=MBJklenerman&gt;{{cite journal|first=L.|last=Klenerman |title=ABC of Sports Medicine: Musculoskeletal Injuries in Child Athletes|url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/308/6943/1556 |journal=[[BMJ]] |date=1994-06-11 |volume=308|pages=1556–9 |accessdate=2008-08-26| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080901214552/http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/308/6943/1556| archivedate= 1 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no | doi=10.1136/bmj.308.6943.1556}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lesions, which are precursors to stress fractures, occur in 11 percent of young female gymnasts, compared to 2.3 percent of girls and women in general.&lt;ref name=MBJklenerman/&gt; The International Gymnastics Federation says that intense physical activity, such as that engaged in by gymnasts training at the elite level, affects the functioning of growth hormones, possibly causing delayed bone growth and the onset of puberty – although the body is able to recover and catch up later if given rest periods.&lt;ref name=FENetwork/&gt;

In addition, proponents contend that practicing elite sports is mentally and emotionally demanding. Young gymnasts at these levels are often pressured to perform by coaches and parents,&lt;ref name=FENetwork/&gt;&lt;ref name=lgipb /&gt; and ex-gymnasts have spoken out about behavioural and psychological problems common to the sport.&lt;ref name=NEMJletter&gt;{{cite journal |title=Physical and Emotional Problems of Elite Female Gymnasts |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/extract/335/4/281 |journal=[[The New England Journal of Medicine]] |date=1997-01-09|volume=336|pages=140–142 |accessdate=2008-08-26| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080828035013/http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/extract/335/4/281| archivedate= 28 August 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no | doi=10.1056/nejm199701093360216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current regulations==
Currently, per the 1997 regulation, gymnasts must be at least 16 years of age, or turning 16 within the calendar year, to compete in senior-level events. For the current Olympic cycle, in order to compete in the [[2016 Summer Olympics|2016 Olympics]], a gymnast must have a birth date before January 1, 2001. There is no maximum age restriction, and some gymnasts compete well into their 20s. The oldest female gymnast currently competing in senior international events is Uzbekistan's [[Oksana Chusovitina]],&lt;ref name="ageless"&gt;{{cite web

===Terminology===
The term '''senior''', in gymnastics, refers to any world-class gymnast who is age-eligible under F.I.G. rules. The term '''junior''' is used to describe any gymnast who competes at a world-class level, but does not meet the F.I.G.'s age minimum. Juniors are judged under the same '''Code of Points''' as the seniors, and often exhibit the same level of difficulty in their routines.

===Legal exceptions===
The one exception to the F.I.G.'s age restrictions until recently applied to the year before the Olympics, when gymnasts who were one year below the required age, but would be the required age in the Olympic year, were allowed to compete as seniors at the World Championships and other FIG meets. For instance, gymnasts born in 1977 were allowed to compete at senior events in 1991, when they were 14 or turning 14 within the calendar year. Within the last Olympic cycle, gymnasts born in 1992 were permitted to compete as seniors in 2007. This was permitted to allow nations to qualify to the Olympics with their best teams, and to give emerging gymnasts some experience in major competition before the Olympics. However, the FIG eliminated this exception as of the 2012 Olympic cycle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/olympics/2007-12/04/content_6297534.htm "Age limits for gymnasts may be set after 2008"] Xinhua News Service, December 4, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the age requirement technically only applies to meets which are sanctioned and regulated directly by the FIG: the Olympics, the World Championships and the World Cup circuit. Many other meets, such as the European Championships, have separate divisions for juniors. Additionally, some competitions, such as the [[Pan-American Games|Pan Am Games]], the Pacific Rim Championships and the [[All-Africa Games]], have different rules which permit seniors and juniors to compete together. There are also numerous international competitions specifically limited to junior gymnasts, such as the Japan Junior International, Moscow World Stars, the Junior Pan American Championships, and the Youth Olympic Games.

===Verification procedures===
According to official statements from the FIG, "the accepted proof of a gymnast’s eligibility for competition is a valid passport issued by the country of residence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gymnast Age Limitations |url=http://209.20.80.25/vsite/vcontent/content/news/0,10869,5195-191062-208285-45462-288055-news-item,00.html |publisher=NIS FIG Office |date=2008-08-09 |accessdate=2008-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821201538/http://209.20.80.25/vsite/vcontent/content/news/0%2C10869%2C5195-191062-208285-45462-288055-news-item%2C00.html |archivedate=2008-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This verification process has been criticized by some in the gymnastics community, with the argument that countries can manufacture and submit falsified documents for underage athletes.&lt;ref name=apaug2&gt;{{cite news |first=Nancy |last=Armour |title=More questions about Chinese gymnasts' ages|url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5i0x9UJBzQoVxo1MCC90C2ihzkH8QD92ARRC84 |publisher=Associated Press |date=2008-08-02 |accessdate=2008-08-02| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080817032305/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5i0x9UJBzQoVxo1MCC90C2ihzkH8QD92ARRC84| archivedate= 17 August 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nytnew /&gt;&lt;ref name=ind&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/olympics/athletics/tweddle-the-loser-as-age-doubts-mar-hes-triumph-901736.html|title=Tweddle the loser as age doubts mar He's triumph|publisher=''The Independent''|author=Harris, Nick|date=2008-08-19|accessdate=2008-08-19| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080819122617/http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/olympics/athletics/tweddle-the-loser-as-age-doubts-mar-hes-triumph-901736.html| archivedate= 19 August 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In several cases, gymnasts involved in age falsification have verified that they did in fact compete under forged passports provided to them by their federations.&lt;ref name=secrets&gt;''The Secrets of a Gymnast.''

Since 2009, gymnasts competing in FIG-sanctioned events at both the senior and junior level have been required to have licenses issued by the Federation. These licenses reportedly verify the competitors' ages based on their passports. However, the licensing does not include any independent verification of submitted passport information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/printedition/la-sp-olygymchina10-2008aug10,0,3941558.story |title=More age monitoring for women's gymnastics |publisher=''Los Angeles Times'' |author=Pucin, Diane |date=2008-08-10 |accessdate=2008-08-16 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080815004923/http://www.latimes.com/sports/printedition/la-sp-olygymchina10-2008aug10%2C0%2C3941558.story |archivedate=15 August 2008 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response from coaches and federations===
The age limit is arguably one of the most contentious rules in gymnastics, and is frequently debated by coaches, gymnasts and members of the media. While some members of the sport, such as former [[USA Gymnastics]] president Bob Colarossi, have expressed support for the age limit of 16, others, such as coach [[Béla Károlyi]], have heavily criticized it.&lt;ref name=old&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4191/is_20000914/ai_n9976865 "Gymnasts are Old-lympians/Golden Girls going for gold in Sydney"] Paula Parrish, ''Colorado Springs Gazette,'' September 14, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of the age restrictions have pointed out that it has encouraged older gymnasts to remain in the sport. The average age of an international gymnast was 18.10 years in 2005. In contrast, in 1994, before the new age requirements, it was 16.49, and in 1989, gymnasts who had reached the age of 17 were already often considered to be of retirement age.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aipsmedia.com/index.php?page=news&amp;cod=830&amp;tp=n "Gymnasts too young? FIG says the rumor is false"] International Sports Press Association, February 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/01/opinion/topics-of-the-times-gymnastic-girls-not-women.html "Gymnastic Girls, Not Women"] ''The New York Times'', August 1, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of the rule have countered that by barring younger gymnasts from top level meets, they are denying them valuable competitive experience.&lt;ref name=old /&gt; They have also argued that junior gymnasts perform and are scored under the same ''Code of Points'' as the seniors, perform the same skills, and are thus not avoiding the physical impact of training and performing high-level skills. It is also argued that the current ''Code of Points'', with its increased requirements for difficult skills, is more suited to younger and lighter athletes, and puts older athletes at greater risk of injury.&lt;ref name=nytnew&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/27/sports/olympics/27gymnasts.html?_r=2&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin "Issues of Age Seem to Follow Chinese Gymnasts"] Jere Longman, Juliet Macur. ''The New York Times,'' July 27, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Age falsification==&lt;!-- This section is linked from redirect "[[Age falsification in gymnastics]]" --&gt;
Age falsification is the practice of [[age fabrication|advancing gymnasts' ages]] to make them age-eligible for senior-level competition. Reports of age falsification among top-level international gymnasts first began to surface in the 1980s, after the age limit was raised from 14 to 15. This has frequently taken the form of inconsistently reported birthdates; at other times, speculation has been raised due to the young appearance of the gymnasts.&lt;ref name=fake /&gt;&lt;ref name=nytnew /&gt; Age falsification has been revealed and confirmed in several ways. In some cases, gymnasts themselves have come forward and publicly confirmed and verified the falsification.&lt;ref&gt;Daniela Silivas, Alexandra Marinescu, Yang Yun, Lavinia Agache, Olga Mostepanova&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, documents revealing inconsistencies, such as original birth certificates, have been researched and uncovered by the press.&lt;ref&gt;Gina Gogean&lt;/ref&gt; Inconsistencies with reported birth dates and ages at international and national competitions have also led to the discovery of age falsification.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Gwang Suk, Lavinia Agache, Olga Bicherova&lt;/ref&gt;

Gymnasts who have had their ages falsified, and have spoken about their experiences, have indicated that they were not given a choice in the matter.&lt;ref name=secrets /&gt; In a 2002 interview, Romanian gymnast [[Daniela Silivaş]], whose age was advanced two years in the 1980s, noted: "One of the officials of the Federation told me 'Look at the passport, from today you're not 13 years old anymore but 15.' Nobody asked me if I agreed to this, I was just a child. They needed gold medals and everybody who was involved in gymnastics knew about these practices."&lt;ref name=prosport /&gt;

While age falsification has been denied among many gymnastics officials, in recent years some have publicly admitted that the practice has occurred. In reference to the falsifications of the early 1990s and 1980s, the head of the [[Romania]]n Gymnastics Federation, Nicolae Vieru, was quoted in 2002: "Changing the ages was a worldwide practice...we copied this from others."&lt;ref name=fake /&gt; The FIG has publicly stated that they view age falsification as an unacceptable practice. However, there have only been three cases, those of [[Kim Gwang Suk]] in 1993 and [[Dong Fangxiao]] and [[Hong Su Jong]] in 2010, where the FIG has elected to take any action against a gymnastics federation for age falsification.&lt;ref name=nytnew /&gt;&lt;ref name=fangxiao /&gt;

===Reasons for age falsification===
According to many scientific and medical studies, as well as reports from ex-gymnasts, younger gymnasts may have psychological or physical advantages in elite gymnastics competition.

Psychologically, younger gymnasts may be more fearless, and have less visceral appreciation for the potential for injury. They are therefore more likely to perform more dangerous, and more highly scored, routines with confidence and steadiness.&lt;ref name=PTRaug08&gt;{{cite news |first=Dan |last=Stefano |title=China gymnast underage, AP alleges |url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/sports/s_583045.html |publisher=Pittsburgh Tribune-Review |date=2008-08-15 |accessdate=2008-08-26 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080823113905/http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/sports/s_583045.html |archivedate=2008-08-23 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; “Psychologically, I think they worry less,” former Olympic medallist [[Nellie Kim]] told ''The New York Times''.&lt;ref name=NYTjuly27-08&gt;{{cite news |first=Jeré and Juliet Macur |last=Longman |title=Records Say Chinese Gymnasts May Be Under Age |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/27/sports/olympics/27gymnasts.html |publisher=The New York Times |date=2008-07-27 |accessdate=2008-08-26| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081210163814/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/27/sports/olympics/27gymnasts.html| archivedate=December 10, 2008&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daniela Silivaş, in her interview, commented, "You should know that I competed better at the age of 13 than at 17. I felt much better, physical ''(sic)'' and mentally."&lt;ref name=prosport /&gt;

Physically, younger gymnasts, particularly those who have not yet gone through [[puberty]], tend to be lighter, smaller, more pliable and flexible, which aids them in performing more complex skills and gives them a better strength-to-weight ratio. When a gymnast hits puberty, growth spurts and weight gain may affect her centre of gravity, causing mental and physical stress as she must adjust, and in some cases relearn, her moves to compensate.&lt;ref name=PTRaug08/&gt;&lt;ref name=cbbc&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |title=Row over ages of winning gymnasts |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/newsid_7570000/newsid_7576600/7576667.stm |publisher=BBC/CBBC Newsround |date=2008-08-22 |accessdate=2008-08-26| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081005084514/http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/newsid_7570000/newsid_7576600/7576667.stm| archivedate= 5 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller athletes have generally excelled in the more challenging acrobatic elements required by the evolving [[Code of Points (artistic gymnastics)|Code of Points]] after the 1960s.&lt;ref name=lgipb&gt;{{cite book | last = Ryan | first = Joan | title = Little Girls in Pretty Boxes | publisher = Doubleday | location = Garden City | year = 1995 | isbn = 978-0-385-47790-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, older gymnasts may be more prone to certain types of injuries caused by overuse of bones and muscles; younger gymnasts are less likely to have such problems, or more likely to be able to work through pain while injured.&lt;ref name=PTRaug08/&gt;&lt;ref name=lgipb /&gt;

===Major verified cases of age falsification===
'''[[Kim Gwang Suk]]''' ([[North Korea]]): Kim, the 1991 World Champion on the [[uneven bars]], was active on the international circuit between 1987 and 1993. During this time, several observers claimed she was too young for senior competition.  The North Korean Gymnastics Federation submitted inconsistent dates of birth for Kim at various competitions, claiming that she was 15 for three consecutive years. As punishment, the F.I.G. barred the North Korean women's team from the World Championships in 1993.  She competed in the [[1989 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|1989 World Championships]] at the estimated age of 11 or 12.&lt;ref name="iht"&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/1996/04/19/gym.t.php "Gold Medalist and His Team May Be Barred From Olympic Games : Last Chance for a North Korean Athlete"] Christopher Clarey, ''International Herald Times,'' Friday, April 19, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;  However, she may have been younger than that.  At the 1992 Olympics, she claimed she was 17.  However, her front teeth were missing, leading [[Béla Károlyi]] to speculate that she may have been as young as 10 at the time.&lt;ref&gt;NBC coverage of the 1992 Olympics team compulsories&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, her blog stated she was born during the Year of the Ox, which would place her birthdate between February 1985 and February 1986.

Her 2010 F.I.G. license and 2010 Worlds registration indicated that she was born in 1989.

The '''Beach Volleyball Database''' is an online [[website]] that holds extensive information about international [[beach volleyball]] players, tournaments and history. News are frequently updated, and the site has results for [[continent]]al and [[international]] tournaments. It is the only website of its kind in the sport of beach volleyball.

The press operations officer for the [[Association of Volleyball Professionals|AVP]], Tim Simmons, has said that the Beach Volleyball Database has had a major impact on the sport. Information that is now easily accessible through the website, used to take time consuming research through different sources. Now professional athletes have a chance to set long-term goals based on their long-term results in comparison to other professional beach volleyball players.&lt;ref name=keck&gt;Alan Keck, [http://www.bvbinfo.com/news.asp?ID=399 Beach Volleyball: Fan is a one-man, on-line encyclopedia on the sport], [[The Virginian Pilot]], 2002 (Beach Volleyball Database)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bleachers.jpg|thumb|220px|Wooden bleachers]]

'''Bleachers''', or '''stands''', are raised, tiered rows of benches found at [[sports]] fields and other spectator events.  Stairways provide access to the horizontal rows of seats, often with every other step gaining access to a row of benches.

Benches range from simple planks to elaborate ones with backrests.  Many bleachers are open to the ground below so that there are only the planks to sit and walk on. Some bleachers have vertical panels beneath the benches, either partially or completely blocking the way to the ground.

== Name origins ==
The open seating area in baseball was called the "bleaching boards" as early as 1877.&lt;ref name=seymour/&gt; The term "bleachers" used in the sense of benches for spectators can be traced back to at least 1889;&lt;ref name=etymonline/&gt; named as such because the generally uncovered wooden boards were "bleached by the sun".&lt;ref name=etymonline/&gt;&lt;ref name=oed_bleacher3/&gt;

''The Dickson Baseball Dictionary'' lists as a ''secondary'' definition the fans sitting in them. By the early 1900s, the term "bleachers" was being used for both the seating area and its occupants.

In modern usage, the term "bleachers" almost always refers only to the seating area, and those sitting there may be called "bleacher fans," or "bleacherites." Terms such as [[Chicago]]'s "bleacher bums," or [[Yankee Stadium]]'s [[Bleacher Creatures]] are also used.

== Types ==

Bleacher structures vary depending on the location, but most outdoor modern bleachers have either an aluminium tube or steel angle understructure (known as frame-type bleachers) or steel I-beams (known as an I-beam bleacher). Most smaller bleachers are frame-type bleachers and most larger bleachers are I-Beam bleachers. Bleachers range in size from small, modular, aluminum stands that can be moved around soccer or hockey fields to large permanent structures that flank each side of an [[American football]] field. Some bleachers have locker rooms underneath them. In indoor gyms, bleachers can be built in so that they slide on a track or on wheels and fold in an [[accordion]]-like, stacking manner. These type of bleachers are known as telescoping bleachers.

== Baseball ==

In baseball stadiums, the bleachers are usually located beyond the outfield fences. However, center-field bleachers are located in the line of sight of the batter, and the presence of fans makes it difficult for the batter to pick out the ball.  As a result, most stadiums have vacant areas or black backgrounds where the seats would be.  This is known as either the "Backdrop" or the [[Batter's eye]].  The old [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] featured black-painted vacant bleachers, nicknamed ''the black'' by baseball fans.

Though many stadiums offer only bleacher seating, in those that offer both seats and bleachers, the bleachers are typically in less desirable locations and/or have lower ticket prices, giving the term "bleachers" a connotation of lower-class seating.

== American Football ==

The popularity of American football has made seating on outdoor and indoor football fields a necessity. Professional football, colleges, high schools, and even middle schools have bleacher systems set up to accommodate their fans. They vary in size from 10 feet wide that seat 25 all the way to full stadiums that seat thousands and wrap around the entire field. It is not uncommon to see football bleachers that rise hundreds of feet into the air. American Football bleachers are commonly made from concrete or aluminum with concrete footings or superstructure underneath.

{{essay-like|date=January 2015}}
'''Cheating''' is the receiving of a reward for ability or finding an easy way out of an unpleasant situation by dishonest means. It is generally used for the breaking of rules to gain unfair advantage in a competitive situation. This broad definition will necessarily include acts of bribery, [[cronyism]], [[nepotism]], sleaze and any situation where individuals are given preference using inappropriate criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csuh.iii.com/search~S0?/X(cheating+)&amp;SORT=D/X(cheating+)&amp;SORT=D&amp;SUBKEY=(cheating+)/1%2C63%2C63%2CB/frameset&amp;FF=X(cheating+)&amp;SORT=D&amp;8%2C8%2C |title=California State University, East Bay |publisher=Csuh.iii.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rules infringed may be explicit, or they may be from an unwritten code of conduct based on [[morality]], [[ethics]] or [[Convention (norm)|custom]], making the identification of cheating conduct a potentially subjective process. Cheating can refer specifically to [[infidelity]]. Someone who is known for cheating is referred to as a ''cheat'' in [[British English]], and a ''cheater'' in [[Comparison of American and British English|American English]]. A person described as a "cheat" doesn't necessarily cheat all the time, but rather, relies on deceiving tactics to the point of acquiring a reputation for it.

==Academic==
{{Main article|Academic dishonesty}}
[[File:Cheating.JPG|thumb|A small [[cheat sheet]] can be used to cheat during an academic examination.]]

[[Academic]] cheating is a significantly common occurrence in high schools and colleges in the United States. Statistically, 64% of public high school students admit to serious test cheating. 58% say they have [[plagiarized]]. 95% of students admit to some form of cheating. This includes tests, copying homework, and papers. Only 50% of private school students, however, admit to this. The report was made in June 2005 by [[Rutgers University]] professor Donald McCabe for The Center for Academic Integrity. The findings were corroborated in part by a [[Gallup survey]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.academicintegrity.org/icai/integrity-3.php&lt;/ref&gt; In McCabe's 2001 of 4500 high school students, "74% said they cheated on a test, 72% cheated on a written work, and 97% reported to at least had copied someone's homework or peeked at someone's test. 1/3 reported to have repeatedly cheated."&lt;ref&gt;The Case of the Purloined Paper by Brigid Schulte&lt;/ref&gt; The new revolution in high-tech digital info contributes enormously to the new wave in cheating: online term-paper mills sell formatted reports on practically any topic; services exist to prepare any kind of homework or take online tests for students, despite the fact that this phenomenon, and these websites, are well known to [[educator]]s &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiomatyc.org/web_documents/newsletter_fall_09.pdf |title=Ohiomatyc.org |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110202253/http://www.ohiomatyc.org/web_documents/newsletter_fall_09.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;; [[MP3]] players can hold digitalized notes; [[graphing calculators]] store formulas to solve math problems.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Reader's Digest]]'', pp. 123-7, March 2006; Cheating: "but everybody is doing it".&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chinese civil service examination|Chinese civil service examinations]], the main route to career success for literate men in imperial China, was bedeviled for centuries by rampant cheating and examiner-bribery, as detailed in books like the Ming-dynasty ''[https://cup.columbia.edu/book/the-book-of-swindles/9780231178631 Book of Swindles]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Type 20: Corruption in Education," in Zhang Yingyu, ''The Book of Swindles: Selections from a Late Ming Collection'', translated by Christopher Rea and Bruce Rusk (New York, NY: Columbia University Press, 2017), pp. 142-163.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sport, games and gambling ==

=== Sports ===
{{Main article|Unsportsmanlike conduct}}
Cheating in sports is the intentional breaking of rules in order to obtain an advantage over the other teams or players. Sports are governed by both customs and explicit rules regarding acts which are permitted and forbidden at the event and away from it. Forbidden acts frequently include performance-enhancing drug taking (known as "[[Doping in sport|doping]]"), using equipment that does not conform to the rules or altering the condition of equipment during play, and deliberate harassment or injury to competitors.
[[File:Lance Armstrong--2002--w.jpg|thumb|Lance Armstrong]]
High-profile examples of alleged doping cheating include [[Lance Armstrong]]'s use of [[steroid]]s in professional [[cycling]] - particularly controversial as it is widely suspected that a high percentage of professional cyclists are using prohibited substances - [[Ben Johnson (sprinter)|Ben Johnson]]'s disqualification following the [[100 metres]] final at the [[1988 Summer Olympics]], and admissions of [[steroid]] use by former professional baseball players after they have retired, such as [[José Canseco]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2005-02-13-canseco-60minutes_x.htm |title=Canseco:Steroids made my baseball career possible |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=2005-02-17 |accessdate=2009-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ken Caminiti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/videoplus/news/2002/05/29/si_steroids_video_archive/ |title=Sports Illustrated:Steroids in baseball |publisher=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date=2002-06-23 |accessdate=2009-11-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226205128/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/videoplus/news/2002/05/29/si_steroids_video_archive/ |archivedate=2009-02-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A famous sporting scandal involving cheating via harassment and injury occurred in 1994 in [[figure skating]] when [[Tonya Harding]]'s ex-husband, Jeff Gillooly, and her bodyguard Shawn Eckhardt, hired Shane Stant to break [[Nancy Kerrigan]]'s leg to remove her from the year's competitions and prevent her from competing with Harding. One of the most famous instances of cheating involving a prohibited player action occurred during the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]] quarter-final, when [[Diego Maradona]] [[Hand of God goal|used his hand to punch the ball]] into the goal of [[England national football team|England]] [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] [[Peter Shilton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2005/writers/mark_bechtel/08/24/daily.blog/index.html |title=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |publisher=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date=2005-08-24 |accessdate=2009-11-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814051451/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2005/writers/mark_bechtel/08/24/daily.blog/index.html |archivedate=2009-08-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the hand or arm by anyone other than a goalkeeper is illegal according to the rules of association football.

Illegally altering the condition of playing equipment is frequently seen in bat sports such as [[baseball]] and [[cricket]], which are heavily dependent on equipment condition. For example, in baseball, a [[pitcher]] using a [[Spitball|doctored baseball]] (e.g. putting [[graphite]] or [[Petroleum jelly|Vaseline]] on the baseball), or a [[batting (baseball)|batter]] using a [[corked bat]] are some examples of this. [[Tennis]] and [[golf]] are also no strangers to equipment cheating, with players being accused of using rackets of illegal string tension, or golf clubs of illegal weight, size, or make. Equipment cheating can also occur via the use of external aids in situations where equipment is prohibited - such as in [[American football]] via the use of [[stickum]] on the hands of receivers, making the ball easier to catch. An example of this is Hall of Famer Jerry Rice, who admitted to regularly &amp; illegally using "stickum" throughout his career, calling into question the integrity of his receiving records.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/25061154/jerry-rice-admitted-to-cheating-just-days-before-calling-pats-cheaters&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nj.com/giants/index.ssf/2015/02/whos_cheating_now_jerry_rice_admits_stickum_use_af.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nfl-shutdown-corner/jerry-rice-calls-out--cheating--patriots-but-admitted-to-using-stickum-200324269.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Athletic cheating is a widespread problem. For example, in [[professional bodybuilding]], cheating is now estimated to be so universal that it is now considered impossible to engage in professional competition without cheating and the use of supposedly banned substances; bodybuilders who refuse to take banned substances now compete in [[natural bodybuilding]] leagues.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Cheating may also be seen in [[coaching]]. One of the most common forms of this is the use of [[bribery]] and [[Kickback (bribery)|kickbacks]] in the player recruitment process. {{citation needed|date=April 2018}}Such practices are widespread all across athletics, and are particularly visible in [[college sports]] recruitment. Another common form of cheating in coaching is profiteering in association with [[gambling|gamblers]] and [[match fixing]] (see also the section below on cheating in the gambling industry). The most famous coach of the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]] Runnin' Rebels basketball team, [[Jerry Tarkanian]], was accused of both recruitment fraud and gambling fraud over the course of his career and was the subject of intense [[NCAA]] scrutiny. Another form of this involves a team coach or other manager undertaking [[corporate espionage]] or another form of prohibited spying in order to obtain details about other teams' strategies and tactics. The [[2007 New England Patriots videotaping controversy]], in which the [[New England Patriots]] were found to have videotaped an opposing team from an unapproved location while trying to obtain defensive signals. As was the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] use of, at the time legal, performance enhancers. However, there was cheating proven by the [[Denver Broncos]] during their back to back titles in the late 90's to circumvent the league's salary cap and obtain and retain players that they would otherwise not have been able to. Circumvention of rules governing conduct and procedures of a sport can also be considered cheating. During the [[2007 Formula One Season]], driver [[Fernando Alonso]] was labelled a "cheat" for exchanging confidential information between the teams of [[Scuderia Ferrari]] and [[Mclaren]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/article293761.ece |title=Fernando is just a 'cheat' |publisher=thesun.co.uk |date=2007-09-15 |accessdate=2010-03-21 |location=London |first=Michael |last=Spearman |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114233444/http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/article293761.ece |archivedate=2012-01-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a form of [[collusion]]. 

An example of cheating via judging collusion occurred in the [[2002 Winter Olympics figure skating scandal]] when the Russian team was awarded a gold medal over the Canadian team in an alleged vote-swapping judging deal; the Canadian team's silver medals were eventually upgraded to gold at a second awards ceremony and the French judge was suspended for misconduct. The head of the French skating federation was later also suspended, and both were banned from the 2006 Olympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/1959181.stm | work=BBC News | title=Three-year Ban for Skating Judge | date=April 30, 2002 | accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Skating Union]] modified its [[ISU Judging System|judging system]] as a result of this case. 

Cheating is also used to refer to movements in [[strength training]] that transfer weight from an isolated or fatigued muscle group to a different or fresh muscle group. This allows the cheater to move an initial greater weight (if the cheating continues through an entire training set) or to continue exercising past the point of muscular exhaustion (if the cheating begins part way through the set). As strength training is not a sport, cheating has no rule-based consequences, but can result in injury or a failure to meet training goals. This is because each exercise is designed to target specific muscle groups and if the proper form is not used the weight can be transferred away from the targeted group.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

=== Video games ===
{{Main article|Cheating in video games}}
[[File:Action Replay Amiga500.jpg|thumb|The [[Action Replay]] card allows Amiga computer owners to cheat in videogames]]
In video games, cheating can take the form of secret access codes in single-player games (such as the [[Konami code]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/cheats/games/gradius-nes-6035|title=Gradius Cheats &amp; Codes|publisher=IGN|language=English|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) which unlock a bonus for the player when entered, [[hacking (computers)|hacks]] and exploits which give players an unfair advantage in online multiplayer games and single-player modes, or unfair [[collusion]] between players in online games (such as a player who spectates a match, removing limitations such as "[[fog of war]]", and reports on enemy positions to game partners).

Attitudes towards cheating vary. Using exploits in single-player modes is usually considered to be simply another form of exploring the game's content unless the player's accomplishments are to be submitted competitively, and is common in single-player games with a high difficulty level; however, cheating in multiplayer modes is considered immoral and harshly condemned by fair players and developers alike. On one hand, cheating allows casual players to complete games at much-accelerated speed, which can be helpful in some cinematic or one-player games, which can take a subjectively long time to finish, as is typical of the [[Role-Playing Game]] (RPG) genre. While this may be seen as a hasty advantage causing no damage to anyone, in a multi-player game such as [[MMORPG]]s the repercussions of cheating are much more damaging, breaking the risk/reward curve of the game and causing fair players to lose online matches and/or character development. Cheating in those types of games is generally prohibited - though often widespread anyway. In many circles, the purchasing of items or currency from sources outside the game is also considered to be cheating. The [[Terms of Service#Video games|Terms of Service]] from many games where this is possible, directly prohibits this activity. {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} One area where there is little consensus as of yet involves modern [[Free-to-play]] business models which support and are supported by the exchange of real-world money for in-game services, items, and advantages. Games that grant excessive advantages only available to paying customers may be criticized as being 'Pay to win'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2012/08/13/separating-free-to-play-and-pay-to-win |title=Separating Free-to-Play and Pay-To-Win |publisher=IGN.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; - sometimes considered a form of "cheating" that is actually legitimatized by the system - whilst games that limit real-money purchases to cosmetic changes are generally accepted as fair.

Another form of video game cheating is when a player does things to interact with game objects that are unforeseen by the programmers and break the intended function or reward system of the object. This can involve the way enemies are encountered, objectives met, items used, or any other game object that contains a [[software bug]]. One common example is the exploitation of errors in an enemy's [[pathfinding]]; if a player can cause an enemy to become "stuck" in a given terrain feature, that player can then usually dispatch the enemy from a distance without risk, even if much stronger, and achieve greater rewards than the player is intended to be able to at that level of progression. Another example was common in early [[first-person shooter]] games and involved skipping a weapon's reload timer by quickly switching weapons back and forth without actually reloading the weapons; resulting in what was effectively instant reloading. It also can be accomplished through means of altered game files are substituted for the normal files, or image graphics changed to permit greater visibility of the targets, etc. - for example, replacing the colors on a dark-colored enemy intended to blend in with the background with a bright color permitting instant visibility and targeting. Generally speaking, there is often some concern that this is not truly cheating, as it is the fault of the programmers that such an exploit exists in the first place. However, technically, as with live sports, it is cheating if the player is not playing the game in a formally approved manner, breaking unwritten rules. In some cases, this behavior is directly prohibited by the Terms of Service of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csuh.iii.com/record=b2293396~S0 |title=California State University, East Bay |publisher=Csuh.iii.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gambling ===
[[File:Georges de La Tour - Cheater with the Ace of Diamonds - WGA12334.jpg|thumb|''Cheater with the [[Ace of Diamonds]]'', by [[Georges de La Tour]]]]
{{see also|Cheating in casinos}}

The wagering of money on an event extends the motivation for cheating beyond directly participating competitors. As in sport and games, cheating in [[gambling]] is generally related to directly breaking rules or laws, or misrepresenting the event being wagered on, or interfering in the outcome.
A boxer who takes a dive, a [[casino]] which plays with secretly [[loaded dice]], a rigged [[roulette wheel]] or [[slot machine]], or a [[doctored deck of cards]], are generally regarded as cheating, because it has misrepresented the likelihood of the game's outcomes beyond what is reasonable to expect a bettor to protect himself against. However, for a bookmaker to flatter a horse in order to sell bets on it at shorter [[odds]] may be regarded as [[salesmanship]] rather than cheating, since bettors can counter this by informing themselves and by exercising [[skepticism]].
Doping a horse is a clear example of cheating by interfering with the instruments of the event under wager. Again, not all interference is cheating; spending money to support the health and well-being of a horse one has wagered on is not in itself generally regarded as cheating, nor is improving the morale of a sportsman one has backed by [[cheering]] for them. Generally, interference is more likely to be regarded as cheating if it diminishes the standard of a sporting competition, damages a participant, or modifies the apparatus of the event or game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csuh.iii.com/record=b2175166~S0 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130629123454/http://csuh.iii.com/record=b2175166~S0 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-06-29 |title=California State University, East Bay |publisher=Csuh.iii.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the world of gambling, knowing a secret which is not priced into the odds gives a significant advantage, which may give rise to a perception of cheating. However, legal systems do not regard secretly making use of knowledge in this way as criminal deception in itself. This is in contrast to the financial world, where people with certain categories of relationship to a company are restricted from transacting, which would constitute the crime of [[insider trading]]. This may be because of a stronger presumption of equality between investors, or it may be because a company employee who also trades in the company's stock has a conflict of interest, and has thus misrepresented himself the company.
An [[advantage play]]er typically uses mental, observational or technical skills to choose when and how much to bet, and neither interferes with the instruments of the game nor breaks any of its rules. Representatives of the [[casino]] industry have claimed that all [[advantage play]] is cheating, but this point of view is reflected neither among societies in general nor in legislation. As of 2010, the only example anywhere of a type of advantage play being unlawful is for an advantage player to use an auxiliary device in the U.S. State of [[Nevada]], whose legislation is uniquely influenced by large casino corporations. Nonetheless it remains a widely held principle that the law should not impose any restraint over the method by which a player arrives at a playing or betting decision from information held by him lawfully and which he is not debarred from under the rules of the game. In "hole carding", a casino player tries to catch sight of the front of cards which are dealt face-down according to the rules.
One way of cheating and profiting through gambling is to bet against yourself and then intentionally lose. This is known as [[match fixing|throwing a game or taking a dive]]. Illegal gamblers will at times pay sports players to lose so that they may profit from the otherwise unexpected loss. An especially notorious case is the [[Black Sox Scandal]], when eight players of the 1919 Chicago White Sox took payment from gamblers and intentionally played poorly. Another happened in [[boxing]] when [[Jake LaMotta]] famously took a dive against Billy Fox in order to obtain his entry to a championship match against [[Marcel Cerdan]], a deal offered by the mobsters who controlled professional boxing.

== Business ==

Various [[Trade regulation|regulation]]s exist to prevent unfair competitive advantages in business and finance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://definitions.uslegal.com/u/unfair-competitive-advantage-energy/|title=unfair-competitive-advantage-energy (law)}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example [[competition law]], or the prohibition of [[insider trading]].

The most extreme forms of cheating (e.g. attempting to gain money through outright deceit rather than providing a service) are referred to as [[fraud]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8751">A '''comparison of [[baseball]] and [[softball]]''' can be made as softball is directly descended from baseball. An observer of one game would find the other very similar, but there are several important rule differences.

[[Fastpitch softball]] is more popular in competitive leagues, especially at the college and international tournament levels, while slow pitch is more popular in recreational [[sports league|league]]s where the relative skill levels of different players may vary widely. The different rules of slowpitch can be viewed as maintaining a competitive balance for less skilled players by eliminating certain strategies (e.g., base stealing and bunting) which require a high level of skill to counter. Additionally, recreational leagues may impose their own ground rules, either for competitive balance or to meet local constraints (e.g., a time limit may be imposed on a game to ensure multiple games can be played in one day).

'''Compression garments''' are pieces of clothing that fit tightly around the skin. In medical contexts, compression garments provide support for people who have to stand for long periods or have poor [[Circulatory system|circulation]]. These come in varying degrees of compression, and higher degree compression sleeves, such as sleeves that provide compression of 20–30 mmHg or higher, typically require a doctor's prescription.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|year = 2016 |url = http://www.seattlecca.org/shine/oncology-products/compression-garments/about-compression-sleeves-and-garment#3 |title = Seattle Cancer Care Alliance| publisher = seattlecca.org | accessdate = 2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compression garments worn on the legs can help prevent [[deep vein thrombosis]] and reduce swelling, especially while traveling.

In sports, form-fitting compression sportswear, usually made of [[spandex]], is commonly worn by athletes and in exercise to prevent [[Chafing (skin)|chafing]] and [[rash]]es.

==Maternity==
A '''bellyband''', '''wrap''', or '''abdominal binder''' is a compression garment which resembles a [[tubetop]] worn over the abdomen of expectant mothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Curtis |first=Glade B. |last2=Schuler |first2=Judith |display-authors=1 |ref={{harvid|Curtis &amp; al.}} |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=4z__CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA414 414] |title=Your Pregnancy: Week by Week, ''8th ed.'' |date=2016 |publisher=Da Capo Press }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Belly wraps are also very commonly worn postpartum. Belly wraps are typically prescribed for abdominal support, making it easier for people with back pain to perform day to day tasks, as well as to help mothers with their posture and potential back problems post delivery.

==Stockings==
{{main|Compression stockings}}
Compression stockings are specialized hosiery designed to help prevent the occurrence of and guard against further progression of various medical disorders.

80 years ago, a pair of lady's stockings began the "age of synthetics." &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/how-75-years-ago-nylon-stockings-changed-world-180955219/|title=How 75 Years Ago Nylon Stockings Changed the World|last=Cutlip|first=Kimbra|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2017-05-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Museum of American History holds the experimental stockings that were created in 1937 to test the viability of the first man-made fiber that was created entirely in a lab.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Nylon was thought to have the strength of steel and the sheerness of cobwebs. These stockings became a very hot commodity when they were first released for public purchase. Their demand was so high that four million pairs sold in the first four days.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Nylon's impact on fashion was immediate, but the invention sparked a revolution. Nylon's original name was fiber-66.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Stockings became so important to a woman's image that, during World War II, when stockings were not being sold because all nylon was diverted to military use, women began painting their legs with makeup, trying to create the image of nylon stockings.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Sportswear==
[[File:Chiara Simionato in action (08-12-2007) 3.jpg|thumb|A speedskater in a bodysuit]]
[[File:Grand Slam Moscow 2012, Set 2 - 022.jpg|thumb|A beach volleyball player in tights]]
Compression sportswear is usually worn by athletes, including shirts, shorts, [[tights]], sleeves, socks, or underwear. They are [[form-fitting garment]]s often made from a [[spandex]]-type material.

One small study of compression shorts found no change in sprint time, but found some gait changes that might reduce injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/0264041031000101971 |vauthors=Doan BK, Kwon YH, Newton RU |title=Evaluation of a lower-body compression garment |journal=J Sports Sci |volume=21 |issue=8 |pages=601–10 |date=Aug 2003 |pmid=12875311 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another study of calf sleeves found no change in sprint times and gait; larger reviews have found no evidence that compression garments can improve athletic performance beyond the [[placebo effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/2015/04/11/398929121/compression-clothes-advantage-could-be-placebo-effect | title=Compression Clothes' Advantage Could be Placebo Effect}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through testing repeat-sprint and throwing performance in cricket players, one study found that there was a significant difference by way of higher mean skin temperature, lower 24-hour post exercise [[Creatine kinase|CK]] values and lower 24-hour post exercise ratings of muscle soreness when wearing compression garments. However, the study failed to find any significant difference in sprint performance, throwing performance, heart rate, or various blood tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=17341589 |year=2007 |author1=Duffield |first2=M |last3=Edge |title=Comparison of three types of full-body compression garments on throwing and repeat-sprint performance in cricket players |volume=41 |issue=7 |pages=409–14; discussion 414 |doi=10.1136/bjsm.2006.033753 |journal=British Journal of Sports Medicine |first3=J.|last2=Portus |pmc=2465357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In materials testing, the compressive garment provided increased flexion and extension, which could help reduce hamstring injuries. They also reduced impact by 27% compared to American football pants alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12875311 |year=2003 |author1=Doan |first2=YH |last3=Newton |first3=RU |last4=Shim |first4=J |last5=Popper |first5=EM |last6=Rogers |first6=RA |last7=Bolt |first7=LR |last8=Robertson |first8=M |last9=Kraemer |first9=WJ |title=Evaluation of a lower-body compression garment |volume=21 |issue=8 |pages=601–10 |journal=Journal of Sports Sciences |doi=10.1080/0264041031000101971|last2=Kwon  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that compressive garments can improve long term vertical jump height.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Abstract/1996/08000/Influence_of_Compression_Garments_on_Vertical_Jump.9.aspx|title=Influence of Compression Garments on Vertical Jump Performan... : The Journal of Strength &amp; Conditioning Research|work=LWW|access-date=2017-05-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the material used, compression garments can be designed to keep athletes cool or warm depending on the requirements of the sport.  This is why you will see both athletes in the winter and summer olympics wearing similar looking compression outfits.  For example, speedskaters can wear compression bodysuits in the cold rink, while beach volleyball players can wear a similar-looking piece made out of a more breathable, lightweight blend.  Both athletes will use moisture wicking materials such as nylon and spandex to keep them lightweight, while cotton would retain moisture and weigh them down in action.  In addition, speed skaters take advantage of the aerodynamic advantage they can get from wearing a skintight suit, while a beach volleyball player has the added benefit of SPF 50+ garments to keep them protected on a sunny day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/fitness/workouts/268-compressed-for-success|title=The compression clothing phenomenon - Women's Health &amp; Fitness|website=www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The athletes pictured show the diverse range of benefits that make compression garments so popular in a wide range of sports and designs.

Other purported benefits of compression sportswear are:
*Keeping the muscles warm to prevent muscle strain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.berkeleywellness.com/fitness/active-lifestyle/article/skinny-compression-shorts|title=Benefits of Wearing Compression Shorts|website=@berkeleywellness|access-date=2017-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shorts and tights===
Compression shorts and tights are [[underwear|undergarments]] usually worn by athletes.  They are [[form-fitting garment]]s and when worn, cover the athlete's waist to mid or lower thigh, similar to [[cycling shorts]].
[[File:Hurdler.jpg|thumb|Hurdler in full compression uniform]]
More recently, [[jockstrap]]s have declined in popularity with young male athletes, and garments such as compression shorts have seen an increase in popularity, arguably because of their comparable function and less embarrassing looks.  Many are available with a [[Jockstrap#Protective cup|cup pocket]], a sewn-in pocket that can hold a protective cup.  It is arguable that compression shorts do not keep cups in the proper position, tight to the body and not moving, as a jockstrap can.  Some players wear the compression shorts over the traditional jockstrap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2123007/|title=Where have all the jockstraps gone?|work=Slate Magazine (2005-07-22)|date=2005-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compression shorts are also popular among female athletes, especially among those who wear [[skirts]] or [[kilts]] during games. In those situations, athletes wear compression shorts under the skirt so if they fall over and their skirts ride up, their underwear will not be exposed. This is seen particularly in [[women's lacrosse]] and [[field hockey]] (both being limited contact sports in which players often wear skirts). In this situation, compression shorts are colloquially identified as [[spandex]] shorts.  Women also wear compression shorts in tennis, where, most recently, compression shorts have been produced with ball pockets for convenience.

=== Post-workout benefit ===
Compression garments have been shown to help athletes during the active recovery process. Research shows that following a high intensity treadmill workout, compression garments helped to decrease the heart rate and lactic acid buildup in athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lovell|first=Dale I.|last2=Mason|first2=Dale G.|last3=Delphinus|first3=Elias M.|last4=McLellan|first4=Christopher P.|date=2011-12-01|title=Do compression garments enhance the active recovery process after high-intensity running?|journal=Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research|volume=25|issue=12|pages=3264–3268|doi=10.1519/JSC.0b013e31821764f8|issn=1533-4287|pmid=22082795|citeseerx=10.1.1.671.5841}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a study by Duffield R. and M. Portis, although there were few observed changes during their event, cricket players wearing compression garments showed fewer blood markers of muscle damage and reported less soreness during the 24-hour post-workout period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duffield|first=Rob|last2=Portus|first2=Marc|date=2007-07-01|title=Comparison of three types of full-body compression garments on throwing and repeat-sprint performance in cricket players|journal=British Journal of Sports Medicine|volume=41|issue=7|pages=409–414; discussion 414|doi=10.1136/bjsm.2006.033753|issn=1473-0480|pmc=2465357|pmid=17341589}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have supported the idea that compression garments are effective in reducing post-workout declines in jump height, minimizing strength loss, decreasing swelling, and easing muscle soreness after competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.active.com/running/articles/is-compression-gear-really-effective?page=3|title=Is Compression Gear Really Effective?|date=2012-12-11|work=ACTIVE.com|access-date=2017-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9696">'''Computer science in sport''' is an interdisciplinary discipline that has its goal in combining the theoretical as well as practical aspects and methods of the areas of [[Information technology|informatics]] and [[sport science]]. The main emphasis of the [[interdisciplinarity]] is placed on the application and use of computer-based but also mathematical techniques in sport science, aiming in this way at the support and advancement of theory and practice in sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Link |first1=D. |last2=Lames |first2=M. |title=Sport Informatics - Historical Roots, Interdisciplinarity and Future Developments |journal=International Journal of Computer Science in Sport |date=2009 |volume=Volume 8 |issue=Edition 2 |pages=68-87}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason why [[computer science]] has become an important partner for sport science is mainly connected with "the fact that the use of data and media, the design of models, the analysis of systems etc. increasingly requires the support of suitable tools and concepts which are developed and available in computer science".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Arnold Baca |title=Computer science in sport: an overview of history, present fields and future applications (part I) |year=2006}} IJCSS Special Edition 2/2006, 25-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical background ==
Going back in history, computers in sports were used for the first time in the 1960s, when the main purpose was to accumulate sports information. [[Database]]s were created and expanded in order to launch documentation and dissemination of publications like articles or books that contain any kind of knowledge related to sports science. Until the mid-1970s also the first organization in this area called IASI (International Association for Sports Information) was formally established. Congresses and meetings were organized more often with the aim of standardization and rationalization of sports documentation. Since at that time this area was obviously less computer-oriented, specialists talk about sports information rather than sports informatics when mentioning the beginning of this field of science.

Based on the progress of computer science and the invention of more powerful computer hardware in the 1970s, also the real history of computer science in sport began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jürgen Perl |title=Computer science in sport: an overview of history, present fields and future applications (part II) |year=2006}} IJCSS Special Edition 2/2006, 36-46.&lt;/ref&gt; This was as well the first time when this term was officially used and the initiation of a very important evolution in sports science.

In the early stages of this area statistics on biomechanical data, like different kinds of forces or rates, played a major role. Scientists started to analyze sports games by collecting and looking at such values and features in order to interpret them. Later on, with the continuous improvement of computer hardware - in particular microprocessor speed – many new scientific and computing paradigms were introduced, which were also integrated in computer science in sport. Specific examples are [[Computer model|modeling]] as well as [[simulation]], but also [[pattern recognition]], design, and (sports) [[data mining]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bahadorreza Ofoghi |author2=John Zeleznikow |author3=Clare MacMahon |author4=Markus Raab |title=Data mining in elite sports: A review and a framework |year=2013 |journal=Measurement in Physical Education and Exercise Science | volume=17 | issue=3 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1091367X.2013.805137#.VI-ipE103Dc |doi=10.1080/1091367X.2013.805137 |pages=171–186}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Iztok Fister Jr. |author2=Karin Ljubič |author3=Ponnuthrai Nagaratnam Suganthan |author4=Matjaž Perc |author5=Iztok Fister |title=Computational intelligence in sports: Challenges and opportunities within a new research domain |year=2015 |journal=Applied Mathematics and Computation | volume=262 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0096300315004300 |doi=10.1016/j.amc.2015.04.004 |pages=178–186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As another result of this development, the term 'computer science in sport' has been added in the encyclopedia of sports science in 2004.

== Areas of research ==
The importance and strong influence of computer science as an interdisciplinary partner for sport and sport science is mainly proven by the research activities in computer science in sport. The following IT concepts are thereby of particular interest:

* [[Data acquisition]] and [[data processing]]
* Databases and [[expert system]]s
* Modelling (mathematical, IT based, biomechanical, physiological)
* Simulation (interactive, animation etc.)
* Presentation

Based on the fields from above, the main areas of research in computer science in sport include amongst others:

* [[Training]] and coaching
* [[Biomechanics]]
* [[Sports equipment]] and technology
* Computer-aided applications (software, hardware) in sports
* [[Ubiquitous computing]] in sports
* [[Multimedia]] and [[Internet]]
* Documentation
* Education

== Research communities ==
A clear demonstration for the evolution and propagation towards computer science in sport is also the fact that nowadays people do research in this area all over the world. Since the 1990s many new national and international organizations regarding the topic of computer science in sport were established. These associations are regularly organizing congresses and workshops with the aim of dissemination as well as exchange of scientific knowledge and information on all sort of topics regarding the interdisciplinary discipline.

=== Historical survey ===
As a first example, in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] scientists have built up the MathSport group of [[ANZIAM]] (Australia and New Zealand Industrial and Applied Mathematics), which since 1992 organizes biennial meetings, initially under the name "Mathematics and Computers in Sport Conferences", and now "[[MathSport]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anziam.org.au/MathSport MathSport], www.anziam.org.au&lt;/ref&gt; Main topics are mathematical models and computer applications in sports, as well as coaching and teaching methods based on informatics.

The European community was also among the leading motors of the emergence of the field. Some workshops on this topic were successfully organized in Germany since the late 1980s. In 1997 the first international meeting on computer science in sport was held in Cologne. The main aim was to spread out and share applications, ideas and concepts of the use of computers in sports, which should also make a contribution to the creation of internationalization and thus to boost research work in this area.

Since then, such international symposia took place every two years all over Europe. As the first conferences were a raving success, it was decided to go even further and the foundation of an organization was the logical consequence. This step was accomplished in 2003, when the International Association of Computer Science in Sport (IACSS) was established during the 4th international symposium in Barcelona, when Prof. Jürgen Perl was also chosen as the first president. A few years earlier, the first international e-journal on this topic (International Journal of Computer Science in Sport) was released already. The internationalization is confirmed moreover by the fact that three conferences already took place outside of Europe - in [[Calgary]] ([[Canada]]) in 2007, [[Canberra]] ([[Australia]]) in 2009 and [[Shanghai]] ([[China]]) in 2011. During the symposium in Calgary additionally the president position changed - it has been assigned to Prof. Arnold Baca, who has been re-elected in 2009 and 2011. The following Symposia on Computer Science in Sport took place in Europe again, in [[Istanbul]] ([[Turkey]]) in 2013 and in [[Loughborough]] ([[UK]]) in 2015. In 2017 the 11th Symposium of Computer Science in Sport took place in [[Constance]] ([[Germany]]). During the conference in Istanbul Prof. Martin Lames was elected as president of the IACSS. He was re-elected in 2015 and 2017.

=== National organizations ===
In addition to the international associations from above, currently the following national associations on computer science in sport exist (if available, the web addresses are also given):

* Austrian Association of Computer Science in Sport - http://www.sportinformatik.at
* British Association of Computer Science in Sport and Exercise

[[Image:SidBarnesHeadshot.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sid Barnes]] wearing a cricket cap]]

A '''cricket cap''' is a type of soft [[cap]], often made from [[felt]], that is a traditional form of headwear for players of the game of [[cricket]], regardless of age or gender. It is usually a tight-fitting skullcap, usually made of six or eight sections, with a small crescent shaped brim that points downwards over the brow to provide shade for the eyes. It is often, but not always, elasticised at the rear to hold it in place upon the wearer's head. Sometimes, rather than tight-fitting, the cricket cap comes in a baggy variety, that is always kept in place by elastic.

==Description==
The style of cap is also often used as official headwear as part of [[school uniforms]] for boys from private schools, particularly in the United Kingdom and throughout the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. Although not common in the modern period, the cricket cap used to be a fashionable form of headwear for people who were casually dressed, and not necessarily worn just for playing the game.

Cricket caps are usually, but not always multi-coloured in the colours of the [[cricket club]] or school for which the cap is designed to represent. Sometimes they are particularly elaborately patterned with different sections in different colours, or different coloured rings or hoops around them. At international level, the cap is traditionally made from a single colour. However, in recent years in particular, many cricket teams, particularly for [[limited overs cricket]] have opted to wear [[baseball caps]], rather than traditional cricket caps, but the style is still quite popular for [[first-class cricket]] teams, as well as [[Test cricket]] sides.

The origins of the cricket cap are hard to discern, however prints showing the game being played in the eighteenth century, already depict players wearing a variety similar versions of the traditional cricket cap.

[[Image:Englandcricketcaptraditional.jpg|thumb|Traditional England cricket cap. The cap is made of dark blue wool. There are eight panels, with the ECB ensignia at the front. Unlike the Australian style, in the English cap the wool is not baggy and the visor narrower and longer. In this image, the slight 'bagginess' is because it is not being worn]]

Perhaps the most famous version of the cricket cap in the modern setting is the [[baggy green]] cricket cap of the [[Australian cricket team]], for which the players and fans of Australia hold a degree of reverence.&lt;ref name=CC1&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Cricket in 100 Objects|isbn =978-1846689406 |author=Gavin Mortimer|date=2013|publisher= Serpent's Tail}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cap is treated with a degree of [[mysticism]], and players who have long careers often refuse to replace the original one they receive as they often feel the cap is a lucky talisman. This sometimes results in players who have long careers wearing their cricket caps in quite a tattered state. The Australian side has long worn their baggy cricket cap, rather than alternatives such as a [[sun hat]], for the first session of each match as a symbol of team solidarity.

Players who represent first-class or Test match cricket sides are often presented with a cap ceremonially before their debut. This is called "receiving their first cap". The [[England Cap Numbers|cap is numbered]] according to how many players have represented that side before them. For example, Indian cricketer [[Sachin Tendulkar]] was the 187th player to represent India at Test level, and was awarded cap number 187. It is also sometimes used to refer to the number of times a player has played. Tendulkar played 200 Tests for India, so therefore he is said to have received 200 caps. While an actual cap may not necessarily be presented on every occasion, ceremonial cap presentations are often made for milestone appearances such as a player's 50th or 100th Test, in addition to debuts.

'''Cricket diplomacy''' consists of using the game of [[cricket]] as a political tool to enhance or worsen the diplomatic relations between two [[List of International Cricket Council members|cricket playing nations]]. Cricket is the second-most widely played game in the world after [[association football|football]], and is thus used as a political tool to bridge the gap in the diplomatic vacuum.

==Australia and England==
{{main|The Ashes}}
The [[Bodyline]] controversy was detrimental to relations between England and Australia. The situation escalated into a diplomatic incident between the countries as the MCC—supported by the British public and still of the opinion that their ''fast leg theory'' tactic was harmless—took serious offence at being branded "unsportsmanlike" and demanded a retraction. Many people saw bodyline as fracturing an international relationship that needed to remain strong.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, pp. 241&amp;ndash;259.&lt;/ref&gt; Jardine, and by extension the entire English team, threatened to withdraw from the fourth and fifth Tests unless the Australian Board withdrew the accusation of unsporting behaviour.&lt;ref name="p259"&gt;Pollard, p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frith, p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; Public reaction in both England and Australia was outrage directed at the other nation. The Governor of South Australia, [[Alexander Hore-Ruthven, 1st Earl of Gowrie|Alexander Hore-Ruthven]], who was in England at the time, expressed his concern to British [[Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs]] [[James Henry Thomas]] that this would cause a significant impact on trade between the nations.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, pp. 242&amp;ndash;248.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="p2601"/&gt; The standoff was settled only when Australian prime minister [[Joseph Lyons]] met with members of the Australian Board and outlined to them the severe economic hardships that could be caused in Australia if the British public boycotted Australian trade. Given this understanding, the Board withdrew the allegation of unsportsmanlike behaviour two days before the fourth Test, thus saving the tour.&lt;ref name="p2601"&gt;Pollard, pp. 260&amp;ndash;261.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frith, pp. 255&amp;ndash;259.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were significant consequences for Anglo-Australian relations, which remained strained until the outbreak of World War II made cooperation paramount. Business between the two countries was adversely affected as citizens of each country displayed a preference for not buying goods manufactured in the other. Australian commerce also suffered in British colonies in Asia: the ''North China Daily News'' published a pro-bodyline editorial, denouncing Australians as sore losers. An Australian journalist reported that several business deals in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Shanghai]] were lost by Australians because of local reactions.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, p. 382.&lt;/ref&gt;

English immigrants in Australia found themselves shunned and persecuted by locals, and Australian visitors to England were treated similarly.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, p. 383.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934–35 a statue of [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Prince Albert]] in Sydney was vandalised, with an ear being knocked off and the word "BODYLINE" painted on it.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt;

==India and Pakistan==
{{Main|India–Pakistan cricket rivalry}}
Cricket has also had a hand to play in sporting diplomacy. Following the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]], and Soviet pressure on India to deflect the tension they faced, in 1987 Pakistan's president at the time, General [[Zia ul-Haq]], attended a test match between India and Pakistan in Jaipur - a visit that apparently helped cool a flare-up in tensions. Furthermore, in 2004 after a break of fifteen years, India toured Pakistan in the wake of diplomatic initiatives to bury half a century of mutual hostility. Both sides relaxed their tough visa regulations for each other, allowing thousands of fans to travel across the border.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/03/10/business/singh.php&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to replicate the cricket diplomacy of the past General [[Pervez Musharraf]] came to India in 2005 ostensibly for a cricket match. The trip, however, quickly took on the air of a summit as the sides were urged "to seize a historic chance to end their dispute over Kashmir."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-04/17/content_434859.htm Musharraf visits India amid cricket diplomacy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-04/19/content_435617.htm|title=India, Pakistan cricket diplomacy no game it's real|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often this rivalry has been tinged with a religious-political bent to it. In 1991, the workers of the [[List of political parties in India|Indian political party]] [[Shiv Sena]] dug up the cricket pitch at the [[Wankhede Stadium]] in [[Mumbai]] on the eve of an India-Pakistan [[Test cricket|Test match]] which was to be held there, forcing the entire series between the two nations to be cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontline.in/navigation/?type=static&amp;page=flonnet&amp;rdurl=fl1602/16020280.htm|title=Navigation News - Frontline|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2012/20121101/main4.htm|title=The Tribune, Chandigarh, India - Main News|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Shiv Sena once again used this unique means of protest at the [[Feroz Shah Kotla]] in [[New Delhi]] in 2000 to protest against the Pakistan cricket team's proposed visit.&lt;ref name="update.unu.edu"&gt;[http://update.unu.edu/archive/issue31_2.htm UNU Update: Cricket Diplomacy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821122824/http://update.unu.edu/archive/issue31_2.htm |date=21 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Kargil conflict]], and at various other times, there have also been calls to suspend cricketing ties between the two countries.

During the [[2011 Cricket World Cup]], [[2011 Cricket World Cup Semifinal: India v Pakistan|the semifinal]] is believed to have eased the relationship between India and Pakistan after the polarising 2008 Mumbai attacks. Prime Minister of India [[Manmohan Singh]] used this opportunity and greeted his Pakistani counterpart [[Yousuf Raza Gilani]] to watch the match with him at Mohali. Gilani subsequently accepted the offer and agreed to watch the match with Singh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/site/Video/133811/44/india-vs-pakistan-pakistan-prime-minister-yousuf-raja-gilani-arrives-in-chandigarh.html|title=- Video - Pak PM Gilani arrives in Chandigarh - Sports Videos - - India Today|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/site/Video/133816/44/india-vs-pakistan-india-to-play-semi-final-match-against-pakistan-in-mohali.html|title=- Video - 'Cricket brings India Pak together' - Sports Videos - - India Today|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani has requested Indian govt. to allocate a cricket stadium for Afghanistan Cricket team in India. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.theindiantalks.com/featured/modi-should-engage-in-cricket-diplomacy-with-afghanistan/4697/ | work=The Indian Talks | title=Modi Should Engage in Cricket Diplomacy with Afghanistan | date=25 April 2015 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150425213015/http://www.theindiantalks.com/featured/modi-should-engage-in-cricket-diplomacy-with-afghanistan/4697/ | archivedate=25 April 2015 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==England and Zimbabwe==
In 2008, the [[England and Wales Cricket Board]] cancelled [[Zimbabwe cricket team|Zimbabwe]]'s 2009 tour of England, and the [[Government of the United Kingdom]] subsequently suspended all bilateral relations between the two states in response to the situation regarding the [[Zimbabwean presidential election, 2008|2008 Zimbabwean presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=England cut Zimbabwe cricket ties |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/7471238.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=25 June 2008 |accessdate=2008-09-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  MPs [[Jack Straw]] and [[Tessa Jowell]] wrote to the [[International Cricket Council]] asking them to ban Zimbabwe from international cricket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/other_international/zimbabwe/4170262.stm | work=BBC News | title=Zimbabwe is facing new ban threat | date=21 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==China and Taiwan==
Extending a form of [[cultural diplomacy]] popularly called [[stadium diplomacy]], China has also joined cricket diplomacy. [[Cross-Strait relations]] have been the impetus for doing so. During the buildup to the [[2007 Cricket World Cup|2007 World Cup]], [[Antigua]] received a $55 million grant to build the [[Sir Vivian Richards Stadium]], while Jamaica received $30 million for a new [[Greenfield Stadium (Trelawny)|Trelawny]] stadium. [[St. Lucia]] also built both a cricket and a football stadium courtesy of China. China spent a remarkable $132 million on cricket facilities in the West Indies over the past few years, compared to the [[International Cricket Council]]'s 10-year budget of $70 million to promote cricket globally. The diplomacy paid off in the end as [[Grenada]] and [[Dominica]] derecognized Taiwan as an independent country. Further, "Of the remaining 24 countries that recognize Taiwan, four are in the Caribbean and two of these play cricket."{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} Grenada previously had a stadium built by Taiwan, but saw it flattened by a hurricane. To join the action, China quickly came in to erect another stadium. Consequently, Taiwan took Grenada to a New York City court to force the latter to return the original loan.

Taiwan also used the World Cup to shore up its position among its shrinking West Indian support base. It doled out $21 million to [[St. Kitts and Nevis]] and $12 million to the even smaller [[St. Vincent and the Grenadines]] for cricket grounds. China's aggressive ambitions have benefited the [[Caribbean Islands]] as "Strategic analysts say China is laying out more money than is needed to just isolate Taiwan. China, which has built large embassies in each of the islands, now has a bigger diplomatic presence in the Caribbean than the United States, the superpower next door." And that "Mainland China's long-term strategy coincides with its foreign policy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/Story?id=2980988&amp;page=1|title=China Outplays Taiwan in Cricket Diplomacy|author=ABC News|work=ABC News|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:XTERRA - Fort Custer, 2008.jpg|thumb|right|Triathletes lined up ready to start the swimming stage in a cross triathlon in 2008.]]
'''Cross triathlon''', or '''Off-road triathlon''', is a form of [[triathlon]], or three-stage race, consisting of a [[human swimming|swim]] stage, [[mountain bike|mountain-biking]] stage, and a [[cross country running|trail-running]] stage.

Cross triathlons are distinguished from conventional triathlons in that the terrain for the [[cycling]] and running stages are generally unpaved, rough, and hilly. They require different techniques than conventional triathlon races, and in particular the athletes employ mountain bikes rather than road bikes.

A cross triathlon requires a higher degree of technical biking skill, as opposed to the high speed and endurance demands of road biking in a road triathlon.  Distances for the bike portion of an off-road are much less relevant than for a road triathlon. An off-road bike course may have several severe climbs and descents. It may also have a high degree of technicality, meaning the number, pitch and sharpness of turns through trees, rocks, logs, streams and other obstacles on the bike trail. Because the vertical climbs and technical demands of an off-road course greatly reduce a biker's speed, and because the amount of climbing and technicality vary greatly from one off-road course to another, estimating times for an off-road bike course merely by distance is not reliable.

Cross triathlon swim courses are normally similar to those of road triathlons. Each type of triathlon usually requires competitors to swim a minimum of 800 meters and typically 1500 meters in a lake, river or ocean.

Off-road run courses often follow part of the off-road bike course, and so often require trail running up and down hills or mountain sides, through forests, streams, riverbeds and other natural and occasionally man-made obstacles. The run distance is at least 5 kilometers and normally 10 kilometers. Again, as in off-road biking, predicting a finish time purely based on distance will not be accurate, due to the climbing and trail turns and obstacles preventing a runner from reaching speeds usually achieved on the road.

The [[International Triathlon Union]] conducts an annual Cross Triathlon Championship race annually. Additionally, the [[XTERRA Triathlon]] is a private off-road series and concluding with a championship each year in Maui.

The '''derbi barceloní''' ({{IPA-ca|ˈdɛɾβi βəɾsəluˈni}}; {{lang-es|Derbi barcelonés}}, {{IPA-es|ˈdeɾβi βaɾθeloˈnes|IPA}}; "Barcelonian Derby"), is the name given to [[Association football|football]] matches between [[FC Barcelona]] and [[RCD Espanyol]]. Both clubs are from [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]].&lt;ref name="Focus carries Barcelona to derby win at Espanyol"/&gt;

== Rivalry ==
In the first half of the 20th century during the [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]] dictatorship (1923-1930), FC Barcelona was seen as a club of the [[Catalan nationalism|catalanism nationalism ideology]] in stark contrast to RCD Espanyol which cultivated a kind of compliance to the central authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iss.europa.eu/index.php?id=18&amp;no_cache=1&amp;L=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Bpointer%5D=41&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=697&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=232&amp;tx_ttnews%5Bpage%5D=1&amp;cHash=2becc765c6|title=European football cultures and their integration: the 'short' Twentieth Century|date=March 2002|accessdate=1 July 2009|work=Europa (web portal)|last=Missiroli|first=Antonio}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In 1918 the municipalities of Catalonia promoted a campaign to request the Spanish Government a [[Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia|Statute of Autonomy]].
FC Barcelona joined that request and the Catalan press explained it by saying "FC Barcelona has become the club of Catalonia". The other team of the city, RCD Espanyol is dissociated from the claim.

In the present FC Barcelona is close to power in Catalonia. The last presidents have placed the club in a favorable position to [[Catalan independence|Catalan independence movement]] and the holding of a referendum even with discomfort in a little part of the fans in Catalonia and practically the totality of the fans in the rest of Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.esdiario.com/864128562/El-Barca-cae-en-su-trampa-con-el-tuit-de-la-verguenza-de-Bartomeu.html|title=El Barça cae en su trampa con el tuit de la vergüenza de Bartomeu|last=Temprano|first=Alejandra|date=2016-01-11|work=esdiario.es|access-date=2017-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some of the directors of the RCD Espanyol have manifested their independentist ideology the club stay out of politics and it is considered that most of the fans are against the independence of Catalonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marca.com/2015/09/10/futbol/equipos/espanyol/1441906568.html|title=Joan Collet: "Vamos a dar guerra al Madrid"|last=MARCA.com|date=2015-09-10|website=MARCA.com|language=es|access-date=2017-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On numerous occasions RCD Espanyol have complained of an unfavorable treatment which is sometimes directly offensive according to them, towards the club in favor of FC Barcelona by some public media dependent on the Generalidat of Catalonia like [[TV3 (Catalonia)|TV3]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.elmundo.es/deportes/2017/01/12/587777ec468aebd26a8b466d.html|title=El Espanyol "exige" la retirada de la campaña 'Si sientes el Barça, sientes Cataluña'|work=ELMUNDO|access-date=2017-06-17|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.elperiodico.com/es/noticias/deportes/espanyol-indignacion-texto-ensenayment-generalitat-4946067|title=Ensenyament retira un texto ofensivo con el Espanyol|last=BARCELONA|first=SERGI LÓPEZ-EGEA /|date=2016-03-03|work=El Periódico|access-date=2017-06-17|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economiadigital.es/politica-y-sociedad/el-espanyol-y-el-joventut-denuncian-pensamiento-unico-en-cataluna_188315_102.html|title=El Espanyol y el Joventut denuncian pensamiento único en Cataluña|work=Economiadigital (ed. general)|access-date=2017-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these differences in ideology, the ''derbi'' has always been more relevant to Espanyol supporters than Barcelona ones due to the difference in objectives.

== Background and history ==
Though it is the most played local derby in the history of La Liga, it is also the most unbalanced, with Barcelona overwhelmingly [[#Head to head|dominant]]. In the league table, Espanyol has only managed to finish above Barça on three occasions in almost 70 years and the only all-Catalan Copa del Rey final was won by Barça in [[1957 Copa del Generalísimo Final|1957]]. Espanyol has the consolation of achieving the largest margin win with a 6–0 in 1951. 

On 8 June 2007, Espanyol achieved a 2-2 draw against Barça in the penultimate day of the championship, making it possible for [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] to win the [[2006–07 La Liga]] in the next match at the Bernabeu. This match is popularly remembered with the name of ''Tamudazo,'' for [[Raúl Tamudo]], the Espanyol player who scored the goal for the draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2007666-remembering-the-tamudazo-when-espanyol-dashed-barcelonas-la-liga-title-dream|title=Remembering the Tamudazo When Espanyol Dashed Barcelona's La Liga Title Dream|last=Sharma|first=Rik|work=Bleacher Report|access-date=2017-06-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Espanyol achieved a 2–1 win against Barça during [[2008–09 La Liga|2008–09]], becoming the first team to defeat Barcelona at Camp Nou in their [[2008–09 FC Barcelona season|treble-winning season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/english/futbol/temporada_08-09/arxiu_partits/lliga/jornada24/Barcelona_Espanyol/partit.html|title=Matchday 24|publisher=FC Barcelona|accessdate=13 March 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120731081930/http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/english/futbol/temporada_08-09/arxiu_partits/lliga/jornada24/Barcelona_Espanyol/partit.html|archivedate=31 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Espanyol moved to their new [[RCDE Stadium]] in 2009, but it was not until their tenth meeting with Barcelona at their new arena that they were able to win a derby fixture (three draws, six defeats), winning 1–0 in the [[2017–18 Copa del Rey#Quarter-finals|2017–18 Copa del Rey quarter-final, first leg]] on 17 January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fcbarcelona.com/football/first-team/news/2017-2018/match-report-rcd-espanyol-1-0-fc-barcelona-derby-defeat|title=RCD Espanyol 1–0 FC Barcelona: Derby defeat |publisher=FC Barcelona|date=17 January 2018|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Barcelona oveturned this 2–0 at the [[Camp Nou]] the following week to go through in the tie,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fcbarcelona.com/football/first-team/news/2017-2018/match-report-fc-barcelona-v-espanyol-derby-delight-2-0-|title=FC Barcelona v Espanyol: Derby delight (2–0) |publisher=FC Barcelona|date=25 January 2018|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the tenth time in succession (since 1961) that ''Barça'' had progressed in the domestic cup.

As of 2018, ''Barça'''s [[Lionel Messi]] has scored 21 goals against Espanyol, the most in the history of the derby.&lt;ref name=messigoals/&gt;&lt;ref name="Focus carries Barcelona to derby win at Espanyol"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espnfc.com/blog/the-match/60/post/2414940/barcelona-stay-focus-to-claim-derby-win-at-espanyol |title=Focus carries Barcelona to derby win at Espanyol |website=ESPN FC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=FC Barcelona v RCD Espanyol: Messi delivers first-leg victory (4-1) |url=http://www.fcbarcelona.com/football/first-team/match-archive/2015-2016/copa-del-rey/1-8-1st-leg/fc-barcelona_rcd-espanyol |website=FC Barcelona |accessdate=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''derby''' ({{IPAc-en|uk|ˈ|d|ɑːr|b|i}} {{respell|DAR|bee}}, {{IPAc-en|us|ˈ|d|ɜːr|b|i}} {{respell|DUR|bee}}) is a type of [[Horse-racing|horse race]] named after the [[Derby Stakes]] run at [[Epsom Downs Racecourse]] in England.{{sfn|Reeves|1997|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=taIfkYgVCWIC&amp;lpg=PA134&amp;pg=PA134#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.134]}} That was in turn named after [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 12th Earl of Derby]], who inaugurated the race in 1780.{{sfn|Vesey|2003|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5YiIzxJT5o8C&amp;lpg=RA1-PT110&amp;pg=RA1-PT110#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 135]}} Perhaps the best-known example after the original is the [[Kentucky Derby]] in the [[United States]].{{sfn|Freeman|1997|loc=[https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=dujiiVP2KJIC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=eL9tTPubFY6CvgPVkdz1Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 68]}}{{sfn|Schreifer|Sivell|1996|[https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=NhXkvhEQaCQC&amp;lpg=SL11-PA1&amp;pg=SL11-PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.

Traditionally, the term "derby" is used strictly to refer to races restricted to three-year-olds,{{citation needed|date=August 2010}} as the [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing#United Kingdom|English]] and [[United States Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing|U.S.]] [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing|Triple Crown]] races all are. The most notable exceptions to this rule are the [[Hong Kong Derby]] and [[Singapore Derby]], restricted to four-year-old Thoroughbreds, and the Canadian Pacing Derby, an annual [[harness racing|harness race]] for "aged pacers" ([[Standardbred horse|Standardbreds]]) four years old and up.{{citation needed|date=August 2010}}

In [[Scandinavia]]n harness racing Derby is restricted to four-year-olds. Exception is [[finnhorse|the Finnhorse Derby]], which is restricted to five-year-olds.

Drag flicking is a scoring technique in the sport of [[field hockey]]. It was first seen in the late 1980s in Australia. [[Jay Stacy]] (former record holder for most caps for the Kookaburras) is credited as first using the skill in the 1987 Australian Hockey Championships in Hobart.  It is used as an attacking technique, mainly within [[penalty corner (field hockey)|penalty corner]] involving two main components known as the scoop and flick. However, as umpires become more and more strict within field hockey as new discoveries of techniques and training are subsequently making the sport more dangerous while also increasing the pace of the game. Therefore, it is evident that the drag flick is becoming more and more popular means of scoring even outside the penalty corner advantage. Although it is a somewhat dangerous piece of play for the opposition, it is within the rules and an effective technique for scoring. The drag flick involves a running up, and then forceful 'slinging' technique of the ball around your body, towards the goals. As drag flicking is not hitting the ball, the flicker is allowed to raise the ball at goals, hence making it a much more deadly alternative to hitting from the penalty corner as direct hitting shots on goal are not allowed to be above backboard height (460mm) during these set pieces.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fih.ch/files/Sport/Rules/FIH-Rules%20of%20Hockey%202012-interactif.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The action involves a player crouching low down next to the ball and picking it up on the shaft of the [[field hockey stick|hockey stick]]. The ball is then pushed along the ground whilst the stick is moving with a 'slinging' action. This serves to accelerate the ball, which is eventually released in a goalwards direction, often raised.

Drag flicks are especially common during penalty corners, and are used as a variant to the 'straight shot' or hit. The main difference between the drag flick and the hit is that the drag flick is classified in the rules of field hockey, as a push, which are allowed to be raised higher from a penalty corner first shot. This has created a controversy, as drag flicks, although being allowed to be lifted at goals (and consequently the defenders within the goal), are often nearly as powerful as a hit. This leads to danger and a high risk of injuries.

The differentiation to a simple flick is that for drag-flicking the player accelerates the ball from behind, leveraging the ball past his body and thus achieving a higher speed. Flicks are often used to quickly transfer the ball to an attacker when defence inhibits a flat pass. Besides, the technique of drag-flicking is not easy to perform when the ball is moving.

As drag flicks have become more popular, specialist hockey sticks have been designed to complement the slinging action of the shot. These sticks are notable for their 'bow' or curve. An example of this would be hockey equipment manufacturer [[Grays International]]'s Jumbow and Megabow range, which featured sticks from their GX series with greatly increased curvature. In 2005, the International Hockey Federation (FIH) limited the possible size of 'bows' allowed in international competitions which is now limited to 25&amp;nbsp;mm. The reason for this was that sticks with extravagant bows began to emerge. This led to dangerous levels of power being generated. (see [[Field Hockey#Equipment]]).

However, there have been recent calls for further changes to the FIH rulings. The FIH official rules states that a bow's maximum curvature from a rest position can be no more than 25&amp;nbsp;mm. To traverse this, many top stick manufacturers began to build sticks with one significantly heavier edge than the other, thus, when the stick was put at rest, it tilted to one side, reducing the measure curvature. Using this loophole, many stick manufacturers have produced sticks that have bows much greater than 25&amp;nbsp;mm, sometimes even exceeding 35&amp;nbsp;mm.

Along with changes in stick topography, as the drag flick became more prolific, it introduced the specialist drag flicker into a hockey team. In some cases, the drag flicker was not even part of the standard team but was substituted for a field player whenever a team was awarded a penalty corner. As soon as the penalty corner was over, the substitution was reversed. Because of this, it is now disallowed to substitute whenever a penalty corner situation is in effect, except for an injured goalkeeper, who may be substituted at any time. If a field player is injured during a penalty corner and has to leave the field for medical attention, a replacement player cannot enter the field until the penalty corner ends. [[Calum Giles]] (GB) was noted for being the best drag-flicker during this time, scoring 110 goals in 143 caps. Most national teams have a flicking expert within their sides, with some notable figures including [[Sohail Abbas]] of Pakistan, [[Sandeep Singh]], [[VR Ragunath]] and [[Rupinder Pal Singh]] of India, [[Taeke Taekema]] of the Netherlands, [[Troy Elder]] of Australia and [[Hayden Shaw]] of New Zealand.
Generally speed of drag flicks are in excess of 80&amp;nbsp;mph .

[[File:Zadinus - eventing training bij Tim Lips 25-06-2012.webm|thumb|eventing training]]

'''Eventing''' (also known as '''three day eventing''' or '''horse trials''') is an [[equestrianism|equestrian]] event where a single horse and rider combination compete against other combinations across the three disciplines of [[dressage]], [[cross-country equestrianism|cross-country]], and [[show jumping]].  This event has its roots in a comprehensive [[cavalry]] test which required mastery of several types of riding. The competition may be run as a '''one-day event''' ('''ODE'''), where all three events are completed in one day (dressage, followed by show jumping then the cross country phase) or a '''three-day event''' ('''3DE'''), which is more commonly now run over four days, with dressage on the first two days followed by cross country the next day and then show jumping in reverse order on the final day. Eventing was previously known as '''Combined Training''', and the name persists in many smaller organizations. The term "Combined Training" is sometimes confused with the term "Combined Test" which refers to a combination of just two of the phases, most commonly dressage and show jumping.

==Phases==
Eventing is an equestrian [[triathlon]], in that it combines three different disciplines in one competition set out over one, two, or three days, depending on the length of courses and number of entries. This sport follows a similar format in Australia, Canada, Ireland, United Kingdom and the United States

===Dressage===
[[File:Pitt Shoulder.JPG|right|200px|thumb|[[William Fox-Pitt]] performing a [[half-pass]] in a dressage test at an event.]]
{{See also|Dressage}}

The [[dressage]] phase (held first) consists of an exact sequence of movements ridden in an enclosed arena (20×60&amp;nbsp;m for International 3DE but usually 20×40&amp;nbsp;m for ODE). The test is judged by one or more judges who are looking for balance, rhythm, suppleness, and most importantly, the cooperation between the horse and rider. The challenge is to demonstrate that a supremely fit horse, capable of completing the cross country phase on time, also has the training to perform in a graceful, relaxed and precise manner. Dressage work is the basis of all the other phases and disciplines within the sport of eventing because it develops the strength and balance that allow a horse to go cross country and show jump competently.

At the highest level of competition, the dressage test is roughly equivalent to the United States Dressage Federation Third Level, and may ask for [[half-pass]] at trot, [[shoulder-in]], [[haunches-in|travers]], collected, medium and extended gaits, single [[flying change]]s and [[counter-canter]]. The tests may ''not'' ask for [[Grand Prix Dressage|Grand Prix]] movements such as [[piaffe]] or [[passage (dressage)|passage]].

Each movement in the test is scored on a scale from 0 to 10, with a score of "10" being the highest possible mark and with the total maximum score for the test varying depending on the level of competition and the number of movements. Therefore, if one movement is poorly executed, it is still possible for the rider to get a good overall score if the remaining movements are very well executed. The marks are added together and any errors of course deducted.  To convert this score to penalty points, the average marks of all judges are converted to a percentage of the maximum possible score, subtracted from 100 and the multiplied by a co-efficient decided by the governing body. Canadian example: 77 percent becomes 34.5 penalty points or (100 - 77) x 1.5 = 34.5
* Once the bell rings the rider is allowed 45 seconds to enter the ring or receive a two-point penalty, then an additional 45 seconds, for a total of 90 seconds, or is eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;https://files.usef.org/assets/j7nlXQg0tg4/13ev.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* If all four feet of the horse exit the arena during the test, this results in elimination.
* If the horse resists more than 20 seconds during the test, this results in elimination.
* Errors on course:
** 1st: minus 2 marks
** 2nd: minus 4 marks
** 3rd: elimination

===Cross-country===
[[Image:454 Paul Sims on Sunny Boy.jpg|left|thumb|A rider on cross-country]]
The next phase, [[cross-country equestrianism|cross-country]], requires both horse and rider to be in excellent physical shape and to be brave and trusting of each other. This phase consists of approximately 12–20 fences (lower levels), or 30–40 at the higher levels, placed on a long outdoor circuit. These fences consist of very solidly built natural objects (logs, stone walls, etc.) as well as various obstacles such as [[water (obstacle)|ponds and streams]], ditches, [[bank (obstacle)|drops and banks]], and [[Combination (jump)|combinations]] including several jumping efforts based on objects that would commonly occur in the countryside. Sometimes, particularly at higher levels, fences are designed that would not normally occur in nature. However, these are still designed to be as solid as more natural obstacles. Safety regulations mean that some obstacles are now being built with a "frangible pin system", allowing part or all of the jump to collapse if hit with enough impact. Speed is also a factor, with the rider required to cross the finish line within a certain time frame (optimum time). Crossing the finish line after the optimum time results in penalties for each second over.  At lower levels, there is also a speed fault time, where penalties are incurred for horse and rider pairs completing the course too quickly. For every "disobedience" (refusal or run-out of a jump) a horse and rider incur on course, penalties will be added to their dressage score. After four disobediences altogether or three disobediences at one fence the pair is eliminated, meaning they can no longer participate in the competition. A horse and rider pair can also be eliminated for going off course, for example missing a fence. If the horses shoulder and hind-quarter touch the ground, mandatory retirement is taken and they are not allowed to participate further in the competition. If the rider falls off the horse they are eliminated. However, in the US this rule is currently being revised for the Novice level and below. The penalties for disobediences on cross country are weighted severely relative to the other phases of competition to emphasize the importance of courage, endurance and athleticism. Fitness is required as the time allowed will require a strong canter at the lower levels, all the way to a strong gallop at the higher events.

In recent years, a controversy has developed between supporters of short and long format three-day events.  Traditionally, three-day events had dressage, endurance, and show jumping.  Endurance day consisted of 4 phases: A, B, C and D.  Phases A and C were roads and tracks, with A being a medium-paced warm up to prepare the horse and rider for Phase B, a steeplechase format at an extremely fast pace over steeplechase-style fences.  Phase C was a slow-paced cool down coming off of phase B, in preparation for the toughest and most demanding phase, D, or cross-country.  Before embarking on phase D, in the "ten-minute box", horses had to be approved to continue by a [[veterinary physician|vet]], who monitored their temperature and [[circulatory system of the horse|heart rate]], ensuring that the horse was sound and fit.

Three day events are now offered in the classic format, with endurance day, or short-format, with no steeplechase (phase B) or roads and tracks (phases A and C).  The 2004 Olympic Summer Games in Athens, Greece chose the short format, due to lack of facilities, time and financing, which sparked a large debate in the eventing community whether to keep the steeplechase phase or just offer cross-country. Today, most events are run short-format. In the United States the "classic format" remains a popular option for the Novice, and Training levels of competition at select events.

In 2008, the rules regarding safety in the sport were changed. One change stated that a fall anywhere during the cross-country phase resulted in elimination, even if the rider was galloping on course and not approaching a jump, or in the middle of a combination.

==== Types of obstacles ====
{{Main article|Cross-country equestrianism|Indoor cross-country|Horse jumping obstacles}}

[[Image:3DE combinaison direct way.svg|right|thumb|200px|The "direct route" when jumping cross-country]]
[[Image:3DE combinaison optional way.svg|right|thumb|200px|If the rider has a refusal at the direct route, he may jump the other B element without additional penalty than incurred for the refusal.]] 
A combination is always considered one obstacle, and the various elements within the combination are lettered "A", "B", "C", and so on. In cross-country, the rider need only retake the element they refused rather than the whole complex. So a refusal at element B does not require them to jump A again. However, they have the option of retaking the previous elements if they wish. For example, in a bounce type obstacle it may be physically impossible to approach B without first clearing A. Yet for some in and outs, you can go to B and not have to rejump A.

Many cross-country obstacles have several possible routes to take (for example, at obstacle 5 there may be 2 A, 2 B, and 2 C elements), with one route usually being faster but requiring a more skillful ride or more physical effort from the horse. A rider may take any of the possible routes as long as they pass over each letter once. Additionally, after a refusal, they may jump a different obstacle of the same letter in place of the original.

A refusal at A is a first refusal, and would receive 20 penalties. Whether the rider retakes A or not, a subsequent refusal at B is a second refusal and so on. Three refusals at any one obstacle results in elimination, as does 4 refusals on the entire course.

===Veterinary inspection, or "trot up"/"horse inspection"===
Before the beginning of a three-day event, and also before the last phase, horses are inspected by a vet to ensure that they are fit to compete further. It is usually a formal affair, with well-groomed and braided horses, and nicely dressed riders. It is also a very nerve-wracking time, as the "pass" or "fail" determines whether the horse may continue with the competition. A vet can request that a horse be sent to the holding box, where it will then be re-assessed before being allowed to continue.  In upper level FEI classes, a second veterinarian (often called the Associate FEI Veterinarian) may inspect horses sent to the hold box and make the decision to pass or fail a horse.  This practice is in place so that no one veterinarian has complete power to eliminate a horse and allows for a large number of horses to be evaluated in a timely manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fei.org/sites/default/files/FINALVeterinary%20Regulations%20proposed%20changes%20for%202012_6_.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130429093745/http://www.fei.org/sites/default/files/FINALVeterinary%20Regulations%20proposed%20changes%20for%202012_6_.pdf |archivedate=2013-04-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In lower levels of competition, the horse's movement may be analyzed as they finish the cross-country, where they will be asked to trot briefly after crossing the finishing line to satisfy the vet of their soundness.

===Ten Minute Box===

The "Ten Minute Box" is a compulsory halt included during the cross country section of a three-day event after the roads and tracks and steeplechase phases and before the "pure" cross-country jumping phase. It is a pause designed to allow the horse (and rider!) time to cool off, rest and stabilize its vitals and ensure that it is prepared for the "pure" cross-country phase. In the Ten Minute Box, riders and assistants will cool the horse down, walk the horse around and check tack and studs and a veterinarian will inspect the horse - including checking its heart and respiration rates - to determine if it is fit to compete in the final "pure" cross-country phase.

===Stadium jumping===
[[Image:RolexFence1.JPG|thumb|Show jumping phase at the Land Rover Kentucky Three Day Event]]
{{Main article|Show jumping}}

Stadium or show jumping is the final phase of eventing competition and tests the technical jumping skills of the horse and rider, including suppleness, obedience, fitness and athleticism. In this phase, 12–20 fences are set up in a ring. These fences are typically brightly colored and consist of elements that can be knocked down, unlike cross country obstacles. This phase is also timed, with penalties being given for every second over the required time. In addition to normal jumping skills, eventing show jumping tests the fitness and stamina of the horse and rider, generally being held after the cross-country phase in higher level and international events.

==== Scoring ====
* Knocking down an obstacle: 4 penalties
* Disobedience (refusal, run-out, circle, moving backwards) over the whole round:
** First: 4 penalties
** Second:  Elimination
* Fall of rider: Elimination
* Fall of horse: Elimination
* Exceeding the time allowed: 1 penalty per second
* Jumping an obstacle in the wrong order: Elimination
* Error of course not rectified: Elimination

An obstacle is defined as having been knocked down if any part of its height is lowered. It is therefore possible to knock out a pole below the top pole and receive no penalties, as long as the highest pole stays in place, so that the jump retains the same height. It does count as a knockdown if the highest pole falls out of one jump cup but remains in the other; although part of the pole remains at the original height, the other part is lowered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Rules of Each Event Phase and How They Are Scored|url=http://www.britisheventing.com/section.asp?section=681&amp;sectionTitle=The+Phases+explained|publisher=British Eventing|accessdate=15 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jumping Rules|url=http://www.fei.org/sites/default/files/file/OFFICIALS%20%26%20ORGANISERS/ORGANISERS/JUMPING/Technical%20Info/JumpRules_24thEd_2013_clean_1.pdf|publisher=Fédération Equestre Internationale|accessdate=15 December 2012}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The winner is the horse and rider with the fewest penalties. Awards are usually presented while mounted, before the placed riders take a lap of honor around the arena.

===Olympic beginning===
{{See also|Equestrian at the Summer Olympics}}
Eventing competition that resembles the current three-day were first held in 1902, at the [[Championnat du Cheval d'Armes]] in [[France]], and was introduced into the [[Equestrian at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] starting [[Equestrian at the 1912 Summer Olympics|1912]] in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]. [[Dressage]] originally demonstrated the horse's ability to perform on the parade ground, where elegance and obedience were key. [[Cross-country equestrianism|Cross-country]] began as a test of stamina, courage, and bravery over difficult terrain, important for a [[wikt:charger#Noun|charger]] on long marches or if the horse was asked to carry a dispatch across country. The [[show jumping|stadium jumping]] phase sought to prove the horse's continuing soundness and fitness after the difficult cross-country day.

The Olympic eventing competition was originally open only to male military officers in active duty, mounted only on military charges. In 1924, the event was open to male civilians, although [[Non-commissioned officer|non-commissioned Army officers]] could not participate in the Olympics until 1956. Women were first allowed to take part in 1964; equestrian sports are one of the few Olympic sports in which men and women compete against one another.

===Format===
The original format, used in the [[Equestrian at the 1912 Summer Olympics – Individual eventing|1912 Olympics]], was spread over several days:
*'''Day 1''': Endurance test comprising {{convert|55|km|mi|abbr=on}} (with a time allowed of 4 hours, giving a speed of approx. 230 meters per minute) immediately followed by 5&amp;nbsp;km of a flagged cross-country course at a speed of 333 meters per minute. Time penalties were given for exceeding the time allowed, but no bonus points were given for being fast.
*'''Day 2''': Rest day
*'''Day 3''': [[steeplechase (horse racing)|Steeplechase]] test of 3.5&amp;nbsp;km with 10 plain obstacles, at a speed of 600 mpm, with time penalties but no time bonus points
*'''Day 4''': Jumping test ("prize jumping"), which was considered easy by most of the spectators
*'''Day 5''': Dressage test ("prize riding")

The [[1924 Summer Olympics|Paris Games]] in 1924 introduced a format very similar to the one of today: with day 1 dressage, day 2 the endurance test, and day 3 the jumping test. The endurance test has changed the most since that time. Originally, bonus points could be earned for a fast ride cross-country (less than the optimum time). This helped competitors make up for a poor dressage ride, with a clean, fast cross-country ride. This system, however, was dropped in 1971. The format for the endurance test occurred as below:

*'''Phase A''': Short roads and tracks (with five penalties per 5 seconds over time)
*'''Phase B''': Steeplechase, decreased in speed from 600 mpm to 550 mpm (with 10 penalties added per 5 seconds over the time, 3 bonus points per 5 seconds under time)
*'''Phase C''': Long roads and tracks (with 5 penalties per 5 seconds over time)
*'''Compulsory Halt''' (now the 10-minute halt)
*'''Phase D''': Cross-country (with 10 penalties added per 5 seconds over the time, 3 bonus points per 10 seconds under time)
*'''Phase E''': 1.25 mile run on the flat (with 5 penalties per 5 seconds over time).

(Note: Phase E was abolished in 1967.)

In 1963, the 10-minute halt was introduced, to occur after the completion of phases A, B, and C. It took place in a marked out area (the 10-minute box), where the horse was checked by two judges and one veterinary official who would make sure the horse was fit to continue onto phase D. If the horse was unfit, the panel would pull it from the competition.

The format of the sport underwent major changes in 2004 and 2005, with the creation of the "short" or "modified format", which excluded phases A, B, and C from endurance day. The primary reason for excluding these phases was that the Olympic Committee was considering dropping the sport of eventing from the Olympics because of the cost and large area required for the speed and endurance phase with a steeplechase course and several miles of roads-and-tracks. To prevent the elimination of the sport from the Olympics program, the "short format" was developed by the FEI. The last Olympic Games that included the long, or "classic", three-day format was the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney, while [[Rolex Kentucky Three Day|Rolex Kentucky]], the [[Badminton Horse Trials]], and [[Burghley Horse Trials]] ran their last long format three-day in 2005. The short format is now the standard for international competition, such as the Olympics and [[World Equestrian Games]].

The change in format has brought about controversy. Some riders support the continuation of the classic format, believing it is the "true test of horse and rider". Others believe the classic format is superior because it teaches horsemanship, due to the extra preparation needed to condition the horse and the care required after the several miles of endurance day. However, others prefer the short format, as they believe it saves wear-and-tear on their horses and allows the horse not only to compete in more three-day events each season, but decreases the chance of injury to the horse. However, this claim has not held true in several recent studies that compared injuries sustained in classic and in short format competitions over equivalent courses.  Further, some research indicates that horses are more stressed by the short format than by the careful warm-up inherent in the classic format.  Regardless, many upper-level riders prepare their horses for the short format using the same conditioning and training as for the long format. The short format has also been widely urged by breeders of heavier, warmblood-type horses. The long format has remained popular at the Novice and Training levels in the United States, and with riders who feel it maximizes horsemanship.

===Penalty point system===
In 1971, the penalty point system was first introduced into eventing. This system converts the dressage score and all jump penalties on cross-country and show jumping into penalty points, with the horse and rider with the fewest number of points winning the event. Different weight is given for each phase, with the cross-country — the heart of eventing — being the most important, followed by the dressage, and then the show jumping. The intended ratio of cross-country:dressage:show jumping is theoretically 12:3:1. Therefore, an error in cross-country counts heavily. This prevents horses that are simply good in dressage (for example) from winning the event with a poor cross-country test.

In 1971, the following penalty system was instituted:
*'''Phase A and C''': 1 penalty per second over the optimum time
*'''Phase B''': 0.8 penalties per second over
*'''Phase D''': 0.4 penalties per second over

In 1977, the dressage scoring was changed, with each movement marked out of ten rather than out of six. This increased the maximum number of dressage marks from 144 to 240. This number later increased to 250 marks in 1998, after additional movements were added. To keep the correct weight, a formula is used to convert good marks in dressage to penalty points. First, the marks of the judges (if there is more than one) are averaged. Then the raw mark is subtracted from the maximum points possible. This number is then multiplied by 0.6 to calculate the final penalty score.

Show jumping rules were also changed in 1977, with a knock-down or a foot in the water awarded only 5 penalties rather than 10. This prevented the show jumping phase from carrying too much weight, again, to keep the ratio between the phases correct.

=== Changes to eventing starting in 2017 ===
As of January 2017 eventing will undergo some changes. The [[International Federation for Equestrian Sports|FEI]] (Federation Equestre International) has introduced some changes that will effect the penalty point system in the cross country phase of the competition. Changes such as an introduction of a 50 penalty&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=HorseandHound.Co.uk|accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; mark being awarded if the horse and rider jump outside a flag. Previously resulting in elimination this error will incur faults only if it is unrectified. If the rider returns to clear the jump 20 penalties will be awarded. Up until now a rider could ask the fence judge if their horse jumped inside the flags, this will now be deemed as outside assistance and will result in elimination.

===Non-Olympic competition===
In its early days, the sport was most popular in Britain, and the British gave the competition a new name, the "Three-Day Event", due to the three-day time span of the competition. In America, the sport was also called "combined training", due to the three different disciplines and types of training methods needed for the horse.  In the [[United Kingdom]], "combined training" competition includes only the dressage and show jumping phases.

In between a 'combined training' and a 'horse trial', there are also 'short courses'. Short courses consist of a dressage phase and a jumping phase. The jumping phase usually starts in the stadium ring with a fence leading out to a smaller field with some cross country fences (not as many as in a horse trial's cross country phase). The rider will then jump back into the stadium ring to finish his or her course.

The first annual, Olympic-level event developed was the [[Badminton Horse Trials]], held each year in England. First held in 1949, the Badminton event was created after a poor performance by the British Eventing Team at the 1948 Olympic Games, with the purpose of being a high-class preparation event, and as extra exposure for the military horses, who very rarely had the chance to compete. Initially, only British riders were allowed to compete (although women were allowed, despite being banned from riding in the Olympics), but the competition is now an international open to all riders from around the world who have qualified for this level of competition.  Badminton is the most prestigious events to win in the world.  Currently, the Olympic event is consider a CCI***, a rank lower than Badminton which is a CCI****.

The second three-day competition to be held at Olympic level each year was the [[Burghley Horse Trials]], first held in 1961. Burghley is the longest running international event.

The first CCI held outside of Britain on an annual basis is the [[Rolex Kentucky Three Day]], held each year in Lexington since 1978.

===Importance of dressage training===
In the early years, the dressage phase was fairly inconsequential in determining the final standings. It was quite possible for a horse to have a terrible dressage test, then run a clean cross-country and show jumping, and still finish near the top of the standings. Since then, correct dressage training has become increasingly important should a horse and rider wish to be placed (complete all sections, and finish in the top 12).  This can be traced back to [[Sheila Willcox]] who took a particular interest in dressage, becoming abundantly clear when she won Badminton three years running in the 1950s.  She had a strong influence on [[Mary King (equestrian)|Mary King]] and [[Lucinda Green]] amongst others.

After the 2000 Olympic Games, the [[International Federation for Equestrian Sports|FEI]] hired British eventer and dressage rider [[Christopher Bartle]] to write new dressage tests for the upper level events, which would include a greater deal of collection.  This has since raised the standard even further in the dressage phase.

Additionally, the cross-country phase has become more technical, asking the horse to be adjustable and supple through [[Combination (jump)|combinations]].  A horse can no longer just be brave and athletic, but must have a good deal of dressage training should his rider wish to successfully negotiate odd distances or bending lines at a gallop.  Also, in show jumping, a horse is asked to move with impulsion and engagement; this makes the jump more fluent, brings the horse to bascule more correctly, and is less jarring for both horse and rider.

===Safety===
Between 1997 and December 2008, at least 37 eventing riders died as a result of injuries incurred while competing in the cross-country phase of eventing at national or international level or at Pony Club. Of these, 18 riders died in the period 2006–2008. These 37 fatal falls have been at all levels of the sport, from domestic one-day events up to regional championships level, and they have occurred in most of the recognized eventing countries around the world, with concentrations in the United Kingdom (14) and the United States (8). At least 25 of these 37 deaths have resulted from a somersaulting (rotational) fall of the horse, with 11 of the 16 deaths in 2007 and 2008 being reported as having resulted from a rotational horse fall.&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name=Horsetalk081219&gt;Horsetalk – [http://www.horsetalk.co.nz/saferide/131-eventingincrisis.shtml Eventing in crisis?] 19 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Information about horse fatalities is difficult to locate, but at least 19 eventing horses, many of them top-level performers, died in 2007 and 2008, most of them in the US.&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name=Horsetalk081219 /&gt;

Over time, course design has become increasingly more focused on the safety of the horse and rider. Fences are built more solidly than in the earlier days, encouraging a bold jump from the horse, which actually helps prevent falls. The layout of the course and the build of the obstacles encourage the horse to have a successful run. This includes a greater use of precision fences, such as [[corner (fence)|corner]]s and "skinny jumps", that are very good tests of the rider's ability and the horse's training, but allow the horse to simply run around the jump if the rider misjudges it. Safety measures such as filling in the area between corner-shaped jumps on cross-country or rails of a fence help prevent the entrapment of the legs of the horse decrease the number of serious falls or injuries.

The newest improvement in cross-country safety is the ''frangible'' fence, which uses a pin and other techniques which allow the fence to "break or fall" in a controlled manner to minimize the risk of injury to horse and rider. This can help to prevent the most dangerous situation on cross-country, when the horse hits a solid fence between the forearm and chest, and somersaults over, sometimes falling on the rider. This type of fall has caused the deaths of several riders and horses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eventingsafety.wordpress.com/|title=Eventing Safety and Risk Management|author=|date=|website=Eventing Safety and Risk Management|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leg protection for horses has also improved. Very little was used in the early days, even on cross-country. Leg protection is now seen on nearly every horse at all levels. Boots have increased technologically, and include materials that either help absorb shock or are very hard and strong to prevent a serious injury.

Rules protecting riders have improved as well. Riders are now required to wear a safety vest (body protector) during cross-country, as well as an [[ASTM]]/[[Safety Equipment Institute|SEI]] or [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] approved [[equestrian helmet]] equipped with a retention harness,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.equisearch.com/horses_riding_training/tack_apparel/english/safety100703/ Barakat, Christine.

Eventing was one of the first sports to require the use of a helmet with harness when jumping. As of 2010, more riders were wearing [[air bag vest]]s, which automatically inflate if a rider falls off the horse.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Katie. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/24/sports/24airbag.html "Added Safety in the Saddle"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 23, 2010. Accessed August 25, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weight rule===
From the beginning, event horses had to carry a minimum weight of {{convert|165|lb|abbr=on}} (including rider and saddle) during the endurance test, since military horses were expected to be able to carry such weight. Lead weights were carried on the saddle, and the competitor had to be weighed-in with tack immediately following cross-country. The weight was reduced to {{convert|154|lb|abbr=on}} for the 1996 Olympic Games, after a study demonstrated that both the horse's arc over a fence became shallower and the leading leg took a great deal of extra force on landing when the horse was carrying dead weight than when free from the burden. The rule was eventually abolished January 1, 1998. By removing this rule, the stress on the joints and soft-tissue, as well as the chance of a fall, were decreased.&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, Jennifer O. ''Olympic Equestrian, A Century of International Horse Sport''. Lexington, KY: Blood-Horse Publications, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==International competition==
[[Image:Burghley 2004.jpg|thumb|right|Burghley is one of the most prestigious international events.]]
International events have specific categories and levels of competition and are conducted under the rules of the [[International Federation for Equestrian Sports|FEI]]. [[Concours Complet International|CCI]] (Concours Complet International, or International Complete Contest) is one such category and defines a three-day event that is open to competitors from any foreign nation as well as the host nation.

*[[Concours Complet International|CCI]] : International Three-day event (Concours Complet International)
*CIC: International One-day event (Concours International Combiné)
*CCIO: International Team Competitions (Concours Complet International Officiel). Includes the Olympics, the [[Eventing World Championship|World Championships]], the Pan Am Games, and other continental championships

The levels of international events are identified by the number of stars next to the category; there are four levels in total. A CCI* is for horses that are just being introduced to international competition. A CCI** is geared for horses that have some experience of international competition. CCI*** is the advanced level of competition.

The very highest level of competition is the CCI****, and with only six such competitions in the world ([[Badminton Horse Trials|Badminton]], [[Burghley Horse Trials|Burghley]], [[Kentucky_Three-Day_Event| Kentucky]], [[Australian International Three Day Event|Adelaide]], [[Luhmuhlen Horse Trials]], and the [[Étoiles de Pau|Stars of Pau]]) it is the ultimate aim of many riders. The [[Eventing World Championship|World Championships]] are also considered CCI****. Rolex offer a financial prize for any rider who can win three of the biggest competitions in succession. These are Badminton, Burghley and Kentucky. So far, Pippa Funnell (Great Britain) and Michael Jung (Germany) are the only riders to do this. Andrew Hoy did come close, however, and in 2010 Oliver Townend was competing for this coveted "Grand Slam" at Rolex Kentucky when he suffered a fall at obstacle #20 which eliminated him from competition.

One, two and three-star competitions are roughly comparable to the Novice, Intermediate and Advanced levels of British domestic competition, respectively, and to the Preliminary, Intermediate, and Advanced levels of American domestic competition, respectively.

==National competition==
Eventing rules and the recognized levels in various nations are similar, but not always identical.  While rules usually follow the FEI to some degree, history and tradition of various nations has also influenced competition rules within a given country.

In addition to recognized events that prepare the best riders for international competition, many nations also offer eventing for beginner, youth, and amateur riders through organizations such as [[Pony Club]], [[4-H]] or other riding clubs, where most riders begin their competitive careers.  At the most elementary levels, fence heights begin at around 18&amp;nbsp;inches to {{convert|2|ft|m|abbr=on}}.

===Australia===
In Australia, where [[Equestrian Australia]] governs eventing competition, the levels are as follows:
* Encouragers: XC:  fences maximum height 0.45m 375 m/min; Stadium fences: 0.45m
* Newcomers: XC:  fences maximum height 0.60m 350 m/min; Stadium fences: 0.60m
* Introductory: XC: fences maximum height 0.80 m ditch 1.40 m drops 1.0 m 400 m/min; Stadium fences: 0.8 m
* Preliminary: XC: fences maximum height 0.95 m ditch 2.00 m drops 1.2 m 450 m/min; Stadium fences: 0.95 m
* Pre Novice: XC: fences maximum height 1.05 m ditch 2.40 m drops 1.4, 500 m/min; Stadium fences: 1.05 m
* 1 Star: XC: fences maximum height 1.10 m ditch 2.80 m drops 1.6 m 520 m/min; Stadium fences: 1.15 m
* 2 Star: XC: fences maximum height 1.15 m ditch 3.20 m drops 1.8 m 550 m/min; Stadium fences: 1.20 m
* 3 Star: XC: fences maximum height 1.20 m ditch 3.60 m drops 2.0 m 570 m/min; Stadium fences: 1.25 m

===United States===
In the United States, eventing is broken down into the following levels, all of which are recognized by the United States Eventing Association ([[USEA]]) and are run in accordance to their rules:

* Beginner Novice: X-C fences: {{convert|2|ft|7|in|m|abbr=on}}, 14–18 efforts XC, ditch {{convert|4|ft|m|abbr=on}}, drops {{convert|3|ft|3|in|m|abbr=on}}, 300–350 m/min (meters per minute) on cross country; Stadium fences: {{convert|2|ft|7|in|m|abbr=on}}, 9–11 efforts.
* Novice: X-C fences {{convert|2|ft|11|in|m|abbr=on}}, 16–20 efforts, ditch {{convert|6|ft|7|in|m|abbr=on}}, drops {{convert|3|ft|11|in|m|abbr=on}}, 350 to 400 m/min; Stadium fences {{convert|2|ft|11|in|m|abbr=on}}, 9–11 efforts.
* Training: X-C fences {{convert|3|ft|3|in|m|abbr=on}}, 20–24 efforts, ditch {{convert|7|ft|11|in|m|abbr=on}}, drops {{convert|4|ft|7|in|m|abbr=on}}, 420 to 470 m/min; Stadium fences {{convert|3|ft|3|in|m|abbr=on}}, 10–12 efforts.
* Modified: X-C fences 3 ft 5 in (1.04 m), 22-28 efforts, ditch 8 ft 6 in (2.59 m), drops 4 ft 11 in (1.50 m), 490 m/min; Stadium fences 3 ft 5 in (1.04 m), 10-13 efforts.
* Preliminary: X-C fences {{convert|3|ft|7|in|abbr=on|m}}, 22–30 efforts, ditch {{convert|9|ft|2|in|abbr=on|m}}, drops {{convert|5|ft|3|in|abbr=on|m}}, 520 m/min; Stadium fences {{convert|3|ft|7|in|abbr=on|m}}, 11–13 efforts.
* Intermediate: X-C fences {{convert|3|ft|9|in|m|abbr=on}}, 26–34 efforts, ditch {{convert|10|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}}, drops {{convert|5|ft|11|in|m|abbr=on}}, 550 m/min; Stadium fences {{convert|3|ft|11|in|m|abbr=on}}, 12–14 efforts.
* Advanced: X-C fences {{convert|3|ft|11|in|m|abbr=on}}, 32–40 efforts, ditch {{convert|11|ft|10|in|m|abbr=on}}, drops {{convert|6|ft|7|in|m|abbr=on}}, 570 m/min; Stadium fences {{convert|4|ft|1|in|m|abbr=on}}, 13–15 efforts.

It is also common to see inter-levels (such as the Intermediate/Preliminary, or IP), which help riders transition between levels by using the dressage and show jumping tests of the higher level and the cross country course of the lower; and starter levels, which use the dressage test and stadium course standards of the lower CT levels (e.g. Amoeba, Tadpole, Green as Grass) with a very simple cross country course. However, the starter levels are considered "Test" levels and thus do not have a consistent standard (or a national points system and leaderboard).

==Horse==
In the lower levels, it is possible for any [[list of horse breeds|breed of horse]], if it has the talent for it, to do well in eventing.  [[Thoroughbred]]s and part-Thoroughbreds currently dominate the sport at the top levels because of their stamina and athletic ability, although many [[warmblood]]s and warmblood-thoroughbred crosses also do well. In the UK, [[Irish Horse|Irish sport horses]] have been popular for many years.

Because larger horses are favored, animals with some [[draft horse]] breeding are also seen, notably the [[Irish Draught]] and [[Clydesdale horse|Clydesdale]] crossbreds.  However, smaller horses can also excel; for example, the third place competitor in the 2007 [[Rolex Kentucky Three Day]] CCI competition was [[Theodore O'Connor]], a {{hands|14.1}} gelding that was a cross of Thoroughbred, [[Arabian horse|Arabian]] and [[Shetland pony]] breeding.&lt;ref&gt;"Karen O'Connor and 'The Pony' Theodore O'Connor Wow The Crowd, Finishing Third"  Accessed June 21, 2007 at http://www.horsesdaily.com/news/eventing/2007/07rolex/04-29-oconnor.html&lt;/ref&gt;

An event horse must be very responsive to succeed, as a horse that will not listen to a rider on the cross-country phase may end up taking a fall at a jump. The horse should be calm and submissive for the dressage phase, with good training on the flat. For cross-country, the horse must be brave, athletic, and (especially at the higher levels) fast with a good galloping stride and great stamina. The horse does not have to possess perfect jumping form, but should be safe over fences and have good scope. The best event horses are careful over jumps, as those who are not tend to have stadium rails knocked down on the last day. The horse also needs to have sound [[horse conformation|conformation]] and good [[horse hoof|feet]].

==Riding attire==
Riding attire is different in each of the three phases.  Dressage and stadium jumping feature the traditional turnout for each of those disciplines, requiring conservative attire.  However, as of 2017 lower level divisions in the United States allow for more flexibility in the rider's attire. Cross-country attire and equipment emphasizes and requires safety protocols be followed, but has less formal appearance, with many riders wearing clothing of personalized, often bright colors.  Under FEI rules, civilian riders may opt to wear the uniform of their riding club, and members of the military and national studs are required to wear service dress in the dressage and stadium jumping phases.&lt;ref name="FEI 2013 Eventing Rules"&gt;{{cite book|title=FEI Eventing Rules 24th Edition|year=2013|publisher=International Equestrian Federation|location=Lausanne, Switzerland|page=54|url=http://fei.org/sites/default/files/2013_Eventing_Rules_Final_March_changes_integrated.pdf|access-date=2013-09-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004215507/http://fei.org/sites/default/files/2013_Eventing_Rules_Final_March_changes_integrated.pdf|archive-date=2013-10-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dressage===
For the intermediate and advanced levels, riders usually wear dressage attire similar to that of [[Grand Prix Dressage]], including a [[top hat]] and white [[riding breeches]].  However, even at the most senior levels (e.g., the World Equestrian Games, the Olympics, and CCI****) the actual FEI dress requirements are less strict, requiring only "hunting dress"; a white shirt and a tie of any kind; gloves of any colour; white, fawn, or cream breeches; and [[riding boots]] of any colour.&lt;ref name="FEI 2013 Eventing Rules" /&gt; The wearing of [[shadbelly]] or other tailcoat jackets is not compulsory in the dressage phase.&lt;ref name="FEI 2013 Eventing Rules" /&gt;

Rules at non-FEI competition vary.  In the  USA, formal attire is not required if all phases run in one day or for the lower levels.&lt;ref name="2013 USEF Eventing Rules"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.usef.org/forms-pubs/KlV5P9prkmM/ev-eventing-division|title=USEF Rules for Eventing|last=|first=|publisher=United States Equestrian Federation|year=2013|isbn=|location=Lexington, KY, United States|page=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though navy and black coats are the preferred traditional style, riders may wear any conservatively colored dark  or tweed hunting coat with a white shirt and choker or, preferably, a stock tie with pin.  If a rider wishes to stay within traditional requirements for higher-level competition, breeches should be white, fawn, or cream.  A black or navy hunt cap or [[derby]] hat may be worn, although many riders use an [[equestrian helmet]], which are considered safer.&lt;ref name="2013 USEF Eventing Rules"/&gt;  Helmets are compulsory at lower levels.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Boots may be field or dress style, black or brown in color.&lt;ref name="2013 USEF Eventing Rules"/&gt;  Gloves and spurs give a polished appearance but are not required at lower levels.  Dressage gloves are traditionally white, although other colors are permitted. [[Spur]]s, when worn, are restricted to certain lengths and types. [[Riding boots]] such as field or dress tall boots are usually black.

===Cross-country===
[[Image:R3DE XCountry.JPG|right|thumb|Attire in the cross-country phase is the least formal, and many riders choose "eventing colours", to which they match some of their horse's tack.]] The rider is required to wear a protective vest, as well as an ASTM/SEI/BS approved [[equestrian helmet]], properly fastened at all times when jumping.  A medical armband, containing the rider's medical history, is required, allowing access to the information should the rider fall, be knocked unconscious, and require medical treatment.

Apart from these three compulsory safety items, FEI rules allow riders to dress as they please in the cross-country phase.&lt;ref name="FEI 2013 Eventing Rules" /&gt;  Riders wear anything from traditional hunter green or navy blue, to tie-dye, zebra stripes, or fluorescent colours. Breeches may be any color, with some riders coordinating it with their shirt or vest color.  Light-weight rugby or polo shirts are the most commonly worn shirt style, usually without a stock or tie.  Riding coats are generally not worn.

Lastly, many riders also wear a stop-watch to track their time as they go cross-country so that they may adjust their speed as needed to come in as close as possible to the optimum time, if not faster.

===Stadium jumping===
Eventing riders tend to follow the dress practices of showjumpers in the stadium jumping phase.  However,  FEI rules only require "hunting dress"; white shirt and tie of any kind; white, fawn, or cream breeches; and boots of any kind.&lt;ref name="FEI 2013 Eventing Rules" /&gt;
 
In most nations' nationally sanctioned competitions, and often even at lower levels, a protective [[equestrian helmet]] with harness is required, and a short hunt coat is traditional, except when weather is unreasonably warm, when, at the discretion of the technical delegate, jackets may be considered optional.  If helmet covers are used, they are required to be black or dark blue though some now include national colors where they are entitled to be worn.

==Turnout of the horse and tack==

===Turnout and grooming===
Event horses are turned out similarly to dressage horses, with the legs and face (muzzle, jaw, sides of ears, [[bridle path (horse)|bridle path]]) neatly clipped. The tail is usually "banged" (cut straight across), usually to a length between the fetlock joint and lower hock. Additionally, most event riders clip the sides of their mount's tails, to give them a finer appearance. The braiding of tails is fairly uncommon, probably because the tail can not be braided if the hairs along the sides of the dock are clipped.

The [[mane (horse)|mane]] is pulled to about 3 inches in length and is usually braided for dressage as well as the show jumping phase. However, most riders prefer to leave it loose for cross-country in case they need to grab it for security. Some riders also place [[quarter marks]] (decorative stenciling) on the hindquarters.

===Tack===
[[Image:Rolex XCountry.JPG|right|thumb|A horse on cross-country, showing the "eventer's grease" on his legs to help him slide over obstacles.]]
Most event riders have a jumping saddle as well as a dressage saddle, since each places them in a position better-suited for its purpose. At the lower levels, however, a rider can ride all three phases without difficulty in a well-fitted jumping saddle. At the upper levels, riders usually have a saddle specifically designed for cross-country, giving them more freedom for such fences as [[bank (obstacle)|banks and drops]].

Dressage tack is usually black in color, with a [[saddle blanket|white square pad]], giving a formal look. Except for the upper levels, where a [[double bridle]] is permitted, horses may only be ridden in [[snaffle bit]]s. There are strict guidelines as to what type of snaffle may be used, and the more severe types (such as any twisted bit) are prohibited. If a double bridle is used, a plain cavesson or crank [[noseband]] must be worn. With a snaffle bridle, the rider is also free to use the drop, flash, or grackle noseband, with the flash and plain cavesson being the most common. [[Breastplate (tack)|Breastplates]] are also fairly common in dressage at an event, despite the fact that they are not seen at regular dressage shows. Other forms of equipment, such as [[Martingale (tack)|martingale]]s, protective boots, gadgets/training devices, bit guards, [[polo wraps]], or tail wraps are not allowed during the test.

[[Image:R3DE StadiumJump.jpg|right|thumb|Horse and rider well turned-out for the stadium jumping phase. Note the rider wears a medical armband.]]
In show jumping, the rider uses a jumping saddle, usually with a square or fitted white pad. Rules on tack are less-stringent, and most forms of bridling and bitting are allowed, including the use of [[gag bit]]s, [[hackamore]]s, and any type of noseband. Breastplates and open front boots are usually worn. [[Martingale (tack)|Running martingales]] are also allowed, but must be used with rein stops. Standing and Irish martingales are not allowed.

For the cross-country phase, the rider usually uses similar tack as for the show jumping. However, cross country boots are used for extra protection, to help prevent injury if they were to hit the solid obstacles. Most horses that wear shoes are also fitted with [[horse shoe studs]], to prevent slipping. At the upper levels, riders may also apply a grease or lard to the front of the horse's legs, to help the horse slide over fences if they hang a leg. Riders also tend to color-coordinate their cross-country tack to their colors. For example, using the same color saddle pad and tape for their boots, to match their shirt and protective vest.

'''Exercise prescription''' commonly refers to the specific plan of fitness-related activities that are designed for a specified purpose, which is often developed by a fitness or rehabilitation specialist for the client or patient. Due to the specific and unique needs and interests of the client/patient, the goal of exercise prescription should be focused on motivation and customization, thus making achieving goals more likely to become successful.&lt;ref name=EMedicine88648&gt;{{EMedicine|article|88648|Exercise Prescription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Patient referral ==
In the United Kingdom there is a scheme called "Exercise on prescription" in which doctors are able to prescribe [[exercise]] to those with conditions that benefit from it, such as [[asthma]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], or [[obesity]].  The initiative particularly aimed to lower the rate of [[heart disease]]. National standards for such initiatives from doctors were established by the  [[Department of Health]] in 2001. Exercise on prescription aims to prevent deterioration of conditions, and views exercise as a preventative health measure. Fitness classes or a course at the local gym are available on prescription at a reduced rate to people who might benefit from them. It aims to make it easier for people to follow their doctors' advice about taking more exercise or losing weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/1261950.stm |title=Exercise on prescription |publisher=BBC News |date=April 5, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such preventative measures hope to lead to savings for the National Health Service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/Pages/exercise-for-depression.aspx] Exercise on prescription (Times)&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Researchers in New Zealand have also discussed the benefits of exercise referral by medical practitioners there.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hi-mag.com/healthinsurance/article.do?articleid=20001764961 Analysis: Workplace Wellbeing{{dead link|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In New Zealand it is known as a green prescription, while in the United States a similar initiative is known as [[Exercise is Medicine]].
A green prescription is a referral given by a doctor or nurse to a patient, with exercise and lifestyle goals written on them.
The term, used by health practitioners in New Zealand draws parallel to the usual [[medical prescription|prescription]]s given to patients for medications, and emphasises the importance of exercise in improving their condition, and not relying on drugs.
The green prescription is written after discussing the issues and goals in the consultation.
Studies have shown that an increase in exercise, better sense of well-being, and a decrease in [[blood pressure]] results from using the method. A decreased risk of [[coronary heart disease]] has not been shown. This was shown in two studies, one by Swinburn (1998), that surveyed patients in [[Auckland]] and [[Dunedin]].&lt;ref name="pmid9491025"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Swinburn BA, Walter LG, Arroll B, Tilyard MW, Russell DG |title=The green prescription study: a randomized controlled trial of written exercise advice provided by general practitioners |journal=Am J Public Health |volume=88 |issue=2 |pages=288–91 |year=1998 |pmid=9491025 |pmc=1508188 |doi=10.2105/ajph.88.2.288}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other was Elley (2003) and was done in 42 practices in the same region of New Zealand.&lt;ref name="pmid12689976"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Elley CR, Kerse N, Arroll B, Robinson E |title=Effectiveness of counselling patients on physical activity in general practice: cluster randomised controlled trial |journal=BMJ |volume=326 |issue=7393 |pages=793 |year=2003 |pmid=12689976 |pmc=153098 |doi=10.1136/bmj.326.7393.793}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[General practitioner]]s like the idea as it formalises what they are telling the patient about how their lifestyle changes are necessary (Swinburn 1997).&lt;ref name="pmid9406491"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Swinburn BA, Walter LG, Arroll B, Tilyard MW, Russell DG |title=Green prescriptions: attitudes and perceptions of general practitioners towards prescribing exercise |journal=Br J Gen Pract |volume=47 |issue=422 |pages=567–9 |year=1997 |pmid=9406491 |pmc=1313106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research in Australia has suggested that an exercise prescription program would be very beneficial and many ICU physiotherapists are already performing this practice, however there is no national standards to govern how this practice is administered so there is great variety in the ways this is administered therefore more research is needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Skinner |first1=Elizabeth H. |last2=Berney |first2=Susan |last3=Warrillow |first3=Stephen |last4=Denehy |first4=Linda |title=Rehabilitation and exercise prescription in Australian intensive care units |journal=Physiotherapy |volume=94 |issue=3 |year=2008 |pages=220–9 |doi=10.1016/j.physio.2007.11.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=O’Hagan |first1=Ciara |last2=De Vito |first2=Giuseppe |last3=Boreham |first3=Colin A.

== For specific diseases ==

=== Osteoarthritis ===
Studies show that exercise prescription aids in both preventing and minimizing the effects of joint disorders such as [[osteoarthritis]]. Evidence shows that in addition to the general physiological, psychological and functional benefits gained from exercise, greater quadriceps strength has a mitigating effect on knee joint pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=O'Grady |first1=Michael |last2=Fletcher |first2=Jacquelyn |last3=Ortiz |first3=Susan |title=Therapeutic and physical fitness exercise prescription for older adults with joint disease: an evidence-based approach |journal=Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=617–46 |year=2000 |pmid=10989515 |doi=10.1016/S0889-857X(05)70159-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Depression ===
A large body of research indicates that exercise prescription has beneficial effects for patients suffering depression. One study shows a significant improvement for a randomized group of women with [[major depressive disorder]] engaging in a twice-weekly resistance training program compared to a control group. The reasons for this marked change is thought to have biochemical, physiological and [[psychosocial]] aspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stanton |first1=Robert |last2=Happell |first2=Brenda M. |title=An Exercise Prescription Primer for People with Depression |journal=Issues in Mental Health Nursing |volume=34 |issue=8 |pages=626–30 |year=2013 |pmid=23909675 |doi=10.3109/01612840.2012.758207 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) ===
{{See also|Peripheral arterial disease}}
Blockage or closing of the arteries of the lower limbs impairs blood flow to the legs and results in significant reduction in physical capacity. Alternate exercise prescriptions to walking are considered. [[Aerobic exercise]]s such as arm-cranking or cycling are recommended.  Risk factors for disease progression should also be taken into account when aiming to improve waling ability. Functional capacity should be determined prior to commencement of prescribe exercise programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Askew |first1=Christopher D. |last2=Parmenter |first2=Belinda |last3=Leicht |first3=Anthony S. |last4=Walker |first4=Philip J. |last5=Golledge |first5=Jonathan |title=Exercise &amp; Sports Science Australia (ESSA) position statement on exercise prescription for patients with peripheral arterial disease and intermittent claudication |journal=Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport |volume=17 |issue=6 |pages=623–9 |year=2014 |pmid=24315956 |doi=10.1016/j.jsams.2013.10.251 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diabetes mellitus ===
The number of individuals diagnosed with [[diabetes mellitus]] are rapidly increasing and a lot of evidence suggests this is due to an insufficiently active lifestyle.&lt;ref name=pmid21621458&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hordern |first1=Matthew D. |last2=Dunstan |first2=David W. |last3=Prins |first3=Johannes B. |last4=Baker |first4=Michael K. |last5=Singh |first5=Maria A. Fiatarone |last6=Coombes |first6=Jeff S. |title=Exercise prescription for patients with type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetes: A position statement from Exercise and Sport Science Australia |journal=Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=25–31 |year=2012 |pmid=21621458 |doi=10.1016/j.jsams.2011.04.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Benefits of exercise include stress reduction, reduced risk of heart disease, lowers blood pressure, helps control weight and aids insulin in improving management of diabetes. Exercise that is not too strenuous is recommended. Such activities may include walking, swimming, gardening, cycling or golfing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diabetes and Exercise - Keeping Active|url=http://www.diabetesaustralia.com.au/Living-with-Diabetes/Keeping-Active/|website=Diabetes Australia|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Incidental activities are encouraged, such as using the stairs instead of an escalator/lift or walking short distances instead of driving. 
Dr Gebel, who works at James Cook University's Centre for Chronic Disease Prevention conducted a study reporting increased health benefits through incorporation of more vigorous exercise. He stated that this could include 'vigorous gardening', not necessarily meaning going to the gym.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walton|first1=Alice|title=Vigorous Exercise Linked To Longer Life, Study Says|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/alicegwalton/2015/04/06/vigorous-exercise-may-lengthen-lives-study-finds/|website=Forbs|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Diabetes Australia suggest 30 minutes of exercise daily as a suitable target, which can be divided into three 10-minute sessions throughout the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diabetes and Exercise - Keeping Active|url=http://www.diabetesaustralia.com.au/Living-with-Diabetes/Keeping-Active/|website=Diabetes Australia|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Exercise programs however should be tailored and delivered by individuals with appropriate qualifications.

== Exercise recommendations ==
According to Exercise and Sport Science Australia, a minimum amount of 210 minutes of moderate intensity exercise or 125 minutes of vigorous intensity exercise should be performed per week. Exercise should include both aerobic and resistance training. For greater health benefits, exercise should be performed regularly with no more than a two-day gap between training sessions.&lt;ref name=pmid21621458/&gt;

=== Elderly ===
Research has found that having a well planned exercise routine can greatly benefit the elderly. It an reduce the risks of coronary heart disease, diabetes mellitus and insulin resilience, hypertension and obesity as well as vast improvements in bone density and muscle mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mazzeo |first1=Robert S. |last2=Tanaka |first2=Hirofumi |title=Exercise Prescription for the Elderly |journal=Sports Medicine |volume=31 |issue=11 |pages=809–18 |year=2001 |pmid=11583105 |doi=10.2165/00007256-200131110-00003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exercise program development ==
Exercise prescription is designed to modulate acute exercise programming variables to create the adaptations desired by the individual or sport. With  aerobic exercise prescription, the type of exercise, duration of exercise, frequency, and duration is adjusted.  For [[resistance exercise]] prescription, the type of exercise, total session volume, rest period, frequency, and intensity are determined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=William J. |last1=Kraemer |first2=Steven J. |last2=Fleck |first3=Michael R. |last3=Deschenes |year=2011 |chapter=Exercise Testing for Health, Physical Fitness, and Predicting Sport Performance |pages=385–414 |title=Exercise Physiology: Integrating Theory and Application |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |isbn=978-0-7817-8351-4}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Prescription of [[stretching]] and other activities is also commonly seen.
Exercise prescription can be divided into 5 components:&lt;ref name=EMedicine88648/&gt;
*Type of exercise or activity (eg, walking, swimming, cycling)
*Specific workloads (eg, watts, walking speed)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vogiatzis |first1=Ioannis |title=Physiological Response to Moderate Exercise Workloads in a Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program in Patients With Varying Degrees of Airflow Obstruction |journal=Chest |volume=116 |issue=5 |pages=1200–7 |year=1999 |pmid=10559076 |doi=10.1378/chest.116.5.1200 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Duration and frequency of the activity or exercise session

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5641">The '''Case Fresno''' is the name assigned by the [[Catalonia]] media and public opinion to the [[Federation of International Roller Sports]] (FIRS) assembly held at [[Fresno, California|Fresno]], [[California]], on 26 November 2004. It meant that for the first time in history, an international sport team that had been accepted provisionally was later not accepted definitely. At the same time, it was the first time that a regional sport team (Catalonia) had been registered with the opposition of the state the region belonged to ([[Spain]]). The Spanish sport organizations actively lobbied against the Catalonia membership among the members of the assembly. At the Fresno assembly, the membership application was rejected (8–114). However, the [[Federació Catalana de Patinatge]] brought the case to the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] (TAS) at [[Lausanne]], which admitted irregularities in the assembly (notably the lack of secrecy in the vote), invalidated the vote, and forced the FIRS to repeat the vote following the FIRS statute rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tas-cas.org/fr/pdf/catalans.PDF |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-11-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051019233616/http://www.tas-cas.org/fr/pdf/catalans.PDF |archivedate=2005-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An extraordinary FIRS assembly was held in Rome on November 24, 2005, and again rejected the membership application of the Catalan federation (125–43).

After being granted a temporary membership, Catalonia played the World Championship B, at [[Macau]], ([[China]]), in October 2004, winning it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurosport.es/home/pages/v4/l6/s155/sport_lng6_spo155_sto650587.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-11-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050426230823/http://www.eurosport.es/home/pages/v4/l6/s155/sport_lng6_spo155_sto650587.shtml |archivedate=2005-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Catalonia qualified to play the full World Championship, where it played in the same group as Spain.

==Spain's opposition==
Some [[Catalonia|Catalan]] media have denounced the pressions by the Spanish government and sport organizations on the members of the assembly [http://catalanhockey.blogspot.com/2004/11/plot-reveals.html].

Representatives from [[Chile]] [http://usuarios.lycos.es/fresno05/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=19] or [[Italy]] (Sabatino Aracu, member of [[Forza Italia]]) [http://www.forzaitalia.org/gruppo/deputati/leggiComunicati.asp?codiceDeputato=17&amp;news_id=2341] would allegedly suffered from such pressions or receive instructions from their national governments.

The [[Czech Republic]] representative Radek Pavelec admitted that his federation had received pressures from the Spanish government [http://catalanhockey.blogspot.com/2004/11/plot-reveals.html].

In addition, a letter of the Consejo Superior de Deported (CSD, the Spanish Council for Sports) to the [[Colombia]]n federation in which the Spaniards were asking for the vote against Catalonia has been made public. In that letter the CSD stated that the recognition of [[Catalonia]] would alter the Spanish sport national unity and would create a wrong precedent.
The same letter was sent to some other South American federations [http://usuarios.lycos.es/fresno05/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=65].

The [[Germany|German]] representative admitted that she was contacted by the German MP for Sport demanding the vote against Catalonia. Literally he asked her to make sure she was coming back from Fresno with a "no" against Catalonia.

==Repetition of the vote in Rome==

On 29 November 2005, the FIRS assembly, meeting in Rome, he repeated the final vote on the admission of the Catalan Federation of Skating.

In this case the method of voting was secret and the president of the Catalan Ramon Basiana was able to defend the nomination.

The extraordinary meeting in Rome of the FIRS rejected by 125 votes to 43 for admission as a full member of the Catalan Federation of Skating

[[File:Front-Office-JGI.jpg|thumb|Front office at [[Jain University]], Bangalore]]
The '''front office''' or '''reception''' is an area where visitors arrive and first encounter a staff at a place of [[business]]. Front office staff will deal with whatever question the visitor has and put them in contact with a relevant person at the company. Broadly speaking, the front office includes roles that affect the [[Revenue|revenues]] of the business. The term ''front office'' is in contrast to the term ''[[back office]]'' which refers to a company's operations, personnel, [[accounting]], [[payroll]] and financial departments which do not interact directly with customers.

The front office receives information about the [[Customer|customers]] and will then pass this on to the correct department within the company. The front office can also contact the [[marketing]] or sales department should the customers have questions. The company needs to give training to the front [[Office management|office manager]] as this position will come in contact with customers the most.

The most common work for the front office staff will be to get in touch with customers and help out internally in the office. Staff working at the front office can also deal with simple tasks, such as [[printing]] and [[typing]] tasks and sorting [[Email|emails]]. Although front office staff might only need to perform tasks such as answering the phone, using the printer and [[Fax|fax machine]], training is still needed on these tasks.

Front office is related to a [[service delivery system]], where employees engage with customers. It uses the parameter of [[labor intensity]] to figure out the distinctive characteristics of a service.

==Hotels==

At [[hotel]]s, ''front office'' refers to the [[front desk]] or reception area or the core operations department of the hotel. This would include the reception and front desk, as well as reservations, sales and marketing, [[housekeeping]] and [[concierge]]. This is the place where guests go when they arrive at the hotel. Employees working in the front office will confirm guest reservations and also attend to guest complaints and queries.

The employees who work in the [[Lobby (room)|lobby]] of the hotel are also part of the front office as they deal with guest directly. The concierge, [[cashier]], porter, and mailing service are included in the front office.

The important area of Front office are a. Reception b. Information c. Cash

==Sports==
In some sports, the front office usually gets in touch with the players and organizes activities for them. The front office staff is usually the person who has the highest position in the sports team, who can control the whole team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What does front office staff do?|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-does-front-office-staff-do.htm|website=wiseGEEK|accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges faced==

The front office staff might lack motivation sometimes as they do the same work repeatedly on a daily basis and usually their pay is the lowest compared to other staff. This is a very important fact to take note of as this might affect the profitability and efficiency of the company as this staff member will directly deal with customers the most. This staff member might have high stress levels as they might have to deal with bad-tempered customers and a lot of complaints, making it hard to maintain good services. 

One of the biggest challenges that front office staff might face in the hotel industry would be over booking. These bad communication and organisation skills might lead to a bad reputation for the company and unsatisfactory services to customers.

Front office staff should receive continuous training as this will improve their customer service. Salary increases can also provide more motivation.

The phone system could be configured in such a way that the company can track the calls that are missed by the front office. This can help them get back to the customers as soon as possible.

The '''Gatorade shower''', also known as the '''Gatorade dunk''' or the '''Gatorade bath''', is an sports tradition that involves players surreptitiously dumping a cooler full of liquid (most commonly [[Gatorade]] mixed with [[ice cube|ice]]) over the head of their coach (or occasionally a high-profile assistant coach, star player, or team owner in professional leagues) following a meaningful win, such as the [[Super Bowl]], [[World Series]] or other major sporting event.  This includes all levels of play including [[Little League World Series]], high school, college (NCAA) and professional teams (e.g. NBA Finals or Stanley Cup).

==Start of tradition==
The tradition began with the [[New York Giants]] football team in the mid-1980s. According to several sources, including [[Jim Burt (football player)|Jim Burt]] of the [[New York Giants|Giants]], it began on October 28, 1984, when the Giants beat the Washington Redskins 37–13, and Burt performed the action on [[Bill Parcells]] after being angry over the coach's treatment of him that week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Borden |first=Sam |date=21 January 2012 |title=A Splashy Tradition, Gatorade-Style |work= |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/21/sports/football/a-splashy-football-tradition-gatorade-style.html?hp |accessdate=23 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkqrPxxi0F4 1984 Giants dunk on YouTube], accessed November 14, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Burt insisted that [[Harry Carson]] dumped the Gatorade on Parcells, because Carson was a favorite and wouldn't get in trouble.&lt;ref name=rovell /&gt; Former [[Chicago Bears]] defensive tackle [[Dan Hampton]] claims he invented the shower, also in 1984, when the Bears dunked [[Mike Ditka]] upon clinching the NFC Central &amp;ndash; but that took place a month later in November.&lt;ref name=rovell /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title=NFLFilms 1984 Chicago Bears Season Highlights|medium=Television production|publisher=[[NFL Films]]|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2tEyu1YuTo#t=18m20s}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon gained national attention in the [[1986 New York Giants season|1986 Giants season]]. Parcells was doused after 17 victories that season, culminating with [[Super Bowl XXI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/sports_blog/2011/09/did-the-new-york-giants-originate-the-gatorade-shower.html | title=Did the New York Giants originate the Gatorade shower? | date=September 14, 2011 | publisher=Los Angeles Times | accessdate=February 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://proxy.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=rovell/051014 | title=How the dunk was born | first=Darren | last=Rovell | publisher=ESPN | accessdate=February 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable examples==
[[Boston Celtics]] coach [[Doc Rivers]] was reported to be the first [[NBA]] coach to receive a Gatorade shower when his team won the [[2008 NBA Finals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stein|first=Marc|title=Three Party triumph: KG leads, Allen scorches and Pierce takes MVP|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/playoffs2008/columns/story?columnist=stein_marc&amp;page=Game6-080618|publisher=ESPN.com|date=18 June 2008|accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Pierce]] dumped a cooler of red Gatorade over Rivers as the Celtics closed out Game 6 to clinch their first NBA title in 22 years. Then-[[Los Angeles Lakers]] coach [[Phil Jackson]] is the only NBA head coach to receive a Gatorade shower twice, as the Lakers won back-to-back NBA Finals in [[2009 NBA Finals|2009]] (at [[Amway Arena]] in [[Orlando, Florida]]) and [[2010 NBA Finals|2010]].  [[Dallas Mavericks]] coach [[Rick Carlisle]] likewise received the honors when Mavericks celebrated their [[2011 NBA Finals|first NBA championship]] in 2011.  [[Miami Heat]] head coach [[Erik Spoelstra]] received the same treatment from [[Udonis Haslem]] when the Heat won the [[2012 NBA Finals]] at the [[American Airlines Arena]] in 2012.

[[George Allen (American football coach)|George Allen]], coach of the Long Beach State football team and a former Hall of Fame NFL head coach, was doused with ice water from a Gatorade bucket as his team celebrated its victory over the University of Nevada on November 17, 1990.  Allen became ill shortly afterward and died of ventricular fibrillation six weeks later.

[[Kentucky Wildcats football|Kentucky Wildcats]] coach [[Guy Morriss]] is one of few coaches ever to receive a Gatorade shower and lose a game. This occurred on November 9, 2002, during the [[Bluegrass Miracle]], when [[LSU Tigers football|LSU]] defeated [[Kentucky Wildcats football|Kentucky]].  Coach Morriss was showered immediately before [[Marcus Randall]] threw a [[Hail Mary pass]] to [[Devery Henderson]] to win on the final play of the game. On November 24, 2018, LSU coach [[Ed Orgeron]] received a gatorade shower after an apparent LSU game ending interception. Texas A&amp;M eventually beat LSU 74-72 in 7 overtimes.

Many [[baseball]] players give a teammate who has just hit a [[walk-off home run]], or a pitcher who has thrown a no-hitter, a Gatorade shower while they are giving a post-game interview on the field. [[Salvador Pérez]] of the [[Kansas City Royals]] is known for giving a Gatorade shower to teammates after every home win and notable away wins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=DeAnn|last2=Fanning|first2=Brad|title=Royals catcher Salvy Perez's post-game celebrations make big splash|url=http://www.kctv5.com/story/29568919/royals-catcher-salvy-perezs-post-game-celebrations-make-big-splash|website=kctv5.com|publisher=KCTV|accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rittman|first1=Emily|last2=Pimentel|first2=Donovan|title=Perez's Gatorade baths are keeping one dry cleaner busy|url=http://www.kctv5.com/story/30226435/perezs-gatorade-baths-are-keeping-one-dry-cleaner-busy|website=kctv5.com|publisher=KCTV|accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Torres|first1=Maria|title=Four years of the Salvy Splash: How one Gatorade bath became part of Royals fan lore|url=http://www.kansascity.com/sports/mlb/kansas-city-royals/article175289156.html|work=The Kansas City Star|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other times, baseball players receive a [[cream pie]] to the face in lieu of a Gatorade shower.

The [[Australia]]n [[National Rugby League|NRL]] rugby league club [[Melbourne Storm]]'s players have given their coach, [[Craig Bellamy (rugby league)|Craig Bellamy]], a Gatorade shower every time they have won the premiership under him, including in [[2007 NRL grand final|2007]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.batemansbaypost.com.au/news/local/sport/rugby-league/crosss-night-of-triumph/683365.aspx|title=Cross’s night of triumph|first=JOSH|last=GIDNEY|date=3 October 2007|website=batemansbaypost.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[2009 NRL grand final|2009]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/nrl/bellamy-i-have-got-my-satisfaction/story-e6frfgbo-1225783050202|title=Bellamy - I have got my satisfaction|website=heraldsun.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[2012 NRL grand final|2012]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theroar.com.au/2012/10/01/wiz-bellamy-nrls-master-coach/|title=WIZ: Bellamy NRL’s master coach|date=1 October 2012|website=theroar.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Australian Football League|AFL]], players are customarily given a shower if they win in their first game with their club.

In [[cricket]] the [[Australian cricket team]] players gave their coach [[Darren Lehmann]] a Gatorade shower on two occasions, during post celebrations after his team won the [[2013-14 Ashes series]] and during a post match interview after the [[2015 Cricket World Cup Final]].

In 2016, the coach of Brazilian team [[SE Palmeiras]] received a Gatorade Shower during his first interview after receiving the 2016 [[Brasileirão]] title, also was the first time known that someone received a Gatorade shower in first division of Brazilian soccer &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/esporteinterativo/videos/10156075590913504|title=Esporte Interativo|website=www.facebook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; ,the team did again after 2018 title.

==Variations==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}
Many teams do not use Gatorade but instead use water or another substitute; for example, the [[Florida State Seminoles]] use [[Powerade]], due to their sponsorship agreement with Powerade manufacturer [[The Coca-Cola Company]] and Gatorade's affiliation with rival [[University of Florida]]. After [[Michigan State University]]'s win over Penn State in 2010, Spartan players dumped a Gatorade bucket filled with green and white confetti on head coach [[Mark Dantonio]]. This was done because of the cold temperature and Dantonio's heart condition.

The tradition has become a mainstay of the Super Bowl; so much so that numerous gambling websites have established various '[[Proposition bet|prop bets]]' on situations during the game.

As the tradition has evolved, not all showers are reserved for championship games.  Gatorade showers have occurred after key victories that were not championship games, after the defeat of a rival, after the snapping of a losing streak, or after the snapping of an opponent's winning streak.

Generally, it happens during an interview. Sometimes, the "victim" is the journalist. Another variation is shaving cream on the face, with a towel.

==Tradition documented==
In 2005, [[ESPN]] sports business writer Darren Rovell published a book entitled ''First in Thirst: How Gatorade Turned the Science of Sweat into a Cultural Phenomenon'', in which he documented, among other things, the story behind the Gatorade dunking phenomenon.&lt;ref name=rovell&gt;{{cite book|last=Rovell|first=Darren|title=First in thirst: how Gatorade turned the science of sweat into a cultural phenomenon|year=2006|publisher=AMACOM Books|pages=77–91|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uNJIXCE7cSkC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{about|the general use of the gold medal as a prize (including at the Olympic Games)|individual gold medals|List of gold medal awards|other uses}}
[[File:1964 Winter Olympics medals.JPG|thumb|The gold, [[Silver medal|silver]] and [[bronze medal]]s of the [[1964 Winter Olympics|1964 Olympic Winter Games]] ([[Olympic Museum]]).]]

A '''gold medal''' is a [[medal]] awarded for highest achievement in a non-military field. Its name derives from the use of at least a fraction of [[gold]] in form of plating or alloying in its manufacture.

Since the eighteenth century, gold medals have been awarded in the arts, for example, by the Royal Danish Academy, usually as a symbol of an award to give an outstanding student some financial freedom. Others offer only the prestige of the award. Many organizations now award gold medals either annually or extraordinarily, including [[UNESCO]] and various academic societies.

While some gold medals are solid [[gold]], others are gold-plated or [[silver-gilt]], like those of the [[Olympic Games]], the [[Lorentz Medal]], the United States [[Congressional Gold Medal]]  and the [[Nobel Prize]] medal.  Nobel Prize medals consist of 18 [[Karat (purity)|karat]] [[green gold]] plated with 24 karat gold. Before 1980 they were struck in 23 karat gold.

==Military origins==
Before the establishment of standard military awards, e.g., the Medal of Honor, it was common practice to have a medal specially created to provide national recognition for a significant military or naval victory or accomplishment. In the United States, Congress would enact a resolution asking the President to reward those responsible. The commanding officer would receive a gold medal and his officers silver medals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Polkcounty.org|url=http://www.polkcounty.org/timonier/speaks/book21.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041106191448/http://www.polkcounty.org/timonier/speaks/book21.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2004-11-06|title=Polk County History site "Gold Medals All Around"|df=}} &lt;/ref&gt; Other countries similarly honored their military and naval victors in a similar fashion.

==Competition medals==
[[File:AwardNeckRibbonAndMedal wb.jpg|thumb|A medal on a ribbon designed to be worn around the winner's neck.]]
Medals have historically been given as prizes in various types of competitive activities, especially athletics.

Traditionally, medals are made of the following metals:

# [[Gold]] (or another yellow metal, e.g., [[brass]])
# [[Silver]] (or another grey metal, e.g., [[steel]])
# [[Bronze]]

Occasionally, [[Platinum]] medals can be awarded.

These metals designate the first three [[Ages of Man]] in [[Greek mythology]]: the [[Golden Age]], when men lived among the gods, the [[Silver Age]], where youth lasted a hundred years, and the [[Greek Heroic Age|Bronze Age]], the era of heroes.

The custom of awarding the sequence of gold, [[silver medal|silver]], and [[bronze medal]]s for the first three highest achievers dates from at least the 18th century, with the National Association of Amateur Athletes in the United States awarding such medals as early as 1884.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eagle.brooklynpubliclibrary.org/Repository/BEG/1884/08/15/008-BEG-1884-08-15-01-SINGLE.pdf Brooklyn Eagle, 15 August 1884 "Preparing for the Championship"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501034317/http://eagle.brooklynpubliclibrary.org/Repository/BEG/1884/08/15/008-BEG-1884-08-15-01-SINGLE.pdf |date=1 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This standard was adopted for Olympic competition at the [[1904 Summer Olympics]]. At the 1896 event, silver was awarded to winners and bronze to runners-up, while at 1900 other prizes were given, not medals.

==Olympic Games==
{{main|Olympic medal}}
[[File:Losanna, museo olimpico, medaglie di 1896 atene.JPG|thumb|At the [[1896 Summer Olympics]], the winners received a [[silver medal]]. Since 1904, the winners receive a gold medal, the second-place finishers receive a [[silver medal]] and the third-place finishers receive a [[bronze medal]].]]

At the modern [[Olympic Games]], winners of a sporting discipline receive a gold medal in recognition of their achievement.

At the [[Ancient Olympic Games]] only one winner per event was crowned with [[kotinos]], an olive wreath made of wild olive leaves from a sacred tree near the temple of Zeus at Olympia. [[Aristophanes]] in [[Plutus (play)|Plutus]] makes a remark why victorious athletes are crowned with wreath made of wild olive instead of gold.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristophanes]], [[Plutus (play)|Plutus]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0040%3Acard%3D535 585].&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Herodotus]] describes a story that explains why there were only a few Greek men at the [[Battle of Thermopylae]] since "all other men were participating in the Olympic Games" and that the prize for the winner was "an olive-wreath". When [[Tigranes]], an Armenian general learned this, he uttered to his leader: "Good heavens! what kind of men are these against whom you have brought us to fight? Men who do not compete for possessions, but for honour".&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, The Histories, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+8.26&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126 Hdt. 8.26]&lt;/ref&gt; Hence medals were not awarded at the ancient Olympic Games.

At the [[1896 Summer Olympics]], winners received a [[silver medal]] and the second-place finisher received a [[bronze medal]]. In [[1900 Summer Olympics|1900]], most winners received cups or trophies instead of medals. The next three Olympics ([[1904 Summer Olympics|1904]], [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]], 1912) awarded the winners solid gold medals, but the medals themselves were smaller. The use of gold rapidly declined with the onset of the [[World War I|First World War]] and also with the onset of the [[World War II|Second World War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/09/living/olympians-bite-medals/index.html|author=Melonyce McAfee|title=Why Olympians bite their medals|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=August 10, 2012|accessdate=August 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last series of Olympic medals to be made of solid gold were awarded at the [[1912 Summer Olympics]] in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]].

Olympic Gold medals are required to be made from at least 92.5% silver, and must contain a minimum of 6 grams of gold.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|url= http://history1900s.about.com/od/greateventsofthecentury/a/olympicfacts.htm |author=Jennifer Rosenberg|title=Interesting Olympic Facts|accessdate=December 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; All Olympic medals must be at least 60mm in diameter and 3mm thick.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; [[Mint (coin)|Minting]] the medals is the responsibility of the Olympic host. From [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]] through [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]] the design was always the same: the obverse showed a generic design by [[Florence|Florentine]] artist [[Giuseppe Cassioli]] of Greek goddess [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]] with Rome's [[Colloseum]] in the background and text naming the host city; the reverse showed another generic design of Nike saluting an Olympic champion.

From the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] through [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000]], Cassioli's design (or a slight modification) remained on the obverse with a custom design by the host city on the reverse. Noting that Cassioli's design showed a Roman amphitheater for what originally were Greek games, a new obverse design was commissioned for the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] in [[Athens]]. For the [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Beijing Olympics]] medals had a diameter of 70mm and were 6mm thick, with the front displaying a winged figure of victory and the back showed a Beijing Olympics symbol surrounded by an inset jade circle.

[[Winter Olympics]] medals have been of more varied design. The silver and bronze medals have always borne the same designs.

==Other gold medal awards==
The award of a gold medal, often coupled with the award of silver and bronze medals to the next place finishers, has been adopted in other sports competitions and in other competitive fields, such as music and writing, as well as some competitive games. Typically bronze medals are awarded only to third place, but in some contests there is some variety, such as International [[barbershop music]] contests where bronze medals are awarded for third, fourth, and fifth place.

'''''Gracie''''' is a 2007 American [[Sports film|sports]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[Davis Guggenheim]]. It stars [[Carly Schroeder]] as Gracie Bowen, [[Dermot Mulroney]] as Bryan Bowen, [[Elisabeth Shue]] as Lindsay Bowen, [[Jesse Lee Soffer]] as Johnny Bowen, and [[Andrew Shue]] as Coach Owen Clark.&lt;ref name="Gracie"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/647371/Gracie/full-credits.html|title=Gracie|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]] ([[Time Warner]])|location=[[Atlanta]]|accessdate=July 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Gracie'' takes place in [[New Jersey]], United States in 1978, before 1972's [[Title IX]] had taken much effect in women's college sports&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/27/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/27artsnj.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin|title=A Star's (Pre-Celebrity) Turn on the Soccer Field |last=Cahillane|first=Kevin|date=May 27, 2007|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|accessdate=2008-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and when organized [[women's soccer]] was still very rare in the United States. Gracie, the film's central [[protagonist]], overcomes the loss of her brother by convincing her family and school to allow her to play [[Football (soccer)|varsity soccer]] on an all-boys team. The story is partially based on the childhood experiences of [[Elisabeth Shue]], who was one of the producers in addition to being the wife of Davis Guggenheim, the director, as well as a cast member.

The novelization of ''Gracie'', written by [[Suzanne Weyn]], was released in June 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Gracie-Medallion-Editions-Young-Readers/dp/1557047790|title=Gracie|first=Suzanne|last=Weyn|authorlink=Suzanne Weyn|publisher=[[William Morrow and Company]]|location=[[New York City]]|year=2007|edition=1st|series=Medallion Editions for Young Readers|isbn=978-1557047793}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
In the year 1978, Gracie Bowen, a 15-year-old [[tomboy]] who lives in [[South Orange, New Jersey]], is crazy about [[soccer]], as are her three brothers and their former soccer star father. Although Gracie wants to join her brothers and neighbor Kyle in the nightly practices her father runs, she is discouraged by everyone except her older brother, Johnny.

Johnny, Gracie and Kyle attend [[Columbia High School (New Jersey)|Columbia High School]], where Johnny is the captain and star player for the varsity soccer team. After missing a shot at the end of a game, the despondent Johnny drives off with a friend's car and dies in a traffic accident.

Struggling with grief, Gracie decides that she wants to replace her brother on the team. Her father does not believe that girls should play soccer, telling her she is neither tough nor talented enough. Her mother is a [[nurse]] who lacks the competitive drive of the rest of her family and fears for Gracie's safety. Her mother later tells Gracie that she would have liked to become a [[surgeon]], but that option had not been available to her as a woman.

Rejected and depressed, Gracie begins to rebel; she stops doing her schoolwork, is caught cheating on an exam, and experiments with wild and self-destructive behavior. She is finally caught by her father almost having sex with a guy she met near the docks after telling her friend, "I want to do something that I've never done before." This serves as a wake-up call for her parents, particularly her father. He quits his job to work with her on her soccer training.

When the school board rejects her request to play boys' soccer, Gracie files an appeal. Citing the newly passed [[Title IX]], Gracie argues that since a girls' soccer team does not exist, she should be allowed to play on the boys' varsity soccer team. The school board allows her to try out for the team. After a very rough tryout, she makes the [[junior varsity]] team and has to decide if she is willing to settle for playing at that level. She decides to make the most of playing on junior varsity.

One of the coaches asks her to come up to the main team for their championship game. After saying no at first she finally goes. Gracie watches from the bench as the game goes to [[sudden death (sport)|sudden death overtime]]. New captain Kyle gets hurt and Gracie goes in for him, scoring the winning goal with a move that her dad taught her.

==Historical background==
The premise of the film rests upon the conflicting expectations of two different [[United States|American]] generations. As Gracie's parents were most likely both products of what is now referred to as the "[[Silent Generation]]" of children born during the [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]], they would have been raised to adhere to traditional [[gender role]]s.&lt;ref name="beliefnet.com"&gt;[http://www.beliefnet.com/story/219/story_21934.html 'Trying to Live a Passionate Life': Interview with Andrew Shue]&lt;/ref&gt; This would have included discouraging a girl from participating in "boys' sports" such as soccer, as opposed to "girls' sports" such as [[cheerleading]] or [[gymnastics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3702/is_200610/ai_n17193792 Girlie Girls and Manly Men: Children's Stigma Consciousness of Gender in Sports and Physical Activities]&lt;/ref&gt; Gracie, on the other hand, came of age during the 1970s, when [[second-wave feminism|new and controversial ideas about gender]] were being introduced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.womenssportsfoundation.org/cgi-bin/iowa/issues/business/article.html?record=882 The Future of Women's Sport and Fitness] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012110003/http://www.womenssportsfoundation.org/cgi-bin/iowa/issues/business/article.html?record=882 |date=2007-10-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eleanor Ringel Gillespie, critic for the ''[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]],'' noted an additional generation gap between those in the film and those in the audience, many of whom grew up with the [[United States women's national soccer team]] (which played its first game in 1985) as a reality:

{{quote|text=Not so long ago – 1978, actually – girls were not treated equally with boys when it came to school sports ... what happens in ''Gracie'' must seem like a tale from the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] to today's young athletes, something akin to [[Saint George and the Dragon|slaying a dragon]] or [[Snow White|housekeeping for seven dwarfs]]. But think of it this way: In 1978, future gold medalist and [[1991 FIFA Women's World Cup|World Cup]] star [[Mia Hamm]] was only 6 years old.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessatlanta.com/movies/movies/etc/getCriticReview.jspd?criticReviewId=3781 Formula, but not formulaic] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014102149/http://www.accessatlanta.com/movies/movies/etc/getCriticReview.jspd?criticReviewId=3781 |date=2007-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:FIFA Women's World Cup 2003 - USA vs Canada.jpg|left|thumb|275px|[[2003 FIFA Women's World Cup]]]]
Other critics have also noted the multiple generation gaps. Kevin Cahillane observes in the ''[[New York Times]]'' that, "this being 1978 (before [[Title IX]] turned a generation of girls from onlookers into athletes), her desire goes against the wishes of the coach, the principal, the other players and her heartbroken parents."&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; In another article for the ''New York Times,'' Jeannette Catsoulis further argues that, "[Gracie] is accustomed to having her abilities overlooked ... When tragedy strikes, and Grace channels her grief into a resolution to play on the all-male varsity team, even her best friend is horrified. As everyone knows, only lesbians play soccer."&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/movies/01grac.html?ex=1338350400&amp;en=23df6b0a612f84a8&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss Soccer Dreams and Family Tensions]&lt;/ref&gt;

The film closes with the following remarks: "Thanks to [[Title IX]] and brave girls like Gracie, there are over 5&amp;nbsp;million girls who play soccer in America. Since 1991 the [[United States women's national soccer team|U.S. Women's National team]] has won Soccer's World Championships two times." (FIFA Women's World Cup Champions 1991, 1999)

==Production==

===Development and casting===
[[File:LisaShueJI1.jpg|right|thumb|225px|[[Elisabeth Shue]] in August 2007.]]
The film is loosely based on life events concerning the Shue family. Former ''[[Melrose Place]]'' star [[Andrew Shue]], who developed the film, was one of its producers, and acted a supporting role in the film, initially conceived of it as a story about his late brother William, the oldest Shue sibling, who was the captain of the [[Columbia High School (New Jersey)|Columbia High School]] soccer team that won the [[New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association|New Jersey state championship]] in 1978; he had died in an accident in 1988.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; As Andrew developed the idea with his brother-in-law [[Davis Guggenheim]], the director of ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]],'' the storyline began to shift towards Guggenheim's wife, [[Elisabeth Shue]], Andrew's older sister. She became the model for Gracie, and William became the model for Johnny. As Andrew Shue noted in an interview:

{{quote|... It was going to be about my older brother, originally. It was really Davis, my sister's husband, who pointed out to me that my sister was the real underdog in our family. I didn't know the emotional turmoil of a girl in an all-boys family trying to get some credit for the fact that she had this courage to play with boys. She has gone from being a girl who was scared, to being this brave girl who could stand up and play with boys, and [went] into acting before any of us and inspired all of us in many ways. So I wanted to celebrate her and her journey.&lt;ref name="beliefnet.com"/&gt;}}

This refers to Elisabeth Shue's own decision in 1972, at the age of nine, to play soccer on an all-boys team, making her the first girl in the South Orange and Maplewood areas of [[New Jersey]] to do so.&lt;ref name="popmatters.com"&gt;[http://www.popmatters.com/pm/news/article/41996/based-on-a-real-story-gracie-is-a-shue-thing Based on a real story, 'Gracie' is a Shue thing]&lt;/ref&gt; Shue explained her reason for doing so in a 2007 interview. "There was no other choice back then," she pointed out to the interviewer. "There was no girls team to play on."&lt;ref name="popmatters.com"/&gt; Shue continued to play on the team until 1976, when she turned 13. Of her decision to leave the team, Shue stated, "the movie is really what would have happened if I hadn't quit [playing soccer]. I quit because of what people would think of me. The pressure from the boys. The awkward development of my body. I really, really regret it. I wish I'd been brave enough."&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;

Andrew, Elizabeth, their brother John (who was also a producer on the film), and Guggenheim then engaged in an extensive search to find the right actress for the role of fifteen-year-old Gracie; they promoted the search on the website ''findinggracie.com.''&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/*//findinggracie.com/ |date=* |title=archived versions from 2004-2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1044463,00.html Shue Business], an April 2005 article from the ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' website&lt;/ref&gt; The role eventually went to athlete-actress [[Carly Schroeder]]. Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat argue that Schroeder "puts in a stellar performance as the teenager who becomes a warrior when most of her peers are cheering from the sidelines."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiritualityandpractice.com/films/films.php?id=16912 Gracie: A film review]&lt;/ref&gt;

Filming took partial place at [[Columbia High School (New Jersey)|Columbia High School]], both the setting of the events of the film and the actual high school the Shue family members had attended.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbiasoccer.net/ Columbia High Soccer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110185835/http://www.columbiasoccer.net/ |date=2007-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Filming also took place in various locations in [[South Plainfield, New Jersey]].

Andrew Shue chose to honor his former Dartmouth and Columbia High School teammate Chris Colasanti by naming the story's coach after him.

==Reception==

===Reviews===
''[[At the Movies with Ebert &amp; Roeper]]'' gave ''Gracie'' "Two [[Thumbs signal|Thumbs up]]", stating, "You've seen it before, but you'll rarely see it better."&lt;ref&gt;[http://bventertainment.go.com/tv/buenavista/ebertandroeper/index2.html?sec=6&amp;subsec=Gracie Ebert and Roeper review]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gracie'' is a ''[[New York Times]] Critics' Pick.'' Times critic Jeannette Catsoulis described ''Gracie'' as "a familiar underdog story told with unusual sensitivity ... ''Gracie'' connects the adversity-drama dots – the beat-down, the bounce-back, the last-minute support from an unexpected quarter – with a subtle awareness of the shock waves of bereavement. Balancing the emotional complexity is Chris Manley's refreshingly unaffected cinematography; the drama of a free kick, like that of a good movie, is best viewed through a steady lens."&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/movies/01grac.html Soccer Dreams and Family Tensions]&lt;/ref&gt; Bill Zwecker, of the ''[[Chicago Sun Times|Chicago Sun-Times]],'' stated, "It's a sweet and uplifting film, and though quite predictable, gives us a family drama that showcases simple truths about overcoming seemingly impossible odds and leaves you with a warm and very satisfying feeling deep down. It's a solid, hopeful and inspiring story that reminds us of what we might call 'old-fashioned' values about perseverance and making your dreams come true. Old-fashioned? Not at all."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/movies/408618,WKP-News-gracie01.article 'Gracie' uplifting family fare]&lt;/ref&gt;

Owen Gleiberman of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' argued that "in 1978, a high school girl playing competitive soccer wasn't just novel – it was barely heard of. This amiable rouser, based on the experiences of Elisabeth Shue and her family, tries to convey how gutsy and role-smashing it is for ... Gracie to cleat her way onto an all-boys soccer team. So why is Gracie as processed as an [[after school special|after-school special]]? You miss the knockabout edge of ''[[Bend It Like Beckham]]'' – though the ending, in its [[Ivan Pavlov|Pavlovian]] sports-flick way, pumps you up."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20040676,00.html Review of ''Gracie'']&lt;/ref&gt; Scott Tobias of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' suggested that "though ''Gracie'' fashions Shue's story into ready-made inspirational formula, it's nonetheless vivid in its particulars, from the looks and sounds of late-'70s New Jersey to the portrait of a soccer-driven family reformed by loss."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avclub.com/content/node/62279 Review of ''Gracie''] from ''[[The A.V. Club]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Lael Loewenstein of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' stated that ''Gracie'' is "an earnest, well-acted, poignant drama that nevertheless runs afoul of [[List of sports clichés#Sports film clichés|sports movie clichés]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/reviews/cl-et-gracie1jun01,0,7598824.story Review of ''Gracie''] from the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hunting weapons''' are [[weapon]]s designed or used primarily for [[hunting]] [[game animal]]s for food or sport, as distinct from [[defensive weapon]]s or weapons used primarily in warfare.

==Characteristics==
Since [[human being]]s are lacking in the natural weapons possessed by other [[predator]]s, humans have a long history of making [[tool]]s to overcome this shortcoming. The evolution of hunting weapons shows an ever-increasing ability to extend the hunter's reach, while maintaining the ability to produce disabling or lethal wounds, allowing the hunter to capture the game.

The spear was in use for hunting as early as five million years ago in hominid and chimpanzee societies, and its usage may go back even further.&lt;ref&gt;Rick Weiss, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/22/AR2007022201007.html "Chimps Observed Making Their Own Weapons"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', February 22, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The spear gave the hunter the ability to kill large animals, at ranges as far as the hunter could throw the spear; the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[pilum]], for example, had a range of {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=off}}. Spear throwing devices such as the [[bâton de commandement]], [[Woomera (spear-thrower)|woomera]], and [[atlatl]] extended that range even further by giving the hunter leverage to throw the spear faster and farther. The atlatl allowed a skilled user to throw a dart up to {{convert|100|m|yd|abbr=off}}. Archaeological evidence of the atlatl has been found on all continents except for Antarctica. The atlatl was displaced starting in the late [[Paleolithic]] with the easier to make and use [[archery|bow and arrow]], which remains in common use today in both sporting and hunting. With the advent of accurate, reliable [[firearm]]s, firearms became the weapon of choice. Each new evolution of hunting weapons extended the range and accuracy; a skilled hunter, with suitable equipment and good conditions, can take game at ranges of over 1,000 meters (1&amp;nbsp;km).&lt;ref&gt;Lilja, Daniel. [https://web.archive.org/web/20060213104730/http://www.riflebarrels.com/articles/longrange_shooting/shooting_hunting.htm "Long Range Shooting &amp; Hunting"] article on long range hunting (archived link, February 13, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another hunting weapon, based on different principles than the spear, is the [[throwing stick]]. While at its simplest the throwing stick is just a heavy [[Club (weapon)|club]] thrown at the game, a well designed throwing stick uses the principles of an [[airfoil]] shape and [[gyroscope|gyroscopic stability]]; the oldest of these dates back 200,000 years to ancient Poland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/boomerang4.htm How Boomerangs Work], HowStuffWorks.com&lt;/ref&gt; The ''kylie'', for example, an Australian hunting [[boomerang]] in use into modern times, uses the bent shape and a symmetric airfoil cross section to provide stability and low drag for long, accurate throws.&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20050426222159/http://wings.avkids.com/Book/Sports/instructor/boomerang-01.html |title=Aerodynamics in Sports Equipment, Recreation and Machines |date=2005-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kylies do not return (a good thing, since they are large, heavy, and dangerous) but smaller, lighter versions, the classic boomerang, exhibit the classic circular path that made the boomerang famous. Boomerangs, of both the non-returning and returning variety, have been found in many ancient cultures, ranging from Egypt to North America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rangs.co.uk/boomhistory.htm Boomerang History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630052119/http://www.rangs.co.uk/boomhistory.htm |date=June 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other early weapons used for hunting include the [[Sling (weapon)|sling]], which allows small stones or metal balls to be thrown at much higher velocities than the arm alone, and the [[blowgun]]. The South American blowgun's [[curare]] tipped darts, intended to paralyze small game, is very similar in function to modern [[capture gun]]s, with the substitution of a [[barbiturate]] for the [[paralytic]] curare.

==Usage and regulations==
Hunting weapons are typically regulated by game category, area within the state, and time period. Regulations for big game hunting often specify a minimum [[caliber]] or [[muzzle energy]] for [[firearm]]s. The use of [[rifle]]s is often banned for safety reasons in areas with high [[population density]], limited [[Terrain|topographic relief]], or for hunting on bodies of water where the danger of ricochet exists. Specific seasons for [[bow (weapon)|bow]] hunting or muzzle-loading [[Black powder|black-powder]] guns are often established to limit competition with hunters using more effective firearms. The state of [[Oklahoma]], for example, has a three-and-a-half-month archery season, a 25-day muzzleloader season, and a 16-day modern gun season&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wildlifedepartment.com/seasons.htm 2007-2008 Oklahoma Hunting Seasons] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705065833/http://www.wildlifedepartment.com/seasons.htm |date=July 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Atlatl.png|thumb|Atlatl, one of the "newest" popular primitive hunting weapons]]
The most popular hunting weapons during antiquity were the bow and the spear.
&lt;ref name="blackmore"&gt;{{cite book |author=Blackmore, Howard L. |title=Hunting Weapons from the Middle Ages to the Twentieth Century |publisher=Dover Publications|page=1 |year=2000| ISBN=978-0-486-40961-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; During pre-history, prior to the invention of the bow, the most popular was arguably the [[atlatl]]; archaeological finds of atlatls have occurred on all continents except Antarctica. Today, however, the most popular primitive hunting weapons are muzzleloading rifles. {{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} Whatever the choice of arms, primitive hunting weapons are used during special primitive weapon hunting seasons in many parts of the world&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.georgiawildlife.com/content/displaycontent.asp?txtDocument=279&amp;txtPage=2 Georgia primitive hunting season] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929073011/https://www.georgiawildlife.com/content/displaycontent.asp?txtDocument=279&amp;txtPage=2 |date=2007-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atlatls, consisting of a weighted stick with a flexible spear or dart, are one example of primitive weapons that are commonly used today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casinocitytimes.com/news/article.cfm?contentID=165832 Atlatl]&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., the [[Pennsylvania]] Game Commission has given preliminary approval &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sungazette.com/articles.asp?articleID=2016 Pennsylvania atlatl regs] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311060652/http://www.sungazette.com/articles.asp?articleID=2016 |date=March 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for the legalization of the atlatl for hunting certain animals. The animals that would be allowed to atlatl hunters have yet to be determined, but attention is focused on [[deer]]. There are some who object, stating that the atlatl is rarely capable of a clean kill, resulting in undue suffering for the sport animal. As of 2007, only [[Alabama]] allowed the use of the atlatl for deer hunting, with a few other states allowing its use for rough fish (rather than food or sport species), as well as some game birds and non-game mammals.&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071122141035/http://sports.espn.go.com/outdoors/general/columns/story?columnist=absher_jr&amp;page=g_blog_Absher_JR_archive_thru-060424 |title=Alabama atlatl regs |date=2007-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Primitive hunting weapons are the only weapons permitted for some types of modern-day hunting. For example, the newly opened 2007 Florida Alligator Hunt specifically prohibits firearms due to the dangers of firing bullets around bodies of water, and recommends instead the use of a detachable-head harpoon for hunting alligators during the nighttime hours that hunting is permitted.&lt;ref name=gator&gt;[http://myfwc.com/gators/public/TO_manual_2007.pdf Alligator hunting] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524123203/http://myfwc.com/gators/public/TO_manual_2007.pdf |date=May 24, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Powerhead (firearm)|bang stick]], a specialized type of firearm, is then often used to sever the spinal cord of the alligator just to the rear of the head. This kills the alligator immediately upon its being taken, as required by regulatory laws governing the hunt.

==Firearms by type==
Modern cartridge firearms are generally broken down into classifications based on their characteristics. Due to the vast number of laws regulating firearms in different jurisdictions, legal definitions may vary widely from the technical definitions provided here.

===Rifles===
{{main|Rifle}}
Rifles are shoulder fired guns with [[rifling|rifled]] barrels, and provide the greatest accuracy and range of all hunting weapons. [[Centerfire]] rifles are generally used for killing big-[[game (food)|game]] species. [[Rimfire ammunition|Rimfire]] rifles, such as the [[.22 Long Rifle]], are used for killing small-game species.

===Shotguns===
{{main|Shotgun}}
[[File:Winchester Model 1912.JPG|right|thumb|300px|[[Winchester Model 1912]] 12-gauge hammerless pump-action shotgun]]
Shotguns were originally designed to fire multiple small projectiles in a single shot. This method is still used mainly for hunting small [[game (food)|game]], and, occasionally, for hunting deer with [[Shotgun shell|buckshot]], but modern shotguns can also be used for bigger game (deer, bear, etc.) when loaded with [[Slug (projectile)|slug]]s. Hunting shotguns are shoulder-fired weapons, and are generally smoothbores, but guns designed to fire slugs may have rifled barrels. Shotguns are used for short range shooting, and are less accurate than rifles, though the ability to fire multiple projectiles makes them ideal for small, fast moving targets. Additionally, the shorter effective range of shotguns, measured typically less than {{convert|100|yd|m}} when using shot or slugs, with a maximum slug travel range of a few hundred yards for missed shots, becomes a safety advantage when hunting in areas with high population densities relative to using rifles that may have a maximum bullet travel range of several miles for missed shots. The following are popular [[shotgun]] [[Firearm action|actions]] for hunting:

*[[Break-action|Break-barrel action]]
*[[Pump-action|Pump action]]
*[[Semi-automatic shotgun]]

===Handguns===
{{main|Handgun}}
Handguns are becoming increasingly popular for hunting. Intended to be fired with one or two hands, but lacking a shoulder support, handguns are more challenging to shoot accurately than a long gun (a rifle or shotgun). Hunting handguns differ from [[defensive weapon|defensive]] handguns in a number of ways; hunting handguns usually have longer barrels, better sights (often mounting [[telescopic sight]]s or [[red dot sight]]s), and, depending on the game, will fire a much more powerful cartridge. Rimfire hunting handguns can be of any action type, but centerfire hunting handguns are dominated by the single shot and revolver actions, such as the [[Thompson Center Arms]] Contender.

===Powerheads or bang sticks===
{{main|Powerhead (firearm)}}
A powerhead or bang stick is a device which fires a firearms cartridge or [[blank cartridge]] in contact with the target, and relies primarily on the [[muzzle flash|muzzle blast]] to kill the target. Powerheads are often attached to spears used for [[spear fishing]], or attached to a handle to make a bang stick, which is thrust (while still held) at the target. Bang sticks are often carried for [[defensive weapon|defense]] against [[shark]] attack, but are legally required for alligator hunting in some areas.&lt;ref name=gator /&gt;

==Firearms by action==
Firearms are often broken down further by the action type, which describes how the firearm loads and fires each cartridge.

===Single-shot firearms===
{{main|Single-shot}}
Single-shot firearms used for hunting generally fall into three categories:

*Falling-block action
*Break-barrel action
*Single-shot bolt action

Single-shot firearms when used for hunting have some advantages over other rifles: they are cheap, they are usually more accurate, and their silent action does not scare [[game (food)|game]]. On the other hand, their single-shot characteristic limit one's ability to make follow-up or repeated shots quickly, when the first round does not provide a clean kill or when multiples of game appear. Likewise, when hunting dangerous game, having only a single shot capability increases the danger for the hunter, and single-shot firearms are therefore rarely used for hunting dangerous game. Single-shot designs can be found in all classes of hunting firearms, including rifles, shotguns, and handguns.

===Multi-barreled firearms===
{{main|Combination gun}}
[[Rifle]]s and [[shotgun]]s containing multiple barrels are some of the oldest types of multi-shot firearms, and their use continues to this day. These guns are traditionally used for hunting fast-moving or dangerous game, as the simplicity of the design makes a rapid second shot quick and certain; double rifles are known as [[express rifle]]s or when combined shotgun with rifle, are known as [[combination gun|drilling]] or more accurately [[combination gun]] (the term "drilling" is German), the original "combination" guns manufactured in Europe had three bores overposed, but could be fashioned in more or less. The [[double-barreled shotgun]] is still the primary choice for most shotgun sporting events, as well as hunting of game birds. The [[double rifle]], due to the difficulty involved in regulating the two barrels to impact at the same point of aim, is prohibitively expensive; for example, a Purdey, Parker or Holland &amp; Holland double rifle sells between US$40,000 - 150,000.&lt;ref&gt;Blue Book of Gun Values, 13th Ed. S. P. Fjestad&lt;/ref&gt; Combination guns, containing two, three, or four barrels, most often a mix of rifle and shotgun barrels, are popular choices for hunting in Europe. A typical three barrel drilling mix of a [[Rimfire ammunition|rimfire]] rifle, a powerful [[centerfire]] rifle, and a shotgun barrel allows the taking of a very wide range of game with a single gun. Multi-barrel designs in hunting guns are generally restricted to rifles, shotguns, and combination guns.

===Revolvers===
{{main|Revolver}}
[[File:Anaconda-502.jpg|thumb|308px|left|.44 Magnum Colt Anaconda]]
Revolvers use multiple chambers and a single barrel to provide much of the reliability of a multi-barreled firearm without the weight and expense. Generally found only in handguns, the revolver is becoming increasingly popular for hunting ever larger game, as shown by recent developments such as the [[.44 Magnum]], arguably the first dedicated hunting handgun cartridge, and the new [[.500 S&amp;W Magnum]].

===Repeating action types===
Repeating actions provide an easy way for the user to load a new round of ammunition into the firearm, usually from a spring-loaded magazine. These may be manually operated, or powered by energy tapped from the firing of a cartridge.

*[[Bolt-action]] weapons are rugged, reliable, and typically the most accurate, due to the strong camming action that locks the bolt into the receiver. The disadvantage is that bolt actions require removing the firing hand from the trigger to operate the bolt, which requires more time between shots than other repeating actions.
*[[Lever-action]] guns represent the earliest successful repeating actions. Essentially unchanged for over a century, lever action rifles are faster to operate than a bolt action, though the traditional designs and tubular magazines used limit the pressures and bullet shapes that can be used. The use of lever action hunting rifles is deeply embedded in American culture.
*[[Pump-action]] weapons are faster to cycle than lever actions, but are not well suited for firing from a supported position. Most pump-action designs are found in shotguns, which are typically fired from a standing position where the movement of the arm to operate the action is not an issue.
*[[Semi-automatic rifle|Semi-automatic]] actions are similar in principle to [[machine gun]] actions, but only allow one shot per pull of the trigger. These actions provide the fastest operation, usually allowing a shot to be fired as fast as the shooter can pull the trigger. Since the action requires the energy created by the cartridge to operate the cyclic, there is less felt recoil, however, they may fail to cycle under extreme conditions.

==Air rifles and air pistols==
{{main|Air gun}}

Air rifles have long been used as hunting weapons, for well over 200 years. [[Lewis and Clark Expedition|Lewis &amp; Clark]], on their early journey through the Western United States, carried a repeating air rifle for use as a hunting weapon, it being considered more reliable than the flintlocks they also carried on their exploring journey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beemans.net/lewis-assault-rifle.htm Lewis and Clark air rifle]&lt;/ref&gt;

Air rifles are well suited for hunting small game such as [[squirrel]]s and [[rabbit]]s in commonly available powers. Such hunting is widely practiced in the United States and in the UK. Nonetheless, some states in the United States prohibit the use of air rifles for hunting regardless of the foot pound equivalent (FPE) of the projectile that is launched; for example, Florida prohibits the use of any air rifle for any hunting. On the other hand, in the UK, 12 FPE is the categorical limit for air rifles used for hunting. Above this [[muzzle energy]] rating, air rifles are considered to be firearms from a legal standpoint in the UK, and normal firearms regulations apply to these higher power air rifles.

Air pistols and rifles are also well suited for hunting vermin (e.g., rats).

Large game air rifles have experienced a resurgence in the last several decades, and are now capable of taking all game in North America, unlike the earlier [[Quackenbush rifle]]. Power levels of modern large game air rifles have greatly exceeded the hunting capabilities of the earlier [[Girandoni Air Rifle]]. Currently, large bore air rifles made by Mr. Dennis Quackenbush,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.quackenbushairguns.com&lt;/ref&gt; or those imported from Korea (i.e. Dragon Claw 50 caliber imported by Pyramydair &lt;ref&gt;http://www.pyramydair.com/&lt;/ref&gt;), are capable of generating about {{convert|200|ft.lbf|J|abbr=on}} of energy with large bullets ({{convert|200|gr}} or more), making them capable of taking large game.

==Animals==
{{main|Hunting dog|Falconry}}
Trained animals, most commonly dogs, are often used to track, flush, or retrieve game in various forms of hunting. In some sports, animals are also used as the weapons for bringing down the game. Examples of animals used in this way are some breeds of [[hound]] and [[terrier]], and [[birds of prey]].

'''''Jane Blalock v. Ladies Professional Golf Association''''' was an ongoing lawsuit that took place between 1972 and 1975, following a professional [[golf]] incident in 1972. A month after winning the notable [[Dinah Shore Colgate Winner's Circle]] in 1972, American golfer [[Jane Blalock]] was allegedly observed replacing her marker incorrectly at the [[Bluegrass Invitational]] during the [[1972 LPGA Tour]].&lt;ref name="droughtcorneliius"/&gt; Blalock was fined and suspended by the [[LPGA Tour]] executive board. The suspension led to a fair degree of press coverage, with Blalock filing an anti-trust countersuit in [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia]] shortly afterwards.&lt;ref name="notenoughpunish"/&gt;

In June 1973, federal judge [[Charles Allen Moye Jr.|Charles A. Moye Jr.]] ruled that "LGPA players cannot police their own members," and that Blalock's suspension "was ill-founded."&lt;ref name="antitrust"/&gt;  A court awarded Blalock damages the following year.&lt;ref name="damagesfurthertipled"/&gt; The LPGA subsequently announced plans to appeal.&lt;ref name="favordamages"/&gt; The ongoing lawsuit led to the LPGA searching for its first [[commissioner]], and after Ray Volpe was appointed to the role in July 1975,&lt;ref name="lpgavolpe"/&gt; a month later the LPGA dropped its appeal and settled all claims on the Blalock case.&lt;ref name="courtrustinfavor"/&gt;

==Background==
[[Jane Blalock]] was born in [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]] on September 19, 1945.&lt;ref name="all-timereocrdmade"/&gt; She began golfing at age 13, and won the New Hampshire Amateur five straight times beginning in 1965, plus the New England Amateur in 1968. Blalock attended [[Rollins College]] in [[Florida]], graduating in 1967 with a degree in [[history]]. Prior to her playing the LPGA Tour, Blalock worked as a high school history teacher.&lt;ref name="googlewinner"/&gt;

The first time Blalock played on the LPGA Tour was as an amateur at the 1964 [[Lady Carling Eastern Open]]. She finished T33.

Still an amateur, Blalock finished 5th at the 1969 [[Burdine's Invitational]].&lt;ref name="all-timereocrdmade"/&gt;

Blalock turned pro later in 1969 and went on to earn [[LPGA Tour Rookie of the Year]] honors.&lt;ref name="hofficialboublalock"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, Blalock notched her first professional victory at the [[Potamkin Cadillac Classic|Lady Carling Open]].&lt;ref name="jcaptures"/&gt; On April 16, 1972, Blalock won the inaugural version of the [[Dinah Shore Colgate Winner's Circle]],&lt;ref name="receiveswin"/&gt; an event which would later be considered a [[women's major golf championships|women's major golf championship]]. One month later she won the [[Suzuki Golf Internationale]], beating [[Kathy Whitworth]].&lt;ref name="takessuzuku"/&gt;

==History of the conflict==
===Disqualification (1972)===
{{See also|1972 LPGA Tour}}
After reaching the status of "top money winner on this year's [LPGA] tour," Blalock was competing in the [[Bluegrass Invitational]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]] by mid May 1972. After the second round the LPGA executive board called Blalock in to tell her she was disqualified from the tournament, contending that she signed an incorrect scorecard and also levying a $500 fine.&lt;ref name="ddmiitedguit"/&gt; Although Blalock's scorecards had been signed and attested by fellow competitors, Tourney director Gene Mcauliff stated that Blalock "did not mark her ball properly on the 17th green and then failed to take a two-stroke penalty as required for that infraction."&lt;ref name="droughtcorneliius"/&gt;

All five members of the executive committee, Linda Craft, [[Sharon Miller]], [[Judy Rankin]], Cynthia Sullivan, and Penny Zavichas, were themselves active players.&lt;ref name="didntmakeit"/&gt; After Blalock's initial interaction with the committee at the Bluegrass Invitational, 27 LPGA players signed an [[affidavit]] demanding "that more severe action be taken against Jane Blalock,"&lt;ref name="refuseback"/&gt; specifically arguing that probation, a fine, and disqualification from the Bluegrass tournament were not enough punishment.&lt;ref name="notenoughpunish"/&gt;

===Hearings and suspension (1972)===

|style="text-align: left;"|"[The LPGA committee] told Blalock she had been observed incorrectly marking her ball on several occasions. Blalock had never before been accused of violating the rules. Despite denying the charges, she was disqualified from the tournament. Before her next event, on the advice of a friend, Blalock apologized, saying, 'If all these things you say are true, I guess I've dug my own grave and I'll just have to live with it.' LPGA president [Cynthia Sullivan] interpreted Blalock's comments as an admission of guilt. When that view was reported to the players, 29 of them signed a petition calling for the LPGA to suspend Blalock for the rest of the '72 season, which it did a few days later."

On May 20, 1972&lt;ref name="antitrust"/&gt; the LPGA executive board suspended Blalock for one year "for actions inconsistent with the code of ethics of the organization."&lt;ref name="suspensionbl"/&gt; The suspension came shortly after the announcement that Blalock wouldn't be allowed to compete in the [[Potamkin Cadillac Classic|Lady Carling Open]]. The tour also put a hold on her money earnings from the tour, at the time around $50,000.&lt;ref name="concentrahard"/&gt;

In defending their reasons for the suspension, the board stated in a press release that "the action was taken after Miss Blalock met with the executive committee on three occasions in the last 10 days. She admitted actions on the golf course which are contrary to the rules of the game."&lt;ref name="suspensionbl"/&gt; According to ''Sports Illustrated,'' the board also claimed that Blalock had "been under suspicion for over a year, that there [had] been repeated violations, that witnesses in the gallery at Louisville had observed her replacing the ball to the side of her marker on the green&lt;ref name="courtrustinfavor72"/&gt; and that Janie tearfully admitted to her guilt. Miss Blalock was denying everything."&lt;ref name="ddmiitedguit"/&gt; LPGA executive director Bud Erickson also stated that he had requested Blalock to feign a back injury in an effort to avoid bad publicity, but she refused.&lt;ref name="refuseback"/&gt;

===Initial anti-trust lawsuit (1972)===
On June 1, 1972, Blalock filed a $5 million [[United States antitrust law|anti-trust]] [[countersuit]] against the LPGA's suspension&lt;ref name="suitresolved"/&gt; on advice of her attorneys,&lt;ref name="suspensionbl"/&gt; with the intent of "[leaving] it to the court whether she had been suspended wrongly."&lt;ref name="ddmiitedguit"/&gt; Blalock's lawyers motioned for her be allowed to continue playing while the suit was resolved.&lt;ref name="suitresolved"/&gt; As part of their argument, Blalock's lawyers denied she had ever admitted guilt to the LPGA,&lt;ref name="notenoughpunish"/&gt; and that the described admissions had been a misinterpretation of her words.&lt;ref name="didntmakeit"/&gt; Furthermore, using the sequence of events, attorney Eugene Partain "alleged that the suspension and petitions were likely the result of other players attempting to remove a significant competitor, and that the act of suspending [Blalock] from playing in any significant tournaments was a violation of federal antitrust laws by the LPGA."&lt;ref name="notenoughpunish"/&gt;

Around June 19, Blalock met with the LGPA in [[U.S. District Court]] in [[Atlanta]] over the lawsuit.&lt;ref name="ddmiitedguit"/&gt; Later that month U.S. District Court Judge [[Charles Allen Moye Jr.|Charles A. Moye Jr.]] granted the motion for Blalock to continue competing in the LPGA Tour until the lawsuit was resolved,&lt;ref name="motiongranted"/&gt; in effect creating a temporary [[restraining order]] against the suspension. Moye also ruled that any tour money Blalock earned during the case would be placed in a court trust. The LPGA reacted to Moye's rulings by announcing they would file an appeal suit.&lt;ref name="courtrustinfavor72"/&gt;

===Colleagues' initial reactions (1972)===
News of the suspension and alleged rules violation drew significant press coverage, as well as mixed reactions from Blalock's colleagues. Though he said he'd never seen her move a ball against the rules himself, her former instructor [[Bob Toski]] stated that "She has a compulsion to win. I think she needs psychiatric help" and "the other players tell me this has been going on for a while." In contrast, Blalock's [[caddie]] from the Suzuki tournament contacted her with an offer to testify in her support.&lt;ref name="ddmiitedguit"/&gt; Men's professional golfer [[Dave Hill (golfer)|Dave Hill]], who himself filed an antitrust suit in 1971 against the [[PGA Tour]],&lt;ref name="davehilef"/&gt; sent Blalock a note of encouragement. In his golf memoir ''Teed Off'', published in 1977, Hill wrote that he didn't know how Blalock continued to play well under the pressure she was enduring. The fact that Blalock did play well made Hill think she was innocent unless she was a victim of some illness.&lt;ref name="illnessshe"/&gt;

Golfer [[Sandra Palmer]] had also publicly defended Blalock as of July 8, 1972, after she and Blalock tied for lead at the [[George Washington Golf Classic]]. Stated Palmer to the press, "I've never seen her do anything [illegal], nor do I think probably that very many of the players have. I think supposedly that out of all these players who accused, only one or two have played with her." Palmer explained she didn't understand why bystanders hadn't reported the alleged infractions when they occurred, also pointing out that other players had always signed Blalock's scorecards without reporting any incidents. Stated Palmer, "if you see an infraction of the rules... you don't wait until three years later to report something. Once you've signed that card, you're as guilty as the person who committed the violation."&lt;ref name="vilationcard"/&gt;

===Probation of Sandra Palmer (1972)===
The ''[[Sarasota Journal]]'' reported on June 28, 1972 that [[Sandra Palmer]] had been "warned" by the LPGA over her statements of support for Blalock, with the LPGA explaining to Palmer that "you're entitled to your own opinion, but when it hurts our members, we feel you owe the organization an apology."&lt;ref name="statmentsdrama"/&gt; [[Bud Erickson]], executive director of the LPGA, later clarified that Palmer was also ordered "not to make any further statements of support for Miss Blalock."&lt;ref name="nosupportstatement"/&gt; The warning occurred as the tour arrived at the [[Potamkin Cadillac Classic|Lady Pepsi Golf Tournament]], where Blalock had previously won two championships.&lt;ref name="statmentsdrama"/&gt; On August 2, 1972, Palmer was put on one year's probation by the LPGA executive committee for voicing her support of Blalock.&lt;ref name="nosupportstatement"/&gt; Blalock went on to win two more times in 1972, at the [[Dallas Civitan Open]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1917&amp;dat=19720911&amp;id=2XchAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pIkFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4553,2391280&amp;hl=en Jane Blalock wins Dallas golf playoff]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Lady Errol Classic]].&lt;ref name="ladyreerolclassic"/&gt;

===Rulings and settlements (1973–75)===
{{See also|1975 LPGA Tour#LPGA Tour settles Jane Blalock lawsuit}}
After filing the original anti-trust suit, Blalock amended the suit to include only damages from not being able to compete in the Lady Carling Tournmanent in 1972 for $4,500.&lt;ref name="favordamages"/&gt;
{|class="toccolours" style="float: right; margin-left: 2em; margin-right: 0em; font-size: 90%; background:offwhite; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;" cellspacing="5"
|style="text-align: left;"|"In [the early 1970s] the [[LPGA]] was run by the players themselves. There was no office for the organization and no nonplaying director of the LPGA. Blalock, who denied she ever cheated and said she was the victim of older, jealous players as she began to make a mark on the tour, sued in [[United States federal courts|Federal Court]] in [[Atlanta]] to retain her playing rights and won. The court declared that players had no right to deprive a fellow competitor from an equal chance at the prize money they all were trying to earn."
|-
|style="text-align: left;"|— Gordon White for ''[[The New York Times]]'' (1987)&lt;ref name="retirementnyt"/&gt;
|}
In June 1973, Judge Charles Moye Jr. ruled that "LGPA players cannot police their own members." The ruling declared that Blalock's suspension "was ill-founded," with all remaining litigation to be focused on damages.&lt;ref name="antitrust"/&gt; In September 1973, ''[[The Telegraph (Nashua)|The Telegraph]]'' reported that as a result of the court ruling in Blalock's favor, the LPGA and their new president [[Carol Mann]] were looking to appoint a [[commissioner]] to "[enable] the association to penalize, suspend and fine members who violate rules and regulations."&lt;ref name="commissionera"/&gt;

In August 1974, a court awarded Blalock the full $4,500 she had asked for in damages,&lt;ref name="damagesfurthertipled"/&gt; with the LPGA again announcing plans to appeal.&lt;ref name="favordamages"/&gt; Afterwards, in March 1975 Judge Charles Moye again ruled in Blalock's favor, awarding her $13,500 in damages and ordering the LPGA to pay her legal fees of $95,303. The LPGA again announced it would appeal the ruling in its entirety.&lt;ref name="damagesfurthertipled"/&gt; Ray Volpe was appointed the first LPGA Commissioner on July 8, 1975,&lt;ref name="lpgavolpe"/&gt; and a month later the LPGA announced it had dropped its appeal and settled "all claims and counter claims growing from a dispute between it and golfer Jane Blalock."&lt;ref name="courtrustinfavor"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
Blalock refused to condemn her critics, including her former mentor Bob Toski, after her lawsuit was settled. She said to a reporter in 1978 "I should not judge others as they have judged me. Life is too short and there is too much sadness. So I can't clutter my mind with all that other stuff. It makes it hard to concentrate."&lt;ref name="concentrahard"/&gt; Bob Toski left the [[Senior PGA Tour]] in 1986 after he became involved in a controversy over how he was marking his ball.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=H7VhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=sc4FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1779,6138908&amp;dq=bob+toski+seniors+tour&amp;hl=en Toski withdraws from Senior Tour]&lt;/ref&gt; Toski returned in April 1986&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=FPcjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=bdsFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3915,2451335&amp;dq=toski+golf&amp;hl=en 28 Teams To Compete In Legends of Golf]&lt;/ref&gt; and played several more years on the Tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pgatour.com/players/player.02208.bob-toski.html |title=Bob Toski – Results – Career |publisher=PGA Tour |access-date=January 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blalock continued playing on the LPGA Tour through 1987. When she was through playing, Blalock had 27 Tour wins to her credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=2008 LPGA Media Guide|publisher=[[LPGA Tour]] |year=1977 |pages=52 and 363}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the first female golfer to earn over $100,000 in four consecutive years&lt;ref name="retirementnyt"/&gt; and the seventh overall to reach the one million dollar mark in career earnings.&lt;ref name="earningsmillion"/&gt; Between 1969 and 1980, Blalock made the cut in 299 consecutive tournaments, an all-time LPGA Tour record.&lt;ref name="all-timereocrdmade"/&gt;

In 1976, Blalock testified for the LPGA Tour in a suit against a sponsor trying to start a Women's [[Masters Tournament]].&lt;ref name="againstsponsor"/&gt; Blalock wrote a column  for the ''[[Miami Herald]]'' in 1981 complaining about the association's overuse of sex appeal in promoting the tour.&lt;ref name="sexappealnotneeded"/&gt;

With 27 LPGA Tour wins, Blalock almost qualified for the [[World Golf Hall of Fame]] under the standards in use as of 2011. However, she never won a major championship in her career nor was she ever LPGA Player of the Year or winner of the LPGA Vare Trophy.&lt;ref name="worldgolffame"/&gt; Blalock would have to be voted in by the Veterans Committee.&lt;ref name="didntmakeit"/&gt;  As of 2018, all eligible [[List of golfers with most LPGA Tour wins|golfers with 20 or more wins on the LPGA Tour]] are in the World Golf Hall of Fame except Blalock. Several golfers who primarily played the LPGA Tour, [[Hollis Stacy]] who was inducted in 2012,&lt;ref name="hollisstacy2012"&gt;[http://espn.go.com/golf/story/_/id/7247989/hollis-stacy-selected-world-golf-hall-fame Hollis Stacy selected for Hall of Fame]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Judy Rankin]] and [[Donna Caponi]] have fewer career wins than Blalock but have been selected by the Veterans Committee. Blalock said in 2001 "It's almost a relief that I don't qualify. What if every year my name came up and every year I didn't make it? I'd be thinking, 'is what happened the reason?'"&lt;ref name="didntmakeit"/&gt;

In July 2014, she was voted into the [[Legends Tour|Legends Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref name="qlpgahome"/&gt;

A '''nasal strip''', '''external nasal dilator strip''' or '''nasal dilator strip''' is a type of adhesive bandage with embedded plastic ribs or splints that is applied across the [[Nasal bone|bridge of the nose]] and sides of the [[nostrils]], to assist in keeping the airway open. They are believed to make breathing easier and for that reason are used during athletic exertion and as an aid to reduce congestion or to prevent snoring.&lt;ref name=Bhardwaj&gt;{{cite web|author=Bhardwaj, Munish |url=http://www.disabled-world.com/artman/publish/nasal-strips.shtml |title=Nasal Strips |publisher=Disabled-world.com |date=2008-08-08 |accessdate=2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Various studies have not indicated that they have a performance-enhancing effect.&lt;ref name=OKroy&gt;{{cite journal|author=O'Kroy, J.A. |title=Oxygen uptake and ventilatory effects of an external nasal dilator during ergometry |work=Med Sci Sports Exerc |date=August 2000 |volume=32 |issue=8 |pmid=10949017 |pages=1491-5 |doi=
10.1097/00005768-200008000-00019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are also used by [[race horse]] [[horse trainer|trainers]] on horses for similar reasons;  they are thought to reduce airway resistance and lower the risk of [[exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage]] (EIPH), plus reduce fatigue and aid post-race recovery.&lt;ref name=Nuzzo24May&gt;{{cite web|last=Nuzzo|first=Regina |url=http://espn.go.com/horse-racing/story/_/id/10973676/science-california-chrome-nasal-strip-espn-magazine|title=Straight from the horse's nose |publisher=ESPN|accessdate=2014-05-27|date=2014-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human use==
[[File:Andy Studebaker.JPG|thumb|A [[gridiron football]] player wearing a nasal strip]]

In humans, the [[Anatomy of the human nose#External|nasal valve]] is the narrowest part of the nasal aperture and when exercising, this area is subjected to [[Pressure#Negative pressures|negative pressure]] and becomes smaller.&lt;ref name=Peltonin&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rougier.ca/newenglish/pdf/studies/Nozovent16.pdf |title=Effects of the nasal strip and dilator on nasal breathing – a study with healthy subjects |author=Peltonen, Lauri I., et. al. |work=Rhinology |volume=42 |year=2004 |pages=122–125 |format=pdf |accessdate=2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nasal strips adhere to the skin, holding open the [[anterior nasal aperture]] and prevent it from collapsing.&lt;ref name=stanford&gt;{{cite web |url=http://med.stanford.edu/ohns/sleepsurgery/nasal_surgery.html |title=Stanford Sleep Surgery – Otolaryngology |publisher=Stanford University School of Medicine |date=2008-06-20 |accessdate=2014-05-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316131904/http://med.stanford.edu/ohns/sleepsurgery/nasal_surgery.html |archivedate=2015-03-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When properly applied, they lift and widen the space in the nasal passage.  They are a drug-free method to maintain airway flow and are available as an [[over the counter]] product.&lt;ref name=Bhardwaj/&gt; They have no reported side effects other than possible skin irritation from the adhesive.&lt;ref name=Peltonin/&gt;

Studies indicate that they are useful in increasing nasal cavity volume in the front three centimeters of the human nose, and for that purpose could be an alternative to [[Nasal spray|decongestive nose spray]]s, but nasal strips are not particularly helpful for congestion in the [[posterior nasal apertures]].&lt;ref name=Hoyvoll&gt;{{cite journal|author=Høyvoll, L.R., et. al. |title=Effects of an external nasal dilator strip (ENDS) compared to xylometazolin nasal spray |work=Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol |date=November 2007 |volume=264 |issue=11 |pmid=17530269 |doi=10.1007/s00405-007-0345-6 |pages=1289-94}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They also have been shown to reduce snoring loudness and improve quality of sleep.  Subjects wearing the strips in tests indicated that they believed that the strips helped them breathe more easily, and they are of particular interest to those human athletes who have to wear a [[mouthguard]] and need to be able to breathe more through their nostrils than their mouths.  Studies have not necessarily demonstrated that athletic performance is increased, but people wearing them seem to have far less [[dyspnea]] or shortness of breath while exercising.&lt;ref name=overend&gt;{{cite journal|author=Overend, Tom, et. al. |title=External Nasal Dilator Strips Do Not Affect Treadmill Performance in Subjects Wearing Mouthguards |work=Journal of Athletic Training |date=Jan–Mar 2000 |pmc=1323440 |pmid=16558610 |volume=35 |pages=60-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equine use==
[[File:CC nasal strip.jpg|thumb|right|Equine nasal strip worn by California Chrome]]
In horses, they are viewed as helpful because the animals cannot breathe through their mouths, only through their nostrils.  As with humans, the equine design helps keep the nasal valve from collapsing due to the negative pressure created by physical exertion.&lt;ref name=Nuzzo24May/&gt;  However, their primary benefit is to prevent bleeding in the lungs (EIPH), not to directly enhance performance.  The equine version was invented by two veterinarians, James Chiapetta and Edward Blach.  In the 1990s, they were inspired by the human product to attempt to create a similar device for horses.  They had observed horses on [[treadmill]]s and saw that, under exertion, the equine nasal passage also narrowed due to the tissue being sucked in. They worked out a licensing agreement with CNS, the company that manufactured the human "Breathe Right" brand of nasal strips in 1997 (now owned by [[GlaxoSmithKline]]) where the company manufactured the equine form of the nasal strip, and paid royalties to Chiapetta and Blach.  The equine version was first used publicly at the 1999 [[Breeders' Cup]] horse races and the [[2000 Summer Olympics]].  In 2001, they parted ways with CNS and formed their own company, Flair, and in 2008, Chiapetta bought out Blach.&lt;!--this cite to all of paragraph following previous footnote--&gt;&lt;ref name=Kavilanz5June&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kavilanz|first1=Parija|title=Meet the maker of California Chrome's nasal strip|url=http://money.cnn.com/2014/06/05/smallbusiness/california-chrome-nasal-strip/|publisher=CNN Money|accessdate=2014-06-05|date=2014-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''Open''' in [[sports]] [[terminology]] refers to a sporting event or game tournament that is open to contestants regardless of their [[professional]] or [[amateur]] status, age, ability, [[gender]], [[sex]], or other categorization. In many sports, preliminary qualifying events, open to all entrants, are held to successively reduce the field to a manageable number for participation in a final championship event, which itself may involve elimination rounds (tournaments).

The term 'Open' may not be absolute. For example, in the [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]] in golf, entrants at qualifying events must have a [[United States Golf Association|USGA]] official handicap of 1.4 or less. Other minimum performance standards or eligibility criteria may apply in other sports.

Opens are usually found in [[golf]], [[tennis]], [[bowling]], [[badminton]], [[quizbowl]], [[fighting game]]s, [[snooker]], [[darts]], [[volleyball]], [[ultimate (sport)|ultimate]], [[squash (sport)|squash]] and [[chess]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3257">'''Proposition 48''' is LIT regulation that stipulates minimum [[high school]] [[Grade (education)|grades]] and [[standardized test]] scores that [[Student athlete|student-athletes]] must meet in order to participate in college athletic competition.

The NCAA enacted Proposition 48 in 1986.&lt;ref name="HistoryOfProp48"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.fastweb.com/student-life/articles/347-ncaa-s-clearinghouse-rules-who-s-looking-out-for-the-student-athlete|title = NCAA's Clearinghouse Rules - Who's Looking Out for the Student-Athlete?| author = Richard Pound| date = 21 April 2009 | accessdate = 1 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2010, the regulation is as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Before a high school student can be eligible to play [[Division I sports]], he or she must meet academic requirements in high school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Seamless Eligibility Model|url=http://www.jsutigers.com/pdf9/2577007.pdf?DB_OEM_ID=29000|work=Tiger Patrol Compliance Newsletter|publisher=Jackson State University|accessdate=7 February 2014|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those standards include:

* The successful completion of 16 core courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Katz|first=Deborah|title=NCAA Considers New Standards for Initial and Continuing Eligibility|url=http://www4.aacrao.org/semsource/sem/indexe992.html?fa=view&amp;id=2349|work=Strategic Enrollment Management|publisher=American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers.|accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* A sliding-scale combination of grades in high school core courses and standardized-test scores. For example, if a student-athlete earns a 3.0 grade-point average in core courses, that individual must score at least 620 on the [[SAT]] or a sumscore of 52 on the [[ACT (test)|ACT]]. As the [[GPA]] increases, the required test score decreases, and vice versa.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==New Regulations==
Beginning August 1, 2016, NCAA Division I will require 10 core courses to be completed prior to the seventh semester (seven of the 10 must be a combination of English, math or natural or [[physical science]] that meet the [[distribution requirements]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Divisions I and II Initial-Eligibility Requirements|url=http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/eligigfdghdhضضصنننشششbility_center/Quick_Reference_Sheet.pdf|work=NCAA ELIGIBILITY CENTER QUICK REFERENCE GUIDE|publisher=NCAA|accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These 10 courses become "locked in" at the start of the seventh semester and cannot be retaken for grade improvement.

Beginning August 1, 2016, it will be possible for a Division I college-bound student-athlete to still receive athletics aid and the ability to practice with the team if he or she fails to meet the 10 course requirement, but would not be able to compete.

{{Refimprove|date=September 2014}}
'''Pro&amp;ndash;am''' (or '''pro/am''', '''pro am''', '''ProAm'''; a contraction of '''professional&amp;ndash;amateur''') refers to an activity, for example a sporting event where both [[Professional sports|professional]] career athletes and [[Amateur sports|amateurs compete]]. It could also refer to a collaboration between professionals and amateurs in a scientific discipline such as [[astronomy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Explained in 60 Seconds: Pro-Am|url=http://www.capjournal.org/issues/10/10_04.php|work=CAPjournal|publisher=[[International Astronomical Union]] Communicating Astronomy with the Public|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
In reference to individuals, the term also has another meaning: it implies someone that is intermediate, indeterminate or fluctuating between amateur and professional status, an idea more related to the similar socio-economic term "[[amateur professionalism]]".  A common synonym for this version of pro&amp;ndash;am is '''[[semi-professional]]''' ('''semi-pro'''). Thus has the term pro-am long had various meanings and significances, depending upon the sport in question. Those who play at a highly competitive and strongly skilled level, but are not paid, are often called pro&amp;ndash;ams. The term is also applied to competitors who do get paid in some events (e.g., tournaments with a cash prize) but who do not make a full-time living at the activity. In sports with a highly regulated system of professional qualifications and limitations, it may be applied to competitors whose careers move between professional and amateur status with their performance in any given season or string of seasons.

As an adjective, the term may also refer to an open contest or series of contests (e.g., "pro&amp;ndash;am tournament", "pro&amp;ndash;am tour") in which professionals and amateurs compete without distinction; those limited to "professional&amp;ndash;amateur" players and barring full-time pros; or those of a semi-professional or minor league level, short of the top competitive ranks in the sport.

Pro–am competition is especially common in [[golf]],{{Clarify|date=January 2010|reason=Elaborate. Much earlier versions of this asserted this was a golf term, but provided no explanation, example or source.}} and in [[track and field]]. [[Cue sports]] is another field in which pro&amp;ndash;am play is common; an example in the open, mixed-play sense is the [[International Pool Tour]] in [[eight-ball]]. And in [[snooker]], the [[International Open Series]] was a no-pros tour and a proving ground for amateurs aspiring to official pro qualification. [[Minor League Baseball]], and its conceptual equivalents in other sports such as the [[American Hockey League|AHL]] in North American [[ice hockey]] and [[Conference National]] play in [[English football league system|English football]], can also been seen as a form of well-organized pro&amp;ndash;am play in the semi-professional sense. There are also a few pro-am [[tennis]] events, such as the annual [[Necker Cup]] organized by [[Richard Branson]], where tennis pros are invited to compete against amateur enthusiasts.

In [[dance sport]], pro–am provides an opportunity for an amateur to take part in competitions with a professional partner. In this case, the teacher is usually also the dance partner. All of the most relevant international dance sport associations, including the [[World Dance Council]], [[World DanceSport Federation]], and [[International Dance Sport Association]], offer pro–am competitions as parts of their international events. The world's oldest dance competition, the [[Blackpool Dance Festival]], featured its first pro–am event in 2014. Chains of franchised pro–am studios, like the Arthur Murray and Fred Astaire studios, are found nationwide in the United States. Pro–am dance sport has also started to break ground in Europe, with studios such as Agens Pro–am (Germany), and ProAm-Tanzen (Austria).

'''Rule 21''' of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] (GAA) was a rule in force from 1897 to 2001 which banned members of the British [[security forces]] from membership of the GAA and thus from playing [[Gaelic games]]. The affected organisations included the [[British Armed Forces]] and the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC), and prior to [[Partition of Ireland|partition]] the [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] (RIC) and [[Dublin Metropolitan Police]]. As well as the RUC in [[Northern Ireland]], it also applied to [[UK police|police forces in Great Britain]], which affected [[London GAA]] and the other [[British GAA]] affiliates. Rule 21 stated:&lt;ref name="ind26068246"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ind29925280"/&gt;
:Members of the British armed forces or police shall not be eligible for membership of the Association.
:A member of the Association participating in dances, or similar entertainment, promoted by or under the patronage of such bodies, shall incur suspension of at least three months.
The rule was abolished after the establishment of the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] (PSNI) as part of the [[Northern Ireland peace process]].

==Origin==
Rule 21 was introduced in 1897 and reflected the rise of "advanced nationalism", with the GAA and other [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalist]] organisations founded in the [[Gaelic revival]] becoming more politicised and [[separatism|separatist]] in the build-up to the [[Irish revolutionary period|revolutionary period]].&lt;ref name="irishecho2011"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://irishecho.com/2011/02/gaa-delegates-vote-to-allow-cops-soldiers-3/|title=GAA delegates vote to allow cops, soldiers|last=Bushe|first=Andrew|date=16 February 2011|work=[[Irish Echo]]|accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="crokepark"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.crokepark.ie/gaa-museum/gaa-archive/gaa-museum-irish-times-articles/the-removal-of-douglas-hyde-as-patron-of-the-assoc|title=Articles on the history of the GAA &gt; The Removal of Douglas Hyde as Patron of the Association, 1938|work=Library &amp; Archive|publisher=[[GAA Museum]]|accessdate=25 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905172855/http://www.crokepark.ie/gaa-museum/gaa-archive/gaa-museum-irish-times-articles/the-removal-of-douglas-hyde-as-patron-of-the-assoc|archivedate=5 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was intended to allay fears that RIC members were joining GAA clubs to spy on members' political activities.&lt;ref name="irishecho2011"/&gt; It was overshadowed by the introduction in 1901 of [[Rule 27]], commonly called "The Ban", which prohibited GAA members from playing "foreign games" like [[soccer]] and [[rugby union]].&lt;ref name="crokepark" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sweeney2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nauright2012"/&gt; In 1938 [[Douglas Hyde]], recently inaugurated as first [[President of Ireland]], was removed as Patron of the GAA after attending an [[Ireland national football team (FAI) results|Irish soccer international]].&lt;ref name="crokepark" /&gt; After Rule 27 was abolished in 1971, it was Rule 21 and [[Rule 42]], which prohibited foreign games being played at GAA grounds, which were the focus of debate.&lt;ref name="Sweeney2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sweeney|first=Eamonn|title=O'Brien Pocket History of Gaelic Sport|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KWWNAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT11|accessdate=25 August 2015|date=2012-10-04|publisher=O'Brien Press|isbn=9781847175212|pages=11–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crokepark.ie/getmedia/7ce8a2b2-5059-47c9-9182-eaaf4ebd2163/senior-winner-shane-finegan.pdf |title=The role played by Tom Woulfe in the campaign (1959–1971) to remove the Ban on Foreign Games (Rule 27) from the rulebook of the GAA |last=Finegan |first=Shane |date=27 May 2011 |work=Winners of Secondary School Essay Competition |publisher=GAA |accessdate=25 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923211343/http://www.crokepark.ie/getmedia/7ce8a2b2-5059-47c9-9182-eaaf4ebd2163/Senior-Winner-Shane-Finegan.pdf |archivedate=23 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Northern Ireland==
After the 1922 creation of the [[Irish Free State]], Rule 21 continued to apply in Northern Ireland. Its strongest supporters were [[Physical force Irish republicanism|physical force republican]]s, and during [[the Troubles]] the GAA was suspected by many [[Irish unionism|unionists]] of collusion with the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]] and other paramilitaries.&lt;ref name="cronin1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nauright2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nauright|first=John|title=Sports around the World: History, Culture, and Practice|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=mYBtMajLAaAC&amp;pg=RA1-PA91|accessdate=25 August 2015|date=2012-04-06|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781598843019|pages=91–92|chapter=Gaelic Athletic Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some advocates of Rule 21 were opposed to any engagement with  "[[Crown forces]]", others linked it to alleged targeting by the security forces of the GAA, in particular the occupation of part of [[Crossmaglen Rangers GAC|Crossmaglen Rangers]]' grounds by a British Army base, which disrupted matches and other events there.&lt;ref name="Hassan2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hassan|first=D.|year=2005|title=The Gaelic Athletic Association, Rule 21, and Police Reform in Northern Ireland|journal=Journal of Sport &amp; Social Issues|volume=29|issue=1|pages=60–78|issn=0193-7235|doi=10.1177/0193723504268731}}&lt;/ref&gt; One player affected by the ban was  [[Brian McCargo]] from [[Ardoyne]], who played for [[Antrim GAA|Antrim county team]] before being obliged to quit in 1969 after joining the RUC [[Reserve Police Officers|Reserve]], during a period after the abolition of the [[B Specials]] when some Catholic community leaders were encouraging Catholics to join the revised force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1634688.stm|title='No regrets as a Catholic in the RUC' |date=21 December 2001 |work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sean McNulty from [[Warrenpoint]] won an [[All-Ireland Minor Football Championship|All-Ireland minor]] medal in 1977 but joined the RUC in 1982.&lt;ref name="it337706"/&gt; The [[Sports Council for Northern Ireland]] and Northern Ireland [[Department of Education (Northern Ireland)|Department of Education]] made funding grants to GAA bodies while Rule 21 was in force, but at a lower level than would otherwise have been the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/csc/reports/sugdenharvie/sugdenharvie95-1.htm|title=Sport and Community Relations in Northern Ireland|last=Sugden|first=John |author2=Scott Harvie|year=1995|publisher=CAIN|pages=1.5.2 – Gaelic Sport|quote=Official funding for the GAA has been forthcoming through the Department of Education for Northern Ireland (DENI) and the Sports Council for Northern Ireland but has been limited by the continued existence of Rule 21 which excludes members of Northern Ireland’s security forces from joining.(24) This rule means that Gaelic organisations are treated by the government as clubs with restricted membership. As such they are only entitled to between 50% and 33.5% grant aid towards the cost of facilities development.|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abolition==
During the [[Northern Ireland peace process]], abolishing Rule 21 was advocated by unionists, political leaders in the [[Republic of Ireland|Republic]], and the Independent Commission on Policing in Northern Ireland, whose report led to the replacement of the RUC by the PSNI.&lt;ref name="cronin1999"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Jouvert: A Journal of Postcolonial Studies |publisher=College of the Humanities and Social Sciences |location=North Carolina State University |volume=4 |issue=1: Ireland 2000 |url=http://english.chass.ncsu.edu/jouvert/v4i1/cron.htm|title=Ignoring Postcolonialism: The Gaelic Athletic Association and the Language of Colony |last=Cronin |first=Mike |date=Fall 1999|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/police/patten/chapter15.pdf#page=1 |title=Recruitment |author=Independent Commission On Policing For Northern Ireland |format=PDF |date=9 September 1999 |work=A New Beginning: Policing in Northern Ireland - The Report of the Independent Commission on Policing in Northern Ireland |page=89; §15.2 |accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was for two reasons: to boost nationalist trust of the police, and to improve unionist trust of the GAA. Nationalists were underrepresented in the RUC, contributing to a self-sustaining cycle of mistrust of it as unionist-biased; on the other hand, unionists saw Rule 21 as evidence of the GAA's support for republican violence.

{{Globalize |date = December 2009|discuss=Talk:Scout (sport)#Globalize }}

In [[professional sports]], '''scouts''' are experienced talent evaluators who travel extensively for the purposes of watching athletes play their chosen sports and determining whether their set of skills and talents represent what is needed by the scout's organization. Some scouts are interested primarily in the selection of ''prospects'', younger players who may require further development by the acquiring team but who are judged to be worthy of that effort and expense for the potential future payoff that it could bring, while others concentrate on players who are already polished professionals whose rights may be available soon, either through [[free agent|free agency]] or trading, and who are seen as filling a team's specific need at a certain position.  ''Advance scouts'' watch the teams that their teams are going to play in order to help determine [[strategy]].

Many scouts are former [[coach (sport)|coaches]] or retired players, while others have made a career just of being scouts. Skilled scouts who help to determine which players will fit in well with an organization can be the major difference between success and failure for the team with regard to wins and losses, which often relates directly to the organization's financial success or lack thereof as well.

==Kinds of scouts==
Scouts tend to have to perform one of two tasks, either scouting opposition teams to research the opposition's players and tactics, or scouting individual players to identify their level of skill and to keep track of potential new signings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Owen|first=Gareth|title=Scouting missions broaden horizons during injury absence|url=http://www.thisisstaffordshire.co.uk/Gareth-Owen-Scouting-missions-broaden-horizons/story-14165404-detail/story.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130505113709/http://www.thisisstaffordshire.co.uk/Gareth-Owen-Scouting-missions-broaden-horizons/story-14165404-detail/story.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=5 May 2013|accessdate=17 December 2011|newspaper=[[The Sentinel (Staffordshire)|The Sentinel]]|date=17 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary [[Major League Baseball]] teams usually classify scouts and their differing responsibilities as follows:
*'''Advance scouts''' follow the MLB clubs that their team is scheduled to play and file reports on trends and tendencies that influence pitching, defensive, offensive and game strategy.
*'''Major League scouts''' and '''professional scouts''' (the most senior of whom are sometimes called "special assignment scouts" or "special assistants to the [[general manager (baseball)|general manager]]") typically track active players under contract to other teams for potential acquisition.  They also may support advance scouts or evaluate competing minor league organizations. Per their designation, the former follow players in MLB, while "pro scouts" work [[minor league baseball|minor league]] and [[independent league baseball]].
*'''Amateur scouts''' evaluate [[high school]] and [[college baseball]] players and prepare their MLB teams for the [[Major League Baseball Draft|June amateur draft]].  To ensure that players are seen by multiple evaluators, amateur scouts are usually divided into area scouts, regional cross-checkers and national cross-checkers.
*'''International scouts''' cover players not from the [[United States]], [[Puerto Rico]] and other [[insular areas|U.S. territories]], or [[Canada]]. These players are signed as international [[free agent]]s and are not subject to the June draft, although bonus amounts and signing regulations are governed by the collective bargaining agreement between MLB and its [[Major League Baseball Players Association|players' union]].  In addition to the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Venezuela]], [[Mexico]], and other [[Latin America]]n and [[Caribbean]] countries, where MLB teams have had a scouting presence since the mid-20th century, the growth in international baseball has compelled most teams to station scouts in [[Japan]], [[Korea]] and other [[Asia]]n countries, [[Australia]], and [[Europe]].

According to [[Tony Lucadello]], considered by some to be the greatest scout ever,&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Mike (2004). ''Ninety Feet from Fame: Close Calls With Baseball Immortality''. Pp. 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, David M. (2004). ''Occasional Glory: The History of the Philadelphia Phillies''. Pp. 163–164.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spivak, Jeffrey (2005). ''Crowning the Kansas City Royals: Remembering the 1985 World Series Champs''. P. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joyce, Gare. ''Wall of Dreams.''&lt;/ref&gt; the four kinds of scouts start with the letter 'P':

* '''Poor''' – wastes time looking for games rather than having a planned itinerary
* '''Picker''' – emphasizes a player's one weakness to the neglect of all strengths and ignores the potential within
* '''Performance''' – bases his evaluation on what a player does in his presence
* '''Projector''' – envisions what a player will be able to do in two or three years

Lucadello estimated that five percent of scouts were poor, five percent pickers, 85 percent performance scouts and five percent projectors.&lt;ref&gt;Winegardner, Mark (1990). ''Prophet of the Sandlots: Journeys with a Major League Scout''. P. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''sports league''' is a group of [[sports team]]s that compete against each other in a specific [[sport]]. At its simplest, it may be a local group of [[amateur sports|amateur]] athletes who form teams among themselves and compete on weekends;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://somervillearchives.omeka.net/exhibits/show/recreation1/sports-exercise/adultsports-exercise|title=Adult Sports &amp; Exercise · WHAT PARK DID YOU HANG OUT AT? · Somerville Archives|author=|date=|website=somervillearchives.omeka.net|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151006011940/http://somervillearchives.omeka.net/exhibits/show/recreation1/sports-exercise/adultsports-exercise|archivedate=2015-10-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; at its most complex, it can be an international [[professional sports league organization|professional]] league making large amounts of money and involving dozens of teams and thousands of players.

==Terminology==

===Synonyms===
In many cases, organizations that function as leagues are described using a different term, such as [[National Basketball Association|association]], [[Conference (sports)|conference]], [[Division (sport)|division]], [[league table|leaderboard]], or [[Playoff format|series]]. This is especially common in individual sports, although the term "league" is sometimes used in amateur individual sports such as [[golf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_46/b3908601.htm|title=A Golf League of Their Own|author=|date=|website=businessweek.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091223083227/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_46/b3908601.htm|archivedate=2009-12-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "league" is also sometimes applied to competitions that would more traditionally be called [[tournaments]], such as the [[UEFA Champions League]], which is organized with multiple small round-robin competitions followed by a single elimination tournament to choose an overall winner.

===Leagues and league systems===
"League" and its synonyms may be used to encompass either a single competition or a related group of competitions.

Many groups use [[promotion and relegation]], where the best-ranked team(s) in the ''lower [[division (sport)|division]]'' are ''promoted'' to the ''higher division'' for the next season, and the worst-ranked team(s) in the ''higher division'' are ''relegated'' to the ''lower division'' for the next season. Under this system, the term "league" may be used to refer both to a [[league system]], a group of leagues that are tied together in a hierarchical fashion by promotion and relegation, and to the individual leagues within the league system. For example, in [[Football in England|English association football]], the [[English Football League]] (EFL) is a league system, while the term "National League" refers both to [[National League (division)|the league]] immediately below the EFL in the English pyramid and to [[National League (English football)|its associated league system]].

An alternate system of league organization which is used primarily in Australia, Canada, and the United States is a closed model which always has the same teams playing, with occasional admission of [[expansion teams]] and [[Relocation of professional sports teams|relocation of existing teams]]. There is no team movement between the higher [[major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|''major league'']] and the lower ''[[minor league]]s''.

In many of these closed-model leagues in Canada and the United States, they are divided into subdivisions on historical or geographical lines. These may be referred to as ''conferences'' or ''divisions''. For example, the [[National Football League]] (NFL) is divided into the [[National Football Conference]] and [[American Football Conference]]; the latter conference was formed largely from the remnants of the [[American Football League]] after it [[AFL–NFL merger|merged with the NFL]], though it now contains three original NFL teams and three expansion teams. Both the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) and [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) are divided into Eastern and Western Conferences. The conferences in the NFL, NBA, and NHL are further divided into subsets, all of which are called "divisions." These are geographically based, and teams play their divisional opponents more than any others, and then play the other clubs in their conference more than their non-conference opponents.

Baseball has a unique nomenclature, with "[[Major League Baseball]]" (MLB) the name of the overall grouping of 30 teams in two "major leagues", the [[American League]] (AL) and the older [[National League]] (NL). They are titled leagues rather than conferences for several reasons. The National League predates the American by 25 years and was considered a "major" league in comparison to its early competitors, and in a sense it simply extended this recognition to the AL, the only league of similar financial clout. In addition, the leagues played no interlocking schedule of any kind until 1995, and then added only a small amount of [[interleague play]], with the main AL-NL competition occurring between their champions in the [[World Series]]. Thus the two leagues played mostly separate competitions within the larger framework of MLB. Finally, until 2000, they were actually separate legal entities, unlike the conferences of other leagues. [[Nippon Professional Baseball]] in Japan has a similar history, with the [[Central League]] and [[Pacific League]] not founded together.

Due to this naming custom, it is common to use slightly different terms to discuss MLB. Where someone might refer to "the best [[quarterback]] in the league" and be understood to mean the overall NFL, a similar mention of "the best [[outfielder]] in the league" is almost always a reference to the American ''or'' National League, and "all of baseball" or similar is used to denote the larger status. Each of the major leagues also has its own [[List of Major League Baseball awards|set of awards]] to recognize the separation between the two, which means there are two [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|MVPs]], two [[Cy Young Award|Cy Young]] winners, etc. And since its name is constructed differently—a description of the status of two leagues rather than the title of one—it is common to hear "MLB" without "the" attached to it, as in "the most home runs in MLB this year," since one would not say "the Major League Baseball."

==League organization==
The common thread between all sports leagues is a structure that allows teams or individuals to compete against each other in a nonrandom order on a set schedule, usually called a "season," with the results of the individual competitions being used to name an overall champion.

A league championship may be contested in a number of ways. Each team may play every other team a certain number of times in a [[round-robin tournament]]. Usually, teams play equal number of games or matches at their own stadium and at other teams', because [[home advantage]] is a major factor in many sports. When teams competing for a tournament championship do not play the same teams the same number of times, it is known as an unbalanced schedule.

In such a set-up, the team with the best record becomes champion, based on either a strict win-loss-tie system or on a points system where a certain number of points are awarded for a win, loss, or tie, while bonus points might also be added for teams meeting various criteria. Many leagues also use [[playoffs]], where after teams compete in a regular season in a league format, the top teams (possibly determined by conference or division) advance to the playoffs. In some such leagues having the best regular season record is relatively unimportant, though top-seeded teams in some leagues, such as the [[NFL]], can gain byes to later rounds of the playoffs, and teams finishing with the best records usually have the advantage of playing the weakest teams that have advanced to the playoffs.

==Alternatives to traditional league organization==
While round-robin and modified round-robin competitions are the most common form of league organization, there are a number of ways to organize a sporting competition, almost all of which may be described as a "league". Many sports organizations fall on a continuum between a total lack of organization, as in a pick-up game, and a formal league such as is common at the highest level of professional team sports.

===Non-league sports===
The simplest form of competition is to allow teams to play each other whenever they see fit. In some sports, such as [[horse racing]], the main goal of the entrants is to win individual [[Purse (horse racing)|purses]], and there is little or no ranking or competition outside winning certain major races. A small amount of league organization may be imposed on these non-league sports by way of a series or [[tournament]] tying several individual events together, such as the [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing|Triple Crown]].

Even in team sports that normally use a traditional league format, some teams often exist outside any league; these teams are generally known as [[Barnstorm (sports)|barnstorming]] teams and either schedule games against local professional or amateur competition or bring their own competition, such as the barnstorming [[Harlem Globetrotters]] did when they toured with the [[Washington Generals]]. As with the Globetrotters, barnstorming teams sometimes emphasize spectacle over athletic competition.

In Europe, the term "cup competition" is used to describe [[single elimination]] or [[Tournament#Knockout tournaments|knock-out]] tournaments, where the pairing of teams in each round is determined by a "draw" (see for example, the [[FA Cup#The draw|FA Cup]] in England), to distinguish it from league competition, in which every club in the [[Professional sports league organization#Structure of European leagues|league or division]] plays the other teams a pre-determined number of times in a season, usually on a home and away basis.

Further, in England, the term [[non-league football]] is used for historical reasons to describe [[association football]] teams that play in organized leagues, but not in the [[English Football League]] or [[Premier League]], the two highest levels of competition in that sport in that country.

[[Independent baseball]] is used similarly in the United States to describe [[baseball]] teams that play in leagues other than those sanctioned by [[Major League Baseball]]. These teams do play in leagues and should not be confused with barnstorming teams that play truly non-league schedules.

===Rankings and leaderboards===
Individual sports often use an alternative type of league organization where competitors are ranked against each other. In the simplest cases, such as [[boxing]], the rankings mean little and the major competition is to crown a champion in a title fight.

In other sports, the rankings and leaderboards gain importance when they are used in [[seed (sports)|seed]]ing tournaments.

In some sports, points are assigned to results at individual competitions, and the resulting points are used to generate a season rankings and determine the season champion. While not usually referred to as "leagues", but "tours" or "series", these season-long competitions with set events are very similar to league structures in team sports. Examples of this are [[motorsport]], [[tennis]], [[golf]], [[skiing]], [[beach volleyball]] and [[rugby sevens]].

===Conferences and informal leagues===
American [[college sports]] are traditionally organized into groups of teams known as "conferences."&lt;ref&gt;Some conferences, though, use "league" instead of "conference." [http://www.ivyleaguesports.com/history/overview About The Ivy League] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903051415/http://www.ivyleaguesports.com/history/overview |date=2011-09-03 }}. The Ivy League official website. Council of Ivy Group Presidents. Retrieved 2011-09-05.&lt;/ref&gt; These conferences ordinarily keep league tables and crown champions within the conference, as other sports leagues do, but the individual school also schedule a certain number of "non-conference" games that are organized independently between two schools in different conferences, or between a conference team and a non-conference team. Also, national championships in some college sports are determined by a ranking or playoff system that is independent of the individual conferences.

==Round-robin sports leagues==
Most major team sports play some form of round-robin schedule, where the goal is for each team to play a relatively balanced schedule with each other team in the league or in its league subdivision.  Within this structure, there are a few significant differences between leagues, a few of which are set forth below.

===Single-table versus unbalanced schedule===
The simplest way to organize a sports league, and still one of the most common, is in a double round-robin format where each team plays each other team twice, once at home and once away.  This ensures that every team plays an equally difficult schedule and that no team has undue [[home field advantage]].  This organization is still used in many team sports around the world.

One potential drawback of this simple double round-robin format is that the number of teams in the league determines the schedule.  Larger leagues may not be able to play as many games as such a system would require, and smaller leagues may want more games.  In addition, leagues whose teams are geographically spread out over a wide area (a common situation for leagues in North America) may face significant travel costs.  One solution is to play an unbalanced schedule, with some teams playing additional games against some other teams; this is the way [[Major League Soccer]] has traditionally been scheduled, with the additional games being played against local rivals.  Some leagues also break the league into subunits, often known as "divisions" and "conferences," each of which may itself play a balanced or unbalanced schedule.

===Cups, tournaments and playoffs===
Many sports leagues also participate in a single-elimination tournament each year.  In the United States, Mexico, and some other countries, these tournaments are commonly called "playoffs" and are played at the end of the season, with the teams qualifying for the playoffs based on their performance during the season.  In Europe, "cup" competitions are more common, with all teams playing in a single-elimination tournament that takes place during and parallel with the regular season.

A '''squash ball machine''' is a mechanical device that automatically throws out [[Squash (sports)|squash]] balls at different speeds and angles. Its main purpose is to help players to develop their ball hitting technique.

==Overview==
The features of squash ball machines are modeled after the rules of squash and the constituency of squash balls.

Squash is a ballgame that is played by hitting a ball with a [[Racket (sports equipment)|racket]] against a wall, similar to a [[backboard (tennis)|backboard]], so that the ball bounces off the wall. The opponent player has to hit the ball back against the wall without letting the ball bounce more than once.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ussquash.com/officiate/rules-of-squash/ Rules of Squash] U.S. Squash. Retrieved 2013-02-13.&lt;/ref&gt; The game can be played either by two people (the "singles" version), or by four people (the [[Squash Doubles|doubles]] version), in either a smaller court (singles and softball doubles) or a larger one ([[hardball squash|hardball doubles]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Hickok [http://www.hickoksports.com/rules/rsquashr.shtml Sports rules: Squash rackets] Hickok Sports. Retrieved 2013-02-13&lt;/ref&gt;

The balls used in squash are small rubber [[Squash (sport)#Playing equipment|balls]] that can differ in terms of diameter, weight and softness. These features determine the speed and bouncing amplitude of the ball, with softer balls being generally slower than the harder balls. The temperature of the ball also affects the amount of bounce: the warmer the ball, the more it bounces.&lt;ref name="sb"&gt;[http://www.squashplayer.co.uk/squash_balls.htm Squash balls] Squashplayer.co.uk. Retrieved 2013-02-13.&lt;/ref&gt; Because cold squash balls have little bounce, the squash balls are hit multiple times at the beginning of a game to warm them up. It also means that a game becomes gradually faster as it advances and that softer balls may be too slow to be used in colder climates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-255005/hardball-squash-rackets Hardball squash rackets] Encyclopædia Britannica Online, Retrieved on 2013-02-13&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
Because squash balls bounce with different amplitude and frequency depending on their temperature,&lt;ref name="sb"/&gt; squash ball machines need to encompass this feature and allow for heating the balls first to give the right feel. The heating system makes squash ball machines different from tennis ball machines which only pump out balls at different speeds and angles.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Bronstein [http://www.squashtalk.com/html/news/globalgallery22.htm Global Gallery: Monthly Views on the World of Squash] Squashtalk.com, June 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

The heating function of the machine can be turned down or off, e.g.  for slower balls in beginner practices. In higher-end machines, the heat is thermostatically controlled to automatically keep the balls at game temperature.

The currently available models have ball capacities of 50-60 balls. Both ball speed range and ball frequencies are adjustable and vary from 30 to 150&amp;nbsp;km/h and 1.5-12 balls per second, respectively, with the .75 second interval suitable for quick volleys and 10 second interval for other strokes.&lt;ref name="rbssk"&gt;Richard Millman, Georgetta Morque (2006) ''Raising Big Smiling Squash Kids''. Mansion. {{ISBN|1932421432}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changing the speed and frequency of the ball coming out of the machine is intended to help the player to visualize real-game situations where the ball does not always come back into play at the same speed. The adjustable speed is also useful for increasing the speed as the player becomes more skillful.

The machines have different modes and functions for practicing forehands and backhands, fixed, random, decay, [[interval training]], vertical swing, lob and drop. They are powered by electrical [[AC power|AC]] and [[Direct current|DC]] power supplies and can be [[Remote control|controlled remotely]]. [[Protective eyewear]] is recommended while using the machine.&lt;ref name="wsf6"&gt;Mike Way  and Dan Martyna [http://www.worldsquash.org/ws/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/wsfconf2006.pdf The Cannon - Squash Training with a ball machine] 7th [[World Squash Federation]] Coaching and Development Conference, 8–11 September 2006, Malmo, Sweden.&lt;/ref&gt;

Squash ball machines cannot be used for [[squash tennis]] which is played with [[tennis ball]]s that are considerably bigger than squash balls.

==Uses==
Squash ball machines are used as training aids both by solo players and by coaches in squash practices.

Individual players use the machine as a feeding ([[Serve (tennis)|serving]]) device in the absence of other players to practice their swinging technique and to develop footwork and timing.&lt;ref name="rbssk"/&gt;

In connection with coaching, the following benefits have been mentioned:&lt;ref name="rbssk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wsf6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ma"&gt;Mark Allen [http://lobtohisbackhand.com/squashcannon.htm The Squash Cannon] Lobtohisbackhand.com. Retrieved 2013-02-13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tim Bacon [http://scienceofcoachingsquash.wordpress.com/tag/squash-ball-machine/ Coaching Squash Front-Court Tactics with a Ball Machine] Science of Coaching Squash, December 19, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
* The use of the machine leaves the coach free from feeding the ball and allows closer observation of the student from different angles.
* The coach is able to demonstrate correct technique more frequently and effectively by doing alternate hitting with the student, with the coach hitting and the student trying to imitate the swing.
* The machine allows the coach to physically manipulate the students' swing, by holding the racket in the correct position.
* It allows for realistic hitting angles and positions, and to establish a continuous rhythm of play. Continuous, flowing practices are more enjoyable for the student, however they often result in an unrealistic hitting angles. For example when feeding for a drop volley, coaches often stand in a position in front of the pupil. If the coach is skillful then this allows the practice to flow and be continuous, but unfortunately means the pupil is learning to hit the ball short off of a drive from the front court with their opponent in front of them - when in the game this shot is almost always played off of a length ball with the opponent behind. With a machine, coaches can set up continuous practices that are always using realistic angles and positions.
* In a group practice, the coach is able to give advice specific to one player without having to stop the practice for other students, something he would have to do if he were the one doing the feeding.
* If used in combination with a drilling partner, the ball machine can be used to develop front-court tactics.
* Students acquire technique more easily if they are able to learn in rhythm. The machines allows for a continuous rhythm to be established. The student can miss, miss-hit, or hit the ball down/out and the next ball will still arrive in the rhythm that has been set. Without the machine the rhythm is broken while the misdirected ball is fetched.

==Limitations==
The main limitation of the ball machine is the same as its main benefit, that of excluding a human partner. Because competitive games are played against another person, the singular use of the machine would mean that a player would not learn to anticipate and react to the movement of the ball from the opponent player based on "pre-impact cues"  that precede the time the ball is struck, missing valuable time for planning his or her own response,&lt;ref name="ma"/&gt; and would not develop [[Tactic (method)|tactical]] skills.&lt;ref name="scs2"&gt;Tim Bacon [http://scienceofcoachingsquash.wordpress.com/2010/09/07/why-i-purchased-a-ping-pong-robot-but-wont-buy-a-squash-ball-machine/ Why I Purchased a Ping Pong Robot but Won’t Buy a Squash Ball Machine!] Science of Coaching Squash, September 7th, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Because balls that are thrown by the machine are independent of player's own strokes, the player would also not develop self-reflection and awareness about his or her role in directing the game.&lt;ref name="scs2"/&gt;

'''Strength training''' is a type of [[physical exercise]] specializing in the use of resistance to induce [[muscular contraction]] which builds the [[physical strength|strength]], [[Anaerobic exercise|anaerobic endurance]], and [[Muscle hypertrophy|size]] of [[skeletal muscle]]s.

When properly performed, strength training can provide significant functional benefits and improvement in overall health and well-being, including increased [[bone]], muscle, [[tendon]], and [[ligament]] strength and toughness, improved [[joint]] function, reduced potential for injury,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Shaw| first = I. |author2=Shaw, B.S. | year = 2014| title = Resistance Training and the Prevention of Sports Injuries.

Training commonly uses the technique of progressively increasing the force output of the muscle through incremental weight increases and uses a variety of exercises and types of [[:Category:Weight training equipment|equipment]] to target specific muscle groups. Strength training is primarily an [[anaerobic exercise|anaerobic]] activity, although some proponents have adapted it to provide the benefits of [[aerobic exercise]] through [[circuit training]].

Strength training is typically associated with the production of lactate, which is a limiting factor of exercise performance. Regular endurance exercise leads to adaptations in skeletal muscle which can prevent lactate levels from rising during strength training. This is mediated via activation of PGC-1alpha which alter the LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) isoenzyme complex composition and decreases the activity of the lactate generating enzyme LDHA, while increasing the activity of the lactate metabolizing enzyme LDHB.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Summermatter|first=Serge|last2=Santos|first2=Gesa|last3=Pérez-Schindler|first3=Joaquín|last4=Handschin|first4=Christoph|date=2013-05-21|title=Skeletal muscle PGC-1α controls whole-body lactate homeostasis through estrogen-related receptor α-dependent activation of LDH B and repression of LDH A|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=110|issue=21|pages=8738–43|doi=10.1073/pnas.1212976110|issn=1091-6490|pmc=3666691|pmid=23650363|bibcode=2013PNAS..110.8738S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sports where strength training is central are [[bodybuilding]], [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifting]], [[powerlifting]], [[strongman (strength athlete)|strongman]], [[Highland games]], [[shot put]], [[discus throw]], and [[javelin throw]]. Many other sports use strength training as part of their training regimen, notably [[tennis]], [[American football]], [[wrestling]], [[track and field]], [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]], [[lacrosse]], [[basketball]], [[pole dancing]], [[hockey]], [[professional wrestling]], [[rugby union]], [[rugby league]], and [[soccer]]. Strength training for other sports and physical activities is becoming increasingly popular.

== Uses ==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2008}}
The benefits of weight training include greater muscular strength, improved muscle tone and appearance, increased endurance and enhanced bone density.

=== Increased physical attractiveness ===
Many people take up weight training to improve their [[physical attractiveness]]. There is evidence that a body type consisting of broad shoulders and a narrow waist, attainable through strength training, is the most physically attractive male attribute according to women participating in the research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mautz|first=Brian S.|last2=Wong|first2=Bob B.

An individual's [[Genetics|genetic]] make-up dictates the response to weight training stimuli to a significant extent.  Training can not exceed a muscle's intrinsic genetically determined qualities though polymorphic expression does occur e.g., Myosin heavy chains&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Applications|first=Institute of Medicine (US) Committee on Metabolic Monitoring for Military Field|date=2004-01-01|title=Physiological Biomarkers for Predicting Performance|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK215705/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies also show that people are able to tell the strength of men based on photos of their bodies and faces, and that physical appearance indicates cues of strengths that are often linked to a man's physical formidability and, therefore, his attractiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sell|first=Aaron|last2=Cosmides|first2=Leda|last3=Tooby|first3=John|last4=Sznycer|first4=Daniel|last5=Rueden|first5=Christopher von|last6=Gurven|first6=Michael|date=2009-02-07|title=Human adaptations for the visual assessment of strength and fighting ability from the body and face|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/276/1656/575|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|language=en|volume=276|issue=1656|pages=575–584|doi=10.1098/rspb.2008.1177|issn=0962-8452|pmid=18945661}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is aligned with studies that reveal those who undergo strength training attain more [[self-esteem]] and [[body cathexis]] when compared to individuals who do not undergo training or exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Principles and Practice of Resistance Training|last=Stone|first=Michael|last2=Stone|first2=Meg|last3=Sands|first3=William|publisher=Human Kinetics|year=2007|isbn=9780880117067|location=Champaign, Illinois|pages=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, people who undergo strength training tend to have a more favorable [[body image]] even than those who also engage in regular [[Exercise|physical activities]] such as [[walking]] and [[running]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Body Image Workbook: An Eight-Step Program for Learning to Like Your Looks|last=Cash|first=Thomas|publisher=New Harbinger Publications|year=2008|isbn=9781608826179|location=Oakland, CA|pages=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; More women are also increasingly revealed to be dissatisfied with their body today than those surveyed in 1984 and they often turn to exercise such as strength training to improve their [[body shape]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tighten Your Tummy in 2 Weeks: Lose up to 14 Inches &amp; 14 Pounds of Fat in 14 Days!|last=Darden|first=Ellington|publisher=Rodale|year=2015|isbn=9781623365714|location=New York|pages=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Increased general physical health ===
Strength training also provides functional benefits. Stronger muscles improve posture, provide better support for [[joint]]s, and reduce the risk of [[injury]] from everyday activities. [[Old age|Older]] people who take up weight training can prevent some of the loss of muscle tissue that normally accompanies [[aging]]—and even regain some functional strength—and by doing so become less frail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Gordon|first2=P.

D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may be able to avoid some types of [[physical disability]]. Weight-bearing exercise also helps to prevent [[osteoporosis]] and to improve bone strength in those with osteoporosis.&lt;ref name="pmid21360219"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Bergmann|last3=Boonen|last4=Boutsen|last5=Bruyere|last6=Devogelaer|last7=Goemaere|last8=Hollevoet|last9=Kaufman|year=2011|title=Non-pharmacological management of osteoporosis: a consensus of the Belgian Bone Club|journal=Osteoporos Int|volume=22|issue=11|pages=2769–88|doi=10.1007/s00198-011-1545-x|pmc=3186889|pmid=21360219|author=Body JJ, Bergmann P, Boonen S, Boutsen Y, Bruyere O, Devogelaer JP, Goemaere S, Hollevoet N, Kaufman JM, Milisen K, Rozenberg S, Reginster JY|last10=Milisen|last11=Rozenberg|last12=Reginster}}&lt;/ref&gt; The benefits of weight training for older people have been confirmed by studies of people who began engaging in it even in their 80s and 90s.

Though strength training can stimulate the [[cardiovascular system]], many exercise [[physiologist]]s, based on their observation of maximal [[oxygen]] uptake, argue that [[aerobics]] training is a better cardiovascular stimulus. Central [[catheter]] monitoring during resistance training reveals increased [[cardiac output]], suggesting that strength training shows potential for [[cardiovascular exercise]]. However, a 2007 meta-analysis found that, though aerobic training is an effective therapy for heart failure patients, combined aerobic and strength training is ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Liang|last3=Pechter|last4=Jones|last5=McAlister|last6=Clark|date=2007-06-19|title=A meta-analysis of the effect of exercise training on left ventricular remodeling in heart failure patients: the benefit depends on the type of training performed|journal=J Am Coll Cardiol|volume=49|issue=24|pages=2329–36|doi=10.1016/j.jacc.2007.02.055|pmid=17572248|author=Haykowsky MJ, Liang Y, Pechter D, Jones LW, McAlister FA, Clark AM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strength training may be important to metabolic and cardiovascular health. Recent evidence suggests that resistance training may reduce metabolic and cardiovascular disease risk. Overweight individuals with high strength fitness exhibit metabolic/cardiovascular risk profiles similar to normal-weight, fit individuals rather than overweight unfit individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Lee|first2=M.

=== For rehabilitation or to address an impairment ===
For many people in [[Rehabilitation (neuropsychology)|rehabilitation]] or with an acquired [[disability]], such as following stroke or orthopaedic surgery, strength training for weak muscles is a key factor to optimise recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Dorsch|first2=S.|last3=Canning|first3=C. G.|year=2006|title=Strengthening interventions increase strength and improve activity after stroke: A systematic review|journal=Australian Journal of Physiotherapy|volume=52|issue=4|pages=241–48|doi=10.1016/S0004-9514(06)70003-4|pmid=17132118|last1=Ada|first1=L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For people with such a health condition, their strength training is likely to need to be designed by an appropriate health professional, such as a [[physiotherapist]] or an [[occupational therapist]].

=== Increased sports performance ===
Stronger muscles improve performance in a variety of sports. Sport-specific training routines are used by many competitors. These often specify that the speed of [[muscle contraction]] during weight training should be the same as that of the particular sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Phillips N | year = 1997 | title = Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning | url = | journal = Physiotherapy | volume = 83 | issue = 1| page = 47 | doi = 10.1016/s0031-9406(05)66120-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== For the pleasure of the activity ===
One side effect of intense exercise is increased levels of [[dopamine]], [[serotonin]], and [[norepinephrine]], which can help to improve mood and counter feelings of [[depression (mood)|depression]] (It should be noted that dopamine and serotonin were not found to be increased by resistance training).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=February 2001|title=Effects of physical exercise on anxiety, depression, and sensitivity to stress|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|volume=21|issue=1|pages=33–61|doi=10.1016/S0272-7358(99)00032-X|pmid=11148895|last1=Salmon|first1=Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exercise and Depression|url=http://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/exercise-depression|publisher=WebMD|accessdate=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Developing research has demonstrated that many of the benefits of exercise are mediated through the role of skeletal muscle as an endocrine organ. That is, contracting muscles release multiple substances known as [[myokine]]s which promote the growth of new tissue, tissue repair, and various anti-inflammatory functions, which in turn reduce the risk of developing various inflammatory diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Comprehensive Physiology|year=2013|isbn=9780470650714|volume=3|pages=1337–62|chapter=Muscle as a Secretory Organ|doi=10.1002/cphy.c120033|pmid=23897689|issue=3|author1=Pedersen|first1=B. K.|journal=Comprehensive Physiology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technique ==
The basic principles of strength training involve a manipulation of the number of repetitions (reps), sets, tempo, exercises and force to cause desired changes in strength, endurance or size  by overloading of a group of muscles. The specific combinations of reps, sets, exercises, resistance and force depend on the purpose of the individual performing the exercise: to gain size and strength multiple (4+) sets with fewer reps must be performed using more force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Kargarfard|first2=M.|last3=Danaee|first3=M.|last4=Bahri Mohd Tamrin|first4=S.|year=2015|title=Intensive Resistance Exercise and Circadian Salivary Testosterone Concentrations Among Young Male Recreational Lifters|journal=Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research|volume=29|issue=1|pages=151–58|doi=10.1519/JSC.0000000000000632|pmid=25051005|last1=Shariat|first1=A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A wide spectrum of regimens can be adopted to achieve different results, but the classic formula recommended by the American College of Sports Medicine reads as follows:
* 8 to 12 repetitions of a resistance training exercise for each major muscle group at an intensity of 40% to 80% of a one-repetition max (RM) depending on the training level of the participant.
* Two to three minutes of rest is recommended between exercise sets to allow for proper recovery.
* Two to four sets are recommended for each muscle group&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=May 2013|title=High-Intensity Circuit Training Using Body Weight: Maximum Results With Minimal Investment|journal=ACSM's Health &amp; Fitness Journal|volume=17|issue=3|pages=8–13|doi=10.1249/fit.0b013e31828cb1e8|author=Klika, Brett|author2=Jordan, Chris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically failure to use good form during a training set can result in injury or an inability to meet training goals – since the desired muscle group is not challenged sufficiently, the threshold of [[#Progressive overload|overload]] is never reached and the muscle does not gain in strength. There are cases when cheating is beneficial, as is the case where weaker groups become the weak link in the chain and the target muscles are never fully exercised as a result.

=== Terminology ===
Strength training has a variety of specialized terms used to describe parameters of strength training:
* [[Physical exercise|Exercise]] – different movements which involve rotating joints in specific patterns to challenge muscles in different ways.
* [[Form (exercise)|Form]] – each exercise has a specific form, a topography of movement designed to maximize safety and muscle strength gains.
* Rep – short for repetition, a rep is a single cycle of lifting and lowering a weight in a controlled manner, moving through the form of the exercise.
* [[Weight training|Set]] – a set consists of several repetitions performed one after another with no break between them with the number of reps per set and sets per exercise depending on the goal of the individual. The number of repetitions one can perform at a certain weight is called the Rep Maximum (RM). For example, if one could perform ten reps at 75&amp;nbsp;lbs, then their RM for that weight would be 10RM. [[1RM]] is therefore the maximum weight that someone can lift in a given exercise – i.e. a weight that they can only lift once without a break.
* [[Tempo]] – the speed with which an exercise is performed; the tempo of a movement has implications for the weight that can be moved and the effects on the muscle.

=== Realization of training goals ===
For developing endurance, gradual increases in volume and gradual decreases in intensity is the most effective program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1519/1533-4287(2003)017&lt;0082:ACOLAD&gt;2.0.CO;2| title = A Comparison of Linear and Daily Undulating Periodized Programs with Equated Volume and Intensity for Local Muscular Endurance| journal = The Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research| volume = 17| pages = 82| year = 2003| last1 = Rhea | first1 = M.

Sets of thirteen to twenty repetitions develop anaerobic endurance, with some increases to muscle size and limited impact on strength.&lt;ref name="pollock"&gt;{{cite journal|year=1997|title=Strength Training.

It has been shown that for beginners, multiple-set training offers minimal benefits over single-set training with respect to either strength gain or muscle mass increase, but for the experienced athlete multiple-set systems are required for optimal progress.&lt;ref name=pollock /&gt;&lt;ref name=Laskowski&gt;{{cite web |last=Laskowski |first=ER  |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/strength-training/AN00893 |title=Strength training: How many sets for best results? |publisher=[[Mayo Clinic]]  |deadurl=no |accessdate=2013-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kraemer"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2003|title=Strength training basics: Designing workouts to meet patients' goals|url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=15048162|journal=Physician and Sportsmedicine|volume=31|issue=8|pages=39–45|doi=10.3810/psm.2003.08.457|pmid=20086485|author=Kraemer, W.J.|accessdate=2008-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, one study shows that for leg muscles, three sets are more effective than one set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Egeland|last3=Kvamme|last4=Refsnes|last5=Kadi|last6=Raastad|year=2007|title=Dissimilar effects of one- and three-set strength training on strength and muscle mass gains in upper and lower body in untrained subjects|journal=J Strength Cond Res|volume=21|issue=1|pages=157–63|doi=10.1519/00124278-200702000-00028|pmid=17313291|author=Rønnestad BR, Egeland W, Kvamme NH, Refsnes PE, Kadi F, Raastad T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning weight-trainers are in the process of training the neurological aspects of strength, the ability of the brain to generate a rate of [[neuron]]al [[action potential]]s that will produce a muscular contraction that is close to the maximum of the muscle's potential.

Weights for each exercise should be chosen so that the desired number of repetitions can just be achieved.

=== Progressive overload ===
In one common method, weight training uses the principle of progressive overload, in which the [[muscle]]s are overloaded by attempting to lift at least as much weight as they are capable. They respond by growing larger and stronger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Brooks | first = G.A. | author2 = Fahey, T.D. &amp; White, T.P. | year =1996 | title = Exercise Physiology:  Human Bioenergetics and Its Applications | publisher = Mayfield Publishing Co | isbn = 0-07-255642-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This procedure is repeated with progressively heavier weights as the practitioner gains strength and endurance.

However, performing exercises at the absolute limit of one's strength (known as [[One rep maximum|one rep max]] lifts) is considered too risky for all but the most experienced practitioners. Moreover, most individuals wish to develop a combination of strength, endurance and muscle size. One repetition sets are not well suited to these aims. Practitioners therefore lift lighter (sub-maximal) weights, with more repetitions, to fatigue the muscle and all fibres within that muscle as required by the progressive overload principle.

Commonly, each exercise is continued to the point of momentary muscular failure. Contrary to widespread belief, this is not the point at which the individual thinks they cannot complete any more repetitions, but rather the first repetition that fails due to inadequate muscular strength. [[Training to failure]] is a controversial topic with some advocating training to failure on all sets while others believe that this will lead to [[overtraining]], and suggest training to failure only on the last set of an exercise.&lt;ref name="Stoppani"&gt;Stoppani, Jim (October 2004). [https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-980825861.html Fail – to be strong.] ''Joe Weider's Muscle &amp; Fitness''.&lt;/ref&gt; Some practitioners recommend finishing a set of repetitions just before reaching a personal maximum at a given time. Adrenaline and other hormones may promote additional intensity by stimulating the body to lift additional weight (as well as the neuro-muscular stimulations that happen when in "fight-or-flight" mode, as the body activates more muscle fibres), so getting "psyched up" before a workout can increase the maximum weight lifted.

Weight training can be a very effective form of strength training because exercises can be chosen, and weights precisely adjusted, to safely exhaust each individual muscle group after the specific numbers of sets and repetitions that have been found to be the most effective for the individual. Other strength training exercises lack the flexibility and precision that weights offer.

=== Split training ===
Split training involves working no more than three muscle groups or body parts per day, instead spreading the training of specific body parts throughout a training cycle of several days. It is commonly used by more advanced practitioners due to the logistics involved in training all muscle groups maximally. Training all the muscles in the body individually through their full range of motion in a single day is generally not considered possible due to caloric and time constraints. Split training involves fully exhausting individual muscle groups during a workout, then allowing several days for the muscle to fully recover. Muscles are worked roughly twice per week and allowed roughly 72 hours to recover. Recovery of certain muscle groups is usually achieved on days while training other groups, i.e. a 7-day week can consist of a practitioner training trapezius, side shoulders and upper shoulders to exhaustion on one day, the following day the arms to exhaustion, the day after that the rear, front shoulders and back, the day after that the chest. In this way all mentioned muscle groups are allowed the necessary recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Kraemer, William J. |author2=Zatsiorsky, Vladimir M. |title=Science and Practice of Strength Training, Second Edition |publisher=Human Kinetics Publishers |location=Champaign, Ill |year=2006 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QWSn4iKgNo8C&amp;pg=PP12&amp;dq=strength+training+weekly |isbn=0-7360-5628-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |page= 161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intensity, volume, and frequency ===
Three important variables of strength training are intensity, volume, and frequency. Intensity refers to the amount of [[mechanical work|work]] required to achieve the activity and is [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the [[mass]] of the weights being lifted. Volume refers to the number of muscles worked, exercises, sets, and reps during a single session.  Frequency refers to how many training sessions are performed per week.

These variables are important because they are all mutually conflicting, as the muscle only has so much strength and endurance, and takes time to recover due to [[microtrauma]]. Increasing one by any significant amount necessitates the decrease of the other two, e.g. increasing weight means a reduction of reps, and will require more recovery time and therefore fewer workouts per week. Trying to push too much intensity, volume and frequency will result in [[overtraining]], and eventually lead to injury and other health issues such as chronic soreness and general [[lethargy]], illness or even acute trauma such as [[avulsion fracture]]s. A high-medium-low formula can be used to avoid overtraining, with either intensity, volume, or frequency being high, one of the others being medium, and the other being low. One example of this training strategy can be found in the following chart:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Type!!High!!Med!!Low
|-
| Intensity (% of [[One rep maximum|1RM]])||80–100%||40–70%||0–40%
|-
| Volume (per muscle)||1 exercise||2 exercises||3+ exercises
|-
| Sets||1 set||2–3 sets||4+ sets
|-
| Reps||1–6 reps||8–15 reps||20+ reps
|-
| Session frequency||1 p/w||2–3 p/w||4+ p/w
|}

A common training strategy is to set the volume and frequency the same each week (e.g. training 3 times per week, with 2 sets of 12 reps each workout), and steadily increase the intensity (weight) on a weekly basis. However, to maximize progress to specific goals, individual programs may require different manipulations, such as decreasing the weight, and increase volume or frequency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Luecke|first2=T.|last3=Wendeln|first3=H.|last4=Toma|first4=K.|last5=Hagerman|first5=F.|last6=Murray|first6=T.|last7=Ragg|first7=K.|last8=Ratamess|first8=N.|last9=Kraemer|first9=W.|year=2002|title=Muscular adaptations in response to three different resistance-training regimens: Specificity of repetition maximum training zones|journal=European Journal of Applied Physiology|volume=88|issue=1–2|pages=50–60|doi=10.1007/s00421-002-0681-6|pmid=12436270|last1=Campos|first1=G.|last10=Staron|first10=R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Making program alterations on a daily basis (daily undulating periodization) seems to be more efficient in eliciting strength gains than doing so every 4 weeks (linear periodization),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2002|title=A comparison of linear and daily undulating periodized programs with equated volume and intensity for strength|journal=J Strength Cond Res|volume=16|issue=2|pages=250–55|doi=10.1519/1533-4287(2002)016&lt;0250:ACOLAD&gt;2.0.CO;2|pmid=11991778|author=Rhea MR|author2=Ball SD|author3=Phillips WT|author4=Burkett LN}}&lt;/ref&gt; but for beginners there are no differences between different periodization models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2007|title=A comparison of periodization models during nine weeks with equated volume and intensity for strength|journal=J Strength Cond Res|volume=21|issue=4|pages=1245–50|doi=10.1519/R-20446.1|pmid=18076234|author=Buford TW|author2=Rossi SJ|author3=Smith DB|author4=Warren AJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Periodization ===
There are many complicated definitions for periodization, but the term simply means the division of the overall training program into periods which accomplish different goals.

Periodization is the modulating of volume, intensity, and frequency over time, to both stimulate gains and allow recovery.

In some programs for example; volume is decreased during a training cycle while intensity is increased. In this template, a lifter would begin a training cycle with a higher rep range than he will finish with.

For this example, the lifter has a 1 rep max of 225&amp;nbsp;lb:

{| class="wikitable"
|-

! 4,125!!87%!!78%
|-
| 5||165&amp;nbsp;lb x 4reps||170&amp;nbsp;lb x 4reps||175&amp;nbsp;lb x 4reps||180&amp;nbsp;lb x 4reps||185&amp;nbsp;lb x 4reps

|-
| 6||175&amp;nbsp;lb x 3reps||180&amp;nbsp;lb x 3reps||185&amp;nbsp;lb x 3reps||190&amp;nbsp;lb x 3reps||195&amp;nbsp;lb x 3reps
! 2,775!!92%!!87%
|}

This is an example of periodization where the number of repetitions decreases while the weight increases.

== Practice of weight training ==

=== Methods and equipment ===
{{See also|Weight training#Types of exercises|l1=Weight training: Types of exercises}}
There are many methods of strength training. Examples include [[weight training]], [[circuit training]], [[isometric exercise]], [[gymnastics]], [[plyometrics]], [[Parkour]], [[yoga]], [[Pilates]], [[Super Slow]].

Strength training may be done with minimal or no equipment, for instance [[bodyweight exercise]]s. [[Exercise equipment|Equipment]] used for strength training includes [[barbells]] and [[dumbbells]], [[weight machine]]s and other [[exercise machine]]s, [[weighted clothing]], [[resistance band]]s, [[:Category:gymnastics apparatus|gymnastics apparatus]], [[Swiss ball]]s, [[wobble board (exercise)|wobble boards]], [[indian club]]s, [[pneumatic exercise equipment]], [[hydraulic exercise equipment]].

=== Aerobic exercise versus anaerobic exercise ===
Strength training exercise is primarily [[anaerobic exercise|anaerobic]].&lt;ref name="kraemer"&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2003|title=Strength training basics: Designing workouts to meet patients' goals|journal=The Physician and Sportsmedicine|volume=31|issue=8|pages=39–45|doi=10.3810/psm.2003.08.457|pmid=20086485|author1=Kraemer|first1=W. J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even while training at a lower intensity (training loads of ~20-RM), anaerobic glycolysis is still the major source of power, although [[aerobic exercise|aerobic]] metabolism makes a small contribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2003|title=What is exercise? A primer for practitioners|journal=The Physician and Sportsmedicine|volume=31|issue=3|pages=31–49|doi=10.3810/psm.2003.03.247|doi-broken-date=2018-05-05|pmid=20086460|author1=Knuttgen|first1=H. G.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weight training is commonly perceived as anaerobic exercise, because one of the more common goals is to increase strength by lifting heavy weights. Other goals such as rehabilitation, weight loss, body shaping, and bodybuilding often use lower weights, adding aerobic character to the exercise.

Except in the extremes, a muscle will fire fibres of both the aerobic or anaerobic types on any given exercise, in varying ratio depending on the load on the intensity of the contraction.&lt;ref name=Kraemer /&gt; This is known as the energy system continuum. At higher loads, the muscle will recruit all muscle fibres possible, both anaerobic ("fast-twitch") and aerobic ("slow-twitch"), in order to generate the most force. However, at maximum load, the anaerobic processes contract so forcefully that the aerobic fibers are completely shut out, and all work is done by the anaerobic processes. Because the anaerobic muscle fibre uses its fuel faster than the blood and intracellular restorative cycles can resupply it, the maximum number of repetitions is limited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chiroweb.com/archives/18/07/06.html "Muscle Metabolism: Aerobic vs. Anaerobic"]. chiroweb.com.&lt;/ref&gt; In the aerobic regime, the blood and intracellular processes can maintain a supply of fuel and oxygen, and continual repetition of the motion will not cause the muscle to fail.

[[Circuit weight training]] is a form of exercise that uses a number of weight training exercise sets separated by short intervals. The cardiovascular effort to recover from each set serves a function similar to an aerobic exercise, but this is not the same as saying that a weight training set is itself an aerobic process.

=== Exercises for specific muscle groups ===
{{Main|Weight training exercises}}
[[File:RomanChairBackExtension.JPG|thumb|right|400px|A ''back extension''.]]
Weight trainers commonly divide the body's [[List of muscles in the human body|individual muscles]] into ten major muscle groups. These do not include the [[hip]], [[neck]] and [[forearm]] muscles, which are rarely trained in isolation. The most common exercises for these muscle groups are listed below.

The sequence shown below is one possible way to order the exercises. The large muscles of the lower body are normally trained before the smaller muscles of the [[Upper body strength|upper body]], because these first exercises require more mental and physical energy. The core muscles of the [[torso]] are trained before the [[shoulder]] and [[arm]] muscles that assist them. Exercises often alternate between "pushing" and "pulling" movements to allow their specific supporting muscles time to recover. The stabilizing muscles in the [[waist]] should be trained last.

=== Advanced techniques ===
A number of techniques have been developed to make weight training exercises more intense, and thereby potentially increase the rate of progress. Many weight lifters use these techniques to bring themselves past a plateau, a duration where a weightlifter may be unable to do more lifting repetitions, sets, or use higher weight resistance.

==== Set structure ====

===== Drop sets =====
A drop set is an easy method of strength training where you perform a set of any exercise to failure or right before failure, and then reduce the weight and continue to lift for more repetitions with the decreased weight.

===== Pyramid sets =====
Pyramid sets are weight training sets in which the progression is from lighter weights with a greater number of repetitions in the first set, to heavier weights with fewer repetitions in subsequent sets.

A reverse pyramid is the opposite in which the heavier weights are used at the beginning and progressively lightened.

===== Burnouts =====
Burnouts combine pyramids and drop sets, working up to higher weights with low reps and then back down to lower weights and high reps.There are a few different ways one could perform burnout sets but the main idea is to perform an exercise until failure. You should start with a weight that is 75% of the amount of the maximum amount of weight you can lift for 1 rep. Once you’ve performed the exercise to exhaustion, reduce the weight and perform another set until failure, which will usually consist of much fewer repetitions. Burnout sets sound very similar to supersets but there are differences in the results they produce. Supersets help increase muscle mass, but are more efficient for producing muscle definition and shape. Burnout sets help increase muscle growth because of the buildup of lactic acid in the muscle when it’s forced to the point of failure.

===== Diminishing set =====
The diminishing set method is where a weight is chosen that can be lifted for 20 reps in one set, and then 70 repetitions are performed in as few sets as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Robert and Ross, Don (1988). ''Muscleblasting! Brief and Brutal Shock Training''. Sterling Publishing Co., Inc. {{ISBN|0-8069-6758-7}}. p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Rest-pause =====
The rest-pause training method takes one whole set and breaks it down into a few mini sets. There are two different goals that are associated with rest-pause training, you could use it to increase hypertrophy or increase strength. To increase hypertrophy you would perform a set with weight you are comfortable lifting for 6-10 reps and then set the weight down. Next, take 15 seconds worth of deep breaths and pick the weight back up and lift to failure. Lastly, repeat step two as many times as you want but it is commonly done twice. In order to increase strength using rest-pause method first you would choose a weight that is 85-95% of your one rep max. Then you would perform 1 rep with this weight and follow that up with a 30-45 second break. Then you could repeat this process as many times as you’d like.

===== Giant set =====
The Giant set, is a form of training that targets one muscle group (e.g. the triceps) with four separate exercises performed in quick succession, often to failure and sometimes with the reduction of weight halfway through a set once muscle fatigue sets in. This form of intense training 'shocks' the muscles and as such, is usually performed by experienced trainers and should be used infrequently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=January 2000|title=Heat Shock Protein Expression is Increased in Cardiac and Skeletal Muscles of Fischer 344 Rats After Endurance Training|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-445X.2000.01894.x/full|journal=Experimental Physiology|volume=85|issue=1|pages=97–102|doi=10.1111/j.1469-445X.2000.01894.x|last1=Samelman|first1=T. R.|accessdate=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== {{anchor|Superset}}Combined sets ====
;Supersets: Supersets combine two or more exercises with similar motions to maximize the amount of work of an individual muscle or group of muscles.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} The exercises are performed with no rest period between the exercises. An example would be doing bench press, which predominantly works the pectoralis and triceps muscles, and then moving to an exercise that works just the triceps such as the triceps extension or the pushdown.

;Push-pull supersets: Push-pull supersets are similar to regular supersets, but exercises are chosen which work opposing muscle groups. This is especially popular when applied to arm exercises, for example by combining biceps curls with the triceps pushdown. Other examples include the shoulder press and lat pulldown combination, and the bench press and wide grip row combination.

;Pre-exhaustion: Pre-exhaustion combines an isolation exercise with a compound exercise for the same muscle group. The isolation exercise first exhausts the muscle group, and then the compound exercise uses the muscle group's supporting muscles to push it further than would otherwise be possible. For example, the triceps muscles normally help the pectorals perform their function. But in the "bench press" the weaker triceps often fails first, which limits the impact on the pectorals. By preceding the bench press with the pec fly, the pectorals can be pre-exhausted so that both muscles fail at the same time, and both benefit equally from the exercise.

;Breakdowns: Breakdowns were developed by [[Frederick Hatfield]] and [[Mike Quinn (bodybuilder)|Mike Quinn]] to work the different types of [[muscle fiber]]s for maximum stimulation. Three different exercises that work the same muscle group are selected, and used for a superset. The first exercise uses a heavy weight (~85% of [[1 rep max]]) for around five reps, the second a medium weight (~70% of 1 rep max) for around twelve reps, and finally the third exercise is performed with a light weight (~50% of 1 rep max) for twenty to thirty reps, or even lighter (~40% of 1 rep max) for forty or more reps. ([[Training to failure|Going to failure]] is discouraged.) The entire superset is performed three times.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Robert and Ross, Don (1988). ''Muscleblasting! Brief and Brutal Shock Training''. Sterling Publishing Co., Inc. {{ISBN|0-8069-6758-7}}. pp. 16–17&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Beyond failure ====
;Forced reps: Forced reps occur after momentary muscular failure. An assistant provides just enough help to get the weight trainer past the [[sticking point]] of the exercise, and allow further repetitions to be completed. Weight trainers often do this when they are [[spotting (weight training)|spotting]] their exercise partner. With some exercises forced reps can be done without a training partner. For example, with one-arm ''biceps curls'' the other arm can be used to assist the arm that is being trained.

;Cheat reps: [[Cheating#Strength training|Cheating]] is a deliberate compromise of [[Form (exercise)|form]] to maximize reps. Cheating has the advantage that it can be done without a training partner, but compromises [[Strength training#Safety|safety]]. A typical example of cheat reps occurs during biceps curls when, beginning with the load at the waist, the exerciser swings the barbell or dumbbell forward and up during the concentric phase utilizing momentum to assist their bicep muscles in moving the load to a shortened muscle position. Momentum assistance during the concentric phase allows them to move greater loads during the more difficult concentric phase. The objective can be to position greater loads of resistance to the biceps in preparation of performing the eccentric phase than the more difficult concentric phase would otherwise allow. Replacing a typical function of a training partner with a solo exerciser performing cheat reps facilitates forced reps or [[negative repetition|negative reps]] when training alone.

;Weight stripping a.k.a. Number Setting: Weight stripping is a technique used after failure with a normal resistance in certain exercises, particularly with easily adjustable machines, whereby the weight trainer or a partner gradually reduces the resistance after a full set is taken to failure. With each reduction in resistance, as many possible reps are completed and the resistance is then reduced again. This is continued until the resistance is approximately half the original resistance.

;Negative reps: [[Negative repetition|Negative reps]] are performed with much heavier weights. Assistants lift the weight, and then the weight trainer attempts to resist its downward progress through an eccentric contraction. Alternatively, an individual can use an exercise machine for negatives by lifting the weight with both arms or legs, and then lowering it with only one. Or they can simply lower weights more slowly than they lift them: for example, by taking two seconds to lift each weight and four seconds to lower it.

;Partial reps: Partial reps, as the name implies, involves movement through only part of the normal path of an exercise. Partial reps can be performed with heavier weights. Usually, only the easiest part of the repetition is attempted.

;Burns: Burns involve mixing partial reps into a set of full range reps in order to increase intensity. The partials can be performed at any part of the exercise movement, depending on what works best for the particular exercise. Also, the partials can either be added after the end of a set or in some alternating fashion with the full range reps.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Robert and Weis, Dennis (1986) ''Mass!, New Scientific Bodybuilding Secrets''. Contemporary Books. {{ISBN|0-8092-4940-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, after performing a set of ''biceps curls'' to failure, an individual would cheat the bar back to the most contracted position, and then perform several partial reps.

==== Other techniques ====
;Progressive movement training: Progressive movement training attempts to gradually increase the [[range of motion]] throughout a training cycle. The lifter will start with a much heavier weight than they could handle in the full range of motion, only moving through the last 3–5" of the movement.  Throughout the training cycle, the lifter will gradually increase the range of motion until the joint moves through the full range of the exercise.  This is a style that was made popular by Paul Anderson.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

;Time under tension: Time under tension or TUT repetitions are performed with lighter weights. Time under tension refers to the amount of time your muscle under stress during a set. This consists of the time spent in the concentric or the shortening phase, peak contraction phase, as well as the eccentric or the lengthening phase. For example, if you go perform a set of 10 reps and each rep takes 3 seconds to complete, your muscle is under tension for a total of 30 seconds. If you were to perform the same exercise but if you spent 2 seconds in the concentric phase, 1 second to stop during peak contraction, and 3 seconds to lower the weight during the eccentric phase of the rep, the same 10 reps would end up putting your muscles under tension for about 60 seconds.

[[File:WristStrap.JPG|right|thumb|150px|Using a wrist strap.]]

;Wrist straps: Wrist straps (lifting straps) are sometimes used to assist in gripping very heavy weights. Wrist straps can be used to isolate muscle groups like in "lat pull-downs", where the trainee would primarily use the latissimus dorsi muscles of the back rather than the biceps. They are particularly useful for the ''deadlift''. Some lifters avoid using wrist straps to develop their [[grip strength]], just as some go further by using thick bars. Wrist straps can allow a lifter initially to use more weight than they might be able to handle safely for an entire set, as unlike simply holding a weight, if it is dropped then the lifter must descend with it or be pulled down. Straps place stress on the bones of the wrist which can be potentially harmful if excessive.

== Combined techniques ==
Strength training may involve the combining of different training methods such as weight training, plyometrics, bodyweight exercises, and ballistic exercises. This is often done in order to improve a person's ability to apply their strength quickly. Or in other words, to improve their ability to apply explosive power.

=== Loaded plyometrics ===
Loaded plyometrics involve the addition of weights to jumping exercises. The weights may be held or worn. For instance, vertical jumps whilst holding a trap bar or jumping split squats whilst holding dumbbells. This helps to enhance the explosive power of the athlete.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, Derek, Kennelly, Steve, 'Equipment' in ''Plyometric Anatomy'', Leeds: Human Kinetics, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Complex training ===
Complex training, also known as contrast training, involves the alternation of weight training and plyometric exercises. Ideally, both sets of exercises should move through similar ranges of movement; such a pairing is called a complex, or contrast, pair. For instance, a set of heavy back squats at about 85-95% 1RM followed by a set of jumping exercises. The intention is to utilise the intense nervous system activation and increased muscle fibre recruitment from the heavy lift in the plyometric exercise; thereby increasing the power with which it can be performed. Over a period of training, this may result in the athlete being able to perform the plyometric exercise more powerfully, without the requirement of the preceding heavy lift.&lt;ref&gt;Fleck, Steven J. &amp; Kraemer, William J., ‘Complex Training, or Contrast Loading’ in ''Designing Resistance Training Programmes'', Human Kinetics: Leeds, 2013, p.253&lt;/ref&gt; Working on the same principles, a sports specific action may be incorporated instead of the plyometric exercise; the intention, in this case, being to increase the athlete's ability to perform the sports specific action more powerfully.

=== Ballistic training ===
Ballistic training, sometimes referred to as power training, is based upon the principle of maximising the acceleration phase of the exercise and minimising the deceleration phase; this helps to improve the athlete's explosive power. On this basis, ballistic training may include exercises which involve the throwing of a weight, such as a medicine ball, or jumping whilst holding or wearing a weight.&lt;ref&gt;Fleck, Steven J. &amp; Kraemer, William J., 'Ballistic Training' in ''Designing Resistance Training Programmes'', Human Kinetics:Leeds, 2013, p.280&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contrast loading ===
Contrast loading is the alternation of heavy and light loads i.e. a heavy bench press set at about 85-95% 1RM followed by a light bench press set at about 30-60% 1RM. The heavy set should be performed fast with the light set being performed as fast as possible. The joints should not be locked as this inhibits muscle fibre recruitment and reduces the speed at which the exercise can be performed. A loaded plyometric exercise, or ballistic exercise, may take the place of the light lift.

Similarly to complex training, contrast loading relies on the intense nervous system activation and enhanced muscle fibre recruitment from the heavy lift to help improve the power with which the subsequent exercise can be performed.&lt;ref&gt;McGuigan, Mike, ‘Contrast Training’ in ''Developing Power'', Leeds: Human Kinetics, 2017, 196-197&lt;/ref&gt; This physiological effect is commonly referred to as post-activation potentiation, or the PAP effect. By way of explanation, if a light weight is lifted, and then a heavy weight is lifted, and then the same light weight is lifted again, then the light weight will feel lighter the second time it is lifted. This is due to the increased PAP effect from the heavy lift allowing for greater power to be applied and thus making the subsequent lighter lift feel even lighter than before. Explosive power training programmes are frequently designed to specifically utilise the PAP effect.

== Risks and concerns ==
{{Howto|section|date=July 2009}}
Strength training is a safe form of exercise when the movements are controlled, and carefully defined. Or some safety measures can also be taken before the training. However, as with any form of exercise, improper execution and the failure to take appropriate precautions can result in injury. A helmet, boots, gloves, and back belt can aide in injury prevention. Principles of [[Weight training#Safety|weight training safety]] apply to strength training.

=== Bodybuilding ===
{{Main|Bodybuilding}}
[[Bodybuilding]] is a sport in which the goal is to increase muscle size and definition. Bodybuilding increases the endurance of muscles, as well as strength, though not as much as if it were the primary goal. Bodybuilders compete in bodybuilding competitions, and use specific principles and methods of strength training to maximize muscular size and develop extremely low levels of [[adipose tissue|body fat]]. In contrast, most strength trainers train to improve their strength and endurance while not giving special attention to reducing body fat below normal. Strength trainers tend to focus on compound exercises to build basic strength, whereas bodybuilders often use isolation exercises to visually separate their muscles, and to improve muscular [[symmetry]]. Pre-contest training for bodybuilders is different again, in that they attempt to retain as much muscular tissue as possible while undergoing severe [[dieting]]. However, the bodybuilding community has been the source of many strength training principles, techniques, vocabulary, and customs.

=== Nutrition ===
It is widely accepted that strength training must be matched by changes in [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] in order to be effective. Although aerobic exercise has been proven to have an effect on the dietary intake of macronutrients, strength training has not &lt;ref name="IS2008"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2008|title=Self-reported dietary intake following endurance, resistance and concurrent endurance and resistance training|journal=Journal of Sports Science &amp; Medicine|volume=7|issue=2|pages=255–59|pmc=3761454|pmid=24149458|author=Shaw, B.S.|author2=Shaw, I.|author3=Brown, G.A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an increase in dietary [[protein]] is generally believed to be required for building skeletal muscle.

A review of 49 research studies found that supplementation of protein in the diet of healthy adults increased the size and strength of muscles during prolonged resistance exercise training; protein intakes of greater than 1.6 g/kg/day did not additionally increase fat-free mass or muscle size or strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Morton RW, Murphy KT, McKellar SR, Schoenfeld BJ, Henselmans M, Helms E, Aragon AA, Devries MC, Banfield L, Krieger JW, Phillips SM |title=A systematic review, meta-analysis and meta-regression of the effect of protein supplementation on resistance training-induced gains in muscle mass and strength in healthy adults |journal=Br J Sports Med |volume=52 |issue=6 |pages=376–384 |date=March 2018 |pmid=28698222 |pmc=5867436 |doi=10.1136/bjsports-2017-097608 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protein that is neither needed for cell growth and repair nor consumed for energy is converted into urea mainly through the deamination process and is excreted by the kidneys. It was once thought that a high-protein diet entails risk of [[kidney]] damage, but studies have shown that kidney problems only occur in people with previous [[kidney disease]]. However failure to properly hydrate can put an increased strain on the kidney's ability to function.&lt;ref&gt;Shea, Lisa.

L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A light, balanced meal prior to the workout (usually one to two hours beforehand) ensures that adequate energy and amino acids are available for the intense bout of exercise. The type of nutrients consumed affects the response of the body, and [[nutrient timing]] whereby protein and carbohydrates are consumed prior to and after workout has a beneficial impact on muscle growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2004|title=Influence of nutrition on responses to resistance training|url=http://www.purdue.edu/swo/nutrition/KnowItAll/HealthyWeightGain/InfluenceOfNutritionOnWtGain.pdf|journal=Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise|volume=36|issue=4|pages=689–96|doi=10.1249/01.mss.0000121944.19275.c4|pmid=15064597|author1=Volek|first1=J. S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water is consumed throughout the course of the workout to prevent poor performance due to [[dehydration]]. A protein shake is often consumed immediately&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Hayes|year=2006|title=Effects of supplement timing and resistance exercise on skeletal muscle hypertrophy|url=http://eprints.vu.edu.au/1436/1/MSSE2006_(3).pdf|journal=Med Sci Sports Exerc|volume=38|issue=11|pages=1918–25|doi=10.1249/01.mss.0000233790.08788.3e|pmid=17095924|author=Cribb PJ, Hayes A}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the workout, because both protein uptake and protein usage are increased at this time.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Glucose (or another simple sugar) is often consumed as well since this quickly replenishes any [[glycogen]] lost during the exercise period.
To maximise muscle protein anabolism, recovery drink should contain glucose (dextrose), protein (usually [[whey]]) hydrolysate containing mainly dipeptides and tripeptides, and [[leucine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2006|title=Hyperinsulinaemia, hyperaminoacidaemia and post-exercise muscle anabolism: the search for the optimal recovery drink|journal=British Journal of Sports Medicine|volume=40|issue=11|pages=900–05|doi=10.1136/bjsm.2006.030031|pmc=2465040|pmid=16950882|author=Manninen AH.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some weight trainers also take [[ergogenic aid]]s such as [[creatine]] or [[steroid]]s to aid muscle growth. However, the effectiveness of some products is disputed and others are potentially harmful.

=== Sex differences in mass gains ===

Due to the androgenic hormonal differences between males and females, the latter are generally unable to develop large muscles regardless of the training program used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://us.commercial.lifefitness.com/content.cfm/strengthtrainingforwomen_1 |title=Strength Training for Women |publisher=IDEA Personal Trainer |last=Freedson |first=PS |accessdate=2008-02-06 |date=2000-07-01 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716223517/http://us.commercial.lifefitness.com/content.cfm/strengthtrainingforwomen_1 |archivedate=July 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Normally the most that can be achieved is a look similar to that of a [[fitness and figure competition|fitness model]]. Muscle is [[density|denser]] than fat, so someone who builds muscle while keeping the same body weight will occupy less volume; if two people weigh the same (and are the same height) but have different lean body mass percentages, the one with more muscle will appear thinner.&lt;ref name="Ebben"&gt;{{cite journal|date=May 1998|title=Strength training for women: Debunking myths that block opportunity|journal=The Physician and Sportsmedicine|volume=26|issue=5|pages=86–97|doi=10.3810/psm.1998.05.1020|pmid=20086816|author=Ebben, W.P.|author2=Jensen, R.L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, though bodybuilding uses the same principles as strength training, it is with a goal of gaining muscle bulk.  Strength trainers with different goals and programs will not gain the same mass as a professional bodybuilder.

=== Muscle toning ===
{{More citations needed|date=February 2012}}
Some weight trainers perform light, high-repetition exercises in an attempt to "tone" their muscles without increasing their size.

The word tone derives from the Latin "tonus" (meaning "tension"). In anatomy and physiology, as well as medicine, the term "muscle tone" refers to the continuous and passive partial contraction of the muscles, or the muscles' resistance to passive stretching during resting state as determined by a deep tendon reflex. [[Muscle tone|Muscle tonus]] is dependent on neurological input into the muscle. In medicine, observations of changes in muscle tonus can be used to determine normal or abnormal states which can be indicative of pathology. The common strength training term "tone" is derived from this use.

What muscle builders refer to as a ''toned physique'' or "muscle firmness" is one that combines reasonable muscular size with moderate levels of body fat, qualities that may result from a combination of diet and exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Lies, Damned Lies, and Muscle Tone | publisher = CrossFit Impulse|url=http://crossfitimpulse.com/lies-damned-lies-and-muscle-tone/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muscle tone or firmness is derived from the increase in [[actin]] and [[myosin]] cross filaments in the [[sarcomere]]. When this occurs the same amount of neurological input creates a greater firmness or tone in the resting continuous and passive partial contraction in the muscle.

Exercises of 6–12 reps cause hypertrophy of the [[sarcoplasm]] in [[Skeletal muscle#Skeletal muscle fiber types|slow-twitch and high-twitch muscle fibers]], contributing to overall increased muscle bulk. This is not to be confused with [[myofibril]] hypertrophy which leads to strength gains. Both however can occur to an extent during this rep range. ''Even though most are of the opinion that higher repetitions are best for producing the desired effect of muscle firmness or tone, it is not.'' Low volume strength training of 5 repetitions or fewer will increase strength by increasing [[actin]] and [[myosin]] cross filaments thereby increasing muscle firmness or tone. The low volume of this training will inhibit the hypertrophy effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=December 1995|title=Capillary growth in chick skeletal muscle with normal maturation and hypertrophy|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0034568795000607|journal=Respiration Physiology|volume=102|issue=2–3|pages=293–301|doi=10.1016/0034-5687(95)00060-7|pmid=8904020|last1=Snyder|first1=Gregory K.|accessdate=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lowered-calorie diets have no positive effect on [[muscle hypertrophy]] for muscle of any  fiber type. They may, however, decrease the thickness of [[subcutaneous fat]] (fat between muscle and skin), through an overall reduction in body fat, thus making muscle striations more visible.

=== Weight loss ===
Exercises like sit-ups, or abdominal crunches, performs less work than whole-body aerobic exercises&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.physsportsmed.com/issues/1997/06jun/sit_up.htm | last = Stamford | first = B | year = 1997 | title = The right way to do sit-ups | journal = The Physician and Sportsmedicine | volume = 25 | issue = 6|doi=10.3810/psm.1997.06.1433| doi-broken-date = 2018-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; thereby expending fewer calories during exercise than jogging, for example.

Hypertrophy serves to maintain muscle mass, for an elevated [[basal metabolic rate]], which has the potential to burn more calories in a given period compared to aerobics. This helps to maintain a higher metabolic rate which would otherwise diminish after metabolic adaption to dieting, or upon completion of an aerobic routine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Andersen|first=R.E.|year=2003|title=Physical activity and weight management: Building the case for exercise|journal=The Physical and Sportsmedicine|volume=31|issue=9|pages=39–45|doi=10.3810/psm.2003.11.557|pmid=20086447|author2=Jakicic, J.M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weight loss also depends on the type of strength training used. Weight training is generally used for bulking, but the bulking method will more than likely not increase weight because of the diet involved. However, when resistance or circuit training is used, because they are not geared towards bulking, women tend to lose weight more quickly. Lean muscles require calories to maintain themselves at rest, which will help reduce fat through an increase in the [[basal metabolic rate]].

== History ==
[[File:EarlyBarbell.png|right|thumb|upright|[[Arthur Saxon]] performing a [[Two Hands Anyhow]] with an early [[kettlebell]] and plate-loaded [[barbell]].]]
Until the 20th century, the history of strength training was very similar to the history of weight training. With the advent of modern technology, materials and knowledge, the methods that can be used for strength training have multiplied significantly.

[[Hippocrates]] explained the principle behind strength training when he wrote "that which is used develops, and that which is not used wastes away", referring to muscular [[Muscle hypertrophy|hypertrophy]] and [[Atrophy#Muscle atrophies|atrophy]]. Progressive resistance training dates back at least to [[Ancient Greece]], when legend has it that wrestler [[Milo of Croton]] trained by carrying a newborn [[calf]] on his back every day until it was fully grown. Another Greek, the physician [[Galen]], described strength training exercises using the [[halteres (ancient Greece)|halteres]] (an early form of [[dumbbell]]) in the 2nd century.  Ancient [[Persia]]ns used the [[Indian club|''meels'']], which became popular during the 19th century as the Indian club, and has recently made a comeback in the form of the clubbell.

The dumbbell was joined by the [[barbell]] in the latter half of the 19th century. Early barbells had hollow globes that could be filled with [[sand]] or [[lead shot]], but by the end of the century these were replaced by the plate-loading barbell commonly used today.&lt;ref name=Todd&gt;{{cite journal |last=Todd |first=Jan |year=1995 |format=PDF |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/IGH/IGH0306/IGH0306c.pdf |title=From Milo to Milo: A History of Barbells, Dumbells&lt;!--sic--&gt;, and Indian Clubs |journal=Iron Game History |volume=3 |issue=6 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2013-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strength training with [[isometric exercise]] was popularised by [[Charles Atlas]] from the 1930s onwards. The 1960s saw the gradual introduction of [[exercise machine]]s into the still-rare strength training gyms of the time. Strength training became increasingly popular in the 1980s following the release of the bodybuilding movie ''[[Pumping Iron]]'' and the subsequent popularity of [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].&lt;ref name=U.S.C.D.P.&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13956966/ "Sculpted trend spurs women to pump iron"].

=== Safety concerns related to children ===

[[Orthopedic surgery|Orthopaedic]] specialists used to recommend that children avoid weight training because the [[growth plate]]s on their [[bone]]s might be at risk. The very rare reports of growth plate fractures in children who trained with weights occurred as a result of inadequate supervision, improper form or excess weight, and there have been no reports of injuries to growth plates in youth training programs that followed established guidelines.&lt;ref name = KH&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kidshealth.org/parent/nutrition_fit/fitness/strength_training.html | title = Strength Training and Your Child | publisher = kidshealth.org | last = Dowshen | first = S |author2=Homeier B  | accessdate = 2008-01-18 | date = 2005-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NSCA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsca-lift.org/HotTopic/download/Youth%20Hot%20Topics.pdf |format=pdf |accessdate=2008-01-18 |publisher=National Strength and Conditioning Association |last=Faigenbaum |first=AD |title=Youth Resistance Training |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717045321/http://www.nsca-lift.org/HotTopic/download/Youth%20Hot%20Topics.pdf |archivedate=July 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The position of the National Strength and Conditioning Association is that strength training is safe for children if properly designed and supervised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsca-lift.org/Publications/YouthforWeb.pdf |format=pdf |title=Position statement:  Youth Resistance Training |publisher=National Strength and Conditioning Association |accessdate=2008-01-18 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717045336/http://www.nsca-lift.org/Publications/YouthforWeb.pdf |archivedate=July 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Younger children are at greater risk of injury than adults if they drop a weight on themselves or perform an exercise incorrectly; further, they may lack understanding of, or ignore the safety precautions around weight training equipment.  As a result, supervision of minors is considered vital to ensuring the safety of any youth engaging in strength training.&lt;ref name = KH /&gt;&lt;ref name = NSCA /&gt;

==== Australia's stance on pre-adolescence strength training  ====
Strength training is the fourth most popular form of fitness in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Berry, S. (2015). [http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/diet-and-fitness/top-fitness-trends-for-2015-20150106-12j220.html Top fitness trends for 2015]. ''The Sydney Morning Herald''&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its popularity amongst all ages, there is great scepticism on what the appropriate age to commence strength training in young athletes is. Some points of the opposing view of strength training in young adolescence are stunted growth, health and bone problems in later stages of life and unhealthy eating habits.&lt;ref&gt;Stenson, J. (2003). [http://www.nbcnews.com/Default.aspx?id=3076614&amp;p1=0#.VzrQuJF97ic Should kids pump iron?]. msnbc.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies by Australian experts that have been recognised by the [[Australian Institute of Sport]] (AIS) have debunked these myths. There is no link between any prolonged health risks and strength training in pre-adolescence if the procedures of strength training are followed correctly and under suitable supervision. Strength training for pre-adolescents should focus on skills and techniques. Children should only work on strengthening all the big muscle groups, using free weight and body weight movements with relatively light loads. The benefits of these practices include increased strength performance, injury prevention and learning good training principles.&lt;ref&gt;Sibte, N. [http://www.ausport.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/145971/Article_weight_training_preadolescent_strength_training_Narelle_Sibte.pdf Weight training – Pre-adolescent strength training – Just do it!] Australian Institute Of Sport.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== For older adults ===
Older adults are prone to loss of muscle strength.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2011|title=Progressive resistance strength training for improving physical function in older adults|journal=International Journal of Older People Nursing|volume=6|issue=3|pages=244–46|doi=10.1111/j.1748-3743.2011.00291.x|pmid=21884490|author=Christie, J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Chiung-Ju|last2=Latham|first2=Nancy K.|date=2009-07-08|title=Progressive resistance strength training for improving physical function in older adults|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=3|pages=CD002759|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002759.pub2|issn=1469-493X|pmc=4324332|pmid=19588334}}&lt;/ref&gt; With more strength older adults have  better health, better [[quality of life]], better physical function&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and fewer [[Falling (accident)|falls]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In cases in which an older person begins strength training, their doctor or health care provider may neglect to emphasize a strength training program which results in muscle gains. Under-dosed strength training programs should be avoided in favor of a program which matches the abilities and goals of the person exercising.&lt;ref name="APTAfive"&gt;{{Citation|title=Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question|date=15 September 2014|url=http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/american-physical-therapy-association/|author1=American Physical Therapy Association|author1-link=American Physical Therapy Association|work=[[Choosing Wisely]]: an initiative of the [[ABIM Foundation]]|publisher=American Physical Therapy Association|accessdate=15 September 2014}}, which cites

In setting up an exercise program for an older adult, they should go through a [[Baseline (medicine)|baseline]] fitness assessment to determine their current limits. Any exercise program for older adults should match the intensity, frequency, and duration of exercise that the person can perform. The program should have a goal of increased strength as compared to the baseline measurement.&lt;ref name="APTAfive" /&gt;

Recommended training for older adults is three times a week of light strength training exercises. Exercise machines are a commonly used equipment in a gym setting, including treadmills with exercises such as walking or light jogging. Home-based exercises should usually consist of body weight or elastic band exercises that maintain a low level of impact on the muscles. Weights can also be used by older adults if they maintain a lighter weight load with an average amount of repetitions (10–12 reps) with suitable supervision. It is important for older adults to maintain a light level of strength training with low levels of impact to avoid injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2012|title=Progressive resistance strength training can reduce physical disability in older adults|journal=British Journal of Sports Medicine|volume=46|issue=5|pages=323–24|doi=10.1136/bjsports-2012-091018|pmid=22442190|author1=Keuerleber, J.|author2=Henschke, N.|lastauthoramp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Older people who exercise against a resistance or force become stronger .&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Progressive resistance training (PRT)  also improves physical functioning in older people, including the performance of  simple (e.g.: walking, climbing stairs, rising from a chair more quickly) and complex daily activities (e.g.: bathing, cooking).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Caution is recommended when transferring PRT exercises for clinical populations, as adverse effects are unclear.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Image:universityofbath indoor tennis courts arp.jpg|thumb|right|Indoor tennis courts at the [[TeamBath|University of Bath]], England]]

A '''tennis court''' is the venue where the sport of [[tennis]] is played. It is a firm rectangular surface with a low net stretched across the center. The same surface can be used to play both [[Types of tennis match|doubles and singles]] matches. A variety of surfaces can be used to create a tennis court, each with its own characteristics which affect the playing style of the game.

==Dimensions==
[[File:Tennis court imperial.svg|thumb|The dimensions of a tennis court.]]
The dimensions of a tennis court are defined and regulated by the [[International Tennis Federation]] (ITF) governing body and are written down in the annual 'Rules of Tennis' document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ITF Rules of Tennis|url=http://itf.uberflip.com/i/428396-2015-rules-of-tennis-english/0|publisher=ITF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The court is {{convert|78|ft|m|2|abbr=off}} long. Its width is {{convert|27|ft|m|2|abbr=off}} for singles matches and {{convert|36|ft|m|2|abbr=off}} for doubles matches.&lt;ref name="Rule 1 - The Court"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://itf.uberflip.com/i/428396-2015-rules-of-tennis-english/5|title=Rule 1 – The Court|publisher=[[International Tennis Federation]]|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The service line is {{convert|21|ft|m|2|abbr=off}} from the net.&lt;ref name="Rule 1 - The Court"/&gt; Additional clear space around the court is needed in order for players to reach overrun balls for a total of {{convert|60|ft|m|abbr=off}} wide and {{convert|120|ft|m|abbr=off}} long. A net is stretched across the full width of the court, parallel with the baselines, dividing it into two equal ends. The net is {{convert|3|ft|6|in|m|abbr=off}} high at the posts, and {{convert|3|ft|m|abbr=off}} high in the center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.thinkquest.org/C0125827/tennis.htm Rules of tennis] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206102855/http://library.thinkquest.org/C0125827/tennis.htm |date=6 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The net posts are {{convert|3|ft|m|abbr=off}} outside the doubles court on each side or, for a singles net, {{convert|3|ft|m|abbr=off}} outside the singles court on each side.

===Smaller courts===
The ITF's Play and Stay campaign promotes playing on smaller courts with slower red, orange and green balls for younger children. This gives children more time and control so they can serve, rally, and score from the first lesson on courts that are sized to fit their bodies. The ITF has mandated that official competition for children under 10 years of age should be played on "Orange" courts {{convert|18|m|ft|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|6.4|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide. Competition for children under 8 years is played on "Red" courts that are {{convert|11|m|ft|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|5.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide. The net is always 0.8 m high in the center.&lt;ref name=playstay&gt;[http://www.tennisplayandstay.com ITF Play and Stay]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surfaces==
Tennis is played on a variety of surfaces and each surface has its own characteristics which affect the playing style of the game. There are four main types of courts depending on the materials used for the court surface: [[Clay court|clay]] courts, [[hardcourt|hard]] courts, [[Grass court|grass]] courts and [[carpet court]]s. The [[International Tennis Federation]] (ITF) lists different surfaces and properties and classifies surfaces into one of five pace settings:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Court Pace Classification Programme|url=http://www.itftennis.com/technical/equipment/courts/class.asp|publisher=ITF|accessdate=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Category 1 (slow)
* Category 2 (medium-slow)
* Category 3 (medium)
* Category 4 (medium-fast)
* Category 5 (fast)

Of the current four [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournaments, the [[Australian Open|Australian]] and [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] use hard courts, [[French Open]] is played on clay, and [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], the only Grand Slam to have always been played on the same surface, is played on grass. The Australian Open switched to hard courts in 1988 and in its early years the French championship alternated between clay and sand/rubble courts. The US Open is the only major to have been played on three surfaces; it was played on grass from its inception until 1974, clay from 1975 until 1977 and hard courts since it moved from the [[West Side Tennis Club]] to the [[Billie Jean King National Tennis Center|National Tennis Center]] in 1978.

ITF uses the following classification for tennis court surface types:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ITF Approved Tennis Balls, Classified Surfaces &amp; Recognised Courts 2015|url=http://www.itftennis.com/media/200593/200593.pdf|publisher=[[International Tennis Federation]] (ITF)|page=62|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clay courts===
{{Main|Clay court}}
[[File:ND DN 2006FO.jpg|thumbnail|The [[French Open]] is played on clay courts.]]
Clay courts are made of crushed shale, stone or brick.&lt;ref name="ITF Surfaces"/&gt; The French Open is the only Grand Slam tournament to use clay courts.

Clay courts slow down the ball and produce a high bounce in comparison to grass or hard courts.&lt;ref name="ITF Surfaces"/&gt; For this reason, the clay court takes away many of the advantages of big serves, which makes it hard for serve-based players to dominate on the surface. Clay courts are cheaper to construct than other types of tennis courts, but a clay surface costs more to maintain. Clay courts need to be rolled to preserve flatness. The clay's water content must be balanced; green clay courts generally require the courts to be sloped to allow water run-off.

Clay courts are more common in Europe and Latin America than in North America, and tend to heavily favour baseline players.

Historically for the [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slams]] clay courts have been used at the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] from 1975 to 1977 and the [[French Open]] since 1891.

===Grass courts===
{{Main|Grass court}}
[[File:London - Wimbledon - 3065.jpg|thumb|right|Grass court maintenance at [[Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]]]]
Grass courts are the fastest type of courts in common use.&lt;ref name="ITF Surfaces"/&gt; They consist of grass grown on very hard-packed soil, which adds additional variables: bounces depend on how healthy the grass is, how recently it has been mowed, and the wear and tear of recent play. [[point (tennis)|Point]]s are usually very quick where fast, low bounces keep rallies short, and the [[serve (tennis)|serve]] plays a more important role than on other surfaces. Grass courts tend to favour [[serve-and-volley]] tennis players.

Grass courts were once among the most common tennis surfaces, but are now rare due to high maintenance costs as they must be watered and mown often, and take a longer time to dry after rain than hard courts. The grass surface, however, is the most physically forgiving to the human body because of its softness.

Historically for the [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slams]] grass courts have been used at the [[Australian Open]] from 1905 to 1987, the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] from 1881 to 1974, and [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] since 1877.

===Hard courts===
{{Main|Hardcourt}}
[[File:RoofCourt.jpg|thumb|right|Rooftop tennis hardcourts in Downtown [[Singapore]]]]
Hard courts are made of uniform rigid material, often covered with an [[acrylic resin|acrylic]] surface layer&lt;ref name="ITF Surfaces"/&gt; to offer greater consistency of bounce than other outdoor surfaces.&lt;ref name="Hard Courts Make Tennis Champions"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hard Courts Make Tennis Champions|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1912/11/03/100597217.pdf|newspaper=The New York Times|date=3 November 1912}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hard courts can vary in speed, though they are faster than clay but not as fast as grass courts. The quantity of sand added to the paint can greatly affect the rate at which the ball slows down.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tennisuniversal.com/Data/product_search_res.asp?SearchCateg=050206&amp;ProductCateg=0500&amp;SubCateg1=0502&amp;SubCateg2=050206This Tennis Universal] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716210537/http://www.tennisuniversal.com/Data/product_search_res.asp?SearchCateg=050206&amp;ProductCateg=0500&amp;SubCateg1=0502&amp;SubCateg2=050206This |date=16 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[US Open (Tennis)|US Open]] is played on [[DecoTurf]] while the [[Australian Open]] is played on [[Plexicushion]], both acrylic-topped hard court surfaces.

Historically for the [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slams]] hard courts have been used at the [[Australian Open]] since 1988 and the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] since 1978.

===Carpet courts===
{{Main|Carpet court}}
[[File:Field club tennis courts in central old part of Nicosia Republic of Cyprus.jpg|thumb|Artificial turf tennis courts in [[Nicosia]], [[Cyprus]]]]
"Carpet" in tennis means any removable court covering.&lt;ref name="ITF Surfaces"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itftennis.com/technical/facilities/facilities-guide/surface-descriptions.aspx|title=Surface Descriptions|website=itftennis.com|publisher=International Tennis Federation|accessdate=June 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indoor arenas store rolls of rubber-backed court surfacing and install it temporarily for tennis events, but they are not in use any more for professional events. A short [[pile (textile)|piled]] form of [[artificial turf]] infilled with sand is used for some outdoor courts, particularly in Asia. Carpet is generally a fast surface, faster than hardcourt, with low bounce.&lt;ref name="ITF Surfaces"/&gt;

Notable tennis tournaments previously held on carpet courts were the [[WCT Finals]], [[Paris Masters]], [[U.S. Pro Indoor]] and [[Kremlin Cup]]. Since 2009, their use has been discontinued on the top tier of the ATP. [[ATP Challenger Tour]] tournaments such as the [[Trofeo Città di Brescia]] still use carpet courts. The WTA Tour has one remaining carpet court event, the [[WTA International tournaments|International]]-level [[Tournoi de Québec]].

==Indoor courts==
Some tennis courts are indoor, which allows to play regardless of weather conditions and is more comfortable for spectators. Because of the lack of wind, gameplay is considerably different versus outdoor courts.

Any court surface may be used indoors. Hard courts&lt;ref name="Hard Courts Make Tennis Champions"/&gt; are most common indoors, as they are made with the most versatile materials and surface finishes. Clay courts are installed indoors with underground watering systems, and used mostly for [[Davis Cup]] matches. The conclusion of the [[Wimbledon Championships]], in 2012, was played on the lawn of [[Centre Court]] under the closed roof and artificial lights. The [[Halle Open]] has also seen a number of matches played on its grass court in the [[Gerry Weber Stadion]] with the roof closed. Carpet surfaces have been used both on the [[ATP World Tour]] and [[World Championship Tennis]] circuit, though no events currently use them. Historically, other surfaces have been used indoors such as hardwood at the defunct [[World Covered Court Championships]] and [[London Indoor Professional Championships]]. Currently, the [[ATP World Tour Finals]] event is the most important indoor tennis tournament.

==Terminology==
{{main|Glossary of tennis terms}}

Common tennis court terms:

* ''Advantage service box'' or ''ad court'': The receiver's left side service box, or the opponent's right for the server; significant as the receiving side for an advantage point.
* ''Alley'' or ''Tramlines'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/rules_and_equipment/4222680.stm | title=BBC Sports: Basic rules of tennis | accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lanes on each side of the singles court. These are only used when playing doubles.
* ''Back court'': The area between the baseline and the service line.
* ''Baseline'': The rearmost line of the court, furthest from and parallel to the net.
* ''Center service line'': The line dividing the two service boxes on each side.
* ''Center mark'': The 12-inch mark at the halfway point of the baseline used to distinguish the two halves (and service boxes) of a tennis court.
* ''Deuce service box'' or ''deuce court'': The receiver's right side service box, or the opponent's left for the server, significant as the receiving side for a deuce point.
* ''Service box'': The area on each side bounded by the singles sideline, the service line, and the net. There are left and right service boxes, separated by the center service line.
* ''Service line'': The line that is parallel to the net and is located between the baseline and the net. It marks the end of the service boxes.
* ''Side T'': The T shape formed by the service line and the singles sideline. There are four such side Ts, two on each side of the net.
* ''T'' or ''Middle T'': The T shape formed by the service line and the center service line.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1558">A '''victory jig''' or '''victory dance''' is a celebration of a victory or success with a dance, shuffle or body movement. It is most commonly used in sports. The term can be used approvingly or abusively.  A victory jig can be engaged in as a genuine celebration or as a means to humiliate or taunt an opponent.

==Examples==
* [[Touchdown celebration]], an example of a victory dance in American and Canadian football
* [[Gatorade shower]], another type of victory dance in American football
* [[Goal celebration]], an example of a victory dance in association football (soccer)

==Notable occurrences==
*The 25 February 1964 fight between [[Cassius Clay]] and [[Sonny Liston]] when Clay did a "Victory jig" to taunt his opponent in the ring.  See main article [[Ali versus Liston]].
*[[Unionism (Ireland)|Unionist]] politician [[David Trimble]]'s victory jig with [[Ian Paisley]] in [[Northern Ireland]] after the 12 July 1995 Drumcree March (Drumcree I).&lt;ref&gt;See comments on David Trimble's "Victory Jig" [http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2005/05/08/story4619.asp here] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060117165000/http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2005/05/08/story4619.asp |date=January 17, 2006 }}.

In sports, a '''winning percentage''' is the [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] of games or matches a team or individual has won. It is defined as wins divided by the total number of matches played (i.e. wins plus draws plus losses). A draw counts as a ½ win.

For example, if a team's season record is 30 wins and 20 losses, the winning percentage would be .600. If a team's season record is 30–15–5 (i.e. it has won thirty games, lost fifteen and tied five times), the five tie games are counted as 2½ wins, and so the team has an adjusted record of 32½ wins, resulting in a {{winpct|30|15|5}} winning percentage for the fifty total games from

: &lt;math&gt;\text{winning percentage} = {\text{wins}+0.5\cdot\text{ties}\over\text{total games}}\cdot100\%&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;65\% = {32.5\over50}\cdot100\%&lt;/math&gt;

Winning percentage is one way to compare the record of two teams; however, another standard method most frequently used in [[baseball]] and professional [[basketball]] standings is [[games behind]]. In [[baseball]], a [[pitcher]] is assessed wins and losses as an individual [[statistic]] and thus has his own winning percentage, based on his [[win–loss record (pitching)|win–loss record]].

In North America, winning percentages are expressed to three digits and read as whole numbers (e.g. 1.000, "a thousand" or .500, "five hundred"). In this case, the name "winning ''percentage''" is actually a misnomer, since it is not expressed as a [[percentage]]. A winning percentage such as .536 ("five thirty-six") expressed as a percentage would be 53.6%.{{anchor|500}}

However, in [[soccer]], a [[manager (football)|manager]]'s abilities may be measured by win percentage. In this case, the formula is wins divided by total number of matches; draws are not considered as "half-wins", and the quotient is always in percentage form.

In the [[National Football League]], division winners and playoff qualifiers are technically determined by winning percentage and not by number of wins. Ties are currently counted as half a win and half a loss, however, prior to 1972 ties did not count for the purposes of this calculation. So, for example, one team finished 11-3 and another 10-2-2, there would have been no tiebreaker - the team with two ties would have been deemed the outright division winner. This made tie games (a fairly common occurrence in football before [[overtime (sports)|overtime]] was introduced) somewhat more valuable to teams compared to the half-win they are considered today. 

Some leagues and competitions may instead use a [[points percentage]] system, changing the nature of this statistic. In this type of method, used in many [[group tournament ranking system]]s, the competitors are awarded a certain number of points per win, fewer points per tie, and none for a loss. The teams are then ranked by the total number of these accumulated points. One such method is the "[[three points for a win]]", where three points are awarded for winning a game, one point is awarded for a draw, and no points are awarded for a loss. The [[National Hockey League]] (which uses an [[Overtime (ice hockey)|overtime and shootout]]s to break all ties) awards two points for a win in regulation or overtime/shootout, one point for an overtime loss, and none for a regulation loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Career Leaders and Records for Points Percentage (Goalie) |url= https://www.hockey-reference.com/leaders/points_pct_goalie_career.html |publisher= Hockey-Reference.com |accessdate= 24 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= 2008–2009&amp;nbsp;– REGULAR SEASON&amp;nbsp;– SUMMARY&amp;nbsp;– POINT PERCENTAGE |url= http://www.nhl.com/ice/teamstats.htm?fetchKey=20092ALLAAAAll&amp;sort=pointPctg&amp;viewName=summary |publisher= NHL.com |accessdate= 24 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
