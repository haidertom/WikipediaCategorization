'''21st century skills''' comprise [[higher-order thinking|skills]], [[aptitude|abilities]], and learning [[disposition|dispositions]] that have been identified as being required for [[achieved status|success]] in 21st century society and workplaces by educators, business leaders, [[faculty (academic staff)|academics]], and [[government agency|governmental agencies]].  This is part of a growing international movement focusing on the skills required for students to master in preparation for success in a rapidly changing, [[information society|digital society]].  Many of these skills are also associated with [[Deeper Learning|deeper learning]], which is based on mastering skills such as [[analytic reasoning]], complex [[problem solving]], and [[teamwork]].  These skills differ from traditional academic skills in that they are not primarily content knowledge-based.&lt;ref name="Dede"&gt;[http://sttechnology.pbworks.com/f/Dede_(2010)_Comparing%20Frameworks%20for%2021st%20Century%20Skills.pdf Chris Dede, Comparing Frameworks for 21st Century Skills, Harvard Graduate School of Education, 2009].

During the latter decades of the 20th century and into the 21st century, [[society]] has undergone an accelerating pace of change in [[economy]] and [[technology]].  Its effects on the [[workplace]], and thus on the demands on the educational system preparing students for the [[workforce]], have been significant in several ways.  Beginning in the 1980s, government, educators, and major employers issued a series of reports identifying key skills and implementation strategies to steer students and workers towards meeting the demands of the changing workplace and society.

The current workforce is significantly more likely to change career fields or jobs.  Those in the [[Baby boomers|Baby Boom]] generation entered the workforce with a goal of stability; subsequent generations are more concerned with finding [[eudaimonia|happiness]] and fulfillment in their work lives.  Young workers in North America are now likely to change jobs at a much higher rate than previously, as much as once every 4.4 years on average.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeannemeister/2012/08/14/job-hopping-is-the-new-normal-for-millennials-three-ways-to-prevent-a-human-resource-nightmare/#1cb0e4da5508 ''Job-hopping is the new normal for millennials'', Forbes Magazine, August 14, 2012].

Many of these skills are also identified as key qualities of [[progressive education]], a pedagogical movement that began in the late nineteenth century and continues in various forms to the present.

==Background==
Since the early 1980s, a variety of governmental, academic, non-profit, and corporate entities have conducted considerable research to identify key personal and academic skills and competencies they determined were needed for the current and next generation.  The identification and implementation of 21st century skills into education and workplaces began in the United States but has spread to Canada,&lt;ref&gt;[https://c21parentguide.wordpress.com C21 - A Parent's Guide to 21st century learning].

In 1981, the US Secretary of Education created the [[National Commission on Excellence in Education]] to examine the quality of education in the United States."&lt;ref name="Nation1"&gt;[http://www2.ed.gov/pubs/NatAtRisk/intro.html Nation at Risk, introduction] Retrieved 2016-03-09&lt;/ref&gt;  The commission issued its report ''[[A Nation at Risk|A Nation at Risk: The Imperative for Educational Reform]]'' in 1983.

Until the dawn of the 21st century, education systems across the world focussed on preparing their students to accumulate content and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Care|first1=Esther|title=How Education Systems Approach Breadth of Skills|url=https://www.brookings.edu/research/how-education-systems-approach-breadth-of-skills/.|website=Brookings|publisher=Brookings}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, schools focussed on providing literacy and numeracy skills to their students, as these skills were perceived as necessary to gain content and knowledge. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Care|first1=Esther|title=How Education Systems Approach Breadth of Skills|url=https://www.brookings.edu/research/how-education-systems-approach-breadth-of-skills/.|website=Brookings|publisher=Brookings}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent developments in technology and telecommunication have made information and knowledge ubiquitous and easily accessible in the 21st century. Therefore, while skills such as literacy and numeracy are still relevant and necessary, they are no longer sufficient. In order to respond to technological, demographic and socio-economic changes, education systems began to make the shift toward providing their students with a range of skills that relied not only on cognition but also on the interdependencies of cognitive, social, and emotional characteristics. &lt;ref&gt;Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee, The Second Machine Age: Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies (W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;  

Notable efforts were conducted by the US Secretary of Labor's Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills (SCANS), a national coalition called the Partnership for 21st Century Skills (P21), the international [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]], the American Association of College and Universities, researchers at [[MIT]] and other institutions of higher learning, and private organizations.

Additional research has found that the top skills demanded by U.S. [[Fortune 500]] companies by the year 2000 had shifted from traditional reading, writing and arithmetic to teamwork, problem solving, and interpersonal skills.&lt;ref name="Cassel &amp; Kolstad"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cassel|first1=R.N.|last2=Kolstad|first2=R.|title=The critical job-skills requirements for the 21st century: Living and working with people|journal=Journal of Instructional Psychology|date=1998|volume=25|issue=3|pages=176–180}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2006 [[Conference Board]] survey of some 400 employers revealed that the most important skills for new workforce entrants included oral and written communications and critical thinking/problem solving, ahead of basic knowledge and skills, such as the reading comprehension and mathematics.  While the [[The three Rs|‘three Rs’]] were still considered foundational to new workforce entrants’ abilities, employers emphasized that applied skills like collaboration/teamwork and critical thinking were ‘very important’ to success at work."&lt;ref name="Conference Board"&gt;{{cite book|title=Are They Ready to Work?

A 2006 report from MIT researchers countered the suggestion that students acquire critical skills and competencies independently by interacting with popular culture, noting three continuing trends that suggest the need for policy and pedagogical interventions:"&lt;ref name="Jenkins"&gt;[http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED536086.pdf Jenkins].

*The Ethics Challenge — The breakdown of traditional forms of professional training and socialization that might prepare young people for their increasingly public roles as media makers and community participants."

According to labor economists at [[MIT]] and [[Harvard University|Harvard’s Graduate School of Education]], the economic changes brought about over the past four decades by emerging technology and [[globalization]], employers’ demands for people with competencies like complex thinking and communications skills has increased greatly.&lt;ref name="Murnane &amp; Levy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murnane|first1=Richard J.|last2=Levy|first2=Frank|title=Teaching the New Basic Skills: Principles for Educating Children to Thrive in a Changing Economy|date=1996|publisher=Free Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They argue that the success of the U.S. economy will rely on the nation’s ability to give students the "foundational skills in problem-solving and communications that computers don’t have."&lt;ref name="Levy &amp; Murnane"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Levy|first1=Frank|last2=Murnane|first2=Richard|title=Dancing with Robots: Human Skills for Computerized Work|publisher=Third Way|url=http://content.thirdway.org/publications/714/Dancing-With-Robots.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the [[Common Core State Standards Initiative]], an effort sponsored by the [[National Governors Association]] (NGA) and the [[Council of Chief State School Officers]] (CCSSO),   issued the [[Common Core Standards]], calling for the integration of 21st century skills into K-12 curricula across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Common Core State Standards Initiative |url=http://www.corestandards.org/resources/frequently-asked-questions |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The skills==
The skills and competencies that are generally considered "21st Century skills" are varied but share some common themes.  They are based on the premise that effective learning, or [[Deeper Learning|deeper learning]], a set of student educational outcomes including acquisition of robust core academic content, higher-order thinking skills, and learning dispositions.  This [[pedagogy]] involves creating, working with others, analyzing, and presenting and sharing both the learning experience and the learned knowledge or wisdom, including to peers and mentors as well as teachers.  This contrasts with more traditional learning methodology that involves learning by rote and regurgitating info/knowledge back to the teacher for a grade. The skills are geared towards students and workers to foster engagement; seeking, forging, and facilitating connections to knowledge, ideas, peers, instructors, and wider audiences; creating/producing; and presenting/publishing.  The classification or grouping has been undertaken to encourage and promote pedagogies that facilitate deeper learning through both traditional instruction as well as [[active learning]], [[project-based learning]], [[problem based learning]], and others.  A 2012 survey conducted by the [[American Management Association]] (AMA) identified three top skills necessary for their employees: [[critical thinking]], communication and collaboration.&lt;ref name="Critical Skills Survey"&gt;{{cite book|title=Critical Skills Survey|date=2012|publisher=American Management Association|location=New York|url=http://playbook.amanet.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/2012-Critical-Skills-Survey-pdf.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Below are some of the more readily identifiable lists of 21st century skills.

===SCANS===
Following the release of ''A Nation at Risk'', the U.S. [[Secretary of Labor]] appointed the '''Secretary's Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills (SCANS)''' to determine the skills needed for young people to succeed in the workplace to foster a high-performance economy.  SCANS focused on what they called "learning a living" system. In 1991, they issued their initial report, ''What Work Requires of Schools''.  The report concluded that a high-performance workplace requires workers who have key fundamental skills:  basic skills and knowledge, thinking skills to apply that knowledge, personal skills to manage and perform; and five key workplace competencies.&lt;ref name="SCANS"&gt;[http://www.academicinnovations.com/report.html SCANS report 1991].  Retrieved 2016-03-08&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fundamental Skills'''
*Basic Skills:  ''reads, writes, performs arithmetic and mathematical operations, listens and speaks.''
*Thinking Skills:  ''thinks creatively, makes decisions, solves problems, visualizes, knows how to learn, and reasons''
*Personal Qualities:  ''displays responsibility, self-esteem, sociability, self-management, and integrity and honesty''

'''Workplace Competencies'''
*Resources:  ''identifies, organizes, plans, and allocates resources''
*Interpersonal:  ''works with others (participates as member of a team, teaches others new skills, serves clients/customers, exercises leadership, negotiates, works with diversity'')
*Information:  ''acquires and uses information (acquires and evaluates, organizes and maintains, and interprets and communicates information; uses computers to process information'')
*Systems:  ''understands complex inter-relationships (understands systems, monitors and corrects performance, improves or designs systems)''
*Technology:  ''works with a variety of technologies (selects technology, applies technology to task, maintains and troubleshoots equipment)''

===Partnership for 21st Century Skills (P21)===
In 2002 the Partnership for 21st Century Skills (now the Partnership for 21st Century Learning, or '''P21''') was founded as a [[non-profit]] organization by a coalition that included members of the national business community, education leaders, and policymakers:  the [[National Education Association]] (NEA), [[United States Department of Education]], [[AOL Time-Warner|AOL Time Warner Foundation]], [[Apple Computer, Inc.]], [[Cable in the Classroom]], [[Cisco Systems, Inc.]], [[Dell Computer Corporation]], [[Microsoft Corporation]], [[SAP SE|SAP]], Ken Kay (President and Co-Founder), and Dins Golder-Dardis.&lt;ref name="P21history"&gt;[http://www.p21.org/about-us/our-history P21 Our History].

{{main article|Participatory culture}}
Researchers at MIT, led by [[Henry Jenkins]], Director of the Comparative Media Studies Program, in 2006 issued a white paper ("Confronting the Challenges of a Participatory Culture:  Media Education for the 21st Century"), that examined digital media and learning.&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt;  To address this [[Digital Divide]], they recommended an effort be made to develop the cultural competencies and social skills required to participate fully in modern society instead of merely advocating for installing computers in each classroom.&lt;ref name="Jenkins3"&gt;[http://www.newmedialiteracies.org/ New Media Literacies webpage].  Retrieved 2016-03-08&lt;/ref&gt; What they term [[participatory culture]] shifts this literacy from the individual level to a broader connection and involvement, with the premise that networking and collaboration develop social skills that are vital to new literacies.  These in turn build on traditional foundation skills and knowledge taught in school:  traditional literacy, research, technical, and critical analysis skills.

Participatory culture is defined by this study as having: low barriers to artistic expression and civic engagement, strong support for creating and sharing one’s creations, informal mentorship, belief that members' own contributions matter, and social connection (caring what other people think about their creations).&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt;
Forms of participatory culture include:&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt;
*Affiliations — ''memberships, formal and informal, in online communities centered around various forms of media, such as message boards, metagaming, game clans, and other social media).''
*Expressions — ''producing new creative forms, such as digital sampling, [[Skin (computing)|skinning]] and [[modding]], fan videomaking, fan fiction writing, [[zines]], [[mash-ups]].''
*Collaborative Problem-solving — ''working together in teams, formal and informal, to complete tasks and develop new knowledge (such as through Wikipedia, alternative reality gaming, spoiling).''
*Circulations — ''shaping the flow of media (such as [[podcasting]], [[blogging]])''.

The skills identified were:&lt;ref name="Dede"/&gt;
*Play 
*Simulation 
*Appropriation
*Multitasking
*Distributed Cognition 
*Collective Intelligence
*Judgment
*Transmedia Navigation

===EnGauge 21st century skills===
In 2003 the North Central Regional Educational Laboratory and the Metiri Group issued a report entitled "enGauge® 21st Century Skills: Literacy in the Digital Age" based on two years of research.  The report called for policymakers and educators to define 21st century skills, highlight the relationship of those skills to conventional academic standards, and recognize the need for multiple assessments to measure and evaluate these skills within the context of academic standards and the current technological and global society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pict.sdsu.edu/engauge21st.pdf enGauge 21st Century Skills].  Retrieved 2016-03-08&lt;/ref&gt;  To provide a common understanding of, and language for discussing, the needs of students, citizens, and workers in a modern digital society, the report identified four "skill clusters":
*Digital-Age Literacy
*Inventive Thinking
*Effective Communication
*High Productivity

===OECD competencies===
In 1997, member countries of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] launched the [[Programme for International Student Assessment]] (PISA) to monitor "the extent to which students near the end of compulsory schooling have acquired the knowledge and skills essential for full participation in society".&lt;ref name="OECD"&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/pisa/35070367.pdf ''The Definition and Selection of Key Competencies'', OECD, 2005].  Retrieved 2016-03-08&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005 they identified three "Competency Categories:" 
*Using Tools Interactively
*Interacting in Heterogeneous Groups
*Acting Autonomously

===American Association of College and Universities===
The AAC&amp;U conducted several studies and surveys of their members.  In 2007 they recommended that graduates of higher education attain four skills - '''The Essential Learning Outcomes:'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://209.29.151.145/about/membership/surveytalkingpoints ''Talking Points: AAC&amp;U 2009 Member Survey Findings''] .  Retrieved 2016-03-10&lt;/ref&gt;
*Knowledge of Human Cultures and the Physical and Natural World
*Intellectual and Practical Skills
*Personal and Social Responsibility
*Integrative Learning

They found that skills most widely addressed in college and university goals are:&lt;ref&gt;[http://209.29.151.145/sites/default/files/files/LEAP/2015_Survey_Report2_GEtrends.pdf AAC&amp;U - ''Recent Trends in General Education Design, Learning Outcomes, and Teaching Approaches'', 2015].  Retrieved 2016-03-10&lt;/ref&gt;
*writing
*critical thinking
*quantitative reasoning
*oral communication
*intercultural skills
*information literacy
*ethical reasoning

A 2015 survey of AAC&amp;U member institutions added the following goals:
*analytic reasoning
*research skills and projects 
*integration of learning across disciplines 
*application of learning beyond the classroom 
*civic engagement and competence

===ISTE / NETS performance standards===
The '''ISTE Educational Technology Standards''' (formerly '''[[National Educational Technology Standards]] (NETS)''') are a set of standards published by the [[International Society for Technology in Education]] (ISTE) to leverage the use of technology in [[K-12 education]].&lt;ref&gt;NETS Project(2007). National Educational Technology Standards for Students. ISTE. {{ISBN|978-1-56484-237-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ISTE"&gt;[http://www.iste.org/standards/iste-standards/standards-for-students ISTE Standards for Students].  Retrieved 2016-03-09&lt;/ref&gt;  These are sometimes intermixed with information and communication technologies (ICT) skills.  In 2007 NETS issued a series of six performance indicators (only the first four are on their website as of 2016):

*Creativity and Innovation
*Communication and Collaboration
*Research and Information Fluency
*Critical Thinking, Problem Solving, and Decision Making
*Digital Citizenship
*Technology Operations and Concepts

===ICT Literacy Panel digital literacy standards (2007)===
In 2007 the [[Educational Testing Service]] (ETS) ICT Literacy Panel released its digital literacy standards:&lt;ref name="ETS"&gt;[https://www.ets.org/Media/Tests/Information_and_Communication_Technology_Literacy/ictreport.pdf ''Digital Transformation - A Framework for ICT Literacy.'' International ICT Literacy Panel. 2007].  Retrieved 2016-03-08&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[Information and Communication Technologies|Information and Communication Technologies (ICT)]] proficiencies:
*Cognitive proficiency
*Technical proficiency
*ICT proficiency

A person possessing these skills would be expected to perform these tasks for a particular set of information:  access, manage, integrate, evaluate, create/publish/present.  The emphasis is on proficiency with digital tools.&lt;ref name="ETS"/&gt;

===Dede learning styles and categories===
In 2005, Chris Dede of the Harvard Graduate School of Education developed a framework based on new digital literacies entitled&lt;br /&gt;
'''Neomillennial Learning Styles''':&lt;ref name="Dede"/&gt;
*Fluency in multiple media
*Active learning based on collectively seeking, sieving, and synthesizing experiences.
*Expression through non-linear, associational webs of representations.
*Co-design by teachers and students of personalized learning experiences.

'''Dede category system'''&lt;br /&gt;
With the exponential expansion of personal access to Internet resources, including social media, information and content on the Internet has evolved from being created by website providers to individuals and communities of contributors.  The 21st century Internet centered on material created by a small number of people, [[Web 2.0]] tools (e.g. Wikipedia) foster online communication, collaboration, and creation of content by large numbers of people (individually or in groups) in online communities.&lt;ref name="Dede"/&gt;

In 2009, Dede created a category system for Web 2.0 tools:&lt;ref name="Dede"/&gt; 
*Sharing (communal bookmarking, photo/video sharing, social networking, writers’ workshops/fanfiction)
*Thinking (blogs, podcasts, online discussion fora)
*Co-Creating (wikis/collaborative file creation, mashups/collective media creation, collaborative social change communities)

===World Economic Forum===

In 2015, the World Economic Forum published a report titled ‘New Vision for Education: Unlocking the Potential of Technology’ &lt;ref&gt;http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEFUSA_NewVisionforEducation_Report2015.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; that focused on the pressing issue of the 21st-century skills gap and ways to address it through technology. In the report, they defined a set of 16 crucial proficiencies for education in the 21st century. Those skills include six “foundational literacies”, four “competencies” and six “character qualities” listed below.

'''Foundation Literacies'''
*Literacy and numeracy
*Scientific literacy
*ICT literacy
*Financial literacy
*Cultural literacy
*Civic literacy

'''Competencies'''

*Critical thinking/problem solving
*Communication
*Collaboration

'''Character Qualities'''
*Creativity 
*Initiative 
*Persistence/grit
*Adaptability
*Curiosity
*Leadership
*Social and cultural awareness

===National Research Council===

In a paper titled ‘Education for Life and Work: Developing Transferable Knowledge and Skills in the 21st Century’ &lt;ref&gt;http://www.leg.state.vt.us/WorkGroups/EdOp/Education%20for%20Life%20and%20Work-%20National%20Academy%20of%20Sciences.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; produced by the National Research Council of National Academies, the National Research defines 21st century skills, describes how the skills relate to each other and summaries the evidence regarding 21st century skills. 

As a first step toward describing “21st century skills,” the National Research Council identified three domains of competence: cognitive, interpersonal, and intrapersonal while recognizing that the three domains while different, are intertwined in human development and learning. These three domains represent distinct facets of human thinking and build on previous efforts to identify and organize dimensions of human behaviour. The committee produced the following cluster of 21st century skills in the above mentioned 3 domains. 

'''Cognitive Competencies'''

*Cognitive processes and strategies: Critical thinking, problem solving, analysis, reasoning and argumentation, interpretation, decision-making, adaptive learning
*Knowledge: Information literacy, ICT literacy, oral and written communication, and active listening
*Creativity: Creativity and innovation

'''Intrapersonal Competencies'''

*Intellectual openness: Flexibility, adaptability, artistic and cultural appreciation, personal and social responsibility, appreciation for diversity, adaptability, continuous learning, intellectual interest and curiosity
*Work ethic/conscientiousness: Initiative, self-direction, responsibility, perseverance, grit, career orientation, ethics, integrity, citizenship
*Positive core self-evaluation: Self monitoring, self evaluation, self reinforcement, physical and psychological health

'''Interpersonal Competencies'''

*Teamwork and collaboration: Communication, collaboration, cooperation, teamwork, coordination, interpersonal skills
*Leadership: Responsibility, assertive communication, self presentation, social influence with others

==Implementation==
Multiple agencies and organizations have issued guides and recommendation for implementation of 21st century skills in a variety of [[learning environment]]s and [[learning space]]s.  These include five separate educational areas: standards, assessment, professional development, curriculum &amp; instruction, and learning environments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.p21.org/storage/documents/p21-stateimp_curriculuminstruction.pdf P21 implementation guide].  Retrieved 2016-03-09&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hanoverresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Best-Practices-in-Implementing-21st-Century-Skills-Initiatives-Membership.pdf Hanover Research, Best Practices in Implementing 21st Century Skills Initiatives].  Retrieved 2016-03-11&lt;/ref&gt;

The designs of learning environments and curricula have been impacted by the initiatives and efforts to implement and support 21st century skills with a move away from the [[Factory model school|factory model school model]] and into a variety of different [[school organizational models|organizational models]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nea.org/home/46989.htm NEA 21st-Century Learner, summer 2011].

Retrieved 2016-03-11&lt;/ref&gt;  Hands-on learning project-based learning have resulted in the development of programs and spaces such as [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] and [[makerspaces]].  Collaborative learning environments have fostered flexibility in furniture and classroom layout as well as differentiated spaces, such as small seminar rooms near classrooms.  Literacy with, and access to, digital technology has impacted the design of furniture and fixed components as students and teachers use tablets, [[interactive whiteboard]]s and interactive projectors.  Classroom sizes have grown to accommodate a variety of furniture arrangements and grouping, many of which are less space-efficient than traditional configurations of desks in rows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bobpearlman.org/Articles/ET%20Bob%20Pearlman%20article.pdf ''Making 21st Century Schools - Creating Learner-Centered Schoolplaces/Workplaces for a New Culture of Students at Work'', Bob Pearlman, EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY/September–October 2009].

'''Academic program prioritization''' is the activity or process in which an [[academic institution]] assesses and prioritizes its programs for the purpose of more strategically allocating its funding and resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.d.umn.edu/vcaa/program_prioritization.html Program prioritization homepage at the University of Minnesota Duluth]&lt;/ref&gt; This is a process a school engages in when it intends to make systematic changes. For instance, [[Boise State University]] underwent a yearlong process of exploring and assessing its programs with the intention of making the university more focused and more aligned with the needs of its students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://president.boisestate.edu/prioritization/ Program prioritization homepage at Boise State University]&lt;/ref&gt;

Program prioritization is similar to [[program evaluation]] but differs in that it not only involves evaluating programs but also involves making financial decisions concerning program funding. Program prioritization can be a significant issue, having the potential to affect the lives and goals of both students and faculty.  This page deals with program prioritization in the context of [[higher education]], and it attempts to provide a basic description of what this entails.

==General description==

A school engaged in the process of prioritizing its programs may decide to either increase, decrease, continue, or discontinue the funding for particular programs, leading to these programs being either expanded, downsized, unchanged, or discontinued entirely. For example, in 2013, [[Western Carolina University]] announced that after a process of program prioritization it would discontinue several programs including a bachelor’s in [[Germans studies|German]], a minor in [[women’s studies]], as well master’s programs in [[music]], [[health sciences]], [[English studies|English]], and [[mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;"Belcher announces program cuts, 3 programs saved", News page, Western Carolinian University [http://www.westerncarolinian.com/news/belcher-announces-program-cuts-3-programs-saved-1.3048901#.Uw49fPldUuc]&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Programs are generally prioritized on the basis of their student populations and potential to attract new students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indstate.edu/academicaffairs/program_prioritization.htm Program prioritization homepage, Indiana State University]&lt;/ref&gt; Though, other factors may also weigh in on the likelihood of a program being downsized or discontinued, such as its overall cost for the university.

==Causes==

Prioritization of programs and reallocation of funding are usually necessitated by the combination of two factors: 1) A school’s desire to develop and expand, and 2) limited funding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2010/11/11/priorities "The Pressure to Prioritize", Inside Higher Ed]&lt;/ref&gt; If a school wants to grow and expand its programs, but doesn’t possess the resources to develop each program equally, prioritization may become necessary. Schools are under pressure to expand and therefore they are going to be under pressure to reallocate funding towards more successful programs.&lt;ref&gt;Dickeson, Robert C., 2010,"Prioritizing Academic Programs and Services: Reallocating Resources to Achieve Strategic Balance" [https://www.amazon.com/Prioritizing-Academic-Programs-Services-Reallocating/dp/0470559683]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Adventures of the Mind''' is an achievement-focused mentoring camp for talented high school students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/06/24/137397953/top-students-converge-at-mind-summit-in-montana|title=Top Students Converge at Mind Summit in Montana|website=NPR.org|access-date=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Educators from across the nation nominate students whom they believe, with guidance and nurture, can maximize their potential and make important contributions to society. Honored guests share their life stories that can serve as a road map to the students on their own personal paths to success.

==History==
Founded in 2003, the ''Adventures of the Mind'' achievement mentoring camp brings together, on a college campus, high potential teens from across the country with accomplished mentors from a variety of fields: artists, astronauts, athletes, entrepreneurs, inventors, journalists, [[Nobel laureates]], novelists, poets, poker players, programmers, public servants, [[Pulitzer prize]] winners, scholars, and more. Adventures of the Mind provides the students — who are the great thinker and achievers of tomorrow — with an opportunity to interact with some of the great thinkers and achievers of today. The camp runs for 7 days and is developed by student achievement and advocacy services. [[Murray Gell-Mann]] who was awarded the 1969 Nobel Prize in Physics and a Mentor at the 2011 summit, is quoted as saying:

==Student selection process==
Student attendees are selected through a highly personalized and rigorous search that goes beyond traditional measures of achievement — grades and test scores — by asking teachers to personally nominate an exceptional teen. Attendees are chosen regardless of learning disabilities, socioeconomic factors, or other obstacles that may obscure real potential. Additionally, participants are chosen from runners-up in national competitions ranging from the [[Presidential Scholars Program]] to the [[Intel Science Talent Search]] to the [[National Poetry Slam]]. ''Adventures of the Mind'' targets high potential students who may not yet garner the same level of recognition as their peers, but would benefit just as much from the experience the camp provides.

==Mentors==
Mentors represent a wide variety of backgrounds and fields including arts, business, literature, public service, philanthropy, science and more.

'''All About Us: Living and Growing''' is a British [[Sex and Relationships Education]] series for 5–13 year olds published by [[Channel 4]] on [[VHS]] and [[DVD]]. The series is often referred to by its short name of ''Living and Growing''. It covers the differences between a boy and a girl, [[Puberty]], how babies are made and how babies are born. The programmes were put into units 1, 2, 3 and 4.

In the first three units the programme includes gently introducing sex education to younger children, through puberty and birth, to media images, same-sex relationships and teenage pregnancy. The fourth unit covers puberty and body image in more detail with a focus on maintaining a healthy mind and body

Unit 1 - Age 5-7
Differences | How did I get here? | Growing up

Unit 2 - Age 7-9
Changes | How babies are made | How babies are born

Unit 3 - Age 9-11
Girl talk | Boy talk | Let's talk about sex

Unit 4 - Age 11-13
Puberty | Body image | Making the right choices

As of July 7, 2012, the DVDs were removed from the Channel 4 product catalogue as a result of the Government’s announcement that the PSHE curriculum is under review. The Alternative version, featuring the first three units, was released in 2013 as the review had not taken place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alternative version listing|url=https://shop.channel4learning.com/?page=shop&amp;pid=26651|website=Channel 4 Shop|accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Alternative version Girl Talk and Boy Talk were moved to Unit 2 which now focuses mainly on puberty. How babies are made and How babies are born took their place in Unit 3 and the Let's talk about sex episode was dropped.

==Controversy==

The program has come under scrutiny by parents because of its graphic depictions of sexual intercourse and foreplay in Unit 2, in which, among other scenes, it "shows a naked cartoon couple pillow fighting before having sexual intercourse in several positions, as a narrator describes sex and its physical changes as "fun and very exciting".&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Kathleen (2011-07-08) [http://www.lifesitenews.com/news/graphic-sex-ed-program-for-kids-to-stay-in-compulsory-science-classes-uk-of Graphic sex-ed program for kids can stay in compulsory science classes: UK official], ''Lifesitenews.com''&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Alternative version removed some of more explicit content concerns have still been expressed and it has been noted that the worksheets remain unchanged and the original DVDs were not recalled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alternative version review|url=https://www.spuc.org.uk/campaigns/safeatschool/livingandgrowingalternative|website=Society for the Protection of Unborn Children|accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of '''ancient higher-learning institutions''' were developed in many cultures to provide institutional frameworks for scholarly activities. These ancient centres were sponsored and overseen by courts; by religious institutions, which sponsored [[Cathedral school#Early schools|cathedral schools]], [[monastic schools]], and [[Madrasah#Higher education|madrasas]]; by scientific institutions, such as  museums, hospitals, and observatories; and by individual scholars.  They are to be distinguished from the [[Western world|Western]]-style [[university]], an autonomous organization of scholars that originated in [[medieval Europe]]&lt;ref&gt;Stephen C.

Around 335 BC, Plato's successor [[Aristotle]] founded the [[Peripatetic school]], the students of which met at the [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lyceum]] gymnasium in Athens. The school ceased in 86 BC during the famine, siege and sacking of Athens by [[Sulla]].&lt;ref&gt;336 BC: {{Harvnb|Furley|2003a|p=1141}}; 335 BC: {{Harvnb|Lynch|1997|p=311}}; 334 BC: {{Harvnb|Irwin|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Hellenistic period]], the [[Museion]] in [[Alexandria]] (which included the [[Library of Alexandria]]) became the leading research institute for science and technology from which many Greek innovations sprang. The engineer [[Ctesibius]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 285–222 BC) may have been its first head. It was suppressed and burned between AD 216 and 272, and the library was destroyed between 272 and 391.

The reputation of these Greek institutions was such that at least four central modern educational terms derive from them: the [[academy]], the [[lyceum]], the [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] and the [[museum]].

The [[Pandidakterion]] of [[Constantinople]], founded as an institution of higher learning in 425, educated graduates to take on posts of authority in the imperial service or within the Church.&lt;ref name="jeffreys"&gt;{{cite book| last = Constantinides| first = C.

If a university is defined as "an institution of higher learning" then it is preceded by several others, including the Academy that it was founded to compete with and eventually replaced. If the original meaning of the word is considered "a corporation of students" then this could be the first example of such an institution.  The [[Preslav Literary School]] and [[Ohrid Literary School]] were the two major literary schools of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]].

In Western Europe during the [[Early Middle Ages]], [[bishops]] sponsored [[cathedral school]]s and [[monasteries]] sponsored [[monastic school]]s, chiefly dedicated to the education of [[clergy]]. The earliest evidence of a European episcopal school is that established in [[Visigothic]] Spain at the [[Councils of Toledo|Second Council of Toledo]] in 527.&lt;ref&gt;Riché, ''Education and Culture'', pp. 126-7.&lt;/ref&gt;  These early episcopal schools, with a focus on an apprenticeship in religious learning under a scholarly bishop, have been identified in Spain and in about twenty towns in Gaul during the 6th and 7th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Riché, ''Education and Culture'', pp. 282-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these episcopal schools, there were monastic schools which educated monks and nuns, as well as future bishops, at a more advanced level.&lt;ref&gt;Riché, ''Education and Culture'', pp. 290-8.&lt;/ref&gt;  Around the turn of the 12th and 13th centuries, some of them developed into autonomous universities.  A notable example is when the [[University of Paris#The original schools|University of Paris]] grew out of the schools associated with the [[Cathedral of Notre Dame]], the [[Abbey of St Genevieve|Monastery of Ste. Geneviève]], and the [[Abbey of St. Victor, Paris|Abbey of St. Victor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Pedersen| first = Olaf| title = The First Universities: Studium Generale and the Origins of University Education in Europe| year = 1997| isbn = 978-0-521-59431-8| pages = 130–31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The rise of universities| year = 1957| publisher = Cornell University Press| isbn = 978-0-8014-9015-6| pages = 12–16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indian subcontinent==
Major Buddhist monasteries (''[[mahavihara]]s''), notably those at [[Pushpagiri Vihara|Pushpagiri]], [[Nalanda]], and [[Taxila (ancient)|Taxila]], included schools that were some of the primary institutions of higher learning in [[ancient India]].

===Pushpagiri===
[[Image:Udayagiri WIKI.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Udayagiri, Odisha]] Part of [[Pushpagiri Vihara|Pushpagiri]]]]
The school in [[Pushpagiri Vihara|Pushpagiri]] was established in the 3rd century AD as present [[Odisha]], India. As of 2007, the ruins of this Mahavihara had not yet been fully excavated. Consequently, much of the Mahavihara's history remains unknown. Of the three Mahavihara campuses, Lalitgiri in the district of Cuttack is the oldest. Iconographic analysis indicates that Lalitgiri had already been established during the [[Shunga Empire|Shunga]] period of the 2nd century BC, making it one of the oldest Buddhist establishments in the world. The Chinese traveller [[Xuanzang]] (Hiuen Tsang), who visited it in AD 639, as ''Puphagiri Mahavihara'',&lt;ref name="Misra1986"&gt;{{cite book|author=Binayak Misra|title=Indian culture and cult of Jagannātha|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BvYdAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=3 July 2012|year=1986|publisher=Punthi Pustak}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Nalanda===

[[Nalanda]] was established in the fifth century AD in [[Bihar (India)|Bihar]], [[India]]&lt;ref&gt;Altekar, Anant Sadashiv (1965). Education in Ancient India, Sixth, Varanasi: Nand Kishore &amp; Bros.&lt;/ref&gt; and survived until circa 1200 AD. It was devoted to Buddhist studies, but it also trained students in fine arts, medicine, mathematics, astronomy, politics and the art of war.&lt;ref name="Nalanda University, as described by the dean of Yale school of management"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/09/opinion/09garten.htm OpEd in New York Times: Nalanda University]&lt;/ref&gt;

The center had eight separate compounds, ten temples, meditation halls, classrooms, lakes and parks. It had a nine-story library where monks meticulously copied books and documents so that individual scholars could have their own collections. It had dormitories for students, housing 10,000 students in the school’s heyday and providing accommodation for 2,000 professors.&lt;ref name="Nalanda"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://nalanda.ind.in/index.html |title=Official website of Nalanda University |access-date=20 December 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316100842/http://nalanda.ind.in/index.html |archive-date=16 March 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nalanda attracted pupils and scholars from Sri Lanka, Korea, Japan, China, Tibet, Indonesia, Persia and Turkey, who left accounts of the center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History and Revival|url=https://www.nalandauniv.edu.in/about-nalanda/history-and-revival/|website=Nalanda University|accessdate=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 a modern [[Nalanda University]] was launched in nearby [[Rajgir]].

===Taxila===
[[Taxila (ancient)|Ancient Taxila]] or Takshashila, in ancient [[Gandhara]] (modern-day [[Pakistan]]), was an early Hindu and Buddhist centre of learning. According to scattered references that were only fixed a millennium later, it may have dated back to at least the fifth century BC.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Scharfe| first1 = Hartmut| last2 = Bronkhorst| first2 = Johannes| last3 = Spuler| first3 = Bertold| last4 = Altenmüller| first4 = Hartwig| title = Handbuch Der Orientalistik: India. Education in ancient India| year = 2002| isbn = 978-90-04-12556-8| page = 141 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars date Takshashila's existence back to the sixth century BC.&lt;ref name="Britannica Education"&gt;"History of Education", ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The school consisted of several monasteries without large dormitories or lecture halls where the religious instruction was most likely still provided on an individualistic basis.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Takshashila is described in some detail in later [[Jataka tales|Jātaka]] tales, written in [[Sri Lanka]] around the fifth century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall 1975:81&lt;/ref&gt;

It became a noted centre of learning at least several centuries BC, and continued to attract students until the destruction of the city in the fifth century AD. Takshashila is perhaps best known because of its association with [[Chanakya]]. The famous [[treatise]] [[Arthashastra]] ([[Sanskrit]] for The knowledge of [[Economics]]) by Chanakya, is said to have been composed in Takshashila itself. Chanakya (or Kautilya),&lt;ref&gt;[http://britannica.com/eb/article-9044882 Kautilya] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110120535/http://britannica.com/eb/article-9044882 |date=10 January 2008 }}.

Generally, a student entered Takshashila at the age of sixteen. The [[Vedas]] and the Eighteen Arts, which included skills such as [[archery]], [[hunting]], and [[elephant]] lore, were taught, in addition to its [[law school]], [[medical school]], and school of [[military science]].&lt;ref name=Mookerji/&gt;

=== Vikramashila ===
[[Vikramashila]] was one of the two most important centres of learning in India during the [[Pala Empire]], along with [[Nalanda]]. Vikramashila was established by King [[Dharmapala (emperor)|Dharmapala]] (783 to 820) in response to a supposed decline in the quality of scholarship at Nalanda. [[Atisha]], the renowned [[Pandita (Buddhism)|pandita]], is sometimes listed as a notable [[abbot]]. It was destroyed by the forces of [[Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khilji]] around 1200.&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson, Alexis. "The Śaiva Age: The Rise and Dominance of Śaivism during the Early Medieval Period." In: Genesis and Development of Tantrism, edited by Shingo Einoo. Tokyo: Institute of Oriental Culture, University of Tokyo, 2009. Institute of Oriental Culture Special Series, 23, pp. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vikramashila is known to us mainly through Tibetan sources, especially the writings of [[Tāranātha]], the Tibetan monk historian of the 16th–17th centuries.&lt;ref name="whc.unesco"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5407/ |title=Excavated Remains at Nalanda |website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |accessdate=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vikramashila was one of the largest Buddhist universities, with more than one hundred teachers and about one thousand students.  It produced eminent scholars who were often invited by foreign countries to spread Buddhist learning, culture and religion. The most distinguished and eminent among all was [[Atisha]] Dipankara, a founder of the [[Sarma (Tibetan Buddhism)|Sarma]] traditions of Tibetan Buddhism. Subjects like philosophy, grammar, metaphysics, [[Indian logic]] etc. were taught here, but the most important branch of learning was [[tantrism]].

===Other===
Further centers include [[Telhara, Nalanda district|Telhara]] in Bihar&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://yac.bih.nic.in/Documents/Telhara-(Nalanda)-Excavation-Report.pdf | title=TELHARA (NALANDA) EXCAVATION A Brief Report | publisher=yac.bih.nic.in | accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (probably older than Nalanda&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.firstpost.com/fwire/telhara-universitys-ruins-older-than-nalanda-vikramshila-1849141.html | title=Telhara University's ruins older than Nalanda, Vikramshila | publisher=firstpost | date=14 December 2014 | accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Odantapuri]], in [[Bihar]] (circa 550 - 1040), [[Somapura]], in [[Bangladesh]] (from the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta period]] to the [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent|Turkic Muslim conquest]]), [[Sharada Peeth]], [[Pakistan]], [[Jagaddala Mahavihara]], in [[Bengal]] (from the [[Pala Empire|Pala period]] to the [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent|Turkic Muslim conquest]]), [[Nagarjunakonda]], in [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Vikramashila]], in [[Bihar]] (''circa'' 800-1040), [[Valabhi]], in [[Gujarat]] (from the Maitrak period to the [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent|Arab raids]]), [[Varanasi]] in [[Uttar Pradesh]] (eighth century to modern times), [[Kanchipuram]], in [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Manyakheta]], in [[Karnataka]], [[Mahavihara]], [[Abhayagiri Vihāra]], and [[Jetavanaramaya]], in [[Sri Lanka]].&lt;!-- In [[Sri Lanka]], [[Sunethradevi Pirivena]], a centre of Buddhist learning in Sri Lanka, was founded circa 1415.--&gt;

== East Asia ==
In [[China]], the ancient imperial academy known as [[Taixue]] was established by the [[Han Dynasty]]. It was intermittently inherited by succeeding Chinese dynasties up until the Qing dynasty, in some of which the name was changed to [[Guozixue]] or [[Guozijian]]. [[Peking University]] (Imperial University of Peking) established in 1898 is regarded as the replacement of Taixue. By 725 AD, [[Shuyuan]] or Academies of Classical Learning were private learning institutions established during the medieval Chinese [[Tang dynasty]].  In [[Japan]], [[Daigaku-no kami|Daigakuryo]] was founded in 671 and [[Ashikaga Gakko]] was founded in the 9th century and restored in 1432. In [[Korea]], [[Gukhak|Taehak]] was founded in 372 and [[Gukhak]] was established in 682. [[Seowon]]s were private institutions established during the [[Joseon dynasty]] which combined functions of a [[Confucian shrine]] and a preparatory school. The [[Seonggyungwan]] was founded by in 1398 to offer prayers and memorials to [[Confucius]] and his disciples, and to promote the study of the [[Confucianism|Confucian canon]]. It was the successor to [[Gukjagam]] from the [[Goryeo Dynasty]] (992). It was reopened as a private Western-style university in 1946.

== Ancient Persia ==
The [[Academy of Gondishapur]] was established in the 3rd century AD under the rule of [[Sassanid]] kings and continued its scholarly activities up to four centuries after Islam came to Iran. It was an important medical centre of the 6th and 7th centuries and a prominent example of higher education model in pre-Islam Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Salari|first=H|title=University in Iran|url=http://www.jazirehdanesh.com/find.php?item=19.496.564.fa|work=paper|publisher=jazirehdanesh|accessdate=13 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Platonic Academy]] in Athens was closed in 529, some of its pagan scholars went to Gundishahpur, although they returned within a year to Byzantium.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11075">'''Assessment in computer-supported collaborative learning''' (CSCL) environments is a subject of interest to educators and researchers. The [[Educational assessment|assessment]] tools utilized in [[computer-supported collaborative learning]] settings are used to measure groups' knowledge of the [[collaborative]] processes, the quality of groups' products and individuals' collaborative learning skills.

==Perspective==
Traditional assessment is equated with individualized exams and evaluations. However, in online collaborative learning, assessment requires a broader perspective as it encompasses the collaborative interactions using [[asynchronous learning|asynchronous]] and [[Synchronization|synchronous]] communications between group members. Assessment has been found to have a significant effect on CSCL by motivating learners through accountability and constructive feedback. It supports students in growing familiar with the course content through discourse and effectively encourages the participation of students.&lt;ref&gt;Macdonald, (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
Assessment is the systematic basis for making inferences about the learning and development of students. Specifically, assessment is the process of defining, selecting, analyzing, interpreting, and using information to increase students' learning and development.&lt;ref name="Swan, Shen, &amp; Hiltz 2006"&gt;Swan, Shen, &amp; Hiltz (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Assessment is an ongoing process aimed at understanding and improving student learning. It involves making expectations explicit and public; setting appropriate criteria and high standards for learning quality; systematically gathering, analyzing, and interpreting evidence to determine how well performance matches those expectations and standards; and using the resulting information to document, explain, and improve performance.&lt;ref name="Swan, Shen, &amp; Hiltz 2006" /&gt;
Types of assessment in CSCL include whole-group assessment, self-assessment, peer assessment, assessment tools in CSCL, &lt;!--what does this mean distinct from the others?--&gt; performance [[rubric]], product rubric, and [[blog]]s&lt;!--really? how isn't that just a product, not an assessment type?--&gt;

==Instructor's role in CSCL assessment==
A paradigm shift occurs in the assessment of the products and processes in CSCL. In the traditional educational setting, final assessment is performed exclusively by the instructor.&lt;ref&gt;McConnell (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;(p.&amp;nbsp;232) In CSCL, the instructor designs, facilitates, direct instruction and provide [[Technology|technical]] guidance.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, et al.2001&lt;/ref&gt; The participants take an active role in setting the standard criteria for assessing individual and group learning.

==Technology use in CSCL assessment==
Various technologies may provide information that may be used for assessment purposes. For example, email, computer conferencing systems, bulletin boards, and [[hypermedia]] can be used as media for communication between group members in CSCL classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;Hoare, V (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;(p.&amp;nbsp;13). This technology can be used to keep a record of the students' interactions. This interaction record enables the instructor and students in assessing a learner's participation and collaboration with the group.&lt;ref&gt;Suther, D. (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;(p.&amp;nbsp;664).

==Process assessment vs. product assessment==
In CSCL settings, the relative value of the collaborative process and the product must be appropriately balanced. The [[pedagogical]] principle in CSCL environments is the assumption that knowledge is constructed through social negotiation and discussion with others. This social interaction encourages [[critical thinking]] and [[understanding]].&lt;ref&gt;Pozzi, Manca, Persico and Sarti (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;(p.&amp;nbsp;309) When learning occurs through social interaction, knowledge building can also be observed through text analysis or [[discourse analysis]]. One way to assess knowledge construction in online collaborative settings is by collecting and analyzing the discursive events recorded and kept as history in computer conferencing systems in the form of  [[virtual artifact]]. [[:wikt:transcript|Transcript]]s can be used to determine the quantity and quality of interactions in negotiating meaning of the course material.&lt;ref name="Macdonald 2003"&gt;Macdonald (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;(p.&amp;nbsp;379) The instructor evaluates the messages exchanged by the students for meaningfulness and pertinence in regards to the target content.

==Assessment of the process==
Instructors can use discourse analysis to assess the students' learning of the collaborative process itself. The instructor can make use of the dialogue to look for cues of collaboration: support and respect in their criticisms, consideration of other teammates' opinions, negotiation of meaning, demonstration of mutual understanding, achievement of consensus, problem-solving, and time and task management issues. Another consideration in assessing students' collaborative skills, is the students' competence in online collaboration. As proficiency develops in progressive stages, the instructor can design the assessment to account for the students' developing competence in progressive steps throughout the online collaborative process.&lt;ref name="Macdonald 2003" /&gt;(p.&amp;nbsp;378)

==Assessment of the product==
Collaborative products can be used to assess learners' knowledge acquisition. The products can be: a concept map, a report, a research paper, an essay, a [[wiki]], a [[website]], etc. Two assessable elements of collaborative product are the overall quality of the collaborative product and the contributions of each individual.&lt;ref name="Pozzi et al. 2007"&gt;Pozzi et al. (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;(p.&amp;nbsp;386)  Each member of the group must participate in the collaborative activities. The products created by groups of students in CSCL contexts cannot be used as the sole evidence of knowledge acquisition. Although a quality product may be important, it is the process that generates the actual learning."&lt;ref name="Pozzi et al. 2007" /&gt;(p.&amp;nbsp;170)

==Self and peer assessment==
[[Self assessment]] in CSCL, students taking responsibility of learning by evaluating and judging aspects of their own learning activity.&lt;ref name="Falchikov, 1986"&gt;Falchikov, (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; In peer assessment, individuals take into account the quantity and quality of their own product or performance.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; In CSCL, these two types of assessments are dynamically interrelated. The aim of self and peer assessments in CSCL is to improve students' learning, and develop individual learning skills as well as grading individual learning outcomes.&lt;ref name="Falchikov, 1986" /&gt;
Self and peer assessment:
# drives students' learning;
# aids students in recognizing individual potential and sharing collaborative work effectively and efficiently;
# enables instructors to perceive the effect of individual learning through discourse;
# informs the instructor of the students' opinion change and skill improvement that occurs through adversity in the online collaborative process;
# develops students as retrospective thinkers.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--This is how you auto number lists, but prose is considered better form than lists in Wikipdia articles--&gt;

==Group work assessment==
Group work assessment in CSCL measures the quantity and quality of students' learning as a team. Group work or [[teamwork]] is a collaborative learning situation in which students share the task of developing a product presented at the end of the course.&lt;ref name="De Hoyos2004"&gt;De Hoyos(2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Group work is not measured and interpreted independently but evaluated with other assessment tools, and plays a role in assisting learners' to reflect on their learning process.&lt;ref name="De Hoyos2004" /&gt;
Group work assessment:
# diagnoses the collaborative learning process and shows the instructor what works and what does not;
# identifies and corrects destructive conflict in collaborative learning;
# facilitates learners' reflection making the collaborative task effective and efficient;
# allows the instructor to monitor the collaborative learning processes and gather the information about individual performance and contributions to product quality.

==E-portfolio assessment==
[[E-portfolio]] can be used in assessment of CSCL activities by showing students' growth or proficiency in learning. Organizing information about individual students, the instructor keeps track of the student's learning process. These portfolios are managed online and are referred to as electronic portfolio, digital portfolio, or web-portfolio.
In using E-portfolios in CSCL assessment an instructor determines:
# purpose;
# type;
# choice of items to include;
# guidelines or criteria;
# impact on the teacher and students;
# self-reflection component.&lt;ref&gt;Butler &amp; McMunn, (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11297">The '''assessment of basic language and learning skills''' (ABLLS, often pronounced "ables") is an educational tool used frequently with [[applied behavior analysis]] (ABA) to measure the basic linguistic and functional skills of an individual with developmental delays or disabilities.

==Development==
The revised assessment of basic language and learning skills (ABLLS-R) is an assessment tool, curriculum guide, and skills-tracking system used to help guide the instruction of language and critical learner skills for children with autism or other developmental disabilities.  It provides a comprehensive review of 544 skills from 25 skill areas including language, social interaction, self-help, academic and motor skills that most typically developing children acquire prior to entering kindergarten.  Expressive language skills are assessed based upon the behavioral analysis of language as presented by Dr. B.F. Skinner in his book, Verbal Behavior (1957).  The task items within each skill area are arranged from simpler to more complex tasks.  This practical tool facilitates the identification of skills needed by the child to effectively communicate and learn from everyday experiences.  The information obtained from this assessment allows parents and professionals to pinpoint obstacles that have been preventing a child from acquiring new skills and to develop a comprehensive language-based curriculum.
  
The ABLLS-R comprises two documents.  The ABLLS-R Protocol is used to score the child’s performance on the task items and provides 15 appendices that allow for the tracking of a variety of specific skills that are included in the assessment.  The ABLLS-R Guide provides information about the features of the ABLLS-R, how to correctly score items, and how to develop Individualized Education Program (IEP) goals and objectives that clearly define and target the learning needs of a student.  

The original version was first released in 1998 by [http://www.behavioranalysts.com Behavior Analysts, Inc.] and was developed by James W. Partington, Ph.D., BCBA-D and Mark L. Sundberg, Ph.D, BCBA-D.  It was revised in 2006 by  Partington.  The revised version incorporates many new task items and provides a more specific sequence in the developmental order of items within the various skill areas.  Significant changes were made in the revised version of the vocal imitation section with input from Denise Senick-Pirri, SLP-CCC.  Additional improvements were made to incorporate items associated with social interaction skills, motor imitation and other joint attention skills, and to ensure the fluent use of established skills.

==WebABLLS and normative data==

The [http://www.webablls.com WebABLLS] is an electronic version of the assessment.  It allows parents, teachers, speech pathologists, behavior analysts, and others who design, coordinate, or supervise language or skill-acquisition programs to expedite the development of IEPs, progress reports, and to easily share information about a child.  The WebABLLS provides videos of many skills that are measured by the ABLLS-R and can be used to demonstrate those specific skills.

Over the past four years, parents, relatives and friends of typically developing children have been participating in an ongoing research project by entering data into the WebABLLS.  The data are collected by parents or professionals who both know the children and have received training in the administration of the ABLLS-R.  The data are updated at three-month intervals (i.e., 6 months, 9 months, 12 months) in order to track the specific changes in skills over the course of the children’s development.  These preliminary data have been collected in a systematic manner to provide information about when each skill measured by the ABLLS-R is usually acquired by typically developing children.  

The preliminary data from this research project are from 81 children (42 females &amp; 39 males) ranging in age from 6 months to 60 months.  Children are from a variety of geographical locations (both nationally and internationally) and of differing ethnic, socio-economic and educational backgrounds.  The average percent of the total possible scores along with the range from the highest to the lowest scores for the sample at each 3-month age intervals are presented.  The data clearly indicate that typically developing children demonstrate most of the basic language and learning skills measured by the ABLLS-R by the time they are 4 to 5 years of age.

==Usage==
While the ABLLS-R is most commonly used on children with developmental disabilities and delays (including [[autism]]), it can be used for anyone who may be lacking in basic communication or life skills.

It assesses the strengths and weaknesses of an individual in each of the 25 skill sets. Each skill set is broken down into multiple skills, ordered by typical development or complexity. So, a skill of F1 (Requests by indicating) is a simpler skill than F12 (Requesting Help). ''Usually'', lower level skills are needed before proceeding to teach higher skills. However, many individuals display [[splinter skill]]s that are above their practical level.

The ABLLS-R is conducted via observation of the child's behavior in each skill area. The instructor will provide a stimulus to the child (verbal, hand-over-hand, non-verbal, etc.), and, depending on what the child does (the behavior), determines their skill-level. Some skills are difficult or time-consuming to test; instructors frequently accept anecdotal evidence from parents and other instructors as to a child's ability at a given skill-level.

==Sections==
The ABLLS-R is split into 25 functional areas, each corresponding to a letter in the alphabet. The sections between the ABLLS and ABLLS-R are similar; it is mostly the skills that vary in number and scope.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
The following is a very brief list of advantages and disadvantages to using the ABLLS-R assessment.&lt;ref&gt;Valentino, Amber, M.A. &amp; Flake, Lisa, BCABA (2007). ABA/VB 6 Session Training Series.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advantages===
* Can be conducted by most people with a minimal understanding of [[applied behavior analysis]].
* Addresses basic language, academic, self-help, classroom, and gross and fine motor skill sets.
* Provides quick review for parents and educators to identify skill level of student
* Easy for parents and teachers to communicate about the student’s educational programming
* Provides data to indicate the skill level of normal development

===Disadvantages===
* Skill lists are not exhaustive (544 skills).
* Skills are mostly in order of childhood development, but every child learns differently.
* Not a fully standardized assessment

The '''Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Faisalabad (BISE Faisalabad)''' is an examining board for intermediate (higher secondary) and secondary (high school) education in [[Faisalabad Division]].

== Introduction ==
BISE Faisalabad was established in 1988. The current jurisdiction of the board was first under the supervision of [[Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Sargodha]].
Its main building is now on the main jhang road near the [[Faisalabad International Airport]].

== Jurisdiction ==
The jurisdiction of Faisalabad Board includes [[Faisalabad Division]] which includes the following districts:

* [[Faisalabad]]
* [[Chiniot]]
* [[Toba Tek Singh]]
* [[Jhang]]
* [[Jaranwala]]

== BISE Faisalabad exams and results ==
Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education conducts Matric (9th and 10th) class exams and Intermediate (part I and part II) exams every year. A great number of students participate in these exams every year. The exams mostly started in the month of March and ends April while the results of BISE Faisalabad announced in the month of July and August. The matric result usually announced in July while the inter result announced in the end of August or the start of September. Results of all the classes are also published on the BISE website. On the days when the results of 10th and 12th class are announced, there is a ceremony at the Board office where medals and other awards are given to the position holder students.

A '''cheat sheet''' (also ''cheatsheet'') or '''crib sheet''' is a concise set of notes used for quick reference.

Cheat sheets are so named because they may be used by students without the instructor's knowledge to [[Cheating|cheat]] on a [[Test (assessment)|test]]. However, at higher levels of education where [[rote learning|rote memorization]] is not as important as in basic education, students may be permitted to consult their own notes during the exam (which is not considered cheating).  The act of preparing a crib sheet can be an educational exercise, and students are sometimes only allowed to use crib sheets they have written themselves. 

A cheat sheet is a physical piece of paper, often filled with equations and/or facts in compressed writing. Students often print cheat sheets in extremely small font, fitting an entire page of notes in the palm of their hands during the exam.

Crib sheets are also fully worked solutions for exams or work sheets normally handed out to university staff in order to ease marking.

==As reference cards==
{{Main|Reference card}}
In more general usage, a crib sheet is any short (one or two page) reference to terms, commands, or symbols where the user is expected to understand the use of such terms but not necessarily to have memorized all of them.  Many computer applications, for example, have crib sheets included in their documentation, which list keystrokes or menu commands needed to achieve specific tasks to save the user the effort of digging through an entire manual to find the keystroke needed to, for example, move between two windows.  An example of such a crib sheet is one for the [[GIMP]] photo editing software.&lt;ref name="Keys and Mouse Reference"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://docs.gimp.org/en/key-reference.html |title=GIMP Keys and Mouse Reference |accessdate=2008-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples include "Read Me First" and "Quick Reference Card" documents included with consumer electronics.

Some academic and technical publishers also publish crib sheets for software packages and technical topics.  In some cases these are also intended as display items in that they are colorful and visually appealing. Web-based crib sheets, such as references to terms, commands, or symbols, have become extremely common.

'''Connected learning''' is a type of learning that integrates personal interest, peer relationships, and achievement in academic, civic, or career-relevant areas.&lt;ref name="Itoetal"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://dmlhub.net/sites/default/files/Connected_Learning_report.pdf|title=Connected learning: An agenda for research and design|last=Ito|first=M.|last2=Gutiérrez|first2=K.| last3=Livingstone

|first9=S.G.| date=2013|publisher=Digital Media and Learning Research Hub|location= Irvine, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, connected learning is an approach to educational reform keyed to the abundance of information and social connection brought about by networked and digital media. Advocates of connected learning posit that this approach leverages new media to broaden access to opportunity and meaningful learning experiences.&lt;ref name="Itoetal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CronwellCronwell"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tcfir.org/whitepapers/Connected%20Learning%20Framework.pdf|title =Connected learning: A framework of observation, research and development to guide the reform of education|last=Cornwell|first=W. R. |last2=Cornwell|first2=J. R.|date=2006|publisher=The Center for Internet Research|location=Breckenridge, CO}}&lt;/ref&gt; The connected learning model suggests that youth learn best when: they are interested in what they are learning; they have peers and mentors who share these interests; and their learning is directed toward opportunity and recognition.&lt;ref name="Itoetal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CronwellCronwell" /&gt; According to the proponents of connected learning, social support for interest-driven learning and connections to multiple sites of learning activity drive individual learning outcomes. These individual outcomes also lead to collective outcomes by building knowledge, capacity and expertise in diverse communities.&lt;ref name="Itoetal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CronwellCronwell" /&gt;  Environments that support connected learning are generally characterized as having a sense of shared purpose, a focus on production, and openly networked infrastructures.

== History ==
Connected learning has been a term used in research since the early 1990s.&lt;ref name=Schwartz&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ajot.aotapress.net/content/45/11/1033|title=Clinical reasoning and new ideas on intelligence: Implications for teaching and learning|last=Schwartz|first=K.

A.|last2=Moch|first2=S. D.|work=The Journal of Higher Education|date=1995|volume=66|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original usages piggybacked on the concept of [[Women's development theory#Procedural Knowledge: Separate and connected knowing|connected knowing]],&lt;ref name=Belenkyetal&gt;{{cite book|title=Women's Ways of Knowing|last=Belenky|first=M. F.|last2=Clinchy|first2=B. M.|last3=Goldberger|first3=N. R.|last4=Tarule|first4=J. M.|date=1986|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; which emphasized the importance of context in the development of knowledge for women. Many articles from this time used the term connected learning in reference to hands-on education like fieldwork&lt;ref name="LundebergMoch" /&gt; or internships which is tied to the concept of learning in context. The early research that used the term connected learning also shared the common theme of sociality being important to learning outcomes.&lt;ref name=Tinto&gt;{{cite news|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/review_of_higher_education/v021/21.2tinto.html|title=Colleges as communities: Taking research on student persistence seriously|last=Tinto|first=V.|work=The Review of Higher Education|date=1998|volume=21|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2000, the term connected learning began to be used in research publications to refer variously to project-based, networked, social, and information-age learning.&lt;ref name="Vaz"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ605181|title=Connected learning: Interdisciplinary projects in international settings|last=Vaz|first=R. F.|work=Liberal Education|date=2000|volume=86|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DownesZammit"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-0-387-35403-3_10|title=New literacies for connected learning in global classrooms|last=Downes|first=T.|last2=Zammit|first2=K.|work=Information and Communication Technologies|date=2001|volume=86|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kearns&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.voced.edu.au/content/ngv9887|title=Towards the connected learning society: An international overview of trends in policy for information and communication technology in education|last=Kearns|first=P.| date=2002| publisher=Global Learning Services|location=Kambah, Australian Capital Territory}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cazden"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newcastle.edu.au/Resources/Schools/Education/Pedagogy/2006/PiP-2006-keynote.pdf|title=Connected learning: "Weaving" in classroom lessons|last=Cazden|first=C.

Cronwell and Cronwell created the first "framework and an organizing set of principles to guide educational research and development," (p.&amp;nbsp;17).&lt;ref name="CronwellCronwell" /&gt; This research was supported by the Center for Internet Research. This connected learning framework is based on the following set of principles:
* The education process must become learner-centered.
* Assessment – diagnostic, formative, and summative – must be improved and deeply integrated into the learning and teaching process.
* National and state academic standards must be met or exceeded.
* Ethnic academic achievement "gaps" must be addressed and eliminated.
* Learning must become more active.
* The formation of lifelong learning behaviors must be facilitated.
* Education reform must be guided by empiricism.
* Well-designed, technology-enabled education reform will be self-improving, self-reforming and self-documenting.
* Teaching and learning content must be of the highest possible quality, current and relevant.
* Proven pedagogical methodologies and the best research from all field with a bearing on learning and teaching must be integrated into education.
* The needs of all stakeholders (students, teachers, parents, administration, government, business, etc.) must be served.
* Reform must also address the need to improve the formation and achievement of vocational goals by students.
* Where minimum standards exist, the goal must be near-universal mastery rather than a standard distribution of achievement. (pp.&amp;nbsp;19)&lt;ref name="CronwellCronwell" /&gt;
This idea of connected learning is supposed to be an alternative to traditional in-school instruction. They label this connected learning framework as a work in progress that needs more research to support it. However, no further research has been completed on this framework.

== Examples ==
Examples of learning environments that integrate peer, interest, and academic pursuits including athletics programs that are tied to in-school recognition, certain arts and civic learning programs, and interest-driven academic programs such as math, chess, or robotics competitions. These connected learning environments embody values of equity, social belonging, and participation. Connected learning environments include a sense of shared purpose, a focus on production, and openly networked infrastructures.&lt;ref name="Itoetal" /&gt; Learning environments that embody principles of connected learning include:

== Reception ==
Connected learning since its recent ramp up has been well received from the global education community.&lt;ref name="YALSA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yalsa.ala.org/blog/2013/09/18/amplified-connected-learning-advocacy-the-2014-yalsa-presidents-program/|title= YALSA 2014 President’s Program on Connected Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Infographic"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/search?q=connectedlearning.tv%2Finfographic&amp;src=typd&amp;f=realtime|title= Connectedlearning.tv/infographic twitter results}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Whatisconnectedlearning"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/search?q=connectedlearning.tv%2Fwhat-is-connected-learning&amp;src=typd&amp;f=realtime |title= Connectedlearning.tv/what-is-connected-learning twitter results}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gerstein"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usergeneratededucation.wordpress.com/2012/03/02/connect-learning-a-new-research-driven-initiative/ |title= Connected learning: A new research-driven initiative|last=Gerstein|first=J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heick"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teachthought.com/culture/connected-learning-the-power-of-social-learning-models/|title= Connected learning: The power of social learning models | last=Heick|first=T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EducatorsTechnology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.educatorstechnology.com/2012/08/teachers-guide-to-21st-century-learning.html |title= Teachers guide to 21st century learning: Connected learning}}&lt;/ref&gt; Educators and policymakers have raised concerns regarding the new model of learning laid out by research and practitioner groups, which included:
* Connected learning is "yet another buzz word for the corporatization of education."&lt;ref name="CollegeLevel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.bedfordstmartins.com/bits/uncategorized/can-connected-learning-work-at-the-college-level/ |title=Can connected learning work at the college level?}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Connected learning is devoid of critical thinking as it relies on "a formula for students getting what they already want to find . . . . . [rather than] broadening horizons to discover what is not already known."&lt;ref name="Threattoconnectedlearning"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitalis.nwp.org/site-blog/threat-connected-learning/3698|title=The Threat to Connected Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The model gives no mention of key K-12 educators who have been pushing for similar types of networked/connected learning for the past decade.&lt;ref name="Whathavetheydone"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/2012/03/03/connected-learning-what-have-they-done-with-alec-will-vicki/
|title=Connected Learning: What have they done with Alec, Will, Vicki?
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Increased workload for those who support learners is also a concern&lt;ref name="7Things"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.educause.edu/library/resources/7-things-you-should-know-about-connected-learning|title= 7 Things you should know about connected learning }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[https://clrn.dmlhub.net/ Connected Learning Research Network] chair [[Mizuko Ito|Mimi Ito]] responded to the criticism pointing out that, "the connected learning principles were developed with a very diverse range of practitioners in K-12 and other learning institutions like museums and libraries, as well as people working in popular culture/media, technology, and university researchers. So while the research network hopes to provide a research component to feed the broader connected learning effort, we are by no means the driving force behind it.”&lt;ref name="EducatorsTechnology" /&gt;

'''[[Constructivism (philosophy of education)|Constructivism]]''' has been considered as a dominant paradigm, or research programme,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Imre |last=Lakatos |chapter=Falsification and the methodology of scientific research programmes |editor1-first=Imre |editor1-last=Lakatos |editor2-first=Alan |editor2-last=Musgrave |title=Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge |volume=4 |series=Proceedings of the International Colloquium in the Philosophy of Science, London, 1965 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vutfm5n6LKYC&amp;pg=PA91 |date=2 September 1970 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-09623-2 |pages=91–196}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the field of '''[[science education]]'''. The term constructivism is widely used in many fields, and not always with quite the same intention. This entry offers an account of how constructivism is most commonly understood in science education.

==Description==
Science Education is now an established field within Education, and worldwide has its own journals, conferences, university departments and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Peter J. |last=Fensham |title=The Evolution of Science Education as a Field of Research: Defining an Identity |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZE9WVALhQTAC |year=2004 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-4020-1468-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although a diverse field, a major influence on its development was research considered to be undertaken from a constructivist perspective on learning, and supporting approaches to teaching that themselves became labelled constructivist. Thus, this constructivism was largely of a psychological flavour, often drawing on the work of [[Jean Piaget]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jean |last=Piaget |title=The Child's Conception Of the World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RWZIOL0NDLwC |year=2007 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |isbn=978-0-7425-5951-6 |edition=2nd |origyear=1929}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jean |last=Piaget |title=The Principles of Genetic Epistemology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rr-avb4T8ksC |year=1997 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-16890-8 |origyear=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Ausubel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ausubel, D.P. |title=Educational Psychology: A cognitive view |publisher=Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston |location=New York |year=1968 |isbn=978-0030696404 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert M. Gagné]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gagné, R.M. |title=The Conditions of Learning |publisher=Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston |year=1970 |isbn=978-0039100698 |edition=2nd }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jerome Bruner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jerome S. |last=Bruner |title=The Process of Education |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Iaq5R8vPujAC |year=1977 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-71001-6 |edition=2nd |origyear=1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; One influential group of science education researchers were also heavily influenced by [[George Kelly (psychologist)]]'s [[Personal Construct Theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=George |last=Kelly |title=A Theory of Personality: The Psychology of Personality Constructs |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sp5iH1deNNEC |year=1963 |publisher=W.W. Norton |isbn=978-0-393-00152-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work of [[Lev Vygotsky]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=L. Lev Semenovich |last=Vygotskiĭ |title=Thought and Language |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bkz7stcdbKgC |year=1986 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-72010-6 |origyear=1934}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=L. Lev Semenovich |last=Vygotskiĭ |title=Mind in Society: The Development of Higher Psychological Processes |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RxjjUefze_oC |year=1978 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-57629-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; (since being championed in the West by [[Jerome Bruner]]) has also been increasingly influential.

These workers from psychology informed the first generation of science education researchers. Active research groups developed in centres like the [[University of Waikato]] (Aotearoa/New Zealand), [[University of Leeds]] (UK) and [[University of Surrey]] (UK), with a strong interest in students' ideas in science (formed before, or during instruction) as these were recognised as being highly influential on future learning, and so whether canonical scientific would be learnt. This work, sometimes labelled the 'alternative conceptions movement' was motivated by a series of influential publications on children's ideas in science and their implications for learning (and so for how teaching should be planned to take them into account). Whilst a range of influential papers could be cited it has been suggested that a number of seminar contributions &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Driver, R. |author2=Easley, J. |title=Pupils and paradigms: a review of literature related to concept development in adolescent science students |journal=Studies in Science Education |volume=5 |pages=61–84 |year=1978 |doi=10.1080/03057267808559857 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Driver, R. |author2=Erickson, G. |title=Theories-in-action: some theoretical and empirical issues in the study of students' conceptual frameworks in science |journal=Studies in Science Education |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=37–60 |year=1983 |doi=10.1080/03057268308559904 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gilbert, J.K. |author2=Watts, D.M. |title=Concepts, misconceptions and alternative conceptions: changing perspectives in science education |journal=Studies in Science Education |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=61–98 |year=1983 |doi=10.1080/03057268308559905 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gilbert, J.K. |author2=Osborne, R.J. |author3=Fensham, P.J. |title=Children's science and its consequences for teaching |journal=Science Education |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=623–633 |year=1982 |doi=10.1002/sce.3730660412 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Osborne, R.J. |author2=Wittrock, M.C. |title=Learning Science: a generative process |journal=Science Education |volume=67 |issue=4 |pages=489–508 |year=1983 |doi=10.1002/sce.3730670406 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in effect set out the commitments, or 'hard core' of a constructivist research programme into the learning and teaching of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Taber, K.S. |title=Beyond Constructivism: the Progressive Research Programme into Learning Science |journal=Studies in Science Education |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=125–184 |year=2006 |doi=10.1080/03057260608560222 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Taber09&gt;{{cite book |first=Keith S. |last=Taber |title=Progressing Science Education: Constructing the Scientific Research Programme Into the Contingent Nature of Learning Science |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=96tslSL3UfwC |year=2009 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-90-481-2431-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The perspective was also the focus of a number of books aimed at the science education community - researchers and teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Driver, R. |title=The Pupil as Scientist? |publisher=Open University Press |location=Milton Keynes |year=1983 |isbn=978-0335101788 |oclc=10585522 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Driver, R. |author2=Guesne, E. |author3=Tiberghien, A. |title=Children's Ideas in Science |publisher=Open University Press |location=Milton Keynes |year=1985 |isbn=978-0335150403 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Paul J. |last1=Black |first2=Arthur M. |last2=Lucas |title=Children's Informal Ideas in Science |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IlxS0fBb5woC |year=1993 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-00539-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These papers presented learning as process of personal sense making, and an iterative matter such that what is learnt was channelled by existing knowledge and understanding (whether canonical or alternative), and teaching as needing to take learners' existing ideas into account in teaching. The research programme soon amounted to thousands of studies on aspects of students' (of different ages and educational levels, from different countries) thinking and learning in science topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Duit, R. |title=Bibliography—STCSE (Students' and Teachers' Conceptions and Science Education) |year=2009 |publisher=Kiel:IPN—Leibniz Institute for Science Education |url=http://www.ipn.uni-kiel.de/aktuell/stcse/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been a wide range of criticisms of constructivist work in science, including strong criticism from philosophical perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Matthews, M.R. |title=Discontent With Constructivism |journal=Studies in Science Education |volume=24 |pages=165–172 |year=1994 |doi=10.1080/03057269408560045 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Scerri, E.R. |title=Philosophical confusion in chemical education research |journal=Journal of Chemical Education |volume=80 |issue=5 |pages=468–474 |year=2003 |doi=10.1021/ed080p468 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such criticisms have done little to stem the influence of the perspective, perhaps because they tend not to refer to the core tenets of constructivism as an approach based on learning theory and research from cognitive science.&lt;ref name=Taber09/&gt;

==Alternative conceptions and conceptual frameworks in science education==
Learners' ideas in science have been variously labelled as [https://camtools.cam.ac.uk/wiki/eclipse/Alternative%20conception.html alternative conceptions], alternative conceptual frameworks, preconceptions, [[scientific misconceptions]], naive theories etc. Although some scholars have attempted to distinguish between these terms, there is no consensual usage and often these terms are in effect synonymous.&lt;ref name=Taber09/&gt; It has been found that some alternative conceptions are very common, although others appear quite idiosyncratic. Some seem to be readily overcome in teaching, but others have proved to be tenacious and to offer a challenge to effective instruction. Sometimes it is considered important to distinguish fully developed conceptions (i.e., explicit ways of understanding aspects of the natural work that are readily verbalised) from more 'primitive' features of cognition acting at a tacit level, such as the so-called phenomenology primitives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=diSessa, A.A. |title=Towards an epistemology of physics |journal=Cognition and Instruction |volume=10 |issue=2–3 |pages=105–225 |year=1993 |doi=10.1080/07370008.1985.9649008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 'knowledge-in-pieces' perspective suggests the latter act as resources for new learning which have potential to support the development of either alternative or canonical knowledge according to how teachers proceed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Smith, J.P. |author2=diSessa, A.A. |author3=Roschelle, J. |title=Misconceptions reconceived: a constructivist analysis of knowledge in transition |journal=The Journal of the Learning Sciences |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=115–163 |year=1993 |doi=10.1207/s15327809jls0302_1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas alternative conceptions (or misconceptions) tend to be seen as learning impediments to be overcome. What research has shown is the prevalence among learners at all levels of alternative ways to thinking about just about all [https://camtools.cam.ac.uk/wiki/eclipse/Science%20Topics.html science topics], and a key feature of guidance to teachers is to elicit students' ideas as part of the teaching process. The success of constructivism is that this is now largely taken-for-granted in science teaching and has become part of standard teaching guidance in many contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Key Stage 3 National Strategy. (2002). Framework for teaching science: years 7, 8 and 9. London: Department for Education and Skills.&lt;/ref&gt; Previously there was a strong focus on the abstract nature of concepts to be learnt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Shayer, M. |author2=Adey, P. |title=Towards a Science of Science Teaching: Cognitive development and curriculum demand |publisher=Heinemann Educational Books |location=Oxford |year=1981 |isbn=978-0435578251 |oclc=7759952 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but little awareness that often the teacher was not seeking to replace ignorance with knowledge, but rather to modify and develop learners existing thinking which was often at odds with the target knowledge set out in the curriculum.

===Constructivist science teaching===
Constructivism is seen as an educational theory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Taber, K.S. |chapter=Constructivism as educational theory: Contingency in learning, and optimally guided instruction |chapterurl=https://camtools.cam.ac.uk/wiki/eclipse/Constructivism.html |editor=J.

&lt;/ref&gt; and a key perspective to inform pedagogy. There are many books informing teachers and others about constructivist research findings and ideas, and giving guidance on how to teach science form a constructivist perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Peter J. |last1=Fensham |first2=Richard T. |last2=White |first3= |title=The Content of Science: A Constructivist Approach to Its Teaching and Learning |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cg6dlitxLm0C |year=1994 |publisher=Falmer Press |isbn=978-0-7507-0221-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Joel J. |editor1-last=Mintzes |editor2-first=James H. |editor2-last=Wandersee |editor3-first=Joseph D. |editor3-last=Novak |title=Teaching Science for Understanding: A Human Constructivist View |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2zXcrHWhnDwC |year=2005 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-08-087924-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Kenneth G. |last=Tobin |title=The Practice of Constructivism in Science Education |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=47LuS0m9heEC |date=12 November 2012 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-136-48974-7 |origyear=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=K.S. |last=Taber |title=Chemical Misconceptions: Prevention, Diagnosis, and Cure : Classroom Resources |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U_P0V8vIBhUC |year=2002 |publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry |isbn=978-0-85404-381-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4083">'''Coursepacks''' are printed collections of readings assembled by teachers to supplement college and university courses.

The practice of assembling coursepacks for students developed as a systematization of the practice of disseminating "handouts" for readings in class.  This practice operated in parallel to the practice of libraries providing "[[course reserve|reserves]]"—material pulled off shelves and "reserved" for use at the library, to ensure access for students in a class.  Some teachers used coursepacks to supplement textbooks; others used them basically to create their own ad hoc textbooks.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

Over time, teachers began assembling their handouts at the beginning of the course, or having school administrators assemble them and charge students enough fees to recoup costs.  As copy shops such as ''Kinko's'' became a thriving business in the late 1970s and early 1980s, they developed a market for making these coursepacks, offering different sorts of bindings, and so forth.  Once the market became commercialized, licensing entities such as [[Copyright Clearance Center|CCC]] (the "Copyright Clearance Center") in the United States became involved, negotiating licensing and "clearance" fees for use of materials in coursepacks.  Materials that could not be licensed could not be included in coursepacks.  Primarily as a result of escalating license fees, coursepacks have become a significant expense for students, along with textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;See generally, Zick Rubin, [http://chronicle.com/article/Lets-Spread-the-Word-About/134544/ "Let's Spread the Word About Fair Use"], ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]'', Sept. 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Coursepacks themselves operated primarily as an efficient service for providing print copies of material.  As information has become increasingly available electronically, academic libraries have begun a transition to [[course reserve|electronic reserves]], making materials they have already acquired available for students registered in particular classes.  Publishers, once critics of coursepack providers, have been critical of [[course reserve|ereserves]], arguing that libraries' provision of ereserves will supplant the commercial coursepack services.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Cambridge University Press v. Becker]]'' (S.D. Georgia 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal status ==
In the United States, the question of classroom handouts received significant attention in the lobbying and negotiation leading up to the [[1976 Copyright Act]].  The statute as passed included a legislative codification of [[fair use]] at 17 U.S.C. 107 which specifically described handouts ("multiple copies for classroom use") as a fair use.  &lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies ... for purposes such as ... teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use) ... is not an infringement of copyright."&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  However, the transition from classroom handouts to coursepacks led to a shift in how these materials were treated under US copyright law.  In a series of "coursepack cases", US courts found that commercial services that profited from developing coursepacks were not protected by fair use.  ''See'' ''[[Princeton University Press v. Michigan Document Services]]'' (1996), ''[[Basic Books v. Kinko's Graphics]]'' (1991); 1982 litigation against [[New York University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecopyrightsite.org/scenarios/coursepacks.html "Copyright scenarios: Coursepacks"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513061030/http://www.thecopyrightsite.org/scenarios/coursepacks.html |date=2013-05-13 }}, TheCopyrightSite.org (last visited May 7, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Publishers and rights clearance agencies have sued universities in several other countries (Canada, New Zealand, India), in order to require fees for coursepacks or library ereserves.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

The '''Culturally Authentic Pictorial Lexicon''' is a dictionary database of images of various objects in a culturally authentic setting for language learning. All images are presented with a [[Creative Commons licenses|Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike]] license, allowing for broad academic use by language teachers.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web| title = About CAPL| work = Culturally Authentic Pictorial Lexicon| publisher = Washington &amp; Jefferson College| date = 18 June 2009 | url = http://capl.washjeff.edu/about.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; The database is also useful for researchers in the field of applied linguistics, visual cognition, and automated image recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Park| first = Jane | title =  CAPL, the Culturally Authentic Pictorial Lexicon| work = creativecommons.org | publisher = [[Creative Commons]]| date = 18 June 2009| url = https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/15353}}&lt;/ref&gt; The database averages 30,000 hits per month and has been incorporated into the curricula of many college and high-school level German teachers.&lt;ref name=usde /&gt;

The idea for the lexicon is partially based on Shaughnessy's experience with teaching materials that used American-based images and clip art to demonstrate German words and concepts.&lt;ref name=chronicle /&gt; By presenting objects in their culturally authentic context, the CAPL is designed to prepare students to live in the environment where the language is spoken.&lt;ref name=chronicle /&gt; The photographic entries are real photographs, not clip art, to force teachers to "teach terms for things that actually occur in everyday German life – instead of American concepts that have no direct European equivalent."&lt;ref name=chronicle&gt;{{cite news  | last = Read | first = Brock | title = Professor's Web Site Uses Photographs to Teach the German Language | work = The Chronicle of Higher Education | date = December 12, 2003 | url = http://chronicle.com/weekly/v50/i16/16a03103.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project was founded in 2003 as a pilot project with over 1,000 unique entries for the German language. The first images were collected by Shaughnessy in Germany and Austria through a grant from W&amp;J College.&lt;ref name=about /&gt;  In 2006, it received a $200,000 appropriation from the U.S. federal government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| title = SENATORS SANTORUM AND SPECTER ANNOUNCE COMMITTEE APPROVAL OF WESTERN PA EDUCATION PROJECTS | publisher =Office of Senator [[Arlen Specter]]| date =July 24, 2006| url =http://specter.senate.gov/index.cfm?FuseAction=PressReleases.Detail&amp;PressRelease_id=809&amp;Month=7&amp;Year=2006

'''Curriculum Theory''' ('''CT''') is an [[Discipline (academia)|academic discipline]] devoted to examining and shaping educational [[curriculum|curricula]]. There are many interpretations of CT, being as narrow as the dynamics of the [[Learning|learning process]] of one child in a [[classroom]] to the [[lifelong learning]] path an individual takes. CT can be approached from the [[education]]al, [[Philosophy|philosophical]], [[Psychology|psychological]] and [[Sociology|sociological]] perspectives. James MacDonald states "one central concern of theorists is identifying the fundamental unit of curriculum with which to build conceptual systems. Whether this be [[Rationality|rational decisions]], action processes, language [[pattern]]s, or any other [[potential]] unit has not been agreed upon by the [[Theory|theorists]]."&lt;ref&gt;J.B. MacDonald (1971). Curriculum Theory. The Journal of Educational Research, 64, 5, 195-200.&lt;/ref&gt; Curriculum theory is fundamentally concerned with [[Value (ethics)|values]],&lt;ref&gt;H.M. Kliebard (1989). Problems of Definition of Curriculum. Journal of Curriculum and Supervision, 5, 1, 1-5.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Historiography|historical analysis]] of curriculum, ways of viewing current educational curriculum and policy decisions, and theorizing about the curricula of the future.&lt;ref&gt;J.J. Wallin (2011). What is ?Curriculum Theorizing: for a People Yet to Come. Stud Philos Educ, 30, 285-301.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Pinar defines the contemporary field of curriculum theory as "the effort to understand curriculum as a [[Symbolics|symbolic]] representation".&lt;ref&gt;W.F. Pinar (2004). Understanding Curriculum. New York, NY: Peter Lang Publishing, Inc., p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first mention of the word "curriculum" in [[university]] records was in 1582, at the [[Leiden University|University of Leiden]], [[Holland]]: "having completed the curriculum of his studies".&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton (1989) in W.F. Pinar (2004). Understanding Curriculum. New York, NY: Peter Lang Publishing, Inc., p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; However, curriculum theory as a [[Discipline (academia)|field of study]] is thought to have been initiated with the publication of The [[Yale University|Yale]] Report on the Defense of the Classics in 1828, which promoted the study of a classical curriculum, including [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]], by rote [[memorization]].&lt;ref&gt;W.F. Pinar (2004). Understanding Curriculum. New York, NY: Peter Lang Publishing, Inc., p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Faculty psychology ==
The school of [[faculty psychology]], dominating the field from 1860-1890 in the [[United States]], believed that the [[brain]] was a [[muscle]] that could be improved by the exercise of [[memorization]] (with [[Comprehension (logic)|comprehension]] a secondary consideration).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Understanding Curriculum: An Introduction to the Study of Historical and Contemporary Curriculum Discourses|last=Pinar|first=William|last2=Reynolds|first2=William|last3=Slattery|first3=Patrick|last4=Taubman|first4=Peter|publisher=Peter Lang|year=1995|isbn=9780820426013|location=New York|pages=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; This supports the classical theory, which previously emphasized a method of teaching school subjects using memorization and recitation as primary instructional tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Curriculum Development in the Postmodern Era|last=Slattery|first=Patrick|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC|year=2006|isbn=9780415953375|location=New York|pages=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory itself claims three constituent faculties or power:

* the presence of [[Volition (psychology)|will]] or volition, which enables  human beings to act;
* the [[Emotion|emotions]], which pertains to the affections and passions that enable human beings to experience pleasure, pain, love, and hate; and,
* the [[intellect]] or understanding, which is the foundation of human [[rationality]] that enables him to make judgments and comprehend meanings.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Education and Human Development|last=Farenga|first=Stephen|last2=Ness|first2=Daniel|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=9780765612687|location=Oxon|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea is that education should expand the faculty of the mind and this is achieved through the key concepts of discipline and furniture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The faculty theory, which steered curriculum policy for [[Elementary school|elementary]], [[Secondary school|secondary]], and high schools, was institutionalized by three committees appointed by the [[National Education Association]] (NEA) in the 1890s to follow faculty [[psychology]] principles:&lt;ref&gt;W.F. Pinar (2004). Understanding Curriculum. New York, NY: Peter Lang Publishing, Inc., p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Committee of Ten]] on Secondary School Studies (1893), the [[Committee of Fifteen]] on Elementary Education (1895) and the Committee on College Entrance Requirements.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

== The Herbartians ==
Different schools of Curriculum Theory developed as a reaction to the [[classicism]] of [[faculty psychology]], including the Herbartians, who organized the Herbart Club in 1892, and later the National Herbart Society (1895-1899). Their philosophy was based on the thoughts of Johann Frederich Herbart, a German [[philosopher]], [[psychologist]] and [[Teacher|educator]], who believed that "the mere memorizing of isolated facts, which had characterized school instruction for ages, had little value of either educational or moral ends".
&lt;ref&gt;W.F. Pinar (2004). Understanding Curriculum. New York, NY: Peter Lang Publishing, Inc., p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The social efficiency movement ==
The publication of [[John Franklin Bobbitt|John Bobbitt]]'s The Curricula in 1918 took the prevalent industrial revolutionary concepts of [[Experiment|experimental science]] and [[Social welfare function|social efficiency]] and applied them to the classroom. He believed that "curriculum must directly and specifically prepare students for tasks in the [[Adult World|adult world]]".&lt;ref&gt;W.F. Pinar (2004). Understanding Curriculum. New York, NY: Peter Lang Publishing, Inc., p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; He also believed that "[[Life expectancy|human life]]...consists in the performance of specific activities. Education that prepares for life is one that prepares definitely and adequately for these specific activities." &lt;ref&gt;Smith, M. K. (1996, 2000) ‘Curriculum theory and practice' the encyclopaedia of informal education, www.infed.org/biblio/b-curric.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; From this idea, he suggested that curriculum was a series of experiences that children have in order to meet "[[Strategic planning|objectives]]," or abilities and habits that people need for particular activities.

Other famous theorists of this movement included [[Edward Thorndike|Edward L. Thorndyke]] (1874-1949), the father of experimental psychology in education, [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]] (1856-1915), with his theory of scientific management, [[David Snedden]], an educational sociologist who promoted social efficiency and vocational education, and W.W. Charters (1875-1952), a teacher educator who felt that "curriculum was {{sic|comprised|hide=y| of}} those methods by which objectives are determined".&lt;ref&gt;W.F. Pinar (2004). Understanding Curriculum. New York, NY: Peter Lang Publishing, Inc., p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; By using education as an efficiency tool, these [[Theory|theorists]] believed that society could be controlled. Students were scientifically evaluated by testing (such as [[Intelligence quotient|IQ tests]]), and educated towards their predicted role in society. This involved the introduction of [[Vocational education|vocational]] and junior high schools to address the curriculum designed around specific life activities that correlated with each student's determined [[Society|societal]] future. The socially efficient curriculum consisted of minute parts or tasks that together formed a bigger concept.

== The progressive reform movement ==
The progressive reform movement began in the late 1870s with the work of Colonel Francis Parker, but is most identified with [[John Dewey]], and also John Mayer Rice and [[Lester Frank Ward]]. Dewey's 1899 book [[The School and Society]] is often credited with starting the movement.&lt;ref&gt;W.F. Pinar (2004). Understanding Curriculum. New York, NY: Peter Lang Publishing, Inc., p. 90-101.&lt;/ref&gt; These reformers felt that curriculum should be child driven and at the child's present capacity level. To aid in understanding the relationship of curriculum and child, Dewey described curriculum as, "a map, a summary, an arranged and orderly view of previous experiences, serves as a guide to future experience; it gives direction; it facilitates control; it economizes effort, preventing useless wandering, and pointing out the paths which lead most quickly and most certainly to a desired result". He envisioned "the child and the curriculum are simply two limits which define a single process".&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, J. (1902). The Child and the Curriculum (pp. 1-31).

The Social Efficiency and Progressive Reform movements were rivals throughout the 1920s in the United States, with the 1930s belonging to the Progressives, or a curriculum combining aspects of both.&lt;ref&gt;W.F. Pinar (2004). Understanding Curriculum. New York, NY: Peter Lang Publishing, Inc., p. 116-142.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ralph W. Tyler]]'s Basic Principles of Curriculum and Instruction (1949) swung the pendulum of curriculum theory away from child centeredness toward more generalized behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;W.F. Pinar (2004). Understanding Curriculum. New York, NY: Peter Lang Publishing, Inc., p. 148-151.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tyler's theory was based on four fundamental questions which became known as the ''Tyler Rationale'':
# What educational purposes should the school seek to attain?
# What educational experiences can be provided that are likely to attain these purposes?
# How can these educational experiences be effectively [[Organization|organized]]?
# How can we determine whether these purposes are being attained?

== The multicultural education movement ==

There is a racial crisis in [[United States|America]], which is exacerbated by the widening gap between the rich and the poor.&lt;ref&gt;Banks, J. A. (1995). Multicultural education and curriculum transformation. The Journal of Negro Education, 64(4), 390–400&lt;/ref&gt; In order to address this gap within the [[multicultural education]] movement there is a [[body of knowledge]] which argues for the need to reconceptualise, re-envision, and rethink American schooling.&lt;ref&gt;McGee Banks, C. A., &amp; Banks, J. A. (1995). Equity pedagogy: An essential component of multicultural education. Theory into Practice, 34(3), 152–158&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous [[author]]s advocate the need for fundamental changes in the [[Education|educational system]] which acknowledges that there is a plurality within teaching and learning for students of diversity.&lt;ref&gt;Gay, G. (2002). Preparing for culturally responsive teaching. JOURNAL OF TEACHER EDUCATION-WASHINGTON DC-, 53(2), 106–116&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jabbar, A., &amp; Hardaker, G. (2013). The role of culturally responsive teaching for supporting ethnic diversity in British University Business Schools.

Pedagogy of the oppressed. Bloomsbury Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; of diversity and is an obstacle to integration into society and student achievement. Current multicultural education theory suggests that curriculum and institutional change is required to support the development of students from diverse [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] and [[Culture|cultural]] backgrounds. This is a controversial view &lt;ref&gt;d'Souza, D. (1991). Illiberal education: The politics of race and sex on campus. Simon and Schuster&lt;/ref&gt; but multicultural education argues &lt;ref&gt;Banks, J. A. (1995). Multicultural education and curriculum transformation. The Journal of Negro Education, 64(4), 390–400&lt;/ref&gt; that traditional curriculum does not adequately represent the history of the non dominant group.&lt;ref&gt;Sabry, N. S., &amp; Bruna, K. R. (2007). Learning from the experience of Muslim students in American schools: Towards a proactive model of school-community cooperation.

ERIC.&lt;/ref&gt; supports this concern for students who do not belong to the dominant group and seem to have challenging curriculum experiences that conflict with their personal cultural identity and their wider community reference groups.&lt;ref&gt;Jabbar, A., &amp; Hardaker, G. (2013). The role of culturally responsive teaching for supporting ethnic diversity in British University Business Schools.

== Sputnik and the National Defense Act ==
The launch of [[Sputnik 1|Sputnik]] in 1957 created a focus on science and math  in the United States curriculum. [[Hyman G. Rickover|Admiral Hyman Rickover]] accused the American public of indifference to intellectual achievement. "Our schools must return to the tradition of formal education in [[Western culture|Western civilization]]-transmission of [[cultural heritage]], and preparation for life through rigorous intellectual training of young minds to think clearly, logically, and independently".&lt;ref&gt;H. Rickover (1959) in W.F. Pinar (2004). Understanding Curriculum. New York, NY: Peter Lang Publishing, Inc., p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; The result was a return to curricula similar to the classicists of the 1890s and the modern birth of the traditionalists, with massive federal funding for curriculum development provided by the National Defense Act of 1958.

== Reconceptualized curriculum ==
Joseph J. Schwab was instrumental in provoking curriculum developers to think beyond the traditionalist approach. In his 1969 paper "The Practical: A Language for Curriculum" he declared the curriculum field "moribund".&lt;ref&gt;W.F. Pinar (2004). Understanding Curriculum. New York, NY: Peter Lang Publishing, Inc., p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; This, plus the social unrest of the 1960s and '70s stirred a new movement of "reconceptualization" of curricula. A group of theorists, including James Macdonald, [[Dwayne Huebner]], Ross Mooney, Herbert M. Kliebard, Paul Klohr, Michael Apple, W.F. Pinar, and others, created ways of thinking about curriculum and its role in the [[academy]], in [[school]]s, and in [[society]] in general.&lt;ref&gt;H. Kliebard (2004). The Struggle for the American Curriculum,1893-1958. New York, NY: RoutledgeFalmer.&lt;/ref&gt; Their approach included perspectives from the [[social]], [[Race (human categorization)|racial]], [[gender]], [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenological]], [[Politics|political]], [[Autobiography|autobiographical]] and [[Theology|theological]] points of view.

== &lt;font color="#777777"&gt;T&lt;/font&gt;oday ==
W.F. Pinar describes the present field "balkanized...divided into relatively separate fiefdoms or sectors of scholarship, each usually ignoring the other except for occasional criticism."&lt;ref&gt;W.F. Pinar (2004). Understanding Curriculum. New York, NY: Peter Lang Publishing, Inc., p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The top-down governmental control of educational curriculum in the [[English-speaking world|Anglophone]] world, including the United States, has been criticized as being "ahistorical and atheoretical, and as a result prone to difficult problems in its implementation".&lt;ref&gt;M. Priestley (2011). Whatever happened to curriculum theory? Critical realism and curriculum change. Pedagogy, Culture &amp; Society, 19, 2, 221-237.&lt;/ref&gt; But there are theorists who are looking beyond curriculum as "simply as a collection of study plans, syllabi, and teaching subjects. Instead, the curriculum becomes the outcome of a process reflecting a political and societal agreement about the what, why, and how of education for the desired society of the future."&lt;ref&gt;J.C. Tedesco, R. Opertii, and M. Amadio (2014). The curriculum debate: Why it is important today. Prospects, 44, 527-546.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Early College High School Initiative''' in the United States allows students to receive a [[high school diploma]] and an [[associate degree]], or up to two years of [[college credit]], by taking a mixture of [[high school]] and [[college]] classes. This differs from [[dual enrollment]], where students are enrolled in a traditional high school and take college classes, whereas early college students take high school classes in preparation for full college workloads. At early colleges, students also have fewer high school classes because some of their college classes replace their high school classes. Early colleges differ from closely related middle colleges. ECHS students spend their school day at college, and go to their home school occasionally for events such as football games, homecoming, and prom. 

The ECHS Initiative began in 2002 with funding from the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]], among others. The first early college in the United States, Bard College at Simon's Rock, was founded in 1966&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.k12academics.com/national-directories/gifted-school/bard-college-simons-rock|title=Bard College at Simon's Rock {{!}} K12 Academics|date=2018-02-24|website=www.k12academics.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Today, more than 230 early colleges across 28 states serve 50,000+ students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview &amp; FAQ|url=http://www.earlycolleges.org/overview.html|publisher=Early College High School Initiative|accessdate=20 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data==

* 92% of early college students graduate from high school,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Webb|first=Michael|title=Early College High School Initiative, Student Information System|date=April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; versus the national rate of 69 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Diplomas Count|url=http://www.edweek.org/ew/toc/2009/06/11/index.html|accessdate=5 May 2011|newspaper=Education Week|date=11 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 86% of graduates enroll in college the next semester after high school graduation.&lt;ref&gt;Webb &amp; Mayka (2011), p.9&lt;/ref&gt;
* 91% of early college graduates earn transferable college credit.&lt;ref name="Webb8"&gt;Webb &amp; Mayka (2011), p.8&lt;/ref&gt;
* 44% of graduates at schools open 4+ years earn at least one year of college credit.&lt;ref name="Webb8"/&gt;
* 24% of graduates at schools open 4+ years earn two years of college credit or an associate degree.&lt;ref name="Webb8"/&gt;
* 70% of early college students are students of color.&lt;ref name="Webb3"&gt;Webb &amp; Mayka (2011), p.3&lt;/ref&gt;
* 59% of early college students are classified as eligible for free or reduced lunch (used as a conservative estimate of how many students' families are low-income).&lt;ref name="Webb3"/&gt; Most early colleges are funded to target first generation college, low-income families, and/or academically gifted students.

[[Image:Edupunk.jpg|thumb|Jim Groom as "poster boy" for edupunk]]
'''Edupunk''' is a [[do it yourself]] (DIY) attitude to teaching and learning practices.&lt;ref name="young"&gt;{{harvnb|Young|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="keats"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/culture/culturereviews/magazine/16-10/st_jw | title = Jargon Watch: Green Crude, Popcorning, Edupunk | author = Keats, Jonathon | publisher = [[Wired Magazine]] | date = 2008-09-22 | accessdate = 2008-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tom Kuntz described edupunk as "an approach to teaching that avoids mainstream tools like PowerPoint and Blackboard, and instead aims to bring the rebellious attitude and DIY ethos of ’70s bands like The Clash to the classroom."&lt;ref name="kuntz"&gt;{{harvnb|Kuntz|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many instructional applications can be described as DIY education or ''edupunk''.

The term was first used on May 25, 2008, by [[Jim Groom]] in his blog,&lt;ref name="groom"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://bavatuesdays.com/the-glass-bees/ | title = The Glass Bees | author = Groom, Jim | publisher = Weblog bavatuesdays | date = 2008-05-25 | accessdate = 2008-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and covered less than a week later in the [[The Chronicle of Higher Education|Chronicle of Higher Education]].&lt;ref name="young" /&gt; [[Stephen Downes]], an [[online education]] theorist and an editor for the ''[[International Journal of Instructional Technology and Distance Learning]]'', noted that "the concept of edupunk has totally caught wind, spreading through the blogosphere like wildfire".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.downes.ca/cgi-bin/page.cgi?post=44760 | title = Introducing Edupunk | author = [[Stephen Downes]] | date = 2008-05-28 | accessdate = 2008-06-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aspects==
Edupunk has risen from an objection to the efforts of government and [[Corporatism|corporate interests]] in reframing and bundling [[emerging technologies]] into ''[[wikt:cookie-cutter|cookie-cutter]]'' products with pre-defined application—somewhat similar to traditional [[punk ideologies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/mortarboard/2008/06/punk_or_more_precisely.html | title = Nevermind the pedagogues, here's edupunk | author = Cohen, David | work = [[The Guardian]] | accessdate = 2008-06-16 | location=London | date=2008-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reaction to corporate influence on education is only one part of edupunk, though. Stephen Downes has identified three aspects to this approach:
* Reaction against [[commercialization]] of learning
* [[DIY ethic|Do-it-yourself attitude]]
* Thinking and learning for yourself&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Rowell | first = Laurie | title = "Edupunk" Rocks the (Virtual) House | newspaper = eLearn Magazine  | date = 2008-07-08 | url = http://www.elearnmag.org/subpage.cfm?section=articles&amp;article=65-1 | ref = harv | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
An example of edupunk was the [[University of British Columbia]]'s course "[[Wikipedia:WikiProject Murder Madness and Mayhem]]" experiment of creating articles on [[Wikipedia]] in spring 2008, "(having) one’s students as partners and peers."&lt;ref name="mayhem"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://bavatuesdays.com/murder-madness-mayhem/ | title = Murder, Madness, Mayhem is so EDUPUNK&lt;!--(sic)--&gt; | author = Groom, Jim | publisher = Weblog bavatuesdays | date = 2008-05-28 | accessdate = 2008-06-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A video clip illustrating an edupunk approach, produced by Tony Hirst at the Open University in the UK, on 8 June 2008, illustrated how quickly the edupunk concept has been adopted outside North America.&lt;ref name="Hirst"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNTlescIvW0 | title = Changing Expectations| author = Hirst, A.| publisher = YouTube | date = 2008-06-08 | accessdate = 2008-06-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A website set up by Australian educators illustrates how edupunk spread,&lt;ref name="ausedupunk"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://edupunk.com.au | title = edupunk | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080827204329/http://www.edupunk.com.au/ | archivedate = 2008-08-27 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a presentation by [[Norm Friesen]] of [[Thompson Rivers University]] identifies a number of possible intellectual precursors for the movement.

[[Hampshire College]], [[Evergreen State College]], [[Marlboro College]], [[New College of Florida]], and [[Warren Wilson College]] are collegiate institutions imbued with edupunk ideology.&lt;ref name="Friesenpres"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blip.tv/play/AeuPI4OyJA | title = The Edupunk Heritage: Precursors of Open Learning | author = [[Norm Friesen]] | publisher = Blip.tv | date = 2009-02-06 | accessdate = 2009-02-23 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Friesenart"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://wikieducator.org/Open_Education:_Precursors| title = Open Education: Precursors | author = [[Norm Friesen]]| publisher = WikiEducator | date = 2009-02-22 | accessdate = 2009-02-23 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fartlek''', which means "speed play" in [[Swedish Language|Swedish]], is  [[continuous training]] with [[interval training]].&lt;ref name="McArdle"&gt;{{cite book |last1=McArdle |first1=William D. |last2=Katch |first2=Frank I. |last3=Katch |first3=Victor L. |title=Exercise Physiology: Nutrition, Energy, and Human Performance |url= |accessdate=May 7, 2012 |edition=7th |year=2009 |month= |origyear=1981 |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location= |isbn=978-0-7817-9781-8 |page=483 |chapter=Training for Anaerobic and Aerobic Power |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=XOyjZX0Wxw4C&amp;lpg=PA376&amp;pg=PA483#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fartlek runs are a very simple form of a long distance run. Fartlek training “is simply defined as periods of fast running intermixed with periods of slower running."&lt;ref name="kerkman"/&gt; For some people, this could be a mix of jogging and sprinting, but for beginners it could be walking with jogging sections added in when possible. A simple example of what a runner would do during a fartlek run is  “sprint all out from one light pole to the next, jog to the corner, give a medium effort for a couple of blocks, jog between four light poles and sprint to a stop sign, and so on, for a set total time or distance."&lt;ref name="kerkman"/&gt; The variable [[exercise intensity|intensity]] and continuous nature of the exercise places stress on both the [[aerobic exercise|aerobic]] and [[anaerobic exercise|anaerobic]] systems. It differs from traditional interval training in that it is unstructured; intensity and/or speed varies, as the athlete wishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.vancouversun.com/health/Making+leap+from+lazy+jogging+real+racing/4522367/story.html |title=Making the leap from lazy jogging to real racing |first=Jill |last=Barker |newspaper=Vancouver Sun |date=29 March 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110404221258/http://www.vancouversun.com/health/Making+leap+from+lazy+jogging+real+racing/4522367/story.html |archivedate=4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McDonald"&gt;{{Cite book | last = McDonald | first = Lyle | title = The Ketogenic Diet: A Complete Guide for the Dieter and Practitioner  | publisher = | year = 1998 | location = | pages = 247 | isbn = 978-0-9671456-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fartlek training is generally associated with running, but can include almost any kind of exercise.

== History ==
=== Gösta Holmér ===
[[Sweden|Swedish]] coach [[Gösta Holmér]] developed fartlek in 1937, and, since then, many [[physiologists]] have adopted it. It was designed for the downtrodden Swedish [[cross country running]] teams that had been beaten throughout the 1920s by [[Paavo Nurmi]] and the [[Finnish people|Finns]]. Holmér's plan used a faster-than-race pace and concentrated on both speed and endurance training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://runningtimes.com/Article.aspx?ArticleID=5554 |title=Finding Fartlek: The history and how-to of speed play |first=Joe |last=Schatzle, Jr. |work=Running Times Magazine |date=November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First fartlek sessions ===
This is the first session that was designed by Gösta Holmér for a cross country (multi-terrain) runner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.runnersworld.com/workouts/finding-fartlek Schatzle, Jr., Joe (November 2002), Runner's World, "Finding Fartlek"]&lt;/ref&gt; This is also an example of what a fartlek session might look like, but fartlek sessions should be designed for an athlete's own event or sport, as well as catering to their individual needs. Sessions should be at an intensity that causes the athlete to work at 60% to 80% of his or her maximum heart rate.  This should mean that the body will not experience too much discomfort while exercising. An athlete should also include a good [[warming up|warm up]] at the beginning of the session, and a [[cool down]] at the end of the session, to improve performance, minimize post-workout muscle soreness, to decrease the chances of injury and for other reasons.
*Warm up: easy running for 5 to 10 minutes.
*Steady, hard speed for {{Convert|1.5|–|2.5|km|mi|1}}; like a long repetition.
*Recovery: rapid walking for about 5 minutes.
*Start of speed work: easy running interspersed with sprints of about {{Convert|50|&amp;ndash;|60|m|ft}}, repeated until a little tired.
*Easy running with three or four "quick steps" now and then (simulating suddenly speeding up to avoid being overtaken by another runner).
*Full speed uphill for {{Convert|175|–|200|m|ft|-1}}.
*Fast pace for 1 minute.
*The whole routine is then repeated until the total time prescribed on the training schedule has elapsed.

== Fartlek variations ==
=== Mailbox version ===
Runners hypothetically “run hard for two mailboxes, recover for three, run hard for three, recover for two." When executing this type, the runner continues like this for the allotted time or distance determined. &lt;ref name=shaw&gt;Shaw, Jené. "9 Ways To Fartlek." Triathlete.com. N.p., 11 Feb. 2014. Web. http://triathlon.competitor.com/2014/02/training/9-ways-to-fartlek_51140&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dog park version===
Runners speed up when they get close to a dog in order to pass them; after passing the dog, they would then slow down for the recovery period. &lt;ref name="shaw"/&gt;

=== Music version ===
Many runners use music while they run. &lt;ref&gt;Bean, Adam. "Running With Music." Runner's World &amp; Running Times. Runner's World, 1 Dec. 2010. Web. http://www.runnersworld.com/workout-music/running-music-0.&lt;/ref&gt; Runners can use their music as a template for their fartlek run by changing their speed according to different parts of a song. For example, they can speed up during the chorus and slow down for the rest of the song.

=== Three speeds version ===
In order to add more variety and complexity, runners can add another speed into the run. Within any run, “there is no reason why three different paces should not be included."&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie, Brain. "Fartlek Training." BrainMac Sports Coach. N.p., 10 Oct. 2014. Web. http://www.brianmac.co.uk/fartlek.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This would change a normal fartlek by doing a jog, run, and a full out sprint.

=== Mona fartlek ===
[[Steve Moneghetti]] (Mona) devised this session with his coach Chris Wardlaw over the phone back in 1983 when he was just 20. He wanted a solid fartlek session, one that would help improve his speed as well as endurance and stimulate an ability to change pace mid-run, something that helped later on his career when competing against African athletes, who tended to speed up mid-race. A session would consist of: 2×90sec, 4×60sec, 4×30sec, 4×15sec with a slower tempo for recovery of the same time between each repetition. The session takes 20&amp;nbsp;minutes in total.

== Benefits ==
=== Easily adjustable ===
Since this workout is very easily manipulated, “fartlek training allows you to add an endless variety of intervals to your aerobic workouts, which helps to keep you stimulated."&lt;ref name=benefits&gt;Hutchins, Michael. "What Are the Benefits of Fartlek Training?" LIVESTRONG.COM. LIVESTRONG.COM, 21 Oct. 2013. Web. http://www.livestrong.com/article/471208-what-are-the-benefits-of-fartlek-training/&lt;/ref&gt; A great plus to performing this workout is the variety it adds to fitness regimens; it is possible to change the amount of distance, time, fast bursts, recovery periods, and even the time at which you do each component.

=== Race day readiness ===
For competitive runners, fartleks and all other types of interval runs are the key for race day readiness. The alternating speeds that are the defining point of fartleks allow runners to work “both the aerobic and anaerobic training systems while simulating the ebb and flow nature of competitive running." &lt;ref name=kerkman&gt;Kerkman, Jill. "What the Fartlek?!" Breaking Muscle. Breaking Muscle, 2012. Web. http://breakingmuscle.com/running/what-the-fartlek&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Body strengthening ===
Fartleks keep runners' bodies at top shape so that they can keep racing. Putting fartlek runs in a workout routine keeps “muscles, tendons, nerves, etc. used in running going at top capacity."&lt;ref&gt;Galloway, Jeff. Cross-country Running. Aachen: Meyer &amp; Meyer Sport, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, regularly implementing fartleks keeps your body strong enough to maintain the mechanics of racing.

=== Fat burn ===
By alternating the “intensity of your workouts, you will burn more calories than you would by keeping a steady pace."&lt;ref name="benefits"/&gt; While running, the runner's body first burns the stored sugars and then begins to burn fat after the sugar is depleted. During a fartlek workout while the body is trying to replace the sugar storage, “fat stores are burned in a metabolic effect that lasts long after your workout."&lt;ref name="kerkman"/&gt; Fartleks are a great option for people that run for their health because the fat burning portion makes it a very efficient exercise.

=== Sports training variability ===
Fartleks can be specially tailored to fit the needs of different types of athletes. An example includes basketball, where “you must exert maximum effort while running a fast break, while you exert very little effort while standing at the foul line."&lt;ref name="benefits"/&gt; It is possible to alter the type and timing of the fartlek in order to mimic the intensity of an average basketball game. This can be done for other sports such as tennis, soccer, and football as well.

== Comparing other running exercises ==
Comparable runs include the traditional interval training, tempo runs, and ladders. These workouts are very similar to fartleks, but there are slight differences that distinguish one from another.

=== Tempo runs === 
Tempo runs are typically run for 20 to 25 minutes at a 6 or 7 [[Rating of perceived exertion|RPE]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://avenueform.com/benefits-of-long-distance-running-vs-sprints/ |title=Which Is Better between Running Faster or Longer? |last=Santos |first=Larissa |website=Avenue Form |date=14 June 2016 |access-date=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This exercise is “like an Oreo cookie, with the warmup and cooldown as the cookie, and a run at an effort at or slightly above your anaerobic threshold (the place where your body shifts to using more glycogen for energy) as the filling."&lt;ref name=compare&gt;Hadfield, Jenny. "What's the Difference Between Fartlek, Tempo, and Interval Runs?" Runner's World &amp; Running Times. N.p., 21 Nov. 2012. Web. http://www.runnersworld.com/race-training/whats-difference-between-fartlek-tempo-and-interval-runs&lt;/ref&gt; What runners do here is warm up at a slow and steady pace, then run harder than they would on a normal distance jog for an allotted amount of time, and then do a cool down with a very similar speed to the warm up. 

=== Interval runs === 
Intervals “are short, intense efforts followed by equal or slightly longer recovery time."&lt;ref name="compare"/&gt; By the end of a short burst of speed, the runner is barely able to keep up that pace. Unlike fartleks, interval runs are much more structured; usually running the fast and slow spurts at exact times or distances. Interval runs and tempo runs differ in the fact that tempo runs maintain a slightly fast pace for a set amount of time, while interval runs consist of alternating between sprints and slow sections instead of keeping one speed.

=== Ladders === 
This workout is defined as “a speed workout in which the fast parts vary in length." Basically, athletes will run a small amount at a hard pace, work their way up, and work their way back down with timed breaks in between. Ladders are similar to interval training in that they require more structure, but they are different because the faster speed sections vary in time or distance. Although ladders are most similar to interval runs, the fact that the portions performed at the faster speed vary in length or time mirrors fartlek runs.&lt;ref&gt;Rodgers, Bill, and Scott Douglas. The Complete Idiot's Guide to Jogging and Running. New York, NY: Alpha, 1998. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''flex model''' is a method of teaching for students who are [[Non-traditional student|non-traditional learners]]. [[Learning]] material and instructions are given online and the lessons are self-guided. The [[teacher]] is available on-site. The students work independently and learn to develop and create new concepts in a [[digital environment]]. They work in [[computer lab]]s most of the time. The schedules of learning modalities are customized individually and the teacher-of-record is on-site. Though most of the instructions are given online, the face-to-face support as needed by the student is given by the teacher-of-records and adults through activities such as group projects, small group instruction and individual [[tutoring]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=https://aspirepublicschools.org/media/filer_public/2013/07/22/aspire-blended-learning-handbook-2013.pdf |title=BLENDED LEARNING 101 |publisher=Webcache.googleusercontent.com |date=2013-07-22 |accessdate=2015-09-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226101305/http://aspirepublicschools.org/media/filer_public/2013/07/22/aspire-blended-learning-handbook-2013.pdf |archivedate=2015-02-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This model provides the students a flexible [[learning environment]]. They are free to arrive and leave the learning premises within the given timing of the day. The teacher in this model acts as a mentor and give equal importance in delivering the proper instruction to the students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.inacol.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/iNACOL_Blended-Learning-The-Evolution-of-Online-And-Face-to-Face-Education-from-2008-2015.pdf |title=Blending Learning: |publisher=Webcache.googleusercontent.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-19 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915122142/http://www.inacol.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/iNACOL_Blended-Learning-The-Evolution-of-Online-And-Face-to-Face-Education-from-2008-2015.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==
* Students will be able to carry out the learning process at their own pace.
* There is a facilitation of credit accumulation during the course of learning.
* The school operates at a lower cost compared to [[alternative school]]s.

==Disadvantages==
* Due to the lack of fixed schedules for the students to attend the classes, it is difficult for the school to accommodate the scheduling system.
* This model demands larger spaces and many devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://charterschoolconference.com/2013/handouts/Carrandi_Blended_Learning_Model.pdf |title=Model 1: ROTATION A.

'''Ger Brennan''' is an Irish [[Gaelic football]]er who plays for [[St Vincents GAA|St Vincents]] and formerly played for [[Dublin GAA|Dublin]].

==Early life==
From a family of nine, he attended [[Belvedere College]]. At Belvedere he played Rugby, soccer, hurling and Gaelic Football.

Graduating from [[Maynooth College]] with undergraduate and master's degrees, he qualified as a school teacher and taught Irish and religion at St. Kevin's College, Ballygall Road, in Dublin 11. In November 2015 he was appointed Gaelic Games Executive at [[University College Dublin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucd.ie/newsandopinion/news/gerbrennanappointedgaelicgamesexecutiveatucd/ Ger Brennan appointed Gaelic Games Executive at UCD] www.ucd.ie, November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Playing career==
===Club===
Brennan won his first [[Dublin Senior Football Championship]] medal with St Vincents in 2007 in the final against [[St Brigids]] at [[Parnell Park]]. He then went on to win the [[Leinster Senior Club Football Championship]] final against Tyrrellspass of [[Westmeath GAA|Westmeath]]. Brennan was chosen as the Leinster club player of the year for his performances in the Leinster club championship with St Vincents.

Brennan won the 2008 [[All-Ireland Senior Club Football Championship]] with [[St Vincents GAA|St Vincents]] in a hard fought game. He won the [[Dublin Senior Football Championship]] for St. Vincents, as captain, in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thescore.ie/st-vincents-dublin-football-champions-1164006-Nov2013/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131107123144/http://www.thescore.ie/st-vincents-dublin-football-champions-1164006-Nov2013/ |archivedate=2013-11-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inter-county===
Brennan madee his national league debut for Dublin against [[Tyrone GAA|Tyrone]] on 3 February 2007.  He was a member of Dublin team that won the [[2007 O'Byrne Cup|2007]] [[O'Byrne Cup]], playing against Laois at [[O'Connor Park]] in Offaly. The game finished on a scoreline of 1-18 to 2-13.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.breakingnews.ie/sport/?jp=CWSNOJEYAUQL]&lt;/ref&gt; He finished the tournament with a total of 0-04.

In 2008, he retired from Dublin's football panel, citing burnout and fatigue as his reasons. However, on July 30, 2008, he was named in Dublin's panel for the quarter-final and accepted a return. He was part of the victorious Dublin squad that won the 2011 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship. He won an All-Ireland with Dublin for a second time in 2013, scoring two points in the final against Mayo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-football/dublin-are-all-ireland-champions-29597446.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, Brennan announced his retirement from Inter County football but will continue to play club football.

==Personal life==
Brennan is a Catholic who has spoken about his faith in God. He has stated that while non-denominational schools may teach subjects such as science, Catholic schools "enable young students to have the skills to pray".&lt;ref name=time_to_learn_about_faith&gt;{{cite news|first=Pamela|last=Duncan|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/religion-and-beliefs/ger-brennan-says-time-for-young-people-to-learn-more-about-faith-1.1661808|title=Ger Brennan says time for young people to learn more about faith: Catholic Schools Week 2014 begins next Sunday, January 26th|work=The Irish Times|date=20 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brennan was praised for his "nonchalant delivery" of thanks to the "girlfriends and boyfriends of the players" after St Vincent's defeated Castlebar Mitchels in the 2014 All-Ireland Club Championship Final at Croke Park (a speech delivered in front of a live television audience).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26646416|title=Ger Brennan's 'inclusive' speech praised by gay rights groups|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=19 March 2014|accessdate=19 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However just over a year later, Brennan wrote an op-ed for the ''[[Irish Independent]]'' arguing against the legalisation of [[same-sex marriage]] in that year's [[Thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Marriage Equality referendum]], which was ultimately carried in a 62% to 38% popular vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ger|last=Brennan|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/referendum/dublin-football-star-ger-brennan-why-im-voting-no-31217917.html|title=Dublin football star Ger Brennan: Why I'm voting No|newspaper=Irish Independent|date=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His stance was criticised by others, including fellow GAA star [[Conor Cusack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Adam|last=Cullen|url=http://www.herald.ie/news/conor-cusack-challenges-dubs-star-ger-brennan-on-opposition-to-samesex-marriage-31220546.html|title=Conor Cusack challenges Dubs star Ger Brennan on opposition to same-sex marriage|newspaper=Evening Herald|date=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9042">'''Gifted pull-outs''' (also called "send-out" or "resource" programs) are an educational approach in which gifted students are removed (or "pulled-out") from a heterogeneous (mixed-ability) classroom to spend a portion of their time with academic peers.  Pull-outs tend to meet one to two hours per week.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Karen B, Ph.D., ''Re-forming Gifted Education'' (Great Potential Press, Scottsdale, AZ, 2002), pp. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; The students meet with a teacher to engage in enrichment or extension activities that may or may not be related to the curriculum being taught in the regular classroom. Pull-out teachers in some states are not required to have any formal background in gifted education.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.davidsongifted.org/db/StatePolicy.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Research has suggested that there are benefits to grouping gifted children together for the majority of the school day,&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Karen B, Ph.D., ''The Relationship of Grouping Practices to the Education of the Gifted and Talented Learner'', (The National Research Center on the Gifted and Talented, 1991 ) p. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; which suggests that the limited meeting times and durations of gifted pull-out groups may have limited benefits for the gifted children. A 1993 U.S. Government report found up to 72% of school districts using the pull-out approach despite this method being generally unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;"Part II. The Current Status of Education for the Nation's Most Talented Students," in ''National Excellence: A Case for Developing America's Talent (online). Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Education, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;  This lack of effectiveness has been echoed in more recent literature.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Jan and Bob, with Vanderkam, Laura (Simon &amp; Schuster Paperbacks, NY, NY, 2004) ''Genius Denied: How to Stop Wasting Our Brightest Young Minds'', p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, Borland (2003) concludes that pull-out programming is generally unproductive.&lt;ref&gt;Borland, James, ed., "The Death of Giftedness", ''Rethinking Gifted Education'' (New York: Teachers College Press, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, this is because pull-outs are composed of a hodge-podge of critical thinking, logic puzzles, and random subjects (like mythology) which are unlikely to result in any significant academic progress because they are not tied directly to the core curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, ''Re-forming...'', p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;  Winebrenner (2001) recommends those same ineffective practices, including creative problem solving, chess, logic puzzles, and academic competitions.&lt;ref&gt;Winebrenner, Susan, Teaching Gifted Kids in the Regular Classroom (Free Spirit Publishing, Inc, Minneapolis, MN, 2001), p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;  Oddly, Winebrenner also recommends that students selected for pull-out should be those who are capable in the areas the pull-out will address.&lt;ref&gt;Winebrenner, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is exactly the opposite of the approach recommended by most gifted literature, which argues for matching the instruction ''to the student,'' not vice versa.  Jan and Bob Davidson of the [[Davidson Institute for Talent Development]] criticize pull-outs in their book, ''Genius Denied: How to Stop Wasting Our Brightest Young Minds.''  On page 47, they say, "Most pull-out programs provide little beyond a creative outlet--and since districts that offer such programs claim they are helping gifted children when they aren't, they are often worse than no programs at all." Matthews and Foster also criticize pull-out gifted classes. They claim that the learning needs of advanced students are too important to be restricted to the day(s) on which their gifted class is scheduled. Furthermore, as they also point out, students can be penalized for missing their regular class (for example, by missing a class field trip), and sometimes teachers resent the pull-out teacher taking the strongest students out of their class. And perhaps most worrisome, the work in withdrawal gifted classes is often not differentiated for learning needs or properly integrated into children’s other studies.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, D. and Foster, J. (2009). ''[http://beyondintelligence.net/books/being-smart/ Being Smart about Gifted Education]''. &lt;/ref&gt; However, pull-out programs, when properly implemented, can be used to complement [[cluster grouping]]&lt;ref&gt;Winebrenner, Susan, and Devlin, Barbara, ''Cluster Grouping Fact Sheet: How to Provide Full-Time Services for Gifted Students on Limited Budgets''&lt;/ref&gt; and other in-class [[differentiated instruction|differentiation]].

==Success Factors/Recommendations==
* The content covered in gifted pull-outs should be academically beyond the ability of the students' regular classmates.  If other students could do the work, they should be allowed to participate.&lt;ref&gt;Winebrenner, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The regular class should be informed that pull-out participation does not make another student a better person.  Similarly, participants should be discouraged from bragging.&lt;ref&gt;Winebrenner, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Regular classroom teachers should not schedule tests, special events, or new topics during the pull-out.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, ''Re-forming...'', p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt;  Pull-out students can prove their mastery of the regular classroom material by answering a small subset of the problems containing the most challenging material.&lt;ref&gt;Winebrenner, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A single, larger block of time is preferable to two or more smaller blocks.&lt;ref&gt;Winebrenner, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The gifted specialist needs time to communicate with other teachers to map the extension and enrichment work to the core curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, J., Daniel, N., &amp; Boston, B., (1985). ''Educating able learners: Programs and promising practices.'' Austin, TX: University of Texas&lt;/ref&gt;  Research shows that such systematic extension can result in substantial academic gains.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughn, V.L., Feldhusen, J.F., &amp; Asher, J.W. (1991).  Meta-analyses and review of research on pull-out programs in gifted education.  ''Gifted Child Quarterly, 35'', pp. 92-98.&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar gains in critical and creative thinking can be made in annual programs for those topics.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughn et al.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A 90-minute one-size-fits-all solution for every gifted child is inappropriate. Pull-outs must be part of a larger context including in-class [[differentiated instruction|differentiation]], [[independent study]], subject and whole-grade [[Academic acceleration|acceleration]] (grade skipping), [[Distance education|distance learning]], [[dual enrollment]], [[Advanced Placement|AP]] courses, and [[mentorship]].&lt;ref&gt;Davidsons, pp. 164-165.&lt;/ref&gt;  The gifted specialist should work with the regular classroom teacher to design these accommodations.&lt;ref&gt;Winebrenner, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Pull-outs should encourage struggling to learn, facing challenges, and learning from mistakes,&lt;ref&gt;Winebrenner, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Assigning pull-out homework is advantageous.&lt;ref&gt;Winebrenner, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Pull-outs are an effective venue for working on social and emotional issues and interpersonal skill deficits encountered by gifted children.&lt;ref&gt;Winebrenner, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Pull-outs are generally more successful in elementary school because middle and high school scheduling becomes problematic and the higher grades typically offer more options for advanced work and extracurriculars than the lower grades.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, ''Re-forming...'', p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Difficulties==
* Pull-outs may be perceived erroneously by parents, teachers, and administrators as the entire solution to gifted education, while they should actually play a supplementary role to daily differentiated work in the regular classroom.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, ''Re-forming...'', p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Children are often expected to make up work that was missed during pull-out,&lt;ref&gt;Cox, et al.&lt;/ref&gt; which frequently is not challenging to them to begin with.
* Communication with the regular classroom teacher can break down.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, et al.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Regular educators may resent the specialist and the program.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, et al.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The pull-out curriculum may be viewed as ''fluff,''&lt;ref&gt;Cox, et al.&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps justifiably so.
* Regular educators may resent the missing of important classwork.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, et al.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Regular educators may feel that they could teach the gifted children as well as the specialist.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''K-5''' (pronounced "kay through five") is an [[United States|American]]  term for the [[education]] period from [[kindergarten]] to [[fifth grade]].  It receives equal amounts of criticism and support in the educational industry.  While many [[early childhood]] experts deem it too closely aligned with more developmentally inappropriate "watered-down" early elementary teaching methods, [[Administration (government)|administrator]]s and policy-makers see it as a way to integrate kindergarten under the guise of the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] of 2001.

The '''Knowledge Building''' (KB) theory was created and developed by [[Carl Bereiter]] and [[Marlene Scardamalia]] for describing what a community of learners needs to accomplish in order to create [[knowledge]]. The theory addresses the need to educate people for the [[knowledge society|knowledge age society]], in which knowledge and [[innovation]] are pervasive.&lt;ref name=sb2003&gt;(Scardamalia &amp; Bereiter, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

Knowledge building may be defined simply as "the creation, testing, and improvement of [[concept]]ual artifacts. It is not confined to education but applies to creative knowledge work of all kinds".&lt;ref&gt;(Bereiter &amp; Scardamalia, 2003, p. 13)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Scardamalia &amp; Bereiter distinguish between knowledge building and [[learning]]. They see learning as an internal, (almost) unobservable process that results in changes of beliefs, attitudes, or skills. By contrast, KB is seen as creating or modifying [[public knowledge]]. KB produces knowledge that lives ‘in the world’, and is available to be worked on and used by other people.

A good way to understand the difference between learning and knowledge building is by considering mathematics and [[scientific content]]s as examples of public knowledge. Furthermore, Bereiter in his book on Education and Mind (2002) based his observation of the educational value of KB on [[Karl Popper]]'s ontological analysis of our existence as made up of [[Popper's three worlds|three interacting worlds]]: World 1 (the physical), World 2 (the [[Subjectivity|subjective]]) and World 3 (the locus of [[cultural product]]s). Thus, learning takes place in World 2, while knowledge is built in World 3.&lt;ref&gt;(Popper, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

Knowledge building refers to the process of creating new cognitive artifacts as a result of common goals, group discussions, and synthesis of ideas. These pursuits should advance the current understanding of individuals within a group, at a level beyond their initial knowledge level, and should be directed towards advancing the understanding of what is known about that topic or idea. The theory "encompasses the foundational learning, subskills, and socio-cognitive dynamics pursued in other approaches, along with the additional benefit of movement along the trajectory to mature education".&lt;ref&gt;(Scardamalia &amp; Bereiter, 2003, p. 5)&lt;/ref&gt;

Knowledge building can be considered as ''deep [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]]'' &lt;ref name=sc2002&gt;(Scardamalia, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; that involves making a collective inquiry into a specific topic, and coming to a deeper understanding through interactive questioning, dialogue, and continuing improvement of ideas. Ideas are thus the medium of operation in KB environments. The teacher becomes a guide, rather than a director, and allows students to take over a significant portion of the responsibility for their own learning, including planning, execution, and evaluation.&lt;ref name=sc2002/&gt;

One of the hallmarks of KB is a sense of ''we'' superseding the sense of ''I'', a feeling that the group is operating collectively, and not just as an assemblage of individuals. [[Computer-mediated communication|Discussion software]] can enable such an environment, one being [[Knowledge Forum]], which supports many of the prerequisite processes of KB. Bereiter and colleagues &lt;ref&gt;(1997, p. 12)&lt;/ref&gt; state that Knowledge building projects focus on understanding rather than on accomplishing tasks, and on collaboration rather than on controversy.

Setting children on a KB trajectory is a promising foundation for education in the knowledge age.&lt;ref name=sb2003/&gt;

== Principles of Knowledge building ==
Scardamalia (2002)&lt;ref name=sc2002/&gt; identifies twelve principles of KB as follows:

# ''Real ideas and authentic problems.'' In the [[classroom]] as a [[Knowledge building community]], learners are concerned with understanding, based on their real problems in the real world.
# ''Improvable ideas.'' Students' ideas are regarded as improvable objects.
# ''Idea diversity.'' In the classroom, the diversity of ideas raised by students is necessary.
# ''Rise above.'' Through a sustained improvement of ideas and understanding, students create higher level concepts.
# ''Epistemic agency.'' Students themselves find their way in order to advance.
# ''Community knowledge, [[collective responsibility]].'' Students' contribution to improving their collective knowledge in the classroom is the primary purpose of the KB classroom.
# ''Democratizing knowledge.'' All individuals are invited to contribute to the knowledge advancement in the classroom.
# ''Symmetric knowledge advancement.'' A goal for Knowledge building communities is to have individuals and organizations actively working to provide a reciprocal advance of their knowledge.
# ''Pervasive Knowledge building.'' Students contribute to collective KB.
# ''Constructive uses of authoritative sources.'' All members, including the teacher, sustain inquiry as a natural approach to support their understanding.
# ''Knowledge building discourse.'' Students are engaged in discourse to share with each other, and to improve the knowledge advancement in the classroom.
# ''Concurrent, embedded, and transformative assessment.'' Students take a global view of their understanding, then decide how to approach their assessments. They create and engage in assessments in a variety of ways.

'''Language attrition''' is the process of losing a [[First language|native, or first, language]]. This process is generally caused by both isolation from speakers of the first language and the acquisition and use of a [[second language]], which interferes with the correct production and comprehension of the first. Such [[Language transfer|interference]] from a second language is likely experienced to some extent by all [[Multilingualism|bilinguals]], but is most evident among speakers for whom a language other than their first has started to play an important, if not dominant, role in everyday life; these speakers are at a higher risk for experiencing language attrition.&lt;ref name="let.rug.nl"&gt;[http://www.let.rug.nl/languageattrition/Papers/Schmid%20&amp;%20Kopke%202007.pdf Köpke, Barbara., Schimd, Monika (2007) Rijksuniversiteit Groningen, The Netherlands/Laboratoire de Neuropsycholinguistique, Université de Toulouse, Le Mirail, France "Bilingualism and Attrition"]&lt;/ref&gt; A notable example of this is found in immigrants, who may move to a country in which a language foreign to them is spoken, and go on to use that later-learned environmental language in their daily lives. Their gradual decline in proficiency in their first language, or L1, resulting from both isolation from other speakers of their L1 and interference from the L2 they are acquiring, is considered language attrition.

There are a number of factors which may affect the process of L1 attrition. Frequent exposure and use of a particular language is often assumed adequate to maintain the native language system intact. However, research has often failed to confirm this prediction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://babylonia.ch/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/2008-2/schmid_01.pdf Schimd, Monika (2008) Rijksuniversiteit Groningen, The Netherlands "Defining Language Attrition"]&lt;/ref&gt; A positive attitude towards the potentially attriting language or its speech community and motivation to retain the language are other factors which may reduce the effects of attrition.

Language attrition results in a decrease of language proficiency from what was previously acquired. The current consensus is that attrition manifests itself first and most noticeably in the vocabulary knowledge of speakers (in their lexical access and their mental lexicon)&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Schmid, M.

==Study==
The term ''first language attrition'' (FLA) refers to the gradual decline in native language proficiency. As speakers use their L2 frequently and become proficient (or even dominant) in it, some aspects of the L1 can deteriorate or become subject to L2 influence.

The study of language attrition became a subfield of linguistics with a 1980 conference at the University of Pennsylvania called "Loss of Language Skills".&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, Richard D., Freed, Barbara F.. 1982.&amp;nbsp;''The Loss of language skills''. The University of California&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of the conference was to discuss areas of second language, or L2, attrition and to ideate on possible future research. The conference revealed that attrition is a wide topic, with numerous factors and taking many forms. Decades later, the field of first language attrition gained new momentum with two conferences held in Amsterdam in 2002 and 2005, as well as a series of graduate workshops and panels at international conferences, such as the International Symposium on Bilingualism (2007, 2009), the annual conferences of the European Second Language Association, and the AILA World Congress (2008). The outcomes of some of these meetings were later published in edited volumes.&lt;ref name="Shmid, Monika 2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shmid | first1 = Monika | year = 2004 | title = First language attrition: The methodology revised | url = | journal = International Journal of Bilingualism | volume = 8 | issue = 3| pages = 239–255 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="let.rug.nl"/&gt;

To study the process of language attrition, researchers initially looked at neighboring areas of linguistics to identify which parts of the L1 system attrite first; lacking years of experimental data of attrition itself, linguists studied [[language contact]], [[Creole genesis|creolization]], [[Second-language acquisition|L2 acquisition]], and [[aphasia]], and applied their findings to language acquisition.&lt;ref name="Shmid, Monika 2004"/&gt;

One issue that is faced when researching attrition is distinguishing between normal L2 influence on the L1 and actual attrition of the L1. Since all bilinguals experience some degree of [[Crosslinguistic influence|cross linguistic influence]], where the L2 interferes with the retrieval of the speaker's L1, it is difficult to determine if delays and/or mistakes in the L1 are due to attrition or cause by CLI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Larsen-Freeman | first1 = D. | last2 = Schmid | first2 = M. S. | last3 = Lowie | first3 = W. | year = 2011 | title = Introduction: From structure to chaos.&amp;nbsp; | url = | journal = Modeling Bilingualism Studies in Bilingualism | volume =  | issue = | pages =  1–12| doi = 10.1075/sibil.43.02intro }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, simultaneous bilinguals may not have a language that is indistinguishable from that of a native speaker or a language where their knowledge of it is less extensive than a native speaker's; therefore testing for attrition is difficult.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt;

==Manifestations==
===Lexical attrition===

The first linguistic system to be affected by first language attrition is the lexicon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Köpke | first1 = B. | last2 = Schimd | first2 = M. S. | last3 = Keijzer | first3 = M. C. | last4 = Dostert | first4 = S. | year = 2007 | title = Language attrition: theoretical perspectives | url = | journal = Studies in Bilingualism | volume =  | issue = | page =  | doi = 10.1075/sibil.33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lexical-semantic relationship usually starts to deteriorate first and most quickly, driven by Cross Linguistic Interference (CLI) from the attriter's L2, and it is believed to be exacerbated by continued exposure to, and frequent use of, the L2.&lt;ref name="Schmid, M. S. 2014"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmid | first1 = M. S. | last2 = Jarvis | first2 = S. | year = 2014 | title = Lexical access and lexical diversity in first language attrition | url = | journal = Bilingualism: Language and Cognition | volume = 17 | issue = 04| pages = 729–748 | doi = 10.1017/s1366728913000771 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence for such interlanguage effects can be seen in a study by Pavlenko (2003, 2004) which shows that there was some semantic extension from the L2, which was English, into the L1 Russian speakers' lexicons. In order to test for lexical attrition, researchers use tests such as picture naming tasks, where they place a picture of an item in front of the participant and ask them to name it, or by measuring lexical diversity in the speaker's spontaneous speech (speech that is unprompted and improvised). In both cases, attriters performed worse than non-attriters.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Ammerlaan, T. (1996). "You get a bit wobbly...": exploring bilingual lexical retrieval processes in the context of first language attrition. Nijmegen, Netherlands: S.n.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Hulsen, M. (2000). Language loss and language processing: three generations of Dutch migrants in New Zealand. S.l.: S.n&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Montrul | first1 = S. A. | year = 2009 | title = Incomplete acquisition in bilingualism: re-examining the age factor | url = | journal = Studies in Bilingualism| volume =  | issue = | page =  | doi = 10.1075/sibil.39 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmid | first1 = M. S. | year = 2002 | title = First Language Attrition, Use and Maintenance | url = | journal = Studies in Bilingualism | volume = 24 | issue = | page = 258 | doi = 10.1075/sibil.24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One hypothesis suggests that when a speaker tries to access a lexical item from their L1 they are also competing with the translation equivalents of their L2 and that there is either a problem with activating the L1 due to infrequent use or with the inhibition of the competing L2.&lt;ref name="Schmid, M. S. 2014"/&gt;

===Grammatical attrition===

Grammatical attrition can be defined as "the disintegration of the structure of a first language (L1) in contact situations with a second language (L2)".&lt;ref&gt;Seliger, H. W., &amp; Vago, R. M. (1991). First language attrition. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In a study of bilingual Swedes raised outside of Sweden, who in their late twenties returned to their home country for schooling, there was noted to be attrition of their L1. The participants demonstrated a complete retention of the underlying syntactic structure of their L1. Notably, they exhibited the V2, verb second, word order present in most Germanic languages, except English. This rule requires the tense-marked verb of a main clause to occur in the second position of the sentence, even if that means it comes before the subject (e.g. there is an adverb at the beginning of the sentence). These speakers' ability to form sentences with V2 word order was compared against L2 learners who often overproduce the rigid SVO word order rather than applying the V2 rule. Although the study did not show evidence for attrition of syntax of the person's L1, there was evidence for attrition in the expatriates' morphology, especially in terms of agreement. They found that the bilinguals would choose to use the unmarked morphemes in place of the marked one when having to differentiate between gender and plurality; also they tend to overgeneralize where certain morphemes can be used. For example, they may use the suffix /-a/, which is used to express an indefinite plural, and overextend this morpheme to also represent the indefinite singular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Håkansson | first1 = G | year = 1995 | title = Syntax and morphology in language attrition: a study of five bilingual expatriate Swedes | url = | journal = International Journal of Applied Linguistics | volume = 5 | issue = 2| pages = 153–169 | doi = 10.1111/j.1473-4192.1995.tb00078.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is little evidence to support the view that there is a complete restructuring of the language systems. That is, even under language attrition the syntax is largely unaffected and any variability observed is thought to be due to interference from another language, rather than attrition.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Tsimpli, I., Sorace, A., Heycock, C., &amp; Filiaci, F. (2004). First language attrition and syntactic subjects: a study of Greek and Italian near-native speakers of English" ''International Journal of Bilingualism'' 8(3), 257-277. Retrieved from http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~antonell/TsimpliSoraceHeycockFiliaci2004.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tsimpli | first1 = I.

L1 attriters, like L2 learners, may use language differently from native speakers. In particular, they can have variability on certain rules which native speakers apply deterministically.&lt;ref&gt;Sorace, A. 2005. "Selective optionality in language development". In: Cornips, L. &amp; Corrigan, K. P., (eds.),&amp;nbsp;''Syntax and Variation: reconciling the biological and the social'', pp.&amp;nbsp;55–80 Amsterdam/Philadelphia: John Benjamins.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; In the context of attrition, however, there is strong evidence that this optionality is not indicative of any underlying representational deficits: the same individuals do not appear to encounter recurring problems with the same kinds of grammatical phenomena in different speech situations or on different tasks.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; This suggests that problems of L1 attriters are due to momentary conflicts between the two linguistic systems and not indicative of a structural change to underlying linguistic knowledge (that is, to an emerging representational deficit of any kind). This assumption is in line with a range of investigations of L1 attrition which argue that this process may affect interface phenomena (e.g. the distribution of overt and null subjects in pro-drop languages) but will not touch the narrow syntax.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Montrul, S. 2004. "Convergent outcomes in L2 acquisition and L1 loss". In: Schmid, M. S., Köpke, B., Keijzer, M. &amp; Weilemar, L. (eds.),&amp;nbsp;''First Language Attrition: interdisciplinary perspectives on methodological issues''&amp;nbsp;(pp.&amp;nbsp;259–279). Amsterdam: John Benjamins.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Montrul, S. 2008.&amp;nbsp;''Incomplete Acquisition in Bilingualism: re-examining the age factor''. Amsterdam: John Benjamins.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phonological attrition===

Phonological attrition is a form of language loss that affects the speaker's ability to produce their native language with their native accent. A study of five native speakers of American English who moved to Brazil and learned Portuguese as their L2 demonstrates the possibility that one could lose one's L1 accent in place of an accent that is directly influenced by the L2.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} It is thought that phonological loss can occur to those who are closer to native-like fluency in the L2, especially in terms of phonological production, and for those who have immersed themselves and built a connection to the culture of the country for the L2.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} A sociolinguistic approach to this phenomenon is that the acquisition of a native-like L2 accent and the subsequent loss of one's native accent is influenced by the societal norms of the country and the speakers' attempt to adapt in order to feel a part of the culture they are trying to assimilate into.&lt;ref&gt;Major, R. (1994). Sociolinguistic factors in loss and acquisition of phonology. In K. Hyltenstam &amp; A. Viberg (Eds.), Progression and Regression in Language: Sociocultural, Neuropsychological and Linguistic Perspectives (pp. 463-478). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{DOI|10.1017/CBO9780511627781.019}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of attrition is not to be confused with contact-induced change since that would mean speech production changes due to an increased use of another language and not due to the less frequent use of the L1.&lt;ref&gt;Yeh, C., &amp; Lin, Y. (2015). Tonal Change Induced by Language Attrition and Phonetic Similarity in Hai-lu Hakka. Prosody and Language in Contact Prosody, Phonology and Phonetics, 189-220. {{DOI|10.1007/978-3-662-45168-7_10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studies and hypotheses==
Lambert and Moore&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, R. D. &amp; Moore, S. J. (1986). "Problem Areas in the Study of Language Attrition". In: Weltens, B., de Bot, K. &amp; van Els, T. (eds.),&amp;nbsp;''Language Attrition in Progress, Studies on Language Acquisition''&amp;nbsp;(p.&amp;nbsp;177 – p.&amp;nbsp;186). Dordrecht, NL: Foris Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; attempted to define numerous hypotheses regarding the nature of language loss, crossed with various aspects of language. They envisioned a test to be given to American [[State Department]] employees that would include four linguistic categories ([[syntax]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[lexicon]], and [[phonology]]) and three skill areas ([[reading (activity)|reading]], [[listening]], and [[Speech communication|speaking]]). A translation component would feature on a sub-section of each skill area tested. The test was to include linguistic features that are the most difficult, according to teachers, for students to master. Such a test may confound testing what was not acquired with what was lost. Lambert, in personal communication with Köpke and Schmid,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; described the results as 'not substantial enough to help much in the development of the new field of language skill attrition'.

The use of translation tests to study language loss is inappropriate for a number of reasons: it is questionable what such tests measure; too much [[Variation (linguistics)|variation]]; the difference between attriters and [[multilingualism|bilinguals]] is complex; activating two languages at once may cause interference. Yoshitomi&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Yoshitomi, A. (1992). "Towards a Model of Language Attrition: neurological and psychological contributions". In:&amp;nbsp;''Issues in Applied Linguistics''; Vol 3, No 2: 293-318.&lt;/ref&gt; attempted to define a model of language attrition that was related to [[neurological]] and [[psychological]] aspects of language learning and unlearning. She discussed four possible hypotheses and five key aspects related to acquisition and attrition. The hypotheses are:
* 1. Reverse order: last learned, first forgotten. Studies by Russell&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Robert (1999). "Lexical maintenance and attrition in Japanese as a second language". In: Hansen, Lynne (ed.).''Second Language Attrition: evidence from Japanese contexts''&amp;nbsp;(p.&amp;nbsp;114 – p.&amp;nbsp;141). Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and Hayashi&lt;ref&gt;Hayashi, Brenda (1999). "Testing the regression hypotheis: the remains of the Japanese negation system in Micronesia". In: Hansen, Lynne (ed.).&amp;nbsp;''Second Language Attrition: evidence from Japanese contexts''&amp;nbsp;(p.&amp;nbsp;154 – p.&amp;nbsp;168). Oxford: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; both looked at the Japanese negation system and both found that attrition was the reverse order of acquisition. Yoshitomi and others, including Yukawa,&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;Yukawa, E. (1998).&amp;nbsp;''L1 Japanese Attrition and Regaining: three case studies of two early bilingual children''. Tokyo: Kurosio Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; argue that attrition can occur so rapidly, it is impossible to determine the order of loss.
* 2. Inverse relation: better learned, better retained. Language items that are acquired first also happen to be those that are most reinforced. As a result, hypotheses 1 and 2 ''capture the main linguistic characteristics of language attrition''&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;
* 3. Critical period: at or around age 9. As a child grows, he becomes less able to master native-like abilities. Furthermore, various linguistic features (for example phonology or syntax) may have different stages or age limits for mastering. Hyltenstam &amp; Abrahamsson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hyltenstam | first1 = K. | last2 = Viberg | first2 = A. | year = 1994 | title = Progression &amp; Regression in Language: sociocultural, neuropsychological, &amp; linguistic perspectives | url = | journal = | volume =  | issue = | page =  | doi = 10.1017/cbo9780511627781 }}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that after childhood, in general, it becomes more and more difficult to acquire "native-like-ness", but that there is no cut-off point in particular. Furthermore, they discuss a number of cases where a native-like L2 was acquired during adulthood.
* 4. Affect: motivation and attitude.

According to Yoshitomi,&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; the five key aspects related to attrition are [[neuroplasticity]], consolidation, [[permastore]]/savings, decreased accessibility, and receptive versus productive abilities.

=== The regression hypothesis ===
The regression hypothesis, first formulated by Roman Jakobson in 1941 and originally formulated on the phonology of only Slavic languages,&lt;ref name=":52"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=7i8ZLfGKcjcC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=de+Bot,+K.+%26+B.+Weltens+(1991).+Recapitulation,+regression,+and+language+loss.+In+SELIGER+%26+VAGO+(eds),+31-51.&amp;ots=vX7Qy11wyl&amp;sig=Oe1D7OsTmyLCi7QLBl-cesHMuLE#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false De Bot (1991)] De Bot, K., &amp; Weltens, B. (1991). Recapitulation, regression, and language loss. First language attrition, 31-51.&lt;/ref&gt; goes back to the beginnings of psychology and psychoanalysis. It states that that which was learned first will be retained last, both in 'normal' processes of forgetting and in pathological conditions such as aphasia or dementia.&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt; As a template for language attrition, the regression hypothesis has long seemed an attractive paradigm. However, regression is not in itself a theoretical or explanatory framework.&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keijzer | first1 = M | year = 2007 | title = Last in first out?: An investigation of the regression hypothesis in Dutch emigrants in Anglophone Canada | url = | journal = Toegepaste Taalwetenschap in Artikelen | volume = 78 | issue = 1| pages = 131–139 | doi=10.1075/ttwia.78.12kei}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both order of acquisition and order of attrition need to be put into the larger context of linguistic theory in order to gain explanatory adequacy.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keijzer | first1 = M | year = 2010 | title = The regression hypothesis as a framework for first language attrition | url = | journal = Bilingualism: Language and Cognition | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 9–18 | doi=10.1017/s1366728909990356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keijzer (2007) conducted a study on the attrition of Dutch in Anglophone Canada. She finds some evidence that later-learned rules, such as diminutive and plural formation, indeed erode before earlier learned grammatical rules.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; However, there is also considerable interaction between the first and second language and so a straightforward 'regression pattern' cannot be observed.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; Also, parallels in noun and verb phrase morphology could be present because of the nature of the tests or because of avoidance by the participants.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; In a follow up 2010 article, Keijzer suggests that the regression hypothesis may be more applicable to morphology than to syntax.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Citing the studies on the regression hypothesis that have been done, Yukawa&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; says that the results have been contradictory. It is possible that attrition is a case-by-case situation depending on a number of variables (age, proficiency,&amp; [[literacy]], the similarities between the L1 and L2, and whether the L1 or the L2 is attriting). The [[threshold hypothesis]] states that there may be a level of proficiency that once attained, enables the attriting language to remain stable.

== Factors ==

===Age effect===
Children are more susceptible to (first) language attrition than adults.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; Research shows an age effect around the ages of 8 through 13.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Before this time period, a first language can attrite under certain circumstances, the most prominent being a sudden decline in exposure to the first language. Various case studies show that children who emigrate before puberty and have little to no exposure to their first language end up losing the first language. In 2009, a study compared two groups of Swedish-speaking groups: native Swedish speakers and Korean international adoptees who were at risk for losing their Korean.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hyltenstam | first1 = K. | last2 = Bylund | first2 = E. | last3 = Abrahamsson | first3 = N. | last4 = Park | first4 = H. S. | year = 2009 | title = Dominant-language replacement: The case of international adoptees | url = | journal = Bilingualism: Language and Cognition | volume = 12 | issue = 2| pages = 121–140 | doi=10.1017/s1366728908004008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the Korean adoptees, those who were adopted the earliest essentially lost their Korean and those adopted later still retained some of it, although it was primarily their comprehension of Korean that was spared.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A 2007 study looked at Korean adoptees in France and found that they performed on par with native French speakers in French proficiency and Korean.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1615/ab35ebe2c40dfbb5463b3e1a66b67a6c3563.pdf Pallier 2007] Pallier, C. (2007). Critical periods in language acquisition and language attrition. Language attrition: Theoretical perspectives, 155-168.&lt;/ref&gt;

Attrition of a first language does not guarantee an advantage in learning a second language.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Attriters are outperformed by native speakers of the second language in proficiency.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A 2009 study tested the Swedish proficiency of Swedish speakers who had attrited knowledge of Spanish. These participants did show almost but not quite native-like proficiency when compared to native Swedish speakers, and they did not show an advantage when compared with bilingual Swedish-Spanish speakers.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

On the other hand, L1 attrition may also occur if the overall effort to maintain the first language is insufficient while exposed to a dominant L2 environment. Another recent investigation, focussing on the development of language in late bilinguals (i.e. adults past puberty), has claimed that maintenance of the mother tongue in an L1 environment requires little to no maintenance for individuals, whereas those in the L2 environment have an additive requirement for the maintenance of the L1 and the development of the L2 (Optiz, 2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Opitz|first=Conny|date=2013-12-01|title=A dynamic perspective on late bilinguals' linguistic development in an L2 environment|url=http://ijb.sagepub.com/content/17/6/701|journal=International Journal of Bilingualism|language=en|volume=17|issue=6|pages=701–715|doi=10.1177/1367006912454621|issn=1367-0069}}&lt;/ref&gt;

there have been cases in which adults have undergone first language attrition. A 2011 study tested adult monolingual English speakers, adult monolingual Russian speakers and adult bilingual English-Russian speakers on naming various liquid containers (cup, glass, mug, etc.) in both English and Russian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pavlenko|first=Aneta|last2=Malt|first2=Barbara C.|date=2011|title=Kitchen Russian: Cross-linguistic differences and first-language object naming by Russian-English bilinguals|url=|journal=Bilingualism: Language and Cognition|volume=14|pages=19–45|doi=10.1017/s136672891000026x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results showed that the bilinguals had attrited Russian vocabulary because they did not label these liquid containers the same way as the monolingual Russian speakers. When grouped according to Age of Acquisition (AoA) of English, the bilinguals showed an effect of AoA (or perhaps length of exposure to the L2) in that bilinguals with earlier AoA (mean AoA 3.4 years) exhibited much stronger attrition than bilinguals with later AoA (mean AoA 22.8 years). That is, the individuals with earlier AoA were the more different from monolingual Russian speakers in their labeling and categorization of drinking vessels, than the people with later AoA. However, even the late AoA bilinguals exhibited some degree of attrition in that they labeled the drinking vessels differently from native monolingual Russian-speaking adults.

==== Critical period hypothesis ====
Given that exposure to an L2 at a younger age typically leads to stronger attrition of the L1 than L2 exposure at later ages, there may be a relationship between language attrition and the [[critical period hypothesis]]. The critical period for language claims that there is an optimal time period for humans to acquire language, and after this time language acquisition is more difficult (though not impossible). Language attrition also seems to have a time period; before around age 12, a first language is most susceptible to attrition if there is reduced exposure to that language.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Research shows that the complete attrition of a language would occur before the critical period ends.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

All available evidence on the age effect for L1 attrition therefore indicates that the development of susceptibility displays a curved, not a linear, function. This suggests that in native language learning there is indeed a Critical Period effect, and that full development of native language capacities necessitates exposure to L1 input for the entire duration of this CP.

====L2 attrition====

In Hansen &amp; Reetz-Kurashige (1999), Hansen cites her own research on L2-Hindi and Urdu attrition in young children. As young pre-school children in India and Pakistan, the subjects of her study were often judged to be native speakers of Hindi or Urdu; their mother was far less proficient. On return visits to their home country, the United States, both children appeared to lose all their L2 while the mother noticed no decline in her own L2 abilities. Twenty years later, those same young children as adults ''comprehend not a word from recordings of their own animated conversations in Hindi-Urdu; the mother still understands much of them''.

Yamamoto (2001) found a link between age and bilinguality. In fact, a number of factors are at play in bilingual families. In her study, bicultural families that maintained only one language, the minority language, in the household, were able to raise bilingual, bicultural children without fail. Families that adopted the one parent – one language policy were able to raise bilingual children at first but when the children joined the dominant language school system, there was a 50% chance that children would lose their minority language abilities. In families that had more than one child, the older child was most likely to retain two languages, if it was at all possible. Younger siblings in families with more than two other brothers and sisters had little chance of maintaining or ever becoming bilingual.

=== Age of arrival ===
There are few principled and systematic investigations of FLA specifically investigating the impact of AoA. However, converging evidence suggests an age effect on FLA which is much stronger and more clearly delineated than the effects that have been found in SLA research. Two studies that consider prepuberty and postpuberty migrants (Ammerlaan, 1996, AoA 0–29 yrs; Pelc, 2001, AoA 8–32 years) find that AoA is one of the most important predictors of ultimate proficiency, and a number of studies that investigate the impact of age among postpuberty migrants fail to find any effect at all (Köpke, 1999, AoA 14–36 yrs; Schmid, 2002, AoA 12–29 yrs; Schmid, 2007, AoA 17–51 yrs). A range of studies conducted by Montrul on Spanish heritage speakers in the US as well as Spanish-English bilinguals with varying levels of AoA also suggests that the L1 system of early bilinguals may be similar to that of L2 speakers, while later learners pattern with monolinguals in their L1 (e.g. Montrul, 2008; Montrul, 2009). These findings therefore indicate strongly that early (prepuberty) and late (postpuberty) exposure to an L2 environment have a different impact on possible fossilization and/or deterioration of the linguistic system.

===Frequency of use===
Frequency of use has been shown to be an important factor in language attrition.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Prosody and Language in Contact: L2 Acquisition, Attrition and Languages in Multilingual Situations|last=Yeh|first=Chia-Hsin|last2=Lin|first2=Yen-Hwei|publisher=Springer|year=2015|isbn=|location=London|pages=194|chapter=Chapter 10: Tonal Change Induced by Language Attrition and Phonetic Similarity in Hai-lu Hakka}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decline in use of a given language leads to gradual loss of that language.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite book|title=First language attrition|last=Seliger|first=Herbert L.|last2=Vago|first2=Robert M.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1991|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Understanding Interfaces: Second language acquisition and first language attrition of Spanish subject realization and word order variation|last=Domínguez|first=Laura|publisher=John Benjamins|year=2013|isbn=|location=Philadelphia|pages=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the face of much evidence to the contrary, one study is often cited to suggest that frequency of use does not correlate strongly with language attrition.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254809520_Social_Determinants_of_Language_Loss|title=Social Determinants of Language Loss|last=Jaspaert|first=Koen|last2=Kroon|first2=S.|date=January 1989|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their methodology, however, can be called into question, especially concerning the small sample size and the reliance on self reported data.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite book|title=First Language Attrition: Interdisciplinary perspectives on methodological issues|last=Köpke|first=Barbara|last2=Schmid|first2=Monika S.|publisher=John Benjamins|year=2004|isbn=|location=Philadelphia|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers themselves state that their findings may be inaccurate.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; The overall evidence suggests that frequency of use is a strong indicator of language attrition.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;

===Motivation===
Motivation could be defined as the willingness and desire to learn a second language, or, in the case of attrition, the incentive to maintain a language.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Contemporary Linguistics: An Introduction|last=Archibald|first=John|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|year=1997|isbn=|location=New York|pages=496}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motivation can be split into four categories,&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.academypublication.com/issues/past/tpls/vol01/06/12.pdf|title=The Interrelationship of Instrumental, Integrative, Intrinsic, and Extrinsic Motivations and the Lexical-oriented Knowledge among Persian EFL Language Learners|last=Soureshjani|first=Kamal Heidari|last2=Naseri|first2=Noushin|date=June 2011|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is often simply split into two distinct forms: the instrumental and the integrative.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Instrumental motivation, in the case of attrition, is the desire to maintain a language in order to complete a specific goal, i.e. maintaining a language to maintain a job. Integrative motivation, however, is motivation that comes from a desire to fit in or maintain one's cultural ties.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; These inferences can be drawn, as strategies for knowledge maintenance will, by definition, precisely oppose actions that lead to forgetting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227983368_The_Handbook_of_Applied_Linguistics|title=Language attrition|last=Schmid|first=Monika S.|last2=de Bot|first2=Kees|date=2003|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are differences in attrition related to motivation depending on the type at hand. Instrumental motivation is often less potent than integrative motivation, but, given sufficient incentives, it can be equally as powerful.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; A 1972 study by Gardner and Lambert emphasized the importance of integrative motivation in particular in regards to factors relating to language acquisition, and, by extension, language attrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187704281000889X|title=Attitude, motivation, and difficulties involved in learning the English language and factors that affect motivation in learning it|last=Al Rifai|first=Nada|date=2010|access-date=|doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2010.03.849|volume=2|journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences|pages=5216–5227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Latent learning''' is a form of [[learning]] that is not immediately expressed in an overt response; it occurs without any obvious [[reinforcement]] of the behavior or associations that are learned.&lt;ref name=Wade&gt;{{cite book|last=Wade|first=Carol Tavris, Carole|title=Psychology In Perspective|year=1997|publisher=Longman|location=New York|isbn=0-673-98314-5|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interest in latent learning arose largely because the phenomenon seemed to conflict with the widely held view that reinforcement was necessary for learning to occur.

== Early studies==
In a classic study by [[Edward C. Tolman]], three groups of rats were placed in [[Mazes#Mazes in science experiments|mazes]] and their [[behavior]] observed each day for more than two weeks. The rats in Group 1 always found food at the end of the maze; the rats in Group 2 never found food; and the rats in Group 3 found no food for 10 days, but then received food on the eleventh. The Group 1 rats quickly learned to rush to the end of the maze; Group 2 rats wandered in the maze but did not preferentially go to the end. Group 3 acted the same as the Group 2 rats until food was introduced on Day 11; then they quickly learned to run to the end of the maze and did as well as the Group 1 rats by the next day.  This showed that the Group 3 rats had learned about the organisation of the maze, but without the reinforcement of food.  Until this study, it was largely believed that reinforcement was necessary for animals to learn such tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tolman|first=E.C.|author2=C.H. Honzik |title="Insight" in Rats|journal=University of California Publications in Psychology|year=1930}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other experiments showed that latent learning can happen in shorter durations of time, e.g. 3–7 days.&lt;ref name=Reynolds&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reynolds|first=B.|title=A repetition of the Blodgett experiment on 'latent learning.'|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology|date=1 January 1945|volume=35|issue=6|pages=504–516|doi=10.1037/h0060742}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among other early studies, it was also found that animals allowed to explore the maze and then detained for one minute in the empty goal box learned the maze much more rapidly than groups not given such goal orientation.&lt;ref name=Karn&gt;{{cite journal|last=Karn|first=H. W.|author2=Porter, J. M., Jr.|title=The effects of certain pre-training procedures upon maze performance and their significance for the concept of latent learning.|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology|date=1 January 1946|volume=36|issue=5|pages=461–469|doi=10.1037/h0061422}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=January 2018}} (so what?)

In 1949, John Seward conducted studies in which rats were placed in a [[T-maze]] with one arm coloured white and the other black. One group of rats had 30 mins to explore this maze with no food present, and the rats were not removed as soon as they had reached the end of an arm. Seward then placed food in one of the two arms. Rats in this exploratory group learned to go down the rewarded arm much faster than another group of rats that had not previously explored the maze.&lt;ref name=Seward&gt;{{cite journal|last=Seward|first=John P.|title=An experimental analysis of latent learning.|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology|date=1 January 1949|volume=39|issue=2|pages=177–186|doi=10.1037/h0063169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar results were obtained by Bendig in 1952 where rats were trained to escape from water in a modified T-maze with food present while satiated for food, then tested while hungry. Upon being returned to the maze while food deprived, the rats learned where the food was located at a rate that increased with the number of pre-exposures given the rat in the training phase. This indicated varying levels of latent learning.&lt;ref name=Bendig&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bendig|first=A. W.|title=Latent learning in a water maze.|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology|date=1 January 1952|volume=43|issue=2|pages=134–137|doi=10.1037/h0059428}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most early studies of latent learning were conducted with rats, but a study by Stevenson in 1954 explored this method of learning in children.&lt;ref name=Stevenson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stevenson|first=Harold W.|title=Latent learning in children.|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology|date=1 January 1954|volume=47|issue=1|pages=17–21|doi=10.1037/h0060086}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stevenson required children to explore a series of objects to find a key, and then he determined the knowledge the children had about various non-key objects in the set-up.&lt;ref name=Stevenson/&gt; The children found non-key objects faster if they had previously seen them, indicating they were using latent learning.  Their ability to learn in this way increased as they became older.&lt;ref name=Stevenson/&gt;

In 1982, Wirsig and co-researchers used the taste of [[sodium chloride]] to explore which parts of the brain are necessary for latent learning in rats. Decorticate rats were just as able as normal rats to accomplish the latent learning task.&lt;ref name=Wirsig&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wirsig|first=Celeste R.|author2=Grill, Harvey J. |title=Contribution of the rat's neocortex to ingestive control: I.

=== In humans ===
An experiment with infants explored latent learning at an early age. Three-month-olds were exposed to two different [[hand puppets]] simultaneously.  The infants were then periodically presented with one of the puppets until they reached 6-months of age, at which point a target behavior was demonstrated on the first puppet. Finally, the infants were presented with the alternative puppet and performed the target behavior on that puppet at a higher rate than the [[Treatment and control groups|control group]] which had not seen the two puppets paired.  This suggests that the pre-exposed infants had formed an association between the puppets without obvious reinforcement.&lt;ref name=Campanella&gt;{{cite journal|last=Campanella|first=Jennifer|author2=Rovee-Collier, Carolyn |title=Latent learning and deferred imitation at 3 months|journal=Infancy|date=1 May 2005|volume=7|issue=3|pages=243–262|doi=10.1207/s15327078in0793_2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another experiment suggested that not all potential associations are easily formed by latent learning.  Human participants undeprived of [[caffeine]] were given a novel caffeinated drink for four days and then were given the drink on a caffeine-deprived fifth day. These participants did not show an increased liking for the flavor upon being caffeine-deprived, while subjects who underwent the same procedure while deprived of caffeine every day showed an increased liking for the flavor each day. In this case, flavor quality as a function of caffeine did not seem to be acquired through latent learning.&lt;ref name=Yeomans&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yeomans|first=Martin |author2=Ripley, Tamzin |author3=Lee, Michelle |author4=Durlach, Paula|title=No evidence for latent learning of liking for flavours conditioned by caffeine|journal=Psychopharmacology|year=2001|volume=157|issue=2|pages=172–179|doi=10.1007/s002130100765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Neurophysiology ===
There have been several investigations of the neural processes involved in latent learning. In one study, patients with medial temporal [[amnesia]] had particular difficulty with a latent learning task which required representational processing.&lt;ref name=Myers&gt;{{cite journal|last=Myers|first=Catherine E.|others=McGlinchey-Berroth, Regina, Warren, Stacey, Monti, Laura, Brawn, Catherine M., Gluck, Mark A.|title=Latent learning in medial temporal amnesia: Evidence for disrupted representational but preserved attentional processes.|journal=Neuropsychology|date=1 January 2000|volume=14|issue=1|pages=3–15|doi=10.1037/0894-4105.14.1.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another study, conducted with mice, found intriguing evidence that the absence of a [[PRNP|prion protein]] disrupts latent learning and other memory functions in the water maze latent learning task,&lt;ref name=Nishida&gt;{{cite journal |title=Prion Protein Is Necessary for Latent Learning and Long-Term Memory Retention |last=Nishida|first=Noriyuki |author2=Katamine, Shigeru |author3=Shigematsu, Kazuto |author4=Nakatani, Akira |author5=Sakamoto, Nobuhiro |author6=Hasegawa, Sumitaka |author7=Nakaoke, Ryota |author8=Atarashi, Ryuichiro |author9=Kataoka, Yasufumi |author10=Miyamoto, Tsutomu|journal=Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology|date=1 January 1997|volume=17|issue=5|pages=537–545|doi=10.1023/A:1026315006619}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[phencyclidine]] was found to impair latent learning in a water finding task.&lt;ref name=Noda&gt;{{cite journal|last=Noda|first=A|title=Phencyclidine impairs latent learning in mice interaction between glutamatergic systems and sigma1 receptors|journal=Neuropsychopharmacology| volume=24|issue=4|pages=451–460|doi=10.1016/S0893-133X(00)00192-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lecturer''' is an [[List of academic ranks|academic rank]] within many universities, though the meaning of the term varies somewhat from country to country. It generally denotes an academic expert who is hired to teach on a full- or part-time basis. They may also conduct research.

==United Kingdom==
{{further|Academic ranks in the United Kingdom}}

In the UK, the term lecturer is ambiguous and covers several academic ranks. The key distinction is between permanent/open-ended or temporary/fixed-term lectureships.

A permanent lecturer in UK universities usually holds an open-ended position that covers teaching, research, and administrative responsibilities. Permanent lectureships are tenure-track or tenured positions that are equivalent to an assistant or associate professorship in North America. After a number of years, a lecturer may be promoted based on his or her research record to become a [[senior lecturer]]. This position is below [[Reader (academic rank)|reader]] and [[professor]].

Research lecturers (where they are permanent appointments) are the equivalent in rank of lecturers and senior lecturers, but reflect a research-intensive orientation. Research lecturers are common in fields such as medicine, engineering, and biological and physical sciences.

In contrast, fixed-term or temporary lecturers are appointed for specific short-term teaching needs. These positions are often non-renewable and are common post-doctoral appointments. In North American terms, a fixed-term lecturer can hold an equivalent rank to assistant professor without tenure. Typically, longer contracts denote greater seniority or higher rank. Teaching fellows may also sometimes be referred to as lecturers—for example, [[Exeter]] named some of that group as education and scholarship lecturers (E &amp; S) to recognise the contribution of teaching, and elevate the titles of teaching fellows to lecturers. Some universities also refer to graduate students or others, who undertake ad-hoc teaching for a department [[sessional lecturer]]s. Like adjunct professors and sessional lecturers in North America, these non-permanent teaching staff are often very poorly paid (as little as £6000 p.a. in 2011-12).  These varying uses of the term lecturer cause confusion for non-UK academics.

As a proportion of UK academic staff, the proportion of permanent lectureships has fallen considerably. This is one reason why permanent lectureships are usually secured only after several years of post-doctoral experience. Data from the Higher Education Statistics Agency show that in 2013-14, 36 per cent of full- and part-time academic staff were on fixed-term contracts, down from 45 per cent a decade earlier. Over the same period, the proportion of academic staff on permanent contracts rose from 55 per cent to 64 per cent. Others were on contracts classed as “atypical”.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Else|first1=Holly|title=Zero Points: the persistence of temporary measures|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/content/few-crumbs-of-comfort-in-a-temporary-lecturers-day|accessdate=22 January 2016|publisher=Times Higher Education|date=4 June 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201032540/https://www.timeshighereducation.com/content/few-crumbs-of-comfort-in-a-temporary-lecturers-day|archivedate=1 February 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical use===
Historically in the UK, promotion to a senior lectureship reflected prowess in teaching or administration rather than research, and the position was much less likely to lead direct to promotion to professor.&lt;ref&gt;University of London, Academic Promotion to Senior Lecturer, Reader, and Professor, Accessed 5 June 2011, [http://www.london.ac.uk/4293.html#c7160]&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, promotion to senior lecturer nowadays is based on research achievements (for research-intensive universities), and is an integral part of the promotion path to a full chair. Promotion to reader is sometimes still necessary before promotion to a full chair; however, some universities no longer make appointments at the level of reader (for instance, the University of Leeds and the University of Oxford). Senior lecturers and readers are sometimes paid on the same salary scale, although readers are recognized as more senior. Readers in pre-1992 universities are generally considered at least the equivalent, in terms of status, of (full) professors in post-1992 universities.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Many academics consider it more prestigious to have been a reader in a pre-1992 university than a professor in a post-1992 university.{{who|date=November 2017}}

Many open-ended lecturers in the UK have a [[doctorate]] (50.1% in 2009-2010) and often have [[Postdoctoral researcher|postdoctoral research]] experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/the-rise-and-rise-of-phds-as-standard/415203.article |title=The rise and rise of PhDs as standard|work=Times Higher Education | publisher=www.timeshighereducation.co.uk |accessdate=2011-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In almost all fields, a doctorate is a prerequisite, although historically this was not the case. Some academic positions could have been held on the basis of research merit alone, without a higher degree.&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[David Fowler (mathematician)|David Fowler]] retired as a Senior Lecturer in Mathematics at Warwick in 1990 without having obtained a doctorate. See [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/david-fowler-549972.html "Obituary: David Fowler"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314083904/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/david-fowler-549972.html |date=14 March 2011 }}, ''The Independent''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current uses===
The [[new universities (United Kingdom)|new universities]] (that is universities that were until 1992 termed [[Institute of technology|polytechnics]]) have a slightly different ranking naming scheme from the older universities. Many pre-1992 universities use the grades: Lecturer (A), Lecturer (B), Senior Lecturer, Reader, Professor. Meanwhile, post-1992 grades are normally: Lecturer, Senior Lecturer, Principal Lecturer (management-focused) or Reader (research-focused), Professor. Much confusion surrounds the differing use of the "Senior Lecturer" title. A Senior Lecturer in a post-1992 university is equivalent to a Lecturer (B) in a pre-1992 university, whereas a Senior Lecturer in a pre-1992 university is most often equivalent to a Principal Lecturer in a post-1992 university.&lt;ref name=Webb&gt;Graham Webb, ''Making the Most of Appraisal: Career and Professional Development Planning for Lecturers,'' Routledge, 1994, p. 30, {{ISBN|0-7494-1256-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Times Higher Education, the [[University of Warwick]] decided in 2006 "to break away from hundreds of years of academic tradition, renaming lecturers 'assistant professors', senior lecturers and readers 'associate professors' while still calling professors 'professors'. The radical move will horrify those who believe the "professor" title should be reserved for an academic elite."&lt;ref&gt;Lee Elliot Major, "[https://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/get-the-drinks-its-professor-all-round/202229.article Get the drinks. It's professor all round]", ''Times Higher Education'', 31 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Nottingham has a mixture of the standard UK system, and the system at Warwick, with both lecturers and assistant professors. At Reading, job advertisements and academic staff web pages use the title associate professor, but the ordinances of the university make no reference to these titles. They address only procedures for conferring the traditional UK academic ranks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.reading.ac.uk/web/FILES/Calendar/New_Section_F_2010.pdf | title=Section XI Election and Appointment to Professorships or Readerships or Senior Lecturerships | work=Ordinances of the University of Reading (2010-11) | accessdate=18 December 2011 | pages=23–25 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416221602/http://www.reading.ac.uk/web/FILES/Calendar/New_Section_F_2010.pdf | archivedate=16 April 2014 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tenure and permanent lectureships{{anchor|Tenure}}===
Since the Conservatives' 1988 Education Reform Act, the ironclad tenure that used to exist in the UK has given way to a less secure form of tenure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/memories-of-jobs-for-life/104896.article?storyCode=104896&amp;sectioncode=26|title = Memories of jobs for life|work = Times Higher Education (THE)|last = Court|first = Stephen|date = 5 December 1997|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160201042445/https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/memories-of-jobs-for-life/104896.article?storyCode=104896&amp;sectioncode=26|archivedate = 1 February 2016|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technically, university vice-chancellors can make individual faculty members redundant for poor performance or institute departmental redundancies, but in practice, this is rare. The most noted use of this policy happened in 2012 at [[Queen Mary University of London]] where lecturers on permanent contracts were fired. The institutions now has a stated policy of firing and replacing under-performing ''teaching'' staff members. This policy is complicated by the 2008 ''[[Ball v Aberdeen]]'' tribunal decision, the distinction between teaching and research faculty is blurring- with implications for who can and cannot be made redundant at UK universities, and under what conditions.

Despite this recent erosion of tenure in the UK, it is still practiced in most universities. Permanent contracts use the word "tenure" for lecturers who are "reappointed to the retiring age". This is equivalent to a US tenure decision—references are sought from world-leading academics and tenure and promotions committees meet to decide "tenure" cases. There is normally no title elevation in such instances—tenure and title are independent.

==Comparison==
The table presents a broad overview of the traditional main systems, but there are universities which use a combination of those systems or other titles. Note that some universities in Commonwealth countries have adopted the American system in place of the Commonwealth system.

==United States==
{{further|Academic ranks in the United States}}
As different US academic institutions use the term lecturer in various ways, there is sometimes confusion. On a generic level, the term broadly denotes ''one who teaches at a university but is not eligible for tenure and has no research obligations''. At non-research colleges, the latter distinction is less meaningful, making the absence of tenure the main difference between lecturers and other academic faculty. Unlike the adjective adjunct (which can modify most academic titles, from professor to lecturer to instructor, etc. and refers to part-time status), the title of lecturer at most schools does ''not'' address the issue of full-time vs. part-time status.

Lecturers are almost always required to have at least a master's degree and quite often have earned doctorates. (For example, at [[Columbia University]] in New York, the title of lecturer actually requires a doctorate or its professional equivalent; they also use the term for "instructors in specialized programs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/vpaa/handbook/instruction.html|title=Officers of Instruction|author=|date=|website=www.columbia.edu|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;)  Sometimes the title is used as an equivalent-alternative to [[Teacher|instructor]], but schools that use both titles tend to provide relatively more advancement potential (e.g. multiple ranks of progression, at least some of which entail faculty voting privileges or faculty committee service) to their lecturers.&lt;ref name="lsa.umich.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lsa.umich.edu/UMICH/pite/static%20files/lec34.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313194335/http://www.lsa.umich.edu/UMICH/pite/static%20files/lec34.pdf |archivedate=13 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major research universities are more frequently hiring full-time lecturers, whose responsibilities tend to focus primarily in undergraduate education, especially for introductory/survey courses. In addition to the reason of higher-ranking faculty tending to prefer higher-level courses, part of the reason is also cost-savings, as non-tenure-track faculty tend to have lower salaries.&lt;ref&gt;http://hr.umich.edu/hrris/reports/docs/FSA_2011-2012.pdf{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; When a lecturer is part-time, there is little practical distinction in the position from an [[adjunct professor]]/instructor/etc., since all non-tenure-track faculty by definition are not on the tenure-track. However, for full-time lecturers (or those regularly salaried above some stated level, such as half-time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regents.umich.edu/bylaws/bylaws05a.html|title=Chapter V. The Faculties and Academic Staff - Regents of the University of Michigan|author=|date=|website=www.regents.umich.edu|accessdate=2 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180502114737/http://www.regents.umich.edu/bylaws/bylaws05a.html|archivedate=2 May 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;), many institutions now incorporate the role quite formally—managing it with performance reviews, promotional tracks, administrative service responsibilities, and many faculty privileges (e.g. voting, use of resources, etc.).&lt;ref name="lsa.umich.edu"/&gt;

An emerging alternative to using full-time lecturers at research institutions is to create a parallel professorship track that is focused on teaching. It may offer tenure, and typically has a title series such as teaching professor. (This is analogous to the ''research-only'' faculty tracks at some universities, which typically have title series such as research professor/scientist/scholar.)  A related concept—at least in professional fields—is the [[clinical professor]] or professor of practice, which in addition to a teaching focus (vs. research), also tend to have a practical/professional/skills oriented focus (vs. theory and scholarship, etc.).

In some institutions, the position of lecturer, especially "distinguished lecturer", may also refer to a position somewhat similar to ''emeritus professor'' or a temporary post used for visiting academics of considerable prominence—e.g. a famous writer may serve for a term or a year, for instance. When confusion arose about President [[Barack Obama]]'s status on the law faculty at the [[University of Chicago]], the institution stated that although his title was "senior lecturer", the university considered him to be a "professor" and further noted that it uses that title for notable people, such as federal judges and politicians, who are deemed of high prestige but lack the time to commit to a traditional tenure-track position.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.factcheck.org/askfactcheck/was_barack_obama_really_a_constitutional_law.html "Was Barack Obama really a constitutional law lecturer?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617230454/http://www.factcheck.org/askfactcheck/was_barack_obama_really_a_constitutional_law.html |date=17 June 2008 }}, Fact Check&lt;/ref&gt;  While other universities instead use the term "senior" as simply a matter of rank or promotion, all such references to lecturers of any rank are consistent with the normal U.S. practice of using ''lower-case-p'' "professor" as a common noun for anyone who teaches college, as well as a ''pre-nominal'' title of address (e.g. "Professor Smith") without necessarily referring to ''job'' title or position ''rank'' (e.g. "John Smith, Assistant/Associate/Full Professor of X").

==Australia==
{{further|Academic ranks (Australia and New Zealand)}}

In Australia, the term lecturer may be used informally to refer to anyone who conducts lectures at a university or elsewhere, but formally refers to a specific academic rank. The academic ranks in Australia are similar to those in the UK, with the rank of associate professor roughly equivalent to reader in UK universities. The academic levels in Australia are (in ascending academic level): A) associate lecturer, (B) lecturer, (C) senior lecturer, (D) associate professor, and (E) professor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eui.eu/ProgrammesAndFellowships/AcademicCareersObservatory/AcademicCareersbyCountry/Australia.aspx|title=Australia, Academic Career Structure|author=|date=|website=eui.eu|accessdate=2 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170628005947/http://www.eui.eu/ProgrammesAndFellowships/AcademicCareersObservatory/AcademicCareersbyCountry/Australia.aspx|archivedate=28 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==India==
{{further|Academic ranks in India}}

In India, one can appear for interviews for a post of a lecturer after passing the competitive exam of [[National Eligibility Test]] conducted by the [[University Grants Commission (India)|University Grants Commission]].

The position is equivalent to assistant professor in the US system. The term is not universally applied, with some universities preferring the lecturer/reader /professor titles, while others work with the assistant professor/associate professor/professor title.

As such, most lecturers' position can be considered tenure track.

In many states of India, the term lecturer or Post Graduate Teacher (PGT)&lt;ref name="kvs"&gt;{{cite web|title=KENDRIYA VIDYALAYA SANGATHAN|url=http://kvsangathan.nic.in/FAQ/recruitmentrulesfooter.htm|website=kvsangathan.nic.in|accessdate=27 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509234607/http://kvsangathan.nic.in/FAQ/recruitmentrulesfooter.htm|archivedate=9 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; is also used for the intermediate college teachers.&lt;ref name="lect"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Alam |first1=Shah Manzoor |title=Urban Growth Theories and Settlement Systems of India|date=2011|publisher=Concept Publishing Company |isbn=9788180697395|page=xii|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2E-XejrqHt0C&amp;pg=PR12&amp;dq=lecturer+intermediate+college#v=onepage&amp;q=lecturer%20intermediate%20college&amp;f=false |accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intermediate colleges or Junior Colleges are equivalent to [[Higher Secondary Examination|higher secondary]] schools.

==Other countries==
{{further|List of academic ranks}}

In other countries, usage varies. In [[Israel]], the term has a meaning in academia similar to that in the UK.

In [[France]], the title ''maître de conférences'' ("lecture master") is a permanent position that covers research and teaching (and usually administrative responsibilities). It is the lower of the two permanent faculty ranks (the other being ''professeur des universités'' or "university professor").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006064492|title=Décret n°84-431 du 6 juin 1984 fixant les dispositions statutaires communes applicables aux enseignants-chercheurs et portant statut particulier du corps des professeurs des universités et du corps des maîtres de conférences|last=|first=|date=|website=legifrance.gouv.fr|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title of ''lecteur'' is used for teachers of foreign languages with no research responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=|first=|title=Décret n°87-754 du 14 septembre 1987 relatif au recrutement de lecteurs de langue étrangère et de maîtres de langue étrangère dans les établissements publics d'enseignement supérieur relevant du ministre chargé de l'enseignement supérieur|date=September 14, 1987|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000867627|volume=|pages=|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In German-speaking countries, the term ''lektor'' historically denoted a teaching position below a professor, primarily responsible for delivering and organizing lectures. The contemporary equivalent is ''dozent'' or . Nowadays, the German term ''lektor'' exists only in philology or modern-language departments at German-speaking universities for positions that primarily involve teaching a foreign language.  The equivalent rank within the German university system is something like ''Juniorprofessor'', ''Dozent'', ''Hochschuldozent'', ''Juniordozent'', ''Akademischer Rat'' or ''-Oberrat'',  ''Lehrkraft für besondere Aufgaben'', and the like.

In [[Poland]], the related term ''lektor'' is used for a teaching-only position, generally for teaching foreign languages.

In [[Norway]], a ''lektor'', University Lektor and University College Lektor are academic ranks at universities and university colleges in Norway. The requirements for such position is a combination of relevant degree on master level (five years master or bachelor plus two years master) or higher, research experience, teaching experience and pedagogic education and training. The rank is similar to Lecturer in Great Britain.
The Rank is also an academic rank which enables a teacher to lecture at [[Ungdomsskole]] (secondary school) on specialized fields and [[Videregående skole]] (high school) level. All teacher students in Norway are now required to reach a master's degree in order to be able to teach at all levels up to universities and university colleges. 
 
In [[Sweden]] and [[Denmark]], a ''lektor'' or ''universitetslektor'' is an academic rank similar to that of senior lecturer in Great Britain and associate professor in USA. The ''lektor'' holds the position below professor in rank.

In [[Singapore]], a Lecturer at the [[National University of Singapore]] is a full-time and renewable position that include both the opportunities for research funding and for promotion to Associate Professor on the [[Educator Track]]. It is equivalent to [[Teaching Assistant Professor]] at a US university.

In [[South Korea]], the term ''gangsa'' is the literal translation of "part-time lecturer". A gangsa is usually part-time, paid by the number of hours of teaching. No research or administrative obligation is attached. In most disciplines, gangsa is regarded as a first step in one's academic career. In Korea, the tenure position started from "full-time lecturer". The tenure track positions in South Korea are "full-time lecturer (JunImGangSa)", "assistant professor (JoKyoSu)", "associate professor (BuKyosu)", and "professor (KyoSu)". Therefore, "full-time lecturer" is the same position as "assistant professor" in other countries, including the USA.

In the Netherlands, a "lector" used to be equivalent to the rank of associate professor at universities. Nowadays, it is the highest rank at so-called "applied universities" (i.e., school providing higher vocational/professional training to their students). At regular universities, this rank does not exist anymore.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="918">The term '''''oracy''''' was coined by Andrew Wilkinson, a British researcher and educator, in the 1960s. This word is formed by analogy from [[literacy]] and [[numeracy]]. The purpose is to draw attention to the neglect of [[Speech communication|oral skills]] in [[education]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25132">The '''overjustification effect''' occurs when an expected external [[wikt:incentive|incentive]] such as money or prizes decreases a person's [[Motivation#Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation|intrinsic motivation]] to perform a task. Overjustification is an explanation for the phenomenon known as [[Motivation crowding theory|motivational "crowding out."]] The overall effect of offering a reward for a previously unrewarded activity is a shift to extrinsic motivation and the undermining of pre-existing intrinsic motivation. Once rewards are no longer offered, interest in the activity is lost; prior intrinsic motivation does not return, and extrinsic rewards must be continuously offered as motivation to sustain the activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Carlson, R.Neil  |author2=Heth, C. Donald |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2007|title=Psychology the Science of Behaviour|publisher=Pearson Education:New Jersey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experimental evidence==
The overjustification effect has been widely demonstrated in many settings. In one of the earliest demonstrations of this effect, [[Edward Deci]] and his colleagues conducted a laboratory experiment in 1971 where subjects showing [[wikt:baseline|baseline]] interest in solving a puzzle were exposed to two different conditions. The [[control group]] were not paid on all three days while the [[experimental group]] were not paid on the first day, were paid on the second day and were not paid again on the third day. The subjects were given a break in the middle of each session and were being observed while doing whatever they wanted. The results showed that the experimental group spent significantly more time than the control group playing the puzzle during their break time on day 2 when they were paid but significantly less on day 3 when they were not paid. This was interpreted as evidence that the extrinsic monetary [[Bounty (reward)|reward]] significantly reduced their [[intrinsic motivation]] to engage in the task.&lt;ref name="Lepper 1973 129–137"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lepper|first=M.P|author2=Greene, D. |author3=Nisbett, R. E |title=Undermining children's Intrinsic interest with extrinsic reward: A test of the "overjustification" hypothesis|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1973|volume=28|issue=1|pages=129–137|url=http://web.mit.edu/curhan/www/docs/Articles/15341_Readings/Motivation/Lepper_et_al_Undermining_Childrens_Intrinsic_Interest.pdf|doi=10.1037/h0035519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers at [[Southern Methodist University]] conducted an experiment on 188 female university students in which they measured the subjects' continued interest in a cognitive task (a word game) after their initial performance under different incentives. The subjects were divided into two groups. Members of the first group were told that they would be rewarded for competence. Above-average players would be paid more and below-average players would be paid less. Members of the second group were told that they would be rewarded only for completion. Their pay was scaled by the number of repetitions or the number of hours playing. Afterwards, half of the subjects in each group were told that they over-performed, and the other half were told that they under-performed, regardless of how well each subject actually did. Members of the first group generally showed greater interest in the game and continued playing for a longer time than the members of the second group. "Over-performers" continued playing longer than "under-performers" in the first group, but "under-performers" continued playing longer than "over-performers" in the second group. This study showed that, when rewards do not reflect competence, higher rewards lead to less intrinsic motivation. But when rewards do reflect competence, higher rewards lead to greater intrinsic motivation.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rosenfield |first=D. |last2=Folger |first2=R. |last3=Adelman |first3=H. F. |year=1980 |title=When rewards reflect competence: A qualification of the overjustification effect |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=368–376 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.39.3.368 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Titmuss]] suggested that paying for [[blood donations]] might reduce the supply of blood donors. To test this, a [[field experiment]] with three treatments was conducted. In the first treatment, the donors did not receive compensation. In the second treatment, the donors received a small payment. In the third treatment, donors were given a choice between the payment and an equivalent-valued contribution to [[Charitable organization|charity]]. None of the three treatments affected the number of male donors, but the second treatment almost halved the number of female donors. However, allowing the contribution to charity fully eliminated this effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mellstrom|first=Carl|author2=Magnus Johannesson|title=Crowding out in blood donation: Was Titmuss right?|journal=Journal of the European Economic Association|year=2008|volume=6|issue=4|pages=845–863|doi=10.1162/JEEA.2008.6.4.845}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==
According to [[self-perception theory]], a person infers causes about his or her own behavior based on external constraints. The presence of a strong constraint (such as a reward) would lead a person to conclude that he or she is performing the behavior solely for the reward, which shifts the person's motivation from intrinsic to extrinsic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aronson |first=E. |last2=Akert |first2=R. D. |last3=Wilson |first3=T. D. |year=2006 |title=Social psychology |edition=6th |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laboratory studies in the 1970s indicated that individuals under conditions with extrinsic rewards showed diminished intrinsic motivation. Deci and his colleagues (e.g., Deci and Ryan 1985) developed the [[cognitive evaluation theory]] to explain the results. As a sub-theory of [[self-determination theory]], cognitive evaluation theory explains that both control and competence underlie intrinsic motivation and how extrinsic rewards affect intrinsic motivation is dependent on the individual's interpretation. Intrinsic motivation increases if individuals interpret rewards as pertaining positive information about their own competence and self-control over results, whereas if they interpret the results as indicative of external control, this decreases their feelings of self-control and competence, which in turn decreases intrinsic motivation. Cognitive evaluation theory also suggests social context as another implication on intrinsic motivation. Social cues can exert either positive or negative effects on intrinsic motivation depending on the messages that the context conveys regarding a person's autonomy and competence. Verbal rewards such as positive feedback and praise are predicted to be experienced as controlling hence decreasing intrinsic motivation. However, verbal rewards that are informational and not experienced as controlling are predicted to exert positive effects.&lt;ref name="Deci 1999 627–668"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deci|first=E.L.|author2=Koestner, R. Ryan, R.M.|title=A Meta-Analytic Review of Experiments Examining the Effects of Extrinsic Rewards on Intrinsic Motivation|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=1999|volume=125|pages=627–668|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.125.6.627}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-determination theory is a broad theory of motivation in work organizations that maintains the predictions of cognitive evaluation theory but also recognizes the limitations of the theory, such as organizational conditions under which predictions do not apply or are less relevant in real-world settings, which cognitive evaluation theory fails to recognize. The theory differentiates between various types of motivational states, distinguishes the organizational conditions where extrinsic rewards are more effective than intrinsic rewards, examines individual differences in orientation toward intrinsic versus extrinsic motivation and discusses managerial behavior that can enhance intrinsic motivation. Findings from the Deci et al. (1989) study have supported self-determination theory as an approach to work motivation by showing how managers can impact the work attitudes of their employees. The study reported that managerial autonomy support which included provision of options, giving relevant information in a non-autonomous way, acknowledging subordinates' perspectives and cultivating self-initiation resulted in employees having more positive work-related attitudes such as higher level of job satisfaction and increased level of trust in corporate management.&lt;ref name="Gagne 2005 331–362"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gagne|first=M.|author2=Deci E.L.|title=Self-Determination Theory and Work Motivation|journal=Journal of Organizational Behavior|year=2005|volume=26|pages=331–362|doi=10.1002/job.322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
[[File:Overjustification Effect Rewards and Motivation.jpg|thumb|upright|Directional effects of rewards on motivation, depending on type of task, type of reward, and contingency of reward.]] The overjustification effect is controversial because it challenges previous findings in psychology on the general effectiveness of [[reinforcement]] on increasing behavior, and also the widespread practice of using incentives in the classroom. These findings fail to account for situations whereby the nature of activities differ, such as in cases where the initial level of intrinsic interest in the activity is very low, introducing extrinsic contingencies may be essential for producing involvement.&lt;ref name="Lepper 1973 129–137"/&gt; These conclusions were challenged in a separate meta-analysis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cameron|first=Judy|author2=W. David Pierce|title=Reinforcement, reward, and intrinsic motivation: A meta-analysis|journal=Review of Educational Research|date=Fall 1994|volume=64|issue=3|pages=363–423|doi=10.3102/00346543064003363}}&lt;/ref&gt; which found that [[tangible]] rewards offered for outperforming others and for performing uninteresting tasks (in which intrinsic motivation is low) lead to increased intrinsic motivation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cameron |first=J. |year=2001 |title=Negative effects of reward on intrinsic motivation- A limited phenomenon: Comment on Deci, Koestner, and Ryan |journal=Review of Educational Research |volume=71 |issue=1 |pages=29–42 |doi=10.3102/00346543071001029 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and stated that the detrimental effects of rewards on motivation only occur in a specific, restricted set of conditions that could be easily avoided.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Eisenberger|first = Robert|author2 = Cameron|title = Detrimental effects of reward: Reality or myth?|journal = American Psychologist|date = November 1996|volume = 51|issue = 11|pages = 1153–1166|doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.51.11.1153|first2 = Judy}}&lt;/ref&gt; This set of analyses included both high-interest and low-interest tasks, whereas the original meta-analyses conducted by Deci and colleagues (1999) restricted analyses to tasks in which participants initially had high interest. In fact, a 2001 [[meta-analysis]] showed that rewards can increase intrinsic motivation for tasks that initially hold little intrinsic interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cameron|first=Judy|author2=Katherine M. Banko |author3=W. David Pierce |title=Pervasive negative effects of rewards on intrinsic motivation: The myth continues|journal=The Behavior Analyst|date=Spring 2001|volume=24|issue=1|pages=1–44|url=http://www.behavior.org/resources/331.pdf|accessdate=28 March 2012|pmc=2731358|pmid=22478353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, according to Eisenberger and Cameron, claimed negative effects of extrinsic rewards on task interest derived from the Deci study (1971) do not take into consideration that conditions manufactured in laboratory settings that produce these effects are not true reflections of situations in the real world. For example, in the Deci study the incentive was provided for one session and was then arbitrarily withdrawn in the next and such incentive plans do not exist in the real world. Also, the reduced intrinsic interest seen in subjects may be explained by a negative reaction when the reward was withheld.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Eisenberger and his colleges also claimed that the [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of the dependent measure is highly questionable in the Deci study. Laboratory results that used the amount of free time spend on the task as the dependent measure are shown to be far weaker than when self reports are used for these measures. The Deci study gives far less weight to self reports, however self-reports about subjects' level of internal motivation seem to be a more direct measure of the psychological state of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eisenberger|first=R|author2=Pierce, W.D. Cameron, J.|title=Effects of Reward on Intrinsic Motivation- Negative, Neutral and Positive: Comment on Deci, Koestner, and Ryan|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=1999|volume=125|pages=677–691|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.125.6.677}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Considerable research has also shown that rewards tend to enhance feelings of competence and autonomy and high standards, pressure and competitiveness are able to increase these effects. For example, employees view earning [[incentives]] as enjoyable rather than a dreaded tool of management control. These findings are in contrast with the psychological mechanism for effects that Deci and his colleges had claimed in the past. Also in the past 30 years, notable academic reviews of rewards have confirmed that monetary incentives have shown to significantly increase performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gerhart|first=B.|author2=Rynes, S.L. Fulmer, I.S.|title=Pay and Performance: Individuals, Groups, and Executives|journal=The Academy of Management Annals|year=2009|volume=3|issue=1|pages=207–271|doi=10.1080/19416520903047269}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Additionally, some activities require a significant level of mastery or engagement before its attractiveness becomes apparent to an individual, in such cases external incentives may be useful to build individuals up to that level. [[Token economy]] programs represent one example in which there is evidence showing that such programs have successfully implemented extrinsic rewards to increase interest in certain broad classes of activities.&lt;ref name="Lepper 1973 129–137"/&gt;

There are also differences in effect among the different age groups. According to Deci et al. (1999), the negative effects extrinsic contingencies have on intrinsic motivation seem to be more severe for children than college students. One possible explanation is that college students have greater cognitive capacity, enabling them to better separate informational and controlling aspects of rewards. Hence they are able to interpret rewards as indicators of effective performance rather than controlling their behavior, which causes them to operate with performance-goal orientations. It is therefore speculated that such differences are far greater between children and employed workers.&lt;ref name="Deci 1999 627–668"/&gt;

A rebuttal defended the original findings, concluding that this analysis by Cameron (2001) was flawed and that Cameron's inclusion of boring tasks in analyzing potential overjustification effects made little theoretical or practical sense. This rebuttal argued that cognitive evaluation theory is the most consistent structure for explaining the effects of rewards on intrinsic motivation, pointing to several other papers that have supported the theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Deci |first=E. |last2=Koestner |first2=R. |last3=Ryan |first3=R. |year=2001 |title=The pervasive negative effects of rewards on intrinsic motivation: Response to Cameron (2001) |journal=Review of Educational Research |volume=71 |issue=1 |pages=43–51 |doi=10.3102/00346543071001043 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Education===
Findings from the Lepper et al.'s (1973) study suggest that presenting these extrinsic rewards poses central problems in the schooling system in that it fails to preserve the intrinsic interest in learning and exploration that a child may seem to possess during his initial phase in school. This also has severe ramifications on the education system, as it seems to almost undermine children's spontaneous interest in the process of learning itself, instead their motivation is driven by these extrinsic rewards. Research in this area suggests that parents and educators should rely on intrinsic motivation and preserve feelings of autonomy and competence as much as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Deci |first=E. L. |year=1995 |title=Why we do what we do: The dynamics of personal autonomy |location=New York |publisher=G.P. Putnam's Sons |isbn=0-399-14047-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the task is unattractive and intrinsic motivation is insufficient (e.g., household chores), then extrinsic rewards are useful to provide incentives for behavior.

School programs that provide money or prizes for reading books have been criticized for their potential to reduce intrinsic motivation by overjustification. However, a study of the [[Pizza Hut]] program, [[Book It!]], found that participation in the program neither increased nor decreased reading motivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Flora |first=S. R. |last2=Flora |first2=D. B. |year=1999 |title=Effects of extrinsic reinforcement for reading during childhood on reported reading habits of college students |journal=Psychological Record |volume=49 |issue=1 |pages=3–14 |doi= |url=http://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1446&amp;context=tpr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although motivating students to read by rewarding them may undermine their interest in reading, it may also encourage the reading skills necessary for developing an interest in reading.

===Workplace===
Cognitive evaluation theory further predicts the different types of rewards that will exert different effects. According to the theory, task non-contingent rewards like benefits that are based on things other than performance, such as employment that do not consist any information regarding autonomy and competence, will have no effect on intrinsic motivation. Task contingent rewards on the other hand like [[salary]] which are awarded for performing or completing a task, will be experienced as controlling and hence will have a negative effect on intrinsic motivation. The study conducted by Deckop and Cirka (2000) reported that introducing merit pay programs in a [[non-profit organization]] led to decreased feelings of autonomy and intrinsic motivation, indicating that rewards can undermine intrinsic motivation in work settings.&lt;ref name="Gagne 2005 331–362"/&gt;

Performance contingent rewards like monetary incentives that are given for good performance or meeting a certain standard will be experienced as highly controlling hence decreasing intrinsic motivation. The Shirom, Westman, and Melamed (1999) study found that [[pay for performance (human resources)|pay-for-performance]] plans resulted in lower well being in [[blue-collar workers]], and this was especially evident for those who felt that their jobs were monotonous.&lt;ref name="Gagne 2005 331–362"/&gt; However, in certain cases where the reward also conveys information about competence that will in turn reduce the negative effect.&lt;ref name="Deci 1999 627–668"/&gt;

===Gamification===
The term [[gamification]] refers to the application of game design elements to non-game contexts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deterding|first=Sebastian|author2=Kenton O'Hara |author3=Miguel Sicart |author4=Dan Dixon |author5=Lennart Nacke |title=Gamification: Using game design elements in non-gaming contexts|journal=CHI|year=2011|url=http://gamification-research.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/01-Deterding-Sicart-Nacke-OHara-Dixon.pdf|doi=10.1145/1979742.1979575|}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to drive participation, often with the goal of encouraging greater engagement with the non-game context by providing symbolic rewards such as points, badges, or [[virtual economy|virtual currency]]. However, a number of academics and other critics have expressed concern that these rewards may backfire via the overjustification effect. Drawing directly on self-determination theory, these critics of gamification express concerns that gamified contexts such as [[foursquare]] might provide expected rewards for activities that do not adequately meet self-determination theory's three innate needs for intrinsic motivation—relatedness, autonomy, and competence—and therefore reduce intrinsic interest in those activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Groh|first=Fabian|title=Gamification: State of the art definition and utilization|journal=Proceedings of the 4th Seminar on Research Trends in Media Informatics|date=February 14, 2012|url=http://hubscher.org/roland/courses/hf765/readings/Groh_2012.pdf|pp=39–46|DOI=10.18725/OPARU-1773|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616221900/http://hubscher.org/roland/courses/hf765/readings/Groh_2012.pdf|archivedate=June 16, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crowdsourcing===
Websites that rely on [[user-generated content]] sometimes offer monetary rewards for contributions, but these may cause the contributors to succumb to the overjustification effect and stop contributing.&lt;ref name="wisdump"&gt;wisdump:{{cite web |url=http://www.wisdump.com/web/the-overjustification-effect-and-user-generated-content/|title=The Overjustification Effect and User Generated Content|accessdate=Mar 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Amazon Mechanical Turk]] allows the creator of a task to offer a monetary reward, but a survey of 431 Mechanical Turk participants showed that they are driven more by intrinsic motivations than a desire for the usually meager monetary compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaufmann|first=Nicolas|last2=Schulze|first2=Thimo|last3=Veit|first3=Daniel|title=More than fun and money: Worker Motivation in Crowdsourcing – A Study on Mechanical Turk|journal=Proceedings of the Seventeenth Americas Conference on Information Systems, Detroit, Michigan|date=August 4, 2011|url=http://schader.bwl.uni-mannheim.de/fileadmin/files/publikationen/Kaufmann_Schulze_Veit_2011_-_More_than_fun_and_money_Worker_motivation_in_Crowdsourcing_-_A_Study_on_Mechanical_Turk_AMCIS_2011.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227173340/http://schader.bwl.uni-mannheim.de/fileadmin/files/publikationen/Kaufmann_Schulze_Veit_2011_-_More_than_fun_and_money_Worker_motivation_in_Crowdsourcing_-_A_Study_on_Mechanical_Turk_AMCIS_2011.pdf|archivedate=February 27, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overjustification effect was also considered in a study on how to maximize contributions when [[crowdsourcing]] creative endeavors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Akar|first = Oguz Ali|last2 = van den Ende|first2 = Jan|title = Motivation, Reward Size and Contribution in Idea Crowdsourcing|journal = Dime-Druid Academy Winter Conference 2011|date = January 20, 2011|url = http://www.mendeley.com/research/motivation-reward-size-contribution-idea-crowdsourcing/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Volunteering===
Empirical evidence shows that expected financial rewards "crowd out" intrinsic motivation, while the size of the monetary reward simultaneously provides extrinsic motivation. If the size of the monetary reward is not large enough to compensate for the loss of intrinsic motivation, overall engagement can decline. A survey data-set revealed that small financial payments reduced [[Volunteering|volunteer]] hours among Swiss citizens, and that the median financial reward provided to these volunteers caused them to work less than volunteers who were not given any payment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frey|first=Bruno S.|author2=Lorenz Goette|title=Does pay motivate volunteers?|journal=Zurich, Switzerland: Institute for Empirical Research in Economics Working Paper Series|year=1999|url=http://e-collection.library.ethz.ch/eserv/eth:25512/eth-25512-01.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sports===
The overjustification effect has also been linked to professional sports. The performance of numerous athletes has diminished following the signing of a lucrative, multimillion-dollar contract. Some notable professional athletes whose performances have diminished following a large contract include Alex Rodriguez (MLB), Albert Pujols (MLB), Wayne Rooney (Premier League) and Albert Haynesworth (NFL).

A '''practicum''' (also called '''work placement''', especially in the [[UK]]) is a [[graduate school|graduate]] level course, often in a specialized field of study, that is designed to give students supervised practical application of a previously or concurrently studied theory. Practicums ([[student teaching]]) are common for [[education]] and [[social work]] majors.  In some cases, the practicum may be a part-time student teaching placement that occurs the semester before a student's full-time student teaching placement.

The process resembles an [[internship]]; however, the latter is often not part of the [[school]] program.

Practicum is widely practiced in Asia, especially in India. There, a B.Ed. student has to undergo rigorous training in Teaching and they have to face a lot of practicums to earn their degree. It generally makes one practically face a situation and describe their experience. It differs from Practical in terms of its handling mainly alive beings whereas Practical is confined within the inert materials.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23341">A '''professional learning community''' ('''PLC''') is a method to foster [[collaborative learning]] among colleagues within a particular work environment or field. It is often used in schools as a way to organize teachers into working groups of [[practice-based professional learning]].

==History==
The phrase ''professional learning community'' began to be used in the 1990s after [[Peter Senge]]'s book ''[[The Fifth Discipline]]'' (1990) had popularized the idea of [[learning organization]]s,&lt;ref name="Senge"&gt;{{cite book |last=Senge |first=Peter M. |authorlink=Peter Senge |date=2006 |origyear=1990 |title=The fifth discipline: the art and practice of the learning organization |edition=Revised |location=New York |publisher=Currency/Doubleday |isbn=0385517254 |oclc=65166960}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson2004"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Thompson |first1=Sue C. |last2=Gregg |first2=Larry |last3=Niska |first3=John M. |date=January 2004 |title=Professional learning communities, leadership, and student learning |journal=RMLE Online |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=1–15 |doi=10.1080/19404476.2004.11658173 |url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ807417.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}} related to the idea of [[reflective practice]] espoused by [[Donald Schön]] in books such as ''The Reflective Turn: Case Studies in and on Educational Practice'' (1991).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Schön |editor-first=Donald A. |editor-link=Donald Schön |date=1991 |title=The reflective turn: case studies in and on educational practice |location=New York |publisher=[[Teachers College Press]] |isbn=0807730467 |oclc=22110784}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lieberman |first=Ann |date=April 1995 |title=Practices that support teacher development: transforming conceptions of professional learning |journal=[[Phi Delta Kappan]] |volume=76 |issue=8 |pages=591–596}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles B. Myers and Lynn K. Myers used the phrase ''professional learning community'' in relation to schools in their 1995 book ''The Professional Educator: A New Introduction to Teaching and Schools'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Myers |first1=Charles B. |last2=Myers |first2=Lynn K. |date=1995 |title=The professional educator: a new introduction to teaching and schools |location=Belmont, CA |publisher=[[Wadsworth Publishing]] |isbn=0534205747 |oclc=31009967}} See also: {{cite book |last1=Myers |first1=Charles B. |last2=Simpson |first2=Douglas J. |date=1998 |title=Re-creating schools: places where everyone learns and likes it |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |publisher=[[Corwin Press]] |isbn=0803964250 |oclc=37353705}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a year later Charles B. Myers presented a paper at the annual meeting of the [[American Educational Research Association]] titled "Beyond the PDS: Schools as Professional Learning Communities" that proposed a path from professional development school (PDS) efforts to schools as professional learning communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Myers |first=Charles B. |date=April 1996 |title=Beyond the PDS: schools as professional learning communities: a proposal based on an analysis of PDS efforts of the 1990s |publisher=Paper presented at the annual meeting of the [[American Educational Research Association]], New York City, April 8–12, 1996 |url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED400227.pdf |accessdate=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, Shirley M.

Eaker published the book ''Professional Learning Communities at Work''.&lt;ref name="DuFourEaker"&gt;{{cite book |last1=DuFour |first1=Richard |authorlink1=Richard DuFour |last2=Eaker |first2=Robert E. |date=1998 |title=Professional learning communities at work: best practices for enhancing student achievement |location=Bloomington; Alexandria, VA |publisher=National Educational Service; [[Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development]] |isbn=1879639602 |oclc=39040733}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the late 1990s, a large literature on PLCs has been published.&lt;ref&gt;A search for the phrase on [[Google Scholar]] on 27 October 2016 returned over 17,000 results.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
PLCs have many variations. In Shirley M. Hord's 1997 definition, it means "extending classroom practice into the community; bringing community personnel into the school to enhance the curriculum and learning tasks for students; or engaging students, teachers, and administrators simultaneously in learning".&lt;ref name="Hord"/&gt;{{rp|1}} Hord noted that the benefits of professional learning community to educators and students include reduced isolation of teachers, better informed and committed teachers, and academic gains for students.&lt;ref name="Hord"/&gt; In 1998, Richard DuFour and Robert E. Eaker explained:

{{Quote|text=If schools are to be significantly more effective, they must break from the industrial model upon which they were created and embrace a new model that enables them to function as learning organizations. We prefer characterizing learning organizations as "professional learning communities" for several vital reasons. While the term "organization" suggests a partnership enhanced by efficiency, expediency, and mutual interests, "community" places greater emphasis on relationships, shared ideals, and a strong culture—all factors that are critical to school improvement. The challenge for educators is to create a community of commitment—a professional learning community. [...] It sounds simple enough, but as the old adage warns, "the devil is in the details." Educators willing to embrace the concept of the school as a professional learning community will be given ambiguous, oftentimes conflicting advice on how they should proceed. |author=[[Richard DuFour]] and Robert E. Eaker |source=''Professional Learning Communities at Work''&lt;ref name="DuFourEaker"/&gt;{{rp|15–16}} }}

In 2004, DuFour stated that initiating and sustaining a PLC "requires the school staff to focus on learning rather than teaching, work collaboratively on matters related to learning, and hold itself accountable for the kind of results that fuel continual improvement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=DuFour |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard DuFour |date=May 2004 |title=What is a 'professional learning community'? |journal=Educational Leadership |volume=61 |issue=8 |pages=6–11 |url=http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/may04/vol61/num08/What-Is-a-Professional-Learning-Community%C2%A2.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}} In 2005, the [[Ontario Ministry of Education]] defined a PLC as "a shared vision for running a school in which everyone can make a contribution, and staff are encouraged to collectively undertake activities and reflection in order to constantly improve their students' performance".&lt;ref name="EFA"&gt;{{cite book |title=Education for all: the report of the expert panel on literacy and numeracy instruction for students with special education needs, kindergarten to grade 6 |date=2005 |url=http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/document/reports/speced/panel/speced.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061003084018/http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/document/reports/speced/panel/speced.pdf |archivedate=3 October 2006 |accessdate=16 November 2006 |location=Toronto |publisher=[[Ministry of Education (Ontario)]] |isbn=0779480600 |oclc=225161136}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|53}}

[[Michael Fullan]] has noted that "in the spread of PLCs, we have found that the term travels a lot faster than the concept, a finding common to all innovations. The concept is deep and requires careful and persistent attention in thorough learning by reflective doing and problem solving."&lt;ref name="Fullan"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fullan |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Fullan |date=2016 |origyear=1982 |chapter=Enter change |title=The NEW meaning of educational change |edition=5th |location=New York |publisher=[[Teachers College Press]] |isbn=9780807756805 |oclc=921102633 |pages=107–120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fullan also noted: "Transforming the ''culture'' of schools and the systems within which they operate is the main point. It is not an innovation to be implemented, but rather a new culture to be developed."&lt;ref name="Fullan"/&gt;

==Attributes==
There are many core characteristics of PLCs including collective teamwork in which leadership and responsibility for student [[learning]] are extensively shared, a focus on [[Self-reflection|reflective]] [[inquiry]] and [[dialogue]] among educators, collective emphasis on improving student learning, shared values and norms, and development of common practices and [[feedback]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stoll |first1=Louise |last2=Bolam |first2=Ray |last3=McMahon |first3=Agnes |last4=Wallace |first4=Mike |last5=Thomas |first5=Sally |date=December 2006 |title=Professional learning communities: a review of the literature |journal=Journal of Educational Change |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=221–258 |doi=10.1007/s10833-006-0001-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2005 report by the [[Ontario Ministry of Education]] titled ''Education for All'' indicates the characteristics of PLCs are as follows:&lt;ref name="EFA"/&gt;{{rp|54}}

*Shared vision and values that lead to a collective commitment of school staff, which is expressed in day-to-day practices
*Solutions actively sought, openness to new ideas
*Working teams cooperate to achieve common goals
*Encouragement of experimentation as an opportunity to learn
*Questioning of the status quo, leading to an ongoing quest for improvement and professional learning
*Continuous improvement based on evaluation of outcomes rather than on the intentions expressed

Around the time that the term ''professional learning community'' was coined, a group of education researchers became interested in the similar idea of "professional community" in schools.&lt;ref name="Kruse"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kruse |first1=Sharon |last2=Louis |first2=Karen Seashore |last3=Bryk |first3=Anthony |date=Spring 1994 |title=Building professional community in schools |journal=Issues in Restructuring Schools |issue=6 |pages=3–6 |url=http://www.wcer.wisc.edu/archive/cors/issues_in_restructuring_schools/issues_no_6_spring_1994.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Anfara"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Anfara |first1=Vincent A. |last2=Caskey |first2=Micki M. |last3=Carpenter |first3=Jan |date=August 2015 |title=Organizational models for teacher learning |journal=Middle School Journal |volume=43 |pages=52–62 |doi=10.1080/00940771.2012.11461830 |url=http://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/ci_fac/6/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on data they collected in their research for the Center on Organization and Restructuring of Schools, Sharon Kruse, Karen Seashore Louis, and Anthony Bryk developed a three-part framework to describe the critical elements and supportive conditions that are necessary to establish a healthy "professional" culture.&lt;ref name="Kruse"/&gt; The components of this framework are described in the following table. Kruse and colleagues found that "in schools where professional community is strong, teachers work together more effectively, and put more efforts into creating and sustaining opportunities for student learning."&lt;ref name="Kruse" /&gt; They also suggested that the social and human resources are more important than the structural conditions in the development of professional community.

==Use of data==
{{Expand section|with=further examples of use of data in PLCs|date=May 2017}}
In their 2015 examination of middle school mathematics teachers' collaborative conversations regarding student data, Jason Brasel, Brette Garner, Britnie Kane and Ilana Horn found that the teachers used data to answer four questions:&lt;ref name="Horn"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Brasel |first1=Jason |last2=Garner |first2=Brette |last3=Kane |first3=Britnie |last4=Horn |first4=Ilana |date=November 2015 |title=Getting to the why and how: what kinds of conversations about data bring about the greatest improvements in math teaching and learning? |journal=Education Leadership |volume=73 |issue=3 |url=http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/nov15/vol73/num03/Getting-to-the-Why-and-How.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "''What'' do we need to reteach?"
* "To ''whom'' do we need to reteach it?"
* "''Why'' did students struggle with this?"
* "''How'' do we reteach it?"

The matrix in the following table shows how Brasel and colleagues found that the teachers combined these four questions to learn about two dimensions of teaching: student thinking and instruction.&lt;ref name="Horn"/&gt; The authors found that while the most productive collaborative discussions—that allowed the teachers to learn more about mathematics content, students and pedagogy—focused more on ''why'' and ''how'', the teachers tended to address only the first two questions, ''what'' and to ''whom''. While these conversations were helpful in identifying students in need of remediation, they did little in the way to improve instruction in the long run.&lt;ref name="Horn"/&gt;

==Staff development==

===Barriers to implementation===
Teachers and other educators can feel as if they are pawns in a larger game of chess where school and district leaders are making decisions that cause problems for educators trying to do their jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Buffum |first1=Austin |last2=Hinman |first2=Charles |date=May 2006 |title=Professional learning communities: reigniting passion and purpose |journal=Leadership |volume=35 |issue=5 |pages=16–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|16}} Barriers that can inhibit the development of PLCs include subject areas, because some educational subjects tend to naturally take precedence over others.&lt;ref name="RileyStoll"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Riley |first1=Kathryn |last2=Stoll |first2=Louise |date=Winter 2004 |title=Inside-out and outside-in: why schools need to think about communities in new ways |journal=Education Review |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=34–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|35}} The physical layout of the school can be another obstacle.&lt;ref name="RileyStoll"/&gt;{{rp|35}}

In the book ''Intentional Interruption: Breaking Down Learning Barriers to Professional Practice'', Steven Katz and Lisa Ain Dack identified six mental barriers to learning in PLCs: "we don't think through all possibilities; we focus on confirming our hypotheses and not challenging them; we pay too much attention to things that are vivid; we consider ourselves to be exceptions; we hesitate to take action in a new direction; we don't want others to see our vulnerabilities".&lt;ref name="KatzDack"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Katz |first1=Steven |last2=Dack |first2=Lisa A. |date=2015 |title=Intentional interruption: breaking down learning barriers to transform professional practice |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |publisher=[[Corwin Press]] |isbn=9781412998796 |oclc=795172349}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|51–68}} Katz and Dack opt for a psychological definition of learning: "Learning is the process through which experience causes permanent change in knowledge or behaviour".&lt;ref name="KatzDack" /&gt;{{rp|14}} It is the characteristic of permanence which raises the bar for all professional learning, because learning as permanent change is not easy or natural to achieve.&lt;ref name="KatzDack" /&gt;{{rp|15–17}} Katz and Dack urge designers of professional learning to avoid the "activity trap" of assuming that participation in a protocol or process guarantees real learning has occurred or putting so much emphasis on the activity that learning is lost in the shuffle.&lt;ref name="KatzDack" /&gt;{{rp|77–78}}

Because of these difficulties many teachers are turning to [[the web]] for PLCs. Teachers are finding groups through [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]], and other [[social media]] websites that allow them to interact with teachers from across their country to brainstorm and exchange ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Holmes |first1=Kathryn |last2=Preston |first2=Greg |last3=Shaw |first3=Kylie |last4=Buchanan |first4=Rachel |date=December 2013 |title='Follow' me: networked professional learning for teachers |journal=Australian Journal of Teacher Education |volume=38 |issue=12 |pages=55–65 |doi=10.14221/ajte.2013v38n12.4 |url=http://ro.ecu.edu.au/ajte/vol38/iss12/4}}&lt;/ref&gt; These groups can be helpful for those with PLCs already at their current school and those without PLCs.

===Staff as a community===
A PLC can be seen as an effective staff development team approach and a strategy for school improvement. The PLC process aims to be a reflective process where both individual and community growth is achieved, connected with the school's shared vision for learning. In his book ''The Fifth Discipline'', Peter Senge commented on the importance of building shared vision:

{{Quote|text=The practice of shared vision involves the skills of unearthing shared "pictures of the future" that foster genuine commitment and enrollment rather than compliance. In mastering this discipline, leaders learn the counter-productiveness of trying to dictate a vision, no matter how heartfelt. |author=[[Peter Senge]] |source=''[[The Fifth Discipline]]''&lt;ref name="Senge"/&gt;{{rp|9}} }}

Creation of a shared vision involves sharing diverse ideas and making [[compromise]]s so that all members are satisfied with the direction in which the organization is moving. Conflicting goals can become a source of positive development: "Top-down mandates and bottom-up energies need each other".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fullan |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Fullan |date=1999 |title=Change forces: the sequel |location=London; Philadelphia |publisher=Falmer Press |isbn=0750707569 |oclc=41363236}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|19}}

Through this commitment and creation of a shared vision the team may become empowered to work together and achieve goals. As teachers' capacity increases and they develop a sense of professional growth, they may find they are able to reach goals they could not reach on their own.

In an educational setting, a PLC may include people from multiple levels of the organization who are collaboratively and continually working together for the betterment of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Darling-Hammond |first1=Linda |last2=Wei |first2=Ruth Chung |last3=Andree |first3=Alethea |last4=Richardson |first4=Nikole |last5=Orphanos |first5=Stelios |date=2009 |title=Professional learning in the learning profession: a status report on teacher development in the U.S. and abroad: technical report |location=Dallas, TX; Stanford, CA |publisher=National Staff Development Council; School Redesign Network |oclc=912261565 |url=http://learningforward.org/docs/pdf/nsdcstudy2009.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Senge believes "it is no longer sufficient to have one person learning for the organization".&lt;ref name="Senge 2000"&gt;{{cite book |last=Senge |first=Peter M. |authorlink=Peter Senge |date=2013 |origyear=2000 |chapter=Give me a lever long enough... and single-handed I can move the world |editor-last=Grogan |editor-first=Margaret |title=The Jossey-Bass reader on educational leadership |edition=3rd |location=San Francisco |publisher=[[Jossey-Bass]] |pages=3–16 |isbn=9781118456217 |oclc=829055889 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}} A major principle of PLCs is that people learn more together than if they were on their own, if conditions are right.&lt;ref name="KatzDack"/&gt; Teachers may promote the idea of team learning to students in their classrooms, but teachers may not practice team learning in their professional lives; PLCs aim to help teachers practice the team learning that they preach. Senge suggests that when teams learn together there are beneficial results for the organization.&lt;ref name="Senge 2000"/&gt; Some school improvement evaluators have even claimed that "high-quality collaboration has become no less than an imperative".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gajda |first1=Rebecca |last2=Koliba |first2=Christopher |date=March 2007 |title=Evaluating the imperative of intraorganizational collaboration: a school improvement perspective |journal=[[American Journal of Evaluation]] |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=26–44 |doi=10.1177/1098214006296198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership==
For a school to be fully committed to implementing PLCs, the school's leadership must help establish and maintain PLCs.&lt;ref name="DuFourEaker"/&gt; Successful PLCs will require a shift in the traditional leadership structure from leader-centered (top-down) to shared leadership.&lt;ref name="DuFourEaker"/&gt; Sue C. Thompson and her colleagues pointed out how many educators often feel that "new ideas that came from someone else without teacher input" are a waste of time and do not qualify as true leadership or support.&lt;ref name="Thompson2004"/&gt;{{rp|4}} In a PLC, the view of the principal as the instructional leader changes to a view that reflects the principal as a member of a community of learners and leaders.&lt;ref name="DuFourEaker"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20700">A '''qualifications framework''' is a formalized structure in which [[learning level descriptors]] and qualifications are used in order to understand learning outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unevoc.unesco.org/go.php?q=Qualifications%20Framework|title=Qualifications Framework|last=|first=|date=|website=UNESCO-UNEVOC|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows for the ability to develop, assess and improve quality education in a number of contexts. Qualifications frameworks are typically found at the National, Regional, and International level.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002428/242887e.pdf|title=Level-setting and recognition of learning outcomes: The use of level descriptors in the twenty-first century|last=Keevy|first=James|last2=Chakroun|first2=Borhene|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100138-3|location=|pages=10, 12–13, 15–16, 21, 31–33, 35, 76–77, 80–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The origin of qualification structures can be traced back to organized education in antique civilizations such as [[Greece]], [[Sparta]], [[Rome]] and [[China]]. As no specialized career structure existed in these cultures, organized education focused on broad issues of international citizenship, and not on vocational preparedness, which was achieved mainly through informal apprenticeships. As civilizations developed, the role of social class and caste received more emphasis, and people who displayed certain competences were grouped together. The advantage of having participated in and benefited from education gradually became more visible as civilizations developed. In this respect the Chinese civilization was the most organized, with a series of levels attached to examinations, which in turn granted the right of access to public office. During the [[Middle Ages]] education had a particularly religious nature, while the late medieval centuries were categorized by a new approach to education alongside the clergy and feudal knighthood. New economic objectives as a result of the [[Crusades]] and the development of banking, importing and shipping across Europe and the West gave rise to the development of cities, and a new form of education aimed at professional life. Education became available to the middle classes, and the merchant and craft guild system developed.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;De Villiers, H. C. 1997. Affirmative action and the qualification structure. Unpublished Master's dissertation, University of Pretoria.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The first institutions of formal higher education were established at this time in the Islamic universities of [[Al-Azhar University|Al-Azhar]] in Cairo and [[Sankore Madrasah|Sankore]] in Timbuktu.&lt;ref&gt;Serpell, R. 2007. Bridging between orthodox Western higher educational practices and an African sociocultural context. ''Comparative Education'', Vol. 43, No. 1, pp. 23–51.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; By the eleventh century, universities were developing in Europe, largely in reaction to the previous narrow religious doctrine. The establishment of the [[University of Bologna]] marked the beginning of the European university tradition. This was also the time when the term 'qualification' acquired a more definite meaning, although it retained its emphasis on social class structures. The nineteenth century brought with it a wave of liberalism and consciousness of equal rights and opportunities, accompanied by increased specialization and bureaucratization.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The increased need for skilled employees eventually resulted in an emphasis on&amp;nbsp;credentials which persists to the present day. During the twentieth century the emphasis shifted to [[Human Capital Theory|human capital theory]] and technological development, eventually leading to concerns whether the education system was able to meet the demands of the labour market. At the time it was argued that the strong divisions were creating barriers to learning, and that there was a need to do away with the sharp distinction between academic and vocational systems.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

During the late 1980s, and strongly influenced by the thinking on integration but also by a focus on vocational training through a competency approach, the notion of a National Qualification Frameworks (NQF) emerged in the United Kingdom. Its roots lay in the competence approach to vocational education which was broadened by Jessup,&lt;ref&gt;Jessup, G. 1991. ''Outcomes: NVQs and the Emerging Model of Education mid Training''. New York, RoutledgeFalmer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[Scottish Action Plan]] which led to the modularization of vocational education and training in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Scottish Education Department (SED). 1983. ''16–18s in Scotland: An Action Plan''. Edinburgh, SED.&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea developed that all qualifications could be expressed in terms of outcomes without prescribing learning pathways or programmes.&lt;ref&gt;Young, M. F. D. 2005. ''National Qualifications Frameworks: Their Feasibility and Effective Implementation in Developing Countries''. Geneva, ILO.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; Within this politically charged melting pot of factors, and a renewed emphasis on the importance of lifelong learning, the first NQFs were established in Australia, England, Scotland, New Zealand, Ireland and South Africa between 1989 and 1995.&amp;nbsp;France, as a country with a different, notably non-Anglo Saxon tradition, was also a member of this group of first-generation NQFs (Bouder, 2003; Keevy et al., 2011).&lt;ref&gt;Bouder, A. 2003. Qualifications in France: towards a national framework? Journal of Education and Work, Vol. 16, No. 3, pp. 347–56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keevy, J., Charraud, A. and Allgoo, K. 2011. National qualifications frameworks developed in Anglo-Saxon and French traditions. Considerations for sustainable development in Africa. Research report for the ADEA Triennial on Education and Training in Africa, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, 27 November – 2 December 2.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of France, the NQF drew on a hierarchy of qualifications that found official expression at the end of 1960s in a nomenclature which tried to rationalize the number of students leaving the education and training system to correspond with the needs of the labour market.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Across the first-generation countries, NQFs were conceptualized as hierarchical classifications of levels of formal learning programmes and their associated qualifications and certificates.&lt;ref&gt;Coles, M., Keevy, J., Bateman, A. and Keating, J. 2014. Flying blind: policy rationales for national qualifications frameworks and how they tend to evolve.&lt;/ref&gt; Integral features of NQFs included new quality assurance and standards-setting regimes based on learning outcomes, and importantly for this study, level descriptors which are used to determine the level at which a qualification should be pegged.&lt;ref&gt;Tuck, R. 2007. An Introductory Guide to NQFs: Conceptual and Practical Issues for Policy Makers. Geneva, ILO.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;

== Construction ==
All qualifications frameworks are learning outcomes-based. In qualifications frameworks, qualifications are developed using learning outcomes, and the set of hierarchical levels they consist of are described with a set of learning level descriptors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Qualifications frameworks emerged from two complementary education and training discourses in the late 1980s: the competence approach to [[vocational education]], and the shift to learning outcomes, embedded within the broader concept of [[lifelong learning]]. As a result, the interrelationship between competences and learning outcomes was not only firmly embedded in qualifications framework thinking from the very outset, but was also used in a hybridized form.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

== National level ==
{{Main|National Qualifications Framework}}

A National Qualifications Framework (NQF) addresses the educational quality concerns of specific countries. Some examples include:
* [[Australian Qualifications Framework]] (AQF)
* [[Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework]] (SCQF)
* German Qualifications Framework (Deutsche Qualifikationsrahmen, DQR)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Regional level ==
A Regional Qualifications Framework (RQF) focuses specifically on qualifications at the regional level. Some examples include:
* [[European Qualifications Framework]] (EQF)
* [[Southern African Development Community|SADC]] RQF 
* [[Caribbean Community|CARICOM]] TVET Qualifications Framework (TVET QF) 
* [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ASEAN]] RQF
* Qualifications Framework for the [[European Higher Education Area]] (QF-EHEA) 
* Pacific Qualifications Register (PQR)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== International level/World reference levels ==
The purpose of the world reference levels lies mainly in their potential to provide a neutral and independent reference point against which a level of learning can be assessed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The idea of a set of world reference levels was considered in May 2012, during the Third International Congress on [[TVET (Technical and Vocational Education and Training)|TVET]], held in [[Shanghai|Shanghai, China]]. The research included in this report was initiated by [[UNESCO]] based on the recommendation from the Congress to the UNESCO Director-General to undertake this work. The UNESCO TVET Section, in cooperation with the European Commission's [[Directorate-General for Education and Culture|Directorate General for Education and Culture]] and the [[European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training]] (CEDEFOP), subsequently invited key organizations in [[Brussels]] to deliberate on the [[Shanghai Consensus Recommendation]]&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;UNESCO. 2012. Shanghai Consensus: Recommendations of the Third International Congress on Technical and Vocational Education and Training 'Transforming TVET: Building skills for work and life', Shanghai, People's Republic of China, 14 to 16 May.&lt;/ref&gt; in September 2013. The deliberations included regional developments in Europe, notably the [[European Qualifications Framework]] (EQF) and in Asia, notably a common standard for competences developed by the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|Association of South East Asian Nations]] (ASEAN), as well as the move towards [[regional qualifications frameworks]] (RQFs) in [[Central America]] and the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC). At the national level, the development of [[National Qualifications Framework|national qualifications frameworks]] (NQFs) was considered across and beyond these regions, including [[Mercosur]] (Mercado Común del Sur, the Common Market of the South) in South America and the development of a [[transnational qualifications framework]] (TQF) by twenty-nine small states of the Commonwealth.&lt;ref&gt;COL and SAQA. 2008. Transnational Qualifications Framework for the Virtual University of Small States of the Commonwealth. Concept Document. Pretoria: Commonwealth of Learning and South African Qualifications Authority.&lt;/ref&gt; The additional dimension of learning metrics as used in longitudinal studies, international competence assessments and diagnostics reviews was also considered.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Brussels deliberations concluded that the mobility of people (both learners and workers, including migrant workers) and jobs (including outsourcing and offshoring) constitutes an important driver for the world reference levels&lt;ref&gt;Chakroun. 2013. Outcomes of the workshop, Engaging global conversations on recognition of TVET quali cations based on learning outcomes, 25–27 September 2013, Brussels, unpublished report.&lt;/ref&gt; emanating from the Shanghai Consensus Recommendation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It was noted that jobs are not always matched to demands during these movements, because of demographic shifts and the differential capacities of economies to create jobs. The cross-border provision of education and training, as well as the technological developments resulting in increased open and distance learning, and online learning, were also identified as important drivers towards world reference levels.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Another important driver identified in the Brussels deliberations was the need for international dialogue, cooperation and capacity-building in the  field of the recognition of qualifications.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Other types of frameworks ==

=== Sectoral qualifications frameworks&amp;nbsp;===
Sectoral qualifications frameworks are developed within a specific country and with a specific sectoral focus. Examples include: 
* a TVET framework in Jamaica 
* the occupational qualifications subframework in South Africa 
* the General Education Qualifications Framework in Poland
* the Engineering Sectoral Framework in Armenia&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;

=== Transnational qualifications frameworks&amp;nbsp;===
Transnational qualifications frameworks are developed across a range of countries. Where these countries are in the same geographical proximity they are referred to as regional qualifications frameworks (examples include the SADC RQF and the EQF). Transnational qualifications frameworks can also be developed across countries that are not in the same geographic proximity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;

=== For online learning ===

==== The E-xcellence framework ====
The E-xcellence framework was developed by the European Association of Distance Teaching Universities (EADTU). It is an instrument for benchmarking the quality of online, open and flexible education at programme, faculty and institutional levels. The framework defines requirements (called "benchmarks") for the entire process, from [[Curriculum development|curriculum design]] to delivery, including the management and support of online and blended learning.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002451/245122E.pdf|title=Making Sense of MOOCs: A Guide for Policy-Makers in Developing Countries|last=Patru|first=Mariana|last2=Balaji|first2=Venkataraman|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2016|isbn=978-92-3-100157-4|location=|pages=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The OpenupEd quality label ====
The OpenupEd quality label is derived from the E-xcellence framework. Ossiannilsson and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;Ossiannilsson, E., Williams, K., Camilleri, A., &amp; Brown, M. (2015). ''Quality models in online and open education around the globe: State of the art and recommendations''. Oslo, Norway: International Council for Open and Distance Education.&lt;/ref&gt; identified this framework as useful for certification and benchmarking. The label describes a self-assessment and review Quality Assurance (QA) process for the [[Massive open online course|MOOCs]] (Massive open online courses) in the European OpenupEd partnership,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.openuped.eu&lt;/ref&gt; but the OpenupEd framework can be used for the QA of any MOOC. The benchmarks statements in this label, derived from benchmarks produced by the E-xcellence framework, are divided into two groups: those that apply at the institutional level and those for individual courses (MOOCs).&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

== Learning level descriptors ==
{{Main|Learning level descriptors}}

Learning level descriptors are essential elements in Qualifications Frameworks. Learning Level descriptors are statements that provide a broad indication of learning appropriate to attainment at a particular level, describing the characteristics and context of learning expected at that level. They are designed to support the reviewing of specified learning outcomes and assessment criteria in order to develop particular modules and units and to assign credits at the appropriate level.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vlasceanu, L., Grünberg, L. and Pârlea, D. 2007. Quality assurance and accreditation: a glossary of basic terms and de nitions. Bucharest, UNESCO Centre Européen pour l'Enseignement Supérieur (CEPES). &lt;nowiki&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0013/001346/134621e.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Learning outcomes ==
A learning outcome is a measurable result of a learning experience which allows us to ascertain to which extent / level / standard a competence has been formed or enhanced.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Lokho , J., Wegewijs, B., Durkin, K., Wagenaar, R., González, J., Isaacs, A., Rose, L. and Gobbi, M. (eds). 2010. ''A Tuning Guide to Formulating Degree Programme Profiles Including Programme Competences and Programme Learning Outcomes''. Bilbao, Groningen and The Hague. Manabile, E. 2007. Summary of the revised Bloom's taxonomy. Unpublished.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learning outcomes can be used to describe many things, including knowledge, skills and competences (KSC), in the context of qualifications frameworks. Learning outcomes are increasingly being used in global context 'as a dynamic tool for modernisation and reform'.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;CEDEFOP. 2009. ''The Shift to Learning Outcomes''. Luxembourg, CEDEFOP.&lt;/ref&gt; The key mechanism through which the learning outcomes approach is being implemented is qualifications frameworks, but there are also others, such as within [[curriculum]] reform on both national and international levels. [[The Tuning Project]], which started in 2000, stands out as a good example of the introduction of learning outcomes outside of, but nonetheless related to, qualifications frameworks. Learning outcomes are used in the formulation of qualifications, and also in the formulation of level descriptors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Definitions of the concept of learning outcomes vary across contexts, although some common elements can be identified. Here are several definitions. Learning outcomes...
* Describe what students will know and be able to do upon successful completion of a course or programme.&lt;ref&gt;University of Adelaide. 2014. Guide to writing learning outcomes. www.adelaide.edu.au&lt;/ref&gt;
* The contextually demonstrated end-products of specific learning processes which include knowledge, skills and values.&lt;ref&gt;SAQA. 2014. NQFpedia: Standard Glossary of Terms. www.saqa.org.za&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Statements of what a learner knows, understands and is able to do after the completion of learning.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* A statement of what students should know, understand and can do upon the completion of a period of study.&lt;ref&gt;MQA. 2011. ''Malaysian Qualifications Framework. Point of Reference and joint understanding of higher education qualifications in Malaysia''. Kuala Lumpur, Malaysian Quali cations Authority.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Knowledge, skill, and aspects of competence that a learner is expected to know and be able to do.&lt;ref&gt;NQAUAE. 2012. ''Qualifications Framework Emirates Handbook''. Abu Dhabi, NQAUAE.&lt;/ref&gt;
From a review of the interpretation of learning outcomes it is evident that learning outcomes are understood to be statements that describe mainly three major domains: knowledge (learning to know), skills (learning to do) and competences (learning to be).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 1996. Learning: ''The Treasure Within. Report of the International Commission on Education for the 21st Century''. Paris, UNESCO.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Competences ===
The interrelationship between learning outcomes and competences is best illustrated in qualifications frameworks.&amp;nbsp;While learning outcomes often describe competences, competences can also be stand alone. Competences represent a dynamic combination of cognitive and meta-cognitive skills, demonstration of knowledge and understanding, interpersonal, intellectual and practical skills, and ethical values.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2780">'''Robots and Avatars''' was a programme of events and [[education]]al activities which explores how young people will work and play with new representational forms of virtual and physical life in 10–15 years time. It was produced by [[Body data space|body&gt;data&gt;space]] with support from [[National Endowment for Science Technology and the Arts|NESTA]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stanza.co.uk/emergentcity/?p=363&lt;/ref&gt; between 2009 and 2012.

The project examined multi-identity evolutions of younger generations within the context of a world in which virtual and physical spaces are increasingly blended. A participatory web and events led programme with connected educational activities took taking place across 2010 and onwards, in the UK and internationally. The project included contributions by a diverse range of experts, professionals and specialists working with robots and avatars including Professor [[Noel Sharkey]] (Professor of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics and Professor of Public Engagement University of Sheffield), Pear Urishima (Apple), [[Ghislaine Boddington]] from body&gt;data&gt;space and [[Derek Richards]] from [[Hi8us]] South.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apengine.org/2010/06/robots-and-avatars/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Robots and Avatars Forum==
Robots and Avatars launched in November 2009 with a Forum at NESTA, attended by an international group of 80 experts, professionals and young people in [[London]].

==Robots and Avatars Lunch Debates==
Between June and November 2010 the programme hosted a series of Lunch Debates exploring Artificial Intelligence, Behaviour and Ethics, Health and Wellbeing and the Future Workplace with expert provocateurs and top level thinkers.

==The Overall Programme==
The programme continued throughout 2010-2011 with educational events, an [[exhibition]], a [[website]], [[vodcast]]s with key experts and a book/[[DVD]].

[[File:Statsraad Lehmkuhl2.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Built in 1914 as [[Grossherzog Friedrich August]], a school training ship for the German merchant marine, the since 1921 Norwegian-owned [[Statsraad Lehmkuhl]] is one of the oldest sail training ships in service]]
From its modern interpretations to its antecedents when [[maritime nation]]s would send young naval officer candidates to sea (e.g., see [[Outward Bound]]), '''sail training''' provides an unconventional and effective way of building many useful skills on and off the water. 

== Background ==
By 1900 most commercial sailing vessels were struggling to turn a profit in the face of competition from more modern [[Steamboat|steam ships]] which had become efficient enough to steam shorter [[great circle]] routes between ports instead of the longer [[trade wind]] routes used by [[sailing ships]].

Ships were built larger to carry bulk cargoes more efficiently, their rigs were simplified to reduce manning costs and speed was no longer a premium. Owners shipped cargoes that were non-perishable so that their date of arrival (which steam ships had started to guarantee) were of less importance. Finally as the [[Panama Canal]] was opened, sailing ships were used in parts of the world where steam ships still found it hard to operate: principally on 
*the [[Chile]]an [[nitrate trade]] (for fertilizers and explosive production in Europe), and on
*the Australian [[grain trade]].
Both Chile and Australian ports were difficult to supply with coal for steamships to refuel. Also, both routes to Europe went round [[Cape Horn]].

The end of the First World War saw a brief return to profitability as all ship types were in scarce supply due to wartime losses but that boom became bust as many new [[steam ships]] were built to replace the sailing ships that were lost.

== Genesis in the 1930s ==
[[File:Amerigo vespucci 1976 nyc aufgetakelt.jpg|thumbnail|[[Italian navy]] training ship ''[[Italian training ship Amerigo Vespucci|Amerigo Vespucci]]'', launched in 1931.]]

While many countries of the world operated sailing ships as [[school ship|training vessels]] for officers in their [[Merchant marine|Merchant Marine]] in the 1920s and 30s, several sailing ship owners such as [[Carl Laeisz]] and [[Gustaf Erikson]] determined that there was still a profit to be made from the last of the sailing ships.  

Erikson purchased existing ships that required the minimum of [[Capital (economics)|capital]] investment and repaired them with parts cannibalised from other ships. Identifying the bulk cargo routes that would still offer paying freights, he manned the ships with a smattering of paid experienced officers.  

Some of the deckhands were [[Apprenticeship|apprentices]] from steamship lines and other adventurous youth who had paid a premium to sail while being trained, some recruited for very modest salaries. The apprentices were considered trainees and were the first formalization of sail trainers with crew drawn from members of the public who just went for the adventure, as opposed to a career.  

With manning costs netted out on Erikson's balance sheet, the ships continued to return a paper [[Profit (accounting)|profit]]. However Erikson was under no illusions as to the long term profitability of his venture, which depended on ignoring the [[depreciation]] on his ships and a shrinking supply of sound [[Hull (watercraft)|hulls]] and [[Rigging|rigs]]. The company would use their profits to diversify into steam after World War II. While the shipping companies of Erickson and [[F. Laeisz]] gradually turned to [[steam engine|steam]], the next generation of captains were climbing up the [[hawsehole]] and taking command of their own vessels, redefining sail training as a purely educational endeavour with trainees as the cargo.

From 1932 through 1958, [[Irving Johnson]] and his wife [[Electa Johnson|Electa "Exy" Johnson]] [[circumnavigation|circumnavigated]] the world 7 times with amateur youth crews on board their vessels named ''Yankee''. Over the years, their voyages were featured in books they authored, and in [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] magazines and TV specials like ''"Irving Johnson, High Seas Adventurer"''. Their archives are at [[Mystic Seaport]], Connecticut.  

Australian [[Alan Villiers]] purchased the old school ship ''George Stage'' from Denmark in 1934.  Renaming her the ''[[Joseph Conrad (ship)|Joseph Conrad]]'', he sailed her round the world with no paying cargo and a crew of youth who had paid to be there.  He also took as many non-paying youth as he could afford to fit in the budget, those he considered at risk on the streets of their inner cities and in need of what was then called "character building".  These trips were the genesis of current modern sail training, using manually operated ships and the harsh discipline imposed by the sea to further personal development and taking those disadvantaged by circumstance to benefit from the experience.&lt;ref name="King1988"&gt;{{cite book

By the end of World War II, the numbers of traditionally rigged sailing ships left were dwindling and public interest waned. After the German school ship [[Niobe (schooner)|Niobe]] had sunk in 1932, killing 69, the loss of the ''[[Pamir (ship)|Pamir]]'' in 1957 and the ''[[Albatross (ship, built in 1920)|Albatross]]'' in 1961 drew further ill will and seemed to signal the end of an era.&lt;ref name="Parrott2004"&gt;{{cite book

== Modern sail training ==
[[File:Downhaul.jpg|thumb|Cadets man headsails sheets on the ''[[USCGC Eagle (WIX-327)|Eagle]]'']]
In what was conceived to be last great gathering of [[Square rig|square-riggers]] under sail, Bernard Morgan and Greville Howard persuaded a number of ship owners to join together in a sort of farewell salute in 1956, organizing a race from [[Torbay]] on the South Coast of England to race informally across the [[Bay of Biscay]] to [[Lisbon]] in [[Portugal]].  Five square rigged [[school ship]]s entered the race, Denmark's ''[[Danmark (ship)|Danmark]]'', Norway's ''[[Christian Radich (ship)|Christian Radich]]'' and ''Sorlandet'', Belgium's ''Mercator'' and Portugal's first ''[[Sagres (ship)|Sagres]]''. The vessels would meet again the following year and every year since in an annual series that would astonish its original organizers today. Old vessels were saved or repaired and new purpose built sail training vessels were commissioned. With renewed interest in the age of sail, national sail training associations affiliated to [[Sail Training International]] (STI) (formerly "Sail Training Association") were organized and large summer events find upwards of 100 ships racing across the oceans.

Crew exchanges allow young people from one country to sail with those from another. Long before the end of the [[Cold War]], ships from [[Russia]] and [[Poland]] (which in some cases had been built in Germany) joined the International Fleet in 1974. A limited exchange between the [[Eastern bloc|East]] and West was initiated. One of the largest of the affiliate organizations of the STI is the [[American Sail Training Association]] (ASTA). Founded in 1973 with a handful of vessels, it has since grown to encompass an international organization with more than 250 tall ships representing 25 different countries. The UK National Member of STI is the Association of Sail Training Organisations (ASTO) Founded in 1972, http://www.asto.org.uk

Square rigged seamanship was in danger of becoming a lost art. As the 1997 restoration of the [[USS Constitution|USS ''Constitution'']] neared completion, the [[United States Navy]] called on the crew of [[HMS Bounty|HMS ''Bounty'']]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.tallshipbounty.org/the-ship/RobinWalbridge.php | title = TallShipBounty.org | accessdate = 11 October 2010 | quote = The highlight of his career, however, is the two years and over 15 voyages spent training the crew of "Old Ironsides," the U.S.S. Constitution. He was at the helm as guest Captain/Advisor for the ship's inaugural sail in 1997 after 116 years of being dormant, a moment he remembers as "awe-inspiring," as many in his position would. | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121101023334/http://www.tallshipbounty.org/the-ship/RobinWalbridge.php | archivedate = 1 November 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; to train her sailors to sail the vessel as originally intended.

Many boats are historical vessels and replicas which require coordinated manual labor to sail, operating in the original tradition proposed by Alan Villiers and Irving Johnson such as the ''[[Picton Castle (ship)|Picton Castle]]'' while others are purpose built educational platforms carrying out scientific research under sail such as the ''[[Robert C. Seamans (ship)|Robert C. Seamans]]'' and the ''[[Corwith Cramer (ship)|Corwith Cramer]]'' of the [[Sea Education Association]]. Another new direction is the development of floating maritime heritage centres, connected to a sail training organisation, and often in co-ordination with land based maritime museums. [[Tall Ship Atyla]] is one such example of this, with visitors to the Bilbao Maritime Museum enjoying free entry to the ship during the winter months when she is moored nearby.  As the crew of the ''[[Irving Johnson (Tall ship)|Irving Johnson]]'' and the award winning program at the Los Angeles Maritime Institute like to say ''"We do not train youth for a life at sea ... we use the sea to educate youth for life"''.

== Vessel classifications ==
[[Tall ship]]s have been found to be effective platforms for sail training as they combine many elements fundamental to sail training.
A "Tall ship" is not a strictly defined type of vessel. "Tall ship" is commonly used today to define a large, traditionally rigged vessel, whether or not is it technically a ship.  For example, the [[USCGC Eagle (WIX-327)|USCGC ''Eagle'']] is technically a [[barque]] and not a [[full rigged ship]].  A tall ship is usually defined by the topmast and [[topsail]]s she carries as opposed to the modern high aspect ratio rigs and [[Bermuda rig|marconi mains]] carried by the [[sloop]]s and [[yawl]]s seen in every harbor today.

For the purpose of classification and race rating, the STI divides Tall ships into the following classes :

:'''Class A''': All vessels over 160 feet in length overall, regardless of rig, and [[square rig]]ged vessels over 120 feet in length.
:'''Class A; Division II''': All square rigged vessels less than 120 feet in length.
:'''Class B''': [[Fore-and-aft rig|Fore-and-aft]] rigged vessels between 100 feet and 160 feet in length
:'''Class C''': All other fore-and-aft rigged vessels at least 30 feet long at the [[waterline]].

The [[United States Coast Guard]] classifies vessels based on their intended use and structure, prescribing requirements for  [[Captain (nautical)|captain]] and crew manning, waters the vessel may operate in, number of passengers allowed and minimum safety equipment required.

With the exception of uninspected vessels, all such vessels are inspected annually and issued a Certificate of Inspection (COI) which must be displayed on the vessel and spells out the requirements that vessel must maintain. 

:'''Sailing School Vessel (SSV)''':  Inspected under Title 46, Subchapter R of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).  An SSV is a vessel of less than 500 gross tons carrying six or more sailing school students or instructors, primarily propelled by sail, and operated by a nonprofit educational organization exclusively for the purpose of sailing education.

:'''Passenger Vessel''': Certified according to the size and number of passengers (not engaged in educational activities or in the operation of the vessel) carried under Title 46 of the CFR.
::'''Subchapter C''': Uninspected vessels which operate with no more than six passengers.
::'''Subchapter T''': Small passenger vessels of under 100 gross tons that carry more than six passengers and are required to pass regular USCG inspection of the ship and all onboard equipment.
::'''Subchapter K''': Small passenger vessels of under 100 gross tons that carry more than 150 passengers and are required to pass regular USCG inspection of the ship and all onboard equipment.
::'''Subchapter H''': Passenger vessels of more than 100 gross tons that carry passengers for hire and are required to pass regular USCG inspection of the ship and all onboard equipment.

:'''Attraction Vessel''': Certification is required whenever a vessel is open to public boarding or conducts dockside programs.  The vessel may be permanently moored to a pier, or it may be certified under one or more of the above subchapters, but the Attraction Vessel COI certifies its safety for dockside and visitation only.

:'''Oceanographic Research Vessel (ORV)''': Certified under Subchapter U  of Title 46 of the CFR.  An ORV is a vessel employed exclusively in either oceanographic (saltwater) or limnologic (freshwater) instruction and/or research, and is not necessarily equipped for passengers or other non-professionals.

'''''Schooling in Capitalist America: Educational Reform and the Contradictions of Economic Life''''' is a 1976 book by Marxist economists [[Samuel Bowles (economist)|Samuel Bowles]] and [[Herbert Gintis]]. Widely considered a groundbreaking work in [[sociology of education]],{{fact|date=November 2014}} it argues the "correspondence principle" explains how the internal organization of schools corresponds to the internal organisation of the [[Capitalism|capitalist]] workforce in its structures, norms, and values. For example, the authors assert the hierarchy system in schools reflects the structure of the [[Labour economics|labour market]], with the head teacher as the managing director, pupils fall lower down in the hierarchy. Wearing uniforms and discipline are promoted among students from working class, as it would be in the workplace for lower levels employees. Education provides knowledge of how to interact in the workplace and gives direct preparation for entry into the labour market. 

They also believe work casts a "long shadow" in education – education is used by the [[bourgeoisie]] to control the workforce. From their point of view schools reproduce existing inequalities and they reject the notion that there are equal opportunities for all. In this way they argue that education justifies and explains social inequality.

The book is now{{when|date=November 2014}} considered the key text for the Marxist theory of sociology of education.{{fact|date=November 2014}}

==Criticisms==
Bowles and Gintis have been criticised:
* Philip Brown and Hugh Lauder (1991) argue that Bowles and Gintis have simplified the correspondence between education and the labour market. They go on further to state that there are changes in the importance of bureaucratic control in work organisations – it has reduced and there is an increased importance of team working.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/0962021910010102|title=Education, Economy and Social Change|last=Lauder|first=Hugh|last2=Brown|first2=Phillip|date=1991|website=|publisher=International Studies in Sociology of Education, Vol. 1|doi=10.1080/0962021910010102|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Michael Apple]] (1982, 1986) examined the hidden curriculum and concludes teachers are being [[Proletarianization|proletarianised]] as the profession is de-skilled through the standardised curriculum. This increases state control over teachers and how they carry out their functions. He believes schools are sites of struggle and reproduction of inequalities persist. The formal curriculum is class biased. Reproduction of high status academic knowledge is prioritised through the schooling of those who are not poor or part of a minority. Textbooks neglect social conflict, which contribute to the ideological reproduction of capitalism.
* However Ramsey (1983) conducted a larger survey of schools and found a great deal of variation among working class schools.
* Hannan and Boyle (1987) argue the management and attitude of teachers control the ethos of a working class school, not all working class schools prepare their students for failing.
* David Reynolds (1984) – Bowles and Gintis ignore the influence of the formal curriculum. Much of the British school curriculum does not promote the development of an ideal employee under capitalism. The curriculum fails to teach skills needed by employers.
* Willis (1977) – Bowles and Gintis did not carry out detailed research into life in schools and they made assumptions that the hidden curriculum was actually influencing pupils. Many pupils had disrespect for the school rules and for the authority of the teacher. Working class "lads" learned to behave at school in ways that do not fit with capitalism's need for a passive workforce.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="53725">'''Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics''' ('''STEM'''), previously [[Science]], [[Math]], [[Engineering]] and [[Technology]] ('''SMET'''), is a term used to group together these [[academic disciplines]].&lt;ref name="fas.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42642.pdf|format=PDF|title=Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Education: A Primer|website=Fas.org|accessdate=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This term is typically used when addressing education policy and [[curriculum]] choices in schools to improve competitiveness in science and technology development. It has implications for workforce development, national security concerns and immigration policy.&lt;ref name="fas.org"/&gt;

The [[acronym]] came into common use shortly after an interagency meeting on science education held at the US [[National Science Foundation]]{{when?|date=May 2018}} chaired by the then NSF director [[Rita Colwell]].&lt;ref&gt;Compare: {{Cite web|url= http://www.naplesnews.com/opinion/perspectives/guest-commentary-a-stem-in-collier-county-to-reach-their-future-2392f62e-9c19-2198-e053-0100007f6ee5-341858231.html|title= Guest commentary: A "STEM" in Collier County to reach their future|website= Naplesnews.com|access-date= 2016-06-09 | quote = The acronym STEM was suggested by Rita Colwell, Ph.D., a bacteriologist who was director of NSF in the 1980s.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
A director from the Office of Science division of Workforce Development for Teachers and Scientists, Peter Faletra, suggested the change from the older acronym SMET to STEM. Colwell, expressing some dislike for the older acronym, responded by suggesting NSF institute the change. However, the acronym STEM predates NSF and likely traces its origin to Charles Vela, the founder and director of the Center for the Advancement of Hispanics in Science and Engineering Education (CAHSEE)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cahsee.org/about/about.asp.htm|title=CAHSEE - About CAHSEE|website=www.cahsee.org|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://stem.ccny.cuny.edu/|title=STEM Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics - Main|website=stem.ccny.cuny.edu|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kqnRETS9FWwC|title=Hispanic Engineer &amp; IT|last=Group|first=Career Communications|date=1996|publisher=Career Communications Group|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  In the early 1990's CAHSEE started a summer program for talented under-represented students in the Washington, DC area called the STEM Institute.  Based on the program's recognized success and his expertise in STEM education&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=100381&amp;org=HRD&amp;from=news|title=President Bush Honors Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring {{!}} NSF - National Science Foundation|website=www.nsf.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Charles Vela was asked to serve on numerous NSF and Congressional panels in science, mathematics and engineering education&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cahsee.org/about/founder.asp.htm|title=CAHSEE - Founder's Biography|website=www.cahsee.org|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;; it is through this manner that NSF was first introduced to the acronym STEM.  One of the first NSF projects to use the acronym{{cn|date=May 2018}} was STEMTEC, the Science, Technology, Engineering and Math Teacher Education Collaborative at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], which was founded in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;

==Geographic distribution==

===United States===

In the United States, the acronym began to be used in education and immigration debates in initiatives to begin to address the perceived lack of qualified candidates for high-tech jobs. It also addresses concern that the subjects are often taught in isolation, instead of as an integrated curriculum.&lt;ref name="STEM PA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iu1stemcenter.org/files/CMU_and_IU_STEM_Survey.pdf |title=STEM Education in Southwestern Pennsylvania |year=2008 |publisher=The Intermediate Unit 1 Center for STEM Education |accessdate=2012-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Maintaining a citizenry that is well versed in the STEM fields is a key portion of the [[public education]] agenda of the United States.&lt;ref name="USNEWS2012"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/stem-education/2012/07/26/us-news-inducts-five-to-stem-leadership-hall-of-fame |title=U.S. News Inducts Five to STEM Leadership Hall of Fame |date=July 26, 2012 |author=Morella, Michael |publisher=U.S. News &amp; World Report |accessdate=2012-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The acronym has been widely used in the immigration debate regarding access to United States [[work visa]]s for [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants]] who are skilled in these fields. It has also become commonplace in education discussions as a reference to the shortage of skilled workers and inadequate education in these areas.&lt;ref name="Bill Clinton Lays Out"&gt;{{cite news

====National Science Foundation====
Many organizations in the United States follow the guidelines of the [[National Science Foundation]] on what constitutes a STEM field. The NSF uses a broader definition of STEM subjects that includes subjects in the fields of [[chemistry]], [[Computer science|computer]] and [[information technology]] science, engineering, geosciences, life sciences, mathematical sciences, physics and astronomy, [[social sciences]] ([[anthropology]], [[economics]], [[psychology]] and [[sociology]]), and STEM education and learning research.&lt;ref name="fas.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nsf.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2012/nsf12599/nsf12599.htm#appendix|title=Graduate Research Fellowship Program|work=nsf.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eligibility for scholarship programs such as the CSM STEM Scholars Program use the NSF definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmd.edu/istem/scholarship_stem.html |title=ISTEM – College of Southern Maryland }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NSF is the only American federal agency whose mission includes support for all fields of fundamental science and engineering, except for medical sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nsf.gov/about/what.jsp |title=What We Do |publisher=The National Science Foundation |accessdate=2012-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its disciplinary program areas include scholarships, grants, fellowships in fields such as biological sciences, computer and [[information science]] and  engineering, education and human resources, engineering, environmental research and education, geosciences, international science and engineering, mathematical and physical sciences, social, behavioral and economic sciences, cyberinfrastructure, and polar programs.&lt;ref name="nsf.gov"/&gt;

====Immigration policy====
Although many organizations in the United States follow the guidelines of the [[National Science Foundation]] on what constitutes a STEM field, the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) has its own functional definition used for immigration policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42530.pdf|format=PDF|title=Immigration of Foreign Nationals with Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Degrees|website=Fas.org|accessdate=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, DHS or ICE announced an expanded list of STEM designated-degree programs that qualify eligible graduates on student visas for an optional practical training (OPT) extension. Under the OPT program, international students who graduate from colleges and universities in the United States are able to remain in the country and receive training through work experience for up to 12 months. Students who graduate from a designated STEM degree program can remain for an additional 17 months on an OPT STEM extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DHS Expands List of STEM designated-degree programs|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/dhs-expands-list-stem-designated-degree-programs |publisher=Fowler White Boggs P.A. |author=Jennifer G.

====STEM-eligible degrees in US immigration====
{{Details|topic=Temporary foreign workers|Global labor arbitrage|H-1B visa|Optional Practical Training}}

An exhaustive list of STEM disciplines does not exist because the definition varies by organization. The [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] lists disciplines including&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ice.gov/sevis/stemlist.htm |title=STEM Designated Degree Programs |date=April 2008 |publisher=U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement |accessdate=2012-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[physics]], [[actuarial science]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[mathematics]], [[applied mathematics]], [[statistics]], [[computer science]], [[computational science]], [[psychology]], [[biochemistry]], [[robotics]], [[computer engineering]], [[electrical engineering]], [[electronics]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[industrial engineering]], [[information science]], [[information technology]], [[civil engineering]], [[aerospace engineering]], [[chemical engineering]], [[astrophysics]], [[astronomy]], [[optics]], [[nanotechnology]], [[nuclear physics]], [[mathematical biology]], [[operations research]], [[neurobiology]], [[biomechanics]], [[bioinformatics]], [[acoustical engineering]], [[geographic information system]]s, [[atmospheric sciences]], [[Educational technology|educational/instructional technology]], [[software engineering]], and [[educational research]].

====Education====
By cultivating an interest in the natural and social sciences in preschool or immediately following school entry, the chances of STEM success in high school can be greatly improved. [[School segregation|School integration]] can  help black, Hispanic and aboriginal students catch up with Asian and white students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

STEM supports broadening the study of [[engineering]] within each of the other subjects, and beginning engineering at younger grades, even elementary school. It also brings STEM education to all students rather than only the gifted programs. In his 2012 budget, President Barack Obama renamed and broadened the "''Mathematics and Science Partnership (MSP)''" to award block grants to states for improving teacher education in those subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2012/02/obamas-budget-shuffles-stem.html |title=Obama's Budget Shuffles STEM Education Deck |date=14 February 2012 |author=Jane J.

In the 2015 run of the international assessment test the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), American students came out 35th in mathematics, 24th in reading and 25th in science, out of 109 countries. The United States also ranked 29th in the percentage of 24-year-olds with science or mathematics degrees&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/pisa/|title=Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) - Overview|website=nces.ed.gov|language=EN|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

STEM education often uses new technologies such as [[RepRap]] [[3D printers]] to encourage interest in STEM fields.&lt;ref&gt;J.L. Irwin, D.E. Oppliger, J.M. Pearce, G. Anzalone, [http://www.asee.org/file_server/papers/attachment/file/0005/4988/asee_K-12_2015_finalpaper.pdf Evaluation of RepRap 3D Printer Workshops in K-12 STEM]. ''122nd ASEE 122nd ASEE Conf.

In 2006 the [[United States National Academies]] expressed their concern about the declining state of STEM education in the United States. Its Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy developed a list of 10 actions. Their top three recommendations were to:
* Increase America's talent pool by improving K–12 science and mathematics education
* Strengthen the skills of teachers through additional training in science, mathematics and technology
* Enlarge the pipeline of students prepared to enter college and graduate with STEM degrees&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.slsd.org/webpages/rcolelli/resources.cfm?subpage=493006|title=STEM Education|website=Slsd.org|access-date=2016-06-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170126095634/http://www.slsd.org/webpages/rcolelli/resources.cfm?subpage=493006|archivedate=2017-01-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] also has implemented programs and curricula to advance STEM education in order to replenish the pool of scientists, engineers and mathematicians who will lead space exploration in the 21st century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Individual states, such as [[California]], have run pilot after-school STEM programs to learn what the most promising practices are and how to implement them to increase the chance of student success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://powerofdiscovery.org/sites/default/files/cde_report_task_10_and_11.pdf|format=PDF|title=Final Report : California Department of Education : CDE Agreement|website=Powerofdiscovery.org|accessdate=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another state to invest in STEM education is Florida, where [https://floridapolytechnic.org/ Florida Polytechnic University], Florida’s first public university for engineering and technology dedicated to science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = About Florida Polytechnic University|url = https://floridapolytechnic.org/about/|website = Florida Polytechnic University|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During school, STEM programs have been established for many districts throughout the U.S.  Some states include [[New Jersey]], [[Arizona]], [[Virginia]], [[North Carolina]], [[Texas]], and [[Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.olentangy.k12.oh.us/domain/1012|title=STEM Academy / Overview|website=www.olentangy.k12.oh.us|language=en|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/best-high-schools/national-rankings/stem|title=Best STEM High schools|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====American Competitiveness Initiative====
In the [[State of the Union Address]] on January 31, 2006, President [[George W. Bush]] announced the [[American Competitiveness Initiative]]. Bush proposed the initiative to address shortfalls in federal government support of educational development and progress at all academic levels in the STEM fields. In detail, the initiative called for significant increases in federal funding for advanced [[R&amp;D]] programs (including a doubling of federal funding support for advanced research in the physical sciences through [[United States Department of Energy|DOE]]) and an increase in U.S. higher education graduates within STEM disciplines.

The ''NASA Means Business'' competition, sponsored by the Texas Space Grant Consortium, furthers that goal. College students compete to develop promotional plans to encourage students in middle and high school to study STEM subjects and to inspire professors in STEM fields to involve their students in outreach activities that support STEM education.

The [[National Science Foundation]] has numerous programs in STEM education, including some for K–12 students such as the ITEST Program that supports The Global Challenge Award ITEST Program. STEM programs have been implemented in some [[Arizona]] schools. They implement higher cognitive skills for students and enable them to inquire and use techniques used by professionals in the STEM fields.

The STEM Academy is a national nonprofit-status organization dedicated to improving STEM literacy for all students. It represents a recognized national next-generation high-impact academic model. The practices, strategies, and programming are built upon a foundation of identified national best practices which are designed to improve under-represented minority and low-income student growth, close achievement gaps, decrease dropout rates, increase high school graduation rates and improve teacher and principal effectiveness. The STEM Academy represents a flexible use academic model that targets all schools and is for all students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stem101.org/about.asp|title=stemacademy|website=Stem101.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Project Lead The Way]] (PLTW) is a leading provider of STEM education curricular programs to middle and high schools in the United States. The national nonprofit organization has over 5,200 programs in over 4,700 schools in all 50 states. Programs include a high school engineering curriculum called ''Pathway To Engineering'', a high school biomedical sciences program, and a middle school engineering and technology program called ''Gateway To Technology''. PLTW provides the curriculum and the teacher professional development and ongoing support to create transformational programs in schools, districts, and communities. PLTW programs have been endorsed by President [[Barack Obama]] and [[United States Secretary of Education]] [[Arne Duncan]] as well as various state, national, and business leaders.

Women constitute 47% of the U.S. workforce, and perform 24% of STEM-related jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.doc.gov/reports/women-stem-2017-update|title=Women in STEM: 2017 Update| access-date=September 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK women perform 13% of STEM-related jobs (2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westminster.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/business/2014/science-careers-face-diversity-challenge|title=Science careers face diversity challenge|work=westminster.ac.uk|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018110732/http://www.westminster.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/business/2014/science-careers-face-diversity-challenge|archivedate=2014-10-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S. women with STEM degrees are more likely to work in education or healthcare rather than STEM fields compared with their male counterparts.

The gender ratio depends on field of study. For example, in the [[European Union]] in 2012 women made up 47.3% of the total, 51% of the social sciences, business and law, 42% of the science, mathematics and computing, 28% of engineering, manufacturing and construction, and 59% of PhD graduates in Health and Welfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|date= 2016|title= She Figures 2015|url= https://ec.europa.eu/research/swafs/pdf/pub_gender_equality/she_figures_2015-final.pdf#view=fit&amp;pagemode=none|publisher= European Commission|page= |access-date= 15 September 2018 |ISBN=978-92-79-48375-2|doi=10.2777/744106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The focus on increasing participation in STEM fields has attracted criticism. In the 2014 article "The Myth of the Science and Engineering Shortage" in ''[[The Atlantic]]'', demographer Michael S. Teitelbaum criticized the efforts of the U.S. government to increase the number of STEM graduates, saying that, among studies on the subject, "No one has been able to find any evidence indicating current widespread labor market shortages or hiring difficulties in science and engineering occupations that require bachelor's degrees or higher", and that "Most studies report that real wages in many—but not all—science and engineering occupations have been flat or slow-growing, and unemployment as high or higher than in many comparably-skilled occupations." Teitelbaum also wrote that the then-current national fixation on increasing STEM participation paralleled previous U.S. government efforts since [[World War II]] to increase the number of scientists and engineers, all of which he stated ultimately ended up in "mass layoffs, hiring freezes, and funding cuts"; including one driven by the [[Space Race]] of the late 1950s and 1960s, which he wrote led to "a bust of serious magnitude in the 1970s."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Myth of the Science and Engineering Shortage |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/03/the-myth-of-the-science-and-engineering-shortage/284359/ |first=Michael S. |last=Teitelbaum |work=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[IEEE Spectrum]]'' contributing editor Robert N. Charette echoed these sentiments in the 2013 article "The STEM Crisis Is a Myth", also noting that there was a "mismatch between earning a STEM degree and having a STEM job" in the United States, with only around ¼ of STEM graduates working in STEM fields, while less than half of workers in STEM fields have a STEM degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The STEM Crisis Is a Myth |url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/at-work/education/the-stem-crisis-is-a-myth |first=Robert N. |last=Charette |publisher=IEEE Spectrum |date=August 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economics writer Ben Casselman, in a 2014 study of post-graduation earnings for ''[[FiveThirtyEight]]'', wrote that, based on the data, science should not be grouped with the other three STEM categories, because, while the other three generally result in high-paying jobs, "many sciences, particularly the [[life sciences]], pay below the overall median for recent college graduates."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Economic Guide To Picking A College Major |url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economic-guide-to-picking-a-college-major/ |first=Ben |last=Casselman |publisher=FiveThirtyEight |date=September 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Efforts to remedy the perceived domination of STEM subjects by men of Asian and non-Hispanic European backgrounds has led to intense efforts to diversify the STEM workforce. However, some critics feel that this practice in higher education, as opposed to a strict [[meritocracy]], causes lower academic standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Screening''' in [[economics]] refers to a strategy of combating [[adverse selection]], one of the potential decision-making complications in cases of [[asymmetric information]], by the agent(s) with less information. The concept of screening was first developed by [[Michael Spence]] (1973),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Spence | first1 = A. M. | year = 1973 | title = Job Market Signaling | journal = Quarterly Journal of Economics | volume = 87 | issue = 3 | pages = 355–374 | publisher =  | jstor = 1882010 | url =  | doi=10.2307/1882010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and should be distinguished from [[Signalling (economics)|signalling]], a strategy of combating adverse selection undertaken by the agent(s) with more information.

For purposes of screening, asymmetric information cases assume two [[Agent (economics)|economic agent]]s—which we call, for example, Abel and Cain—where Abel knows more about himself than Cain knows about Abel. The agents are attempting to engage in some sort of [[Database transaction|transaction]], often involving a long-term relationship, though that qualifier is not necessary. The "screener" (the one with less information, in this case, Cain) attempts to rectify this asymmetry by learning as much as he can about Abel.

The actual screening process depends on the nature of the scenario, but is usually closely connected with the future relationship.

In [[education economics]], screening models are commonly contrasted with [[human capital]] theory. In a screening model used to determine an applicant's ability to learn, giving preference to applicants who have earned academic degrees reduces the employer's risk of hiring someone with a diminished capacity for learning.

==Examples==
{{Refimprove|date=November 2016}}
*Second degree price discrimination is an example of screening whereby a seller offers a menu of options and the buyer's choice reveals his private information. For example, a business traveler that refuses a weekend stay over reveals to the airline that he is in fact a business traveler and therefore has a higher willingness to pay than a leisure traveler. As another example, a consumer with a high willingness to pay for quality may choose to purchase a more expensive computer with more hard drive space over a cheaper version with less hard drive space.
*An employer seeking a salesperson may offer a contract with a low base salary supplemented with a commission when sales are made. A potential employee who privately knows he is bad at sales will self-select away from this firm while a potential employee who privately knows he is good at sales would accept such a contract.

== Contract theory ==
In [[contract theory]], the terms "screening models" and "[[adverse selection]] models" are often used interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The theory of incentives: The principal-agent model|last = Laffont|first = Jean-Jacques|publisher = Princeton University Press|year = 2002|isbn = |location = |pages = |last2 = Martimort|first2 = David}}&lt;/ref&gt; An agent has private information about his type (e.g., his costs or his valuation of a good) ''before'' the principal makes a contract offer. The principal will then offer a ''menu'' of contracts in order to separate the different types. Typically, the best type will trade the same amount as in the first-best benchmark solution (which would be attained under complete information), a property known as "no distortion at the top". All other types typically trade less than in the first-best solution (i.e., there is a "downward distortion" of the trade level).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Game theory|last = Fudenberg|first = Drew|publisher = MIT Press|year = 1991|isbn = |location = |pages = |last2 = Tirole|first2 = Jean|at = Chapter 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Optimal auction design (more generally known as Bayesian mechanism design) can be seen as a multi-agent version of the basic screening model.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Optimal Auction Design|url = http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/moor.6.1.58|journal = Mathematics of Operations Research|date = 1981|issn = 0364-765X|pages = 58–73|volume = 6|issue = 1|doi = 10.1287/moor.6.1.58|first = Roger B.|last = Myerson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Simple Economics of Optimal Auctions|url = http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/261643|journal = Journal of Political Economy|volume = 97|issue = 5|doi = 10.1086/261643|first = Jeremy|last = Bulow|first2 = John|last2 = Roberts|date = 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contract-theoretic screening models have been pioneered by [[Roger Myerson]] and [[Eric Maskin]]. They have been extended in various directions, e.g. it has been shown that in the context of patent licensing optimal screening contracts may actually yield too much trade compared to the first-best solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = On Monopolistic Licensing Strategies under Asymmetric Information|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022053101928637|journal = Journal of Economic Theory|date = 2002|pages = 177–189|volume = 106|issue = 1|doi = 10.1006/jeth.2001.2863|first = Patrick W.|last = Schmitz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applications of screening models include regulation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Regulating a Monopolist with Unknown Costs|jstor = 1912769|journal = Econometrica|volume = 50|issue = 4|doi = 10.2307/1912769|first = David P.|last = Baron|first2 = Roger B.|last2 = Myerson|date = 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; public procurement,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A theory of incentives in procurement and regulation|last = Laffont|first = Jean-Jacques|publisher = MIT Press|year = 1993|isbn = |location = |pages = |last2 = Tirole|first2 = Jean}}&lt;/ref&gt; and monopolistic price discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Monopoly with incomplete information|last = Maskin|first = Eric|date = 1984|journal = RAND Journal of Economics|doi = |pmid = |last2 = Riley|first2 = John|pages = 171–196|volume = 15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contract-theoretic screening models have been successfully tested in laboratory experiments and using field data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Do sellers offer menus of contracts to separate buyer types?

'''SkELL''' is an abbreviation of [[Sketch Engine]] for Language Learning.&lt;ref name="raslan"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baisa|first1=Vít|last2=Suchomel|first2=Vít|title=SkELL:Web Interface for English Language Learning|journal=Eighth Workshop on Recent Advances in Slavonic Natural Language Processing|date=2014|pages=63–70|url=https://nlp.fi.muni.cz/raslan/raslan14.pdf#page=71|publisher=NLP Consulting}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a web interface for language learning. The main purpose is to help students and teachers of languages. SkELL has its own [[Text corpus|corpus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://eflnotes.wordpress.com/tag/james-thomas/ |title=Discovering English with SketchEngine – James Thomas interview |last=Thomas |first=James |publisher= |date=14 June 2015 |website=EFL NOTES |access-date=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was gathered so that contained texts covering everyday, standard, formal, and professional language.&lt;ref name="raslan"/&gt; In the corpus, there are a total of more than 60 million sentences and more than one billion words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sketchengine.co.uk/skell/ |title=SkELL |publisher=Lexical Computing Ltd. |date= |website=Sketch Engine |access-date=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SkELL interface provides features such as simple search showing words in context, but the maximum of displayed lines ([[Concordance (publishing)|concordances]], in fact) is 40. However, the frequency of searched query is located below the search box and expressed with the number ''hits per million''. The second function is [[word sketch]] which enables showing collocates for a given word or words. The last one is named as similar words. It visualises similar words to searched word in a [[word cloud]].

The tool has been available also for the Russian language (since 2015)&lt;ref&gt;Valentina, A., Vitalevna, B. O., Малолетняя, А. П., Olga, K., &amp; Vit, B. (2016).

== Features ==
SkELL offers three types of searches.

* Examples – searching for words and phrases and their all derived forms
* Word sketch – a simplified version of the original word sketch page
* Similar words – based on the Distributional [[thesaurus]] in Sketch Engine, there are not necessarily	synonyms



== Data ==
The corpus for English SkELL consists of [[English Wikipedia]] (special sorted out 130,000 articles), English collection of [[Project Gutenberg]], a subset from the web corpus enTenTen14,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jakubíček|first1=Miloš.|last2=Kilgarriff|first2=Adam|last3=Kovář|first3=Vojtěch|last4=Rychlý|first4=Pavel|last5=Suchomel|first5=Vít|title=The tenten corpus family|journal=Seventh International Corpus Linguistics Conference CL|date=July 2013|pages=125–127|url=|publisher=Lancaster University}}&lt;/ref&gt; the whole [[British National Corpus]], and free new sources.&lt;ref name="raslan"/&gt;

=== Processing the data ===
After gathering and pre-cleaning (all structures have removed except sentences) data has run through processing pipe: normalization, [[Tokenization (lexical analysis)|tokenization]], TreeTagger for English, and [[Data deduplication|deduplication]]. The further process was a compilation of the corpus using manatee indexing library. In the end, all sentences were scored with the GDEX&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kilgarriff|first1=A.|last2=Husák|first2=M.|last3=McAdam|first3=K.|last4=Rundell|first4=M.|last5=Rychlý|first5=P.|title=GDEX: Automatically finding good dictionary examples in a corpus|journal=Proceedings of the XIII EURALEX International Congress|date=July 2008|pages=425–432|url=http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=5040252|publisher=EURALEX}}&lt;/ref&gt; tool.&lt;ref name="raslan"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12247">The '''small schools movement''', also known as the '''Small Schools Initiative''', in the [[United States of America]] holds that many [[high school]]s are too large and should be reorganized into smaller, autonomous schools of no more than 400 students, and optimally under 200. Many private schools of under 200 share design features which draw upon the benefits of organizations of less than 200 people.  In the public school version of the Small Schools Movement, students may be given a choice of which small school they want to join. Each of the smaller schools would offer students a feeling of connectedness between students who share the same or similar interests with them. In many ways, the small schools in high schools would resemble the team system of many [[middle school]]s across the United States. Small schools allow students to have more individual attention from teachers than most average high schools.  Many small schools are created by reforming a failed large school into several small ones in the same building, as is the case with the former [[Theodore Roosevelt High School (New York City)|Theodore Roosevelt High School]] in the Bronx in New York City.

== Benefits ==
Supporters of small schools claim that "in small schools, student achievement increases... Student attendance improves, graduation rates rise, and college going rates increase. Students are more engaged in their studies and are more likely to participate in extracurricular activities." This is due to the fact that students are more likely to be known by all of the adults and children in the school and are much less likely to "fall through the cracks."

[[Deborah Meier]] has argued that a small school allows all of the teachers to sit around a single table and to create a culture of shared decision-making. This should be a central component of a school that intends to teach children to become powerful members of a democracy--they should see their teachers acting democratically. Face-to-face democracy is much more likely and practical in a small school.&lt;ref name="klonsky"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Power-Their-Ideas-Lessons-America/dp/0807031135/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1369321806&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+power+of+their+ideas |title=Deborah Meier: The Power of Their Ideas |publisher=Beacon Press |date= |accessdate=2013-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Democratic-Education-Practice-Mission-Practitioner/dp/0807753807/ref=sr_1_1_title_0_main?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1367896244&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=matthew+knoester |title=Democratic Education in Practice: Inside the Mission Hill School |publisher=Teachers College Press |date= |accessdate=2013-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Positive gains for student achievement within small schools can be seen in Oakland California. According to a study by the Annenberg Institute for School Reform at [[Brown University]] "small schools in Oakland are outperforming the large schools from which they emerged. In particular, students are completing more rigorous coursework and dropping out at lower rates, compared to the large schools." &lt;ref&gt;Shah, Sema; Kavitha Mediratta and Sara McAlister, [http://www.annenberginstitute.org/pdf/Mott_Oakland_high.pdf Building a Districtwide Small Schools Movement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626205035/http://www.annenberginstitute.org/pdf/Mott_Oakland_high.pdf |date=2010-06-26 }}, Annenberg Institute for School Reform at Brown University, April 2009, p.10&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''The American Dream and the Public Schools'' by Jennifer L. Hochschild and Nathan Scovronick, smaller classes sizes contribute to students in "early grades, and consistently challenging academic courses have been demonstrated to help disadvantaged
children achieve, just as they enable middle-class children to achieve." &lt;ref&gt;Hochschild, Jennifer L. and Nathan Scovronick. ''The American Dream and the Public School'', Oxford University Press, 2003. p.5 New York&lt;/ref&gt;

"Smaller, more intimate learning communities consistently deliver better results in academics and discipline when compared to their larger counterparts. Big schools offer few opportunities to participate."&lt;ref&gt;WashingtonPost, 8/15/02&lt;/ref&gt; "Students at large schools are more prone to be alienated from their peers or engage in risky behavior." &lt;ref&gt;University of Minnesota research, Los Angeles Times, 4/12/02&lt;/ref&gt;

Other benefits of small schools are noted in a study conducted by [[UCLA]] stating that "at their best, small schools are seen as enhancing strong personal bonds, home and community involvement, improved instructional quality and accountability, and improved teacher working conditions and job satisfaction."&lt;ref&gt;Center for Mental Health in Schools. (2009). Learning Supports and Small Schools. Los Angeles, CA: Author.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leading small schools proponent and founder of the Small Schools Coalition&lt;ref name="ssc"&gt;http://www.smallschoolscoalition.com&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Grauer School]] Dr. Stuart Grauer notes, "Research shows overwhelmingly that small schools lead to greater student academic gains and personal adjustment. In fact, data justifying this has been available for decades; it's just that policy makers have largely ignored it, no doubt due to the costs of such programs (and, of course, the politics). Right now, armed guards, metal detectors, and expulsions fail to get to the heart of the problem. (To a serious extent, they can actually create repressive conditions which make the problem worse.) Consequently, many people are looking for another way, and small schools can't be ignored much longer." Why do we keep building gigantic schools when we have such promising data? Dr. Grauer attributes this not only to economics, but to prevailing myths about American education: "Our collective memory of high school includes nostalgia such as proms, football games, exciting social lives, romance, and first cars. No matter that such memories do not apply to most students. The average high school student does not attend sporting events; indeed the larger the school, the smaller the percentage of student participation in these activities. For most students, the social scene in large high schools is tough and unforgiving, with sharp distinctions made between the small group of social haves and the far larger masses of have-nots. And high school memories seldom include a significant academic component, let alone an intellectual one ( 2001). In other words, many high schools have activities that everyone speaks of with pride—sacred cows like the marching band, the lacrosse team, the boosters. These untouchable activities represent the school's image, and they can't be changed, even though they serve a very small percentage of students and rarely have any connection to the most basic thing of all: the focus on student learning."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grauerschool.com/about/philosophy Grauer School]&lt;/ref&gt;

Small schools are gaining popularity in the United States not only with students, but with donors as well. According to the Neal Peirce Column of [[the Washington Post Writers Group]], "far and away the biggest catalyst is the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]]. It has poured over $1 billion in five years into promoting smaller schools in Boston, Chicago, Milwaukee and other cities. Just this month New York City announced it was coming on board the small schools movement. It will open 60 schools with 500 students or less -- 41 high schools, four traditional middle schools and 15 based on an innovative sixth- or seventh-through-12th grade model." &lt;ref&gt;Peirce, Neal. "COULD SMALLER SCHOOLS BE THE AMERICAN FUTURE?" The Washington Post Writers Group 21 March 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research and the growing data on small schools have provided some evidence regarding their better academic quality in comparison to their larger counterparts.&lt;ref name="klonsky"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-klonsky-phd/deborah-meier-small-schools_b_859362.html |title=Mike Klonsky: An Interview With Deborah Meier on the Small-Schools Movement |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= 2011-05-11|accessdate=2013-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Simple-Justice-Challenge-Schools-Teaching/dp/0807739626/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1369321089&amp;sr=1-2-fkmr0&amp;keywords=a+simple+justice+pedro+noguera+small+schools |title=A Simple Justice: The Challenge of Small Schools |publisher=Teachers College Press |date= |accessdate=2013-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dr. Sharif Shakrani, the co-director of the Education Policy Center at [[Michigan State University]], "Recent studies suggest students in small public high schools perform better academically, have higher attendance rates, feel safer, experience fewer behavior problems and participate more frequently in extracurricular activities." &lt;ref name="Shakrani"&gt;Shakrani, Sharif. [http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICDocs/data/ericdocs2sql/content_storage_01/0000019b/80/3e/61/2c.pdf "A Big Idea: Smaller High Schools."]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Education Policy Center, Michigan State University (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakrani also states that "a number of empirical articles document that students in small public and private high schools have higher achievement levels than those in large schools. Studies found higher student gains in reading, mathematics, science and social studies at small high schools than at large schools. Moreover, small schools are more likely to have fewer incidents of violence and misbehavior and that, in turn, has been found to contribute to higher attendance and lower drop-out and truancy rates." &lt;ref name="Shakrani" /&gt;

Small schools tend to emerge, particularly in urban areas, where there is a need for education reform due to failing school systems. High quality small public schools act as a remedy to large public schools that are falling behind in their ability to graduate students, achieve higher test scores and provide students with individual attention. The small school movement has modeled its efforts after small private schools which provide a similar learning environment which is based upon providing for the needs of their students.

== Criticisms ==
Many criticisms stem from the fact that the term "small school" is not uniform.  For instance, schools of between 400 and 1200 students are often researched as small schools despite having few of the attributes of small schools (e.g., a community of 200 or less, class size of less than 15, and similar criteria often applied).&lt;ref name="ssc"/&gt;
Hence, they point out that large schools tend to have a wider diversity of course offerings, as well as more clubs, arts programs, higher performing sports teams, and other extracurricular activities such as school newspapers and social events. Small schools advocates point out that in schools of less than 400 and especially less than 230, students have more access to enrichment and leadership programs. Some schools have abandoned the small school approach after failures to overcome these difficulties, even after being offered grants to continue these experiments. Other districts have expanded this movement by shutting down large schools and opening more smaller ones.&lt;ref&gt;Jehlen, Alain and Cynthia Kopkowski (February 2006) [http://www.nea.org/home/12214.htm "Is Smaller Better?"] ''NEA Today''.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Gates Foundation, which supports and funds small schools, is beginning to change its focus to working directly on improving instruction, giving grants to improve math and science instruction, for example.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Linda (November 5, 2006) [http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003348701_gates05m.html "Foundation's small-schools experiment has yet to yield big results."] ''Seattle Times.''&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11421">[[Image:Young Shatskii.JPG|thumb|Stanislav Shatskii]] 
'''Stanislav Shatskii''' (alternative spelling '''Shatsky''') (1878&amp;ndash;1934) was an important [[Humanistic education|humanistic educator]], writer, and educational administrator in the late [[Russian Empire]] and the early [[Soviet Union]].

Shatskii established a number of experimental and progressive educational institutions between 1905 and 1934. A member of the Russian [[intelligentsia]], Shatskii imported many of the values of late tsarist educational experimentation (many of which were based on the methods of American [[progressive education]]) into early Soviet approaches to creating a communist school and constructing 'a new Soviet person'.

His work as a communist educator complicates our understanding of communist education.  Shatskii, unlike those who would follow him, denied the primacy of politics and [[class struggle]] in the creation of a new communist man.  He also resisted indoctrinational techniques, instead preferring to demonstrate to pupils the relevance and importance of a reasoned approach to life.  For Shatskii, true communist education was the release of the individual from the strictures of the capitalist system.  The importance of his work is only recently being recognized as many of his publications were suppressed by Stalin and the Soviet educational orthodoxy that sought to ensure that all 'communist education' had a class-based element. He deserves a place in Russian pedagogy with [[Anton Makarenko]] and Lev [[Vygotsky]].

He sought to build a liberal, child-centered version of communist education that drew on [[John Dewey]]'s activity-based educational methods and [[Lev Tolstoi]]'s focus on an aesthetically based, free education.  Placing these ideas in a Marxist framework, Shatskii hoped that a communist education &amp;ndash; founded on the principles of cooperation and self-motivation &amp;ndash; would release the child's innate potential and help him develop into a well-rounded human being. His ideal student was a child that appreciated art, culture, and music, yet also knew the value of a hard day's work: "A child of high culture with callused hands".

==Imperial-era educational projects==
[[Image:Wiki Zelenko Kindergarten Vadkovsky Lane.jpg|thumb|150px|right|1907 Communal Club for working teenagers, funded by [[Nikolay Vtorov]], designed and managed by [[Alexander Zelenko]] and [[Stanislav Shatskii]]]]
His first major educational institution was The Settlement (Setlment) which was established in northern Moscow in 1905.  This complex of institutions drew its ideological inspiration from the [[settlement movement]].  Specifically modelled on the Chicago-based [[Hull House]], where Shatskii's collaborator, architect [[Alexander Zelenko]] had lived for a year, the Settlement was a complex of children's clubs and informal classes.  At the center of the Settlement was the Zelenko-designed ''Communal Club for working children'', opened in 1907 in Moscow's blue-collar North End (Vadkovsky Lane, 5) and funded by industrialist [[Nikolay Vtorov]]. The Club was a part of a larger drive to set up a cultural and social center in remote working class district of Moscow (Miusskaya Square project).

The first of its kind in the Imperial Russia, the loose arrangement of institutions in the Settlement attracted intellectuals and businessmen who shared Shatskii's view that education was a non-violent path to healing the sores of a divided tsarist society. Due to police suspicion of seditious teaching and charges of [[communism]], the Settlement was closed down by police in May, 1908 (Zelenko ended up in jail for a few months). Later, Shatskii established a rural summer colony called The Invigorating Life (Бодрая жизнь, Bodraia zhizn') in rural Kaluga region (near [[Obninsk]]), in which he stressed labor-based methods of education, creativity, and artistic expression.

==Soviet-era experimentation: The First Experimental Station==

[[Image:Joy of learning.JPG|thumb|The Joy of Learning at the First Experimental Station]]

After the 1917 [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], Shatskii's initial opposition to Soviet power faded as Soviet authorities adopted many of values and ideas of [[educational progressivism]] into their educational approach (see Declaration on the United Labor School in W. Rosenburg, Bolshevik Visions: First Phase of the Cultural Revolution, 1984). In 1919, he set up the First Experimental Station (Pervaia Opytnaia Stantsiia), which was a massive network of experimental institutions.   Divided into [[Moscow]] and Kaluga sections,  this organization was vast, employing hundreds of teachers, incorporating village and city schools, libraries, children's clubs, reading huts, and demanding a large amount of resources from the government.  This school complex would become the envy of international progressive educators and represented the largest, most radical experimental educational institution in the world.  As Stalin sought to impose ideological control over the Soviet state, the First Experimental Station was reorganized by Soviet authorities in 1932 and Shatskii was removed from his position.  Shatskii died of natural causes in 1934.

== Educational leadership ==
Shatskii also became an important educational leader in the [[Soviet Union]], developing programs for schools across Soviet Russia in his capacity as one of the leaders of the pedagogical section of the State Academic Council (''Glavny Uchyony Sovet'').  His meteoric rise to power suggested the importance of the Russian educational [[intelligentsia]] to early Soviet governance.  Shatskii eventually joined the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] in 1928, but [[Joseph Stalin]]'s '[[Great Break (USSR)|Great Break]]' of 1928 removed Shatskii and other like-minded intellectuals from positions of power within the educational apparatus.  Shatskii's First Experimental Station would be closed down by Soviet power in 1932 as part of the Stalinist shift to a more ideological approach to education.  Shatskii himself died 30 October 1934, as rumors circulated that he was going to be sent to the [[gulag]].

==Shatskii's legacy==

Most of Shatskii's work was suppressed by Stalinist officials as the progressive approach of the Soviet Union in the 1920s was redrawn as heretical and bourgeois, but his emphasis on activity and the joy of learning could be found in later Soviet pedagogues, including [[Sukhomlinsky]].  Currently, many of Shatskii's ideas are being rehabilitated in Russia (most notably, Feliks Fradkin and Gennadii Malinin have published books and articles on Shatskii's hidden legacy - see below). Furthermore, an annual conference in Obninsk, Russia (not far from Shatskii's Kaluga-based schools of the First Experimental Station) is convened in his honor.  Finally, in the west, Shatskii has been the subject of recent articles in the [[Slavonic and East European Review]] (October, 2004), the Journal of the Oxford University History Society (2005), and the History of Education  (see below)

==Ideological influences==

Shatskii drew a great deal on American [[Educational progressivism]], particularly [[John Dewey]].  During the Soviet period, Shatskii would be influenced by [[Marxism]], blending his own liberational, progressive educational ideas with Marx's materialist approach.

== History ==
In late 2006 political scientist [[Kerstin Schnatz]] and cinematographer [[Isabel Huber]] began to research on uranium. They intended to do a documentary film focussing on the origins of nuclear power, especially the [[nuclear cycle]] and [[uranium mining]]. After having gathered a film crew of volunteers, the film was shot in Australia, France and Germany. In 2009 the international version of the documentary "Uranium - is it a country?" (53 min.) was released and nominated for the newcomer's award "Goldener Schlüssel" at [[Kasseler Dokumentarfilm- und Videofest]] in Germany.&lt;ref name="Dok-Fest Kassel 2009"&gt;

to spread the content. The film has been screened thousands of times all around the world due to its [[decentralised]] [[Film distributor|distribution]] coordinated by online networking activists.
It has been used heavily for political campaigning up to the [[German federal election]] in September 2009&lt;ref name="Screening Ludwigsburg"&gt;

In the summer of 2010 the film crew decided to found a [[non-profit organisation]] (Strahlendes Klima e.V.) to keep up the work on envirenmental issues.

== Activities ==

Strahlendes Klima e.V. helps activists to organize film screenings and debates on environmental issues.
They organise workshops for schools and non-profits and release educational films and media on a regular basis. In 2010 "At Eyelevel" their film about [[indigenous peoples]] facing the problems of uranium mining was released.

In 2011 [[Goethe Institut]]-Shanghai invited the organisation to visit [[China]]. A short film treating [[renewable energies]] in China is expected to be released in mid-2012.&lt;ref name="Projekt China"&gt;
                      {{cite web
                      | url     = http://china.strahlendesklima.de

                      }}&lt;/ref&gt;
They recently started the shooting of a new feature-length documentary on sustainable waste strategies, which will be available licensed under [[creative commons]] by 2013.

A '''strength and conditioning coach''' is a [[physical fitness|fitness]] and physical performance professional who uses [[exercise prescription]] specifically, but not limited, to improve the performance of competitive athletes.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eis2win.co.uk/expertise/strength-conditioning/|title=Strength &amp; Conditioning - English Institute of Sport|work=English Institute of Sport|access-date=16 May 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is achieved through the combination of [[strength training]] and [[aerobic conditioning]], alongside a variety of further methods. Strength and conditioning coaches also help athletes with injury prevention and proper mechanics within their sports performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Strength and conditioning coach|url=http://www.humankinetics.com/excerpts/excerpts/strength-and-conditioning-coach|publisher=Human Kinetics|access-date=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Employment characteristics ==
[[File:Australian Opals in the AIS Strength and Conditioning Gym during day three of the Opals camp.jpg|thumb|A strength and conditioning gym]]
Strength and conditioning coaches may work with sports teams, as well as individuals. Strength and conditioning coaches are often employed by [[higher education]] institutions and professional athletic teams.

Strength and conditioning coaches have the option to specialize in a particular sports team, type of performance, training type, training philosophy, or work in the collegiate level, where they are assigned a sport. The general description and duty of a strength and conditioning coach is to develop an exercise prescription plan that modulates aerobic, resistance, and/or flexibility training to suit the metabolic and physical demands of the sport in question.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  With [[aerobic exercise]] prescription, strength and conditioning coaches determine the type, duration, and frequency of each exercise.  For [[resistance exercise]] prescription, the type of exercise, total session volume, rest period, frequency, and intensity are determined.&lt;ref&gt;Kraemer, WJ. Exercise Physiology: Integrating Theory and Application.  Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins. Chapter 12.  Ahead of print, March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; They may also be involved in prescription of [[stretching]] routines or other approaches.  [[Nutrition]] and medical consultation are not within their scope of practice and training qualifications.

== Qualification standards ==

=== United States ===
In the US, The National Strength and Conditioning Association offers a Certified Strength and Conditioning Coach qualification that is required for positions in the field.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} In addition to the C.S.C.S. certification, it is encouraged to attain a bachelor's degree in majors that are related to exercise science due to the competitiveness of the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsca.com/education/articles/career-series/becoming-a-strength-and-conditioning-coach/|title=Becoming a Strength and Conditioning Coach|access-date=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Collegiate Strength &amp; Conditioning Coaches association also offers certification exclusive to the collegiate and professional-level strength and conditioning coach. This certification is known as Strength &amp; Conditioning Coach Certified (SCCC) and requires a bachelor's degree and a 640-hour internship in addition to passing the certification exam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cscca.org/about|title=About Us|author=|date=|website=CSCCA.org|access-date=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
Strength and conditioning in the UK is generally overseen by the UK Strength and Conditioning Association (UKSCA) and the Register of Exercise Professionals (REPS). Both organisations provide regulations and standards for employers and professionals. A UKSCA membership and Bachelor's degree in sport and exercise science are generally accepted by many professional sports clubs as prerequisites for strength and conditioning positions. As well as the UKSCA and REPS, 1st4sport Qualifications offer standardised training in accordance with other official National Governing Body qualifications.

== Effectiveness ==
The implementation of effective strength and conditioning programmes has led to an increase in speed and strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Changes in Body Size and Physical Characteristics of South A... : The Journal of Strength &amp; Conditioning Research|url=http://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Abstract/2015/04000/Changes_in_Body_Size_and_Physical_Characteristics.17.aspx|journal=LWW|language=en-US|doi=10.1519/JSC.0000000000000724}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Izquierdo|first=Mikel|last2=Häkkinen|first2=Keijo|last3=Gonzalez-Badillo|first3=Juan J.|last4=Ibáñez|first4=Javier|last5=Gorostiaga|first5=Esteban M.|date=1 July 2002|title=Effects of long-term training specificity on maximal strength and power of the upper and lower extremities in athletes from different sports|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00421-002-0628-y|journal=European Journal of Applied Physiology|language=en|volume=87|issue=3|pages=264–271|doi=10.1007/s00421-002-0628-y|issn=1439-6319}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karsten|first=Bettina|last2=Stevens|first2=Liesbeth|last3=Colpus|first3=Mark|last4=Larumbe-Zabala|first4=Eneko|last5=Naclerio|first5=Fernando|date=2016-01-01|title=The Effects of a Sport-Specific Maximal Strength and Conditioning Training on Critical Velocity, Anaerobic Running Distance, and 5-km Race Performance|journal=International Journal of Sports Physiology and Performance|volume=11|issue=1|pages=80–85|doi=10.1123/ijspp.2014-0559|issn=1555-0273|pmid=25946163}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has demonstrated that not only does training improve performance but incorrect training (distance running, a [[slow-twitch muscle]] fiber activity, in football athletes with fast-twitch characteristics) can cause decrements to performance. Using techniques such as [[plyometrics]] in some high-power athletes and sports-specific movements in others, strength coaches may improve physical function and athletic performance.&lt;ref&gt;Kraemer, WJ. ''Exercise Physiology: Integrating Theory and Application''. Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins. Ahead of print, March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Criticism has followed the increased use of strength and conditioning coaches in a variety of sports due to the shift in importance to the size and speed of the players. In [[rugby union]], a game with heavy physical contact and minimal{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=June 2017}} protection, players are being described as being "too big", creating collisions that are increasing the risk of short and long term injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-34290980|title=How big will rugby players get?|last=Rhodes|first=David|date=19 September 2015|work=BBC News|access-date=16 May 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, it has been proposed that the increased weight and speed of players and subsequent rise of collision [[force]] leads to more frequent and severe [[Concussion|concussion injuries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/premiership/11407436/Rugby-concussions-soar-by-59-per-cent-says-report.html|title=Rugby concussions soar by 59 per cent, says report|first=Daniel|last=Schofield|date=11 February 2015|work=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=16 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/27655550|title=Rugby's concussion issue under the spotlight|first=Tom|last=English|date=1 June 2014|work=BBC Sport|access-date=16 May 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there is as yet no research to suggest an increased use of strength and conditioning leading to an increased risk of injury.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

==Company history==

===Inception===
The company was initially founded in 2011 as [https://www.student.com/en-gb/about Overseas Student Living] by Luke Nolan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://startups.co.uk/accommodation-booking-platform-student-com-clinches-60m/ | title=Accommodation booking platform Student.com clinches $60m | publisher=Startups.co.uk | accessdate=26 February 2016 | author=Henry Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailynewsx.com/news/technology-news/accommodation-marketplace-student-com-has-raised-60-million-22173.html | title=Accommodation marketplace Student.com has raised $60 million | publisher=Dailynewsx | accessdate=26 February 2016 | author=Daniel McDonald}}&lt;/ref&gt; After working in [[China]] for several years, Nolan was regularly called upon by his Chinese friends to help recommend accommodation for students looking to study in the US, UK and Australia. Recognizing that many other individuals, especially students, were facing similar issues, Nolan realized that there was a potential market for an online student accommodation marketplace that could help in connecting students with trusted professional landlords for their accommodation needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dealstreetasia.com/stories/30375-30375/ | title=Student.com secures $60m investment in round led by VY Capital | publisher=Dealstreetasia | accessdate=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.emea.gr/60-%CE%B5%CE%BA%CE%B1%CF%84.-%CE%B4%CE%BF%CE%BB.-%CE%B3%CE%B9%CE%B1-%CF%84%CE%BF-student.com-%CE%AD%CE%BD%CE%B1-marketplace-%CE%B5%CF%8D%CF%81%CE%B5%CF%83%CE%B7%CF%82-%CF%86%CE%BF%CE%B9%CF%84/473203 | title=60 εκατ. δολ. για το Student.com, ένα marketplace εύρεσης φοιτητικής στέγης | publisher=Emea.gr | accessdate=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, he was joined by other co-founders Shakil Khan, who met Nolan 10-years earlier in Shanghai, and John-Paul Jones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://thepienews.com/news/student-com-raises-60m-to-build-global-accommodation-reach/ | title=Student.com raises $60m to build global accommodation reach | accessdate=26 February 2016 | author=Natalie Marsh}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.itespresso.fr/student-com-leve-60-millions-dollars-net-economie-121331.html | title=Student.com lève 60 millions de dollars : merci la Net-économie | accessdate=26 February 2016 | author=Clément Bohic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company rebranded itself as Student.com in 2015 to focus on expanding globally and hired a team of multilingual booking agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://venturebeat.com/2016/02/10/student-com-raises-60m-and-its-profile-to-help-international-students-find-somewhere-to-live/ | title=Student.com raises $60M (and its profile) to help international students find somewhere to live | publisher=[[VentureBeat]] | accessdate=26 February 2016 | author=Paul Sawers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://e27.co/xiaomis-vp-spotifys-founders-join-us60m-investment-student-com-20160211/ | title=Xiaomi VP, Spotify Founders join US$60M investment in Student.com | accessdate=26 February 2016 | author=Yon Heong Tung}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://roll.sohu.com/20160215/n437409563.shtml | title=李嘉诚等投资Student.com 涉资4.7亿元 | publisher=[[Sohu.com]] | accessdate=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''theory of multiple intelligences''' differentiates [[human intelligence]] into specific 'modalities', rather than seeing intelligence as dominated by a single [[general ability]]. [[Howard Gardner]] proposed this model in his 1983 book ''Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences''. According to the theory, an intelligence 'modality' must fulfill eight criteria:{{r|Gilman}}
# potential for brain isolation by [[brain damage]],
# place in [[evolutionary history]],
# presence of core operations,
# susceptibility to encoding ([[symbolic expression]]),
# a distinct developmental progression,
# the existence of [[savant syndrome|savant]]s, prodigies and other exceptional people,
# support from [[experimental psychology]], and
# support from [[psychometric]] findings.

Gardner proposed seven abilities that he held to meet these criteria:&lt;ref&gt;Slavin, Robert (2009), ''Educational Psychology'', p. 117, {{ISBN|0-205-59200-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# musical-rhythmic,
# [[Spatial intelligence (psychology)|visual-spatial]],
# [[linguistic intelligence|verbal-linguistic]],
# logical-mathematical,
# bodily-kinesthetic,
# interpersonal,
# intrapersonal
He later suggested that [[Spiritual intelligence|existential]] and [[ethics|moral]] intelligences may also be worthy of inclusion.{{r|Smith}}

Although the distinction between intelligences has been set out in great detail, Gardner opposes the idea of labeling learners to a specific intelligence. Gardner maintains that his theory should "empower learners", not restrict them to one modality of learning.&lt;ref&gt;McKenzie, W. (2005). Multiple intelligences and instructional technology. ISTE (International Society for Technology Education). {{ISBN|156484188X}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gardner, an intelligence is "a biopsychological potential to process information that can be activated in a cultural setting to solve problems or create products that are of value in a culture."{{sfn|Gardner|1999|p=33-4|ps=}} According to a 2006 study, each of the domains proposed by Gardner involves a blend of the general [[g factor (psychometrics)|''g'' factor]], cognitive abilities other than ''g'', and, in some cases, non-cognitive abilities or personality characteristics.{{r|Response}}

== Intelligence modalities ==

=== Musical-rhythmic and harmonic ===
{{main|Musicality}}

This area has to do with sensitivity to sounds, rhythms, [[Pitch (music)|tones]], and music. People with a high musical intelligence normally have good pitch and may even have [[absolute pitch]], and are able to sing, play musical instruments, and compose music. They have sensitivity to rhythm, pitch, meter, tone, melody or timbre.{{r|PBS}}&lt;ref name=G-H&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gardner, H., &amp; Hatch, T. |title=Multiple intelligences go to school: Educational implications of the theory of multiple intelligences|doi=10.3102/0013189X018008004|url=https://www.sfu.ca/~jcnesbit/EDUC220/ThinkPaper/Gardner1989.pdf|year=1989|journal=Educational Researcher|volume=18|issue=8|page=4|last2=Hatch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Visual-spatial ===
{{main|Spatial intelligence (psychology)}}

This area deals with spatial judgment and the ability to visualize with the mind's eye. Spatial ability is one of the three factors beneath ''g'' in the hierarchical model of intelligence.&lt;ref name=G-H /&gt;

=== Verbal-linguistic ===
{{main|Linguistic intelligence}}

People with high verbal-linguistic intelligence display a facility with words and languages. They are typically good at reading, writing, telling stories and memorizing words along with dates.&lt;ref name=G-H /&gt; Verbal ability is one of the most ''g''-loaded abilities.&lt;ref&gt;Wechsler, D. (1997). [[Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale]] III.&lt;/ref&gt;
This type of intelligence is measured with the [[Verbal IQ|Verbal IQ in WAIS-IV]].

=== Logical-mathematical ===
{{further|Reason}}

This area has to do with [[logic]], abstractions, reasoning, numbers and critical thinking.&lt;ref name=G-H /&gt; This also has to do with having the capacity to understand the underlying principles of some kind of causal system.{{r|PBS}} Logical reasoning is closely linked to [[fluid intelligence]] and to [[g factor (psychometrics)|general intelligence (''g'' factor)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carroll |first=J. B. |title=Human Cognitive Abilities: A Survey of Factor-analytic Studies |year=1993 |publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521382755}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bodily-kinesthetic ===
{{further|Gross motor skill|Fine motor skill}}

The core elements of the bodily-[[Proprioception|kinesthetic]] intelligence are control of one's bodily motions and the capacity to handle objects skillfully.&lt;ref name=G-H /&gt; Gardner elaborates to say that this also includes a sense of timing, a clear sense of the goal of a physical action, along with the ability to train responses.

People who have high bodily-kinesthetic intelligence should be generally good at physical activities such as sports, dance, acting, and making things.

Gardner believes that careers that suit those with high bodily-kinesthetic intelligence include: [[athlete]]s, [[dancer]]s, [[musician]]s, [[actor]]s, [[General contractor|builders]], [[police officer]]s, and [[soldier]]s. Although these careers can be duplicated through virtual simulation, they will not produce the actual physical learning that is needed in this intelligence.{{r|Heteroglossia}}

=== Interpersonal ===
{{main|Social skills}}

In theory, individuals who have high interpersonal intelligence are characterized by their sensitivity to others' moods, feelings, temperaments, motivations, and their ability to cooperate in order to work as part of a group. According to Gardner in ''How Are Kids Smart: Multiple Intelligences in the Classroom'', "Inter- and Intra- personal intelligence is often misunderstood with being extroverted or liking other people..."&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, H. (1995). ''How Are Kids Smart: Multiple Intelligences in the Classroom—Administrators' Version''. {{ISBN|1-887943-03-X}}. National Professional Resources Dr. Howard Gardner, along with teachers and students from Fuller Elementary School in Gloucester, MA, discuss the theory behind Multiple Intelligences and demonstrate how they have integrated it into their classrooms and community. (41 minutes)&lt;/ref&gt; Those with high interpersonal intelligence communicate effectively and empathize easily with others, and may be either leaders or followers. They often enjoy discussion and debate." Gardner has equated this with [[emotional intelligence]] of Goleman.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, H. (2015). [https://soundcloud.com/bridging-the-gaps Bridging the Gaps: A Portal for Curious MindsPro Unlimited]. (at 17 minutes). soundcloud.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Gardner believes that careers that suit those with high interpersonal intelligence include [[sales persons]], [[politician]]s, managers, [[teacher]]s, [[lecturer]]s, [[Psychology|counselors]] and [[social worker]]s.{{r|Gardner2002}}

=== Intrapersonal ===
{{further|Introspection}}

This area has to do with introspective and self-reflective capacities. This refers to having a deep understanding of the self; what one's strengths or weaknesses are, what makes one unique, being able to predict one's own reactions or emotions.

=== Naturalistic ===
Not part of Gardner's original seven, naturalistic intelligence was proposed by him in 1995. "If I were to rewrite Frames of Mind today, I would probably add an eighth intelligence – the intelligence of the naturalist. It seems to me that the individual who is readily able to recognize flora and fauna, to make other consequential distinctions in the natural world, and to use this ability productively (in hunting, in farming, in biological science) is exercising an important intelligence and one that is not adequately encompassed in the current list."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gardner, H. |year=1995|title=Reflections on multiple intelligences: Myths and messages|journal=Phi Delta Kappan|volume= 77|pages= 200–209|url=https://learnweb.harvard.edu/WIDE/courses/files/Reflections.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This area has to do with nurturing and relating information to one's natural surroundings.&lt;ref name=G-H /&gt; Examples include classifying natural forms such as animal and plant species and rocks and mountain types. This ability was clearly of value in our evolutionary past as [[Hunter-gatherer|hunters, gatherers]], and [[farmer]]s; it continues to be central in such roles as [[botanist]] or [[chef]].{{r|PBS}}

This sort of ecological receptiveness is deeply rooted in a "sensitive, [[Ethics|ethical]], and [[Holism|holistic]] understanding" of the world and its complexities – including the role of humanity within the greater ecosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = Morris, M.|editor = Kincheloe, Joe L.|chapter = Ch. 8. The Eight One: Naturalistic Intelligence|title = Multiple Intelligences Reconsidered|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xVu3bhfSicIC&amp;pg=PR150|year = 2004|publisher = Peter Lang|isbn = 978-0-8204-7098-6|pages = 159–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Existential ===
{{main|Spiritual intelligence}}

Gardner did not want to commit to a spiritual intelligence, but suggested that an "existential" intelligence may be a useful construct, also proposed after the original 7 in his 1999 book.{{sfn|Gardner|1999|p=|ps=}} The hypothesis of an existential intelligence has been further explored by educational researchers.{{r|Tupper}}

=== Additional intelligences ===
On January 13, 2016, Gardner mentioned in an interview with [[Big Think|BigThink]] that he is considering adding the teaching-pedagogical intelligence "which allows us to be able to teach successfully to other people".&lt;ref name="Gard16"&gt;Gardner, Howard. (2016). Intelligence Isn't black and white: There are 8 different kinds. Bigthing. come. [http://bigthink.com/videos/howard-gardner-on-the-eight-intelligences video]. Check minutes 5:00 – 5:55 and 8:16&lt;/ref&gt; In the same interview, he explicitly refused some other suggested intelligences like humour, cooking and sexual intelligence.&lt;ref name="Gard16"/&gt;

== Critical reception ==
Gardner argues that there is a wide range of [[Cognition|cognitive abilities]], but that there are only very weak correlations among them. For example, the theory postulates that a child who learns to multiply easily is not necessarily more intelligent than a child who has more difficulty on this task. The child who takes more time to master multiplication may best learn to multiply through a different approach, may excel in a field outside mathematics, or may be looking at and understanding the multiplication process at a fundamentally deeper level.

[[Intelligence test]]s and [[psychometrics]] have generally found high correlations between different aspects of intelligence, rather than the low correlations which Gardner's theory predicts, supporting the prevailing theory of [[g factor (psychometrics)|general intelligence]] rather than multiple intelligences (MI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Geake|first1 = John|title = Neuromythologies in education|journal = Educational Research|year = 2008|volume = 50|issue = 2|pages = 123–133|doi = 10.1080/00131880802082518}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory has been criticized by mainstream psychology for its lack of [[empirical evidence]], and its dependence on subjective judgement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Waterhouse|first1 = Lynn|title = WATERHOUSE MULTIPLE INTELLIGENCES Multiple Intelligences, the Mozart Effect, and Emotional Intelligence: A Critical Review|journal = Educational Psychologist|year = 2006|volume = 41|issue = 4|pages = 207–225|url = http://www.faculty.mun.ca/cmattatall/Multiple_Intelligences_.pdf|doi = 10.1207/s15326985ep4104_1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However research by Dweck (2006),&lt;ref&gt;Dweck, C. S. (2006). Mindset: The new psychology of success. Random House Incorporated.&lt;/ref&gt; referred to as [[growth mindset|Growth Mindset Theory]], shows that individuals with low correlations can attain also high correlations through intelligence growth. This challenges the notion of fixed or static intelligence levels that general intelligence tests measure. More importantly, it challenges the notion that intelligence test scores are an accurate predictor for future ability.

=== Definition of intelligence ===
One major criticism of the theory is that it is ''[[ad hoc]]'': that Gardner is not expanding the definition of the word "intelligence", but rather denies the existence of [[intelligence]] as traditionally understood, and instead uses the word "intelligence" where other people have traditionally used words like "ability" and "[[aptitude]]". This practice has been criticized by [[Robert J. Sternberg]],{{r|Sternberg1983}}{{r|Sternberg1991}} [[Michael Eysenck|Eysenck]],{{sfn|Eysenck|1994|p=|ps=}} and Scarr.{{r|Scarr}} White (2006) points out that Gardner's selection and application of criteria for his "intelligences" is subjective and arbitrary, and that a different researcher would likely have come up with different criteria.{{sfn|Davis|Christodoulou|Seider|Gardner|2011|p=489|ps=}}

Defenders of MI theory argue that the traditional definition of intelligence is too narrow, and thus a broader definition more accurately reflects the differing ways in which humans think and learn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Nikolova, K., &amp; Taneva-Shopova, S.|year = 2007|title = Multiple intelligences theory and educational practice|publisher = Annual Assesn Zlatarov University|volume = 26|issue = 2|pages = 105–109|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264892931}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some criticisms arise from the fact that Gardner has not provided a test of his multiple intelligences. He originally defined it as the ability to solve problems that have value in at least one culture, or as something that a student is interested in. He then added a [[disclaimer]] that he has no fixed definition, and his classification is more of an artistic judgment than fact:

{{quote|Ultimately, it would certainly be desirable to have an [[algorithm]] for the selection of an intelligence, such that any [[Researcher|trained researcher]] could determine whether a candidate's intelligence met the appropriate criteria. At present, however, it must be admitted that the selection (or rejection) of a candidate's intelligence is reminiscent more of an [[Aesthetics|artistic judgment]] than of a scientific assessment.{{sfn|Gardner|1983|p=|ps=}}}}

Generally, linguistic and logical-mathematical abilities are called intelligences, but artistic, musical, athletic, etc. abilities are not. Gardner argues this causes the former to be needlessly aggrandized. Certain critics are wary of this widening of the definition, saying that it ignores "the connotation of intelligence&amp;nbsp;... [which] has always connoted the kind of thinking skills that makes one successful in school."{{r|Willingham}}

Gardner writes "I balk at the unwarranted assumption that certain human abilities can be arbitrarily singled out as intelligence while others cannot."{{r|Gardner1998}} Critics hold that given this statement, any interest or ability can be redefined as "intelligence". Thus, studying intelligence becomes difficult, because it diffuses into the broader concept of ability or talent. Gardner's addition of the naturalistic intelligence and conceptions of the existential and moral intelligences are seen as the fruits of this diffusion. Defenders of the MI theory would argue that this is simply a recognition of the broad scope of inherent mental abilities, and that such an exhaustive scope by nature defies a one-dimensional classification such as an [[Intelligence quotient|IQ value]].

The theory and definitions have been critiqued by Perry D. Klein as being so unclear as to be [[tautology (logic)|tautologous]] and thus [[falsifiability|unfalsifiable]]. Having a high musical ability means being good at music while at the same time being good at music is explained by having a high musical ability.{{r|Klein}}

[[Henri Wallon (psychologist)|Henri Wallon]] shows that « We can not distinguish intelligence from its operations »&lt;ref&gt;According to formulation of Émile Jalley for Henri Wallon in ''Principes de psychologie appliquée'' (Œuvre 1, édition L'Harmattan, 2015) : « On ne saurait distinguer l'intelligence de ses opérations »&lt;/ref&gt;. Yves Richez discovers 10 Natural Operating Modes (Modes Opératoire Naturel - MoON)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Richez |first=Yves |year=2018 |title=corporate talent detection and development|publisher=Wiley Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The Richez's studies show a gap between Chinese thought and Western thought. In China, notion of « Being » (Self) and notion of « intelligence » don't exist. Those are greek-Latin inventions (Platon). Instead of intelligence, Chinese speaks of « operating modes ». Thus, Yves Richez doesn't talk of « intelligence » but of « natural operating modes » (Mo.O.N.).

=== Neo-Piagetian criticism ===
[[Andreas Demetriou]] suggests that theories which overemphasize the autonomy of the domains are as simplistic as the theories that overemphasize the role of general intelligence and ignore the domains. He agrees with Gardner that there are indeed domains of intelligence that are relevantly autonomous of each other.{{r|Demetriou2011}} Some of the domains, such as verbal, spatial, mathematical, and [[social intelligence]] are identified by most lines of research in psychology. In Demetriou's theory, one of the [[neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development]], Gardner is criticized for underestimating the effects exerted on the various domains of intelligences by the various subprocesses that define overall processing efficiency, such as [[speed of processing]], [[executive functions]], [[working memory]], and [[metacognition|meta-cognitive processes]] underlying [[self-awareness]] and [[Self control|self-regulation]]. All of these processes are integral components of general intelligence that regulate the functioning and development of different domains of intelligence.{{sfn|Demetriou|Raftopoulos|2005|p=68|ps=}}

The domains are to a large extent expressions of the condition of the general processes, and may vary because of their constitutional differences but also differences in individual preferences and inclinations. Their functioning both channels and influences the operation of the general processes.{{r|Architecture}}{{r|Efficiency}} Thus, one cannot satisfactorily specify the intelligence of an individual or design effective intervention programs unless both the general processes and the domains of interest are evaluated.{{r|Self-awareness}}{{sfn|Demetriou|Mouyi|Spanoudis|2010|pp=|ps=}}

=== Human adaptation to multiple environments ===
The premise of the multiple intelligences hypothesis, that human intelligence is a collection of specialist abilities, have been criticized for not being able to explain human adaptation to most if not all environments in the world. In this context, humans are contrasted to [[social insect]]s that indeed have a distributed "intelligence" of specialists, and such insects may spread to climates resembling that of their origin but the same species never adapt to a wide range of climates from tropical to temperate by building different types of nests and learning what is edible and what is poisonous. While some such as the [[leafcutter ant]] grow fungi on leaves, they do not cultivate different species in different environments with different farming techniques as human [[agriculture]] does. It is therefore argued that human adaptability stems from a general ability to [[falsifiability|falsify hypotheses]] and make more generally accurate predictions and adapt behavior thereafter, and not a set of specialized abilities which would only work under specific environmental conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Mithen 2005 edition|"Creativity in Human Evolution and Prehistory"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rolf W. Frohlich 2009 edition|"Evolutionary Intelligence: The Anatomy of Human Survival"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== IQ tests ===
Gardner argues that IQ tests only measure linguistic and logical-mathematical abilities. He argues the importance of assessing in an "intelligence-fair" manner. While traditional paper-and-pen examinations favor linguistic and logical skills, there is a need for intelligence-fair measures that value the distinct modalities of thinking and learning that uniquely define each intelligence.&lt;ref name=G-H/&gt;

Psychologist [[Alan S. Kaufman]] points out that IQ tests have measured spatial abilities for 70 years.{{sfn|Kaufman|2009|p=|ps=}} Modern IQ tests are greatly influenced by the [[Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory]] which incorporates a general intelligence but also many more narrow abilities. While IQ tests do give an overall IQ score, they now also give scores for many more narrow abilities.{{sfn|Kaufman|2009|p=|ps=}}

=== Lack of empirical evidence ===
According to a 2006 study many of Gardner's "intelligences" correlate with the [[g factor (psychometrics)|''g'' factor]], supporting the idea of a single dominant type of intelligence. According to the study, each of the domains proposed by Gardner involved a blend of ''g'', of cognitive abilities other than ''g'', and, in some cases, of non-cognitive abilities or of personality characteristics.{{r|Response}}

[[Linda Gottfredson]] (2006) has argued that thousands of studies support the importance of [[intelligence quotient]] (IQ) in predicting school and job performance, and numerous other life outcomes. In contrast, empirical support for non-''g'' intelligences is either lacking or very poor. She argued that despite this the ideas of multiple non-''g'' intelligences are very attractive to many due to the suggestion that everyone can be smart in some way.{{r|Gottfredson2006}}

A critical review of MI theory argues that there is little empirical evidence to support it:
{{quote|To date, there have been no published studies that offer evidence of the validity of the multiple intelligences. In 1994 Sternberg reported finding no empirical studies. In 2000 Allix reported finding no [[empirical]] validating studies, and at that time Gardner and Connell conceded that there was "little hard evidence for MI theory" (2000, p. 292). In 2004 Sternberg and Grigerenko stated that there were no validating studies for multiple intelligences, and in 2004 Gardner asserted that he would be "delighted were such evidence to accrue",{{sfn|Gardner|2004|p=214|ps=}} and admitted that "MI theory has few enthusiasts among psychometricians or others of a traditional psychological background" because they require "psychometric or experimental evidence that allows one to prove the existence of the several intelligences."{{sfn|Gardner|2004|p=214|ps=}}{{r|Waterhouse2006}}}}

The same review presents evidence to demonstrate that [[cognitive neuroscience]] research does not support the theory of multiple intelligences:
{{quote|... the human brain is unlikely to function via Gardner's multiple intelligences. Taken together the evidence for the intercorrelations of subskills of IQ measures, the evidence for a shared set of genes associated with mathematics, reading, and g, and the evidence for shared and overlapping "what is it?" and "where is it?" neural processing pathways, and shared neural pathways for language, music, motor skills, and emotions suggest that it is unlikely that each of Gardner's intelligences could operate "via a different set of neural mechanisms" (1999, p. 99). Equally important, the evidence for the "what is it?" and "where is it?" processing pathways, for Kahneman's two decision-making systems, and for adapted cognition modules suggests that these cognitive brain specializations have evolved to address very specific problems in our environment. Because Gardner claimed that the intelligences are innate potentialities related to a general content area, MI theory lacks a rationale for the phylogenetic emergence of the intelligences.{{r|Waterhouse2006}}}}

The theory of multiple intelligences is sometimes cited as an example of [[pseudoscience]] because it lacks empirical evidence or [[falsifiability]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/24174224/Multiple_Intelligences_and_pseudo-_science Multiple Intelligences and pseudo-science] Van der Ploeg, 2016. academia.edu&lt;/ref&gt; though Gardner has argued otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Gardner | first = Howard | title = Reflections on Multiple Intelligences: Myths and Messages | journal = Phi Delta Kappan | pages = 200–209 | date = November 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use in education ==
Gardner defines an intelligence as "bio-psychological potential to process information that can be activated in a cultural setting to solve problems or create products that are of value in a culture."{{sfn|Gardner|1999|pp=33–34|ps=}} According to Gardner, there are more ways to do this than just through logical and linguistic intelligence. Gardner believes that the purpose of schooling "should be to develop intelligences and to help people reach vocational and avocational goals that are appropriate to their particular spectrum of intelligences. People who are helped to do so, [he] believe[s], feel more engaged and competent and therefore more inclined to serve society in a constructive way."{{efn|This information is based on an informal talk given on the 350th anniversary of Harvard University on 5 September 1986. Harvard Education Review, Harvard Education Publishing Group, 1987, 57, 187–93.}}

Gardner contends that IQ tests focus mostly on logical and linguistic intelligence. Upon doing well on these tests, the chances of attending a prestigious college or university increase, which in turn creates contributing members of society.{{sfn|Gardner|1993|p=6|ps=}} While many students function well in this environment, there are those who do not. Gardner's theory argues that students will be better served by a broader vision of education, wherein teachers use different methodologies, exercises and activities to reach all students, not just those who excel at linguistic and logical intelligence. It challenges educators to find "ways that will work for this student learning this topic".{{sfn|Gardner|1999|p=154|ps=}}

[[James Traub]]'s article in ''The New Republic'' notes that Gardner's system has not been accepted by most academics in intelligence or teaching.{{r|Traub}} Gardner states that "while Multiple Intelligences theory is consistent with much
empirical evidence, it has not been subjected to strong experimental tests&amp;nbsp;... Within the area of education, the applications of the theory are currently being examined in many projects. Our hunches will have to be revised many times in light of actual classroom experience."{{sfn|Gardner|1993|p=33|ps=}}

[[Jerome Bruner]] agreed with Gardner that the intelligences were "useful fictions," and went on to state that "his approach is so far beyond the data-crunching of mental testers that it deserves to be cheered."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1983/oct/27/state-of-the-child/ |title=State of the Child |last=Bruner |first=Jerome |publisher=New York Review of Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Armitage Miller|George Miller]], a prominent cognitive psychologist, wrote in ''The New York Times Book Review'' that Gardner's argument consisted of "hunch and opinion" and Charles Murray and Richard J. Herrnstein in ''[[The Bell Curve]]'' (1994) called Gardner's theory "uniquely devoid of psychometric or other quantitative evidence."{{r|Eberstadt}}

In spite of its lack of general acceptance in the psychological community, Gardner's theory has been adopted by many schools, where it is often conflated with [[learning styles]],{{sfn|Howard-Jones|2010|p=23|ps=}} and hundreds of books have been written about its applications in education.{{sfn|Davis|Christodoulou|Seider|Gardner|2011|p=486|ps=}} Some of the applications of Gardner's theory have been described as "simplistic" and Gardner himself has said he is "uneasy" with the way his theory has been used in schools.{{r|Revell}} Gardner has denied that multiple intelligences are learning styles and agrees that the idea of learning styles is incoherent and lacking in empirical evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2013/10/16/howard-gardner-multiple-intelligences-are-not-learning-styles/|title = Howard Gardner: 'Multiple intelligences' are not 'learning styles'|work = The Washington Post|accessdate = 10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gardner summarizes his approach with three recommendations for educators:  individualize the teaching style (to suit the most effective method for each student), pluralize the teaching (teach important materials in multiple ways), and avoid the term "styles" as being confusing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2013/10/16/howard-gardner-multiple-intelligences-are-not-learning-styles/|title = Howard Gardner: 'Multiple intelligences' are not 'learning styles'|work = The Washington Post|accessdate = 31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14680">'''Youth engagement''' is the sentiment [[youth|young people]] feel towards a particular person, activity, place or outcome. It has been a focus of [[youth development]], [[public policy]] and [[social change]] movements for at least forty years.&lt;ref name="forumfyi.org"&gt;Pittman, K. (n.d.) [http://www.forumfyi.org/Files/balancingequation.pdf "Balancing the equation: Communities supporting youth, youth supporting communities."]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Forum For Youth Investment. Retrieved 9/12/07.&lt;/ref&gt;

==About==
A study exploring [[foster youth]] and [[aging out]] defines youth engagement as, "involving young people in the creation of their own destinies," and suggest that in [[social work]] that means "genuinely involving them in case planning and encouraging them to advocate for themselves." This sentiment was best summarized by youth who said, "Nothing about us without us.&lt;ref&gt;Strangler, G.J. and Shirk, M. (2004) ''On Their Own: What Happens to Kids When They Age Out of the Foster Care System.'' Westview Press. p 260.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of youth engagement has emerged in recent years as a leading-edge, broad-based approach and best practice to meet the needs of youth, including youth at risk. It is a process that offers  meaningful participation for youth—that is, participation with passion—and opportunities for youth to take responsibility and leadership while working in partnership with caring adults who value, respect and share power with them.&lt;ref name="trilliumfoundation.org"&gt;''{{cite web|url=http://www.trilliumfoundation.org/cms/en/publications/cms/html/knowledge_sharing/knowledge.aspx?menuid%3D258 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 6, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716064254/http://www.trilliumfoundation.org/cms/en/publications/cms/html/knowledge_sharing/knowledge.aspx?menuid=258 |archivedate=July 16, 2011 }} Ontario  Meeting the Needs of Ontario Youth].'' Trillium Foundation. Retrieved 2/6/08.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Research suggests that a supportive [[family]] background, [[mentor]]s or [[role model]]s, involvement in cooperative activities, cultivation of intrinsic interest, awareness of [[moral]] and [[political]] issues, and traits such as moral sensitivity and [[optimism]] are among the central factors that support youth engagement.&lt;ref&gt;Michaelson, M. and Nakamura, J. (2001) ''Supportive Frameworks for Youth Engagement.'' Jossey-Bass. p 12.&lt;/ref&gt; A separate study explores "the roles of [[adult support]], a [[youth-friendly]] environment, the completion of meaningful tasks, and the learning and utilization of new [[skill]]s" as key supports.&lt;ref&gt;Checkoway, B. and Gutiérrez, L. (2006) ''Youth Participation And Community Change.'' Haworth Press. p 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies suggest that [[youth council]]s, [[youth-led media]], [[youth advisory board]]s, [[youth activism|youth organizing]] and other self-advocacy and [[community youth development]] activities are the best avenues for achieving youth engagement.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, A. (2006) ''[http://www.commonaction.org/publications.pdf Washington Youth Voice Handbook]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.'' CommonAction. p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional activities such as [[youth conference]]s have also been cited.&lt;ref&gt;Pancer, S.M., Krasnor, L.R. and Loiselle, L.D. (2002) "Youth conferences as a context for engagement," ''New Directions for Youth Development. 96.'' p 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Consulting on [[public policy]], involvement in community coalitions, involving youth in organizational decision-making, and school-based [[service learning]] have all also been cited as effective venues.&lt;ref&gt;Camino, L. and Zeldin, S. (2002) "From Periphery to Center: Pathways for Youth Civic Engagement in the Day-To-Day Life of Communities," ''[[Applied Developmental Science]]. 6''(4). p 213.&lt;/ref&gt;
Both the philosophy and activities within a program or activity need to be a "good fit" for the young people participating in them.&lt;ref&gt;Larson, R., Eccles, J.S. and Mahoney, J.L. (2006) ''Organized Activities as Contexts of Development: Extracurricular Activities.'' Routledge. p 400.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, activities and campaigns including those by the [[National Commission on Resources for Youth]] and [[Youth Communications]] have been cited for their effectiveness in engaging young people.&lt;ref name="forumfyi.org" /&gt;

==Spectra of activities==
Research has identified a spectrum of approaches to youth engagement, beginning with training for adults that work with youth.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, A. (2010) ''[http://www.freechild.org/FPYEWG.pdf Youth Engagement Workshop Guide].'' Olympia, WA: [[Freechild Project]].&lt;/ref&gt; These range from traditional programs that treat youth as clients to organizations that are led by youth and for youth.&lt;ref&gt;Young Wisdom Project. (2006) ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20070823185605/http://www.movementstrategy.org/media/docs/1892_MSMC.pdf Making Space, Making Change.] '' Movement Strategy Center. p 16. Retrieved 1/22/08.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also groups who foster engagement among traditionally non-involved youth by working to foster more significant [[youth participation]] outside of the program or organization itself. Other points in this spectrum can include:
* Youth-serving: The program targets youth as consumers of service
* Youth input: Youth evaluate or provide feedback on the program
* Youth-engaged: Youth are involved in program development and/or delivery and
* Youth-led: The program concept and/or organization came from youth
* Youth-connecting: The activity facilitates youth interaction and builds connections through social mediums

Each has value, and where a program or groups sits depends on the degree to which youth are engaged in the program with meaningful participation, and the degree to which the organization offering the program has policies and infrastructures to support youth involvement in a meaningful way.&lt;ref name="trilliumfoundation.org" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ilkiw, V. (2007) ''Keynote Address.'' [http://www.toronto.ca/scfy Safe Cities For Youth Conference] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607171255/http://www.toronto.ca/scfy |date=June 7, 2011 }}, Toronto, March 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcomes==
A number of foundations recognize youth engagement as a best practice in programs for young people.  For example, the [[Paul Allen Foundation]] promotes youth engagement as an avenue to achieving early [[reading proficiency]], expand opportunities for [[experiential learning]], and [[youth participation|involve young people]] in addressing community needs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pgafoundations.com/TemplateProgramArea.aspx?contentId=15 "Youth Engagement"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060721235557/http://www.pgafoundations.com/TemplateProgramArea.aspx?contentId=15 |date=July 21, 2006 }}, Paul G. Allen Family Foundations. Retrieved 9/12/07.&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Walter and Duncan Gordon Foundation]] in [[Canada]] supports youth engagement because it believes young Canadians, "already tend to think globally; take advantage of opportunities to expand their understanding of global challenges; want to contribute new ideas and perspectives to the discussion about Canadian international policy and; are creative in their use of new technologies to further their engagement in the world."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gordonfn.org/GlobalCitizenship1.cfm "Grant Programs: Global Citizenship - Youth Engagement."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816044136/http://www.gordonfn.org/GlobalCitizenship1.cfm |date=August 16, 2007 }} Walter and Duncan Gordon Foundation. Retrieved 9/12/07.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ontario Trillium Foundation]] recognizes youth engagement as a best practice and has been developing a framework to support youth engagement in its grantmaking and encourage applications that include a youth engagement approach.&lt;ref name="trilliumfoundation.org" /&gt;  [[Hands On Learning Australia]] implement youth engagement programs as an integral part of secondary education in Australian schools.  These programs attempt to reengage school age youth through building strong relationships within the context of practical activities, and also address literacy and numeracy issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://handsonlearning.org.au "Hands On Learning Australia"] Hands On Learning Australia.

Youth engagement has been identified as a key measure in promoting [[adolescent health]] programs.&lt;ref&gt;Viner, R.M. (2005) "Young people's health: the need for action," ''British Medical Journal. 330''. p 901-903.&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing the likelihood of young people voting has also been an outcome of said programs.&lt;ref&gt;Mckinney, M.S. and Banwart, M.C. (2005) "Rocking the Youth Vote Through Debate: examining the effects of a citizen versus journalist controlled debate on civic engagement," ''Journalism Studies, 6''(2) p 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Engaging youth in pro-social opportunities is also a goal in the field of [[Positive youth development|Positive Youth Development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Keys to Quality Youth Development|url=http://www.extension.umn.edu/youth/research/keys-to-quality-youth-development/|website=University of Minnesota Extension|accessdate=16 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015185715/http://www.extension.umn.edu/youth/research/keys%2Dto%2Dquality%2Dyouth%2Ddevelopment/|archive-date=2014-10-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is also seen as central to developing "inclusive participation" in [[civil society]].&lt;ref&gt;Camino, L. and Zeldin, S. (2002) "From Periphery to Center: Pathways for Youth Civic Engagement in the Day-To-Day Life of Communities," ''[[Applied Developmental Science]]. 6''(4). p 214.&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous national initiatives have utilized that belief to rationalize a variety of programs, including efforts focused on [[civic engagement]], [[social justice]] and [[education reform]].&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, S.S. and Voke, H.M. (2002) ''[http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/contentdelivery/servlet/ERICServlet?accno=ED480596 Building an Effective Citizenry: Lessons Learned from Initiatives in Youth Engagement.]'' American Youth Policy Forum. Retrieved 9/13/07.&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter field, [[student engagement]] is used to specifically address this issues within [[school]] environments.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, A. (2005) ''[http://www.soundout.org/MSIGuide.pdf Meaningful Student Involvement Guide to Students as Partners in School Change.]'' SoundOut. Retrieved 9/13/07.&lt;/ref&gt; Several researchers, such as [[Barry Checkoway]], Peter Levine and [[Shawn Ginwright]], as well as advocates including [[Karen Pittman]] and [[Adam Fletcher (activist)|Adam Fletcher]] have been acknowledged for their efforts to promote youth engagement.&lt;ref&gt;Pittman, K.

==Challenges==
Youth engagement faces a variety of obstacles. They include a "disjunction in what adults believe is important to do with young people, and what they actually do," as well as social norms that encourage youth engagement, and the presence of strong norms the discourage [[youth/adult partnerships]].&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, J.E. and Clary, E.G. (2004) ''Mobilizing Adults for Positive Youth Development: Strategies for Closing Gap between Beliefs and Behaviors.'' Springer. p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; A historical disconnect between [[Positive Youth Development]] and [[civic engagement]] has also been cited as a leading barrier.&lt;ref&gt;Mohamed, I.A.; Wheeler, W. (2001) ''Broadening the Bounds of Youth Development: Youth as Engaged Citizens.'' Innovation Center for Community and Youth Development. p 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Innovations==
Youth engagement has taken a huge growth over the past six years with the advent of social networks. The activities that promote youth development and social change movements are now shifting to the World Wide Web, fostering online communities based on interests, causes, and purpose. Young people are promoting ideas, vocalizing their goals, organizing community groups, engaging in political discussions, reclaiming identities, creating identities, connecting with others, and taking over these networks full force as their own personal environments. The engagement over social networks “forms and maintains social capital, a dimension that assesses one’s ability to stay connected with members of a community.” &lt;ref&gt;Ellison, N. B., Steinfeld, C., Lampe, C. [http://jcmc.indiana.edu/vol12/issue4/ellison.html "The benefits of Facebook “friends:” Social capital and college students’ use of online social network sites."] Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 12(4), article 1. Retrieved 4/12/10.&lt;/ref&gt; This connection is stimulated by the activity characteristic of the particular virtual community. Social network sites engage activity such as individual presentation of oneself, articulating and building outside networks, creating work-related collaboration, building romantic relationships, provoking political debates, connecting college student populations and opportunities, sharing hobbies and interests, and essentially forming anything that meets the imagination, made possible through the innovative capacities of current technology. Today’s youth are able to “tie offline networks to online memberships” through current social network sites like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, MySpace, Friendster, and Blogger. They support the “maintenance of existing social ties and the formation of new connections, connecting with others outside their pre-existing social group or location, liberating them to form communities around shared interests.” This increased social capital enhances youth engagement and manages interactions regarding current events around the world, major life changes, and relations as they move from one offline community to another such as changing schools or joining different civic and community groups. The intensity and usage over online communities are reliable indicators of current trends among youth and psychological well-being. The robust growth of this current technology is steadily growing and becoming a greater percentage of daily youth interactions.
