'''''Against The Grain: A Deep History of the Earliest States''''' is a book (hardcover release August 2017) by [[James C. Scott]] that sets out to undermine what he calls the "standard civilizational narrative" that suggests humans chose to live settled lives based on intensive agriculture because this made people safer and more prosperous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300182910/against-grain|title=Against the Grain {{!}} Yale University Press|website=yalebooks.yale.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he argues, people had to be forced to live in the early [[Sovereign state|states]], which were hierarchical, beset by malnutrition and disease, and often based on [[slavery]]. The book has been praised for re-opening some of the biggest questions in human history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/09/18/the-case-against-civilization|title=The Case Against Civilization|last=Lanchester|first=John|date=2017-09-11|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en|issn=0028-792X}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review in [[Science (journal)|''Science'']] concludes that the book's thesis "is fascinating and represents an alternative, nuanced, if somewhat speculative, scenario on how civilized society came into being."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shablovsky|first=Susan|date=2017|title=The perils of permanence|url=|journal=Science|volume=357 |issue=6350|pages=459|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Scott is among the world's most-cited political scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=PfjLsNIAAAAJ&amp;hl=en|title=james c. scott - Google Scholar Citations|website=scholar.google.ca|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent much of his career studying South-East Asia, and producing books such as ''[[The Art of Not Being Governed]]'' and ''[[Seeing Like a State]]''. He has long been a critic of state power, having previously written on the subject of [[anarchism]] in works such as ''[[Two Cheers for Anarchism]]''. ''Against the Grain'' returns to pre-history and discusses the conditions under which the first people stopped living as hunter-gatherers and moved to live in permanent settlements based on agriculture and administered by an elite. Scott challenges the conventional narrative that this change was welcome and voluntary for most participants.

== Synopsis ==

=== Chapter 1. The Domestication of Fire, Plants, Animals, and... Us ===

Scott describes the gradual process of transforming their environment that was undertaken by early humans. He begins by recounting the impact of mankind's use of fire, calling it "a species monopoly and a trump card" and detailing its desirability for its capacity to reduce the radius of a meal by concentrating foodstuffs in a smaller area around human encampments.  Scott describes the beginnings of [[sedentism]] in wetlands prior to the cultivation of cereal grains.  He then tackles the 4,000-year "gap" between the cultivation of domesticated grains and the emergence agricultural societies, claiming that it was in the best interests of early people to supplement their existing diets with cereal grains and other domesticated crops rather than to rely upon crops exclusively.  He thinks adaptability in subsistence strategies was a better option than early agriculture for our ancestors.

=== Chapter 2. Landscaping the World: The Domus Complex ===

Scott's point in this chapter is that humans [[Domestication|domesticated]] the planet more extensively than taming cattle and planting crops, and that this had deep consequences. He examines the changes that mankind has brought to its environment by being an artificial natural selection of sorts, to bring out plant types that are now unrecognizable from their progenitors and are also unable to survive without human care. We also domesticated animals by casting out those with undesired characteristics and cultivating that which pleases us. This changed animals both in behavior and physiologically, making them permanently docile and un-reactive, while also having smaller brains. These changes have negative effects upon the animals themselves, though they do result in a positive effect in output for their domesticators.

Scott then turns to what he calls "Human Parallels," ways in which human beings themselves might have been transformed by domestication. From the altered bone structures of women who were forced into agricultural labor to general size difference and proof of nutrition deficits in post-agriculture mankind, Scott argues that humans have bred their own irreversible change. Scott speculates that we may ourselves have become more docile and less aware of our surroundings. He also argues that the needs of domesticated plants and animals almost make us slaves to their meticulously specific and daily needs.

=== Chapter 3. Zoonoses: A Perfect Epidemiological Storm ===

In this chapter, Scott emphasizes the idea of Agro-Pastoralism, i.e. "plowed fields and domestic animals." He questions why a [[hunter-gatherer]], whom he believes has a relatively good and fulfilling life, would turn to this. Subsistence farming is mundane and contains more drudgery than the hunter and gatherer societies. He then asserts the reason as to why these societies transformed into agro-pastoral societies was due to coercion by the state. He cites research on an archaeological site in Mesopotamia named [[Tell Abu Hureyra|Abu Hureyra]]. Scott concurs with other scholars in the field that, "'No hunter-gatherers occupying a productive locality with a range of wild foods able to provide for all seasons are likely to have started cultivating their caloric staples willingly.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Village on the Euphrates : from foraging to farming at Abu Hureyra|last=Moore|first=A.

(Anthony J.)|isbn=9780195108064|location=London|pages=393|oclc=38433060}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Scott also points out that early states were beset by [[Zoonosis|zoonoses]], i.e. disease spread from animals to humans, that results in high morbidity rates.

=== Chapter 4. Agro-Ecology of the Early State ===

Scott explains in this chapter that many apparent achievements attributed to the state were actually present before [[state formation]]. Scott states that "If civilization is judged an achievement of the state, and if archaic civilization means [[sedentism]], farming, the domus, irrigation, and towns, then there is something radically wrong with the historical order. All of these human achievements of the Neolithic were in place well before we encounter anything like a state in Mesopotamia."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Against the grain : a deep history of the earliest states|last=Scott|first=James C|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2017|isbn=978-0-300-18291-0|location=New Haven|pages=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott then gives his definition of a state, emphasizing the indicators "that point to territoriality and a specialized state apparatus: walls, tax collection, and officials."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Against the grain: a deep history of the earliest states|last=Scott|first=James C|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2017|isbn=978-0-300-18291-0|location=New Haven|pages=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sumerian city of Uruk is an example. Scott cites that in Uruk, early agriculture required a very difficult lifestyle. Many people had to be forced by the state to do hard labor, for instance, creating irrigation channels. As a result of this, warfare between rival polities was very prevalent during this period in order to gain slave labor or to take over areas that had already been irrigated.
Scott goes so far as to claim that "Grains Make States."  The introduction of a staple food source allowed the state to heavily tax the people. Grains, especially wheat, became the best way to tax the people. Grains like wheat or rice are more valuable per weight than other sources of food, and much easier to transport. As he puts it, "The key to the nexus between grains and states lies, I believe, in the fact that only the cereal grains can serve as a basis for taxation: visible, divisible, assessable, storable, transportable, and 'rationable.' Other crops--legumes, tubers, and starch plans--have some of these desirable state-adapted qualities, but none has all of these advantages."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Against the grain: a deep history of the earliest states|last=Scott|first=James C|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2017|isbn=978-0-300-18291-0|location=New Haven|pages=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Making people pay taxes in grain forced people to shift away from other sources of food that they may have preferred.

=== Chapter 5. Population Control: Bondage and War ===

Scott describes early states as population machines. Rulers were focused on the productivity and number of "[[Domestication|domesticated]]" subjects. The early states had to collect people, settle them near the center of power, and force them to create a surplus in excess of their own needs. He also notes that since early states were full of disease, population tended to fall unless people could be replaced by new slaves.

In early states this population control often took the form of forcefully settling peoples on fertile land, and then preventing them from fleeing to avoid bondage and labour. One piece of evidence Scott cites is the earliest [[legal codes]], stating that they were "filled with such injunctions" intended to "discourage and punish flight." One code that Scott cites specifically is the [[Code of Hammurabi]]. This contains six [[law]]s intended to discourage the flight and escape of [[Slavery|slaves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/ancient/hamframe.asp|title=The Avalon Project : Code of Hammurabi|website=avalon.law.yale.edu|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The end product of this system was that the states with the most people were often the most powerful. This created compelling incentives for early states to try and increase their population and prevent the "leakage" of the population through bondage and [[war]].

=== Chapter 6. Fragility of the Early State: Collapse as Disassembly ===

Scott sees early states as liable to undermine the conditions for their own existence. Some self-inflicted causes for this vulnerability were "[[climate change]], resource depletion, disease, warfare, and migration to areas of greater abundance."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Against the grain : a deep history of the earliest states|last=Scott|first=James C|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2017|isbn=978-0-300-18291-0|location=New Haven|pages=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, areas upstream would be logged so that the logs could be floated down to the state center, but this could lead to flooding in the spring. The very first state-builders knew no prior examples that would have warned against such problems. Regardless of the causes, Scott's view is that the archaeological evidence suggests that early human communities were constantly collapsing, dispersing, coming back together and collapsing again. Scott believes that state collapse has been viewed as bad by academics due to the loss of cultural complexity, but in fact he thinks it may have been good for the majority of people involved. Building on his critique of the State from earlier chapters, Scott asserts that living in early states meant you were subjected to large scale warfare, and slavery, and that the historical periods following state collapse may have brought a higher standard of living, and freedom. To support this view, he highlights how state collapse lead to a dispersion of the population resulting in easier access to food as well as freedom from the brutality of the state and the need to produce a surplus to sustain the elite.

=== Chapter 7. The Golden Age of the Barbarians ===
Scott views "[[barbarian]]" raiders as having a symbiotic relationship with the early states. They raided the grain centers, but also traded many goods from more remote areas such as metals or animal parts. Scott thus theorizes that up until 400 or so years ago [[human]]ity was in the "Golden Age of the Barbarians." This was an era when the majority of the worlds population had never seen a [[tax collector]]. Part of this was due to the existence of "Barbarian Zones," i.e. great tracts of land where the state found it either impossible or prohibitively difficult to extend its rule. Places like "[[mountain]]s and [[steppe]]s," as well as "uncleared dense [[forest]], [[swamp]]s, [[marsh]]es, [[river delta]]s, [[The Fens|fens]], moors, [[desert]]s, [[heath]], arid wastes, and even the [[sea]] itself."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Against the grain : a deep history of the earliest states|last=Scott|first=James C|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2017|isbn=978-0-300-18291-0|location=New Haven|pages=228}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only did this place a great many people out of the reach of the state but also made them significant military threats to the state's power.

The traditional narrative is that some "barbarian" communities became [[Sedentism|sedentary]] and then developed into early states and civilization. Meanwhile, those who did not undergo this transition remained "barbarian." Scott argues that the history of "barbarians" and the state is much more fluid, that in fact some people "reverted" back to being barbarians precisely because of the failure and excesses of the state. This implies that civilization and state making was not the inexorable march of progress but rather a brutal project that people avoided when possible.

[[Samuel Moyn]] offers a mixed review. Moyn notes that Scott's work has appealed to many critics of the status quo, from the Marxist left to the libertarian right. Moyn praises Scott and calls the book "sparkling"&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/barbarian-virtues/|title=Barbarian Virtues|last=Moyn|first=Samuel|date=2017-10-05|work=The Nation|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en-US|issn=0027-8378}}&lt;/ref&gt; but wonders whether Scott is judging the state by standards make sense to modern residents of stable states but would confuse the hunter-gatherers whose passing Scott seems to mourn. Moyn writes: “That Scott presents as his major finding that eons separated the development of cultivation and the rise of the state not only cuts against any conclusion that the pathways into state bondage were inevitable; it also goes far to undermine Scott’s entire outlook.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Moyn asserts that Scott’s worldview prevents him from seeing the benefits of the state, or the state’s ability to change under democratic pressure. Moyn thinks that we owe the ideals Scott uses to harshly judge the early state—ideals like equality and liberty—to the stability and prosperity that states make possible. Moyn also thinks Scott fails to back up some of the core claims in the book, e.g. "Scott’s vague suggestions of the “egalitarianism” of nonstate peoples—and especially, in his new book, of our hunting-and-gathering ancestors—are never seriously defended."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Writing in the libertarian [[Cato Journal]], [[Jason Kuznicki]] notes that Scott's "highly unconventional" account "probably resonates with a certain strain of libertarian, even as it infuriates many others."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kuznicki|first=Jason|date=2018|title=Against the Grain: A Deep History of the Earliest States|url=|journal=Cato Journal|volume=38|pages=333–336|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kuznicki cautions that this should not be taken to imply that current-day agriculture is bad: "But our belief that agriculture in the present day is a blessing to humankind, which undoubtedly it is, does not commit us to insisting that agriculture, in all its forms, in all times and places, has always been a boon to everyone. Nor does the view that agriculture began as a curse commit us to believing that agriculture remains a curse today. Reality is allowed to be complex like that."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Overall Kuznicki thinks the book raises questions that are still of great importance, concluding that "the constant interplay between the present and the distant past is one of the most appealing aspects of this book."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Writing in the journal [[Public Choice (journal)|Public Choice]], Ennio Piano asserts that Against the Grain will reinforce Scott's reputation as a leading scholar of stateless societies. Piano sees links not only to the disciplines of history and anthropology, but also to economics, especially debates over the extent of coercion involved in creating economic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Piano|first=Ennio E.|date=2017-12-01|title=James C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1802">The '''Agri''' were an ancient people dwelling along the [[Palus Maeotis]] in antiquity. [[Strabo]] describes them as living among the [[Maeotae]], [[Sindi (people)|Sindi]], [[Dandarii]], [[Toreatae]], [[Arrechi]], [[Tarpetes]], [[Sittaceni]], [[Dosci]], and [[Aspurgiani]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0198%3Abook%3D11%3Achapter%3D2%3Asection%3D11 Strab. 11.2.11 at Tufts University]&lt;/ref&gt;

Agri is one of the [[Maeotae]] tribes, who lived in the 1st millennium BC on the east and the southeast coast of the [[Azov sea]]. Russian scientists, archeologists, historians and ethnographers in the Soviet period concluded that the Maeotae is one of the tribes of the [[Adyghe people]] ([[Circassians]]).

In the ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'' in the article about the [[Adyghe people]]) it says&lt;ref&gt;[http://gatchina3000.ru/big/002/515_bolshaya-sovetskaya.htm ''Great Soviet Encyclopedia''. [[Sub voce|s.v.]] Adyghe]&lt;/ref&gt;"Living in the basin of the river Kuban part of the tribes ([[Adyghe people]]), as a rule, be indicated (names) of ancient historians under the collective name 'Maeotae'." In the article about the Maeotae it is written.&lt;ref&gt;[http://slovari.yandex.ru/~книги/БСЭ/Меоты/ ''Great Soviet Encyclopedia''. s.v. Maeotae]&lt;/ref&gt;"Maeotae were engaged in farming and fishing. Part of the Maeotae by the language was akin to the Adygs (Circassians), the part of the Iranians. In the 4th–3rd centuries BC many of Maeotae included in the composition of the [[Bosporan kingdom]]."

== Manifesto ==
The Athens Charter for the Restoration of Historic Monuments was produced by the participants of the First International Congress 
of Architects and Technicians of Historic Monuments organized by the International Museums Office and held in Athens in 1931.
The seven points of the manifesto were:

* to establish organizations for restoration advice
* to ensure projects are reviewed with knowledgeable criticism 
* to establish national legislation to preserve historic sites
* to rebury excavations which were not to be restored. 
* to allow the use of modern techniques and materials in restoration work.
* to place historical sites under custodial protection.
* to protect the area surrounding historic sites.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5378">The '''autochthonous theory about the origin of the Bulgarians''' is [[fringe theory|an alternative]] to the official Bulgarian historiography, which dates chronologically from the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Aleksandar Nikolov, The Phenomenon of “Parahistory” in Post-Communist Bulgaria, Old Theories and New Myths on Proto-Bulgarians, in  Quest for a Suitable Past, Myths and Memory in Central and Eastern Europe with Claudia Florentina Dobre and Cristian Emilian Ghiţă as ed. Central European University Press, 2018, {{ISBN|9633861365}}, pp. 135-147.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emergence and development ==
[[Georgi Rakovski]], one of the first Bulgarian national activists, coined in 1860s the theory, to that the Bulgarians were an autochthonous population on the Balkans, known to the ancient writers as [[Thracians]].&lt;ref&gt;Dessislava Lilova, The homeland as terra incognita: geography and Bulgarian national identity, 1830s-1870s in The Balkans as Europe, 1821-1914, Volume 21 of Rochester studies in East and Central Europe with Timothy Snyder and Katherine Younger as ed., Boydell &amp; Brewer, 2018, {{ISBN|1580469159}},  pp. 31-54.&lt;/ref&gt; This historiographical concept was exposed scientific for the first time in 1910 in the book "The Origin of the Bulgarians and the beginning of the Bulgarian state and the Bulgarian church" by [[Gancho Tzenov]]. Fundamental tenet of the autochthonous theory is that the [[Bulgars]], that were actually [[Bulgarians]] are not settlers in Europe, but people who have inhabited the [[Balkans]] since antiquity. That is, they as a people, although had different names in different historical epochs, are actually direct descendants of indigenous tribes as [[Thracians]], [[Illyrians]], [[Macedones]], [[Getae]] etc., who lived on the same territory.&lt;ref&gt;Maciej Gorny, War on Paper? Physical Anthropology in the Service of States and Nations, p. 163, in Legacies of Violence: Eastern Europe’s First World War, Volume 3 Europas Osten im 20. Jahrhundert with Jochen Böhler, Wlodzimierz Borodziej and Joachim von Puttkamer as ed. Walter de Gruyter, 2014, {{ISBN|9783486857566}}, pp. 131-168.&lt;/ref&gt; 

This theory, though denied and rejected as a [[Pseudohistory|marginal one]], has its supporters and theorists in its various variations today as Georgi Rakovski and Gancho Tsenov have been rediscovered. Their theories have been updated as an alternative to the accepted [[Migration Period|migration theories]].  One of them establishes a complete continuity between ancient Balkan populations and modern Bulgarians. Thracians  are considered simply ancestors of the modern Bulgarians and their continuity is projected to the prehistoric times. Generally, proponents of ''Thracomania'' assume that the Thracians and Bulgarians are the same people, and that therefore the descended from the Thracians must be in fact Bulgarians.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Marinov and Nicolas Zorzin, Thracology and Nationalism in Bulgaria. Deconstructing Contemporaneous Historical and Archaeological Representations. EX NOVO.

The '''Baradostian culture''' was an [[Upper Paleolithic]] flint industry culture found in the [[Zagros Mountains|Zagros]] region in the border-country between [[Iraq]] and [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nycep.org/ed/download/pdf/2000o%20Asia,%20Western.pdf |title=Benco ''et al.''

Radiocarbon dates suggest that this was one of the earliest Upper Paleolithic complexes, beginning perhaps as early as 36,000 BC. Its relationship, however, to neighbouring cultures remains unclear. [[Shanidar Cave]] in Iraqi Kurdistan&lt;!-- Is this actually Baradostian? It has Mousterian layers according to its article. --&gt;, [[Warwasi]] rock-shelter, [[Kaldar Cave]] and [[Yafteh]] Cave in the western Zagros, and [[Eshkaft-e Gavi Cave]] in the southern Zagros are among the major sites to have been excavated.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} Perhaps precipitated by the most recent cold phase (the [[Würm glaciation]]) of the current ice age, the Baradostian was replaced by a local Epipaleolithic industry called the [[Zarzian culture]]. The Baradostian tool tradition marks the end of the Zagros Paleolithic sequence.

According to M. Otte, the Baradostian of the Zagros clearly belongs to Aurignacian traditions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.em-consulte.com/en/article/120954&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bric-à-brac''' or '''bric-a-brac''' (origin [[French language|French]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=bric-a-brac Online Etymology Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; first used in the [[Victorian era]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[OED]]'' first reference in English: 1840.&lt;/ref&gt; refers to lesser [[Objet d'art|objets d'art]] forming [[collecting|collections]] of [[wikt:curio|curio]]s, such as elaborately decorated teacups and small vases, compositions of feathers or [[artificial flower|wax flowers]] under glass domes, decorated eggshells, porcelain figurines, painted [[Portrait miniature|miniatures]] or photographs in stand-up frames, and so on. 

In middle-class homes bric-à-brac was used as ornament on [[mantelpiece]]s, tables, and shelves, or was displayed in [[curio cabinet]]s: sometimes these cabinets have glass doors to display the items within while protecting them from dust. Today, "bric-à-brac" refers to a selection of items of modest value, often sold in street markets and charity shops, and may be more commonly known in colloquial English as "knick knacks."

[[Edith Wharton]] and [[Ogden Codman, Jr.]], in ''The Decoration of Houses'' (1897), distinguished three gradations of quality in such "household ornaments": ''bric-à-brac'', ''bibelots'' ([[wikt:trinket|trinket]]s) and ''objets d'art''.&lt;ref&gt;"French speech... has provided at least three designations, each indicating a delicate and almost imperceptible gradation of quality": Wharton and Codman, ''The Decoration of Houses'', 1897, Ch. XVI "Bric-à-brac" p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15982">[[Image:Charles chiniquy.jpg|right|frame|Charles Chiniquy]]'''Charles P. Chiniquy''' (30 July 1809 –  16 January 1899) was Canadian [[Catholic priest]] who left the Roman Catholic Church and became a Presbyterian minister. He rode the lecture circuit denouncing the Catholic Church. His themes were that it was pagan, that Catholics worship the Virgin Mary, and that its theology is anti-Christian. He warned of plots by the Vatican to take control of the United States by importing Catholic immigrants from Ireland, Germany and France.  He suggested the Vatican was behind the assassination of Abraham Lincoln,

==Biography==
Chiniquy was born in 1809 in the  village of [[Kamouraska, Quebec|Kamouraska]], Quebec. He lost his father at an early age and was adopted by his uncle. As a young man, Chiniquy studied to become a Catholic priest at the Petit Seminaire ([[Seminary|Little Seminary]]) in [[Nicolet, Quebec]]. He was ordained a Catholic priest in 1833. After his ordination, he served his church in Quebec and later immigrated to [[Illinois]]. During the 1840s, he led a very successful {{citation needed|date=April 2015}} campaign throughout Quebec against alcohol and [[drunkenness]].

In 1855, he was sued by a prominent Catholic layman named Peter Spink in Kankakee, Illinois. After the fall court term, Spink applied for a change of venue to the court in Urbana. [[Abraham Lincoln]] was then hired by Chiniquy to defend him. The spring court action in Urbana was the highest profile libel suit in Lincoln's career.&lt;ref name=serup&gt;{{cite book | last = Serup | first = Paul | title = Who killed Abraham Lincoln? : an investigation of North America's most famous ex-priest's assertion that the Roman Catholic Church was behind the assassination of America's greatest president | publisher = Salmova Press | location = Prince George, B.C | year = 2010 | isbn = 9780981168500 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was ended in the fall court session by agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Fenster| first = Julie M. | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2007 | title = The Case of Abraham Lincoln | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | location = | isbn = 978-0-230-60809-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chiniquy clashed with the Bishop of Chicago, [[Anthony O'Regan]], over the bishop's treatment of Catholics in Chicago, particularly French Canadians. He declared that O'Regan was secretly backing Spink's suit against him. Chiniquy stated that in 1856 O'Regan threatened him with excommunication if he did not go to a new location where the bishop wanted him. Several months later the ''New York Times'' published a pastoral letter from Bishop O'Regan in which O'Regan stated that he had suspended Chiniquy and, since the priest had continued in his normal duties as a priest, the bishop excommunicated him by his letter. Chiniquy vigorously disputed that he had been excommunicated, saying publicly that the bishop was mistaken. Chiniquy left the Roman Catholic Church in 1858.&lt;ref name=serup/&gt; He claimed that the church was [[paganism|pagan]], that [[Roman Catholics]] worship the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]], that its theology spoils the [[Gospel]] and that its theology is &lt;!--[[Christianophobia]]--&gt;anti-Christian. &lt;!-- He probably meant having to do with the anti-Christ, not that it increases fear of Christians. Can another editor figure this out? --&gt; He also claimed that the [[Holy See|Vatican]] had planned to take over the United States by importing Catholic [[immigrant]]s from Ireland, Germany and France.

Chiniquy claimed that he was falsely accused by his superiors (and that Abraham Lincoln had come to his rescue), that the [[American Civil War]] was a plot against the United States of America by the Vatican, and that the Vatican was behind the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] cause, the death of President Lincoln and that Lincoln's assassins were faithful Roman Catholics ultimately serving [[Pope Pius IX]].

After leaving the Catholic Church, Chiniquy dedicated his life to trying to win his fellow French Canadians, as well as others, from Catholicism to the Protestant faith. He wrote a number of books and tracts pointing out his views on the alleged errors in the faith and practises of the Roman Catholic Church. His two most influential works are ''Fifty Years in The Church of Rome''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|location=New York; Chicago; Toronto|publisher=Fleming H. Revell|last=Chiniquy|first=Charles P|authorlink=Charles Chiniquy|title=Fifty years in the Church of Rome|year=1886|oclc=343196|url=https://archive.org/download/fiftyyearsinchur00chin/fiftyyearsinchur00chin.pdf|accessdate={{date|2013-04-02}}|archiveurl=https://archive.org/details/fiftyyearsinchur00chin|archivedate={{date|2008-06-02}}|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Priest, The Woman and The Confessional''.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=iOJ_KRl2IG0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_v2_summary_r&amp;cad=0 The Priest, The Woman and The Confessional]''&lt;/ref&gt; These books raised concerns in the United States about the Catholic Church. According to one Canadian biographer, Chiniquy is Canada's best-selling author of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Lougheed| first = Richard | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2009 | title = The Controversial Conversion of Charles Chiniquy ''Texts and Studies in Protestant History and Thought in Quebec'' | publisher = Clements Academic | location = | isbn = 978-1-894667-93-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the [[Orange Order]] and said of it "I always found them staunch and true. I consider it a great honour to be an Orangeman. Every time I go on my knees I pray that God may bless them and make them as numerous and bright as the stars of the heaven above."&lt;ref&gt;Beyond the Banners: The Story of the ORange Order, pg. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in [[Montreal, Quebec]], Canada on January 16, 1899.

To this day, some of Chiniquy's works are still promoted among Protestants and [[Sola scriptura]] believers. One of his most well known modern day followers is [[Jack Chick]], who created a comic-form adaptation of ''50 Years In The Church of Rome'' called "The Big Betrayal"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|location=Chino, CA|publisher=[[Chick Publications]]|last=Chick|first=Jack T|authorlink=Jack T. Chick|title=The Big Betrayal|type=comic book|year=1981|isbn=9780937958087|oclc=13016191|url=http://www.chick.com/catalog/comics/0251.asp|accessdate={{date|2013-03-22}}|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FK7kf8vg?url=http://www.chick.com/catalog/comics/0251.asp|archivedate=2013-03-23|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and who draws heavily on Chiniquy's claims in his own anti-Catholic tracts.

==St. Anne Colony==
Chiniquy, then a Roman Catholic priest, left Canada in the wake of a series of scandals. He was offered a fresh start by [[James Oliver Van de Velde]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago|Bishop of Chicago]], after [[Ignace Bourget]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Montreal|Bishop of Montreal]], asked him to leave in 1851. Chiniquy settled in [[St. Anne, Illinois]].&lt;ref name="Roby2000"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|location=Ottawa|publisher=National Archives of Canada and National Library of Canada|encyclopedia=[[Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online]]|issn=1709-6812|oclc=463897210|volume=12|year=2000|editor-last=English|editor-first=John|title=Chiniquy, Charles|last=Roby|first=Yves|url=http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&amp;id_nbr=6029|accessdate=27 April 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GBwUMs3b?url=http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&amp;id_nbr=6029|archivedate=27 April 2013|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chiniquy was suspended, on {{date|1856-08-19|mdy}}, for public insubordination by Van de Velde's successor, Bishop [[Anthony O'Regan]]. He continued to celebrate Mass and administer the other sacraments and was excommunicated on {{date|1856-09-03|mdy}}. About two years later, on {{date|1858-08-03|mdy}}, O'Regan's successor, Bishop [[James Duggan]], formally reconfirmed his excommunication in St. Anne. Chiniquy then left the {{abbr|RCC|Roman Catholic Church}} and, with many followers, joined the [[Presbyterian Church in the United States of America]] (PCUSA). He was admitted as a [[Presbyterian polity|Presbyterian minister]] on {{date|1860-02-01|mdy}}.&lt;ref name="Roby2000" /&gt; Within two years, Chiniquy, in trouble with the Presbytery of Chicago over his administration of charity funds and a college, according to Elizabeth Ann Kerr McDougall in the ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography'', sought a new connection in order to avoid an expensive presbytery trial.&lt;ref name="McDougall2000"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|location=Ottawa|publisher=National Archives of Canada and National Library of Canada|encyclopedia=[[Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online]]|issn=1709-6812|oclc=463897210|volume=|year=2000|editor-last=English|editor-first=John|title=Kemp, Alexander Ferrie|last=McDougall|first=Elizabeth Ann Kerr|url=http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&amp;id_nbr=5621|accessdate=27 April 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GCVhjaWa?url=http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&amp;id_nbr=5621|archivedate=27 April 2013|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The college is identified in the ''Seventh Biennial Report of the Superintendent of Public Instruction of the State of Illinois'' as Saviour's College, founded in 1860; it is listed neither in ''Universities and Colleges'' nor ''[[Academy|Academies]] and Seminaries of various grades and courses'' but in the ''Theological Seminaries and Church Schools'' class of institutions. The report states it "is designed to supply the educational wants of the colony brought by Father Chiniquy from Canada to this State, and to prepare men who will be fitted to preach the gospel in the regions whence he came." The report also quotes a description of the school, attributed to correspondence from a Montreal newspaper, unnamed in the report, that people, also unnamed in the report, "examined the [[day school]] or college, as the people there delight to call it" and wrote it had five classes ranging from students learning the [[alphabet]] to students learning the "intricacies of [[French grammar|French]] and [[English grammar]], [[composition (language)|composition]], and the other studies of the school, besides the elements of [[Algebra]], [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|location=Springfield|publisher=Illinois Journal Printing Office|title=Reports made to the General Assembly of Illinois, at its twenty-sixth session, convened 4 January 1869|year=1869|volume=2|chapter=Seventh Biennial Report of the Superintendent of Public Instruction of the State of Illinois. 1867–1868|pages=vi–vii, 212–214, 311–312

Kemp was chairman of the Synod of the Canada Presbyterian Church committee which examined Chiniquy's admission application.&lt;ref name="McDougall2000" /&gt; According to Kemp, Chiniquy was involved in both presbytery and civil court proceedings connected with the administration of charitable funds and with what Kemp described as an educational institute. This led to the Presbytery of Chicago charging him with unministerial and unchristian conduct. Chiniquy was to answer these charges before the presbytery; at that stage of the proceedings he and his congregation resolved to separate from the Presbytery of Chicago, and the [[Old School–New School Controversy|Old School]] {{abbr|PCUSA|Presbyterian Church in the United States of America}}, and to request recognition from the Canada Presbyterian Church.&lt;ref name="Kemp1863"&gt;{{cite book|location=[s.l.]|publisher=[s.n.]|last=Kemp|first=Alexander F|title=The Rev.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7338">[[File:Baptism-of-Christ-xx-Francesco-Alban.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|''Baptism of Christ'' by Francesco Albani. Since it positions John as superior to Jesus, the criterion of embarrassment has been used to argue for the historicity of the [[baptism of Jesus]] by [[John the Baptist]].]]

The '''criterion of embarrassment''' is a type of critical analysis in which an account likely to be embarrassing to its author is presumed to be true as the author would have no reason to invent an account which might embarrass him or her. Certain [[Biblical criticism|Biblical scholars]] have used this as a metric for assessing whether the [[New Testament]]'s accounts of [[Jesus]]' actions and words are [[criteria of authenticity and the historical Jesus|historically probable]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated14"&gt;Catherine M. Murphy, ''The Historical Jesus For Dummies'', For Dummies Pub., 2007. p 14&lt;/ref&gt;

The criterion of embarrassment is one point listed in the Criteria of Authenticity used by academics, the others being the [[criterion of dissimilarity]], criterion of language and environment, criterion of coherence, and the [[criterion of multiple attestation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = In Quest of Jesus|last = Tatum|first = W. Barnes|publisher = Abingdon Press|year = 1982|isbn = |location = Nashville|page = 106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The criterion of embarrassment is a long-standing tool of New Testament research. The phrase was used by [[John P. Meier]] in his book ''A Marginal Jew''; he attributed it to [[Edward Schillebeeckx]], who does not appear to have actually used the term. The earliest usage of the approach was possibly by [[Paul Wilhelm Schmiedel]] in the ''[[Encyclopaedia Biblica]]'' (1899).&lt;ref&gt;Stanley E. Porter, ''Criteria for Authenticity in Historical-Jesus Research'' (Continuum, 2004) pages 106-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
The assumption of the criterion of embarrassment is that the [[early church]] would hardly have gone out of its way to create or falsify historical material that embarrassed its author or weakened its position in arguments with opponents. Rather, embarrassing material coming from Jesus would be either suppressed or softened in later stages of the [[Gospel]] tradition. This criterion is rarely used by itself, and is typically one of a number of criteria, such as the [[criterion of dissimilarity]] and the [[criterion of multiple attestation]], along with the [[historical method]].

The [[crucifixion of Jesus]] is an example of an event that meets the criterion of embarrassment. This method of [[execution]] was considered the most shameful and degrading in the [[Roman world]], and advocates of the criterion claim this method of execution is therefore the least likely to have been invented by the followers of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Guy Davenport and Benjamin Urrutia, ''The Logia of Yeshua'', Washington, DC 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated14"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John P. Meier, ''A Marginal Jew'', Yale University Press, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N.S.Gill, [http://ancienthistory.about.com/b/a/229667.htm ''Discussion of the Historical Jesus''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070316185139/http://ancienthistory.about.com/b/a/229667.htm |date=March 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blue.butler.edu/~jfmcgrat/jesus/intro.htm |title=Blue Butler Education, '&amp;#39;Historical Study of Jesus of Nazareth - An Introduction'&amp;#39; |publisher=Blue.butler.edu |date=2005-03-04 |accessdate=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==
The criterion of embarrassment has its limitations and is almost always used in concert with the other criteria. One limitation to the criterion of embarrassment is that clear-cut cases of such embarrassment are few. A full portrait of Jesus could never be based on so little data. Clearly, context is important, as what might be considered as embarrassing in one era and social context may not have been so in another. Embarrassing details may be included as an alternative to an even more embarrassing account of the same event. As a hypothetical example, [[Saint Peter]]'s denial of Jesus could have been a substitution for an even greater misdeed of Peter.&lt;ref&gt;John P. Meier, ''A Marginal Jew'', Yale University Press, 2009. p 170&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the second point is found in the stories of the [[Infancy Gospels]]. In one account from the [[Infancy Gospel of Thomas]], a very young Jesus is said to have used his [[supernatural power]]s first to strike dead, and then revive, a playmate who had accidentally bumped into him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; If this tradition had been accepted as worthy of inclusion at some key juncture in the formation of the [[Bible#Old and New Testaments|Christian Bible]] (and hence integrated in one way or another among the [[Canonical gospels|canonical Gospels]]), arguably many modern Christians would find it quite embarrassing—especially strict believers in [[biblical inerrancy]]. But as is suggested by the existence of this early non-canonical [[pericope]], it must not have been embarrassing to some [[Early Christianity|early Christians]].&lt;ref&gt;Bart D. Ehrman, ''[[Jesus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New Millennium]],'' Oxford, 1999. pp 90–91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John P. Meier, ''A Marginal Jew: Rethinking the Historical Jesus'',  Doubleday, 1991. v. 1, pp 174–175, 317&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stanley E. Porter, ''The Criteria for Authenticity in Historical-Jesus Research: Previous Discussion and New Proposals'' Sheffield Academic Press,  2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerd Thiessen]] &amp; Dagmar Winter.  ''The Quest for the Plausible Jesus: The Question of Criteria'', Westminster John Knox Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

A further limitation is the possibility that what could be classed as embarrassing could also be an intentionally created account designed to provoke a reaction. For instance, [[Saint Peter]]'s denial of Jesus could have been written as an example of the consequences of denial. {{bibleverse||Matthew|10:32-33|NIV}}: "Whoever acknowledges me before men, I will also acknowledge him before my Father in heaven. But whoever disowns me before men, I will disown him before my Father in heaven."

A still further limitation is the fact that of all the criteria to evaluate authenticity, the criterion of embarrassment may be the most easily forged. A person who knows that having extra witnesses will bolster their credibility still has a lot of hard and uncertain work to do before they will have those witnesses on their side. A person who knows that including embarrassing details will make them more believable need do no more work than invent some embarrassing details.

{{cleanup|reason=After several splits from the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]]/[[Health consequences of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill]] articles, this article may contain information which is duplicated in the different sections. It also needs a proper restructuring.|date=February 2013}}
{{Deepwater Horizon oil spill series}}
This article covers the effect of the [[Deepwater Horizon explosion|''Deepwater Horizon'' disaster]] and the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill|resulting oil spill]] on global and national economies and the energy industry.

Weeks after the event, and while it was still in progress, the 2010 ''Deepwater Horizon'' oil spill was being discussed as a disaster with far reaching consequences sufficient to impact global economies, marketplaces and policies. It took place on April 20, 2010. These potentially included structural shifts to [[energy policy]], insurance marketplaces and [[risk assessment]], and potential liabilities of the order of tens of billions of US dollars for one or more large and well known companies - principally [[BP]].

==Impact to the global industry==

===Oil industry impact===
{{Main|United States offshore drilling debate|2010 United States deepwater drilling moratorium}}
{{See also|Hornbeck Offshore Services LLC v. Salazar}}
As a response to the disaster, on 30 April President [[Barack Obama]] ordered the federal government to hold the issuing of new offshore drilling leases until a review determined whether more safety systems were needed&lt;ref name="bloomberg010510"/&gt; and authorized teams to investigate 29 oil rigs in the Gulf in an effort to determine the cause of the disaster.&lt;ref name="CBS/AP"/&gt;  Later a six-month offshore drilling (below {{convert|500|ft}} of water) moratorium was enforced by the [[United States Department of the Interior]].&lt;ref name=upstream240610/&gt;  Secretary of the Interior [[Ken Salazar]] ordered immediate inspections of all deep-water operations in the Gulf of Mexico. An Outer Continental Shelf safety review board within the Department of the Interior is to provide recommendations for conducting drilling activities in the Gulf.&lt;ref name="CITEREFupstream2010a"/&gt;  The moratorium suspended work on 33&amp;nbsp;rigs.&lt;ref name=upstream240610/&gt;  It was challenged by several drilling and oil services companies. On 22 June, a [[United States federal judge]] on the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana]] [[Martin Leach-Cross Feldman]] when ruling in the case [[Hornbeck Offshore Services LLC v. Salazar]], lifted the moratorium finding it too broad, arbitrary and not adequately justified.&lt;ref name=upstream240610/&gt; The Department of Justice appealed to the [[5th Circuit Court of Appeals]], which granted the request for an expedited hearing. A three judge panel is scheduled to hear oral arguments on 8 July.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-240"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBB-241"/&gt;

[[File:US Crude Oil Production and Imports.svg|thumb|250px|U.S. Oil Production and Imports 1920 to 2012]]
On 30 June, Salazar said that "he is working very hard to finalize a new offshore drilling moratorium".&lt;ref name=upstream300610a/&gt; [[Michael Bromwich]], the head of the newly created [[Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement]], said that a record of "bad performance, deadly performance" by an oil company should be considered "a relevant factor" for the government when it decides if that company should be awarded future drilling leases.&lt;ref name=upstream300610a/&gt; Representative [[George Miller (California politician)|George Miller]] plans to introduce to the energy reform bill under consideration in the [[United States House of Representatives]] that a company's safety record should factor into leasing decisions. By this amendment he wants to ban BP from leasing any additional offshore area for seven years because of "extensive record of serious worker safety and environmental violations".&lt;ref name=upstream300610b/&gt;

On 28 April, the [[National Energy Board]] of Canada, which regulates offshore drilling in the [[Canadian Arctic]] and along the [[British Columbia Coast]], issued a letter to oil companies asking them to explain their argument against safety rules which require same-season relief wells.&lt;ref name="canadian regulator response"/&gt;  Five days later, the Canadian [[Minister of the Environment (Canada)|Minister of the Environment]] [[Jim Prentice]] said the government would not approve a decision to relax safety or environment regulations for large energy projects.&lt;ref name="prentice"/&gt;  On 3 May California Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] withdrew his support for a proposed plan to allow expanded [[Offshore oil and gas in California|offshore drilling projects in California]].&lt;ref name="CSM20100503"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC20100503"/&gt;  On 8 July, Florida Governor [[Charlie Crist]] called for a special session of the state legislature to draft an amendment to the state constitution banning offshore drilling in state waters, which the legislature rejected on 20 July.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-242"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBB-243"/&gt;

The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported that in 2010, 23.5% of [[Oil producing countries|U.S. oil production]] came from offshore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico&lt;ref name="AutoBB-244"/&gt;  The chief argument in the U.S. offshore drilling debate has been to make the United States less dependent on [[List of countries by oil imports|imported oil]].&lt;ref name="AutoBB-245"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBB-246"/&gt;  American dependence on imports grew from 24% in 1970&lt;ref name="AutoBB-247"/&gt; to 66% in 2008.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-248"/&gt;

Local officials in Louisiana expressed concern that the moratorium imposed in response to the spill would further harm the economies of coastal communities as the oil industry employs about 58,000 Louisiana residents and has created another 260,000 oil-related jobs, accounting for about 17% of all Louisiana jobs.&lt;ref name="CSM Sasser"/&gt;

===Global insurance and reinsurance market impact===

At the time of the disaster it was said that there were only 4 companies able to insure risks of such size.&lt;ref name="portfolio.com1"/&gt;  The impact of ''Deepwater Horizon'' on [[insurance]], [[reinsurance]] and other global markets due to the shift in [[systemic risk]] is as yet unknown. Until this incident loss of an entire semi-submersible rig in this way was considered "an unprecedented tragedy" &lt;ref name="portfolio.com1" /&gt; with an underwriter at Pritchard Capital commenting "It's never happened that a semi could burn into the sea and completely sink. Now underwriters have to include that as a risk. That’s probably $10,000 to $15,000 more per day in rig insurance. They’ll make it up by charging more on a per-rig basis." &lt;ref name="portfolio.com1" /&gt;

==Impact on the UK economy==

The [[Organization for International Investment]], a [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]-based advocate for overseas investment into the U.S., warned in early July that the political rhetoric surrounding the disaster is potentially damaging the reputation of all British companies with operations in the U.S.&lt;ref name=guardian140710/&gt; and sparked a wave of U.S. protectionism that has restricted British firms from; winning government contracts, making political donations, and lobbying.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-286"/&gt;

==Impact on the US economy==

===Fisheries===
[[File:Deepwater Horizon oil spill fishing closure map 2010-06-21.png|thumb|As of 21 June 2010, the area closed to fishing encompassed {{convert|86985|sqmi}}, or about 36% of Gulf of Mexico federal waters.|alt=21 June 2010 NOAA map of the Gulf of Mexico showing the areas closed to fishing.]]
In BP's Initial Exploration Plan, dated 10 March 2009, it said that "it is unlikely that an accidental spill would occur" and "no adverse activities are anticipated" to fisheries or fish habitat.&lt;ref name="Initial Exploration Plan Mississippi Canyon"/&gt;  On 29 April 2010, [[Louisiana Governor]] [[Bobby Jindal]] declared a [[state of emergency]] in the state after weather forecasts predicted the oil slick would reach the Louisiana coast.&lt;ref name="state of emergency"/&gt;  An emergency shrimping season was opened on 29 April so that a catch could be brought in before the oil advanced too far.&lt;ref name=CITEREFbbc2010a/&gt;  By 30 April, the USCG received reports that oil had begun washing up to wildlife refuges and seafood grounds on the Louisiana [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]].&lt;ref name=fishing1/&gt;  On 22 May 2010, the Louisiana Seafood Promotion and Marketing Board stated said 60 to 70% of [[oyster]] and [[Callinectes sapidus|blue crab]] harvesting areas and 70 to 80% of fin-fisheries remained open.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-198"/&gt;  The Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals closed an additional ten oyster beds on 23 May, just south of [[Lafayette, Louisiana]], citing confirmed reports of oil along the state's western coast.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-199"/&gt;

On 2 May 2010, NOAA closed commercial and recreational fishing in affected federal waters between the mouth of the Mississippi River and Pensacola Bay. The closure initially incorporated {{convert|6814|sqmi}}.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-200"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBB-201"/&gt;  By 21 June, NOAA had increased the area under closure over a dozen times, encompassing by that date {{convert|86985|sqmi}}, or approximately 36% of Federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico, and extending along the coast from [[Atchafalaya Basin|Atchafalaya Bay]], Louisiana to [[Panama City, Florida]].&lt;ref name="AutoBB-202"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBB-203"/&gt;  On 24 May, the federal government declared a fisheries disaster for the states of Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-204"/&gt;  Initial cost estimates to the fishing industry were $2.5&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name="fishing1" /&gt;

On 23 June, NOAA ended its fishing ban in {{convert|8000|sqmi}}, leaving {{convert|78597|sqmi}} with no fishing allowed,&lt;ref name="AutoBB-205"/&gt; or about one-third of the Gulf. The continued fishing ban was meant to assure the safety of seafood, and NOAA inspectors announced that as of 9 July, Kevin Griffis of the [[United States Department of Commerce|Commerce Department]] said, only one seafood sample out of 400 tested did not pass, and even that one did not include "concerning levels of contaminants".&lt;ref name=Skoloff/&gt;  On 10 August, Jane Lubchenco of NOAA said no one had seen oil in a {{convert|8000|sqmi}} area east of Pensacola since 3 July, so the fishing ban in that area was being lifted.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-206"/&gt;

On 31 August, a Boston lab hired by the United Commercial Fishermen's Association to analyze coastal fishing waters said it found dispersant in a seafood sample taken near Biloxi, Miss., almost a month after BP said it had stopped using the chemical.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-207"/&gt;

According to the [[European Space Agency]], the agency's satellite data was used by the Ocean Foundation to conclude that 20% of the juvenile [[Atlantic bluefin tuna|bluefin tuna]] were killed by oil in the gulf's most important spawning area. The foundation combined satellite data showing the oil spill extent each week with data on weekly tuna spawning to make their conclusion. The agency also said that the loss of juvenile tuna was significant due to the 82% decline of the tuna's spawning stock in the western Atlantic during the 30 years before the oil spill.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-208"/&gt;

The waters had been reopened to fishing on 15 November 2010,&lt;ref name="AutoBB-209"/&gt; but on 24 November NOAA re-closed {{convert|4200|sqmi}} area to shrimping.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-210"/&gt;  A Florida TV station sent frozen Gulf shrimp to be tested for petroleum by-products after recent reports showed scientists disagreed on whether it is safe to eat after the oil spill.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-211"&gt;[http://www.abcactionnews.com/dpp/news/local_news/gulf-seafood-safe%3F-experts-disagree-wptv1290203315314 Gulf seafood safe?

This was the twelfth and final reopening in federal waters since 22 July, and opened all the formerly closed areas in Federal waters.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-214"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/04/110420081520.htm |title=All U.S. federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico once closed to fishing due to spill now open |publisher=Sciencedaily.com |date=20 April 2011 |accessdate=2011-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allowable levels for the toxins in Gulf seafood are based on health impacts for a 176-pound adult eating less than 2 medium shrimp per day.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-215"&gt;{{cite web|author=AlterNet / By Lisa Kaas Boyle |url=http://www.alternet.org/story/155032/eyeless_shrimp_and_fish_with_tumors%3A_the_horrific_consequences_of_bp%27s_spill?page=entire |title=Eyeless Shrimp and Fish With Tumors: The Horrific Consequences of BP's Spill |publisher=AlterNet |date=18 April 2012 |accessdate=2012-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011 BP released a report&lt;ref name="AutoBB-216"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gulfcoastclaimsfacility.com/BP_7_7_11_Supplemental_Comment.pdf |accessdate=9 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515155758/http://gulfcoastclaimsfacility.com/BP_7_7_11_Supplemental_Comment.pdf |archivedate=15 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that the economy had recovered and there was no reason to believe that anyone would suffer future losses from the spill, with the limited exception of oyster harvesters. However, Bruce Guerra, a crab fisherman in Louisiana for 25 years, said that since the BP oil spill crabbers are trapping 75 percent fewer crabs and that "crabs have been coming up dead, discolored, or riddled with holes since last year's spill".  Others in the fishing industry say it could take years to fully realize the spill's effects. "The problem is right when they used the dispersants, that's when the tuna came to the Gulf to spawn," said Cheril Carey, a national sales representative for a Louisiana company specializing in yellow fin tuna. "It takes a tuna five to 15 years to mature. So although we may have fish now, we may not have them in five to 15 years."&lt;ref name="AutoBB-217"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwltv.com/news/BP-wants-to-end-payments-for-future-losses-Fisherman-react-125252384.html |title=Fishermen angry as BP pushes to end payments for future losses &amp;#124; wwltv.com New Orleans |publisher=Wwltv.com |accessdate=2011-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110920150119/http://www.wwltv.com/news/BP-wants-to-end-payments-for-future-losses-Fisherman-react-125252384.html |archivedate=20 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2012 local fishermen report that crab, shrimp, and oyster fishing operations have not yet recovered from the oil spill and many fear that the Gulf seafood industry will never recover.  One Mississippi shrimper who was interviewed said he used to get 8,000 pounds of shrimp in four days, but this year he got only 800 pounds a week.  Mississippi's oyster reefs have been closed since the spill started. A Louisiana fisherman said the local oyster industry might do 35 per cent this year, "If we're very lucky."  Dr Ed Cake, a biological oceanographer and a marine and oyster biologist, said that many of the Gulf fisheries have collapsed and "If it takes too long for them to come back, the fishing industry won't survive".&lt;ref name="AutoBB-218"&gt;[http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2012/03/20123571723894800.html Gulf fisheries in decline after oil disaster - Features - Al Jazeera English&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2010, [[SBP (nonprofit organization)]] began to provide assistance to fishermen affected by what came to be known as the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]].&lt;ref name="climatechange"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sandberg|first1=L.

===Tourism===
[[File:Orange Beach Do Not Swim sign walkway.JPG|thumb|right|Sign in [[Orange Beach, Alabama]] advising against swimming due to the oil spill]]
Although many people cancelled their vacations due to the spill, hotels close to the coasts of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama reported dramatic increases in business during the first half of May 2010. However, the increase was likely due to the influx of people who had come to work with oil removal efforts. Jim Hutchinson, assistant secretary for the Louisiana Office of Tourism, called the occupancy numbers misleading, but not surprising. "Because of the oil slick, the hotels are completely full of people dealing with that problem," he said. "They're certainly not coming here as tourists.

On 25 May, BP gave Florida $25&amp;nbsp;million to promote the beaches where the oil had not reached, and the company planned $15&amp;nbsp;million each for Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi. The Bay Area Tourist Development Council bought [[digital billboard]]s showing recent photos from the gulf coast beaches as far north as [[Nashville, Tennessee]] and [[Atlanta]]. Along with assurances that the beaches were so far unaffected, hotels cut rates and offered deals such as free golf. Also, cancellation policies were changed, and refunds were promised to those where oil may have arrived. However, revenues remained below 2009 levels.&lt;ref name="thesunnews1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Anderson&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesunnews.com/2010/06/04/1511778/oil-could-hit-strand-by-july.html|title=Oil could hit Myrtle Beach area by July|last=Anderson|first=Lorena|work=The Sun News |date=4 June 2010 |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Travel Association estimated that the economic impact of the oil spill on tourism across the Gulf Coast over a three-year period could exceed approximately $23 billion, in a region that supports over 400,000 travel industry jobs generating $34 billion in revenue annually.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-219"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nivac.info/?p=824 |title=Big price tag for recovery of Gulf Coast |last=Proctor |first=Carleton |work=Pensacola News Journal |date=1 August 2010 |accessdate=2010-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427044922/http://www.nivac.info/?p=824 |archivedate=27 April 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBB-220"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ustravel.org/sites/default/files/page/2009/11/Gulf_Oil_Spill_Analysis_Oxford_Economics_710.pdf |title=Potential Impact of the Gulf Oil Spill on Tourism |author=Oxford Economics |date=21 July 2010 |accessdate=2010-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507030043/http://www.ustravel.org/sites/default/files/page/2009/11/Gulf_Oil_Spill_Analysis_Oxford_Economics_710.pdf |archivedate=7 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Real estate prices===
The real estate prices and a number of transactions in the Gulf of Mexico area decreased significantly during the period of the oil spill. As a result, area officials wanted the state legislature to allow [[property tax]] to be paid based on current market value, which according to Florida [[Florida Legislature|State Rep.]] [[Dave Murzin]] could mean millions of dollars in losses for each county affected.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-225"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=10988208 |title=Gulf property sales slide further on oil fears |last=Farrington |first=Brendan |work=The Sun News |agency=Associated Press |date=23 June 2010 |accessdate=2010-06-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702154922/http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=10988208 |archivedate=2 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===BP's expenditures on the oil spill===
On 5 July 2010, BP reported that its own expenditures on the oil spill had reached $3.12&amp;nbsp;billion, including the cost of the spill response, containment, relief well drilling, grants to the Gulf states, claims paid, and federal costs.&lt;ref name="BP costs for oil spill response pass $3 billion"&gt;{{cite news|agency=The Associated Press| title= BP costs for oil spill response pass $3&amp;nbsp;billion|last= Breen|first= Tom|date=5 July 2010|accessdate=2010-07-05| url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/jul/5/bp-costs-oil-spill-response-pass-3-billion/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 1 October 2010, BP has spent $11.2 billion.&lt;ref name="newsobserver.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name=abc011010&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/01/AR2010100101380.html |title=BP says oil spill costs rise to $11.2 billion |last=Wardell|first=Jane|agency= The Associated Press| newspaper = The Washington Post |date=1 October 2010|accessdate=2010-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of March 2012, BP estimated the company's total spill-related expenses do not exceed $37.2 billion.&lt;ref name=settleAP&gt;{{cite news|title=BP begins to put spill behind it with settlement|first1=Jonathan|last1=Fahey|first2=Chris|last2=Kahn|date=3 March 2012|work=[[CBN News]]|agency=[[The Associated Press]]|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/46613428|accessdate=20 January 2013}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Market value===
BP's stock fell by 51% in 40 days on the [[New York Stock Exchange]], going from $60.57 on 20 April 2010, to $29.20 on 9 June, its lowest level since August 1996. On 25 June, BP's market value reached a 1-year low. The company's total value lost since 20 April was $105&amp;nbsp;billion. Investors saw their holdings in BP shrink to $27.02, a nearly 54% loss of value in 2010.&lt;ref name="BP's stock hits new low"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=New York Post |title=Stormy weather: BP's stock hits low and high |date=25 June 2010 |accessdate=2010-06-27 |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/business/stormy_weather_bp_stock_hits_new_R9j0pMVMYMpgrQodvaymOP|first=Paul|last=Tharp}}&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, the company's loss in market value totalled $60 billion, a 35% decline since the explosion. At that time, BP reported a second-quarter loss of $17 billion, its first loss in 18 years. This included a one-time $32.2 billion charge, including $20 billion for the [[#Spill response fund|fund]] created for reparations and $2.9 billion in actual costs.&lt;ref name=Wardell&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/business/deepwaterhorizon/7126429.html |title=BP replaces CEO Hayward, reports $17 billion loss |last=Wardell |first=Jane |agency=Associated Press |date=27 July 2010 |accessdate=2010-12-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100930003010/http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/business/deepwaterhorizon/7126429.html |archivedate=30 September 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

BP announced that it was setting up a new unit to oversee management of the oil spill and its aftermath, to be headed by former [[TNK-BP]] chief executive [[Bob Dudley|Robert Dudley]],&lt;ref name=upstream080610&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.upstreamonline.com/live/article217033.ece |title= BP calls in FPSO for Macondo |last1=Brenner |first1=Noah |last2=Pitt |first2=Anthea|newspaper=Upstream Online|publisher=NHST Media Group |date=8 June 2010 |accessdate=2010-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; who a month later was named CEO of BP.&lt;ref name=Wardell/&gt;

On 1 October, BP's [[London Stock Exchange]] price reached 439.75 pence, the highest point since 28 May.&lt;ref name="abc011010"/&gt;

By 2013, BP had dropped from the second to the fourth largest of the four major oil companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/05/us-bp-results-urgent-idUSBRE91409C20130205?irpc=932 | work=Reuters | title=Smaller BP's profits down as oil spill trial looms | date=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 September 2014, when BP was found guilty of gross negligence and willful misconduct under the Clean Water Act (CWA), which could see it liable for up to $18 billion in additional fines, the company's shares lost 6 percent of their value.&lt;ref name="BPverdict"&gt;{{cite news|title=BP found "grossly negligent' in Gulf of Mexico oil sp|url=http://www.neworleanssun.com/index.php/sid/225407625|date=4 September 2014|accessdate=5 September 2014|publisher=''New Orleans Sun''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drop in sale===
BP gas stations in the United States, the majority of which the company does not own, reported sales off between 10 and 40% due to backlash against the company. Some BP station owners that lost sales said the name should change back to [[Amoco]], while others said after all the effort that went into promoting BP, such a move would be a gamble, and the company should work to restore its image.&lt;ref name="AutoBB-224"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/38493212/ns/business-us_business/|title=Time to scrap BP brand?

{{political anthropology}}

'''Ernest André Gellner''' (9 December 1925 – 5 November 1995) was a British-Czech [[philosopher]] and [[social anthropology|social anthropologist]] described by ''The Daily Telegraph'', when he died, as one of the world's most vigorous intellectuals, and by ''The Independent'' as a "one-man crusader for [[critical rationalism]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stirling|first1=Paul|title=Ernest Gellner Obituary|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=9 November 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His first book, ''Words and Things'' (1959), prompted a leader in ''The Times'' and a month-long correspondence on its letters page over his attack on [[linguistic philosophy]]. As the Professor of Philosophy, Logic and Scientific Method at the [[London School of Economics]] for 22 years, the [[William Wyse Professor of Social Anthropology]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] for eight years, and head of the new Centre for the Study of Nationalism in Prague, Gellner fought all his life—in his writing, teaching and political activism—against what he saw as closed systems of thought, particularly [[communism]], [[psychoanalysis]], [[relativism]] and the dictatorship of the [[free market]]. Among other issues in social thought, [[modernization theory]] and [[nationalism]] were two of his central themes, his multicultural perspective allowing him to work within the subject-matter of three separate civilizations: Western, Islamic, and Russian. He is considered one of the leading theoreticians on the issue of nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=ERIKSEN|first1=THOMAS HYLLAND|title=Nationalism and the Internet|journal=Nations and Nationalism|date=January 2007|volume=13|issue=1|pages=1–17|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8129.2007.00273.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Gellner was born in [[Paris]]&lt;ref name=IndepObit&gt;Chris Hann, [http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/gellner/Bio.html Obituary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060213012158/http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/gellner/Bio.html |date=13 February 2006 }}, ''The Independent'', 8 November 1995&lt;/ref&gt; to Anna, née Fantl, and Rudolf, a lawyer, an urban intellectual German-speaking [[Jews|Jew]]ish couple from [[Bohemia]] (which, since 1918, was part of the newly established [[Czechoslovakia]]). [[Julius Gellner]] was his uncle. He was brought up in [[Prague]], attending a [[Czech language]] primary school before entering the English-language grammar school. This was [[Franz Kafka]]'s tricultural Prague: [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] but "stunningly beautiful", a city he later spent years longing for.&lt;ref name=interview&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/researchAndExpertise/units/gellner/InterGellner.html|title=Gellner Interview|accessdate=5 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, when Gellner was 13, the rise of [[Adolf Hitler]] in [[Germany]] persuaded his family to leave Czechoslovakia and move to [[St Albans]], just north of [[London]], where Gellner attended St Albans Boys Modern School, now [[Verulam School]] (Hertfordshire). At the age of 17, he won a scholarship to [[Balliol College, Oxford]] as a result of what he called "Portuguese colonial policy", which involved keeping "the natives peaceful by getting able ones from below into Balliol."&lt;ref name=interview/&gt;
[[File:Prague from Klementinum.jpg|left|thumb|300px|"Prague is a stunningly beautiful town, and during the first period of my exile, which was during the war, I constantly used to dream about it, in the literal sense: it was a strong longing."&lt;ref name=interview/&gt;]]

At Balliol, he studied [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]] (PPE) and specialised in philosophy. He interrupted his studies after one year to serve with the [[1st Czechoslovak Armoured Brigade]], which took part in the [[Siege of Dunkirk (1944–45)]], and then returned to Prague to attend university there for half a term.

During this period, Prague lost its strong hold over him: foreseeing the communist takeover, he decided to return to England. One of his recollections of the city in 1945 was a communist poster saying: "Everyone with a clean shield into the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia|Party]]", ostensibly meaning that those whose records were good during the occupation were welcome. In reality, Gellner said, it meant exactly the opposite:
{{Quote|If your shield is absolutely filthy we'll scrub it for you; you are safe with us; we like you the better because the filthier your record the more we have a hold on you. So all the bastards, all the distinctive [[Authoritarian personality|authoritarian personalities]], rapidly went into the Party, and it rapidly acquired this kind of character. So what was coming was totally clear to me, and it cured me of the emotional hold which Prague had previously had over me. I could foresee that a [[Joseph Stalin|Stalinoid]] [[dictatorship]] was due: it came in '48. The precise date I couldn't foresee, but that it was due to come was absolutely obvious for various reasons.... I wanted no part of it and got out as quickly as I could and forgot about it.&lt;ref name=interview/&gt;}}
He returned to Balliol College in 1945 to finish his degree, winning the [[John Locke]] prize and taking [[British undergraduate degree classification|first class honours]] in 1947. The same year, he began his academic career at the [[University of Edinburgh]] as an assistant to Professor [[John Macmurray]] in the Department of Moral Philosophy. He moved to the London School of Economics in 1949, joining the sociology department under [[Morris Ginsberg]]. Ginsberg admired philosophy and believed that philosophy and sociology were very close to each other.

{{Quote|He employed me because I was a philosopher. Even though he was technically a professor of sociology, he wouldn't employ his own students, so I benefited from this, and he assumed that anybody in philosophy would be an evolutionary Hobhousean like himself. It took him some time to discover that I wasn't.&lt;ref name="interview2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/researchAndExpertise/units/gellner/Section2.html|title=Interview section 2|accessdate=5 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

[[Leonard Trelawny Hobhouse]] had preceded Ginsberg as Martin White Professor of Sociology at the LSE. Hobhouse's ''Mind in Evolution'' (1901) had proposed that society should be regarded as an organism, a product of evolution, with the individual as its basic unit, the subtext being that society would improve over time as it evolved, a [[teleology|teleological]] view that Gellner firmly opposed.

{{Quote|Ginsberg... was totally unoriginal and lacked any sharpness. He simply reproduced the kind of evolutionary [[Rationalism|rationalistic]] vision which had already been formulated by Hobhouse and which incidentally was a kind of extrapolation of his own personal life: starting in Poland and ending up as a fairly influential professor at LSE. He evolved, he had an idea of a [[great chain of being]] where the lowest form of life was the drunk, Polish, anti-Semitic peasant and the next stage was the Polish gentry, a bit better, or the Staedtl, better still. And then he came to England, first to [[University College London|University College]] under Dawes Hicks, who was quite rational (not all that rational—he still had some anti-Semitic prejudices, it seems) and finally ended up at LSE with Hobhouse, who was so rational that rationality came out of his ears. And so Ginsberg extrapolated this, and on his view the whole of humanity moved to ever greater rationality, from drunk Polish peasant to T.L. Hobhouse and a Hampstead garden.&lt;ref name=interview2/&gt;}}

Gellner's critique of linguistic philosophy in ''Words and Things'' (1959) focused on [[J. L. Austin]] and the later work of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], criticizing them for failing to question their own methods. The book brought Gellner critical acclaim. He obtained his Ph.D. in 1961 with a thesis on ''Organization and the Role of a [[Berbers|Berber]] [[Zawiya (institution)|Zawiya]]'' and became Professor of Philosophy, Logic and Scientific Method just one year later. ''Thought and Change'' was published in 1965, and in ''State and Society in Soviet Thought'' (1988), he examined whether Marxist regimes could be liberalized.

He was elected to the [[British Academy]] in 1974. He moved to Cambridge in 1984 to head the Department of Anthropology, holding the [[William Wyse Professor of Social Anthropology|William Wyse chair]] and becoming a fellow of [[King's College, Cambridge]], which provided him with a relaxed atmosphere where he enjoyed drinking beer and playing [[chess]] with the students. Described by the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography#Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' as "brilliant, forceful, irreverent, mischievous, sometimes perverse, with a biting wit and love of irony", he was famously popular with his students, was willing to spend many extra hours a day tutoring them, and was regarded as a superb public speaker and gifted teacher.&lt;ref name=IndepObit/&gt;

His ''Plough, Sword and Book'' (1988) investigated the philosophy of history, and ''Conditions of Liberty'' (1994) sought to explain the collapse of [[socialism]]. In 1993, he returned to Prague, now rid of communism, and to the new [[Central European University]], where he became head of the Center for the Study of Nationalism, a program funded by [[George Soros]], the American billionaire philanthropist, to study the rise of [[nationalism]] in the post-communist countries of eastern and central [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nationalism.ceu.edu/ Nationalism Studies Program] at the CEU&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 November 1995, after returning from a conference in [[Budapest]], he suffered a heart attack and died at his flat in Prague, one month short of his 70th birthday.

Gellner was noted for his questionable sense of humour. His daughter, Sarah Gellner, revealed that one of her father's favourite jokes was "Rape, rape, rape, all summer long", and that "If there was one thing Dad disliked more than feminists, it was homosexual men."&lt;ref name="LRB v33 n16"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v33/n16/letters |date=25 August 2011 |title=Letters: Memories of Ernest Gellner |journal=London Review of Books |volume=33 |number=16 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Words and Things''==
[[File:Balliol College Feb 2005.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Gellner discovered his interest in linguistic philosophy while at Balliol.]]
With the publication in 1959 of ''Words and Things'', his first book, Gellner achieved fame and even notoriety among his fellow philosophers, as well as outside the discipline, for his fierce attack on [[ordinary language philosophy]] (or "linguistic philosophy", Gellner's preferred phrase). Ordinary language philosophy, in one form or another, was the dominant approach at [[Oxbridge]] at the time (although the philosophers themselves denied that they were part of any unified school). He first encountered the strong ideological hold of linguistic philosophy while at Balliol:
{{quotation|[A]t that time the orthodoxy best described as linguistic philosophy, inspired by Wittgenstein, was crystallizing and seemed to me totally and utterly misguided. Wittgenstein's basic idea was that there is no general solution to issues other than the custom of the community. Communities are ultimate. He didn't put it this way, but that was what it amounted to. And this doesn't make sense in a world in which communities are not stable and are not clearly isolated from each other. Nevertheless, Wittgenstein managed to sell this idea, and it was enthusiastically adopted as an unquestionable revelation. It is very hard nowadays for people to understand what the atmosphere was like then. This was ''the'' Revelation. It wasn't doubted. But it was quite obvious to me it was wrong. It was obvious to me the moment I came across it, although initially, if your entire environment, and all the bright people in it, hold something to be true, you assume you must be wrong, not understanding it properly, and they must be right. And so I explored it further and finally came to the conclusion that I did understand it right, and it was rubbish, which indeed it is.&lt;ref name=interview2/&gt;}}
''Words and Things'' is fiercely critical of the work of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[J. L. Austin]], [[Gilbert Ryle]], [[Antony Flew]], [[P. F. Strawson]] and many others. Ryle refused to have the book reviewed in the philosophical journal ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'' (which he edited), and [[Bertrand Russell]] (who had written an approving foreword) protested in a letter to ''[[The Times]]''. A response from Ryle and a lengthy correspondence ensued.&lt;ref&gt;T. P. Uschanov, [http://www.helsinki.fi/~tuschano/writings/strange/ The Strange Death of Ordinary Language Philosophy]. The controversy has been described by the writer [[Ved Mehta]] in ''Fly and the Fly Bottle'' (1963).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social anthropology==
In the 1950s, Gellner discovered his great love of [[social anthropology]]. Chris Hann, director of the [[Max Planck Institute for Social Anthropology]], writes that following the hard-nosed empiricism of [[Bronisław Malinowski]], Gellner made major contributions to the subject over the next 40 years, ranging from "conceptual critiques in the analysis of kinship to frameworks for understanding political order outside the state in tribal [[Morocco]] (''Saints of the Atlas'', 1969); from sympathetic exposition of the works of Soviet Marxist anthropologists to elegant syntheses of the Durkheimian and Weberian traditions in western social theory; and from grand elaboration of 'the structure of human history' to path-breaking analyses of ethnicity and nationalism (''[[Thought and Change]]'', 1964; ''[[Nations and Nationalism (book)|Nations and Nationalism]]'', 1983)".&lt;ref name=IndepObit/&gt;

==Nationalism==
{{main article|Gellner's theory of nationalism}}
In 1983, Gellner published ''Nations and Nationalism''. For Gellner, "[[nationalism]] is primarily a political principle that holds that the political and the national unit should be congruent".&lt;ref&gt;Gellner, ''Nationalism'', 1983, p.&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/ref&gt; Gellner argues that nationalism appeared and became a sociological necessity only in the modern world. In previous times ("the agro-literate" stage of history), rulers had little incentive to impose cultural homogeneity on the ruled. But in modern society, work becomes technical; one must operate a machine, and to do so, one must learn. There is a need for impersonal, context-free communication and a high degree of cultural standardisation.

Furthermore, [[industrial society]] is underlined by the fact that there is perpetual growth: employment types vary and new skills must be learned. Thus, generic employment training precedes specialised job training. On a territorial level, there is competition for the overlapping [[catchment area]]s (such as [[Alsace-Lorraine]]). To maintain its grip on resources and its survival and progress, the state and culture must for these reasons be congruent. Nationalism, therefore, is a necessity.

He achieved wide recognition in his day and—while primarily influential within the [[Continental philosophy|continental]] tradition of philosophy—has become increasingly influential in the [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]] tradition as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/hegel/|title=Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|first=Redding|last=Paul|authorlink=Paul Redding|date=13 February 1997|publisher=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Hegel remains a divisive figure, his canonical stature within [[Western philosophy]] is universally recognized.

Hegel's principal achievement was his development of a distinctive articulation of [[idealism]], sometimes termed ''[[absolute idealism]]'',&lt;ref&gt;This term is actually quite rare in Hegel's writings. It does not occur anywhere in ''The Science of Logic'' (though he comes close in a remark on p. 124 of the [2010] di Giovanni translation, GW 21.142). In the ''Encyclopedia'' presentation of his logic it can be found only at §45R. Greraets, Suchting and Harris note in the introduction to their translation of this later text that the term is more strongly associated with English movement in that later part of the 19th century (Hackett: 1991, xiii).&lt;/ref&gt; in which the dualisms of, for instance, mind and nature and [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]] and [[Object (philosophy)|object]] are overcome. His philosophy of spirit conceptually integrates psychology, the state, history, art, religion and philosophy. His account of the [[master–slave dialectic]] has been highly influential, especially in 20th-century France.&lt;ref&gt;Overwhelmingly due to [[Alexandre Kojève]]'s influential lectures published as ''Introduction à la lecture de Hegel'' (Paris, 1947), selections translated into English by James Nichols as ''Introduction to the Reading of Hegel'' (New York, 1969). See, for instance, Aimé Patri, "Dialectique du Maître et de l’Esclave", Le Contrat Social, V, No. a (July–August 196r), 234, cited in Editor's Introduction (vii) on the extent of their influence.&lt;/ref&gt; Of special importance is his concept of spirit (''[[Geist]]'', sometimes also translated as "mind") as the historical manifestation of the logical concept and the [[Aufheben|"sublation"]] (''Aufhebung'', integration without [[Reduction (philosophy)|elimination or reduction]]) of seemingly contradictory or opposing factors: examples include the apparent opposition between nature and [[Freedom of will|freedom]] and between [[immanence]] and [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]]. Hegel has been seen in the 20th century as the originator of the [[thesis, antithesis, synthesis]] triad,&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert C. Solomon]], ''In the Spirit of Hegel'', Oxford University Press, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; but as an explicit phrase it originated with [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]].&lt;ref name=Fichte&gt;"Review of ''[[Aenesidemus (book)|Aenesidemus]]''" ([http://www.gleichsatz.de/b-u-t/trad/fichte/jgf-aenesidemus.html "Rezension des Aenesidemus"], ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Allgemeine Literatur-Zeitung|de}}'', February 11–12, 1794). Trans. Daniel Breazeale. In {{cite book| last1=Breazeale|first1=Daniel|last2=Fichte|first2=Johann|title=Fichte: Early Philosophical Writings|date=1993|publisher=Cornell University Press|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel has influenced many thinkers and writers whose own positions vary widely.&lt;ref&gt;"One of the few things on which the analysts, pragmatists, and existentialists agree with the dialectical theologians is that Hegel is to be repudiated: their attitude toward Kant, Aristotle, Plato, and the other great philosophers is not at all unanimous even within each movement; but opposition to Hegel is part of the platform of all four, and of the Marxists, too." [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]], [http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/us/kaufmann.htm "The Hegel Myth and Its Method"] in ''From Shakespeare to Existentialism: Studies in Poetry, Religion, and Philosophy'', Beacon Press, Boston, 1959 (pp.&amp;nbsp;88–119).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Barth]] described Hegel as a "Protestant [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]]"&lt;ref&gt;"Why did Hegel not become for the Protestant world something similar to what Thomas Aquinas was for Roman Catholicism?" (Karl Barth, ''Protestant Thought from Rousseau to Ritschl: Being the Translation Of Eleven Chapters of Die Protestantische Theologie im 19. Jahrhundert'', 268 Harper, 1959).&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] wrote that "all the great philosophical ideas of the past century—the philosophies of [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], German [[existentialism]], and [[psychoanalysis]]—had their beginnings in Hegel."&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Merleau-Ponty (trans. Herbert L. and Patricia Allen Dreyfus), ''Sense and Nonsense'', Northwestern University Press, 1964, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
=== Early years ===
==== Childhood ====
[[File:Stuttgart-Hegel-Birthplace-2006-04-09a.jpg|thumb|left|The birthplace of Hegel in [[Stuttgart]], which now houses the Hegel Museum]]
He was born on August 27, 1770 in [[Stuttgart]], capital of the [[Duchy of Württemberg]] in southwestern Germany. Christened Georg Wilhelm Friedrich, he was known as Wilhelm to his close family. His father, Georg Ludwig, was ''Rentkammersekretär'' (secretary to the revenue office) at the court of [[Karl Eugen, Duke of Württemberg]].&lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|2–3, 745}} Hegel's mother, Maria Magdalena Louisa (née Fromm), was the daughter of a lawyer at the High Court of Justice at the Württemberg court. She died of a "bilious fever" (''Gallenfieber'') when Hegel was thirteen. Hegel and his father also caught the disease, but they narrowly survived.&lt;ref&gt;Pinkard, ''Hegel: A Biography'', p. 3, incorrectly gives the date as September 20, 1781, and describes Hegel as aged eleven. Cf. the index to Pinkard's book and his "Chronology of Hegel's Life", which correctly give the date as 1783 (pp. 773, 745); see also [[:de:Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel#Studien und Interessen|German Wikipedia]].&lt;/ref&gt; Hegel had a sister, Christiane Luise (1773–1832); and a brother, Georg Ludwig (1776–1812), who was to perish as an officer in Napoleon's Russian campaign of 1812.&lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|4}}

At the age of three, he went to the German School. When he entered the Latin School two years later, he already knew the [[first declension]], having been taught it by his mother. In 1776, he entered Stuttgart's ''[[gymnasium illustre]]'' and during his adolescence read voraciously, copying lengthy extracts in his diary. Authors he read include the poet [[Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock]] and writers associated with the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], such as [[Christian Garve]] and [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]]. His studies at the ''Gymnasium'' were concluded with his ''[[Abitur]]rede'' ("graduation speech") entitled "The abortive state of art and scholarship in Turkey"&lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|16}} ("den verkümmerten Zustand der Künste und Wissenschaften unter den Türken").&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Rosenkranz]], ''Hegels Leben'', Duncker und Humblot, 1844, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Tübingen (1788–1793) ====
At the age of eighteen, Hegel entered the [[Tübinger Stift]] (a Protestant seminary attached to the [[University of Tübingen]]), where he had as roommates the poet and philosopher [[Friedrich Hölderlin]] and the philosopher-to-be [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge Companion to Hegel |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N1ohAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover | editor=[[Frederick C. Beiser|Beiser, Frederick C.]] |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=1993 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=N1ohAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT419&amp;dq=%22Hegel%22%22Tübinger+Stift.+1789–1790+shares+a+roomwith+Hölderlin+and+Schelling+and+forms+friendship+with+them%22 419]| id={{ISBN|1-13982495-3}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharing a dislike for what they regarded as the restrictive environment of the Seminary, the three became close friends and mutually influenced each other's ideas. All greatly admired Hellenic civilization and Hegel additionally steeped himself in [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and Lessing during this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harris|first=H.S.|title=Phenomenology and System|date=1995|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; They watched the unfolding of the [[French Revolution]] with shared enthusiasm. Schelling and Hölderlin immersed themselves in theoretical debates on [[Kantian philosophy]], from which Hegel remained aloof. Hegel at this time envisaged his future as that of a ''Popularphilosoph'', i.e. a "man of letters" who serves to make the abstruse ideas of philosophers accessible to a wider public; his own felt need to engage critically with the central ideas of Kantianism did not come until 1800. 

Although the violence of the [[Reign of Terror]] in 1793 dampened Hegel's hopes, he continued to identify with the moderate [[Girondin]] faction and never lost his commitment to the principles of 1789, which he would express by drinking a toast to the [[storming of the Bastille]] every fourteenth of July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Good |first1=James Allan |title=A Search for Unity in Diversity: The "Permanent Hegelian Deposit" in the Philosophy of John Dewey |date=2006 |publisher=Lexington Books |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==== Bern (1793–1796) and Frankfurt (1797–1801) ====
Having received his theological certificate (''[[consistory (Protestantism)|Konsistorial]]examen'') from the Tübingen Seminary, Hegel became ''Hofmeister'' (house tutor) to an aristocratic family in [[Bern]] (1793–1796). During this period, he composed the text which has become known as the ''[[Life of Jesus (Hegel)|Life of Jesus]]'' and a book-length manuscript titled "The Positivity of the Christian Religion". His relations with his employers becoming strained. Hegel accepted an offer mediated by Hölderlin to take up a similar position with a wine merchant's family in [[Frankfurt]], where he moved in 1797. Here, Hölderlin exerted an important influence on Hegel's thought.&lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|80}} While in Frankfurt, Hegel composed the essay "Fragments on Religion and Love".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www3.documenta.de/research/assets/Uploads/Hegel-Fragment-on-Love.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008103100/http://www3.documenta.de/research/assets/Uploads/Hegel-Fragment-on-Love.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1799, he wrote another essay entitled "The Spirit of Christianity and Its Fate",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sunypress.edu/pdf/60921.pdf The Spirit of Christianity and Its Fate"]&lt;/ref&gt; unpublished during his lifetime.

Also in 1797, the unpublished and unsigned manuscript of "[[The Oldest Systematic Program of German Idealism]]" was written. It was written in Hegel's hand, but thought to have been authored by either Hegel, Schelling, Hölderlin, or an unknown fourth person.&lt;ref name="Hammermeister"&gt;Kai Hammermeister, ''The German Aesthetic Tradition'', Cambridge University Press, 2002, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Career years ===
==== Jena, Bamberg and Nuremberg (1801–1816) ====
In 1801, Hegel came to [[Jena]] with the encouragement of his old friend Schelling, who held the position of Extraordinary Professor at the [[University of Jena|University]] there. Hegel secured a position at the University as a ''[[Privatdozent]]'' (unsalaried lecturer) after submitting an [[inaugural dissertation]] on the orbits of the planets.&lt;ref&gt;The title of Hegel's thesis was ''Dissertatio Philosophica de Orbitis Planetarium'' (''Philosophical Dissertation on the Orbits of the Planets''); published, with a German translation by Wolgang Neuser, as ''Dissertatio Philosophica de Orbitis Planetarium / Philosophische erörterung über die Planetenbahnen'', Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the year, Hegel's first book ''[[The Difference Between Fichte's and Schelling's Systems of Philosophy]]'' was completed. He lectured on "Logic and Metaphysics" and gave joint lectures with Schelling on an "Introduction to the Idea and Limits of True Philosophy" and held a "Philosophical Disputorium". In 1802, Schelling and Hegel founded a journal, the ''Kritische Journal der Philosophie'' (''Critical Journal of Philosophy''), to which they each contributed pieces until the collaboration was ended when Schelling left for [[Würzburg]] in 1803.

In 1805, the University promoted Hegel to the position of Extraordinary Professor (unsalaried) after he wrote a letter to the poet and minister of culture [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]] protesting at the promotion of his philosophical adversary [[Jakob Friedrich Fries]] ahead of him.&lt;ref name=pinkard&gt;{{cite book|last=Pinkard|first=Terry|title=Hegel: A Biography|date=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-49679-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|223}} Hegel attempted to enlist the help of the poet and translator [[Johann Heinrich Voß]] to obtain a post at the newly renascent [[University of Heidelberg]], but he failed; to his chagrin, Fries was later in the same year made Ordinary Professor (salaried) there.&lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|224–25}}

[[File:Hegel-and-Napoleon-in-Jena-1806.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|"Hegel and Napoleon in Jena" (illustration from ''Harper's Magazine'', 1895), whose meeting became proverbial due to Hegel's notable use of ''[[Weltseele]]'' ("world-soul") in reference to Napoleon ("the world-soul on horseback", ''{{lang|de|die Weltseele zu Pferde}}'')&lt;ref&gt;Note that ''Weltseele zu Pferde'' is a shortened paraphrase of Hegel's words in the letter. The letter was not published in Hegel's time, but the expression was attributed to Hegel anecdotally, appearing in print from 1859 (L. Noack, ''Schelling und die Philosophie der Romantik'', 1859, [https://books.google.ch/books?id=7NO__b_nwrsC&amp;pg=PA153 p. 153]). It is used without attribution by [[Meyer Kayserling]] in his ''Sephardim'' (1859:103), and is apparently not recognized as a reference to Hegel by the reviewer in ''Göttingische gelehrte Anzeigen'' 2 (1861) [https://books.google.ch/books?id=4zBFAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA770  p. 770], who notes it disapprovingly, as one of Kayserling's "bad jokes" (''schlechte Witze''). The phrase become widely associated with Hegel later in the 19th century, e.g. G. Baur in ''Reden gehalten in der Aula der Universität Leipzig beim Rectoratswechsel am 31. October 1874'' (1874), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=INxiAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA36#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 36].&lt;/ref&gt;]]
With his finances drying up quickly, Hegel was now under great pressure to deliver his book, the long-promised introduction to his System. Hegel was putting the finishing touches to this book, ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]'', as Napoleon engaged Prussian troops on 14 October 1806 in the [[Battle of Jena]] on a plateau outside the city. On the day before the battle, Napoleon entered the city of Jena. Hegel recounted his impressions in a letter to his friend [[Friedrich Immanuel Niethammer]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;I saw the Emperor – this world-soul [''[[Weltseele]]''] – riding out of the city on reconnaissance. It is indeed a wonderful sensation to see such an individual, who, concentrated here at a single point, astride a horse, reaches out over the world and masters it.&lt;ref&gt;''{{lang|de|den Kaiser – diese Weltseele – sah ich durch die Stadt zum Rekognoszieren hinausreiten; es ist in der Tat eine wunderbare Empfindung, ein solches Individuum zu sehen, das hier auf einen Punkt kontentriert, auf einem Pferde sitzend, über die Welt übergreift und sie beherrscht.}}''Hegel, letter of  13 October 1806  to F. I. Niethammer,  no. 74 (p. 119) in ''Briefe von und an Hegel'' ed. Hoffmeister, vol. 1 (1970), cited after H. Schnädelbach in Wolfgang Welsch, Klaus Vieweg (eds.), ''Das Interesse des Denkens: Hegel aus heutiger Sicht'', Wilhelm Fink Verlag (2003),  [https://books.google.ch/books?id=NrkPdUO5VRsC&amp;pg=PA233  p. 223]; trans. Pinkard (2000:228).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Pinkard (2000) notes that Hegel's comment to Niethammer "is all the more striking since at that point he had already composed the crucial section of the ''Phenomenology'' in which he remarked that the [[French Revolution|Revolution]] had now officially passed to another land (Germany) that would complete 'in thought' what the Revolution had only partially accomplished in practice".&lt;ref&gt;Pinkard (2000:228f).&lt;/ref&gt; Although Napoleon chose not to close down Jena as he had other universities, the city was devastated and students deserted the university in droves, making Hegel's financial prospects even worse. The following February, Hegel's landlady Christiana Burkhardt (who had been abandoned by her husband) gave birth to their son Georg Ludwig Friedrich Fischer (1807–1831).&lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|192}}

In March 1807, Hegel moved to [[Bamberg]], where Niethammer had declined and passed on to Hegel an offer to become editor of a newspaper, the ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Bamberger Zeitung|de}}''. Unable to find more suitable employment, Hegel reluctantly accepted. Ludwig Fischer and his mother (whom Hegel may have offered to marry following the death of her husband) stayed behind in Jena.&lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|238}}

In November 1808, Hegel was again through Niethammer, appointed headmaster of a ''Gymnasium'' in [[Nuremberg]], a post he held until 1816. While in Nuremberg, Hegel adapted his recently published ''Phenomenology of Spirit'' for use in the classroom. Part of his remit being to teach a class called "Introduction to Knowledge of the Universal Coherence of the Sciences", Hegel developed the idea of an encyclopedia of the philosophical sciences, falling into three parts (logic, philosophy of nature and philosophy of spirit).&lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|337}}

In 1811, Hegel married Marie Helena Susanna von Tucher (1791–1855), the eldest daughter of a Senator. This period saw the publication of his second major work, the ''Science of Logic'' (''Wissenschaft der Logik''; 3 vols., 1812, 1813 and 1816), and the birth of his two legitimate sons, [[Karl von Hegel|Karl Friedrich Wilhelm]] (1813–1901) and Immanuel Thomas Christian (1814–1891).

==== Heidelberg and Berlin (1816–1831) ====
Having received offers of a post from the Universities of [[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg|Erlangen]], [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]] and [[Heidelberg University|Heidelberg]], Hegel chose Heidelberg, where he moved in 1816. Soon after, his illegitimate son Ludwig Fischer (now ten years old) joined the Hegel household in April 1817, having thus far spent his childhood in an orphanage&lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|354–55}} as his mother had died in the meantime.&lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|356}}

Hegel published ''The Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences in Outline'' (1817) as a summary of his philosophy for students attending his lectures at Heidelberg.

[[File:Friedrich Hegel mit Studenten Lithographie F Kugler.jpg|thumb|Hegel with his Berlin students&lt;br&gt;Sketch by Franz Kugler]]
In 1818, Hegel accepted the renewed offer of the chair of philosophy at the University of Berlin, which had remained vacant since [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]]'s death in 1814. Here, Hegel published his ''Philosophy of Right'' (1821). Hegel devoted himself primarily to delivering his lectures; and his lecture courses on aesthetics, the philosophy of religion, the philosophy of history and the history of philosophy were published posthumously from lecture notes taken by his students. His fame spread and his lectures attracted students from all over Germany and beyond.

In 1819–1827, he made several trips to [[Weimar]] (twice), where he met Goethe, [[Brussels]], the [[Northern Netherlands]], [[Leipzig]], [[Vienna]] through [[Prague]] and [[Paris]].&lt;ref name="Siep xxii"&gt;Ludwig Siep, ''Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit'', Cambridge University Press, 2014, p. xxi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel was appointed [[Rector (academia)|Rector]] of the University in October 1829, but his term as Rector ended in September 1830. Hegel was deeply disturbed by the riots for reform in Berlin in that year. In 1831, [[Frederick William III of Prussia|Frederick William III]] decorated him with the [[Order of the Red Eagle]], 3rd Class for his service to the Prussian state.&lt;ref name="Siep xxii"/&gt; In August 1831, a [[cholera]] epidemic reached Berlin and Hegel left the city, taking up lodgings in [[Kreuzberg]]. Now in a weak state of health, Hegel seldom went out. As the new semester began in October, Hegel returned to Berlin with the (mistaken) impression that the epidemic had largely subsided. By November 14, Hegel was dead. The physicians pronounced the cause of death as cholera, but it is likely he died from a different gastrointestinal disease. He is said to have uttered the last words "And he didn't understand me" before expiring.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Davies, ''[[Europe: A History]]'', 1996, p. 687.&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with his wishes, Hegel was buried on November 16 in the [[Dorotheenstadt cemetery]] next to Fichte and [[Karl Wilhelm Ferdinand Solger]].

Hegel's son Ludwig Fischer had died shortly before while serving with the Dutch army in [[Jakarta|Batavia]] and the news of his death never reached his father.&lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|548}} Early the following year, Hegel's sister Christiane committed suicide by drowning. Hegel's remaining two sons—[[Karl von Hegel|Karl]], who became a historian; and {{Interlanguage link multi|Immanuel Hegel|de|3=Immanuel Hegel|lt=Immanuel}}, who followed a theological path—lived long and safeguarded their father's ''[[Nachlaß]]'' and produced editions of his works.

== Philosophical work ==
{{Hegelianism}}

=== Freedom ===
Hegel's thinking can be understood as a constructive development within the broad tradition that includes [[Plato]] and [[Immanuel Kant]]. To this list, one could add [[Proclus]], [[Meister Eckhart]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], [[Plotinus]], [[Jakob Böhme]], and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. What all these thinkers share, which distinguishes them from [[materialists]] like [[Epicurus]] and [[Thomas Hobbes]] and from [[empiricists]] like [[David Hume]], is that they regard freedom or self-determination both as real and as having important [[ontology|ontological]] implications for soul or mind or divinity. This focus on freedom is what generates Plato's notion (in the ''[[Phaedo]]'', ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' and ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'') of the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] as having a higher or fuller kind of reality than inanimate objects possess. While [[Aristotle]] criticizes Plato's "Forms", he preserves Plato's cornerstones of the ontological implications for self-determination: ethical reasoning, the soul's pinnacle in the hierarchy of nature, the order of the cosmos and an assumption with reasoned arguments for a prime mover. Kant imports Plato's high esteem of individual sovereignty to his considerations of moral and noumenal freedom as well as to God. All three find common ground on the unique position of humans in the scheme of things, known by the discussed categorical differences from animals and inanimate objects.

In his discussion of "Spirit" in his ''Encyclopedia'', Hegel praises Aristotle's ''[[On the Soul]]'' as "by far the most admirable, perhaps even the sole, work of philosophical value on this topic".&lt;ref&gt;par. 378&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit|Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' and his ''[[Science of Logic]]'', Hegel's concern with Kantian topics such as freedom and morality and with their ontological implications is pervasive. Rather than simply rejecting Kant's dualism of freedom versus nature, Hegel aims to subsume it within "true infinity", the "Concept" (or "Notion": ''Begriff''), "Spirit" and "ethical life" in such a way that the Kantian duality is rendered intelligible, rather than remaining a brute "given".

The reason why this subsumption takes place in a series of concepts is that Hegel's method in his ''Science of Logic'' and his ''Encyclopedia'' is to begin with basic concepts like "Being" and "Nothing" and to develop these through a long sequence of elaborations, including those already mentioned. In this manner, a solution that is reached in principle in the account of "true infinity" in the ''Science of Logic'''s chapter on "Quality" is repeated in new guises at later stages, all the way to "Spirit" and "ethical life" in the third volume of the ''Encyclopedia''.

In this way, Hegel intends to defend the germ of truth in Kantian dualism against reductive or eliminative programs like those of materialism and empiricism. Like Plato, with his dualism of soul versus bodily appetites, Kant pursues the mind's ability to question its felt inclinations or appetites and to come up with a standard of "duty" (or, in Plato's case, "good") which transcends bodily restrictiveness. Hegel preserves this essential Platonic and Kantian concern in the form of infinity going beyond the finite (a process that Hegel in fact relates to "freedom" and the "ought"),&lt;ref name=miller&gt;See ''Science of Logic'', trans. Miller [Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities, 1989]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|133–136, 138}} the universal going beyond the particular (in the Concept) and Spirit going beyond Nature. Hegel renders these dualities intelligible by (ultimately) his argument in the "Quality" chapter of the "Science of Logic". The finite has to become infinite in order to achieve reality. The idea of the absolute excludes multiplicity so the subjective and objective must achieve synthesis to become whole. This is because as Hegel suggests by his introduction of the concept of "reality",&lt;ref name=miller/&gt;{{rp|111}} what determines itself—rather than depending on its relations to other things for its essential character—is more fully "real" (following the Latin etymology of "real", more "thing-like") than what does not. Finite things do not determine themselves because as "finite" things their essential character is determined by their boundaries over against other finite things, so in order to become "real" they must go beyond their finitude ("finitude is only as a transcending of itself").&lt;ref name=miller/&gt;{{rp|145}}

The result of this argument is that finite and infinite—and by extension, particular and universal, nature and freedom—do not face one another as two independent realities, but instead the latter (in each case) is the self-transcending of the former.&lt;ref name=miller/&gt;{{rp|146}} Rather than stress the distinct singularity of each factor that complements and conflicts with others—without explanation—the relationship between finite and infinite (and particular and universal and nature and freedom) becomes intelligible as a progressively developing and self-perfecting whole.

=== Progress ===
The mystical writings of [[Jakob Böhme]] had a strong effect on Hegel.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jon Mills (psychologist)|Jon Mills]], ''The Unconscious Abyss: Hegel's Anticipation of Psychoanalysis'', SUNY Press, 2002, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Böhme had written that the [[Fall of Man]] was a necessary stage in the [[evolution]] of the [[universe]]. This evolution was itself the result of God's desire for complete self-awareness. Hegel was fascinated by the works of Kant, Rousseau and [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]] and by the [[French Revolution]]. Modern philosophy, culture and society seemed to Hegel fraught with contradictions and tensions, such as those between the subject and object of knowledge, mind and nature, [[Philosophy of self|self]] and [[Other (philosophy)|Other]], freedom and authority, knowledge and faith, or the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and [[Romanticism]]. Hegel's main philosophical project was to take these contradictions and tensions and interpret them as part of a comprehensive, evolving, rational unity that in different contexts he called "the absolute Idea" (''[[Science of Logic]]'', sections 1781–1783) or "absolute knowledge" (''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'', "(DD) Absolute Knowledge").

According to Hegel, the main characteristic of this unity was that it evolved through and manifested itself in [[contradiction]] and negation. Contradiction and negation have a dynamic quality that at every point in each domain of [[reality]]—[[consciousness]], history, philosophy, art, nature and society—leads to further development until a [[rationality|rational]] unity is reached that preserves the contradictions as phases and sub-parts by lifting them up (''[[Aufheben|Aufhebung]]'') to a higher unity. This whole is mental because it is mind that can comprehend all of these phases and sub-parts as steps in its own process of comprehension. It is rational because the same, underlying, [[logic]]al, developmental order underlies every domain of reality and is ultimately the order of self-conscious rational thought, although only in the later stages of development does it come to full self-consciousness. The rational, self-conscious [[wikt:whole|whole]] is not a thing or [[being]] that lies outside of other existing things or minds. Rather, it comes to completion only in the philosophical comprehension of individual existing human minds who through their own understanding bring this developmental process to an understanding of itself. Hegel's thought is revolutionary to the extent that it is a philosophy of absolute negation—as long as absolute negation is at the center, systematization remains open, and makes it possible for human beings to become subjects.&lt;ref name="Schroeder2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Schroeder|title=Between Freedom and Necessity: An Essay on the Place of Value|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JfT6aQvkVfAC&amp;pg=PA104|accessdate=2012-12-17|year=2000|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=978-90-420-1302-5|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Mind" and "Spirit" are the common English translations of Hegel's use of the German "[[Geist]]". Some{{Who|date=December 2012}} have argued that either of these terms overly "psychologize" Hegel,{{citation needed|date=February 2007}} implying a kind of disembodied, solipsistic consciousness like [[ghost]] or "soul". Geist combines the meaning of spirit—as in god, ghost, or mind—with an intentional force. In Hegel's early philosophy of nature (draft manuscripts written during his time at the University of Jena), Hegel's notion of "Geist" was tightly bound to the notion of "[[Aether (classical element)|Aether]]", from which Hegel also derived the concepts of [[space]] and [[time]], but in his later works (after Jena) he did not explicitly use his old notion of "Aether" anymore.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Gruner: "Hegel's Aether Doctrine", [[VDM Publishing|VDM Publ]]., 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-639-28451-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Central to Hegel's [[Conception (idea)|conception]] of [[knowledge]] and mind (and therefore also of reality) was the notion of [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]] in [[Subtraction|difference]]—that is, that mind [[Externalization|externalizes]] itself in various forms and [[object (philosophy)|object]]s that stand outside of it or opposed to it; and that through recognizing itself in them, is "with itself" in these external manifestations so that they are at one and the same time mind and other-than-mind. This notion of identity in difference, which is intimately bound up with his conception of contradiction and negativity, is a principal feature differentiating Hegel's thought from that of other philosophers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

=== Civil society ===
{{see also|Civil society}}
Hegel made the distinction between civil society and state in his ''[[Elements of the Philosophy of Right]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/preface.htm|title=Hegel's Philosophy of Right: Preface|first=|last=Hegel, G. W. F.|website=www.marxists.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this work, civil society (Hegel used the term "''bürgerliche Gesellschaft''" though it is now referred to as ''Zivilgesellschaft'' in German to emphasize a more inclusive community) was a stage in the [[dialectical|dialectical relationship]] that occurs between Hegel's perceived opposites, the macro-community of the [[State (polity)|state]] and the micro-community of the family.&lt;ref&gt;Pelczynski, A.Z.; 1984; 'The Significance of Hegel's separation of the state and civil society' pp1-13 in Pelczynski, A.Z. (ed.); 1984; ''The State and Civil Society''; Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Broadly speaking, the term was split, like Hegel's followers, to the [[political left]] and [[political right|right]]. On the left, it became the foundation for [[Karl Marx]]'s civil society as an [[base and superstructure|economic base]];&lt;ref name="glob"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Zaleski | first = Pawel | authorlink = | title = Tocqueville on Civilian Society. A Romantic Vision of the Dichotomic Structure of Social Reality | journal = Archiv für Begriffsgeschichte | volume = 50 | issue = | pages = | publisher = Felix Meiner Verlag | location = | year = 2008 | url = | doi = | id = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; to the right, it became a description for all non-state (and the state is the peak of the objective spirit) aspects of society, including culture, society and politics. This liberal distinction between [[political society]] and [[civil society]] was followed by [[Alexis de Tocqueville]].&lt;ref name="glob" /&gt; In fact, Hegel's distinctions as to what he meant by civil society are often unclear. For example, while it seems to be the case that he felt that a civil society such as the German society in which he lived was an inevitable movement of the dialectic, he made way for the crushing of other types of "lesser" and not fully realized types of civil society as these societies were not fully conscious or aware—as it were—as to the lack of progress in their societies. Thus, it was perfectly legitimate in the eyes of Hegel for a conqueror such as Napoleon to come along and destroy that which was not fully realized.

=== State ===
Hegel's State is the final culmination of the embodiment of freedom or right (''Rechte'') in the ''[[Elements of the Philosophy of Right]].'' The State subsumes family and civil society and fulfills them. All three together are called "ethical life" (''[[Sittlichkeit]]''). The State involves three "[[wikt:moment#Noun|moments]]". In a Hegelian State, citizens both know their place and choose their place. They both know their obligations and choose to fulfill their obligations. An individual's "supreme duty is to be a member of the state" (''Elements of the Philosophy of Right'', section 258). The individual has "substantial freedom in the state". The State is "objective spirit" so "it is only through being a member of the state that the individual himself has objectivity, truth, and ethical life" (section 258). Furthermore, every member both loves the State with genuine patriotism, but has transcended mere "team spirit" by reflectively endorsing their citizenship. Members of a Hegelian State are happy even to sacrifice their lives for the State.

=== Heraclitus ===
According to Hegel, "[[Heraclitus]] is the one who first declared the nature of the infinite and first grasped nature as in itself infinite, that is, its essence as process. The origin of philosophy is to be dated from Heraclitus. His is the persistent Idea that is the same in all philosophers up to the present day, as it was the Idea of Plato and Aristotle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hegel, G. W. F.|title=Vorlesungen über die Geschichte der Philosophie|year=1979|pages=336–337|url=http://www.zeno.org/Philosophie/M/Hegel,+Georg+Wilhelm+Friedrich/Vorlesungen+%C3%BCber+die+Geschichte+der+Philosophie/Erster+Teil%3A+Griechische+Philosophie/Erster+Abschnitt.+Von+Thales+bis+Aristoteles/Erstes+Kapitel.+Von+Thales+bis+Anaxagoras/D.+Philosophie+des+Heraklit | accessdate=2008-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Hegel, Heraclitus's great achievements were to have understood the nature of the infinite, which for Hegel includes understanding the inherent contradictoriness and negativity of reality; and to have grasped that reality is becoming or process and that "being" and "nothingness" are mere empty abstractions. According to Hegel, Heraclitus's "obscurity" comes from his being a true (in Hegel's terms "speculative") philosopher who grasped the ultimate philosophical truth and therefore expressed himself in a way that goes beyond the abstract and limited nature of common sense and is difficult to grasp by those who operate within common sense. Hegel asserted that in Heraclitus he had an antecedent for his logic: "[...] there is no proposition of Heraclitus which I have not adopted in my logic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Justus | last=Hartnack |others=Lars Aagaard-Mogensen (trans.) | title=An Introduction to Hegel's Logic | year=1998 | publisher=Hackett Publishing | isbn=0-87220-424-3| pages=16–17}} Hartnack quotes Hegel, ''Lectures on the History of Philosophy'', Volume I.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel cites a number of fragments of Heraclitus in his ''Lectures on the History of Philosophy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Hegel, G. W. F. | title=Vorlesungen über die Geschichte der Philosophie | year=1979 | pages=319–343 | url=http://www.zeno.org/Philosophie/M/Hegel,+Georg+Wilhelm+Friedrich/Vorlesungen+%C3%BCber+die+Geschichte+der+Philosophie/Erster+Teil%3A+Griechische+Philosophie/Erster+Abschnitt.+Von+Thales+bis+Aristoteles/Erstes+Kapitel.+Von+Thales+bis+Anaxagoras/D.+Philosophie+des+Heraklit | accessdate=2008-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; One to which he attributes great significance is the fragment he translates as "Being is not more than Non-being", which he interprets to mean the following: &lt;blockquote&gt;''Sein und Nichts sei dasselbe''&lt;br&gt;Being and non-being are the same.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Heraclitus does not form any abstract nouns from his ordinary use of "to be" and "to become" and in that fragment seems to be opposing any identity A to any other identity B, C and so on, which is not-A. However, Hegel interprets not-A as not existing at all, not nothing at all, which cannot be conceived, but indeterminate or "pure" [[being]] without [[particular]]ity or specificity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Frederick Charles | last=Copleston | pages=Chapter X | year=2003 | publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group | isbn=0-8264-6901-9 | nopp=true | title=A History of Philosophy: Volume 7: 18th and 19th century German philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pure being and pure non-being or nothingness are for Hegel pure abstractions from the reality of becoming and this is also how he interprets Heraclitus. This interpretation of Heraclitus cannot be ruled out, but even if present is not the main gist of his thought.

For Hegel, the inner movement of reality is the process of God thinking as manifested in the evolution of the universe of nature and thought; that is, Hegel argued that when fully and properly understood, [[reality]] is being [[Idealism|thought]] by God as manifested in a person's comprehension of this process in and through philosophy. Since human thought is the image and fulfillment of God's thought, God is not [[Ineffability|ineffable]] (so incomprehensible as to be unutterable), but can be understood by an analysis of thought and reality. Just as humans continually correct their concepts of reality through a [[dialectic|dialectical process]], so God himself becomes more fully manifested through the dialectical process of becoming.

For his god, Hegel does not take the logos of Heraclitus but refers rather to the [[nous]] of [[Anaxagoras]], although he may well have regarded them the same as he continues to refer to god's plan, which is identical to God. Whatever the nous thinks at any time is actual [[Substance theory|substance]] and is identical to limited being, but more remains to be thought in the substrate of non-being, which is identical to pure or unlimited thought.

The universe as becoming is therefore a combination of being and non-being. The particular is never complete in itself, but to find completion is continually transformed into more comprehensive, complex, self-relating particulars. The essential nature of being-for-itself is that it is free "in itself;" that is, it does not depend on anything else such as matter for its being. The limitations represent fetters, which it must constantly be casting off as it becomes freer and more self-determining.&lt;ref&gt;The notable Introduction to ''Philosophy of History'' expresses the historical aspects of the dialectic.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Hegel began his philosophizing with commentary on the Christian religion and often expresses the view that he is a Christian, his ideas of God are not acceptable to some Christians even though he has had a major influence on 19th- and 20th-century theology.

=== Religion ===
As a graduate of a Protestant seminary, Hegel's theological concerns were reflected in many of his writings and lectures.&lt;ref&gt;"[T]he task that touches the interest of philosophy most nearly at the present moment: to put God back at the peak of philosophy, absolutely prior to all else as the one and only ground of everything." (Hegel, "How the Ordinary Human Understanding Takes Philosophy as displayed in the works of Mr. Krug", ''Kritisches Journal der Philosophie'', I, no. 1, 1802, pages&amp;nbsp;91–115)&lt;/ref&gt; Hegel's thoughts on the person of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] stood out from the theologies of the Enlightenment. In his posthumously published ''[[Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion]], Part 3'', Hegel is shown as being particularly interested with the demonstrations of God's existence and the ontological proof.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Bartley Stewart. 2008. ''[[Johan Ludvig Heiberg (poet)|Johan Ludvig Heiberg]]: Philosopher, Littérateur, Dramaturge, and Political Thinker.'' Museum Tusculanum Press. p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; He espouses that "God is not an abstraction but a concrete God&amp;nbsp;[...] God, considered in terms of his eternal Idea, has to generate the Son, has to distinguish himself from himself; he is the process of differentiating, namely, love and Spirit". This means that Jesus as the Son of God is posited by God over against himself as other. Hegel sees both a relational unity and a metaphysical unity between Jesus and God the Father. To Hegel, Jesus is both divine and human. Hegel further attests that God (as Jesus) not only died, but "[...]&amp;nbsp;rather, a reversal takes place: God, that is to say, maintains himself in the process, and the latter is only the death of death. God rises again to life, and thus things are reversed".

The philosopher [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] has argued that there was great stress on the sharp criticisms of traditional Christianity appearing in Hegel's so-called early theological writings. Kaufmann admits that Hegel treated many distinctively Christian themes and "sometimes could not resist equating" his conception of spirit (Geist) "with God, instead of saying clearly: in God I do not believe; spirit suffices me".&lt;ref&gt;Walter Kaufmann, ''Hegel: Reinterpretation, Texts, and Commentary'', Garden City, New York: Doubleday &amp; Company, 1965, pp. 276–77&lt;/ref&gt; Kaufmann also points out that Hegel's references to God or to the divine—and also to spirit—drew on classical Greek as well as Christian connotations of the terms. Kaufmann goes on:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In addition to his beloved Greeks, Hegel saw before him the example of Spinoza and, in his own time, the poetry of Goethe, Schiller, and Hölderlin, who also liked to speak of gods and the divine. So he, too, sometimes spoke of God and, more often, of the divine; and because he occasionally took pleasure in insisting that he was really closer to this or that Christian tradition than some of the theologians of his time, he has sometimes been understood to have been a Christian.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]], ''Hegel: Reinterpretation, Texts, and Commentary'', Garden City, New York: Doubleday &amp; Company, 1965, p. 277&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Hegel himself, his philosophy was consistent with Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Bartley Stewart. 2008. Johan Ludvig Heiberg: Philosopher, Littérateur, Dramaturge, and Political Thinker. Museum Tusculanum Press. p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; This led Hegelian philosopher, jurist and politician {{Interlanguage link multi|Carl Friedrich Göschel|de}} (1784–1861) to write a treatise demonstrating the consistency of Hegel's philosophy with the Christian doctrine of the immortality of the human soul. Göschel's book on this subject was titled ''Von den Beweisen für die Unsterblichkeit der menschlichen Seele im Lichte der spekulativen Philosophie: eine Ostergabe'' (Berlin: Verlag von Duncker und Humblot, 1835).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reader.digitale-sammlungen.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb10043317_00005.html|title=MDZ-Reader  - Band  - Von den Beweisen für die Unsterblichkeit der menschlichen Seele im Lichte der spekulativen Philosophie / Göschel, Carl Friedrich|website=reader.digitale-sammlungen.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the 1870s and 1880s, Rev. T. R. Vickroy and Susan E. Blow - who were both minor associates of the St. Louis Hegelians - independently of each other translated various chapters from Göschel's book into English, and had their translations published in ''The Journal of Speculative Philosophy''. ''The Journal of Speculative Philosophy'' (in print from 1867-1893) was the official journal of the St. Louis Philosophical Society. The St. Louis Philosophical Society - the organization which served as the hub of the St. Louis Hegelians - had been co-founded in January 1866 by 2 disciples of Hegel in America, William Torrey Harris (1835-1909) and [[Henry Conrad Brokmeyer]] (1826-1906). Rev. Thomas Rhys Vickroy (December 27, 1833 - April 19, 1904), a minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church, had been the first president (1866-1871) of Lebanon Valley College in Annville, Lebanon County, Pennsylvania. While President at Lebanon Valley College, Vickroy also held various professorships there. For example, one year he was Professor of Philosophy and the Greek Language and Literature, and another year he was Professor of Belles-Lettres and Philosophy. Susan Elizabeth Blow (June 7, 1843 - March 27, 1916) was an educator who in 1873 opened the first successful public kindergarten in the U. S. - in the Des Peres School, in the Carondelet neighborhood of St. Louis, Missouri.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jon Bartley Stewart. 2008. ''Johan Ludvig Heiberg: Philosopher, Littérateur, Dramaturge, and Political Thinker''. Museum Tusculanum Press. p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel seemed to have an ambivalent relationship with [[Magic (supernatural)|magic]], [[myth]] and [[Paganism]]. He formulates an early philosophical example of a [[disenchantment]] narrative, arguing that Judaism was responsible both for realizing the existence of ''Geist'' and, by extension, for separating nature from ideas of spiritual and magical forces and challenging [[polytheism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |page = 85-6 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 0-226-40336-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hegel's manuscript "[[The Oldest Systematic Program of German Idealism]]" suggests that Hegel was concerned about the perceived decline in myth and enchantment in his age, and that he therefore called for a "new myth" to fill the cultural vacuum.&lt;ref&gt;Josephson-Storm (2017), p. 85-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Works ==
Hegel published four works during his lifetime:&lt;br&gt;
(1) ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' (or ''The Phenomenology of Mind''), his account of the evolution of consciousness from sense-perception to absolute knowledge, published in 1807.

(2) ''[[Science of Logic]]'', the logical and [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] core of his philosophy, in three volumes (1812, 1813 and 1816, respectively), with a revised first volume published in 1831.

(3) ''[[Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences]]'', a summary of his entire philosophical system, which was originally published in 1816 and revised in 1827 and 1830.

(4) ''[[Elements of the Philosophy of Right]]'', his political philosophy, published in 1820.

During the last ten years of his life, Hegel did not publish another book, but thoroughly revised the ''Encyclopedia'' (second edition, 1827; third, 1830).&lt;ref&gt;W. Kaufmann (1980), ''Discovery of the Mind 1: Goethe, Kant and Hegel'', p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; In his political philosophy, he criticized [[Karl Ludwig von Haller]]'s reactionary work, which claimed that laws were not necessary. He also published some articles early in his career and during his Berlin period. A number of other works on the [[philosophy of history]], [[Philosophy of religion|religion]], [[aesthetics]] and the [[history of philosophy]] were compiled from the lecture notes of his students and published posthumously.

{{see also|Hegelianism}}
There are views of Hegel's thought as a representation of the summit of early 19th-century Germany's movement of philosophical [[idealism]]. It would come to have a profound impact on many future philosophical schools, including schools that opposed Hegel's specific [[dialectical idealism]], such as [[existentialism]], the [[historical materialism]] of Marx, [[historism]] and [[British idealism|British Idealism]].

Hegel's influence was immense both within philosophy and in the other sciences. Throughout the 19th century many chairs of philosophy around Europe were held by Hegelians and [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Ludwig Feuerbach]], [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]]—among many others—were all deeply influenced by, but also strongly opposed to many of the central themes of Hegel's philosophy. Scholars continue to find and point out Hegelian influences and approaches in a wide range of theoretical and/or learned works, such as [[Carl von Clausewitz]]'s ''magnum opus'' on strategic thought, ''[[On War]]'' (1831).&lt;ref&gt;Cormier, Youri. [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07075332.2013.859166?tab=permissions#.U9etAfldXGA "Hegel and Clausewitz: Convergence on Method, Divergence on Ethics"], ''International History Review'', Volume 36, Issue 3, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; After less than a generation, Hegel's philosophy was suppressed and even banned by the [[Prussia]]n [[right-wing]] and was firmly rejected by the [[left-wing]] in multiple official writings.

After the period of [[Bruno Bauer]], Hegel's influence did not make itself felt again until the philosophy of British Idealism and the 20th-century Hegelian [[Western Marxism]] that began with [[György Lukács]]. The more recent movement of [[communitarianism]] has a strong Hegelian influence.

=== Reading Hegel ===
Some of Hegel's writing was intended for those with advanced knowledge of philosophy, although his ''Encyclopedia'' was intended as a textbook in a [[university]] [[course (education)|course]]. Nevertheless, Hegel assumes that his readers are well-versed in [[Western philosophy]]. Especially crucial are [[Aristotle]], [[Immanuel Kant]] and Kant's immediate successors, most prominently [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]]. Those without this background would be well-advised to begin with one of the many general introductions to his thought. As is always the case, difficulties are magnified for those reading him in translation. In fact, Hegel himself argues in his ''Science of Logic'' that the German language was particularly conducive to philosophical thought.&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, G.W.F. ''Science of Logic''. trans. George di Giovanni. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. 2010. p.12&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Walter Kaufmann, the basic idea of Hegel's works, especially the ''Phenomenology of Spirit'', is that a philosopher should not "confine him or herself to views that have been held but penetrate these to the human reality they reflect". In other words, it is not enough to consider propositions, or even the content of consciousness; "it is worthwhile to ask in every instance what kind of spirit would entertain such propositions, hold such views, and have such a consciousness. Every outlook in other words, is to be studied not merely as an academic possibility but as an existential reality".&lt;ref&gt;W. Kaufmann (1966), ''Hegel: A Reinterpretation'', Anchor, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Kaufmann has argued that as unlikely as it may sound, it is not the case that Hegel was unable to write clearly, but that Hegel felt that "he must and should not write in the way in which he was gifted".&lt;ref&gt;W. Kaufmann, 1966, ''Hegel: A Reinterpretation'', p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Left and right Hegelianism ===
Some historians have spoken of Hegel's influence as represented by two opposing camps. The [[Right Hegelians]], the allegedly direct disciples of Hegel at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität]], advocated a [[Protestant]] orthodoxy and the [[political conservatism]] of the post-[[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] Restoration period. The [[Young Hegelians|Left Hegelians]], also known as the Young Hegelians, interpreted Hegel in a [[revolutionary]] sense, leading to an advocation of [[atheism]] in religion and [[liberal democracy]] in politics.

In more recent studies, this paradigm has been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Löwith]], ''From Hegel to Nietzsche: The Revolution in Nineteenth-Century Thought'', translated by David E. Green, New York: Columbia University Press, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; No Hegelians of the period ever referred to themselves as "Right Hegelians", which was a term of insult originated by [[David Strauss]], a self-styled Left Hegelian. Critiques of Hegel offered from the Left Hegelians radically diverted Hegel's thinking into new directions and eventually came to form a disproportionately large part of the literature on and about Hegel.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

The Left Hegelians also influenced Marxism, which inspired global movements, encompassing the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], the [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|Chinese Revolution]] and myriad revolutionary practices up until the present moment.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

20th-century interpretations of Hegel were mostly shaped by [[British idealism]], [[logical positivism]], [[Marxism]] and [[Fascism]]. According to [[Benedetto Croce]], the [[Italian Fascist]] [[Giovanni Gentile]] "holds the honor of having been the most rigorous neo-Hegelian in the entire history of Western philosophy and the dishonor of having been the official philosopher of Fascism in Italy".&lt;ref&gt;[[Benedetto Croce]], ''Guide to Aesthetics'', Translated by Patrick Romanell, "Translator's Introduction", The Library of Liberal Arts, The Bobbs–Merrill Co., Inc., 1965&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the fall of the Soviet Union a new wave of Hegel scholarship arose in the West without the preconceptions of the prior schools of thought. {{Interlanguage link multi|Walter Jaeschke|de}} and [[Otto Pöggeler]] in Germany as well as Peter Hodgson and [[Howard Kainz]] in the United States are notable for their recent contributions to post-Soviet Union thinking about Hegel.

=== Triads ===
{{main|Thesis, antithesis, synthesis}}
In previous modern accounts of Hegelianism (to undergraduate classes, for example), especially those formed prior to the Hegel renaissance, Hegel's [[dialectic]] was most often characterized as a three-step process, "[[thesis, antithesis, synthesis]]"; namely, that a "thesis" (e.g. the [[French Revolution]]) would cause the creation of its "antithesis" (e.g. the [[Reign of Terror]] that followed) and would eventually result in a "synthesis" (e.g. the [[constitutional state]] of free citizens). However, Hegel used this classification only once and he attributed the terminology to Kant. The terminology was largely developed earlier by Fichte. It was spread by [[Heinrich Moritz Chalybäus]] in accounts of Hegelian philosophy and since then the terms have been used as descriptive of this type of framework.

The "thesis–antithesis–synthesis" approach gives the sense that things or ideas are contradicted or opposed by things that come from outside them. To the contrary, the fundamental notion of Hegel's dialectic is that things or ideas have internal contradictions. From Hegel's point of view, analysis or comprehension of a thing or idea reveals that underneath its apparently simple identity or unity is an underlying inner contradiction. This contradiction leads to the dissolution of the thing or idea in the simple form in which it presented itself and to a higher-level, more complex thing or idea that more adequately incorporates the contradiction. The triadic form that appears in many places in Hegel (e.g. being–nothingness–becoming, immediate–mediate–concrete and abstract–negative–concrete) is about this movement from inner contradiction to higher-level integration or unification.

For Hegel, reason is but "speculative", not "dialectical".&lt;ref&gt;''Hegel and Language'', edited by Jere O'Neill Surber. [https://books.google.com/books?id=HFpQHr07IAkC&amp;pg=PA238 p. 238].&lt;/ref&gt; Believing that the traditional description of Hegel's philosophy in terms of thesis–antithesis–synthesis was mistaken, a few scholars like [[Raya Dunayevskaya]] have attempted to discard the triadic approach altogether. According to their argument, although Hegel refers to "the two elemental considerations: first, the idea of freedom as the absolute and final aim; secondly, the means for realising it, i.e. the subjective side of knowledge and will, with its life, movement, and activity" (thesis and antithesis), he does not use "synthesis", but instead speaks of the "Whole": "We then recognised the State as the moral Whole and the Reality of Freedom, and consequently as the objective unity of these two elements". Furthermore, in Hegel's language the "dialectical" aspect or "moment" of thought and reality, by which things or thoughts turn into their opposites or have their inner contradictions brought to the surface, what he called ''[[Aufheben|Aufhebung]]'', is only preliminary to the "speculative" (and not "synthesizing") aspect or "moment", which grasps the unity of these opposites or contradiction.

It is widely admitted today that the old-fashioned description of Hegel's philosophy in terms of thesis–antithesis–synthesis is inaccurate. Nevertheless, such is the persistence of this misnomer that the model and terminology survive in a number of scholarly works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gustav E. Mueller|editor=Jon Stewart|title=The Hegel Myths and Legends|url=|accessdate=|year=1996|publisher=Northwestern University Press|isbn=0-8101-1301-5|page=301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Renaissance ===
In the last half of the 20th century, Hegel's philosophy underwent a major renaissance. This was due to (a) the rediscovery and re-evaluation of Hegel as a possible philosophical progenitor of Marxism by philosophically oriented Marxists; (b) a resurgence of the historical perspective that Hegel brought to everything; and (c) an increasing recognition of the importance of his [[dialectical method]]. [[György Lukács]]' ''[[History and Class Consciousness]]'' (1923) helped to reintroduce Hegel into the Marxist canon. This sparked a renewed interest in Hegel reflected in the work of [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Theodor W. Adorno]], [[Ernst Bloch]], [[Raya Dunayevskaya]], [[Alexandre Kojève]] and [[Gotthard Günther]] among others. In ''[[Reason and Revolution]]'' (1941), [[Herbert Marcuse]] made the case for Hegel as a revolutionary and criticized [[Leonard Trelawny Hobhouse]]'s thesis that Hegel was a totalitarian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Paul | last=Robinson | title=The Freudian Left: Wilhelm Reich, Geza Roheim, Herbert Marcuse | year=1990 | publisher=Cornell University Press | isbn=0-87220-424-3| page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hegel renaissance also highlighted the significance of Hegel's early works, i.e. those written before ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]''. The direct and indirect influence of Kojève's lectures and writings (on ''The Phenomenology of Spirit'' in particular) mean that it is not possible to understand most French philosophers from [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] to [[Jacques Derrida]] without understanding Hegel.&lt;ref&gt;French philosopher [[Vincent Descombes]] introduced the term "post-Kojèvian discourse" to designate the period of French philosophy after the 1930s (Vincent Descombes, ''Modern French Philosophy'', Cambridge University Press, 1980, pp. 158–9).&lt;/ref&gt; American [[neoconservative]] [[political science|political theorist]] [[Francis Fukuyama]]'s controversial book ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]'' (1992) was heavily influenced by Kojève.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Howard | last=Williams |author2=David Sullivan |author3=Gwynn Matthews  | title=Francis Fukuyama and the End of History | year=1997 | publisher=University of Wales Press | isbn=0-7083-1428-7 | pages=70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Swiss theologian [[Hans Küng]] has also advanced contemporary scholarship in Hegel studies.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Beginning in the 1960s, Anglo-American Hegel scholarship has attempted to challenge the traditional interpretation of Hegel as offering a metaphysical system: this has also been the approach of [[Z. A. Pelczynski]] and [[Shlomo Avineri]]. This view, sometimes referred to as the "non-metaphysical option", has had a decided influence on many major English language studies of Hegel in the past forty years.

Late 20th-century literature in Western [[Theology]] that is friendly to Hegel includes works by such writers as [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] (1966), [[Dale M. Schlitt]] (1984), [[Theodore Geraets]] (1985), [[Philip M. Merklinger]] (1991), [[Stephen Rocker]] (1995) and [[Cyril O'Regan]] (1995).

Two prominent American philosophers, [[John McDowell]] and [[Robert Brandom]] (sometimes referred to as the "[[University of Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh]] Hegelians"), have produced philosophical works exhibiting a marked Hegelian influence. Each is avowedly influenced by the late [[Wilfred Sellars]], also of Pittsburgh, who referred to his seminal work ''Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind'' (1956) as a series of "incipient ''Méditations Hegeliennes''" (in homage to [[Edmund Husserl]]'s 1931 work, ''[[Cartesian Meditations|Méditations cartésiennes]]'').

Beginning in the 1990s after the fall of the Soviet Union, a fresh reading of Hegel took place in the West. For these scholars, fairly well represented by the Hegel Society of America and in cooperation with German scholars such as Otto Pöggeler and Walter Jaeschke, Hegel's works should be read without preconceptions. Marx plays little-to-no role in these new readings. Some American philosophers associated with this movement include [[Lawrence Stepelevich]], [[Rudolf Siebert]], Richard Dien Winfield and [[Theodore Geraets]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

=== Criticism ===
Criticism of Hegel has been widespread in the 19th and the 20th centuries. A diverse range of individuals including [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Bertrand Russell]], [[G. E. Moore]], [[Eric Voegelin]] and [[A. J. Ayer]] have challenged Hegelian philosophy from a variety of perspectives. Among the first to take a critical view of Hegel's system was the 19th-century German group known as the [[Young Hegelians]], which included Feuerbach, Marx, Engels and their followers. In Britain, the Hegelian [[British idealism]] school (members of which included [[Francis Herbert Bradley]], [[Bernard Bosanquet (philosopher)|Bernard Bosanquet]] and in the United States [[Josiah Royce]]) was challenged and rejected by [[analytic philosophy|analytic]] philosophers Moore and Russell. In particular, Russell considered "almost all" of Hegel's doctrines to be false.&lt;ref&gt;B. Russell, ''History of Western Philosophy'', chapter 22, paragraph 1, p. 701.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding Hegel's interpretation of history, Russell commented: "Like other historical theories, it required, if it was to be made plausible, some distortion of facts and considerable ignorance".&lt;ref&gt;Russell, 735.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Logical positivism|Logical positivists]] such as Ayer and the [[Vienna Circle]] criticized both Hegelian philosophy and its supporters, such as Bradley.

Hegel's contemporary Schopenhauer was particularly critical and wrote of Hegel's philosophy as "a pseudo-philosophy paralyzing all mental powers, stifling all real thinking".&lt;ref&gt;On the Basis of Morality.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1820, Schopenhauer became a lecturer at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] and he scheduled his lectures to coincide with those of Hegel, whom Schopenhauer had also described as a "clumsy charlatan".&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, Arthur. Author's preface to "On The Fourfold Root of the Principle of sufficient reason. Page 1. [[:s:On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason|On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, only five students ended up attending Schopenhauer's lectures so he dropped out of [[academia]]. Kierkegaard criticized Hegel's "absolute knowledge" unity.&lt;ref&gt;Søren Kierkegaard Concluding Unscientific Postscriptt&lt;/ref&gt; The physicist and philosopher [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] also criticized the obscure complexity of Hegel's works, referring to Hegel's writing as an "unclear thoughtless flow of words".&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Boltzmann, ''Theoretical physics and philosophical problems: Selected writings'', p. 155, [[D. Reidel]], 1974, {{ISBN|90-277-0250-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar vein, Robert Pippin notes that some view Hegel as having "the ugliest prose style in the history of the German language".&lt;ref&gt;Robert B. Pippin, ''Hegel's Idealism: The Satisfaction of Self-Consciousness (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989), 5&lt;/ref&gt; Russell wrote in ''[[A History of Western Philosophy]]'' (1945) that Hegel was "the hardest to understand of all the great philosophers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|title=A History of Western Philosophy|date=1972|page=730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Popper]] wrote that "there is so much philosophical writing (especially in the Hegelian school) which may justly be criticized as meaningless verbiage".&lt;ref&gt;Karl Popper, ''Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge'' (New York: Routledge, 1963), 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Popper also makes the claim in the second volume of ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'' (1945) that Hegel's system formed a thinly veiled justification for the [[Absolute monarchy|absolute rule]] of [[Frederick William III of Prussia|Frederick William III]] and that Hegel's idea of the ultimate goal of history was to reach a [[sovereign state|state]] approximating that of 1830s [[Prussia]]. Popper further proposed that Hegel's philosophy served not only as an inspiration for [[communism|communist]] and [[fascism|fascist]] totalitarian governments of the 20th century, whose dialectics allow for any belief to be construed as rational simply if it could be said to exist. Kaufmann and [[Shlomo Avineri]] have criticized Popper's theories about Hegel.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance Walter Kaufmann (1959), [http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/us/kaufmann.htm ''The Hegel Myth and Its Method'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Isaiah Berlin]] listed Hegel as one of the six architects of modern [[authoritarianism]] who undermined [[liberal democracy]], along with Rousseau, [[Claude Adrien Helvétius]], Fichte, [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]] and [[Joseph de Maistre]].&lt;ref&gt;Berlin, Isaiah, ''Freedom and Betrayal: Six Enemies of Human Liberty'' (Princeton University Press, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

Voegelin argued that Hegel should be understood not as a philosopher, but as a "sorcerer", i.e. as a [[mysticism|mystic]] and [[Hermeticism|hermetic]] thinker.&lt;ref&gt;Voegelin, Eric (1972). "On Hegel—A Study in Sorcery", in  J. T. Fraser, F. Haber &amp; G. Muller (eds.), ''The Study of Time''. Springer-Verlag. 418--451 (1972)&lt;/ref&gt; This concept of Hegel as a hermetic thinker was elaborated by Glenn Alexander Magee,&lt;ref&gt;Magee, Glenn Alexander (2001), ''Hegel and the Hermetic Tradition'', Ithaca: Cornell University Press&lt;/ref&gt; who argued that interpreting Hegel's body of work as an expression of mysticism and hermetic ideas leads to a more accurate understanding of Hegel.&lt;ref&gt;"I do not argue that merely that we ''can'' understand Hegel as a Hermetic thinker, just as we can understand him as a German or a Swabian or an idealist thinker. Instead, I argue that we ''must'' understand Hegel as a Hermetic thinker, if we are to truly understand him at all." Magee 2001, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16610">'''Gerhard Emmanuel''' "'''Gerry'''" '''Lenski, Jr.''' (August 13, 1924 – December 7, 2015) was an American [[sociologist]] known for contributions to the sociology of religion, [[social inequality]], and introducing the [[ecological-evolutionary theory]].  He spent much of his career as a professor at the [[University of North Carolina]] at [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]], where he served as chair of the Department of Sociology, 1969–72, and as chair of the Division of Social Sciences, 1976-78.

== Life and career ==

Lenski was born and raised in [[Washington, DC]], the son of a [[Lutheran]] pastor,&lt;ref name="father_obit"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1978/11/11/gerhard-e-lenski-88-ex-pastor-of-grace-lutheran-church-here/283a70a9-fd54-4aaf-8e1a-7116b5f36153/|title=Gerhard E. Lenski, 88, Ex-Pastor Of Grace Lutheran Church Here|date=11 November 1978|newspaper=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; the grandson of [[German American|German-born]] [[theologian]] [[Richard C. H. Lenski|Richard Charles Henry Lenski]],{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} and the nephew of children's author [[Lois Lenski]]. He attended [[Yale University]] where he received a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA degree]] in 1947, after serving as a [[cryptographer]] with the [[8th Air Force]] in England in World War II, and then earned his PhD from Yale in 1950.

Lenski was awarded a Pre-doctoral Fellowship by the [[Social Science Research Council]], 1949–50, and later a Senior Faculty Fellowship, 1961–62; a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]], 1972–73; and IREX Senior Faculty Exchange Fellowships, for Poland, 1978, and Hungary, 1988.  He served as Vice President of the [[American Sociological Association]], 1969–70, and was nominee for President in 1972.  He was also President of the [[Southern Sociological Society]], 1977–78 and elected Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], 1976.  In 2002, he was awarded  the Career of Distinguished Scholarship Award by the American Sociological Association.&lt;ref name="asa_awards_2002"&gt;{{cite pr|url=http://www.asanet.org/footnotes/septoct02/fn6.html|title=Major Award Recipients Honored in Chicago|publisher=[[American Sociological Association]]|date=Fall 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="unc_soc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sociology.unc.edu/gerhard-lenski-1924-2015|title=Gerhard Lenski, 1924-2015|author=Karen Judge|publisher=[[University of North Carolina]], Department of Sociology|date=December 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His writings have been translated into German, Swedish, Spanish, Polish, and Chinese (both [[Mandarin Chinese|mainland]] and [[Taiwanese Mandarin|Taiwanese]] translations).

Lenski married poet Jean Cappelmann  in 1948. He and Jean Lenski were active in the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and opponents of the [[Vietnam War]]. They had four children, including [[evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologist]] [[Richard Lenski]].  Following Jean's death in 1994, he married Ann Bonar, widow of sociologist [[Hubert M. Blalock, Jr.|Hubert "Tad" Blalock]].  Lenski died in Edmonds, Washington at the age of 91.&lt;ref name="obit_rel"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://telliamedrevisited.wordpress.com/2015/12/07/a-life-well-lived/|title=A Life Well Lived|work=Telliamed Revisited|author=[[Richard Lenski]]|date=December 7, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222064537/https://telliamedrevisited.wordpress.com/2015/12/07/a-life-well-lived/|archivedate=December 22, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="unc_soc"/&gt;

== Scholarly work==

===Sociology of religion===

Much of Lenski's earliest work dealt with the [[sociology of religion]] and culminated in the publication of ''The Religious Factor''.&lt;ref name="rf"&gt;{{Cite book  | publisher = Doubleday U.S.  | last = Lenski  | first = Gerhard  | title = The Religious Factor : A Sociological Study of Religion's Impact on Politics, Economics, and Family Life   | year = 1961  | oclc=656217|lccn=61009197   }}&lt;/ref&gt; He defines religion as "a system of beliefs about the nature of force(s) ultimately shaping man's destiny and the practices associated therewith, shared by the members of a group.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Lenski, ''The Religious Factor'', p. 331&lt;/ref&gt; A reviewer in ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'' described the book as a "major achievement" in an often-neglected subfield,&lt;ref name="commentary_rf"&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/the-religious-factor-by-gerhard-lenski/|author=Marshall Sklare|title=The Religious Factor, by Gerhard Lenski|date=November 1, 1961|magazine=[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Robert Wuthnow]] has referred to this volume as "arguably one of a handful of 'classics' among contributions by American sociologists to the social scientific study of religion." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Robert Wuthnow|title=The Religious Factor Revisited|journal=Sociological Theory|volume=22|pages=205|doi=10.1111/j.0735-2751.2004.00212|doi-broken-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, Lenski's empirical inquiry into "religion's impact on politics, economics, and family life" in the [[Detroit]] area revealed, among other insights, that there were significant differences between [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] on the one hand and (white) [[Protestantism|Protestants]] and [[Jews]] on the other hand with regard to economics and the sciences. Lenski's findings supported basic hypotheses of [[Max Weber|Max Weber's]] work ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]''. According to Lenski, "the contributions of Protestantism to material progress have been largely unintended by-products of certain distinctive Protestant traits. This was a central point in Weber's theory." Lenski noted that more than a hundred years prior to Weber, [[John Wesley]], one of the founders of the [[Methodism|Methodist Church]], had observed that "diligence and frugality" made Methodists wealthy. "In an early era, Protestant [[asceticism]] and [[Protestant work ethic|dedication to work]], as noted by both Wesley and Weber, seem to have been important patterns of action contributing to economic progress. Both facilitated the accumulation of capital, so critically important to the economic growth and development of nations." However, Lenski said, asceticism was rare among modern Protestants, and the distinctive Protestant doctrine of "the calling" was largely forgotten. Instead, modern (white) Protestants and Jews had a high degree of "intellectual autonomy" that facilitated scientific and technical advance.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Lenski, ''The Religious Factor'', pp. 350-352&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, Lenski pointed out, Catholics developed an intellectual orientation which valued "obedience" to the teachings of their church above intellectual autonomy, which made them less inclined to enter scientific careers. Catholic sociologists&lt;ref&gt;Thomas F. O'Dea, ''The American Catholic Dilemma: An Inquiry into the Intellectual Life'', New York, N.Y., 1958&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frank L. Christ and Gerard Sherry (Editors), ''American Catholicism and the Intellectual Ideal'', New York, N.Y., 1961&lt;/ref&gt; had come to the same conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Lenski, ''The Religious Factor'', pp. 283-284&lt;/ref&gt;

Lenski traced these differences back to the [[Reformation]] and the Catholic church's reaction to it. In Lenski's view, the Reformation encouraged intellectual autonomy among Protestants, in particular [[Anabaptists]], [[Puritanism|Puritans]], [[Pietism|Pietists]], Methodists, and [[Presbyterian church|Presbyterians]]. In the [[Middle Ages]], there had been tendencies toward intellectual autonomy, as exemplified in men like [[Erasmus]]. But after the Reformation, the Catholic church leaders increasingly identified these tendencies with Protestantism and [[heresy]] and demanded that Catholics be obedient and faithful to ecclesiastical discipline. In Lenski's opinion, his study showed that these differences between Protestants and Catholics survived to the present day. As a consequence, "none of the predominantly and devoutly Catholic nations in the modern world can be classified as a ''leading'' industrial nation. Some Catholic nations - such as [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], and [[Chile]] - are quite highly industrialized, but none of them are leaders in the technological and scientific fields, nor do they seem likely to become so. Recently [1963] some Brazilian Catholic social scientists compared their country's progress with that of the [[United States of America|United States]] and concluded that the chief factor responsible for the differential rates of development is the religious heritage of the two nations."&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Lenski, ''The Religious Factor'', pp. 347-349&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecological-evolutionary theory===

In subsequent publications (''Power and Privilege'', 1966;&lt;ref name="pandp"&gt;{{cite book|title=Power and Privilege: A Theory of Social Stratification|publisher=McGraw-Hill|author=Gerhard Lenski|isbn=978-0807841198|year=1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Human Societies'', 1970;&lt;ref name="humsoc"&gt;{{cite book|title=Human Societies: An Introduction to Macrosociology|publisher=McGraw-Hill, Paradigm Press, Oxford University Press|year=1970|author1=Gerhard Lenski|author2=Patrick Nolan|author3=Jean Lenski|isbn=978-0199382453}} (in its 12th edition {{as of|2014}})&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Ecological-Evolutionary Theory'', 2006&lt;ref name="ecoevo"&gt;*  {{Cite book  | publisher = Paradigm Publishers  | isbn = 978-1-59451-101-1  | last = Lenski  | first = Gerhard  | title = Ecological-Evolutionary Theory: Principles and Applications  | date = May 2005  }}&lt;/ref&gt;), Lenski built on the foundations of [[evolutionary theory]] laid in the 18th century by [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|A.R.J. Turgot]], [[Adam Ferguson]], John Millar, and [[Thomas Malthus]], and in the 19th and 20th centuries by [[Lewis Henry Morgan]], [[Leslie White]], and [[Charles Darwin]] and the many biological evolutionists following him, to propose a more contemporary ecological and evolutionary theory  of societal development from the [[Stone Age]] to the present.  He has viewed the cumulation of information, especially technological information, as the most basic and most powerful factor in the evolution of human societies (though not the only one, as some of his critics have claimed).  Lenski has argued that the evolution of cultural information is an extension of the evolution of genetic information with the characteristics of human societies being the product of the interaction of both genetic and cultural influences.

Members of any given society are united by a shared and partially distinctive culture and networks of social relationships with one another.  These ties vary in intensity and distinctiveness depending on the magnitude of the society's store of information and the extent of contacts with other societies.  With the acquisition of signals, and later, symbols, the ancestors of modern humans gained the critically important ability to share information acquired through individual experience.  These and other later advances in the technologies of communication and transportation laid the foundations for major developments in political and economic systems, social inequality, science, ideology, and other spheres of life.&lt;ref&gt;''Ecological-Evolutionary Theory'', Part I; ''Human Societies'', 12th ed., ch. 1-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Lenski's theory has been well received. A former president of the [[American Political Science Association]], [[Heinz Eulau]], described ''Power and Privilege'' as a "masterpiece of comparative social analysis" and [[Ralf Dahrendorf]] referred to it as "an imaginative and substantial work [and] an indispensable guide."&lt;ref&gt;Reviews of ''Power and Privilege'', ''American Sociological Review'', vol. 61, pp. 482–5&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sociological Theory'' devoted an issue of the journal to commentaries on, and appreciations of, his work (vol. 22, no. 2, June, 2004).

One feature of Lenski's work that has won fairly wide acceptance among sociologists, as reflected in its incorporation into leading introductory textbooks in the discipline, is his ecological and evolutionary typology of human societies first proposed in ''Power and Privilege'' and enhanced later in ''Human Societies'' and other publications&lt;ref name="pandp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="humsoc"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sociology 14th Edition |last=Macionis |first=John J. |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This typology is based on a combination of two elements: (1) the kind of environment to which the society must adapt, and (2) its level of technological development.  In its most basic form, Lenski identifies seven types of societies:
* Societies of [[hunters and gatherers]]
* [[Horticulture|Horticultural]] societies
* Agricultural or [[agrarian society|agrarian societies]]
* [[Industrial society|Industrial societies]]
* Fishing societies
* Herding societies
* Maritime societies.
These types are often combined in various ways (for example, industrializing horticultural and agrarian societies, such as [[Ghana]] and [[Brazil]] in the late 20th century) and can be usefully subdivided into more or less advanced (e.g., simple and advanced horticultural societies).

An important feature of Lenski's theory has been his emphasis on the need for a broadly inclusive approach in theory building.  In a 1988 article, he argued that macrosociological theory should be based on our knowledge of the entire universe of human societies, past as well as present, and should seek to explain the major features of that universe, both its uniformities and its variations.&lt;ref name="rethinking"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2095685|year=1988|journal=American Sociological Review|author=Gerhard Lenski|title=Rethinking Macrosociological Theory|volume=53|issue=2|pp=163–171|doi=10.2307/2095685}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is undoubtedly a feature of the theory that many sociologists find troubling and unattractive because of the tradition developed in American sociology in the twentieth century of focusing theory and research on one's own society during a limited time period (i.e., American society in the 20th century) or a handful of societies (e.g., modern industrial societies) during an equally limited span of time.

===Critique of Marxism===

Another notable feature of Lenski's work has been his interest in [[Marxism|Marxist societies]].  This grew out of his concern for the forces shaping societal development.  [[Karl Marx]], who had a major influence on sociological thought in the mid-twentieth century, had a very optimistic view of human nature that is reflected in his belief in the inevitability of communism in the future when the governing principle in human societies would be "from each according to his ability, to each according to his need."  Lenski viewed the Marxist societies of the 20th century as important, but too often neglected, social experiments that put Marx's view of human nature to the test and found it wanting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gerhard Lenski|title=Marxist Experiments in Destratification: An Appraisal|journal=Social Forces|year=1978|jstor=2577674|volume=57|issue=2|pages=364|doi=10.2307/2577674}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Lenski, Patrick Nolan, Jean Lenski, ''Human Societies'', 7th ed., 1995, chapter 15&lt;/ref&gt; His earlier work in the 1950s on [[status inconsistency]] (i.e. [[social class]] divisions and ethnic tension and discrimination) had received a positive reception among a number of influential Eastern European sociologists who found it a much more effective tool than the [[Communist Party]]'s official model for analyzing and understanding the realities of social inequality in their societies, while at the same time providing a useful tool for challenging an increasingly unacceptable Communist social order.&lt;ref&gt;Birgitta Nedelmann and Piotr Sztomka (eds.), ''Sociology in Europe: In Search of Identity'' (Berlin: de Gruyter, 1993), p.&amp;nbsp;155&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kazimierz Slomczynski, ''Zmniejszanie Nierownosci Spolecznych a Rozbieznosc Czynnikow Statusu'' (Status Inconsistency and the Reduction of Social Inequalities) Studia Socjologiczne, 56 (1), pp.&amp;nbsp;35–46&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Golden Age (fresco by Pietro da Cortona).jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|''The Golden Age'' by [[Pietro da Cortona]] ([[Palazzo Pitti]], [[Florence]], [[Italy]]).]]

The term '''Golden Age'''  comes from [[Greek mythology]], particularly the ''[[Works and Days]]'' of [[Hesiod]], and is part of the description of temporal decline of the state of peoples through five [[Ages of Man|Ages]], [[Gold]] being the first and the one during which the Golden Race of humanity ({{Lang-el|χρύσεον γένος}} ''chrýseon génos'')&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=[[Hesiod]]|title=[[Works and Days]]|chapter=109}}.&lt;/ref&gt; lived. Those living in the  first Age were ruled by [[Cronus|Kronos]], after the finish of the first age was the [[Silver age|Silver]], then the [[Bronze Age (mythology)|Bronze]], after this the [[Greek Heroic Age|Heroic]] age, with the fifth and current age being [[Iron Age (mythology)|Iron]].&lt;ref&gt; Robin Hard - [https://books.google.com/books?id=r1Y3xZWVlnIC&amp;pg The Routledge Handbook of Greek Mythology: Based on H.J. Rose's "Handbook of Greek Mythology"], [https://books.google.com/books?id=r1Y3xZWVlnIC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=The+Golden+age+in+Greek+mythology&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj3gP-h9tvTAhVLbBoKHWhQDkwQ6AEIJTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Golden%20age%20in%20Greek%20mythology&amp;f=false p.69-70], [[Psychology Press]], 2004 {{ISBN|0415186366}}, Accessed 2017-06-May&lt;/ref&gt;

By extension "Golden Age" denotes a period of primordial [[peace]], [[harmony]], [[ecological stability|stability]], and [[prosperity]]. During this age peace and harmony prevailed, people did not have to work to feed themselves, for the earth provided food in abundance. They lived to a very old age with a youthful appearance, eventually dying peacefully, with spirits living on as "guardians". [[Plato]] in ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' (397 e) recounts the golden race of humans who came first. He clarifies that Hesiod did not mean literally made of gold, but good and noble.

In classical Greek mythology the Golden Age was presided over by the leading [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Cronus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Greek Myths|publisher=Penguin Books | author=Gravity, Grass|year=1960|location=London|pages=35–37|isbn=9780140171990}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some version of the myth [[Astraea (mythology)|Astraea]] also ruled. She lived with men until the end of the Silver Age, but in the Bronze Age, when men became violent and greedy, fled to the stars, where she appears as the constellation [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]], holding the scales of Justice, or [[Libra (constellation)|Libra]].&lt;ref&gt;"Hesiod calls [Astraea] the daughter of Jove and Themis. Aratus says that she is thought to be the daughter of Astraeus and Aurora, who lived at the time of the Golden Age of men and was their leader. On account of her carefulness and fairness she was called Justice, and at that time no foreign nations were attacked in war, nor did anyone sail over the seas, but they were wont to live their lives caring for their fields. But those born after their death began to be less observant of duty and more greedy, so that Justice associated more rarely with men. Finally the disease became so extreme that it was said the Brazen Race was born; then she could not endure more, and flew away to the stars." ([[Gaius Julius Hyginus]], [http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusAstronomica2.html#25 Astronomica 2]).&lt;/ref&gt;

European [[pastoral]] literary tradition often depicted nymphs and shepherds as living a life of rustic innocence and peace, set in [[Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadia]], a region of Greece that was the abode and center of worship of their tutelary deity, goat-footed [[Pan (god)|Pan]], who dwelt among them.&lt;ref&gt;Bridget Ann Henish, ''The Medieval Calendar Year'' ({{ISBN|0-271-01904-2}}), p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Golden Age in Europe: Greece==
The earliest attested reference to the European myth of the [[Ages of Man]] 500 BCE–350 BCE appears in the late 6th century BCE works of the [[Greek language|Greek]] poet [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Works and Days]]'' (109–126). Hesiod, a deteriorationist, identifies the Golden Age, the [[Silver age|Silver Age]], the Bronze Age, the [[Greek Heroic Age|Heroic Age]], and the [[Iron Age (mythology)|Iron Age]]. With the exception of the Heroic Age, each succeeding age was worse than the one that went before. Hesiod maintains that during the Golden Age, before the invention of the arts, the earth produced food in such abundance that there was no need for agriculture:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Men] lived like gods without sorrow of heart, remote and free from toil and grief: miserable age rested not on them; but with legs and arms never failing they made merry with feasting beyond the reach of all devils. When they died, it was as though they were overcome with sleep, and they had all good things; for the fruitful earth unforced bare them fruit abundantly and without stint. They dwelt in ease and peace.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Plato]] in his ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' referred to an age of golden men and also at some length on Ages of Man from Hesiod's ''Works and Days''. The Roman poet [[Ovid]] simplified the concept by reducing the number of Ages to four: Gold, Bronze, Silver, and Iron. Ovid's poetry, known to schoolboys from Antiquity through the Middle Ages and beyond,{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} was likely a prime source for the transmission of the myth of the Golden Age during the period when Western Europe had lost direct contact with Greek literature.

[[File:Goldenes-Zeitalter-1530-2.jpg|thumb|right|''The Golden Age'' by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]].]]

In Hesiod's version, the Golden Age ended when the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Prometheus]] conferred on mankind the gift of fire and all the other arts. For this, [[Zeus]] punished Prometheus by chaining him to a rock in the [[Caucasus]], where an eagle eternally ate at his liver. The gods sent the beautiful maiden [[Pandora]] to Prometheus's brother [[Epimetheus (mythology)|Epimetheus]]. The gods had entrusted Pandora with [[Pandora's box|a box]] that she was forbidden to open; however, her uncontrollable curiosity got the better of her and she opened the box, thereby unleashing all manner of evil into the world.

The [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic school]], a [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery cult]] that originated in [[Thrace]] and spread to Greece in the 5th century BCE, held similar beliefs about the early days of man, likewise denominating the ages with metals. In common with the many other mystery cults prevalent in the Graeco-Roman world (and their Indo-European religious antecedents), the [[world view]] of Orphism was cyclical. Initiation into its secret rites, together with ascetic practices, was supposed to guarantee the individual's soul eventual release from the grievous circle of mortality and also communion with god(s). Orphics sometimes identified the Golden Age with the era of the god [[Phanes (mythology)|Phanes]], who was regent over the [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]] before Cronus. In [[classical mythology]] however, the Golden Age was associated with the reign of [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]]. In the 5th century BCE, the philosopher [[Empedocles]], like Hesiod before him, emphasized the idea of primordial innocence and harmony in all of nature, including human society, from which he maintained there had been a steady deterioration until the present.

===Arcadia===
A tradition arose in Greece that the site of the original Golden Age had been [[Arcadia]], an impoverished rural area of Greece where the herdsmen still lived on acorns and where the goat-footed god Pan had his home among the poplars on Mount [[Maenalus]]. However, in the 3rd century BCE, the Greek poet, [[Theocritus]], writing in [[Alexandria]], set his pastoral poetry in on the lushly fertile island of Sicily, where he had been born. The protagonist of Theocritus's first [[Idyll]], the goat herder, [[Daphnis]], is taught to play the [[Syrinx]] (panpipes) by Pan himself. [[File:PanandDaphnis.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.15|Sculpture of [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] teaching [[Daphnis]] to play the pipes; c. 100 BCE Found in [[Pompeii]].]]

==The Golden Age in Rome: Virgil and Ovid==
Writing in Latin during the turbulent period of revolutionary change at the end of the [[Roman Republic]] (roughly between 44 and 38 BCE), the poet [[Virgil]] moved the setting for his pastoral imitations of Theocritus back to an idealized Arcadia in Greece, thus initiating a rich and resonant tradition in subsequent European literature.

Virgil, moreover, introduced into his poetry the element of political allegory, which had been largely absent in Theocritus, even intimating in his fourth [[Eclogue]] that a new Golden Age of peace and justice was about to return:
&lt;poem&gt;''Ultima Cumaei venit iam carminis aetas;
''magnus ab integro saeclorum nascitur ordo:
''iam redit et Virgo, redeunt Saturnia regna;
''iam nova progenies caelo demittitur alto.''&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;'''Translation:'''
''Now the last age by Cumae's Sibyl sung
''Has come and gone, and the majestic roll
''Of circling centuries begins anew:
''Astraea returns,
''Returns old Saturn's reign,
''With a new breed of men sent down from heaven.''&lt;ref&gt;[[Eclogues|Eclogue]] (lines [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0056&amp;layout=&amp;loc=4.1 5-8)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

Somewhat later, shortly before he wrote his epic poem the ''[[Aeneid]]'', which dealt with the establishment of Roman Imperial rule, Virgil composed his ''[[Georgics]]'' (29 BCE), modeled directly on Hesiod's ''Works and Days'' and similar Greek works. Ostensibly about agriculture, the ''Georgics'' are in fact a complex allegory about how man's alterations of nature (through works) are related to good and bad government. Although Virgil does not mention the Golden Age by name in the ''Georgics'', he does refer in them to a time of primitive communism before the reign of [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]], when:
&lt;poem&gt;
''Fields knew no taming hand of husbandmen
''To mark the plain or mete with boundary-line.
''Even this was impious; for the common stock
''They gathered, and the earth of her own will
''All things more freely, no man bidding, bore.''&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
''ante Iouem nulli subigebant arua coloni
''ne signare quidem aut partiri limite campum
''fas erat; in medium quaerebant, ipsaque tellus
''omnia liberius nullo poscente ferebat.'' ([http://www.theoi.com/Text/VirgilGeorgics1.html#1 ''Georgics'', Book 1: 125–28])&lt;/poem&gt;

This view, which identifies a [[State of Nature]] with the celestial harmony of which man's nature is (or should be, if properly regulated) a [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]], reflects the [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic cosmology]] that prevailed among literate classes of Virgil's era. It is seen again in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'' (7 CE), in which the lost Golden Age is depicted as a place and time when, because nature and reason were harmoniously aligned, men were naturally good:
&lt;poem&gt;
''The Golden Age was first; when Man, yet new,
''No rule but uncorrupted Reason knew:
''And, with a native bent, did good pursue.
''Unforc'd by punishment, un-aw'd by fear.''
''His words were simple, and his soul sincere;
''Needless was written law, where none opprest:
''The law of Man was written in his breast.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/metamorphoses-book-the-first/ Ovid's ''Metamorphoses'', Book the First, eighteenth century version, "Translated into English verse under the direction of Sir Samuel Garth by [[John Dryden]], [[Alexander Pope]], [[Joseph Addison]], [[William Congreve]], and other eminent hands.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

The Graeco-Roman concept of the "natural man" delineated by Ovid and many other classical writers, was especially popular during the [[Deism|Deistically]] inclined 18th century. It is often erroneously attributed to [[Rousseau]], who did not share it.&lt;ref&gt;See A. O. Lovejoy's essay on "The Supposed Primitivism of Rousseau's Discourse on Inequality" in ''Essays in the History of Ideas'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press, 1948, 1960)&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Soft" and "hard" primitivism in Arcadia==
In his famous essay, "[[Et in Arcadia ego]]: Poussin and the Elegiac Tradition",&lt;ref&gt;"Et in Arcadia ego: Poussin and the Elegiac Tradition," in ''Meaning in the Visual Arts'' (New York: Doubleday, 1955) pp. 297–98.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erwin Panofsky]] remarks how in ancient times, "that particular not overly opulent, region of central Greece, Arcady, came to be universally accepted as an ideal realm of perfect bliss and beauty, a dream incarnate of ineffable happiness, surrounded nevertheless with a halo of 'sweetly sad' melancholy":

&lt;blockquote&gt;
There had been, from the beginning of classical speculation, two contrasting opinions about the natural state of man, each of them, of course, a "Gegen-Konstruktion" to the conditions under which it was formed. One view, termed "soft" primitivism in an illuminating book by Lovejoy and Boas&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Oncken Lovejoy|A. O, Lovejoy]] and G. Boas, ''Primitivism and Related Ideas in Antiquity'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press, 1935).&lt;/ref&gt; conceives of primitive life as a golden age of plenty, innocence, and happiness—in other words, as civilized life purged of its vices. The other, "hard" form of primitivism conceives of primitive life as an almost subhuman existence full of terrible hardships and devoid of all comforts—in other words, as civilized life stripped of its virtues.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Arcady, as we encounter it in all modern literature, and as we refer to it in our daily speech, falls under the heading of “soft" or golden-age primitivism. To be sure, this real Arcady was the domain of Pan, who could be heard playing the [[Syrinx (instrument)|syrinx]] on Mount [[Maenalus]]; and its inhabitants were famous for their musical accomplishments as well as for their ancient lineage, rugged virtue, and rustic hospitality.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Other Golden Ages==
There are analogous concepts in the religious and philosophical traditions of the South Asian subcontinent. For example, the [[Vedas|Vedic]] or ancient [[Hindu]] culture saw history as cyclical, composed of [[yuga]]s with alternating Dark and Golden Ages. The Kali yuga (Iron Age), Dwapara yuga (Bronze Age), Treta yuga (Silver Age) and Satya yuga (Golden Age) correspond to the four Greek ages. Similar beliefs occur in the ancient [[Middle East]] and throughout the ancient world, as well.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Heinberg (1989). ''Memories and Visions of Paradise: Exploring the Universal Myth of a Lost Golden Age'' Los Angeles, Calif.: Tarcher. 282 pp. MISBN 0-87477-515-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hindu===
The Indian teachings differentiate the four world ages ([[Yugas]]) not according to metals, but according to quality with Truth being the defining feature of the Golden Age. After the world fall at the end of the fourth, worst age (the Kali yuga) named after the Messianic figure Kali, the cycle should be continued, eventually culminating in a new golden age.

The [[Krita Yuga]] also known as the Satya yuga, the First and Perfect Age, as described in the [[Mahabharata]], a [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[Epic poetry|epic]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;Men neither bought nor sold; there were no poor and no rich; there was no need to labour, because all that men required was obtained by the power of will; the chief virtue was the abandonment of all worldly desires. The ''Krita Yuga'' was without disease; there was no lessening with the years; there was no hatred or vanity, or evil thought whatsoever; no sorrow, no fear. All mankind could attain to supreme blessedness.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Satya Yuga lasts for 1,728,000 years, Treta Yuga 1,296,000 years, Dvapara Yuga 864,000 years and Kali Yuga 432,000 years. According to the Puranas there are 71 such cycles in a life of Manu whose life duration is 306.72 million years. The reign of fourteen Manus (4.32 billion years) comprises one day (Kalpa) of Brahma.&lt;ref&gt;Matsya Purana&lt;/ref&gt;
Knowledge, meditation, and communion with Spirit hold special importance in this era. The average life expectancy of a human being in Satya Yuga is believed to be about 100,000 years. That duration of life declines in next age, Treta Yuga to 10,000 years, followed by Dvapara Yuga 1 000 years and Kali Yuga up to 100 years. During Satya Yuga, most people engage only in good, sublime deeds and mankind lives in harmony with the earth. [[Ashrams]] become devoid of wickedness and deceit. [[Natya]]m (such as [[Bharatanatyam]]), according to [[Natya Shastra]], did not exist in the Satya Yuga "because it was the time when all people were happy".

===Brahma Kumaris===
The [[Brahma Kumaris]] and [[AIVV|Prajapita Brahma Kumaris]] make reference to five yuga in a single cycle of 5,000 years in which the Golden Age, or Satya yuga, is the first and lasts for 1,250 years. Three of the remaining four; Thretha Yuga (Silver Age), Dwarpar Yuga (Copper Age) and Kali Yuga (Iron Age), also last for 1,250 years each. The fifth age, Sangum Yuga (Confluence Age), is given to the last 100 years of the fourth age and represents the period when the Iron Age is destroyed and the next Golden Age is created.&lt;ref name="4ages"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brahmakumaris.com/rajayoga-meditation/cycle-of-time.html |title=The ages of the time cycle according to the Brahma Kumaris |archivedate=15 December 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091215144916/http://www.brahmakumaris.com/rajayoga-meditation/cycle-of-time.html |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;The World Drama is the story of the rise and fall of human souls during their sojourn in this world. It is about the interplay of souls, matter and God, and of the different stages through which human souls pass in five different epochs or acts of this drama.The drama begins with the Golden Age, when every soul expresses its original qualities of purity, peace, love and truth, and human relationships are marked by complete harmony. The virtuous nature of these divine beings is mirrored by nature, which is in its pristine state and serves humans with abundance. This is the time remembered as heaven or paradise by humanity.

Golden age is the time when the human beings are full of all the divine virtues and have all the seven qualities peace, purity, love, wisdom, happiness, power and bliss to the fullest. And henceforth they are called deities, that we remember them as were our ancestors and whose divinity is worshiped in Hindu temples. The silver age comes after golden age where as time goes by, the souls, who are the actors in this drama, undergo a gradual decline. By Act Two, the number of souls has increased significantly, and though all are still happy and prosperous, the radiance and fullness that characterized their lives is no more.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.brahmakumaris.com/rajyoga-meditation/the-world-drama/|title=The World Drama - Brahma Kumaris® Int'l HQ {{!}} Godly University For Free RajYoga Meditation|work=Brahma Kumaris® Int'l HQ {{!}} Godly University For Free RajYoga Meditation|access-date=2018-05-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rajayoga Mediation taught at the Brahma Kumaris are the way to revive the seven qualities within and awaken self true divinity, the souls of Satyuga AKA Golden Age has.

Meditation energizes your awareness, bringing both peace and wisdom to a busy mind. It expands one’s capacity to love, and heals broken hearts. It also dissolves many fears, replacing them with lightness and freedom from anxiety.

But perhaps the greatest gift that meditation brings is the glow of inner peace that is both gentle and strong.

Practice of Rajyoga meditation or intellectual communion with God brings into the soul many powers. Of these, eight are important.[http://www.brahmakumaris.com/rajyoga-meditation/benefits-of-meditation/ The Eight Powers.]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Norse===
The [[Old Norse]] word ''gullaldr'' (literally "Golden Age") was used in [[Völuspá]] to describe the period after [[Ragnarök]], where the surviving gods and their progeny build the city [[Gimlé]] on the ruins of [[Asgard]]. In this period, [[Baldr]] reigns.

===Bible===
There is a reference to a succession of kingdoms in [[Nebuchadnezzar II|Nebuchadnezzar]]'s dream in [[Daniel 2]], in decreasing order identified as gold, silver, bronze, iron and finally mixed iron and clay.

{{quote|31 "Your Majesty looked, and there before you stood a large statue – an enormous, dazzling statue, awesome in appearance. 32 The head of the statue was made of pure gold, its chest and arms of silver, its belly and thighs of bronze, 33 its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of baked clay. 34 While you were watching, a rock was cut out, but not by human hands. It struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay and smashed them. 35 Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver and the gold were all broken to pieces and became like chaff on a threshing floor in the summer. The wind swept them away without leaving a trace. But the rock that struck the statue became a huge mountain and filled the whole earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=daniel+2%3A+31-35&amp;version=NIV|title=Daniel 2: 31-35|publisher=Zondervon|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Daniel 2: 31-35}}

The interpretation of the dream follows in verses 36–45.

===Fantasy===
In modern [[fantasy world]]s, whose background and setting sometimes draw heavily on real-world myths, similar or compatible concepts of a Golden Age exist in the said world's prehistory; when deities or [[Elves in fantasy fiction and games|elf]]-like creatures existed, before the coming of [[human]]s.

For example, in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], a Golden Age exists in [[Middle-earth]] legendarium. [[Arda (Middle-earth)|Arda]] (the part of the world where ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' is set), was designed to be symmetrical and perfect. After the wars of the Gods, Arda lost its perfect shape (known as [[Arda Unmarred]]) and was called [[Arda Marred]]. Another kind of 'Golden Age' follows later, after the Elves awoke; the [[Eldar (Middle-earth)|Eldar]] stay on [[Valinor]], live with the [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Valar]] and advance in arts and knowledge, until the rebellion and the fall of the [[Noldor]], reminiscent of the Fall of Man. Eventually, after the [[Dagor Dagorath|end of the world]], the [[Silmaril]]li will be recovered and the light of the [[Two Trees of Valinor]] rekindled. Arda will be remade again as [[Arda Healed]].

In ''[[The Wheel of Time]]'' universe, the "Age of Legends" is the name given to the previous Age: In this society, channelers were common and [[Aes Sedai]] – trained channelers – were extremely powerful, able to make [[Concepts in the Wheel of Time series#Items of Power|''angreal'', ''sa'angreal'', and ''ter'angreal'']], and holding important civic positions. The Age of Legends is seen as a utopian society without war or crime, and devoted to culture and learning. Aes Sedai were frequently devoted to academic endeavours, one of which inadvertently resulted in a hole – The Bore – being drilled in the Dark One's prison. The immediate effects were not realised, but the Dark One gradually asserted power over humanity, swaying many to become his followers. This resulted in the War of Power and eventually the Breaking of the World.

Another example is in the background of the ''[[Lands of Lore]]'' classic computer game, where the history of the Lands is divided in Ages. One of them is also called the Golden Age, a time when the Lands were ruled by the 'Ancients', and there were no wars. This age ended with the 'War of the Heretics'.

The Golden Age may also refer to a state of early childhood. Herbert Spencer argued that young children progress through the cognitive stages of evolution of the human species and of human civilization, thereby linking pre-civilization and infancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Education|last=Spencer|first=Herbert|publisher=|year=1861|isbn=|location=|pages=5.|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth Grahame]] called his evocation of early childhood {{'}}''The Golden Age''{{'}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Golden Age|last=Grahame|first=Kenneth|publisher=The Bodley Head|year=1985|isbn=|location=UK|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[J.

'''''Historiae Ecclesiasticae Tripartitae Epitome''''', the abridged history (in twelve books) of the early [[Christian Church]] known as the '''''Tripartite History,'''''  was the standard manual of Church history in [[Medieval Europe]]. 

The work was compiled, under the direction of [[Cassiodorus]], in about 510 CE, by his assistant [[Epiphanius Scholasticus]]. Epiphanius was assigned the translation into Latin of the Greek church histories of [[Socrates Scholasticus]], [[Sozomen]] and [[Theodoret]], written in the previous century. He would probably have used the library assembled by Cassiodorus at Monasterium Vivariense, the monastery of Vivarium on his family estates at the foot of Mount Moscius on the shores of the Ionian Sea. Cassiodorus revised and corrected the work and arranged it into one continuous history of the church. His [[scriptorium]] then published it for the use of the clergy. 

The book attained a high reputation. Only [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]]' ''History'', in a Latin translation by [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]] competed with it as the official version of church history in the West, until original sources began to be rediscovered, edited and printed by [[Humanism|humanist]] scholars in the 15th century.

The causes and mechanisms of the '''Fall of the Western Roman Empire''' are a historical theme that was introduced by historian [[Edward Gibbon]] in his 1776 book ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]''. He started an ongoing [[historiography|historiographical]] discussion about what caused the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire]], and the reduced power of the remaining Eastern Empire, in the 4th–5th centuries. Gibbon was not the first to speculate on why the Empire collapsed, but he was the first to give a well-researched and well-referenced account.  Many theories of causality have been explored. In 1984, [[Alexander Demandt]] enumerated 210 different theories on why Rome fell, and new theories emerged thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://crookedtimber.org/2003/08/25/decline-and-fall | first=Alexander | last=Demandt | title= 210 Theories | work=[[Crooked Timber]] weblog entry | date=August 25, 2003 | accessdate=June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utexas.edu/courses/rome/210reasons.html Alexander Demandt: 210 Theories] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316232650/http://www.utexas.edu/courses/rome/210reasons.html |date=2015-03-16 }}, Source: A. Demandt, ''Der Fall Roms'' (1984) 695. See also: Karl Galinsky in ''Classical and Modern Interactions'' (1992) 53-73.&lt;/ref&gt; Gibbon himself explored ideas of internal decline (the disintegration of political, economic, military, and other social institutions, civil wars) and of [[Migration Period|attacks from outside the Empire]]. "From the eighteenth century onward," historian [[Glen Bowersock]] wrote, "we have been obsessed with the fall: it has been valued as an archetype for every perceived decline, and, hence, as a symbol for our own fears."&lt;ref&gt;Bowersock, "The Vanishing Paradigm of the Fall of Rome" ''Bulletin of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]'' (1996) 49#8 pp 29-43 at p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview of historiography==
[[Historiography|Historiographically]], the primary issue historians have looked at when analyzing any theory is the continued existence of the Eastern Empire or Byzantine Empire, which lasted almost a thousand years after the fall of the West. For example, Gibbon implicates Christianity in the fall of the Western Empire, yet the eastern half of the Empire, which was even more Christian than the west in geographic extent, fervor, penetration and vast numbers continued on for a thousand years afterwards (although Gibbon did not consider the Eastern Empire to be much of a success). As another example, environmental or weather changes affected the east as much as the west, yet the east did not "fall."

Theories will sometimes reflect the particular concerns that historians might have on cultural, political, or economic trends in their own times. Gibbon's criticism of Christianity reflects the values of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]; his ideas on the decline in martial vigor could have been interpreted by some as a warning to the growing [[British Empire]]. In the 19th century [[socialism|socialist]] and anti-socialist theorists tended to blame [[decadence]] and other political problems. More recently, [[natural environment|environment]]al concerns have become popular, with [[deforestation]] and [[soil erosion]] proposed as major factors, and destabilizing population decreases due to [[epidemic]]s such as early cases of bubonic plague and [[malaria]] also cited. Global [[climate changes of 535–536]], perhaps caused by the possible eruption of [[Krakatoa]] in 535, as mentioned by [[David Keys (author)|David Keys]] and others,&lt;ref name="Krakatoa"&gt;{{cite book |last=Winchester |first=Simon |authorlink=Simon Winchester |title=[[Krakatoa: The Day the World Exploded, August 27, 1883]] |publisher=HarperCollins |year=2003 |isbn=0-06-621285-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; is another example. Ideas about transformation with no distinct fall mirror the rise of the [[postmodern]] tradition, which rejects [[periodization]] concepts (see [[metanarrative]]). What is not new are attempts to diagnose Rome's particular problems, with [[Satire X]], written by Juvenal in the early 2nd century at the height of Roman power, criticizing the peoples' obsession with "[[bread and circuses]]" and rulers seeking only to gratify these obsessions.

One of the primary reasons for the vast number of theories is the notable lack of surviving evidence from the 4th and 5th centuries. For example, there are so few records of an economic nature it is difficult to arrive at even a generalization of the economic conditions. Thus, historians must quickly depart from available evidence and comment based on how things ought to have worked, or based on evidence from previous and later periods, on [[inductive reasoning]]. As in any field where available evidence is sparse, the historian's ability to imagine the 4th and 5th centuries will play as important a part in shaping our understanding as the available evidence, and thus be open for endless interpretation.

The end of the Western Roman Empire traditionally has been seen by historians to mark the end of the [[Ancient Era]] and beginning of the Middle Ages. More recent schools of history, such as [[Late Antiquity]], offer a more nuanced view from the traditional historical narrative.

There is no consensus on a date for the start of the Decline. Gibbon started his account in 98.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} The year 376 is taken as pivotal by many modern historians.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} In that year there was an unmanageable influx of [[Goths]] and other [[Barbarians]] into the Balkan provinces, and the situation of the Western Empire generally worsened thereafter, with recoveries being incomplete and temporary. Significant events include the [[Battle of Adrianople]] in 378, the death of [[Theodosius I]] in 395 (the last time the Roman Empire was politically unified), the [[crossing of the Rhine]] in 406 by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]], the execution of [[Stilicho]] in 408, the [[Sack of Rome (410)|sack of Rome]] in 410, the death of [[Constantius III]] in 421, the death of [[Flavius Aetius|Aetius]] in 454, and the [[Sack of Rome (455)|second sack of Rome]] in 455, with the death of [[Majorian]] in 461 marking the end of the last opportunity for recovery.

Gibbon took September 4, 476 as a convenient marker for the [[final dissolution of the Western Roman Empire]], when [[Romulus Augustus]], the last [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] of the [[Western Roman Empire]], was deposed by [[Odoacer]], a Germanic chieftain. Some modern historians question the significance of the year 476 for its end.&lt;ref&gt;Arnaldo Momigliano, echoing the trope of the sound a tree falling in the forest, titled an article in 1973, "La caduta senza rumore di un impero nel 476 d.C." ("The noiseless fall of an empire in 476 AD").&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julius Nepos]], the Western emperor recognized by the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]], continued to rule in [[Dalmatia]], until he was assassinated in 480. The [[Ostrogoth]]ic rulers of [[Italia]] considered themselves upholders of the direct line of Roman tradition, and the Eastern emperors considered themselves the sole rightful Roman rulers of a united empire.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} Roman cultural traditions continued throughout the territory of the Western Empire, and a recent school of interpretation argues that the great political changes can more accurately be described as a complex cultural transformation, rather than a fall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Making of the West, Peoples and Cultures, Volume A: To 1500|author=Hunt, Lynn |author2=Thomas R. Martin |author3=Barbara H. Rosenwein |author4=R. Po-chia Hsia |author5=Bonnie G. Smith |publisher=Bedford / St. Martins|year=2001|isbn= 0-312-18365-8|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview of events==
{{See also|Late Antiquity|Migration Period|Fall of the Western Roman Empire}}
[[File:RomulusAugustus.jpg|thumb|right|206px|[[Romulus Augustus]] was deposed as [[Western Roman Empire|Western Roman Emperor]] in 476 while still young. However, [[Julius Nepos]] continued to claim the title of Western Emperor after his deposition.]]

The decline of the [[Roman Empire]] is one of the traditional markers of the end of [[Classical Antiquity]] and the beginning of the European [[Middle Ages]]. Throughout the 5th century, the Empire's territories in western Europe and northwestern Africa, including Italy, fell to various invading or indigenous peoples in what is sometimes called the [[Migration period]]. Although the eastern half still survived with borders essentially intact for several centuries (until the [[Muslim conquests]]), the Empire as a whole had initiated major cultural and political transformations since the [[Crisis of the Third Century]], with the shift towards a more openly [[Autocracy|autocratic]] and ritualized form of government, the adoption of [[Christianity]] as the [[state religion]], and a general rejection of the traditions and values of Classical Antiquity. While traditional historiography emphasized this break with Antiquity by using the term "[[Byzantine Empire]]" instead of Roman Empire, recent schools of history offer a more nuanced view, seeing mostly continuity rather than a sharp break. The Empire of [[Late Antiquity]] already looked very different from [[Ancient Rome|classical Rome]].

The Roman Empire emerged from the [[Roman Republic]] when [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Augustus Caesar]] transformed it from a republic into a monarchy. Rome reached its zenith in the 2nd century, then fortunes slowly declined (with many revivals and restorations along the way). The reasons for the decline of the Empire are still debated today, and are likely multiple. Historians infer that the population appears to have diminished in many provinces—especially western Europe—from the diminishing size of fortifications built to protect the cities from [[barbarian]] incursions from the 3rd century on. Some historians even have suggested that parts of the periphery were no longer inhabited because these fortifications were restricted to the center of the city only. Tree rings suggest "distinct drying" beginning in 250.&lt;ref name=treerings&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12186245 | title = Roman rise and fall 'recorded in trees' | last = Kinver | first = Mark |date = 14 January 2011 | work =[[BBC]] | accessdate = 24 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 3rd century, the city of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] no longer served as an effective capital for the [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] and various cities were used as new administrative capitals. Successive emperors, starting with [[Constantine I|Constantine]], privileged the eastern city of [[Byzantium]], which he had entirely rebuilt after a siege. Later renamed [[Constantinople]], and protected by formidable walls in the late 4th and early 5th centuries, it was to become the largest and most powerful city of Christian [[Europe]] in the [[Early Middle Ages]]. Since the Crisis of the Third Century, the Empire was intermittently ruled by more than one emperor at once (usually two), presiding over different regions. At first a haphazard form of power sharing, this eventually settled on an East-West administrative division between the [[Western Roman Empire]] (centered on Rome, but now usually presided from other seats of power such as [[Trier]], [[Mediolanum|Milan]], and especially [[Ravenna]]), and the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] (with its capital initially in [[Nicomedia]], and later Constantinople). The [[Latin]]-speaking west, under dreadful demographic crisis, and the wealthier{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} [[Greek language|Greek]]-speaking east, also began to diverge politically and culturally. Although this was a gradual process, still incomplete when Italy came under the rule of barbarian chieftains in the last quarter of the 5th century, it deepened further afterward, and had lasting consequences for the medieval history of Europe.

Throughout the 5th century, Western emperors were usually figureheads, while the Eastern emperors maintained more independence. For most of the time, the actual rulers in the West were military strongmen who took the titles of ''[[magister militum]]'', [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]], or both, such as [[Stilicho]], [[Flavius Aetius|Aetius]], and [[Ricimer]]. Although Rome was no longer the capital in the West, it remained the West's largest city and its economic center. But the city was [[Sack of Rome (410)|sacked by rebellious Visigoths in 410]] and [[Sack of Rome (455)|by the Vandals in 455]], events that shocked contemporaries and signaled the disintegration of Roman authority. [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] wrote ''[[City of God (book)|The City of God]]'' partly as an answer to critics who blamed the sack of Rome by the Visigoths on the abandonment of the traditional [[paganism|pagan]] religions.

In June 474, [[Julius Nepos]] became Western Emperor but in the next year the ''magister militum'' [[Orestes (Roman soldier)|Orestes]] revolted and made his son [[Romulus Augustus]] emperor. Romulus, however, was not recognized by the Eastern Emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] and so was technically an usurper, Nepos still being the legal Western Emperor. Nevertheless, Romulus Augustus is often known as the last Western Roman Emperor. In 476, after being refused lands in Italy, Orestes' Germanic mercenaries under the leadership of the chieftain [[Odoacer]] captured and executed Orestes and took [[Ravenna]], the Western Roman capital at the time, deposing Romulus Augustus. The whole of Italy was quickly conquered, and Odoacer was granted the title of patrician by Zeno, effectively recognizing his rule in the name of the Eastern Empire. Odoacer returned the Imperial insignia to Constantinople and ruled as King in Italy. Following Nepos' death [[Theodoric the Great]], King of the [[Ostrogoths]], conquered Italy with Zeno's approval.

Meanwhile, much of the rest of the Western provinces were conquered by [[Migration Period|waves of Germanic invasions]], most of them being disconnected politically from the East altogether and continuing a slow decline. Although Roman political authority in the West was lost, Roman culture would last in most parts of the former Western provinces into the 6th century and beyond.

The first invasions disrupted the West to some degree, but it was the [[Gothic War (535–552)|Gothic War]] launched by the Eastern Emperor [[Justinian I|Justinian]] in the 6th century, and meant to reunite the Empire, that eventually caused the most damage to Italy, as well as straining the Eastern Empire militarily. Following these wars, Rome and other Italian cities would fall into severe decline (Rome itself was almost completely abandoned). Another blow came with the [[Roman-Persian Wars#Climax|Persian invasion of the East]] in the 7th century, immediately followed by the [[Muslim conquests]], especially of [[History of Roman Egypt|Egypt]], which curtailed much of the key trade in the Mediterranean on which Europe depended.

The Empire was to live on in the East for many centuries, and enjoy periods of recovery and cultural brilliance, but its size would remain a fraction of what it had been in classical times. It became an essentially regional power, centered on [[Greece]] and [[Anatolia]]. Modern historians tend to prefer the term ''Byzantine Empire'' for the eastern, medieval stage of the Roman Empire.

===Highlights===
{{See also|Fall of the Western Roman Empire}}
The decline of the Western Roman Empire was a process spanning many centuries; there is no consensus when it might have begun but many dates and time lines have been proposed by historians.
;3rd century:
* The [[Crisis of the Third Century]] (234–284), a period of political instability.
* The reign of Emperor [[Diocletian]] (284–305), who attempted substantial political and economic reforms, many of which would remain in force in the following centuries.

;4th century:
* The reign of [[Constantine I]] (306–337), who built the new eastern capital of [[Constantinople]] and converted to [[Christianity]], legalizing and even favoring to some extent this religion. All Roman emperors after Constantine, except for [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]], would be Christians.
* The [[Gothic War (376-382)|first war]] with the [[Visigoths]] (376–382), culminating in the [[Battle of Adrianople]] (August 9, 378), in which a large Roman army was defeated by the Visigoths, and Emperor [[Valens]] was killed. The Visigoths, fleeing a migration of the [[Huns]], had been allowed to settle within the borders of the Empire by Valens, but were mistreated by the local Roman administrators, and rebelled.
* The reign of [[Theodosius I]] (379–395), last emperor to reunite under his authority the western and eastern halves of the Empire. Theodosius continued and intensified the policies against [[paganism]] of his predecessors, eventually outlawing it, and making [[First Council of Nicaea|Nicaean]] Christianity the [[state religion]].

;5th century:
* The [[Crossing of the Rhine]]: on December 31, 406 (or 405, according to some historians), a mixed band of [[Vandals]], [[Suebi]] and [[Alans]] crossed the frozen river [[Rhine]] at Moguntiacum (modern [[Mainz]]), and began to ravage [[Gaul]]. Some moved on to the regions of [[Hispania]] and [[Africa Province|Africa]]. The Empire would never regain control over most of these lands.
* The second war with the Visigoths, led by king [[Alaric I|Alaric]], in which they raided Greece, and then invaded Italy, culminating in the [[Sack of Rome (410)|sack of Rome]] (410). The Visigoths eventually left Italy and founded the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] in southern Gaul and Hispania.
* The rise of the [[Hunnic Empire]] under [[Attila the Hun|Attila]] and [[Bleda]] (434–453), who raided the [[Balkans]], Gaul, and Italy, threatening both Constantinople and Rome.
* The [[Sack of Rome (455)|second sack of Rome]], this time by the Vandals (455).
* Failed counterstrikes against the Vandals (461–468). The Western Emperor [[Majorian]] planned a naval campaign against the Vandals to reconquer northern Africa in 461, but word of the preparations got out to the Vandals, who took the Roman fleet by surprise and destroyed it. A [[Basiliscus#Disastrous expedition against the Vandals|second naval expedition against the Vandals]], sent by Emperors [[Leo I (emperor)|Leo I]] and [[Anthemius]], was defeated at [[Battle of Cape Bon (468)|Cape Bon]] in 468.
[[File:476eur.jpg|thumb|center|500px|{{center|Europe in 476, from ''Muir's Historical Atlas'' (1911)}}]]
* Deposition of the last Western Emperors, [[Julius Nepos]] and [[Romulus Augustus]] (475–480). Julius Nepos, who had been nominated by the Eastern Emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]], was deposed by the rebelled ''magister militum'' [[Flavius Orestes|Orestes]], who installed his own son Romulus in the imperial throne. Both Zeno and his rival [[Basiliscus]], in the East, continued to regard Julius Nepos, who fled to [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]], as the legitimate Western Emperor, and Romulus as an usurper. Shortly after, [[Odoacer]], ''magister militum'' appointed by Julius, invaded Italy, defeated Orestes, and deposed Romulus Augustus on September 4, 476. Odoacer then proclaimed himself ruler of Italy and asked the Eastern Emperor Zeno to become formal Emperor of both empires, and in so doing legalize Odoacer's own position as Imperial viceroy of Italy. Zeno did so, setting aside the claims of Nepos, who was murdered by his own soldiers in 480.
* Foundation of the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] in Italy (493). Concerned with the success and popularity of Odoacer, Zeno started a campaign against him, at first with words, then by inciting the [[Ostrogoths]] to take back Italy from him. They did as much, but then founded an independent kingdom of their own, under the rule of king [[Theodoric the Great|Theodoric]]. Italy and the entire West were lost to the Empire.

==Theories and explanations of a fall==
The various theories and explanations for the fall of the Roman Empire in the West may be very broadly classified into four schools of thought, although the classification is not without overlap:

* [[#Decay owing to general malaise|Decay owing to general malaise]]
* [[#Monocausal decay|Monocausal decay]]
* [[#Catastrophic collapse|Catastrophic collapse]]
* [[#Transformation|Transformation]]

The tradition positing general malaise goes back to [[Edward Gibbon]] who argued that the edifice of the Roman Empire had been built on unsound foundations to begin with. According to Gibbon, the fall was - in the final analysis - inevitable. On the other hand, Gibbon had assigned a major portion of the responsibility for the decay to the influence of Christianity, and is often, though perhaps unjustly, seen as the founding father of the school of monocausal explanation.

On the other hand, the school of catastrophic collapse holds that the fall of the Empire had not been a pre-determined event and need not be taken for granted. Rather, it was due to the combined effect of a number of adverse processes, many of them set in motion by the [[Migration Period|Migration of the Peoples]], that together applied too much stress to the Empire's basically sound structure.

Finally, the transformation school challenges the whole notion of the 'fall' of the Empire, asking to distinguish between the fall into disuse of a particular political dispensation, anyway unworkable towards its end, and the fate of the Roman civilisation which under-girded the Empire. According to this school, drawing its basic premise from the [[#Henri Pirenne|Pirenne thesis]], the Roman world underwent a gradual (though often violent) series of transformations, morphing into the medieval world. The historians belonging to this school often prefer to speak of [[Late Antiquity]] instead of the Fall of the Roman Empire.

===Decay owing to general malaise===

====Edward Gibbon====
In ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' (1776–88), [[Edward Gibbon]] famously placed the blame on a loss of [[civic virtue]] among the Roman citizens. They gradually entrusted the role of defending the Empire to [[Barbarian#Modern academia|barbarian]] [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] who eventually turned on them. Gibbon held that [[Christianity]] contributed to this shift by making the populace less interested in the worldly ''here-and-now'' because it was willing to wait for the rewards of [[heaven]].

{{quote|The decline of Rome was the natural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatness. Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight.}}

{{quote|In discussing Barbarism and Christianity I have actually been discussing the Fall of Rome.}}

====Vegetius on military decline====
Writing in the 5th century, the Roman historian [[Vegetius]] pleaded for reform of what must have been a greatly weakened army. The historian [[Arther Ferrill]] has suggested that the Roman Empire – particularly the military – declined largely as a result of an influx of Germanic mercenaries into the ranks of the legions. This "Germanization" and the resultant cultural dilution or "barbarization" led not only to a decline in the standard of drill and overall military preparedness within the Empire, but also to a decline of loyalty to the Roman government in favor of loyalty to commanders. Ferrill agrees with other Roman historians such as A.H.M. Jones:
{{quote|...the decay of trade and industry was not a cause of Rome’s fall. There was a decline in agriculture and land was withdrawn from cultivation, in some cases on a very large scale, sometimes as a direct result of barbarian invasions. However, the chief cause of the agricultural decline was high taxation on the marginal land, driving it out of cultivation. Jones is surely right in saying that taxation was spurred by the huge military budget and was thus ‘indirectly’ the result of the barbarian invasion.&lt;ref&gt;Arther Ferrill, ''The Fall of the Roman Empire: The Military Explanation'' (New York: Thames and Hudson Ltd., 1986),&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Arnold J. Toynbee and James Burke====
In contrast with the declining empire theories, historians such as [[Arnold J. Toynbee]] and [[James Burke (science historian)|James Burke]] argue that the Roman Empire itself was a rotten system from its inception, and that the entire Imperial era was one of steady decay of institutions founded in [[Roman Republic|Republican]] times. In their view, the Empire could never have lasted longer than it did without radical reforms that no Emperor could implement. The Romans had no budgetary system and thus wasted whatever resources they had available. The economy of the Empire was a [[Raubwirtschaft]] or plunder economy based on [[looting]] existing resources rather than producing anything new. The Empire relied on riches from conquered territories (this source of revenue ending, of course, with the end of Roman territorial expansion) or on a pattern of tax collection that drove small-scale farmers into destitution (and onto a [[welfare (financial aid)|dole]] that required even more exactions upon those who could not escape taxation), or into dependency upon a landed élite exempt from taxation. With the cessation of tribute from conquered territories, the full cost of their military machine had to be borne by the citizenry.

An economy based upon slave labor precluded a middle class with buying power. The Roman Empire produced few exportable goods. Material innovation, whether through entrepreneurialism or technological advancement, all but ended long before the final dissolution of the Empire. Meanwhile, the costs of military defense and the pomp of Emperors continued. Financial needs continued to increase, but the means of meeting them steadily eroded. In the end, due to economic failure, even the armor and weaponry of soldiers became so obsolete that the enemies of the Empire had better armor and weapons as well as larger forces. The decrepit social order offered so little to its subjects that many saw the barbarian invasion as liberation from onerous obligations to the ruling class.

By the late 5th century the barbarian conqueror [[Odoacer]] had no use for the formality of an Empire upon deposing [[Romulus Augustus]] and chose neither to assume the title of Emperor himself nor to select a puppet, although legally he kept the lands as a commander of the Eastern Empire and maintained the Roman institutions such as the [[consulship]]. The formal end of the Roman Empire on the West in AD 476 thus corresponds with the time in which the Empire and the title Emperor no longer had value.

====Michael Rostovtzeff, Ludwig von Mises, and Bruce Bartlett====
Historian [[Michael Rostovtzeff]] and economist [[Ludwig von Mises]] both argued that unsound economic policies played a key role in the impoverishment and decay of the Roman Empire. According to them, by the 2nd century AD, the Roman Empire had developed a complex [[market economy]] in which trade was relatively free. [[Tariff]]s were low and laws controlling the prices of foodstuffs and other commodities had little impact because they did not fix the prices significantly below their market levels. After the 3rd century, however, [[debasement]] of the currency (i.e., the minting of coins with diminishing content of [[gold]], [[silver]], and [[bronze]]) led to [[inflation]]. The [[Incomes policy|price control]] laws then resulted in prices that were significantly below their free-market equilibrium levels. It should, however, be noted that [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] initiated a successful [[Constantine the Great#Monetary reforms|reform of the currency]] which was completed before the barbarian invasions of the 4th century, and that thereafter the currency remained sound everywhere that remained within the empire until at least the 11th century - at any rate for gold coins.

According to Rostovtzeff and Mises, artificially low prices led to the scarcity of foodstuffs, particularly in [[city|cities]], whose inhabitants depended on trade to obtain them. Despite laws passed to prevent migration from the cities to the countryside, urban areas gradually became depopulated and many Roman citizens abandoned their specialized trades to practice [[subsistence agriculture]]. This, coupled with increasingly oppressive and arbitrary [[tax]]ation, led to a severe net decrease in trade, [[technology|technical]] innovation, and the overall wealth of the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, [http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cjv14n2-7.html "How Excessive Government Killed Ancient Rome"], by [[Bruce Bartlett]], and [http://www.capitalismmagazine.com/economics/classics/3015-politics-ideas-the-rise-and-decline-of-civilization-lecture-6-part-3-of-4.html "The Rise and Decline of Civilization"], by [[Ludwig von Mises]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bruce Bartlett]] traces the beginning of debasement to the reign of [[Nero]]. He claims that the emperors increasingly relied on the army as the sole source of their power, and therefore their economic policy was driven more and more by a desire to increase military funding in order to buy the army's loyalty. By the 3rd century, according to Bartlett, the monetary economy had collapsed. But the imperial government was now in a position where it had to satisfy the demands of the army at all costs. Failure to do so would result in the army forcibly deposing the emperor and installing a new one. Therefore, being unable to increase monetary taxes, the Roman Empire had to resort to direct requisitioning of physical goods anywhere it could find them - for example taking food and cattle from farmers. The result, in Bartlett's view, was social chaos, and this led to different responses from the authorities and from the common people. The authorities tried to restore order by requiring free people (i.e. non-slaves) to remain in the same occupation or even at the same place of employment. Eventually, this practice was extended to force children to follow the same occupation as their parents. So, for instance, farmers were tied to the land, and the sons of soldiers had to become soldiers themselves. Many common people reacted by moving to the countryside, sometimes joining the estates of the wealthy, and in general trying to be self-sufficient and interact as little as possible with the imperial authorities. Thus, according to Bartlett, Roman society began to dissolve into a number of separate estates that operated as closed systems, provided for all their own needs and did not engage in trade at all. These were the beginnings of feudalism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cjv14n2-7.html "How Excessive Government Killed Ancient Rome"], by [[Bruce Bartlett]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Joseph Tainter====
In his 1988 book ''The Collapse of Complex Societies'', American anthropologist [[Joseph Tainter|Tainter]] presents the view that for given technological levels there are implicit declining returns to complexity, in which systems deplete their resource base beyond levels that are ultimately sustainable. Tainter argues that societies become more complex as they try to solve problems. Social complexity can include differentiated [[social]] and [[economic]] roles, reliance on [[symbol]]ic and [[abstraction|abstract]] [[communication]], and the existence of a class of information producers and analysts who are not involved in primary resource production. Such complexity requires a substantial "energy" subsidy (meaning [[Natural resource|resources]], or other forms of [[wealth]]). When a society confronts a "problem", such as a shortage of or difficulty in gaining access to [[energy]], it tends to create new layers of [[bureaucracy]], [[infrastructure]], or [[social class]] to address the challenge.

For example, as Roman [[agricultural productivity|agricultural output]] slowly declined and population increased, per-capita energy availability dropped. The Romans solved this problem in the short term by conquering their neighbours to appropriate their energy surpluses (metals, grain, slaves, etc.). However, this solution merely exacerbated the issue over the long term; as the Empire grew, the cost of maintaining communications, garrisons, civil government, etc., increased. Eventually, this cost grew so great that any new challenges such as invasions and crop failures could not be solved by the acquisition of more territory. At that point, the Empire fragmented into smaller units.

We often assume that the collapse of the Roman Empire was a catastrophe for everyone involved. Tainter points out that it can be seen as a very rational preference of individuals at the time, many of whom were better off (all but the elite, presumably.) Archeological evidence from human bones indicates that average nutrition improved after the collapse in many parts of the former Roman Empire. Average individuals may have benefited because they no longer had to invest in the burdensome complexity of empire.

In Tainter's view, while [[invasions]], [[famine|crop failures]], [[disease]] or [[environmental degradation]] may be the ''apparent'' causes of [[societal collapse]], the ultimate cause is ''diminishing returns on investments in social [[complexity]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Tainter, Joseph (1988) "The Collapse of Complex Societies" (Princeton Uni Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Adrian Goldsworthy====
In ''The Complete Roman Army'' (2003) [[Adrian Goldsworthy]], a British military historian, sees the causes of the collapse of the Roman Empire not in any 'decadence' in the make-up of the Roman legions, but in a combination of endless civil wars between factions of the Roman Army fighting for control of the Empire. This inevitably weakened the army and the society upon which it depended, making it less able to defend itself against the growing numbers of Rome's enemies. The army still remained a superior fighting instrument to its opponents, both civilized and barbarian; this is shown in the victories over Germanic tribes at the [[Battle of Strasbourg]] (357) and in its ability to hold the line against the Sassanid Persians throughout the 4th century. But, says Goldsworthy, "Weakening central authority, social and economic problems and, most of all, the continuing grind of civil wars eroded the political capacity to maintain the army at this level."&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Roman Army'' (2003) p. 214 [[Adrian Goldsworthy]]&lt;/ref&gt; Goldsworthy set out in greater detail his theory that recurring civil wars during the late fourth and early fifth centuries contributed to the fall of the West Roman Empire (395-476), in his book ''The Fall of the West: The Slow Death of the Roman Superpower'' (2009).

===Monocausal decay===

====Disease====
[[William Hardy McNeill|William H. McNeill]], a [[World History|world historian]], noted in chapter three of his book ''Plagues and Peoples'' (1976) that the Roman Empire suffered the severe and protracted [[Antonine Plague]] starting around 165 AD. For about twenty years, waves of one or more diseases, possibly the first epidemics of [[smallpox]] and [[measles]], swept through the Empire, ultimately killing about half the population. Similar [[Pandemic|epidemics]], such as the [[Plague of Cyprian]], also occurred in the 3rd century. McNeill argues that the severe fall in population left the state apparatus and army too large for the population to support, leading to further economic and social decline that eventually killed the [[Western Empire]]. The Eastern half survived due to its larger population, which even after the plagues was sufficient for an effective state apparatus.

Archaeology has revealed that from the 2nd century onward, the inhabited area in most Roman towns and cities grew smaller and smaller. Imperial laws concerning "agri deserti", or deserted lands, became increasingly common and desperate. The economic collapse of the 3rd century may also be evidence of a shrinking population as Rome’s tax base was also shrinking and could no longer support the Roman Army and other Roman institutions.

Rome's success had led to increased contact with Asia though trade, especially in a sea route through the Red Sea that Rome cleared of pirates shortly after conquering Egypt. Wars also increased contact with Asia, particularly wars with the Persian Empire. With increased contact with Asia came increased transmission of disease into the Mediterranean from Asia. Romans used public fountains, public latrines, public baths, and supported many brothels all of which were conducive to the spread of pathogens. Romans crowded into walled cities and the poor and the slaves lived in very close quarters with each other. Epidemics began sweeping though the Empire.

The culture of the German barbarians living just across the Rhine and Danube rivers was not so conducive to the spread of pathogens. Germans lived in small scattered villages that did not support the same level of trade as did Roman settlements. Germans lived in single-family detached houses. Germans did not have public baths nor as many brothels and drank ale made with boiled water. The barbarian population seemed to be on the rise. The demographics of Europe were changing.

Economically, depopulation led to the impoverishment of East and West as economic ties among different parts of the empire weakened. Increasing raids by barbarians further strained the economy and further reduced the population, mostly in the West. In areas near the Rhine and Danube frontiers, raids by barbarians killed Romans and disrupted commerce. Raids also forced Romans into walled towns and cities furthering the spread of pathogens and increasing the rate of depopulation in the West. A low population and weak economy forced Rome to use barbarians in the Roman Army to defend against other barbarians.

====Environmental degradation====
{{further|Deforestation during the Roman period}}

Another theory is that gradual environmental degradation caused population and economic decline. [[Deforestation]] and excessive grazing led to [[erosion]] of meadows and cropland. Increased irrigation without suitable drainage caused [[Soil salinity|salinization]], especially in North Africa. These human activities resulted in fertile land becoming nonproductive and eventually increased desertification in some regions. Many animal species become extinct.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humecol.lu.se/woshglec/papers/hughes.doc Lunds universitet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701014145/http://www.humecol.lu.se/woshglec/papers/hughes.doc |date=2007-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The recent research of Tainter stated that "deforestation did not cause the Roman collapse",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tainter |first=Joseph |doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.35.081705.123136 |title=Archeology of Overshoot and Collapse |journal=[[Annual Review of Anthropology]] |year=2006 |volume=35 |issue= |pages=59–74 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although it could be a minor contributing factor.

Also, high taxes and heavy slavery are another reason for decline as they forced small farmers out of business and into the cities, which became overpopulated. Roman cities were only designed to hold a certain number of people, and once they passed that, disease, water shortage and food shortage became common.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

====Lead poisoning====
{{See also|Lead poisoning}}

Publishing several articles in the 1960s, the sociologist [[S. Colum Gilfillan|Seabury Colum Gilfillan]] advanced the argument that lead poisoning was a significant factor in the decline of the Roman Empire.&lt;ref name="Gilfillan 1"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gilfillan |first=S. Colum |title=The Inventive Lag in Classical Mediterranean Society |journal=Technology and Culture |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=85–87 |date=Winter 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilfillan 2"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gilfillan |first=S.C. |url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/MankindQuarterly-1965jan-00131 |title=Roman Culture and Dysgenic Lead Poisoning |journal=The Mankind Quarterly |volume=5 |pages=131–148 |date=1965 |accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilfillan 3"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gilfillan |first=S.C. |title=Lead Poisoning and the Fall of Rome |journal=Journal of Occupational Medicine |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=53–60|date=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, a posthumously published book elaborated on Gilfillan's work on this topic.&lt;ref name="Gilfillan 4"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gilfillan |first=S.C. |title=Rome's Ruin by Lead Poison |publisher=Wenzel Press |year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jerome Nriagu, a geochemist, argued in a 1983 book that "lead poisoning contributed to the decline of the Roman empire." His work centred on the level to which the [[ancient Rome|ancient Romans]], who had few sweeteners besides [[honey]], would boil [[must]] in lead pots to produce a reduced sugar syrup called ''[[defrutum]]'', concentrated again into ''[[sapa (sweetener)|sapa]]''. This syrup was used to some degree to sweeten wine and food.&lt;ref name="Lessler"&gt;{{cite web |title=Lead and Lead Poisoning from Antiquity to Modern Times |url=https://kb.osu.edu/dspace/bitstream/1811/23252/1/V088N3_078.pdf |accessdate=11 Jan 2009 |author=Milton A. Lessler}}&lt;/ref&gt; If acidic must is boiled within lead vessels the sweet syrup it yields will contain a quantity of [[Lead(II) acetate|Pb(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or lead(II) acetate]].&lt;ref name="Lessler"/&gt; Lead was also leached from the glazes on [[amphora]]e and other pottery, from pewter drinking vessels and cookware, and from lead piping used for municipal water supplies and baths.&lt;ref name="pmid6338384"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nriagu JO |title=Saturnine gout among Roman aristocrats. Did lead poisoning contribute to the fall of the Empire? |journal=[[N. Engl. J. Med.]] |volume=308|issue=11|pages=660–3|date=March 1983|pmid=6338384 |doi=10.1056/NEJM198303173081123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main culinary use of ''defrutum'' was to sweeten wine, but it was also added to fruit and meat dishes as a sweetening and souring agent and even given to food animals such as suckling pig and duck to improve the taste of their flesh. ''Defrutum'' was mixed with ''[[garum]]'' to make the popular condiment ''[[oenogarum]]'' and as such was one of Rome's most popular condiments. Quince and melon were preserved in ''defrutum'' and honey through the winter, and some Roman women used ''defrutum'' or ''sapa'' as a cosmetic. ''Defrutum'' was often used as a food preservative in provisions for Roman troops.&lt;ref name="Brighton"&gt;{{cite video|title=Tales of the Living Dead: Poisoned Roman Babies|publisher=Brighton TV for National Geographic|people=Director: Chris Warren|medium=television|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nriagu produced a table showing his estimated consumption of lead by various classes within the Roman Empire. However, to produce the table Nriagu assumes all of the ''defrutum''/''sapa'' consumed to have been made in lead vessels:&lt;ref name="pmid6338384"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.epa.gov/r8/ceh/2007/Anderson.pdf|accessdate=11 Jan 2009|title=Children’s Environmental Health: Tribal Nations CEH Summit|author=Mark E.

Lead is not removed quickly from the body.

However, the lead content revealed in many other ancient Roman remains have been shown to have been less than half that of modern Europeans&lt;ref&gt;Drasch
1982:199–231&lt;/ref&gt; which have concentrations between 20-50ppm.&lt;ref name="CLUE"/&gt;

=====Criticism of lead poisoning theory=====
The role and importance of lead poisoning in contributing to the fall of the Roman Empire is the subject of controversy and its importance and validity is discounted by many historians.&lt;ref name="Lessler"/&gt; John Scarborough, a pharmacologist and classicist, criticized Nriagu's book as "so full of false evidence, miscitations, typographical errors, and a blatant flippancy regarding primary sources that the reader cannot trust the basic arguments."&lt;ref&gt;Scarborough, John (1984). ''The Myth of Lead Poisoning Among the Romans: An Essay Review''&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded that ancient authorities were well aware of lead poisoning and that it was not [[endemic (epedemiology)|endemic]] in the Roman empire nor did it cause its fall.

Although ''defrutum'' and ''sapa'' prepared in leaden containers would indubitably have contained toxic levels of lead, the use of leaden containers, though popular, was not the standard and copper was used far more generally. The exact amount of ''sapa'' added to wine was also not standardised and there is no indication how often ''sapa'' was added or in what quantity.

Additionally, Roman authors such as [[Pliny the Elder]]&lt;ref&gt;Historia Naturalis1 xxxiv.50.167&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vitruvius]] recognised the toxicity of lead. Vitruvius, who flourished during [[Augustus]]' time, writes that the Romans knew very well of the dangers.
{{quote|Water conducted through earthen pipes is more wholesome than that through lead; indeed that conveyed in lead must be injurious, because from it white lead [cerussa, lead carbonate, PbCO3] is obtained, and this is said to be injurious to the human system. This may be verified by observing the workers in lead, who are of a pallid colour; water should therefore on no account be conducted in leaden pipes if we are desirous that it should be wholesome.|VIII.6.10–11}}

Nevertheless, recent research supports the idea that the lead found in the water came from the supply pipes, rather than another source of contamination. It was not unknown for locals to punch holes in the pipes to draw water off, increasing the number of people exposed to the lead.
{{quote|Thirty years ago, Jerome Nriagu argued in a milestone paper that Roman civilization collapsed as a result of lead poisoning. [[Clair Patterson]], the scientist who convinced governments to ban lead from gasoline, enthusiastically endorsed this idea, which nevertheless triggered a volley of publications aimed at refuting it. Although today lead is no longer seen as the prime culprit of Rome's demise, its status in the system of water distribution by lead pipes (fistulæ) still stands as a major public health issue. By measuring Pb isotope compositions of sediments from the Tiber River and the Trajanic Harbor, the present work shows that "tap water" from ancient Rome had 100 times more lead than local spring waters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2014/04/16/1400097111 Hugo Delile – Lead in ancient Rome's city waters]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/apr/21/ancient-rome-tap-water-contaminated-lead-researchers Ancient Rome's tap water heavily contaminated with lead, researchers say] – ''The Guardian''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/d-brief/2014/04/21/ancient-romes-water-100-times-lead-local-spring-water/ Lead in Ancient Rome’s Water Was 100 Times Natural Levels] – Discover&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Catastrophic collapse===

====J. B. Bury====
[[J. B. Bury]]'s ''History of the Later Roman Empire'' (1889/1923) challenged the prevailing "theory of moral decay" established by Gibbon as well as the classic "clash of Christianity vs. paganism" theory, citing the relative success of the Eastern Empire, which was resolutely Christian. He held that Gibbon's grand history, though epoch-making in its research and detail, was too monocausal. His main difference from Gibbon lay in his interpretation of facts, rather than disputing any facts. He made it clear that he felt that Gibbon's thesis concerning "moral decay" was viable—but incomplete. Bury's judgment was that:&lt;ref name=bury&gt;Bury, J.B. [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/BURLAT/9*.html#7 History of the Later Roman Empire • Vol. I Chap. IX]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The gradual collapse of the Roman power ... was the consequence of a series of contingent events. No general causes can be assigned that made it inevitable.}}

Bury held that a number of crises arose simultaneously: economic decline, Germanic expansion, depopulation of Italy, dependency on Germanic ''foederati'' for the military, the disastrous (though Bury believed unknowing) treason of [[Stilicho]], loss of martial vigor, [[Flavius Aëtius|Aetius]]' murder, the lack of any leader to replace Aetius—a series of misfortunes which, in combination, proved catastrophic:
{{quote|The Empire had come to depend on the enrollment of barbarians, in large numbers, in the army, and ... it was necessary to render the service attractive to them by the prospect of power and wealth. This was, of course, a consequence of the decline in military spirit, and of depopulation, in the old civilised Mediterranean countries. The Germans in high command had been useful, but the dangers involved in the policy had been shown in the cases of [[Merobaudes (general)|Merobaudes]] and [[Arbogastes]]. Yet this policy need not have led to the dismemberment of the Empire, and but for that series of chances its western provinces would not have been converted, as and when they were, into German kingdoms. It may be said that a German penetration of western Europe must ultimately have come about. But even if that were certain, it might have happened in another way, at a later time, more gradually, and with less violence.

The point of the present contention is that Rome's loss of her provinces in the fifth century was not an "inevitable effect of any of those features which have been rightly or wrongly described as causes or consequences of her general 'decline'". The central fact that Rome could not dispense with the help of barbarians for her wars (''gentium barbararum auxilio indigemus'') may be held to be the cause of her calamities, but it was a weakness which might have continued to be far short of fatal but for the sequence of contingencies pointed out above.&lt;ref name=bury/&gt;}}

====Peter Heather====
[[Peter Heather]], in his ''The Fall of the Roman Empire'' (2005), maintains the Roman imperial system with its sometimes violent imperial transitions and problematic communications notwithstanding, was in fairly good shape during the first, second, and part of the 3rd centuries AD. According to Heather, the first real indication of trouble was the emergence in Iran of the [[Sassanid]] Persian empire (226–651). As reviewed by one writer on Heather's writing,
{{quote|The Sassanids were sufficiently powerful and internally cohesive to push back [[Roman legions]] from the Euphrates and from much of Armenia and southeast Turkey. Much as modern readers tend to think of the "Huns" as the nemesis of the Roman Empire, for the entire period under discussion it was the Persians who held the attention and concern of Rome and Constantinople. Indeed, 20–25% of the military might of the [[Roman Army]] was addressing the Persian threat from the late third century onward ... and upwards of 40% of the troops under the Eastern Emperors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://anglosphere.com/weblog/archives/000350.html Albion's Seedlings: Heather - The Fall of the Roman Empire]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Heather goes on to state—in the tradition of Gibbon and Bury—that it took the Roman Empire about half a century to cope with the Sassanid threat, which it did by stripping the western provincial towns and cities of their regional taxation income. The resulting expansion of military forces in the [[Middle East]] was finally successful in stabilizing the frontiers with the Sassanids, but the reduction of real income in the provinces of the Empire led to two trends which, Heather says, had a negative long-term impact. First, the incentive for local officials to spend their time and money in the development of local infrastructure disappeared. Public buildings from the 4th century onward tended to be much more modest and funded from central budgets, as the regional taxes had dried up. Second, Heather says "the landowning provincial literati now shifted their attention to where the money was ... away from provincial and local politics to the imperial bureaucracies." Having set the scene of an Empire stretched militarily by the Sassanid threat, Heather then suggests, using archaeological evidence, that the Germanic tribes on the Empire's northern border had altered in nature since the 1st century. Contact with the Empire had increased their material wealth, and that in turn had led to disparities of wealth sufficient to create a ruling class capable of maintaining control over far larger groupings than had previously been possible. Essentially they had become significantly more formidable foes.

Heather then posits what amounts to a domino theory—namely that pressure on peoples very far away from the Empire could result in sufficient pressure on peoples on the Empire's borders to make them contemplate the risk of full scale immigration to the empire. Thus he links the [[Goths|Gothic]] invasion of 376 directly to [[Huns|Hunnic]] movements around the Black Sea in the decade before. In the same way he sees the invasions across the Rhine in 406 as a direct consequence of further Hunnic incursions in [[Germania]]; as such he sees the Huns as deeply significant in the fall of the Western Empire long before they themselves became a military threat to the Empire. He postulates that the Hunnic expansion caused unprecedented immigration in 376 and 406 by barbarian groupings who had become significantly more politically and militarily capable than in previous eras. This impacted an empire already at maximum stretch due to the Sassanid pressure. Essentially he argues that the external pressures of 376–470 could have brought the Western Empire down at any point in its history.

He disputes Gibbon's contention that [[Christianity]] and moral decay led to the decline. He also rejects the political infighting of the Empire as a reason, considering it was a systemic recurring factor throughout the Empire's history which, while it might have contributed to an inability to respond to the circumstances of the 5th century, it consequently cannot be blamed for them. Instead he places its origin squarely on outside military factors, starting with the Sassanids. Like Bury, he does not believe the fall was inevitable, but rather a series of events which came together to shatter the Empire. He differs from Bury, however, in placing the onset of those events far earlier in the Empire's timeline, with the Sassanid rise.

====Bryan Ward-Perkins====
[[Bryan Ward-Perkins]]'s ''The Fall of Rome and the End of Civilization'' (2005) takes a traditional view tempered by modern discoveries, arguing that the empire's demise was caused by a vicious circle of political instability, foreign invasion, and reduced tax revenue. Essentially, invasions caused long-term damage to the provincial tax base, which lessened the Empire's medium- to long-term ability to pay and equip the legions, with predictable results. Likewise, constant invasions encouraged provincial rebellion as self-help, further depleting Imperial resources. Contrary to the trend among some historians of the "there was no fall" school, who view the fall of Rome as not necessarily a "bad thing" for the people involved, Ward-Perkins argues that in many parts of the former Empire the archaeological record indicates that the collapse was truly a disaster.

Ward-Perkins' theory, much like Bury's, and Heather's, identifies a series of cyclic events that came together to cause a definite decline and fall.

===Transformation===

==== Henri Pirenne ====
In the second half of the 19th century, some historians focused on the continuities between the Roman Empire and the post-Roman Germanic kingdoms rather than the rupture. In ''Histoire des institutions politiques de l'ancienne France'' (1875–89), [[Fustel de Coulanges]] argued that the barbarians simply contributed to an ongoing process of transforming Roman institutions.

[[Henri Pirenne]] continued this idea with the "Pirenne Thesis", published in the 1920s, which remains influential to this day. It holds that even after the barbarian invasions, the Roman way of doing things did not immediately change; barbarians came to Rome not to destroy it, but to take part in its benefits, and thus they tried to preserve the Roman way of life. The Pirenne Thesis regards the rise of the [[Frankish Empire|Frankish realm in Europe]] as a continuation of the Roman Empire, and thus validates the crowning of [[Charlemagne]] as the first [[Holy Roman Emperor]] as a successor of the Roman Emperors. According to Pirenne, the real break in Roman history occurred in the 7th and 8th centuries as a result of Arab expansion. Islamic conquest of the area of today's south-eastern Turkey, Syria, Palestine, North Africa, Spain and Portugal ruptured economic ties to western Europe, cutting the region off from trade and turning it into a stagnant backwater, with wealth flowing out in the form of raw resources and nothing coming back. This began a steady decline and impoverishment so that by the time of Charlemagne western Europe had become almost entirely agrarian at a subsistence level, with no long-distance trade. Pirenne's view on the continuity of the Roman Empire before and after the Germanic invasion has been supported by recent historians such as François Masai, [[Karl Ferdinand Werner]], and [[Peter Brown (historian)|Peter Brown]].

Some modern critics have argued that the "Pirenne Thesis" erred on two counts: by treating the [[Carolingian]] realm as a Roman state and by overemphasizing the effect of the Islamic conquests on the Byzantine or Eastern Roman Empire. Other critics have argued that while Pirenne was correct in arguing for the continuity of the Empire beyond the sack of Rome, the Arab conquests in the 7th century may not have disrupted [[Mediterranean]] trade routes to the degree that Pirenne argued. Michael McCormick in particular has argued that some recently unearthed sources, such as collective biographies, describe new trade routes. Moreover, other records and coins document the movement of Islamic currency into the Carolingian Empire. McCormick has concluded that if money was coming in, some type of goods must have been going out – including slaves, timber, weapons, honey, amber, and furs.

==== Lucien Musset and the clash of civilizations ====
In the spirit of "Pirenne thesis", a school of thought pictured a clash of civilizations between the Roman and the Germanic world, a process taking place roughly between 3rd and 8th century.

The French historian [[Lucien Musset]], studying the [[Barbarian invasions]], argues the civilization of [[Medieval]] [[Europe]] emerged from a synthesis between the [[Graeco-Roman]] world and the [[List of Germanic peoples|Germanic]] civilizations penetrating the Roman Empire. The Roman Empire did not fall, did not decline, it just transformed but so did the Germanic populations which invaded it. To support this conclusion, beside the narrative of the events, he offers [[linguistics|linguistic]] surveys of [[toponymy]] and [[anthroponymy]], analyzes archaeological records, studies the urban and rural society, the institutions, the religion, the art, the technology.

==== Late Antiquity ====
Historians of Late Antiquity, a field pioneered by Peter Brown, have turned away from the idea that the Roman Empire fell at all – refocusing instead on Pirenne's thesis. They see a transformation occurring over centuries, with the roots of Medieval culture contained in Roman culture and focus on the continuities between the classical and Medieval worlds. Thus, it was a gradual process with no clear break. Brown argues in his book that:

{{quote|Factors we would regard as natural in a 'crisis'—''malaise'' caused by urbanization, public disasters, the intrusion of alien religious ideas, and a consequent heightening of religious hopes and fears—may not have bulked as large in the minds of the men of the late second and third centuries as we suppose... The towns of the Mediterranean were small towns. For all their isolation from the way of life of the villagers, they were fragile excrescences in a spreading countryside."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Brown, ''The Making of Late Antiquity'' (Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1978), pp. 2–3&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{History of Australia}}
The '''history wars''' in Australia are an ongoing public debate over the interpretation of the history of the [[Australian history#British settlement and colonisation|British colonisation of Australia]] and development of contemporary Australian society (particularly with regard to the impact on [[Aboriginal Australians]] and [[Torres Strait Islanders]]).

The Australian debate often concerns the extent to which the history of European colonisation post-1788 and government administration since Federation in 1901 may be characterised as having been:

*a relatively minor conflict between European colonists and [[Indigenous Australians]], and generally lacking in events that might be termed 'invasion', 'warfare', '[[guerrilla warfare]]', 'conquest' or '[[genocide]]', and generally marked instead by humane intent by government authorities, with damage to indigenous people largely attributable to unintended factors (such as the spread of new diseases) rather than to malicious policies; or
*an invasion marked by violent conflict at the frontier, guerrilla warfare (or other forms of [[warfare]]) between Europeans and Aboriginal people, involving frequent or significant massacres of Aboriginal peoples engaged in defending their traditional tribal lands; a situation which can be said to have developed either nationally, or in certain areas, into something like a war of 'extermination' or something which accords with the term genocide as a consequence of British [[imperialism]] and [[colonialism]] involving continued dispossession, [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]], ill treatment and [[cultural genocide]].

The history wars also relates to broader themes concerning [[national identity]], as well as [[Historiography|methodological questions]] concerning the historian and the craft of researching and writing history, including issues such as the value and reliability of written records (of the authorities and settlers) and the [[oral tradition]] (of the Indigenous Australians), along with the political or similar [[ideological]] biases of those who interpret them.  One theme is how British or multicultural Australian identity has been in history and today.&lt;ref&gt;Neville Meaney,  "Britishness and Australian identity: The problem of nationalism in Australian history and historiography," ''Australian Historical Studies''  32.116 (2001): 76-90.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Gare, "Britishness in recent Australian historiography." ''Historical Journal'' 43#4 (2000): 1145-1155.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time the history wars were in play, professional history seemed in decline, and popular writers began reclaiming the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Drusilla Modjeska|title=The Best Australian Essays 2006|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6UBV5f0LThoC&amp;pg=PA101|year=2006|publisher=Black Inc.|pages=100–1|isbn=9781863952781}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outline==
{{outdated section|date=August 2016}} 
In 1968 Professor [[Bill Stanner|W. E. H. "Bill" Stanner]], an Australian [[anthropology|anthropologist]], coined the term the "Great Australian Silence" in a [[Boyer Lectures|Boyer Lecture]] entitled "After the Dreaming",&lt;ref name=Stanner-198-248&gt;Stanner pp. 198-248&lt;/ref&gt; where he argued that the writing of [[History of Australia|Australian history]] was incomplete. He asserted that Australian national history as documented up to that point had largely been presented in a positive light, but that [[Indigenous Australians]] had been virtually ignored. He saw this as a structural and deliberate process to omit "several hundred thousand Aboriginal people who lived and died between 1788 and 1938 ... (who were but) ... negative facts of history and ... were in no way consequential for the modern period".&lt;ref&gt;Stanner, p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; A new strand of Australian [[historiography]] subsequently emerged which gave much greater attention to the negative experiences of Indigenous Australians during the [[History of Australia (1788-1850)|British settlement of Australia]]. In the 1970s and 1980s, historians such as [[Manning Clark]] and [[Henry Reynolds (historian)|Henry Reynolds]] published work which they saw as correcting a selective historiography that had misrepresented or ignored Indigenous Australian history.  The historian [[Geoffrey Blainey]] argued in the literary and political journal ''[[Quadrant (magazine)|Quadrant]]'' in 1993 that the telling of Australian history had moved from an unduly positive rendition (the "Three Cheers View") to an unduly negative view (The "[[#Black armband debate|'black armband']]") and Australian commentators and politicians have continued to debate this subject.

Interpretations of Aboriginal history became part of the wider political debate sometimes called the ''[[#History wars and culture wars|'culture wars']]'' during the tenure of the [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] government from 1996–2007, with the [[Prime Minister of Australia]] [[John Howard]] publicly championing the views of some of those associated with ''Quadrant''.&lt;ref name="Manne11/08"&gt; [http://www.themonthly.com.au/tm/node/1293 [[Robert Manne]], "What is Rudd’s Agenda?", ''[[The Monthly]]'', November 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt; This debate extended into a [[#National Museum of Australia controversy|controversy]] over the way history was presented in the [[National Museum of Australia]] and in [[high school]] history curricula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Guy Rundle writes: |url=http://www.crikey.com.au/2007/06/28/1915-and-all-that-history-in-a-holding-pattern/ |title=1915 and all that: History in a holding pattern – Crikey |publisher=Crikey.com.au |date=28 June 2007 |accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Justine Ferrari, Education writer |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24492542-13881,00.html |title=History curriculum author defies his critics to find bias |publisher=Theaustralian.news.com.au |date=14 October 2008 |accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also migrated into the general Australian media, with regular opinion pieces being published in major [[broadsheet]]s such as ''[[The Australian]]'', ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' and ''[[The Age]]''. [[Marcia Langton]] has referred to much of this wider debate as 'war porn'&lt;ref&gt;Baudrillard J. War porn. ''Journal of Visual Culture'', Vol. 5, No. 1, 86-88 (2006) {{doi|10.1177/147041290600500107}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an 'intellectual dead end'.&lt;ref name="Langton" &gt;Langton M. Essay: Trapped in the aboriginal reality show.  ''Griffith Review 2007'', 19:Re-imagining Australia.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two Australian Prime Ministers, Paul Keating and John Howard, were major participants in the "wars". According to the analysis for the Australian Parliamentary Library of Dr Mark McKenna,&lt;ref name="McKenna"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/RP9798/98RP05 |title=M. McKenna, (1997). "Different Perspectives on Black Armband History: Research Paper 5 1997-98". Parliament of Australia: Parliamentary Library |publisher=Aph.gov.au |date= |accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Keating]] (1991–1996) was believed by [[John Howard]] (1996–2007) to portray Australia pre-[[Gough Whitlam|Whitlam]] in an unduly negative light; while Keating sought to distance the modern [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] movement from its historical support for the Monarchy and the [[White Australia policy]] by arguing that it was the Conservative Australian Parties who had been barriers to national progress and excessively loyal to the British Empire. He accused Britain of having abandoned Australia during World War II. Keating was a staunch advocate of a symbolic apology to indigenous people for the misdeeds of past governments, and outlined his view of the origins and potential solutions to contemporary Aboriginal disadvantage in his [[Redfern Park Speech]] (drafted with the assistance of historian [[Don Watson]]). In 1999, following the release of the 1998 [[Bringing Them Home]] Report, Howard passed a Parliamentary [[Motion of Reconciliation]] describing treatment of Aboriginal people as the "most blemished chapter" in Australian history, but he did not make a Parliamentary apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thinkingfaith.org/articles/20080221_1.htm |title=The History of Apologies Down Under [Thinking Faith - the online journal of the British Jesuits&amp;#93; |publisher=Thinkingfaith.org |date= |accessdate=27 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141202000730/http://www.thinkingfaith.org/articles/20080221_1.htm |archivedate=2 December 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Howard argued that an apology was inappropriate as it would imply "intergeneration guilt" and said that "practical" measures were a better response to contemporary Aboriginal disadvantage. Keating has argued for the eradication of remaining symbols linked to British origins: including deference for [[ANZAC Day]], the [[Australian Flag]] and the [[Monarchy in Australia]], while Howard was a supporter of these institutions. Unlike fellow Labor leaders and contemporaries, [[Bob Hawke]] and [[Kim Beazley]], Keating never traveled to [[Gallipoli]] for ANZAC Day ceremonies. In 2008 he described those who gathered there as "misguided".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/a-nation-reborn-at-anzac-cove-utter-nonsense-keating-20081030-5enw.html |title=A nation reborn at Anzac Cove?

In 2006, John Howard said in a speech to mark the 50th anniversary of ''Quadrant'' that "Political Correctness" was dead in Australia but: "we should not underestimate the degree to which the soft-left still holds sway, even dominance, especially in Australia's universities"; and in 2006, ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' Political Editor [[Peter Hartcher]] reported that Opposition foreign affairs spokesman [[Kevin Rudd]] was entering the philosophical debate by arguing in response that "John Howard, is guilty of perpetrating 'a fraud' in his so-called culture wars ... designed not to make real change but to mask the damage inflicted by the Government's economic policies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/pms-culture-wars-a-fraud-rudd/2006/10/27/1161749320974.html |title=PM's culture wars a fraud: Rudd - National |publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |date= 28 October 2006|accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The defeat of the Howard government in the Australian Federal election of 2007, and its replacement by the [[First Rudd Government|Rudd Labor government]] altered the dynamic of the debate. Rudd made an official apology to the ''[[Stolen Generation]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/02/12/australia.text/index.html |title=Full text of Australia's apology to Aboriginal people |publisher=CNN.com |date=12 February 2008 |accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with bi-partisan support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/brendan-nelsons-sorry-speech/2008/02/13/1202760366050.html |title=Brendan Nelson's sorry speech - National |publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=13 February 2008 |accessdate=27 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127074319/http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/brendan-nelsons-sorry-speech/2008/02/13/1202760366050.html |archivedate=27 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Keating, Rudd supported an Australian Republic, but in contrast to Keating, Rudd declared support for the [[Australian flag]] and supported the commemoration of [[ANZAC Day]] and expressed admiration for Liberal Party founder [[Robert Menzies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/keating-utterly-wrong-on-gallipoli-pm/story-0-1111117908459 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120912154538/http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/keating-utterly-wrong-on-gallipoli-pm/story-0-1111117908459 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-09-12 |title=Paul Keating 'utterly wrong' to reject Gallipoli identity, says Kevin Rudd |publisher=The Australian |date=2008-10-31 |accessdate=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/is-rudd-having-a-bob-each-way/2007/04/12/1175971263000.html |title=Is Rudd having a Bob each way? - Opinion |publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=28 October 2004 |accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the change of government and the passage, with support from all parties, of a Parliamentary apology to indigenous Australians, Professor of Australian Studies Richard Nile argued: "the culture and history wars are over and with them should also go the adversarial nature of intellectual debate",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blogs.theaustralian.news.com.au/richardnile/index.php/theaustralian/comments/end_of_the_culture_wars |title=End of the culture wars &amp;#124; Richard Nile Blog, ''The Australian'' |publisher=Blogs.theaustralian.news.com.au |date=28 November 2007 |accessdate=27 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309215605/http://blogs.theaustralian.news.com.au/richardnile/index.php/theaustralian/comments/end_of_the_culture_wars/ |archivedate=9 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; a view contested by others, including conservative commentator [[Janet Albrechtsen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22908896-7583,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212124342/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0%2C25197%2C22908896-7583%2C00.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=12 December 2007 |title=The Australian |date=12 December 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an intention to reengage in the history wars was indicated by then-Federal Opposition member [[Christopher Pyne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Julia Baird |url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?&amp;docID=SMH130427114V71OBPNC |title=Don't dismiss nation's blemishes |publisher=Sydney Morning Herald |date=2013-04-27 |accessdate=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Black armband / white blindfold debate==
The black armband debate concerns whether or not accounts of Australian history gravitate towards an overly negative or an overly positive point of view. The ''black armband view of [[History of Australia|history]]'' was a phrase first used by Australian [[historian]] [[Geoffrey Blainey]] in his 1993 ''Sir [[John Latham (jurist)|John Latham]] Memorial Lecture'' to describe views of history which, he believed, posited that "much of [pre-multicultural] Australian history had been a disgrace" and which focused mainly on the treatment of minority groups (especially Aboriginal people). This he contrasted with the '' 'Three Cheers' '' view, according to which: "nearly everything that came after [the convict era] was believed to be pretty good". Blainey argued that both such accounts of Australian history were inaccurate: "The Black Armband view of history might well represent the swing of the pendulum from a position that had been too favourable, too self congratulatory, to an opposite extreme that is even more unreal and decidedly jaundiced."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/RP/1997-98/98rp05.htm M. McKenna, (10 November 1997), Research Paper 5 1997-98: "Different Perspectives on Black Armband History, Parliament of Australia, Parliamentary Library] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404113845/http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/RP/1997-98/98rp05.htm |date=4 April 2009 }} "To some extent my generation was reared on the Three Cheers view of history. This patriotic view of our past had a long run. It saw Australian history as largely a success. While the convict era was a source of shame or unease, nearly everything that came after was believed to be pretty good. There is a rival view, which I call the Black Armband view of history. In recent years it has assailed the optimistic view of history. The black armbands were quietly worn in official circles in 1988. The multicultural folk busily preached their message that until they arrived much of Australian history was a disgrace. The past treatment of Aboriginal people, of Chinese, of Kanakas, of non-British migrants, of women, the very old, the very young, and the poor was singled out, sometimes legitimately, sometimes not. My friend and undergraduate teacher Manning Clark, who was almost the official historian in 1988, had done much to spread the gloomy view and also the compassionate view with his powerful prose and Old Testament phrases.

The Black Armband view of history might well represent the swing of the pendulum from a position that had been too favourable, too self congratulatory, to an opposite extreme that is even more unreal and decidedly jaundiced."&lt;/ref&gt;

The lecture was subsequently published in the political and literary journal, ''[[Quadrant (magazine)|Quadrant]]'',&lt;ref name = "QuadrantBlainey1993"&gt;[[Geoffrey Blainey]], 'Drawing Up a Balance Sheet of Our History', in [[Quadrant (magazine)|Quadrant]], vol.37 ( 7-8), July/August 1993&lt;/ref&gt; which at the time was edited by [[Robert Manne]] and is now edited by [[Keith Windschuttle]], two of the leading "history warriors", albeit on opposing sides of the debate. The phrase then began to be used by some commentators [[pejorative]]ly to describe historians viewed as writing excessively critical Australian [[history of Australia|history]] "while wearing a black [[armband]]" of "mourning and grieving, or [[shame]]". New interpretations of Australia's history since 1788 were contested for focussing almost exclusively on official and unofficial [[imperialism]], [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]], ill treatment, [[colonialism|colonial]] dispossession and [[cultural genocide]] and ignoring positive aspects of Australia's history.&lt;ref name="McKenna" /&gt; [[Manning Clark]] was named by Blainey in his 1993 speech as having "done much to spread the gloomy view and also the compassionate view with his powerful prose and Old Testament phrases".&lt;ref name = "QuadrantBlainey1993"/&gt; &lt;!--this ref given as cited in McKenna--&gt;

The [[Howard Government]]'s responses to the question of how to recount Australian history were initially formulated in the context of [[Paul Keating]]'s characterisation of the subject. [[John Howard]] argued in a 1996 [[Sir Robert Menzies Lecture]] that the "balance sheet of Australian history" had come to be misrepresented:
{{quote|The 'black armband' view of our history reflects a belief that most Australian history since 1788 has been little more than a disgraceful story of imperialism, exploitation, racism, sexism and other forms of discrimination. ... I believe that the balance sheet of our history is one of heroic achievement and that we have achieved much more as a nation of which we can be proud than of which we should be ashamed.

In 2009, Howard's successor [[Kevin Rudd]] also called for moving away from a ''black-arm view'':

{{quote|Time to leave behind us the polarisation that began to infect our every discussion of our nation's past. To go beyond the so-called "black arm" view that refused to confront some hard truths about our past, as if our forebears were all men and women of absolute nobility, without spot or blemish. But time, too, to go beyond the view that we should only celebrate the reformers, the renegades and revolutionaries, thus neglecting or even deriding the great stories of our explorers, of our pioneers, and of our entrepreneurs.

[[Stephen Muecke]], currently Professor of Writing at the [[University of New South Wales]], contributed to the debate by arguing that black armband events bring people together in common remembrance and cited [[Anzac Day]] as an example; while Aboriginal lawyer [[Noel Pearson]] argued that whilst there was much that is worth preserving in the cultural heritage of non-Aboriginal Australia, "To say that ordinary Australians who are part of the national community today do not have any connection with the shameful aspects of our past is at odds with our exhortations that they have connections to the prideful bits".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Library/pubs/rp/1997-98/98rp05.htm#ORIGINS |title=Australian Parliamentary Library - Research Paper 5 1997-98 |publisher=Aph.gov.au |date= |accessdate=27 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404113845/http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/rp/1997-98/98rp05.htm |archivedate=4 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of the ''{{'}}white blindfold{{'}}'' view of [[History of Australia|history]] entered the debate as a pejorative counter-response to the notion of the "black armband school".&lt;ref name=white-blindfold&gt;[[Anna Clark (historian)|Clark, Anna]].

In his book ''Why Weren't We Told?'' in 1999, [[Henry Reynolds (historian)|Henry Reynolds]] referred to [[William Edward Hanley Stanner|Stanner]]'s "Great Australian Silence", and to "a 'mental block' which prevented Australians from coming to terms with the past".&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds (1999), p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that the silence about [[Australian frontier wars|Australia's history of frontier violence]] in much of the twentieth century stands in stark contrast with the openness with which violence was admitted and discussed in the nineteenth. Reynolds quotes many excerpts from the press, including an article written in the ''[[Townsville]] Herald'' in Queensland as late as 1907, by a "pioneer" who described his part in a massacre. Reynolds commented that violence against Aboriginals, far from being hushed up or denied, was openly talked about.

The nature of the debate began to change in 1999 with the publication of a book ''Massacre Myth'' by journalist, [[Rod Moran]], who examined the 1926 [[Forrest River massacre]] in Western Australia. Moran concluded that the massacre was a myth inspired by the false claims of a missionary (possibly as a result of mental health issues).&lt;ref&gt;Moran, Rod (1999) ''Massacre myth: an investigation into allegations concerning the mass murder of Aboriginal people at Forrest River, 1926'' Bassendean, W.A.

''Quadrant'', 1 July 2003&lt;/ref&gt; [[Keith Windschuttle]], an Australian historian, said that reviewing Moran's book inspired his own examination of the wider historical record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sydneyline.com/UNSW%20debate.htm |title=The Sydney Line |publisher=The Sydney Line |date=29 May 2003 |accessdate=27 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110223082820/http://www.sydneyline.com/UNSW%20debate.htm |archivedate=23 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Windschuttle argues that much of Australian Aboriginal history, particularly as written since the late 1970s, was based on the use of questionable or unreliable evidence and on deliberate misrepresentation and fabrication of historical evidence. He based his conclusions on his examination of the evidence cited in previous historical accounts and reported incidences of non-existent documents being cited, misquoting and misleadingly selective quoting from documents and of documents being cited as evidence that certain events took place when his examination concluded that they do not support those claims. Windschuttle reported his conclusions in a number of articles published in Quadrant and in 2002, he published a book, ''The Fabrication of Aboriginal History'', Volume 1, Van Diemen’s Land 1803-1847, which focussed on Tasmanian colonial history.

Historian Geoffrey Blainey argued in a 2003 book review of Fabrication,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/nativefiction-1774 |title=Native fiction by Geoffrey Blainey |publisher=The New Criterion |date= |accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the number of instances when the source documents do not support the claims made and the fact that the divergences overwhelmingly tend to purport claims of violent conflict and massacres indicates that this is not a matter of mere error but bias.

The debate had therefore changed from an argument over whether there was an excessive focus on negative aspects of Australian history to one over to what extent, if at all, Australian Aboriginal history had been based on questionable evidence or had been falsified or fabricated and whether this had exaggerated the extent of violence against Aboriginal people. Particular historians and histories that are challenged include [[Lyndall Ryan]] and [[Henry A. Reynolds|Henry Reynolds]] and the histories of massacres, particularly in [[Tasmania]] but also elsewhere in Australia. Windschuttle's naming of historians whom he accused of misrepresentation and fabrication of the historical evidence, created considerable controversy and produced a range of responses including condemnation of as well as support for his work.&lt;ref&gt;Attwood, Bain (2005).

==Genocide debate==&lt;!-- The redirect [[Australian genocide debate]] links to this section--&gt;
{{See also|Genocide definitions}}
The case for using the term "Australian genocide" rests on evidence from various sources that people argue proves some form of genocide. People cite the [[list of massacres of indigenous Australians]] by white settlers, mainly in the 19th century (cf. ''Blood on the Wattle'' by Bruce Elder or ''Frontier History Revisited'' by Robert Orsted-Jensen); only a few massacres were documented, and the evidence is strong that evidence of massacres was generally covered by secrecy and there are powerful signs that documents had been destroyed. Evidence is solid that Queensland's Native Police produced diaries, collision reports and monthly and quarterly enumerations of 'patrols' and 'collisions' with indigenous people, and that all of this material was stored in the Queensland police department. However, not one single sheet of information of this kind which is today available at the Queensland State archive originate from files delivered by the police department, the material left comes solely from other government offices. Only human interference can produce a total loss of the vast Native Police Force records once stored in the Queensland Police Department.&lt;ref&gt;see Orsted-Jensen, R: 'Frontier History Revisited', page 253pp (Appendix B 'The Lost Native Police Reports')&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have pointed to the dramatic reduction in the Tasmanian Aboriginal population in the 19th century and the forced removal of generations of Aboriginal children from their parents during the 20th century as evidence of genocide. The evidence includes documentation of the wish, and sometimes intention, of a significant proportion of late 19th-century and early 20th-century white Australians to see the Aboriginal "race" eliminated. Documents include published letters to the editors of high-circulation newspapers. Certainly this was the case in Queensland, in terms of indigenous people the most populated section of Australia and certainly the colony with the most violent frontier. In June 1866 Sir [[Robert Herbert]] summing up his experience after little more than five years as the first Premier of this colony wrote:

{{quote|Every method of dealing with these very dangerous savages has been tried, and I believe no more satisfactory system can be devised than that under which the people of Queensland endeavour to deal with a difficulty which it is feared can never terminate except with the gradual disappearance of the unimprovable race.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Knox: ''The Queensland Years of Robert Herbert, Premier'' St Lucia QUP 1977, page 236.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The mentioned "system", for which Herbert was among the people personal responsible, was the so-called "[[Native Police]] system" which typically went about "dispersing" any sign of indigenous resistance at the frontier by use of deadly early morning attacks on Aboriginal camps. This semi-military force was allowed to go about its business, typically instigating large scale deadly retaliation without prior investigating of alleged crime. They generally took no prisoners at the frontier and there are no signs that they ever enforced any other "law" than "might is right". It was a force designed more in the manner of the recent times phenomenon known as the "death-squad" and the secrecy of its operations was ensured by the remoteness of its operations, added a system that denied the evidence from "blacks" while the force itself was instructed to ensure that there would always be only one white witness, the officer in charge of each detachment. Recently the first ever attempt to scientifically calculate the amount of Aboriginal people killed in encounters with the Native Police indicates that numbers may exceed 45,000.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Evans, Raymond &amp; Ørsted–Jensen, Robert: 'I Cannot Say the Numbers that Were Killed': Assessing Violent Mortality on the Queensland Frontier" (paper at AHA 9 July 2014 at University of Queensland) publisher Social Science Research Network&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "useless race" was commonly expressed in Queensland such as in 1877 when an editorial in the leading journal noted that,

{{quote|The desire for progressive advancement and substantial prosperity is, after all, stronger than sentimental dislike to the extinction of a savage and useless race.&lt;ref&gt;Queenslander 7 October 1876, page 12&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Classifying Aboriginal people as a useless or unimprovable race was common. Comprehensively debating the native police and the frontier in public in 1880 in the columns of the ''Queenslander'' (the weekly edition of the colony's leading journal), one could read the following statements from yet another prominent settler,

{{quote|And being a useless race, what does it matter what they suffer any more than the distinguished philanthropist who writes in this behalf cares for the wounded half dead pigeon he tortures at his shooting matches.&lt;ref&gt;''Queenslander'' 8 May 1880, page 594-95&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Remarks which were followed up in October of that years by [[Boyd Dunlop Morehead]], one of the leading landholders, manager of the Scottish Australian Investment Co.'s ''Bowen Downs'' in 1866-81 and a future Premier, could be heard making the following acknowledgement in a parliamentary speech, saying, yes settlers in the past did go

{{quote|...&amp;nbsp;out, and in their pioneering had, of necessity, to use extreme measures to the inhabitants of the soil. The aboriginal, no doubt, had been shot down; no one denied it ... this race was being worked off the face of the earth. That that was so everyone knew, and that it must be so, none would deny ... For his own part he did not believe that the aboriginal race was worth preserving. If there were no aboriginals it would be a very good thing&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;Legislative Assembly on 21 October 1880, speech by the member for Mitchell, grazier, businessman, later Premier &amp; Colonial Secretary of Queensland.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After the introduction of the word "genocide" in the 1940s by [[Raphael Lemkin]], Lemkin himself and most comparative scholars of genocide and many general historians, such as [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]], [[Ward Churchill]], [[Leo Kuper]] and [[Jared Diamond]], basing their analysis on previously published histories, present the extinction of the Tasmanian Aboriginal people as a text book example of a genocide.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Reynolds, "Genocide in Tasmania?", in A. Dirk Moses (ed.) ''Genocide and settler society: frontier violence and stolen indigenous children in Australian history'', Berghahn Books, 2004 p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian historian of genocide, [[Ben Kiernan]], in his recent history of the concept and practice, ''Blood and soil: a world history of genocide and extermination from Sparta to Darfur'' (2007), treats the Australian evidence over the first century of colonization as an example of genocide.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Kiernan, "Genocidal Violence in Nineteenth-Century Australia", in his ''Blood and soil: a world history of genocide and extermination from Sparta to Darfur'' Yale University Press, 2007, pp. 249-309.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among scholars specializing in Australian history much recent debate has focused on whether indeed what happened to groups of [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] people, and especially the [[Tasmanian Aboriginal people]], during the European colonisation of Australia can be classified as genocide. According to Mark Levene, most Australian experts are now "considerably more circumspect".&lt;ref&gt;Mark Levene, ''Genocide in the Age of the Nation State: The rise of the West and the coming of genocide'', I.

However, in practice the events on the ground that lead to their virtual extinction worked out.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5zHAGNPTkqIC&amp;pg=PA127&amp;dq=Tasmanian+Genocide Henry Reynolds, "Genocide in Tasmania?"] in A.

While calling for "a more robust exchange between genocide and Tasmanian historical scholarship",{{sfn|Curthoys|2008|p=247}} her own view is that the Tasmanian instance constitutes a "case for genocide, though not of state planning, mass killing, or extinction".{{sfn|Curthoys|2008|p=230}}

Much of the debate on whether European colonisation of Australia resulted in genocide, centres on whether "the term 'genocide' only applies to cases of deliberate mass killings of Aboriginal people by European settlers, or ... might also apply to instances in which many Aboriginal people were killed by the reckless or unintended actions and omissions of settlers".&lt;ref name=Australian-debate-on-genocide&gt;[http://www.hyperhistory.org/index.php?option=displaypage&amp;Itemid=364&amp;op=page#arti "Debates on Genocide - Part One Debates on 'Genocide' in Australian History"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112193203/http://www.hyperhistory.org/index.php?option=displaypage&amp;Itemid=364&amp;op=page |date=12 January 2016 }}, Australian Government Department of Education Science and Training&lt;/ref&gt; Historians such as Tony Barta argue that for the victim group it matters little if they were wiped out as part of a planned attack.

[[Henry Reynolds (historian)|Henry Reynolds]] points out that European colonists and their descendants frequently use expressions that included "extermination", "extinction", and "extirpation" when discussing the treatment of Aboriginal people during the colonial period, and as in his opinion genocide "can take many forms, not all of them violent".&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.hyperhistory.org/index.php?option=displaypage&amp;Itemid=364&amp;op=page#arti "Debates on Genocide - Part One Debates on "Genocide" in Australian History"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112193203/http://www.hyperhistory.org/index.php?option=displaypage&amp;Itemid=364&amp;op=page |date=12 January 2016 }}, Australian Government Department of Education Science and Training. citing Reynolds, ''An Indelible Stain?

== Controversy over smallpox in Australia ==

The arrival of [[smallpox]] in Australia is of uncertain origin and is a major theme in the history wars. The lack of immunity among Aboriginal Australians to this introduced disease saw it inflict a devastating toll on the Aboriginal population. Though the [[First Fleet]] itself did not arrive with any known carriers of the disease, the observation of an epidemic among the Aboriginal population of Sydney around 16 months after the British arrived has led to speculation that the Fleet itself brought this disease to Australia. Some historians have suggested that the disease may have been either released by accident or theft of medicine stores or perhaps been deliberately employed as a form of "[[germ warfare]]" against indigenous Australians. [[Inoculation]] was thus commonly practised by surgeons decades before 1796 and the process of [[smallpox vaccination]] was introduced by [[Edward Jenner]]. Dried scab was commonly stored in glass containers as part of a surgeons remedies.&lt;ref&gt;Butlin, Noel: ''Our Original Aggression'', Sydney 1983, p19-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early speculation on the origins of the disease is recorded in the writing of a [[First Fleet]] Captain of Marines, [[Watkin Tench]], who noted an "extraordinary calamity" among the Aboriginal people of Sydney, beginning in April 1789. Repeated accounts of dead bodies marked with pustules consistent with smallpox began being reported around [[Sydney Harbour]] around this time. Tench wrote that the colonists' observations had led them to suppose that smallpox was not known in [[New South Wales]] and as no [[First Fleet]]ers had suffered from the disease, its sudden existence among the Aboriginal people was "inexplicable". Tench speculated as to whether the disease might be indigenous to the country; or whether it had been brought to the colony by the French expedition of [[Jean-François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse|Lapérouse]] a year before; traversed the continent from the West where Europeans had previously landed; brought by expedition of [[James Cook]]; or indeed by the first British settlers at Sydney. "Our surgeons brought out varioulous matter in bottles", he wrote, "but to infer that it was produced from this cause were a supposition so wild as to be unworthy of consideration".&lt;ref&gt;Watkin Tench; ''1788: Edited and Introduced by Tim Flannery"; The Text Publishing Company; Melbourne; 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, and despite the lack of certainty over how or when the disease reached Australia, there has been a history war regarding the way that smallpox arrived in Australia, especially whether it was deliberately used as a crude [[biological weapon]] against indigenous peoples.

Medical scientists such as Sir [[Edward Stirling]] and Sir [[John Burton Cleland|John Cleland]] published a number of books and articles between 1911 and 1966 suggesting that smallpox arrived in Northern Australia from an Asian source.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, Dr Josephine, The Original Australians, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

A rival theory, that smallpox was introduced to NSW in 1789 by British settlers, was put forward in 1914 by the director of the [[Australian Quarantine Service]], Dr [[John Cumpston|J.&amp;nbsp;H.&amp;nbsp;L. Cumpston]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1908"&gt;Cumpston, JHL "The History of Small-Pox in Australia 1788–1908", Government Printer (1914) Melb.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, Professor [[Noel Butlin]], an economic historian, suggested: "it is possible and, in 1789, likely, that infection of the Aboriginal people was a deliberate extermination act". Historians David Day and Henry Reynolds repeated Butlin’s claims and in 2001 Reynolds wrote: "one possibility is that the epidemic was deliberately or accidentally let loose by someone in the settlement at Sydney Cove. Not surprisingly this is a highly contentious proposition. If true, it would clearly fall within the ambit of the Genocide Convention".&lt;ref&gt;Flood, Dr Josephine, The Original Australians: Story of the Aboriginal People, published by Allen &amp; Unwin, 2006, p125.&lt;/ref&gt; Butlin argued that while Macassan fishermen could possibly 'have landed the virus on the Australian mainland at some stage their ability to do so was limited'.&lt;ref&gt;Butlin: ''Our Original Aggression'', p.20&lt;/ref&gt; It is furthermore highly unlikely, he argued, that this virus should have been brought down from the Gulf of Carpentaria to coincidence with the first major outbreak "just fifteen months after the landing of the first fleet". Besides the time factor connected to Macassans, 'over seven or eight weeks (or more)', the type of vessels, the limited potential for contact between Aboriginal people and fishermen, and the fact of clothing as carrier and virus is destroyed or seriously reduced in contact with salt water, makes the Macassan theory highly unlikely, he argued. Indeed, infected 'Macassans would be either dead or fully recovered long before reaching the Gulf of Carpentaria.&lt;ref&gt;Butlin: Our Original Aggression, p.32&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas transfer somehow, theft accident or the like, from scab originally stored in glass containers carried by just one of the seven medical officers on the first fleet seems the most likely cause.&lt;ref&gt;Butlin: ''Our Original Aggression'', p.19-20 &amp; 29-37.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[C. C. Macknight|C.&amp;nbsp;C. Macknight]] (1986) an authority on the centuries-old [[Makassar#Contact with Australia|interaction between indigenous Australians and the people of Makassar]] (later part of Indonesia), revived the theory that smallpox was introduced to Australia by [[Makassan contact with Australia|Macassan mariners visiting Arnhem Land]].&lt;ref&gt;Macknight, C.&amp;nbsp;C.

Australian virologist [[Frank Fenner]] (1988) – who in 1977–80 led the successful [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) campaign to eradicate smallpox and was the principal author of a 1988 WHO report, ''Smallpox and its Eradication'' – pointed out that no cases of smallpox were reported amongst convicts, sailors, military personnel, or free settlers, on the First Fleet.&lt;ref name= Fenner1/&gt; The virus was also not reported among British or Aboriginal people at Port Jackson over the following 15 months. It was, therefore, unlikely that a person suffering from smallpox and travelling with the First Fleet had caused the 1789 outbreak.

While there were cases of smallpox in Macassar during 1789, there are no reports of it occurring prior to that period. However, [[History of smallpox#Island South East Asia|smallpox had long been present in island South East Asia]] – possibly as early the [[4th century]] according to Frank Fenner.&lt;ref&gt;Fenner, cited by Victor T. King, 1998, ''Environmental Challenges in South-East Asia'', London/New York, Routledge, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; There were outbreaks of smallpox in Indonesia throughout the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;King, ''Environmental Challenges in South-East Asia'', pp. 78–79; M. C. Ricklefs, 1993, ''A History of Modern Indonesia Since c. 1200'', Basingstoke, Palgrave Macmillan, pp. 72, 85, and; Atsushi Ōta, 2006, ''Changes of Regime and Social Dynamics in West Java: Society, State and the Outer World of Banten, 1750-1830'', Leiden, Brill, pp. 79, 109, 113.&lt;/ref&gt; These included, for example, major epidemics in the [[Sultanate of Tidore]] (in the Moluccas) during the 1720s, the [[Sultanate of Banjar]] (South Kalimantan), in 1734, 1750–51, 1764–65 and 1778–79;  and in southern [[Sumatra]] during the 1750s, the 1770s, and in 1786. Macassans had contact with these areas both directly and indirectly (through foreign traders and invaders).

[[David Day (historian)|David Day]] (2001) reiterated Butlin's argument and suggested that members of Sydney's garrison of [[Royal Marines]] may have attempted to use smallpox as a biological weapon in 1789.&lt;ref&gt;David Day, ''Claiming a Continent A New History of Australia'', HarperCollins, Sydney, 2001, p. 42f.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, however, John Connor stated that Day's theory was "unsustainable".&lt;ref&gt;John Connor, ''The Australian Frontier Wars, 1788-1838'', UNSW Press, 2002, p29.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2002 book, ''Invisible Invaders'', historian [[Judy Campbell (historian)|Judy Campbell]] &amp;ndash; advised by Fenner &amp;ndash; reviewed reports of disease amongst Aboriginal people from 1780–1880, including the smallpox epidemics of 1789-90, the 1830s and the 1860s. Campbell argues that the evidence, including that contained in these reports shows that, while many diseases such as tuberculosis ''were'' introduced by British colonists, this was not so for smallpox and that the speculations of British responsibility made by other historians were based on tenuous evidence, largely on the mere coincidence that the 1789-90 epidemic was first observed afflicting the Aboriginal people not long after the establishment of the first British settlement. Campbell argues instead that the north-south route of transmission of the 1860s epidemics (which is generally agreed), also applied in the earlier ones. Campbell noted that the fleets of fast Macassan fishing vessels, propelled by monsoonal winds, reached Australia after being at sea for as little as ten to fifteen days, well within the incubation period of smallpox. The numbers of people travelling in the fleets were large enough to sustain smallpox for extended periods of time without it ‘burning out’.  The Macassans spent up to six months fishing along the northern Australian coastline and Aboriginal people had "day-to-day contact with the islanders. Aboriginals visited the praus and the camps the visitors set up on shore, they talked and traded…" &lt;ref&gt;''Invisible Invaders: Smallpox and Other Diseases in Aboriginal Australia 1780 - 1880'', by Judy Campbell, Melbourne University Press, 2002, pp. 73-74&lt;/ref&gt; She also notes that Butlin, writing in 1983, "did not recognize that Aboriginals were "great travellers", who spread infection over long distances…." and that smallpox was spread through their extensive social and trading contacts as well as by Aboriginal people fleeing from the disease.&lt;ref&gt;''Invisible Invaders: Smallpox and Other Diseases in Aboriginal Australia 1780 - 1880'', by Judy Campbell, Melbourne University Press, 2002, pp. 61, 181&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell also cited British historian [[Charles Wilson (historian)|Charles Wilson]], who cited "medical microbiology" in disagreeing with Butlin about the origins of the 1789 outbreak, and "doubted his estimates of its demographic impact", as well as "First Fleet historian [[Alan Frost]] [who] also disagreed with Butlin’s views".&lt;ref&gt;''Invisible Invaders: Smallpox and Other Diseases in Aboriginal Australia 1780 - 1880'', by Judy Campbell, Melbourne University Press, 2002, p 31&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christopher Warren]] (2007) claimed that Fenner did not address the issue of [[variolous material]] brought in bottles by the First Fleet, for use as an inoculant.&lt;ref&gt;Warren C., "Could First Fleet smallpox infect Aborigines? - A note", ''Aboriginal History 31'', pp. 152-164.&lt;/ref&gt; Warren argued that, even if the variolous material was degraded, it could still infect susceptible people. Smallpox spread by the inhalation of airborne droplets of virus in situations of personal contact or by contact with blankets, clothing or other objects that an infected person had recently used.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, Dr Josephine, ''The Original Australians'', pp. 125-126.&lt;/ref&gt;  This material was carried by First Fleet surgeons for inoculation purposes. Warren also suggested that Frost's view was based on a false premise: that the First Fleet's stocks of virus were sterilised by summer heat.

Craig Mear (2008) and Michael J. Bennett (2009) have disputed Campbell's hypothesis that smallpox was introduced to Australia in 1789 through contact between Aboriginal people and mariners from Makassar.&lt;ref&gt;''Invisible Invaders: Smallpox and Other Diseases in Aboriginal Australia 1780 - 1880'', by Judy Campbell, Melbourne University Press, 2002, pp. 55, 61&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Craig Mear, [http://www.abc.net.au/rn/ockhamsrazor/stories/2009/2557307.htm The origin of the smallpox outbreak in Sydney in 1789].

Hist. Med. 83(1)'', Spring 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[H. A. Willis]] (2010), in a survey of much of the literature discussed above, reiterated the argument made by Campbell.&lt;ref name="willis 2010"&gt;{{Citation | author1=Willis, H. A | title=Poxy history [Smallpox and Aboriginal history.] | journal=Quadrant | date=September 2010 | volume=54 | issue=9 | pages=70–73 | issn=0033-5002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Warren (2011) suggested that Willis had not taken into account research on how heat affects the smallpox virus, cited by the World Health Organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Warren, C. | title=The 1789 Smallpox | journal=Quadrant | date=2011 | volume=55 | issue=4 | page=4 | issn=0033-5002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In reply,  Willis (2011) reiterated that his position was supported by a closer reading of [[Frank Fenner]]’s report to the [[World Health Organization]] (1988) and invited readers to consult that report online.&lt;ref name= Fenner1&gt;{{cite book |author=Fenner, Frank |title=Smallpox and Its Eradication (History of International Public Health, No. 6) |publisher=World Health Organization |location=Geneva |url= http://whqlibdoc.who.int/smallpox/9241561106.pdf |year=1988 |pages= |isbn=978-92-4-156110-5 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Willis, H.A. | title=Bringing Smallpox with the First Fleet | journal=Quadrant | date=2011 | volume=55 | issue=7–8 | page=2 | issn=0033-5002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Macknight re-entered the debate in 2011, declaring: "The overwhelming probability must be that it [smallpox] was introduced, like the later epidemics, by [Macassan] [[Trepanging|trepang]]ers on the north coast and spread across the continent to arrive in Sydney quite independently of the new settlement there."&lt;ref&gt;Macknight, Campbell "The view from Marege’: Australian knowledge of Macassar and the impact of the trepang industry across two centuries " in ''Aboriginal History'' | publication-date=2011 | volume=35 | pages=121–143.&lt;/ref&gt;

John Carmody, a professor of medicine, put forward an alternative theory (2013) suggesting that the 1789 epidemic may have been [[chickenpox]] rather than smallpox. Carmody pointed out that chickenpox could have taken a severe toll on a population with little hereditary or acquired immunological resistance.  With regard to smallpox, Carmody said: "There is absolutely no evidence to support any of the theories and some of them are fanciful and far-fetched." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/chickenpox-blamed-for-aboriginal-deaths-20130807-2rh3m.html |title=Chickenpox blamed for Aboriginal deaths |publisher=Canberratimes.com.au |date=2013-08-08 |accessdate=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://caepr.anu.edu.au/Seminars/13/Seminar-Topics%E2%80%94Series-2/07_8_Seminar.php |title=Archived copy |access-date=18 January 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202101013/http://caepr.anu.edu.au/Seminars/13/Seminar-Topics%E2%80%94Series-2/07_8_Seminar.php |archive-date=2 February 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Christopher Warren rejected suggestions that chickenpox has caused the 1789 epidemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=February 2016}} ''Journal of Australian Studies'' http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14443058.2013.849750#preview at endnote 3 of ''Smallpox at Sydney Cove - Who, When, Why?''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=February 2016}} [http://www.rusinsw.org.au/Papers/2014AU05.pdf ''United Service''], Journal of the Royal United Services Institute of New South Wales, vol. 65 (1), March 2014, pg. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Warren (2014) subsequently rejected the theory that the 1789 epidemic had originated from Macassar.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, Christopher: "Smallpox outbreak of Sydney's past" ''Ockhams Razor'' ABC Radio National, 2014. (Access: 18 February 2016) and;  "Smallpox at Sydney Cove - who, when, why?", ''Journal of Australian Studies'', http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14443058.2013.849750#preview. {{Full citation needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He claimed that there was no evidence of a major outbreak of smallpox in Macassar before 1789;&lt;ref&gt;Warren cites records from Macassan hospitals established by the Dutch East India Company and the results of research by P. Boomgaard, reported in his "Smallpox and Vaccination in Java 1780-1860: Medical Data as a Source for demographic History" in ''Dutch medicine in the Malay Archipelago 1816-1941 : articles presented at a symposium held in honor of Prof. Dr. D. de Moulin on the occasion of his retirement ...''

McCarthy, "Trade in Aboriginal Australia", ''Oceania'', (1929-40), and Dale Kerwin, ''Aboriginal Dreaming Paths and trading Routes: The Colonisation of the Australasian Economic Landscape'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; the Makassan theory was contradicted by Aboriginal oral tradition,&lt;ref&gt;Warren cites: Luise Hercus and Peter Sutton, eds. ''This is What Happened: Historical Narratives by Aborigines'' (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; and 1829 was the earliest point at which there was possible evidence that Makassans had been the source of a smallpox outbreak.

==Stolen Generations debate==
{{main article|Stolen Generations}}
Despite the lengthy and detailed findings set out in the 1997 ''[[Bringing Them Home]]'' report into the [[Stolen Generation]], which documented the removal of Aboriginal children from their families by Australian State and Federal government agencies and [[Christian Church|church]] missions, the nature and extent of the removals have been disputed within Australia, with some commentators questioning the findings contained in the report and asserting that the Stolen Generation has been exaggerated. Sir [[Ronald Wilson]], former President of the [[Australian Human Rights Commission|Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission]] and a Commissioner on the Inquiry, has stated that none of the more than 500 witnesses who appeared before the Inquiry were cross-examined. This has been the basis of criticism by the [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] Government&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/bbing/stories/s148775.htm Stolen Generations], ''Background Briefing'', [[ABC Radio National]], broadcast 2 July 2000.

"Betraying the victims: The ‘Stolen Generations’ Report", in IPA Backgrounder Vol. 10/1, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; published by the [[Institute of Public Affairs]] that was criticised in turn by the lawyer [[Hal Wootten]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/ILB/1998/44.html |last=Wootten |first=H |author-link=Hal Wootten |title=Ron Brunton and Bringing Them Home}} (1998) 4(12) Indigenous Law Bulletin 4.&lt;/ref&gt; An Australian Federal Government submission has questioned the conduct of the Commission which produced the report, arguing that the Commission failed to critically appraise or test the claims on which it based the report and failed to distinguish between those separated from their families "with and without consent, and with and without good reason". Not only has the number of children removed from their parents been questioned, but also the intent and effects of the government policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australianpolitics.com/issues/aborigines/2000-govt-submission-on-stolen-generations-summary.doc |title=House of Representatives Members – 45th Parliament 2016- |accessdate=2008-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216043345/http://www.australianpolitics.com/issues/aborigines/2000-govt-submission-on-stolen-generations-summary.doc |archivedate=16 February 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics, such as [[Andrew Bolt]], have questioned the very existence of the Stolen Generation. Bolt stated that it is a "preposterous and obscene" myth and that there was actually no policy in any state or territory at any time for the systematic removal of "half-caste" Aboriginal children. [[Robert Manne]] responded that Bolt did not address the documentary evidence demonstrating the existence of the Stolen Generations and that this is a clear case of [[historical revisionism (negationism)|historical]] [[denialism]].&lt;ref name=RM-The-Age&gt;Manne, Robert [http://www.theage.com.au/news/robert-manne/the-cruelty-of-denial/2006/09/08/1157222325367.html The cruelty of denial], [[The Age]], 9 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Bolt then challenged Manne to produce ten cases in which the evidence justified the claim that children were "stolen" as opposed to having been removed for reasons such as neglect, abuse, abandonment, etc. He argued that Manne did not respond and that this was an indication of unreliability of the claim that there was policy of systematic removal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ryan |first=Kelly |url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,19610693-25717,00.html |title=Be a Manne and name just 10 &amp;#124; Herald Sun |publisher=News.com.au |date=28 June 2006 |accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reply, Manne stated that he supplied a documented list of 250 names&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/robert-manne/the-cruelty-of-denial/2006/09/08/1157222325367.html?page=1 |title=The cruelty of denial - Robert Manne - Opinion |publisher=theage.com.au |date=9 September 2006 |accessdate=27 April 2010 | location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Robert |last=Manne |authorlink=Robert Manne |title=The Stolen Generations - a documentary collection |url=http://www.themonthly.com.au/Documents/stolen.pdf |work=[[The Monthly]] |date=3 September 2005 |accessdate=29 December 2007|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bolt stated that prior to a debate, Manne provided him with a list of 12 names that he was able to show during the debate was "a list of people abandoned, saved from abuse or voluntarily given up by their parents"; and that during the actual debate, Manne produced a list of 250 names without any details or documentation as to their circumstances. Bolt also stated that he was subsequently able to identify and ascertain the history of some of those on the list and was unable to find a case where there was evidence to justify the term ‘stolen’. He stated that one of the names on the list of allegedly stolen children was 13-year-old Dolly, taken into the care of the State after being "found seven months pregnant and penniless, working for nothing on a station".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.news.com.au/heraldsun/andrewbolt/index.php/heraldsun/comments/that_debate_last_night/ |title=That debate last night &amp;#124; Herald Sun Andrew Bolt Blog |publisher=Blogs.news.com.au |date= |accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bolt/Manne debate is a fair sample of the adversarial debating style in the area.  There is focus on individual examples as evidence for or against the existence of a policy, and little or no analysis of other documentary evidence such as legislative databases showing how the legal basis for removal varied over time and between jurisdictions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/special/indigenous/ |title=Australian Indigenous Law Library |publisher=AustLII |date=10 November 2009 |accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  or testimony from those who were called on to implement the policies,&lt;ref&gt;''Many Voices: Reflections on Experiences of Indigenous Child Separation'' National Library of Australia Oral History Project, 2002. http://www.nla.gov.au/pub/nlanews/2002/nov02/article3.html&lt;/ref&gt; which was also recorded in the ''[[Bringing Them Home]]'' report. A recent review of legal cases claims it is difficult for [[Stolen Generation]] claimants to challenge what was written about their situation at the time of removal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Buti |first=A |title=The Stolen generation and litigation revisited |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MULR/2008/13.html#Heading522}} (2008) 32(2) Melbourne University Law Review 382.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bringing Them Home|report]] also identified instances of official misrepresentation and deception, such as when caring and able parents were incorrectly described by Aboriginal Protection Officers as not being able to properly provide for their children, or when parents were told by government officials that their children had died, even though this was not the case.

The new Australian Government elected in 2007 issued an Apology similar to those that State Governments had issued at or about the time of the ''[[Bringing Them Home]]'' report ten years earlier. On 13 February 2008, [[Kevin Rudd]], [[Prime Minister of Australia]] moved a formal apology in the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]],&lt;ref name="apology5694"&gt;{{cite web|title=House of Representatives Official Hansard|url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/download/chamber/hansardr/2008-02-13/toc_pdf/5694-9.pdf|website=parlinfo.aph.gov.au|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia|accessdate=14 February 2016|format=PDF|date=13 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|167}} which was moved concurrently by the Leader of the Government in the [[Australian Senate|Senate]]{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}.

==Windschuttle's ''The Fabrication of Aboriginal History''==
In 2002, historian Keith Windschuttle, in his book ''The Fabrication of Aboriginal History, Volume One: Van Diemen's Land 1803-1847'', questions the [[historiography|historical evidence]] used to identify the number of Aboriginal people deliberately killed during European colonisation, especially focusing on the [[Black War]] in Tasmania. He argues that there is credible evidence for the violent deaths of only 118 Tasmanian Aboriginal people, as having been directly killed by the British, although there were undoubtedly an unquantifiable number of other deaths for which no evidence exists. He argues that the Tasmanian Aboriginal population was devastated by a lethal cocktail of introduced diseases to which they had little or no resistance due to their isolation from the mainland and the rest of humanity for thousands of years. The deaths and infertility caused by these introduced diseases, combined with the deaths from what violent conflict there was, rapidly decimated the relatively small Aboriginal population. Windschuttle also examined the nature of those violent episodes that did occur and concluded that there is no credible evidence of warfare over territory. Windschuttle argues that the primary source of conflict between the British and the Aboriginal people was raids by Aboriginal people, often involving violent attacks on settlers, to acquire goods (such as blankets, metal implements and 'exotic' foods) from the British. With this and with a detailed examination of footnotes in and evidence cited by the earlier historical works, he criticises the claims by historians such as [[Henry Reynolds (historian)|Henry Reynolds]] and Professor [[Lyndall Ryan]] that there was a campaign of guerrilla warfare against British settlement. Particular historians and histories that are challenged include Henry Reynolds and the histories of [[Wiktionary:massacre|massacres]], particularly in [[Tasmania]] (such as in the [[Cape Grim massacre]]) but also elsewhere in Australia. Windschuttle's claims are based upon the argument that the 'orthodox' view of Australian history were founded on hearsay or the misleading use of evidence by historians.

Windschuttle argues that, in order to advance the ‘deliberate genocide’ argument, Reynolds has misused source documentation, including that from British colonist sources, by quoting out of context. In particular, he accuses Reynolds of selectively quoting from responses to an 1830 survey in Tasmania in that Reynolds quoted only from those responses that could be construed as advocating "extermination", "extinction", and "extirpation" and failed to mention other responses to the survey, which indicated that a majority of respondents rejected genocide, were sympathetic to the plight of the Aboriginal people, feared that conflict arising from Aboriginal attacks upon settlers would result in the extinction of the Tasmanian Aboriginal people and advocated the adoption of courses of action to prevent this happening.&lt;ref&gt;Windschuttle, pp. 326-350.&lt;/ref&gt;

Windschuttle's claims and research have been disputed by some historians, in ''Whitewash. On Keith Windschuttle's Fabrication of Aboriginal History'', an anthology including contributions from [[Henry Reynolds (historian)|Henry Reynolds]] and Professor [[Lyndall Ryan]], edited and introduced by [[Robert Manne]], professor of politics at [[La Trobe University]]. This anthology has itself been the subject of examination by [[Melbourne]] businessman, freelance writer and [[Objectivist movement|Objectivist]] John Dawson, in ''Washout: On the academic response to The Fabrication of Aboriginal History'', which argues that "Whitewash" leaves Windschuttle's claims and research unrefuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dawson |first=John |date=May 2004 |title=The Catches of Whitewash |url=http://quadrant.org.au/php/archive_details_list.php?article_id=777 |journal=Quadrant |volume=XLVIII |issue=5 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070908060311/https://www.quadrant.org.au/php/archive_details_list.php?article_id=777 |archivedate=8 September 2007 |pages= |doi= |access-date=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Contra Windschuttle",  an article published in the conservative publication ''[[Quadrant (magazine)|Quadrant]]'', S.G. Foster examined some of the evidence that Windschuttle presented on one issue, Stanner's notion of the "Great Australian Silence". In Foster’s opinion, the evidence produced by Windschuttle did not prove his case that the "Great Australian Silence" was largely a myth. Windschuttle argues that, in the years prior to Stanner’s 1968 Boyer lecture, Australian historians had not been silent on the Aboriginal people although, in most cases, the historians’ "discussions were not to Stanner’s taste" and the Aboriginal people "might not have been treated in the way Reynolds and his colleagues would have liked".&lt;ref&gt;Windschuttle, pp. 408, 409.&lt;/ref&gt; Foster argues that Windschuttle is "merciless with those who get their facts wrong" and that the fact that Windschuttle has also made a mistake&lt;ref&gt;Windschuttle wrote that a particular text was not used at the University of Sydney or the University of New South Wales when Foster states that it was: S.G. Foster, Contra Windschuttle&lt;/ref&gt; means that he did not meet the criteria that he used to assess 'orthodox historians' he was arguing against and whom he accused of deliberately and extensively misrepresenting, misquoting, exaggerating and fabricating evidence relating to the level and nature of violent conflict between Aboriginal people and white settlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Foster |first=S.

On 9 February 2008, however, it was announced that the second volume, anticipated to be published later in 2008, would be entitled ''The Fabrication of Australian History, Volume 2: The "Stolen Generations"'' and would address the issue of the removal of Aboriginal children (the "[[stolen generations]]") from their families in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Imre Salusinszky |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23183633-5013404,00.html |title=Imre Salusinszky, Aboriginal 'genocide' claim denied, '&amp;#39;The Australian'&amp;#39;, 9&amp;nbsp;February 2008 |publisher=Theaustralian.news.com.au |date=9 February 2008 |accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new volume was released in January 2010, now listed as ''Volume 3'', with a statement that Volumes 2 and 4 would appear later.&lt;ref name="grossly-inaccurate"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/national/rabbit-proof-fence-grossly-inaccurate-keith-windschuttle/story-e6frf7l6-1225809985321 |title=Rabbit-Proof Fence grossly inaccurate: Keith Windschuttle |website= |publisher=[[Herald Sun]] |accessdate=10 January 2010|date=2009-12-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Announcing the publication, Windschuttle claimed that the film ''[[Rabbit-Proof Fence (film)|Rabbit-Proof Fence]]'' had misrepresented the child removal at the centre of the story, and offered inaccurate accounts of Molly's journey as it was recounted by her daughter, Doris Pilkington. These claims were subsequently rejected by the makers of the film.&lt;ref name="film-makers-dispatch-historian"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/arts/film-makers-dispatch-historian-to-the-fence-over-distorted-history/story-e6frg8pf-1225810385666 |title=Filmmakers dispatch historian to the fence over distorted history |work=[[The Australian]] |accessdate=10 January 2010 |first=Jared |last=Owens |date=15 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stuart Macintyre's ''The History Wars''==
In 2003 Australian historian [[Stuart Macintyre]] published ''The History Wars'', written with Anna Clark.&lt;ref&gt;Macintyre S, Clark A. ''The History Wars''.  Melbourne: Melbourne University Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-522-85091-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was a study of the background of, and arguments surrounding, recent developments in Australian historiography, and concluded that the History Wars had done damage to the nature of objective [[Australian history]]. At the launch of his book, historian [[Stuart Macintyre]] emphasised the political dimension of these arguments&lt;ref&gt;Who plays Stalin in our History Wars? ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 17 September 2003 [http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/09/16/1063625030438.html]&lt;/ref&gt; and said the Australian debate took its cue from the [[Enola Gay]] controversy in the United States.&lt;ref name="Lehigh"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.lib.lehigh.edu/trial/enola/ |title=History on Trial website-Enola Gay Controversy |publisher=Digital.lib.lehigh.edu |date= |accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was launched by former Prime Minister [[Paul Keating]], who took the opportunity to criticise conservative views of Australian history, and those who hold them (such as the then Prime Minister [[John Howard]]), saying that they suffered from "a failure of imagination", and said that ''The History Wars'' "rolls out the canvas of this debate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/09/05/1062549021882.html |title=Keating's 'History Wars' - OpinionWebDiaryArchive2003 |publisher=www.smh.com.au |date= 5 September 2003|accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macintyre's critics, such as Greg Melluish (History Lecturer at the [[University of Wollongong]]), responded to the book by declaring that Macintyre was a partisan history warrior himself, and that "its primary arguments are derived from the pro-Communist polemics of the [[Cold War]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cis.org.au/Policy/summer03-04/polsumm0304-7.htm |title=Policy |publisher=Cis.org.au |date= |accessdate=27 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091013130222/http://www.cis.org.au/Policy/summer03-04/polsumm0304-7.htm |archivedate=13 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Keith Windschuttle said that Macintyre attempted to "caricature the history debate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2003/s938399.htm |title=Lateline - 03/09/2003: Authors in history debate . Australian Broadcasting Corp |publisher=Abc.net.au |date= |accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a foreword to the book, former [[Chief Justice of Australia]] Sir [[Anthony Mason (judge)|Anthony Mason]] said that the book was "a fascinating study of the recent endeavours to rewrite or reinterpret the history of European settlement in Australia."&lt;ref&gt;Macintyre, Stuart &amp; Clark, Anna, p. ??&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Museum of Australia controversy==
In 2001, writing in ''[[Quadrant (magazine)|Quadrant]]'', a [[Conservatism|conservative]] magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quadrant.org.au/about-us/| title=About Us|accessdate=3 February 2016|work = Quadrant}}&lt;/ref&gt;  historian [[Keith Windschuttle]] argued that the then-new [[National Museum of Australia]] (NMA) was marred by "[[political correctness]]" and did not present a balanced view of the nation's history.&lt;ref&gt;How not to run a museum: People's history at the postmodern museum. reproduced at {{cite web|url=http://www.sydneyline.com/National%20Museum.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820050424/http://www.sydneyline.com/National%20Museum.htm |archivedate=20 August 2006 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 the [[Howard Government]] commissioned a review of the NMA. A potentially controversial issue was in assessing how well the NMA met the criterion that displays should: "Cover darker historical episodes, and with a gravity that opens the possibility of collective self-accounting. The role here is in helping the nation to examine fully its own past, and the dynamic of its history—with truthfulness, sobriety and balance. This extends into covering present-day controversial issues."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nma.gov.au/shared/libraries/attachments/review/review_report_20030715/files/552/ReviewReport20030715.pdf |title=dcit10442_text |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=27 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328123706/http://www.nma.gov.au/shared/libraries/attachments/review/review_report_20030715/files/552/ReviewReport20030715.pdf |archivedate=28 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the report concluded that there was no systemic bias, it recommended that there be more recognition in the exhibits of European achievements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nma.gov.au/about_us/ips/review-of-exhibitions-and-public-programs |title=Review of Exhibitions and Public Programs, 2003 |publisher=National Museum of Australia |date= |accessdate=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The report drew the ire of some historians in Australia, who claimed that it was a deliberate attempt on the part of the Government to politicise the museum and move it more towards a position which [[Geoffrey Blainey]] called the 'three cheers' view of [[History of Australia|Australian history]], rather than the '[[#Black armband debate|black armband]]' view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2003/s902872.htm |title=Lateline - 15/07/2003: Museum review attracts historians ire . Australian Broadcasting Corp |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=15 July 2003 |accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2006 columnist [[Miranda Devine]] described some of the [[Braille]] messages encoded on the external structure of the NMA, including "sorry" and "forgive us our genocide" and how they had been covered over by aluminium discs in 2001, and stated that under the new Director "what he calls the 'black T-shirt' view of [[Culture of Australia|Australian culture]]" is being replaced by "systematically reworking the collections, with attention to 'scrupulous historical accuracy'".&lt;ref name="DevineApr06"&gt;{{cite news | last = Devine | first = Miranda | authorlink = Miranda Devine  | url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/miranda-devine/the-embedded-messages-that-adorn-museum/2006/04/01/1143441377890.html | title = Opinion: Disclosed at last, the embedded messages that adorn museum | work = [[Sydney Morning Herald]] | accessdate =11 June 2006 | date=2 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the current approach at the NMA is the Bells Falls Gorge Interactive display, which presents Windschuttles's view of an alleged massacre alongside other views and contemporary documents and displays of weapons relating to [[Australian frontier wars#New South Wales|colonial conflict around Bathurst in 1824]] and invites visitors to make up their own minds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nma.gov.au/education-kids/classroom_learning/multimedia/interactives/bells_falls_gorge |title=Bells Falls Gorge interactive display |publisher=National Museum of Australia |date=2012-05-22 |accessdate=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==University of New South Wales controversy==
Publication in 2016 of "Indigenous Terminology" guidelines&lt;ref&gt;"Indigenous Terminology" University of New South Wales ; https://teaching.unsw.edu.au/indigenous-terminology
&lt;/ref&gt; for the teaching and writing of history by the [[University of New South Wales]] created a brief media uproar.&lt;ref&gt;''Invasion of the history rewriters'', Daily Telegraph 30 March 2016; http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/invasion-of-the-history-rewriters/news-story/d18774ad2553314898261298cef4e17d&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst the advised language changes, they recommended "settlement" be replaced by "invasion", "colonisation" or "occupation". They also deemed that the generally accepted anthropological assumption&lt;ref&gt;Ried, James ''‘Invaded’ not settled: UNSW rewrites history'' The New Daily 30 March 2016; http://thenewdaily.com.au/news/2016/03/30/invaded-settled-unsw-rewrite-australian-history/&lt;/ref&gt; that "Aboriginal people have lived in Australia for 40,000 years" should be dropped for "... since the beginning of the Dreaming/s" as it "reflects the beliefs of many Indigenous Australians that they have always been in Australia, from the beginning of time" and because "many Indigenous Australians see this sort of measurement and quantifying as inappropriate." While some commentators considered the guidelines appropriate,&lt;ref&gt;Daley, Paul ''It's not 'politically correct' to say Australia was invaded, it's history'', The Guardian'' (Australia) 30 March 2016; https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/postcolonial-blog/2016/mar/30/its-not-politically-correct-to-say-australia-was-invaded-its-history&lt;/ref&gt; others categorised them as political correctness that was an anathema to learning and scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Chris ''Australian university accused of 'rewriting history' over British invasion language'', The Telegraph (London) 30 March 2016; https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/australiaandthepacific/australia/12207016/Australian-university-accused-of-rewriting-history-over-British-invasion-language.html&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==History wars and culture wars==
The "history wars" are widely viewed, by external observers and participants on both sides as similar to the "[[culture war]]" underway in the United States. William D. Rubinstein, writing for the conservative British think tank the [[Social Affairs Unit]], refers to the history wars as "the Culture War down under".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rubinstein |first=William D. |url=http://www.socialaffairsunit.org.uk/blog/archives/001055.php |title=Web Review: The Culture Wars Down Under: Keith Windschuttle, the Aboriginal people, and the Left - Part Two |publisher=The Social Affairs Unit |date=8 August 2006 |accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants in the debate including [[Keith Windschuttle]] and [[Robert Manne]] are frequently described as "culture warriors" for their respective points of view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/opinion/pms-contempt-for-abc/2006/06/16/1149964738584.html |title=PM's contempt for ABC - Opinion |publisher=theage.com.au |date=16 June 2006 |accessdate=27 April 2010 | location=Melbourne |first=Robert |last=Manne}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2006/06/15/1149964674485.html |title=ABC gets a culture warrior - National |publisher=theage.com.au |date=15 June 2006 |accessdate=27 April 2010 | location=Melbourne |first1=Michelle |last1=Grattan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12242">[[File:Ica stones3.JPG|thumb|right|300px|An Ica stone allegedly depicting dinosaurs.]]

The '''Ica stones''' are a collection of [[andesite]] stones found in [[Ica Province]], [[Peru]] that bear a variety of diagrams. Some of them supposedly have depictions of [[dinosaur]]s, and what is alleged to be advanced [[technology]]. These are recognised as modern curiosities or [[hoax]]es.

From the 1960s Javier Cabrera Darquea collected and popularized the stones, obtaining many of them from a farmer named Basilio Uschuya. Uschuya, after claiming them to be real ancient artifacts, admitted to creating the carvings he had sold and said he produced a [[patina]] by baking the stone in cow dung.

==Description==
The stones are composed of [[andesite]]. They vary in size from 3x2.5x1.5&amp;nbsp;cm to 40&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref name=Pezzia1968a/&gt; As a result of weathering, they have developed a thin [[patina]]. It consists of a [[weathering rind]] in which weathering has turned some of the [[feldspar]] into [[clay]], resulting in a softer material, rated 3 to 4 on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness]], which can be scratched.&lt;ref name=Pezzia1968a/&gt;

They are shallowly [[engraving|engraved]] with a variety of images, some directly incised, others by removing the background, leaving the image in [[relief]].

==Background==
Archaeological remains show evidence of Peruvian cultures going back for several thousand years. At some later stages, the whole of modern Peru was united into a single political and cultural unit, culminating in the [[Inca Empire]], followed by the [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire|Spanish conquest]]. At other stages, areas such as the [[Ica Valley]], a habitable region separated from others by desert, developed a distinctive culture of its own.&lt;ref name=Lanning&gt;{{cite book|title = Peru before the Incas| first=Edward P.| last=Lanning| publisher=Prentice-Hall| year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Excavations in [[Ica Province]] were carried out in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries by scholars such as [[Max Uhle]], [[Julio C. Tello]], [[Alfred L. Kroeber]], [[William Duncan Strong]] and [[John Howland Rowe]]. None of them reported the discovery of carved andesite stones. Nevertheless, carved stones which had been looted by ''huaqueros'', grave robbers, began to be offered for sale to tourists and amateur collectors.&lt;ref name=Pezzia1968a&gt;Pezzia Assereto, A (1968)  Ica y el Perú Precolombino. Tomo I. Arqueología de la provincia de Ica. Empresa Editora Liberia, Ojeda, Venezuela. 295 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of these collectors was Santiago Agurto Calvo, an architect by profession, who was [[Rector (academia)|Rector]] of the [[National University of Engineering]] in [[Lima]]. He organised searches in ancient cemeteries, and in August 1966 found such a stone in the Toma Luz sector, Callango district, in [[Ica Valley]]. The context corresponded to the [[Tiwanaku]] culture. He reported his discovery to the Regional Museum in [[Ica city]], and was accompanied on further expeditions by its curator, the  archaeologist Alejandro Pezzia Assereto.&lt;ref name=Pezzia1968a/&gt; In September 1966 in Uhle Hill cemetery, De la Banda sector, [[Ocucaje District]], they found, for the first time, an engraved stone with certain provenance in a tomb of the [[Paracas culture]]. This stone was a fairly flat and irregular in shape, approximately 7 x 6 x 2&amp;nbsp;cm in size. On it was carved a design which might be abstract, or could be taken as a flower with eight petals.&lt;ref name=Pezzia1968a/&gt; Agurto published the discovery in a Lima newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;Santiago Agurto Calvo. "Las Piedras Magicas de Ocucaje". ''El Comercio''. Lima, 11 December 1966&lt;/ref&gt;

Pezzia continued to search. In the ''San Evaristo'' cemetery in Toma Luz, he found a carved stone of similar size to the previous one, with a realistic image of a fish. The context dated the tomb to the [[Middle Horizon]] (600-1000 A.D.). In a grave not far away in the same cemetery, he found a stone with the fairly realistic design of a [[llama]], in a context typical of the Ica culture. In 1968, Pezzia published his findings, including drawings and descriptions.&lt;ref name=Pezzia1968a/&gt;

==Popularization by Cabrera==
[[File:Ica stones1.JPG|thumb|right|250px|A collection of Ica stones surrounding a portrait of Javier Cabrera]]

Meanwhile, in 1966, Peruvian physician Javier Cabrera Darquea was presented with a stone that had a carved picture of a fish, which Cabrera believed to be of an extinct species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Message of the Stones |last= Cabrera |first= Javier |location= Ica, Peru |url= http://members.cox.net/icastones/02a-book-chapter-1.htm |accessdate= 10 May 2012 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20111202175320/http://members.cox.net/icastones/02a-book-chapter-1.htm |archivedate= 2 December 2011 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cabrera's father had begun a collection of similar stones in the 1930s, and based on his interest in Peruvian prehistory, Cabrera began collecting more.  He initially purchased more than 300 from two brothers, Carlos and Pablo Soldi, who also collected pre-[[Inca Empire|Incan]] artifacts, who claimed they had unsuccessfully attempted to interest [[Archaeology|archaeologists]] in them.  Cabrera later found another source of the stones, a farmer named Basilio Uschuya, who sold him thousands more.  Cabrera's collection burgeoned, reaching more than 11,000 stones in the 1970s.&lt;ref name = Fortean/&gt; Cabrera published a book, ''The Message of the Engraved Stones of Ica'' on the subject, discussing his theories of the origins and meaning of the stones. In this he argued that the stones show "that man is at least 405 million years old" and for what he calls ''gliptolithic'' man, humans from another planet, and that "Through the transplantation of cognitive codes to highly intelligent primates, the men from outer space created new men on earth." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cabrera|first=Javier|title=The message of the engraved stones of Ica|year=2000|url=http://openlibrary.org/books/OL16716029M/The_message_of_the_engraved_stones_of_Ica}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Ica stones achieved greater popular interest when Cabrera abandoned his medical career and opened a museum to feature several thousand of the stones in 1996.&lt;ref name = Skepdic/&gt;

In 1973, during an interview with [[Erich von Däniken]], Uschuya stated he had faked the stones that he had sold.&lt;ref name = Fortean/&gt;  In 1975 Uschuya and another farmer named Irma Gutierrez de Aparcana confirmed that they had forged the stones they gave to Cabrera by copying the images from comic books, text books and magazines.&lt;ref name = Skepdic/&gt;  Later, Uschuya recanted the forging story during an interview with a German journalist, saying that he had claimed they were a hoax to avoid imprisonment for selling [[Artifact (archaeology)|archaeological artifacts]]. In 1977, during the [[BBC]] documentary ''Pathway to the Gods'', Uschuya produced an Ica stone with a dentist's drill and claimed to have produced a fake patina by baking the stone in cow dung.&lt;ref name = Fortean/&gt;  That same year, another BBC documentary was released with a skeptical analysis of Cabrera's stones, and the new-found attention to the phenomenon prompted Peruvian authorities to arrest Uschuya, as Peruvian law prohibits the sale of archaeological discoveries. Uschuya recanted his claim that he had found them and instead admitted they were [[hoax]]es, saying "Making these stones is easier than farming the land." He engraved the stones using images in books and magazines as examples and knives, chisels and a dental drill.&lt;ref name=" Feder 2010a"&gt;[[Kenneth L. Feder]], ''Encyclopedia of Dubious Archaeology: From Atlantis To The Walam Olum'', pages 143 (Greenwood, 2010). {{ISBN|978-0-313-37919-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said that he had not made all the stones. He was not punished, and continued to sell similar stones to tourists as trinkets.&lt;ref name = Fortean/&gt;  The stones continued to be made and carved by other artists as forgeries of the original forgeries.&lt;ref name = Skepdic/&gt;

==Impact==
Except in the rare cases that [[provenance]] is known, there is no reliable way of dating the stones.&lt;ref name = Fortean/&gt; Thus, a stone of uncertain origin can never be used to establish a conclusion which would otherwise be considered unlikely. The stones have been used by some [[Creationism|creationists]] to claim that humans lived in proximity with dinosaurs, which contradicts evidence that the [[extinction of dinosaurs]] predates mankind by approximately 66 million years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What really happened when the dino killer asteroid struck?|url=http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20160415-what-really-happened-when-the-dino-killer-asteroid-struck|website=BBC.com|publisher=BBC|accessdate=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least one official creationist source has rejected their use as an argument for creationism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ica Stones Bad Arguments|url=https://creation.com/ica-stones-bad-arguments|website=creation.com|publisher=Creation Ministries International|accessdate=3 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Believers in [[ancient astronauts]] have also attempted to use the stones as evidence of a lost, advanced civilization brought to man from other planets&lt;ref name = Fortean/&gt; and mytho-historians have claimed them as evidence that ancient myths are accurate histories, neither of which is a position supported in the scientific or academic communities.&lt;ref name = Skepdic/&gt;

In his ''Encyclopedia of Dubious Archaeology: From Atlantis To The [[Walam Olum]]'', archaeologist [[Ken Feder]] commented "The Ica Stones are not the most sophisticated of the archaeological hoaxes discussed in this book, but they certainly rank up there as the most preposterous."&lt;ref name=" Feder 2010a"/&gt;

'''Joan Kent Dillon''' (30 April 1925 – 18 January 2009) was a teacher, a nationally known [[historic preservation]] activist and an author.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Joan Kent was born 30 April 1925 in Lafayette, Indiana, to Gladys and Richard Kent of Tuxedo Park, New York.&lt;ref name="GlobeObit"&gt;{{cite news |last=Negri |first=Gloria |date=16 March 2009 |title=Joan Kent Dillon, at 83; Was Theater Preservation Activist |url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/obituaries/articles/2009/03/16/joan_kent_dillon_at_83_was_theater_preservation_activist/ |newspaper=Boston Globe |location=Boston, Mass. |publisher=Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC |accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CCTObit"&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Obituaries: Joan Kent Dillon, 83 |url=http://www.capecodonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090129/OBITS02/901290337 |newspaper=Cape Cod Times |location=Hyannis, Mass. |publisher=Local Media Group, Inc. |date=29 January 2009 |accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She grew up in St. Louis, Missouri, spending summers at the family's summer home in Whalewalk Farm, [[Orleans, Massachusetts]]. She attended [[Wheeler School]] in Providence, Rhode Island but graduated from [[Mary Institute and St. Louis Country Day School|Mary Institute]] in St. Louis in 1943.  Dillon earned a Bachelor of Arts from [[Smith College]] in 1947. Her husband-to-be, George Chaffee Dillon of Liberty, Missouri, had served in the Navy during the Second World War, rising to the rank of Lt. Commander, then receiving an MBA from Harvard Business School. They met in Cambridge and married on 11 September 1948. That same year the couple moved to Kansas City, Missouri where George went to work first for J. Bruening &amp; Co. then Butler Manufacturing in 1949, eventually becoming president and chairman of the board.&lt;ref name="GeorgeObit"&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Obituary: George C. Dillon |url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/wickedlocal-orleans/obituary.aspx?pid=163242974 |newspaper=Cape Codder |location=Orleans, Mass. |publisher=Gatehouse Media, Inc. |date=23 February 2013 |accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dillons had two daughters and a son. Joan Dillon went on to complete a Masters Degree in Medieval History at the [[University of Missouri]] in 1969 with a thesis on Medieval architecture.&lt;ref name="GlobeObit" /&gt; From 1962 to 1971 she taught Ancient and Medieval History at Sunset Hill School (now [[The Pembroke Hill School]]).

===The Folly Theater===
[[File:Folly Theater burlesk.jpg|thumb|280p|right|The [[Folly Theater]] in 1973 as a burlesque house, 300 W. 12th St., Kansas City, Missouri, as documented by the [[Heritage Documentation Programs|Historic American Buildings Survey]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://loc.gov/pictures/item/mo0438/ |title=Standard Theatre, 300 West Twelfth Street, Kansas City, Jackson County, MO |date= |series=Historic American Buildings Survey |publisher=Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division, Washington, D.C. |accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[Folly Theater]] is a historic theater in Kansas City, Missouri. It originally opened as the Standard Theater on 23 September 1900 and featured on the burlesque and vaudeville circuit.  Business started declining in 1928 and the theater was closed between 1932 and 1941. The theater began showing adult movies in 1969 but continued to physically decline. The balcony had been closed by the fire marshall in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021028192142/http://www.follytheater.com/history_restoration.html |archive-date= 28 October 2002 |url=http://www.follytheater.org/history_restoration.html |deadurl=yes |title=Folly Theater History: Restoration / Renovation (1974-November 1981) |author= |website=Folly Theater |accessdate=22 August 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The theater again closed in January 1974.  The theater's then owners, Annbar Associates and Elk Realty of New York, announced that if a buyer could not be identified by the end of the year, the theater would be demolished to make way for a parking lot.&lt;ref name="APReprieve"&gt;{{cite news |last=Associated Press |date=February 15, 1975 |title=Historic Showhouse Gets Reprieve |newspaper=The Evening Standard |location=Uniontown, Penn. |publisher=Uniontown Newspapers, Inc. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of local historic preservation activists, including Dillon and [[William N. Deramus III]], formed the nonprofit Performing Arts Foundation, to raise the money to purchase and restore the theater. The theater was offered for sale for $950,000. The Performing Arts Foundation raised $350,000 in contributions and through negotiation convinced Annbar Associates to offer the remaining $600,000 of the purchase price as a donation.&lt;ref name="APReprieve" /&gt;

Folly Theater was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Jackson County, Missouri: Downtown Kansas City|National Register of Historic Places]] in 1974.

But preventing the building from being demolished was just the beginning. The building was in a considerable state of disrepair. Most of the windows were broken. A chandelier had fallen onto the balcony. Pornographic magazines rotted in closets. Nineteen tones of pigeon dung would be removed from the building. Between 1974 and 1987 Dillon and the Performing Arts Foundation raised $5 million for the restoration of the theater, including a $1 million grant from the Department of Housing and Urban Development.  The theater was reopened in 1981. A plaque was mounted on the stage recognizing Joan Dillon's work in saving the Folly Theater. A pair of plaster pigeons installed above the box office by architect Bob Berkebile are named Joan and George after the Dillons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/1439 |title=Folly Theater |last1=Francis |first1=Donna |website=Cinema Treasures |accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A national role===
Her work saving and restoring the Folly Theater made Dillon a nationally known historic preservation advocate. She became a board member of the [[The Broadway League|League of Historic American Theaters]] from 1978-1981 and 1992-1998, the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] from 1980-1990, President Reagan's [[President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities|Committee on the Arts and Humanities]] from 1982-1990 and the Smithsonian National Board from 1989-1995.&lt;ref name="StarObit"&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Obituary: Joan Dillon |newspaper=Kansas City Star |location=Hyannis, Mass. |publisher=Local Media Group, Inc. |date=28 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her board and committee work required frequent travel to Washington, D.C.

===''American Theaters''===
For a number of years Dillon had been thinking about a book documenting America's nineteenth century historic theaters.  Through her work on historic preservation, Dillon met architectural historian [[David Arthur Naylor (architectural historian)|David Naylor]]. Naylor had already produced two books on movie theaters, ''American Picture Palaces: The Architecture of Fantasy'' (1981) and ''Great American Movie Theaters'' (1987),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sah.org/about-sah/sah-news/2013/03/01/obituary-david-naylor |title=Obituary: David Naylor |last1=Maddex |first1=Diane |date=1 March 2013 |website=Society of Architectural Historians |accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and during the years 1994-1996 the two worked together on Dillon's idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hdl.handle.net/1903.1/1344 |title=Joan Dillon papers, |last1=Curtis |first1=Peter |last2=Archer |first2=Joanne |date=October 2003 |publisher=University of Maryland Libraries |accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They began by contacting one thousand five hundred theaters by telephone and postcard. They then sent a follow-up questionnaire to more than a thousand from the first list. The two then traveled extensively with one or both Dillon and Naylor eventual visiting two hundred and fifty theaters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dillon |first=Joan |last2=Naylor |first2=David |date=1997 |title=American Theaters: Performance Halls of the Nineteenth Century |location=New York |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |isbn=0-471-14393-6 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the two arrived upon a list of forty theaters, arranged into seven broad categories, they deemed representative of the breadth of American nineteenth century theaters (see [[Joan Dillon (historic preservation activist)#American Theaters 2|next section]] for detail on their list and categories). The record of their survey, ''American Theaters: Performance Halls of the Nineteenth Century'', was published in 1997.

===Later life===
Throughout her life Dillon continued to spend summers in Cape Cod. In 1976 she bought a home in North Chatham, Massachusetts. Dillon continued her historic preservation activities in the Cape Cod region. She worked in Acquisitions for the [[Cape Cod Museum of Art]] from 2007-2009.&lt;ref name="StarObit" /&gt; In 2007 she published ''Barns of Cape Cod'' with her son, Kent C. Dillon and photographer Blandon Belushin.&lt;ref name="barns"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dillon |first=Joan |last2=Dillon |first2=Kent C. |last3=Belushin |first3=Blandon |date=2007 |title=Barns of Cape Cod |location=Atglen, Penn. |publisher=Schiffer Publishing, Ltd. |isbn=9780764325649}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the last ten years of her life she lived in Cape Cod permanently&lt;ref name="CCTObit" /&gt; and it was in her home there that Joan Dillon died at the age of 83 of leukemia and cardiac arrest on 18 January 2009.

==American Theaters==
After a brief historical essay, the bulk of the book consists of the section, "A Revue of Nineteenth Century American Theaters." From the thousands of initially identified theaters, the forty that Dillon and Naylor selected as exemplary of nineteenth century theaters are the following.

'''Josephine "Josie" Talamantez''' is a historian from [[San Diego]], [[California]]. She co-founded [[Chicano Park]] in 1970 and helped develop it into a cultural [[National Historic Landmark]] containing the largest collection of artistic murals in the United States. Talamantez was also the Chief of Programs for the [[California Arts Council]], served as the director of the [[Centro Cultural de la Raza]], and was on the board of the [[National Association of Latino Arts and Culture]].

== Creation and stewardship of Chicano Park ==
In 1970, the [[California Highway Patrol]] announced they were planning to build a substation below the Coronado bridge, replacing a potential park area that was there. Local residents, including Talamantez, responded by staging a 12-day occupation and successfully demanded that the space be allowed to remain a park. Talamantez, who was 18 years old and a student at [[San Diego City College]] at the time, helped found the Chicano Park Steering Committee to negotiate with officials on behalf of the park.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/politics/sd-me-chicano-historic-20170111-story.html|title=Chicano Park named National Historic Landmark|last=Warth|first=Gary|date=|work=San Diego Union-Tribune|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, Talamantez and others in the Steering Committee started discussing the addition of Mexican-American artwork to the park. Over the next 20 years, many pieces of artwork were added, including more than 70 murals by Chicano artists from across California, making the park the largest collection of murals in the United States. Other works of art in the park include [[Sculpture|sculptures]], [[Earthworks (art)|earthworks]], and an [[Architecture|architectural]] piece dedicated to the cultural heritage of the community.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/san-diego-activists-demand-city-owned-building-for-chicano-park-museum|title=San Diego Activists Demand City-Owned Building for Park Museum|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/arts/chicano-parks-history-could-fill-a-museum/|title=Chicano Park's History Could Fill a Museum – and Activists Think it Should - Voice of San Diego|date=2016-04-18|work=Voice of San Diego|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Landmark status ===

Talamantez and Manny Galaviz submitted the proposal that successfully added Chicano Park to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2013 due to its association with the [[Chicano Movement]]. 

In 1997, Talamantez began the process of placing Chicano Park with its artwork and murals on the National Register in order to prevent the city from damaging the murals while retrofitting [[San Diego–Coronado Bridge|Coronado Bridge]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Years later, Talamantez traveled to [[Washington, D.C.]] to make a case before a national review and advisory committee, and Chicano Park was successfully designated as a [[List of National Historic Landmarks in California|National Historic Landmark]] in December 2016.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Chicano-Park-Wins-US-Landmark-Status-as-Trump-Era-Looms-20170116-0014.html|title=Chicano Park Wins US Landmark Status as Trump Era Dawns|last=Gabriel|first=Elliott|access-date=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kpbs.org/news/2017/jan/16/landmark-status-chicano-park-boosters-renew-push-m/|title=With Landmark Status For Chicano Park, Boosters Renew Push For Museum|last=Lipkin|first=Maureen Cavanaugh, Michael|work=KPBS Public Media|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PriestleyHistoryLectures.jpg|right|thumb|Title page from [[Joseph Priestley]]'s ''Lectures'']]

'''''Lectures on History and General Policy''''' (1788) is the published version of a set of lectures on history and government given by the 18th-century British [[polymath]] [[Joseph Priestley]] to the students of [[Warrington Academy]].

The ''Lectures'' cover an array of topics—"forms of government, the feudal system, the rise of corporations, law, agriculture, commerce, the arts, finance and taxation, colonies, manners, population, war and peace"—demonstrating how all-encompassing Priestley believed the study of history to be.&lt;ref&gt;McLachlan, 255.&lt;/ref&gt; Priestley offers a version of history in which all events are "an exhibition of the ways of God;" studying history and nature, according to Priestley, "leads us to the knowledge of his perfections and of his will."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in McLachlan, 258.&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding history thus allows one to comprehend the natural laws God established and the perfection towards which they allow the world to tend. This [[Millennialism|millennial]] outlook is tied together with Priestley's belief in scientific progress and the improvement of the human race. Priestley maintained that each age improves upon the previous and studying history allows people to see and participate in that progress.&lt;ref&gt;Sheps, 138.&lt;/ref&gt; Priestley's millennial conception of history was in direct contrast to the two dominant historical paradigms of the time: [[Edward Gibbon]]'s decline narrative found in the ''[[Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' and [[David Hume]]'s cyclical narrative found in his ''[[History of England (Hume)|History of England]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sheps, 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosophical underpinning of Priestley's [[millennialism|millennial]] view of history was [[David Hartley (philosopher)|David Hartley's]] theory of association laid out in ''[[Observations on Man]]'' (1749). Hartley's [[Association of Ideas|associationism]], an expansion of [[John Locke]]'s theories in ''[[Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1690, postulated that the human mind operated according to natural laws and that the most important law for the formation of the self was "associationism." For Hartley, associationism was a physical process: vibrations in the physical world travelled through the nerves attached to people's sense organs and ended up in their brains. The brain connected the vibrations of whatever sensory input it was receiving with whatever feelings or ideas that the brain was simultaneously "thinking." These "associations" were impossible to avoid, formed as they were simply by experiencing the world; they were also the foundation of a person's character. Locke famously warns against letting "a foolish maid" convince a child that "goblins and sprites" are associated with the darkness, for "darkness shall ever afterwards bring with it those frightful ideas, and they shall be so joined, that he can no more bear the one than the other."&lt;ref&gt;Locke, John. ''An Essay Concerning Human Understanding''. Ed. [[Roger Woolhouse]]. New York: Penguin Books (1997), 357.&lt;/ref&gt; Associationism provided the scientific basis for Priestley's belief that man is "perfectible" and served as the foundation for all of his pedagogical innovations.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, 87; 93; Sheps, 137-9; 147-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Priestley viewed education as one of the primary forces shaping a person's character as well as the basis of morality, he, unusually for his time, promoted the education of women. Alluding to the language of Locke's ''Essay Concerning Human Understanding'', he wrote: "certainly, the minds of women are capable of the same improvement, and the same furniture, as those of men."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Watts, 89.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that if women were to care for children and be intellectually stimulating companions for their husbands, they had to be well-educated. Although Priestley advocated education for middle-class women, he did not extend this logic to the poor.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, 89–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Priestley also presented a method for historical research and was one of the first to argue for the primacy of original documents in the study of history. He contended that much could be learned from "material evidence" of former civilisations, such as "ancient coins, medals and inscriptions," as well as "exchequer rolls, public and private ledger books, letters, diaries, monetary, financial and exchange systems, systems of fortifications and city plans . . . [in addition to] ballads and works of fiction."&lt;ref&gt;Sheps, 141.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, 254-5; McLachlan, 256; Sheps, 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Lectures'' was well received and was employed by many educational institutions, such as the Dissenting academy at Hackney,&lt;!-- Is New College at Hackney the same as [[Homerton College, Cambridge]]? --&gt; [[Brown University|Brown]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Yale]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, 259; Sheps, 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the German army retreated during the later stages of the [[World War II|Second World War]], many of the urban areas of what is now Poland were severely damaged as a result of military action between the retreating forces of the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Wehrmacht]] and advancing ones of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]]. Other cities were deliberately destroyed by the German forces.  One of the most famous of these planned destructions was the razing of [[Warsaw]], the [[capital city|capital]] of Poland.&lt;ref name="anthonymtung"&gt;{{cite book | last = Anthony M. Tung| title = Preserving the world's great cities:The Destruction and Renewal of the Historic Metropolis|edition= 2001| publisher = [[Three Rivers Press]]| isbn= 0-517-70148-0|url=http://www.anthonymtung.com/excerpts.htm#Chap4}}&lt;/ref&gt; While extensively damaged by the failed [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] and [[Warsaw Uprising]], the city later underwent a [[Destruction of Warsaw|planned demolition]] by German forces under order from [[Adolf Hitler]] and high officials within the Nazi government. On 17 October 1944, [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] chief [[Heinrich Himmler]] famously stated, "The city must completely disappear from the surface of the earth and serve only as a transport station for the Wehrmacht."&lt;ref name= "Wituska, Tomaszewski p. xxii"&gt;[[#refWituskaTomaszewski2006|Wituska, Tomaszewski 2006]], p. xxii.&lt;/ref&gt;  Before they were stopped by the advancing Red Army, 85% of the city had been taken out.&lt;ref name= "Free Europe Committee p. 10"/&gt;  Warsaw was far from the worst off after the Nazi retreat; 97% of [[Jasło]]&lt;ref name="austriantimes"&gt;{{cite web |date= July 7, 2009|url = http://www.austriantimes.at/news/Panorama/2009-07-07/14509/Polish_town_at_odds_over_Hitler%92s_oak|title = Polish town at odds over Hitler's oak|format = |publisher = Austrian Times| accessdate = October 8, 2009 | last=Lisa Chapman |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 100% of [[Polanów]] were reduced to rubble.&lt;ref name="PL"/&gt;  Other towns such as [[Wałcz]] fared better, with only a quarter of the city being destroyed.&lt;ref name="PL"/&gt;  Ancient historical buildings in Polish cities were not spared; for example, [[Trzemeszno]]'s [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] [[basilica]] of 1130-45 was burnt down in 1945.&lt;ref name="PL"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="110346">{{caution|The term genocide is contentious and its academic definition varies. This list only considers mass killings recognized as genocides ''by the legal definition'' in significant scholarship and  criteria by the UN Genocide Convention}}
&lt;!--DO NOT add genocides that clearly do not meet the UN criteria, ie, killing of economic or political groups, or "cultural genocides/ethnocides." Provide sources that demonstrate the genocide is recognized as such by significant mainstream scholarship under the most common definition (the legal definition) of genocide. Remember wikipedia is not a [[WP:SOAPBOX]]. For highest and lowest estimates, do not use unreliable sources or sources which give significantly different figures than mainstream research. --&gt;

This '''list of genocides by death toll''' includes death toll estimates of all deaths that are either directly or indirectly caused by [[genocide]]. It does not include non strictly-genocidal mass killing (variously called [[mass murder]], [[crimes against humanity]], [[politicide]], [[policide]], [[classicide]], [[war crimes]]) such as the [[Thirty Years War]] (7.5 million deaths), [[Japanese war crimes]] (3 to 14 million deaths), the [[Red Terror]] (100,000 to 1.3 million deaths), the [[Atrocities in the Congo Free State]] (1 to 15 million deaths), the [[Great Purge]] (0.6 to 1.75 million death), or the [[Great Leap Forward]] (15 to 55 million deaths).

The United Nations Genocide Convention defines genocide as "acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF|url=https://www.un.org/ar/preventgenocide/adviser/pdf/osapg_analysis_framework.pdf|title=Analysis Framework: Legal definition of genocide|work=Office of the UN Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide (OSAPG)|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various other definitions can be found in scholarly literature and national law of different countries.

| [[The Holocaust]],{{refn|name=Wannsee|group=N|'''The Holocaust''', also referred to as the Shoah, was the systematic, bureaucratic, state-organized, persecution and murder of approximately 6 million Jews by the German [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] government and its collaborators. Initially it was carried out in German-occupied Eastern Europe by paramilitary death squads ([[Einsatzgruppen]]) by shooting or, less frequently, using ad hoc built [[Gas van|gassing vans]], and later in [[extermination camp]]s by gassing.{{r|HoloList}}&lt;br&gt;By extending its definition the Holocaust may also refer to the other victims of German war crimes during the rule of [[Nazism]], such as the [[Porajmos|Romani genocide]]'s victims, [[Nazi crimes against the Polish nation|Poles]] and other [[Slavs|Slavic civilian populations]] and [[German mistreatment of Soviet prisoners of war|POWs]], victims of [[Action T4|Germany's eugenics program]], political opponents, [[Persecution of homosexuals in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust|Homosexuals]], [[Persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses in Nazi Germany|Jehovah's Witnesses]], and civil hostages and [[Resistance during World War II|resisters]] from all over Europe.}} during [[World War II]]

As R.J. Rummel writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;"The human death toll over only 267 days was incredible. Just to give for five out of the eighteen districts some incomplete statistics published in Bangladesh newspapers or by an Inquiry Committee, the Pakistani army killed 100,000 Bengalis in Dacca, 150,000 in Khulna, 75,000 in Jessore, 95,000 in Comilla, and 100,000 in Chittagong. For eighteen districts the total is 1,247,000 killed. This was an incomplete toll, and to this day no one really knows the final toll. Some estimates of the democide [Rummel's 'death by government'] are much lower—one is of 300,000 dead—but most range from 1 million to 3 million. ... The Pakistani army and allied paramilitary groups killed about one out of every sixty-one people in Pakistan overall; one out of every twenty-five Bengalis, Hindus, and others in East Pakistan. If the rate of killing for all of Pakistan is annualized over the years the Yahya martial law regime was in power (March 1969 to December 1971), then this one regime was more lethal than that of the Soviet Union, China under the communists, or Japan under the military (even through World War II)."

Myanmar's military forces immediately launched a series of retaliatory attacks against Rohingya civilians, and were joined by local Buddhist extremists. Together they burnt down hundreds of Rohingya villages, killed thousands of Rohingya men, women, and children, tortured countless others, and sexually assaulted countless Rohingya women and girls. Several Rohingya refugees say they were forced to witness soldiers throwing their babies into burning houses to die in the fire. Numerous Rohingya refugee women and girls have provided accounts of being brutally gang raped.

&lt;!--&lt;ref name=holocaustestimates&gt;Early efforts by scholars to determine the number of Jews murdered by the Nazis were limited by a lack of access to pertinent records. The genocide seldom entered Western discourse, both due to ignorance and to the Cold-War politics which made West Germany a new ally of the United States.The first significant work on the subject published in English was [[Gerald Reitlinger]]'s ''Final Solution'' (1953), which, relying almost exclusively on German documentation, estimated 4.9 million dead. This figure is now considered extremely conservative. [[Raul Hilberg]]'s 1961 ''[[The Destruction of the European Jews]]'' became a classic in the field of Holocaust literature and made the genocide of the Jews known to the wider public, Hilberg estimated its victims to be 5.1 million lives, or 4.9 - 5.4 million broadly construed. The [[Adolf Eichmann#Trial|trial of Adolph Eichmann]] further raised awareness of the genocide, Eichmann also provided documentation and testimony which revised the number of the dead.The first work to arrive at a figure comparable to modern estimates was [[Lucy Dawidowicz]]'s ''[[The War Against the Jews]]'', published in 1975, the book provided detailed listings by country of the number of Jews killed in the Holocaust which are still used as a reference in modern Holocaust studies. Dawidowicz researched birth and death records in many cities of prewar Europe to come up with a death toll of 5,933,900 Jews. After the opening of Soviet records, scholarship arrived at a death toll of about 6 million Jews. Gutman and Rozett's [[Encyclopedia of the Holocaust]] was published in 1990 and estimated slightly over 5.9 million Jews were murdered.[[Wolfgang Benz]]'s ''The Holocaust: A German Historian Examines the Genocide'', published 1995, gave a toll of 6.2 million.&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

This is too close to the recorded figure of excess deaths, which is about 2.4&amp;nbsp;million. The latter figure must be substantially low, since many deaths were not recorded. Another demographic calculation, carried out on behalf of the authorities of independent Ukraine, provides the figure of 3.9&amp;nbsp;million dead. The truth is probably in between these numbers, where most of the estimates of respectable scholars can be found.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20661">'''Medieval studies''' is the academic interdisciplinary study of the [[Middle Ages]].

==Institutional development==
The term 'medieval studies' began to be adopted by academics in the opening decades of the twentieth century, initially in the titles of books like [[G. G. Coulton]]'s ''Ten Medieval Studies'' (1906), to emphasize a greater interdisciplinary approach to a historical subject. In American and European universities the term provided a coherent identity to centres composed of academics from a variety of disciplines including archaeology, art history, architecture, history, literature and linguistics. The Institute of Mediaeval Studies at St. Michael's College of the University of Toronto became the first centre of this type in 1929;&lt;ref&gt;H. Damico, J. B. Zavadil, D. Fennema, and K. Lenz, ''Medieval Scholarship: Philosophy and the arts: biographical studies on the formation of a discipline'' (Taylor &amp; Francis, 1995), p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; it is now the [[Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies]] (PIMS) and is part of the [[University of Toronto]]. It was soon followed by the Medieval Institute at the [[University of Notre Dame]] in Indiana, which was founded in 1946 but whose roots go back to the establishment of a Program of Medieval Studies in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;[http://medieval.nd.edu/about-us/our-history/ MI History], University of Notre Dame&lt;/ref&gt; As with many of the early programs at Roman Catholic institutions, it drew its strengths from the revival of medieval scholastic philosophy by such scholars as [[Étienne Gilson]] and [[Jacques Maritain]], both of whom made regular visits to the university in the 1930s and 1940s.

These institutions were preceded in the United Kingdom, in 1927, by the establishment of the idiosyncratic [[Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic, University of Cambridge|Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic]], at [[Cambridge University]]. Although Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic was limited geographically (to the [[British Isles]] and [[Scandinavia]]) and chronologically (mostly the [[early Middle Ages]]), it promoted the interdisciplinarity characteristic of Medieval Studies and many of its graduates were involved in the later development of Medieval Studies programmes elsewhere in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Lapidge, 'Introduction: The Study of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic in Cambridge, 1878-1999', in ''H. M. Chadwick and the Study of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic in Cambridge'', ed. by Michael Lapidge (Aberystwyth: Department of Welsh, Aberystwyth University, 2015), {{ISBN|9780955718298}}, pp. 1-58 [=''Cambrian Medieval Celtic Studies'', 69/70 (2015)].&lt;/ref&gt;

With university expansion in the late 1960s and early 1970s encouraging interdisciplinary cooperation, similar centres were established in England at [[University of Reading]] (1965), at [[University of Leeds]] (1967) and the [[University of York]] (1968), and in the United States at [[Fordham University]] (1971).&lt;ref&gt;G. McMullan and D. Matthews, ''Reading the medieval in early modern England'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007), p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent wave of foundations, perhaps helped by the rise of interest in things medieval associated with [[neo-medievalism]], include centres at [[King's College London]] (1988),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/ahri/centres/clams/about.aspx|title=King's College London -  About us|website=www.kcl.ac.uk|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[University of Bristol]] (1994), the [[University of Sydney]] (1997)&lt;ref&gt;D. Metzger and L. J. Workman, ''Medievalism and the academy II: cultural studies'' (Boydell &amp; Brewer, 2000), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bangor University]] (2005).&lt;ref&gt;G. McMullan and D. Matthews, ''Reading the medieval in early modern England'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007), p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval studies is buoyed by a number of annual international conferences which bring together thousands of professional medievalists, including the [[International Congress on Medieval Studies]], at [[Kalamazoo]] [[Michigan|MI]], [[United States|U.S.]], and the [[International Medieval Congress]] at the [[University of Leeds]].&lt;ref&gt;W. D. Padenm ''The Future of the Middle Ages: medieval literature in the 1990s'' (University Press of Florida, 1994), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of journals devoted to medieval studies, including: ''Mediaevalia'', ''Comitatus'', ''Viator'', ''Traditio'', ''[[Medieval worlds|Medieval Worlds]]'', ''Journal of Medieval History'', ''Journal of Medieval Military History'', and ''[[Speculum (journal)|Speculum]]'', an organ of the Medieval Academy of America founded in 1925 and based in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Molho, and G. S. Wood, ''Imagined histories: American historians interpret the past'' (Princeton University Press, 1998), p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; Another part of the infrastructure of the field is the [[International Medieval Bibliography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sawyer|first=Peter|title=The Origins of the ''International Medieval Bibliography'': Its Unwritten History (as told by its Founder)|journal=Bulletin of International Medieval Research|year=2009|volume=14 for 2008|pages=57–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Macartney|first=Hilary|title=La ''International Medieval Bibliography'' como herramienta de investigación para la historiografía de ciudades medievales y sus territorios|journal=La Ciudad medieval y su influencia territorial: Nájera.

==Historiographical development==
The term 'Middle Ages' first began to be common in English-language history-writing in the early nineteenth century. [[Henry Hallam]]'s 1818 ''View of the State of Europe during the Middle Ages'' has been seen as a key stage in the promotion of the term, along with [[John Ruskin|Ruskin]]'s 1853 ''Lectures on Architecture''.&lt;ref&gt;Robert I. Moore, 'A Global Middle Ages?', in &lt;i&gt;The Prospect of Global History&lt;/i&gt;, ed. by James Belich, John Darwin, Margret Frenz, and Chris Wickham (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016), pp. 80-92 (pp. 82-83).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"medieval, adj. and n.", "middle age, n. and adj." Accessed 5 August 2018. OED Online, Oxford University Press, June 2018, www.oed.com/view/Entry/115638; www.oed.com/view/Entry/118142. Accessed 5 August 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''medievalist'' was, correspondingly, coined by English-speakers in the mid-nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;"medievalist, n." OED Online, Oxford University Press, June 2018, www.oed.com/view/Entry/115640. Accessed 5 August 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

European study of the medieval past was characterised in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries by [[romantic nationalism]], as emergent [[nation-states]] sought to legitimise new political formations by claiming that they were rooted in the distant past.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Wood, 'Literary Composition and the Early Medieval Historian in the Nineteenth Century', in ''The Making of Medieval History'', ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), {{ISBN|9781903153703}}, pp. 37-53.&lt;/ref&gt; The most important example of this use of the Middle Ages was the nation-building that surrounded the [[unification of Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Bastian Schlüter, 'Barbarossa's Heirs: nation and Medieval History in Nineteenth-cand Twentieth-Century Germany', in ''The Making of Medieval History'', ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), {{ISBN|9781903153703}}, pp. 87-100.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bernhard Jussen, 'Between Ideology and Technology: Depicting Charlemagne in Modern Times', in ''The Making of Medieval History'', ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), {{ISBN|9781903153703}}, pp. 127-52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christian Lübke, 'Germany's Growth to the East: From the Polabian Marches to Germania Slavica', in ''The Making of Medieval History'', ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), {{ISBN|9781903153703}}, pp. 167-83.&lt;/ref&gt; Narratives which presented European countries as becoming modern by building on, yet also developing beyond, their medieval heritage, were also important in legimitating European [[colonialism]] elsewhere in the world, by suggesting that colonised regions had ''not'' developed in this way. The most prominent example of this aspect of medieval studies is imperial Britain and its former colonies in the Americas. Both nationalist and colonialist entanglements meant that the study of the Middle Ages in this period had a role in the emergence of [[white supremacism]].&lt;ref&gt;Allen J. Frantzen, &lt;i&gt;Desire for Origins: New Language, Old English, and Teaching the Tradition&lt;/i&gt; (New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John M. Ganim, &lt;i&gt;Medievalism and Orientalism: Three Essays on Literature, Architecture and Cultural Identity&lt;/i&gt; (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the early twentieth century also saw new approaches associated with the rise of [[social sciences]] such as [[economic history]] and [[anthropology]], epitomised by the influential [[Annales School]]. In place of what the Annalistes called ''[[histoire événementielle]]'', this work favoured study of large questions over [[longue durée|long periods]].&lt;ref&gt;Graham A. Loud and Martial Staub, 'Some Thoughts on the Making of the Middle Ages', in ''The Making of Medieval History'', ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), {{ISBN|9781903153703}}, pp. 1-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the [[Second World War]], the complicity of medievalism in Europe's competitive nationalism led to greatly diminished enthusiasm for medieval studies within the academy—though nationalist deployments of the Middle Ages still existed and remained powerful.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Geary, 'European Ethnicities and European as an Ethnicity: Does Europe Have too Much History?', in ''The Making of Medieval History'', ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), {{ISBN|9781903153703}}, pp. 57-69.&lt;/ref&gt; The proportion of medievalists in history and language departments fell,&lt;ref&gt;Robert I. Moore, 'A Global Middle Ages?', in &lt;i&gt;The Prospect of Global History&lt;/i&gt;, ed. by James Belich, John Darwin, Margret Frenz, and Chris Wickham (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016), pp. 80-92 (pp. 83-84).&lt;/ref&gt; encouraging staff to collaborate across different departments; state funding of and university support for archaeology expanded, bringing new evidence but also new methods, disciplinary perspectives, and research questions forward; and the appeal of interdisciplinarity grew. Accordingly, medieval studies turned increasingly away from producing national histories, towards more complex mosaics of regional approaches that worked towards a European scope, partly correlating with post-War [[Europeanisation]].&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Geary, 'European Ethnicities and European as an Ethnicity: Does Europe Have too Much History?', in ''The Making of Medieval History'', ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), {{ISBN|9781903153703}}, pp. 57-69.&lt;/ref&gt; An example from the apogee of this process was the large [[European Science Foundation]] project [[The Transformation of the Roman World]] that ran from 1993-98.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Wood, 'Report: The European Science Foundation's Programme on the Transformation of the Roman World and the Emergence of Early Medieval Europe', ''Early Medieval Europe'', 6 (1997), 217-28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jinty Nelson, 'Why Reinventing Medieval History is a Good Idea', in ''The Making of Medieval History'', ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), {{ISBN|9781903153703}}, pp. 17-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Amidst this process, from the 1980s onwards Medieval Studies increasingly responded to intellectual agendas set by [[critical theory]] and [[cultural studies]], with [[empiricism]] and [[philology]] being challenged by or harnessed to topics like the [[history of the body]].&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Bynum, “Why All the Fuss about the Body? A Medievalist's Perspective”, ''Critical Inquiry'' 22/1, 1995, pp. 1-33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Graham A. Loud and Martial Staub, 'Some Thoughts on the Making of the Middle Ages', in ''The Making of Medieval History'', ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), {{ISBN|9781903153703}}, pp. 1-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the twenty-first century, [[globalisation]] led to arguments that post-war Europeanisation had drawn too tight a boundary around Medieval Studies, this time at the borders of Europe,&lt;ref&gt;Little, Lester K., 'Cypress Beams, Kufic Script, and Cut Stone: Rebuilding the Master Narrative of European History', &lt;i&gt;Speculum&lt;/i&gt;, 79 (2004), 909-28.&lt;/ref&gt; with Muslim Iberia&lt;ref&gt;Richard Hitchcock, 'Reflections on the Frontier in Early Medieval Iberia', in ''The Making of Medieval History'', ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), {{ISBN|9781903153703}}, pp. 155-66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hisham Aidi, '[https://www.academia.edu/2917059 The Interference of al-Andalus: Spain, Islam, and the West]', ''Social Text'', 24 (2006), 67-88; {{DOI|10.1215/01642472-24-2_87-67}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox Christian]] east&lt;ref&gt;Michael Borgolte, 'A Crisis of the Middle Ages? Deconstructing and Constructing European Identities in a Globalized World', in ''The Making of Medieval History'', ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), {{ISBN|9781903153703}}, pp. 70-84.&lt;/ref&gt; seen in western European historiography as having an ambivalent relevance to Medieval Studies. Thus a range of medievalists have begun working on writing global histories of the Middle Ages — while, however, navigating, the risk of imposing Eurocentric terminologies and agendas on the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;James Belich, John Darwin, and Chris Wickham, 'Introduction: The Prospect of Global History', in &lt;i&gt;The Prospect of Global History&lt;/i&gt;, ed. by James Belich, John Darwin, Margret Frenz, and Chris Wickham (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016), {{DOI|10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198732259.001.0001}}, pp. 3--22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Robert I., 'A Global Middle Ages?', in &lt;i&gt;The Prospect of Global History&lt;/i&gt;, ed. by James Belich, John Darwin, Margret Frenz, and Chris Wickham (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016), pp. 80-92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Francis, 'Global History from an Islamic Angle', in &lt;i&gt;The Prospect of Global History&lt;/i&gt;, ed. by James Belich, John Darwin, Margret Frenz, and Chris Wickham (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016), pp. 127--45.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2375">'''Metahistorical Romance''' is a term describing postmodern historical fiction, defined by Amy J. Elias in ''Sublime Desire: History and Post-1960s Fiction.'' Elias defines metahistorical romance as a form of historical fiction continuing the legacy of historical romance inaugurated by [[Sir Walter Scott]] but also having ties to contemporary postmodern historiography. In particular, in metahistorical romance, poststructuralist play invokes the "historical sublime" as defined in the work of [[Hayden White]]. Metahistorical romance--such as [[Thomas Pynchon]]'s novel ''[[Mason &amp; Dixon]]''--attempts to recuperate the sublime untouchability of the past, to reach History and know it, but paradoxically in the context of the political. As with the Kantian sublime, the postmodern historical sublime is not the grasp of the sublime object itself but a kind of ironic awareness of the inaccessibility of the sublime object. There is a yearning that resembles the yearning for mystical knowledge at the core of the search for the historical sublime, and thus the concept ties contemporary historical fiction to a literary history (that of the historical novel), a type of historiography (postmodern, post-''[[Annales School|Annales]]'' historiography), and a spiritual questing. Elias argues that the postmodern imagination confronts the historical sublime rather than represses it; confronts it as repetition and deferral; seeks sublime History but simultaneously has lost faith in the storytelling needed to do so; and consequently has ties to, but reverses the dominant of, the traditional Anglo-American historical novel. The term "metahistorical romance" also builds upon work by [[Linda Hutcheon]], whose term "[[historiographic metafiction]]" described the ironic stance of contemporary historical fiction.

{{History of Greece}}

'''Mycenaean Greece''' (or the '''Mycenaean civilization''') was the last phase of the [[Bronze Age]] in [[Ancient Greece]], spanning the period from approximately 1600–1100 BCE. It represents the first advanced civilization in mainland [[Greece]], with its palatial states, urban organization, works of art, and writing system.&lt;ref name=Fields-2004-10&gt;{{harvnb|Fields|2004|pp=10–11}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the centers of power that emerged, the most notable were those of [[Pylos]], [[Tiryns]], [[Midea (Argolid)|Midea]] in the [[Peloponnese]], [[Orchomenus (Boeotia)|Orchomenos]], [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], [[Athens]] in [[Central Greece]] and [[Iolcos]] in [[Thessaly]]. The most prominent site was [[Mycenae]], in [[Regions of ancient Greece#Argolis|the Argolid]], after which the culture of this era is named. Mycenaean and Mycenaean-influenced settlements also appeared in [[Epirus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hammond|1976|loc=p. 139: "Moreover, in this area a small tholos-tomb with Mycenaean pottery of III B style and a Mycenaean acropolis have been reported at Kiperi near Parga, and another Mycenaean acropolis lay above the Oracle of the Dead on the hill called Xylokastro."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tandy|2001|loc=p. xii (Fig. 1); p. 2: "The strongest evidence for Mycenaean presence in Epirus is found in the coastal zone of the lower Acheron River, which in antiquity emptied into a bay on the Ionian coast known from ancient sources as ''Glykys Limin'' (Figure 2-A)."}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Borza|1992|loc=p. 64: "The existence of a Late Bronze Age Mycenaean settlement in the Petra not only confirms its importance as a route from an early period, but also extends the limits of Mycenaean settlement to the Macedonian frontier."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://aegeobalkanprehistory.net/img_articles/thumbs/tmb_75.jpg Aegeo-Balkan Prehistory – Mycenaean Sites]&lt;/ref&gt; on islands in the [[Aegean Sea]], on the coast of [[Asia Minor]], the [[Levant]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Wijngaarden|2002|loc=Part II: The Levant, pp. 31–124}}; {{harvnb|Bietak|Czerny|2007|loc=Sigrid Deger-Jalkotzy, "Mycenaeans and Philistines in the Levant", pp. 501–629}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cyprus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Wijngaarden|2002|loc=Part III: Cyprus, pp. 125–202}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peruzzi|1980}}; {{harvnb|van Wijngaarden|2002|loc=Part IV: The Central Mediterranean, pp. 203–260}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mycenaean Greeks introduced several innovations in the fields of engineering, architecture and military infrastructure, while trade over vast areas of the [[Mediterranean]] was essential for the Mycenaean economy. Their [[syllabic script]], the [[Linear B]], offers the first written records of the [[Greek language]] and [[Mycenaean religion|their religion]] already included several deities that can also be found in the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympic Pantheon]]. Mycenaean Greece was dominated by a warrior elite society and consisted of a network of palace states that developed rigid hierarchical, political, social and economic systems. At the head of this society was the king, known as [[wanax]].

Mycenaean Greece perished with the [[Late Bronze Age collapse|collapse of Bronze Age culture]] in the eastern Mediterranean, to be followed by the so-called [[Greek Dark Ages]], a recordless transitional period leading to [[Archaic Greece]] where significant shifts occurred from palace-centralized to de-centralized forms of socio-economic organization (including the [[Iron Age|extensive use of iron]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morris|1996|loc="Greece: Dark Age Greece", pp. 253–256}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Various theories have been proposed for the end of this civilization, among them the [[Dorian invasion]] or activities connected to the "[[Sea Peoples]]". Additional theories such as natural disasters and climatic changes have been also suggested. The Mycenaean period became the historical setting of much ancient [[Greek literature]] and [[Greek mythology|mythology]], including the [[Epic cycle|Trojan Epic Cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;The extent to which Homer attempted to or succeeded in recreating a "Mycenaean" setting is examined in [[Moses I. Finley]] ''The World of Odysseus'', 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bronze Age in mainland Greece is generally termed as the "Helladic period" by modern archaeologists, after ''Hellas'', the Greek name for [[Greece]]. This period is divided into three subperiods: The Early Helladic (EH) period (c. 2900–2000 BC) was a time of prosperity with the use of metals and a growth in technology, economy and social organization. The Middle Helladic (MH) period (ca. 2000–1650 BC) faced a slower pace of development, as well as the evolution of [[megaron]]-type dwellings and [[cist]] grave burials.&lt;ref name=Fields-2004-10/&gt; Finally, the Late Helladic (LH) period (c. 1650–1050 BC) roughly coincides with Mycenaean Greece.&lt;ref name=Fields-2004-10/&gt;

The Late Helladic period is further divided into LHI and LHII, both of which coincide with the early period of Mycenaean Greece (c. 1650–1425 BC), and LHIII (c. 1425–1050 BC), the period of expansion, decline and collapse of the Mycenaean civilization.&lt;ref name=Fields-2004-10/&gt; The transition period from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age in Greece is known as Sub-Mycenaean (c. 1050–1000 BC).&lt;ref name=Fields-2004-10/&gt;

The [[decipherment]] of the Mycenaean [[Linear B]] script, a writing system adapted for the use of the Greek language of the Late Bronze Age,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chadwick|1976|p=617}}.&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated the continuity of Greek speech from the second millennium BC into the eighth century BC when a new script emerged. Moreover, it revealed that the bearers of Mycenaean culture were ethnically connected with the populations that resided in the Greek peninsula after the end of this cultural period.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Latacz|2004|pp=159, 165}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Various collective terms for the inhabitants of Mycenaean Greece were used by Homer in his 8th century BC epic, the ''[[Iliad]]'', in reference to the [[Trojan War]]. The latter was supposed to have happened in the late 13th{{snd}}early 12th century BC, when a coalition of small Greek states under the king of Mycenae, besieged the walled city of [[Troy]]. Homer used the [[ethnonym]]s Achaeans, Danaans and Argives, to refer to the besiegers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Latacz|2004|p=120}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These names appear to have passed down from the time they were in use to the time when Homer applied them as collective terms in his ''Iliad''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Latacz|2004|p=138}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There is an isolated reference to ''a-ka-wi-ja-de'' in the Linear B records in [[Knossos]], Crete dated to c. 1400 BC, which most probably refers to a Mycenaean (Achaean) state on the Greek mainland.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hajnal|Posch|2009|pp=1–2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Egyptian records mention a ''T(D)-n-j'' or ''Danaya'' (''Tanaju'') land for the first time in circa 1437 BC, during the reign of [[Pharaoh]] [[Thutmoses III]] (r. 1479–1425 BC). This land is geographically defined in an inscription from the reign of [[Amenhotep III]] (r. circa 1390–1352 BC), where a number of Danaya cities are mentioned, which cover the largest part of southern mainland Greece.&lt;ref name=Kelder4647&gt;{{harvnb|Kelder|2010|pp=46–47}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Among them, cities such as Mycenae, Nauplion and Thebes have been identified with certainty. Danaya has been equated with the ethnonym ''Danaoi'' ({{lang-el|Δαναοί}}), the name of the mythical dynasty that ruled in the region of Argos, also used as an ethnonym for the Greek people by Homer.&lt;ref name=Kelder4647/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelder|2010|pp=37–38}}; {{harvnb|Latacz|2004|p=159}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the official records of another Bronze Age empire, that of the [[Hittites]] in [[Anatolia]], various references from c. 1400 BC to 1220 BC mention a country named ''Ahhiyawa''.&lt;ref name=BeckmanBryceCline4/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Latacz|2004|p=123}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent scholarship, based on textual evidence, new interpretations of the Hittite inscriptions, as well as on recent surveys of archaeological evidence about Mycenaean-Anatolian contacts during this period, concludes that the term ''Ahhiyawa'' must have been used in reference to the Mycenaean world (land of the Achaeans), or at least to a part of it.&lt;ref name=Bryce58&gt;{{harvnb|Bryce|2005|p=58}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Latacz|2004|p=122}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This term may have also had broader connotations in some texts, possibly referring to all regions settled by Mycenaeans or regions under direct Mycenaean political control.&lt;ref name=BeckmanBryceCline4&gt;{{harvnb|Beckman|Bryce|Cline|2012|p=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another similar ethnonym ''Ekwesh'' in twelfth century BC Egyptian inscriptions, has been commonly identified with the Ahhiyawans. These Ekwesh were mentioned as a group of the [[Sea People]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bryce|2005|p=357}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Shaft grave era (c. 1600–1450 BC)===
[[File:MaskOfAgamemnon.jpg|thumb|Death mask, known as the [[Mask of Agamemnon]], Grave Circle A, Mycenae, 16th century BC, probably the most famous artifact of Mycenaean Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2010|p=92: "The most famous object from Shaft Grave V, if not all of Mycenaean Greece, is the gold mask popularly known as the "mask of Agamemnon"."}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Mycenaean civilization originated and evolved from the society and culture of the Early and Middle Helladic period in mainland Greece under influences from [[Minoan civilization|Minoan Crete]].&lt;ref name=Dickinson&gt;{{harvnb|Dickinson|1977|pp=32, 53, 107–108}}; {{harvnb|Dickinson|1999|pp=97–107}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of the Middle Bronze Age (c. 1600 BC) a significant increase in the population and the number of settlements occurred.&lt;ref name=Schofield31/&gt; A number of centers of power emerged in southern mainland Greece dominated by a warrior elite society,&lt;ref name=Fields-2004-10/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dickinson/&gt; while the typical dwellings of that era were an early type of [[megaron]] buildings. Some more complex structures are classified as forerunners of the later palaces. In a number of sites, defensive walls were also erected.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schofield|2006|p=51}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, new types of burials and more imposing ones have been unearthed, which display a great variety of luxurious objects.&lt;ref name=Schofield31/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schofield|2006|p=48}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the various burial types, the [[shaft grave]] became the most common form of elite burial, a feature that gave the name to the early period of Mycenaean Greece.&lt;ref name=Schofield31&gt;{{harvnb|Schofield|2006|p=31}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the Mycenaean elite, deceased men were usually laid to rest in gold masks and funerary armor, and women in gold crowns and clothes gleaming with gold ornaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schofield|2006|p=32}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The royal shaft graves next to the acropolis of Mycenae, in particular the Grave Circles [[Grave Circle A|A]] and [[Grave Circle B|B]] signified the elevation of a native Greek-speaking royal dynasty whose economic power depended on long-distance sea trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dickinson|1977|pp=53, 107}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, the Mycenaean centers witnessed increased contacts with the outside world and especially with the [[Cyclades]] and the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] centers in the island of [[Crete]].&lt;ref name=Fields-2004-10/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schofield31/&gt; Mycenaean presence appears to be also depicted in a fresco at [[Akrotiri (Santorini)|Akrotiri]], on [[Thera]] island, which possibly displays many warriors in [[Boar's tusk helmet]]s, a feature typical of Mycenaean warfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schofield|2006|p=67}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 15th century, commerce intensified with Mycenaean pottery reaching the western coast of [[Asia Minor]], including [[Miletus]] and [[Troy]], [[Cyprus]], [[Lebanon]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schofield|2006|pp=64–68}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the Shaft Grave era, a new and more imposing type of elite burial emerged, the [[Beehive tomb#Greece|Tholos]]: large circular burial chambers with high vaulted roofs and a straight entry passage lined with stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Castleden|2005|p=97}}; {{harvnb|Schofield|2006|p=55}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Koine era (c. 1450 BC–1250 BC)===
[[File:La Dame de Mycènes, fresco.jpg|thumb|Fresco depicting a female figure in the acropolis of Mycenae, 13th century BC]]
The [[Minoan eruption|eruption of Thera]], which according to archaeological data occurred in c. 1500 BC, resulted in the decline of the Minoan civilization of Crete.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chadwick|1976|p=12}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This turn of events gave the opportunity to the Mycenaeans to spread their influence throughout the Aegean. Around c. 1450 BC, they were in control of Crete itself, including [[Knossos]], and colonized several other Aegean islands, reaching as far as [[Rhodes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tartaron|2013|p=28}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schofield7172/&gt; Thus the Mycenaeans became the dominant power of the region, marking the beginning of the Mycenaean 'Koine' era (from {{lang-el|Κοινή}}, common), a highly uniform culture that spread in mainland Greece and the Aegean.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schofield|2006|p=75}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the early 14th century BC, Mycenaean trade began to take advantage of the new trading opportunities in the Mediterranean after the Minoan collapse.&lt;ref name=Schofield7172&gt;{{harvnb|Schofield|2006|pp=71–72}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The trade routes were expanded further, reaching [[Cyprus]], [[Amman]] in the Near East, [[Apulia]] in Italy and [[Spain]].&lt;ref name=Schofield7172/&gt; From that time period (c. 1400 BC), the palace of Knossos has yielded the earliest records of the Greek [[Linear B]] script, based on the previous [[Linear A]] of the Minoans. The use of the new script spread in mainland Greece and offers valuable insight into the administrative network of the palatial centers. However, the unearthed records are too fragmentary for a political reconstruction of Bronze Age Greece.&lt;ref name="Kelder8"/&gt;

[[File:Mycenaean armour 1400BC.jpg|thumb|left|Mycenaean [[Dendra panoply|panoply]], found in Dendra, Argolid, {{circa}} 1400 BC]]

Excavations at Miletus, southwest [[Asia Minor]], indicate the existence of a Mycenaean settlement there already from c. 1450 BC, replacing the previous Minoan installations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tartaron|2013|p=21}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This site became a sizable and prosperous Mycenaean center until the 12th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelder|2010|pp=50, 52}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the archaeological evidence, this is also attested in Hittite records, which indicate that Miletos (Milawata in Hittite) was the most important base for Mycenaean activity in Asia Minor.&lt;ref name="Bryce 2005 361"&gt;{{harvnb|Bryce|2005|p=361}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Mycenaean presence also reached the adjacent sites of [[Iasos|Iasus]] and [[Ephesus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Castleden|2005|loc=p. 194: "The Mycenaean colonies in Anatolia were emphatically confined to a narrow coastal strip in the west. There were community-colonies at Ephesus, Iasos and Miletus, but they had little effect on the interior..."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, imposing palaces were built in the main Mycenaean centers of the mainland. The earliest palace structures were megaron-type buildings, such as the Menelaion in [[Sparta]], [[Lakonia]].&lt;ref name="Kelder107"/&gt; Palaces proper are datable from c. 1400 BC, when [[Cyclopean masonry|Cyclopean fortifications]] were erected at Mycenae and nearby [[Tiryns]].&lt;ref name=Fields-2004-10/&gt; Additional palaces were built in [[Midea (Argolid)|Midea]] and [[Pylos]] in [[Peloponnese]], [[Athens]], [[Eleusis]], [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] and [[Orchomenus (Boeotia)|Orchomenos]] in [[Central Greece]] and [[Iolcos]], in [[Thessaly]], the latter being the northernmost Mycenaean center. Knossos in Crete also became a Mycenaean center, where the former Minoan complex underwent a number of adjustments, including the addition of a [[Throne Room, Knossos|throne room]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelder|2010|pp=108–109}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These centers were based on a rigid network of bureaucracy where administrative competencies were classified into various sections and offices according to specialization of work and trades. At the head of this society was the king, known as [[anax|wanax]] (Linear B: wa-na-ka) in Mycenaean Greek terms. All powers were vested in him, as the main landlord and spiritual and military leader. At the same time he was an entrepreneur and trader and was aided by a network of high officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelder|2010|p=11}}; {{harvnb|Fields|2004|p=53}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Involvement in Asia Minor====
The presence of Ahhiyawa in western Anatolia is mentioned in various Hittite accounts from c. 1400 to c. 1220 BC.&lt;ref name="Bryce 2005 361"/&gt; Ahhiyawa is generally accepted as a Hittite translation of Mycenaean Greece (Achaeans in Homeric Greek), but a precise geographical definition of the term cannot be drawn from the texts.&lt;ref name="BeckmanBryceCline6"/&gt; During this time, the kings of Ahhiyawa were evidently capable of dealing with their Hittite counterparts both on a diplomatic and military level.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelder|2010|pp=119–120}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Ahhiyawan activity was to interfere in Anatolian affairs, with the support of anti-Hittite uprisings or through local vassal rulers, which the Ahhiyawan king used as agents for the extension of his influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bryce|2005|p=59}}; {{harvnb|Kelder|2010|p=23}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:14 century BC Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East during the 14th century BC; Mycenaean Greece in purple]]

In c. 1400 BC, Hittite records mention the military activities of an Ahhiyawan warlord, [[Attarsiya]], a possible Hittite way of writing the Greek name [[Atreus]], who attacked Hittite vassals in western Anatolia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bryce|2005|pp=129, 368}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in c. 1315 BC, an anti-Hittite rebellion headed by [[Arzawa]], a Hittite vassal state, received support from Ahhiyawa.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bryce|2005|p=193}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Ahhiyawa appears to be in control of a number of islands in the Aegean, an impression also supported by archaeological evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelder|2010|p=26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During the reign of the Hittite king [[Hattusili III]] (c. 1267–1237 BC), the king of Ahhiyawa is recognized as a "Great King" and of equal status with the other contemporary great Bronze Age rulers: the kings of [[New Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]], [[Kassites|Babylonia]] and [[Middle Assyrian period#Middle Assyrian Empire 1392-1056 BC|Assyria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bryce|2005|p=58}}; {{harvnb|Kelder|2010|pp=119–120}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, another anti-Hittite movement, led by [[Piyama-Radu]], broke out and was supported by the king of Ahhiyawa.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bryce|2005|p=224}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Piyama-Radu caused major unrest in the region of [[Wilusa]] and later invaded the island of [[Lesbos]], which then passed into Ahhiyawan control.&lt;ref name=Kelder27&gt;{{harvnb|Kelder|2010|p=27}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hittite-Ahhiyawan confrontation in Wilusa, the Hittite name for [[Troy]], may provide the [[Historicity of the Iliad|historical foundation]] for the [[Trojan War]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bryce|2005|pp=361, 364}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this instability, the Hittite king initiated [[Tawagalawa letter|correspondence]] in order to convince his Ahhiyawan counterpart to restore peace in the region. The Hittite record mentions a certain Tawagalawa, a possible Hittite translation for Greek Eteocles, as brother of the king of Ahhiyawa.&lt;ref name=Kelder27/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bryce|2005|p=290}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collapse (c. 1250–1100 BC)===

====Initial decline and revival====
[[File:Marching soldiers observed by a female figure, in a krater of c. 1200 BC in Mycenae.jpg|thumb|left|Marching soldiers observed by a female figure, in a [[Warrior Vase|krater]] of c. 1200 BC in Mycenae]]
In {{circa}} 1250 BC, the first wave of destruction apparently occurred in various centers of mainland Greece for reasons that cannot be identified by archaeologists. In [[Boeotia]], [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] was burned to the ground, around that year or slightly later. Nearby [[Orchomenus (Boeotia)|Orchomenos]] shared the same fate, while the Boeotian fortifications of [[Gla]] were deserted.&lt;ref name="Kelder 2010 34"&gt;{{harvnb|Kelder|2010|p=34}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Peloponnese, a number of buildings surrounding the citadel of Mycenae were attacked and burned.&lt;ref name="Cline 2014 130"&gt;{{harvnb|Cline|2014|p=130}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

These incidents appear to have prompted the massive strengthening and expansion of the fortifications in various sites. In some cases, arrangements were also made for the creation of subterranean passages which led to underground cisterns. Tiryns, Midea and Athens expanded their defences with new cyclopean-style walls.&lt;ref name=Castleden219&gt;{{harvnb|Castleden|2005|p=219}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The extension program in Mycenae almost doubled the fortified area of the citadel. To this phase of extension belongs the impressive [[Lion Gate]], the main entrance into the Mycenaean acropolis.&lt;ref name=Castleden219/&gt;

It appears that after this first wave of destruction a short-lived revival of Mycenaean culture followed.&lt;ref name=Freeman126/&gt; Mycenaean Greece continues to be mentioned in international affairs, particularly in Hittite records. In c. 1220 BC, the king of Ahhiyawa is again reported to have been involved in an anti-Hittite uprising in western Anatolia.&lt;ref name=Kelder33&gt;{{harvnb|Kelder|2010|p=33}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another contemporary Hittite account reports that Ahhiyawan ships should avoid [[Middle Assyrian Empire|Assyrian]]-controlled harbors, as part of a trade embargo imposed on Assyria.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelder|2010|p=32}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, in the second half of 13th century BC, trade was in decline in the Eastern Mediterranean, most probably due to the unstable political environment there.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tartaron|2013|p=20}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Final collapse====
None of the defence measures appear to have prevented the final destruction and collapse of the Mycenaean states. A second destruction struck Mycenae in ca. 1190 BC or shortly thereafter. This event marked the end of Mycenae as a major power. The site was then reoccupied, but on a smaller scale.&lt;ref name="Cline 2014 130"/&gt; The palace of [[Pylos]], in the southwestern Peloponnese, was destroyed in c. 1180 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cline|2014|p=129}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tartaron18&gt;{{harvnb|Tartaron|2013|p=18}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Linear B archives found there, preserved by the heat of the fire that destroyed the palace, mention hasty defence preparations due to an imminent attack without giving any detail about the attacking force.&lt;ref name=Freeman126&gt;{{harvnb|Freeman|2014|p=126}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of this turmoil, specific regions in mainland Greece witnessed a dramatic population decrease, especially Boeotia, Argolis and [[Messenia]].&lt;ref name=Freeman126/&gt; Mycenaean refugees migrated to [[Cyprus]] and the [[Levant]]ine coast.&lt;ref name=Tartaron18/&gt; Nevertheless, other regions on the edge of the Mycenaean world prospered, such as the [[Ionian islands]], the northwestern Peloponnese, parts of [[Attica]] and a number of Aegean islands.&lt;ref name=Freeman126/&gt; The [[acropolis of Athens]], oddly, appears to have avoided destruction.&lt;ref name=Freeman126/&gt;

====Hypotheses for the collapse====
{{See also|Bronze Age collapse|Dorian Invasion}}
[[File:Invasions, destructions and possible population movements during the Bronze Age Collapse, ca. 1200 BC.png|thumb|Invasions, destructions and possible population movements during the collapse of the Bronze Age, ca. 1200 BC]]

The reasons for the end of the Mycenaean culture have been hotly debated among scholars. At present, there is no satisfactory explanation for the collapse of the Mycenaean palace systems. The two most common theories are population movement and internal conflict. The first attributes the destruction of Mycenaean sites to invaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mylonas|1966|pp=227–228}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The hypothesis of a [[Dorian invasion]], known as such in [[Ancient Greek Mythology|Ancient Greek tradition]], that led to the end of Mycenaean Greece, is supported by sporadic archaeological evidence such as new types of burials, in particular cist graves, and the use of a new dialect of Greek, the [[Doric Greek|Doric]] one. It appears that the Dorians moved southward gradually over a number of years and devastated the territory, until they managed to establish themselves in the Mycenaean centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mylonas|1966|pp=231–232}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A new type of ceramic also appeared, called "Barbarian Ware" because it was attributed to invaders from the north.&lt;ref name=Freeman126/&gt; On the other hand, the collapse of Mycenaean Greece coincides with the activity of the [[Sea Peoples]] in the Eastern Mediterranean. They caused widespread destruction in Anatolia and the Levant and were finally [[Battle of the Delta|defeated]] by Pharaoh [[Ramesses III]] in c. 1175 BC. One of the ethnic groups that comprised these people were the ''Eqwesh'', a name that appears to be linked with the Ahhiyawa of the Hittite inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Drews|1993|p=49}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternative scenarios propose that the fall of Mycenaean Greece was a result of internal disturbances which led to internecine warfare among the Mycenaean states or civil unrest in a number of states, as a result of the strict hierarchical social system and the ideology of the wanax.&lt;ref name=Tartaron19/&gt; In general, due to the obscure archaeological picture in 12th-11th century BC Greece, there is a continuing controversy among scholars over whether the impoverished societies that succeeded the Mycenaean palatial states were newcomers or populations that already resided in Mycenaean Greece. Recent archaeological findings tend to favor the latter scenario.&lt;ref name=Freeman126/&gt; Additional theories, concerning [[Bronze Age collapse#Nature and causes of destruction|natural factors]], such as climate change, droughts or earthquakes have also been proposed.&lt;ref name=Tartaron19&gt;{{harvnb|Tartaron|2013|p=19}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory considers the decline of the Mycenaean civilization as a manifestation of a common pattern for the decline of many ancient civilizations: the Minoan, the Harrapan and the Western Roman Empire. The reason for the decline is migration due to overpopulation.&lt;ref&gt;Andrey Alexakha A model of social progress. The journal of European economic history. (3) pp. 164-169.  http://www.jeeh.it/articolo?urn=urn:abi:abi:RIV.JOU:2016;3.137&amp;ev=1&lt;/ref&gt; The period following the end of Mycenaean Greece, c. 1100-800 BC, is generally termed the "[[Greek Dark Ages]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freeman|2014|p=127}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political organization==
[[File:Mycenaean Palace States.svg|thumb|upright=1.45|Reconstruction of the political landscape in c. 1400-1250 BC mainland southern Greece]]

===Palatial states===
Mycenaean palatial states, or centrally organized palace-operating polities, are recorded in ancient [[Greek literature]] and [[Greek mythology|mythology]] (e.g., ''Iliad'', [[Catalogue of Ships]]) and confirmed by discoveries made by modern archaeologists such as [[Heinrich Schliemann]]. Each Mycenaean kingdom was governed from the palace, which exercised control over most, if not all, industries within its realm. The palatial territory was divided into several sub-regions, each headed by its provincial center.&lt;ref name=Kelder9/&gt; Each province was further divided in smaller districts, the ''da-mo''.&lt;ref name=Kelder9/&gt; A number of palaces and fortifications appear to be part of a wider kingdom. For instance, [[Gla]], located in the region of Boeotia, belonged to the state of nearby Orchomenos.&lt;ref name="Kelder 2010 34"/&gt; Moreover, the palace of Mycenae appeared to have ruled over a territory two to three times the size of the other palatial states in Bronze Age Greece. Its territory would have also included adjacent centers, including [[Tiryns]] and [[Nafplio|Nauplion]], which could plausibly be ruled by a member of Mycenae's ruling dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelder|2010|p=97}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The unearthed Linear B texts are too fragmentary for the reconstruction of the political landscape in Mycenaean Greece and they do not support the existence of a larger Mycenaean state.&lt;ref name=BeckmanBryceCline6&gt;{{harvnb|Beckman|Bryce|Cline|2012|p=6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelder|2010|pp=8–9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, contemporary Hittite and Egyptian records suggest the presence of a single state under a "Great King".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelder|2010|pp=45, 86, 107}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, based on archaeological data, some sort of confederation among a number of palatial states appears to be possible.&lt;ref name=BeckmanBryceCline6/&gt; If some kind of united political entity existed, the dominant center was probably located in Thebes or in Mycenae, with the latter state being the most probable center of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelder|2010|pp=86–87}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Society and administration===

The Neolithic agrarian village (6000 BC) constituted the foundation of Bronze Age political culture in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|1995|p=350}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The vast majority of the preserved Linear B records deal with administrative issues and give the impression that Mycenaean palatial administration was highly uniform with the use of the same language, terminology, system of taxation and distribution.&lt;ref name=Kelder8&gt;{{harvnb|Kelder|2010|p=8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kelder9&gt;{{harvnb|Kelder|2010|p=9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Considering this sense of uniformity, the [[Pylos]] archive, which is the best preserved one in the Mycenaean world, is generally taken as a representative one.&lt;ref name=Kelder8/&gt;

The state was ruled by a king, the ''[[anax|wanax]]'' (ϝάναξ), whose role was religious and perhaps also military and judicial.&lt;ref name="Chadwick"&gt;{{harvnb|Chadwick|1976|loc=Chapter 5: Social Structure and Administrative System, pp. 69–83}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The wanax oversaw virtually all aspects of palatial life, from religious feasting and offerings to the distribution of goods, craftsmen and troops.&lt;ref name=Kelder11&gt;{{harvnb|Kelder|2010|p=11}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Under him was the ''lāwāgetas'' ("the leader of the people"), whose role appears mainly religious. His activities possibly overlap with the wanax and is usually seen as the second-in-command.&lt;ref name=Kelder11/&gt; Both wanax and lāwāgetas were at the head of a military aristocracy known as the ''eqeta'' ("companions" or "followers").&lt;ref name="Chadwick"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fields|2004|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; The land possessed by the wanax is usually the ''témenos'' (te-me-no). There is also at least one instance of a person, [[Enkhelyawon]], at Pylos, who appears titleless in the written record but whom modern scholars regard as probably a king.&lt;ref name=Chadwick71-72&gt;{{harvnb|Chadwick|1976}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=RMj7M_tGaNMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA71#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 71–72].&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of local officials positioned by the wanax appear to be in charge of the districts, such as ''ko-re-te'' (''koreter'', '"governor"), ''po-ro-ko-re-te'' (''prokoreter'', "deputy") and the ''da-mo-ko-ro'' (''damokoros'', "one who takes care of a damos"), the latter probably being appointed to take charge of the commune. A council of elders was chaired, the ''ke-ro-si-ja'' (cf. γερουσία, ''gerousía''). The ''basileus'', who in latter Greek society was the name of the king, refers to communal officials.&lt;ref name="Chadwick"/&gt;

In general, Mycenaean society appears to have been divided into two groups of free men: the king's entourage, who conducted administrative duties at the palace, and the people, ''[[wikt:δῆμος|da-mo]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|dh{{=}}mos|δῆμος|ref|mLSJ}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These last were watched over by royal agents and were obliged to perform duties for and pay taxes to the palace.&lt;ref name="Chadwick"/&gt; Among those who could be found in the palace were well-to-do high officials, who probably lived in the vast residences found in proximity to Mycenaean palaces, but also others, tied by their work to the palace and not necessarily better off than the members of the ''da-mo'', such as craftsmen, farmers, and perhaps merchants. Occupying a lower rung of the social ladder were the slaves, ''do-e-ro'', ([[cf.]] {{lang|grc|δοῦλος}}, ''doúlos'').&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|dou{{=}}los1|δοῦλος|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are recorded in the texts as working either for the palace or for specific deities.&lt;ref name="Chadwick"/&gt;

==Economy==

===Organization===
The Mycenaean economy, given its pre-monetary nature, was focused on the redistribution of goods, commodities and labor by a central administration. The preserved Linear B records in Pylos and Knossos indicate that the palaces were closely monitoring a variety of industries and commodities, the organization of land management and the rations given to the dependent personnel.&lt;ref name=Olsen7&gt;{{harvnb|Olsen|2014|p=7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cline145/&gt; The Mycenaean palaces maintained extensive control of the nondomestic areas of production through careful control and acquisition and distribution in the palace industries, and the tallying of produced goods.&lt;ref name=Cline242&gt;{{harvnb|Cline|2012|p=242}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Budin94&gt;{{harvnb|Budin|2009|p=94}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the Knossos tablets record c. 80,000-100,000 sheep grazing in central [[Crete]], and the quantity of the expected wool from these sheep and their offspring, as well as how this wool was allocated.&lt;ref name=Budin94/&gt; The archives of Pylos display a specialized workforce, where each worker belonged to a precise category and was assigned to a specific task in the stages of production, notably in textiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chadwick|1976|p=152}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, palatial control over resources appears to have been highly selective in spatial terms and in terms of how different industries were managed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Olsen|2014|p=6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, sectors like the production of perfumed oil and bronze materials were directly monitored from the palace, but the production of ceramics was only indirectly monitored.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Budin|2009|p=96}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Regional transactions between the palaces are also recorded on a few occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tartaron|2013|p=24}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Large-scale infrastructure===
The palatial centers organized their workforce and resources for the construction of large scale projects in the fields of agriculture and industry.&lt;ref name=Cline145/&gt; The magnitude of some projects indicates that this was the result of combined efforts from multiple palatial centers.  Most notable of them are the drainage system of the [[Lake Copais|Kopais]] basin in Boeotia, the building of a large dam outside Tiryns, and the drainage of the swamp in the [[Nemea]] valley.&lt;ref name="Kelder116"&gt;{{harvnb|Kelder|2010|p=116}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Also noticeable is the construction of harbors, such as the harbor of Pylos, that were capable of accommodating large Bronze Age era vessels like the one found at [[Uluburun shipwreck|Uluburun]].&lt;ref name="Kelder116"/&gt; The Mycenaean economy also featured large-scale manufacturing as testified by the extent of workshop complexes that have been discovered, the largest known to date being the recent ceramic and hydraulic installations found in [[Euonymeia]], next to Athens, that produced tableware, textiles, sails, and ropes for [[export]] and [[shipbuilding]].&lt;ref name="Gilstrap"&gt;{{cite conference|last=Gilstrap|first=William|last2=Day|first2=Peter|last3=Kaza|first3=Konstantina|last4=Kardamaki|first4=Elina|title=Pottery Production at the Late Mycenaean site of Alimos, Attica|conference=Materials and Industries in the Mycenaean World: Current Approaches to the Study of Materials and Industries in Prehistoric Greece, University of Nottingham, 9–10 May 2013|conferenceurl=https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/archaeology/documents/conferences/ahrc-conference-abstracts.pdf|place=Nottingham, UK|date=9 May 2013|pages=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous project of the Mycenaean era was the network of roads in the [[Peloponnese]].&lt;ref name="Kelder116"/&gt; This appears to have facilitated the speedy deployment of troops—for example, the remnants of a Mycenaean road, along with what appears to have been a Mycenaean defensive wall on the [[Isthmus of Corinth]]. The Mycenaean era saw the zenith of infrastructure engineering in Greece, and this appears not to have been limited to the Argive plain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelder|2010|p=117}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trade===
[[File:Earring Mycenae Louvre Bj135.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Gold earring, ca. 1600 BC, Louvre Museum]]
[[File:Megiste-Bronze Reconstruction of a Mycenaean ship.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction of a Mycenaean ship]]
Trade over vast areas of the Mediterranean was essential for the economy of Mycenaean Greece.&lt;ref name=Cline145/&gt; The Mycenaean palaces imported raw materials, such as metals, ivory and glass, and exported processed commodities and objects made from these materials, in addition to local products: oil, perfume, wine, wool and pottery.&lt;ref name=Cline145&gt;{{harvnb|Cline|2012|p=145}}.&lt;/ref&gt; International trade of that time was not only conducted by palatial emissaries but also by independent merchants.&lt;ref name="Cline200"/&gt;

Based on archaeological findings in the Middle East, in particular physical artifacts, textual references, inscriptions and wall paintings, it appears that Mycenaean Greeks achieved strong commercial and cultural interaction with most of the Bronze Age people living in this region: [[Canaan]]ites, [[Kassites]], [[Mitanni]], [[History of the Assyrian people#Ancient Assyria|Assyrians]], and [[Ancient Egyptians|Egyptians]].&lt;ref name=Cline200&gt;{{harvnb|Cline|2007|p=200}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stubbings|1951|loc=IV: Mycenaean II Pottery in Syria and Palestine; V: Mycenaean III Pottery in Syria and Palestine}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Petrie|1894}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The 14th century [[Uluburun shipwreck]], off the coast of southern Anatolia, displays the established trade routes that supplied the Mycenaeans with all the raw materials and items that the economy of Mycenaean Greece needed, such as copper and tin for the production of bronze products.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cline|2012|pp=300, 387, 787}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A chief export of the Mycenaeans was [[olive oil]], which was a multi-purpose product.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Castleden|2005|p=107: "Huge quantities of olive oil were produced and it must have been a major source of wealth. The simple fact that southern Greece is far more suitable climatically for olive production may explain why the Mycenaean civilization made far greater advances in the south than in the north. The oil had a variety of uses, in cooking, as a dressing, as soap, as lamp oil, and as a base for manufacturing unguents."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyprus appears to be the principal intermediary station between Mycenaean Greece and the Middle East, based on the considerable greater quantities of Mycenaean goods found there.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tartaron|2013|p=29}}; {{harvnb|Kling|1989}}; {{harvnb|Nikolaou|1973}}; {{harvnb|International Archaeological Symposium|1973}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, trade with the [[Hittites|Hittite]] lands in central Anatolia appears to have been limited.&lt;ref name=Cline200/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cline|2007|p=197}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Trade with [[Troy]] is also well attested, while Mycenaean trade routes expanded further to the [[Bosphorus]] and the shores of the [[Black Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cline|2007|p=196}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Mycenaean swords have been found as far away as [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] in the eastern Black Sea coast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bu.edu/historic/hs/september02.html Boston University – The Historical Society].&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial interaction was also intense with the Italian peninsula and the western Mediterranean. Mycenaean products, especially pottery, were exported to [[Magna Grecia|southern Italy]], [[Sicily]] and the [[Aeolian islands]]. Mycenaean products also penetrated further into [[Sardinia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tartaron|2013|p=22}}; {{harvnb|Feuer|2004|pp=155–157}}; {{harvnb|Balmuth|Tykot|1998|loc="The Mycenaeans in Sardinia", p. 400}}; {{harvnb|Runnels|Murray|2001|p=15}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ridgway|1992|p=4}}; {{harvnb|Taylour|1958}}; {{harvnb|Fisher|1998}}; {{harvnb|Runnels|Murray|2001|p=15}}; {{harvnb|Vianello|2005|loc="Eastern Sicily and the Aeolian Islands", p. 51}}; {{harvnb|Feuer|2004|pp=155–157}}; {{harvnb|van Wijngaarden|2002|loc=Part IV: The Central Mediterranean, pp. 203-260}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as southern [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|de la Cruz|1988|pp=77–92}}; {{harvnb|Ridgway|1992|p=3}}; {{harvnb|Runnels|Murray|2001|p=15}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sporadic objects of Mycenaean manufacture were found in various distant locations, like in Central Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Castleden|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; such as in [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]], where an amber object inscribed with Linear B symbols has been unearthed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kranznet.indi.de/brzeit/goldfund/bernstei.htm |title=Amber object bearing Linear B symbols |access-date=February 9, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160830122309/http://www.kranznet.indi.de/brzeit/goldfund/bernstei.htm |archive-date=August 30, 2016 |location=Freising |year=1999 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mycenaean bronze double axes and other objects dating from the 13th century BC have been found in [[Ireland]] and in [[Wessex]] and [[Cornwall]] in [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Budin|2009|loc=p. 53: "One of the most extraordinary examples of the extent of Mycenaean influence was the Pelynt Dagger, a fragment of a Late Helladic III sword, which has come to light in the tomb of a Wessex chieftain in southern England!"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Feuer|2004|p=259}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==

Temples and shrines are strangely rare in the Mycenaean archaeological sites. Monumental cultic structures are absent at all the palatial centers, with the exception of Mycenae. However, the cultic center of Mycenae seems to have been a later (13th century BC) development.&lt;ref name=Kelder115/&gt; Small shrines have been identified in [[Asine]], Berbati, Malthi and Pylos,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Castleden|2005|p=146}}.&lt;/ref&gt; while a number of sacred enclosures have been located near Mycenae, [[Delphi]] and [[Amyclae|Amyklae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Castleden|2005|p=157}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Linear B records mention a number of sanctuaries dedicated to a variety of deities, at least in Pylos and Knossos. They also indicate that there were various religious festivities including offerings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelder|2010|p=114}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Written Mycenaean records mention various priests and priestesses who were responsible for specific shrines and temples.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Castleden|2005|p=144}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter were prominent figures in society, and the role of Mycenaean women in religious festivities was also important, just as in [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] Crete.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Castleden|2005|p=160}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mycenaean pantheon already included many divinities that were subsequently encountered in Classical Greece,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Paul|first=Adams John|title=Mycenaean Divinities|location=Northridge, CA|publisher=California State University|date=10 January 2010|accessdate=25 September 2013|url=http://www.csun.edu/~hcfll004/mycen.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it is difficult to determine whether these deities had the characteristics and responsibilities that would be attributed to them in later periods.&lt;ref name=Castleden143&gt;{{harvnb|Castleden|2005|p=143}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the same divinities were worshipped throughout the Mycenaean palatial world. There may be some indications for local deities at various sites, in particular in Crete. The uniformity of Mycenaean religion is also reflected in archaeological evidence with the phi- and psi-figurines that have been found all over Late Bronze Age Greece.&lt;ref name=Kelder115&gt;{{harvnb|Kelder|2010|p=115}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Poseidon]] (Linear B: ''Po-se-da-o'') seems to have occupied a place of privilege. He was a [[chthonic]] deity, connected with earthquakes (''E-ne-si-da-o-ne'': Earth-shaker), but it seems that he also represented the river spirit of the underworld.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nilsson|1940}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paean (god)|Paean]] (''Pa-ja-wo'') is probably the precursor of the Greek physician of the gods in Homer's ''[[Iliad]]''. He was the personification of the magic-song which was supposed to "heal" the patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nilsson|1967|loc=Volume I, pp. 500–504}}; {{harvnb|Chadwick|1976|loc=p. 88: "''Pa-ja-wo'' suggested Homeric Paieon, which earlier would have been ''Paiawon'', later ''Paidn'', an alternative name of Apollo, if not again a separate god."}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of divinities have been identified in the Mycenaean scripts only by their [[epithet]]s used during later antiquity. For example, ''Qo-wi-ja'' ("cow-eyed") is a standard Homeric ephithet of Hera.&lt;ref name="Chadwick 1976 95"/&gt; Ares appeared under the name ''Enyalios'' (assuming that ''Enyalios'' is not a separate god).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chadwick|1976|pp=95, 99}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Additional divinities that can be also found in later periods include [[Hephaestus]], [[Erinyes|Erinya]], [[Artemis]] (''a-te-mi-to'' and ''a-ti-mi-te'') and [[Dionysos]] (''Di-wo-nu-so'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nilsson|1967|loc=Volume I, pp. 565–568}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chadwick|1976|p=99}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chadwick|Baumbach|1963|p=176f}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kn V 52 (text 208 in Ventris and Chadwick); {{harvnb|Chadwick|1976|p=88}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zeus]] also appears in the Mycenaean pantheon, but he was certainly not the chief deity.&lt;ref name=Castleden143/&gt;

A collection of "ladies" or "mistresses", ''Po-ti-ni-ja'' (''Potnia'') are named in the Mycenaean scripts. As such, [[Athena]] (''A-ta-na'') appears in an inscription at [[Knossos]] as ''mistress Athena'', similar to a later [[Homer]]ic expression, but in the Pylos tablets she is mentioned without any accompanying word.&lt;ref name="Mylonas159"/&gt; ''Si-to po-ti-ni-ja'' appears to be an agricultural goddess, possibly related to [[Demeter]] of later antiquity,&lt;ref name="Chadwick 1976 95"&gt;{{harvnb|Chadwick|1976|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in Knossos there is the "mistress of the Labyrinth".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chadwick|1976|pp=92–93}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The "two queens and the king" (''wa-na-ssoi'', ''wa-na-ka-te'') are mentioned in Pylos.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mylonas|1966|loc=p. 159: "Wa-na-ssoi, wa-na-ka-te, (to the two queens and the king). Wanax is best suited to Poseidon, the special divinity of Pylos. The identity of the two divinities addressed as wanassoi, is uncertain."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chadwick|1976|p=76}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Goddess ''Pe-re-swa'' mentioned may be related to Persephone.&lt;ref name="Chadwick 1976 95"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mylonas159"&gt;{{harvnb|Mylonas|1966|p=159}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of Mycenaean divinities seem to have no later equivalents, such as Marineus, Diwia and Komawenteia.&lt;ref name=Castleden143/&gt;

==Architecture==

===Palaces===
[[File:Tiryns, map of the palace and the surrounding fortifications.png|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Tiryns]], map of the palace and the surrounding fortifications]]
The palatial structures at Mycenae, Tiryns and Pylos were erected on the summits of hills or rocky outcrops, dominating the immediate surroundings.&lt;ref name=Fields19&gt;{{harvnb|Fields|2004|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best preserved are found in Pylos and Tiryns, while Mycenae and the Menelaion are only partially preserved. In Central Greece, Thebes and Orchomenos have been only partially exposed. On the other hand, the palace built at the [[acropolis of Athens]] has been almost completely destroyed. A substantial building at [[Dimini]] in Thessaly, possibly ancient [[Iolcos]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cline|2012|p=485}}&lt;/ref&gt; is believed by a number of archaeologists to be a palace.&lt;ref name=Fields19/&gt; A Mycenaean palace has been also unearthed in [[Laconia]], near the modern village of Xirokambi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ταράντου|first=Σοφία|title=Βρήκαν μυκηναϊκό ανάκτορο|publisher=Ethnos.gr|date=28 April 2009|accessdate=25 September 2013|url=http://www.ethnos.gr/article.asp?catid=22733&amp;subid=2&amp;pubid=3320805&amp;tag=8777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hearth of the megaron of Pylos.jpg|thumb|The hearth of the [[megaron]] of Pylos]]

The palatial structures of mainland Greece share a number of common features.&lt;ref name=Kelder109&gt;{{harvnb|Kelder|2010|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; The focal point of the socio-political aspect of a Mycenaean palace was the [[megaron]], the throne room.&lt;ref name=Fields19/&gt; It was laid out around a circular hearth surrounded by four columns. The throne was generally found on the right-hand side upon entering the room, while the interior of the megaron was lavishly decorated, flaunting images designed intentionally to demonstrate the political and religious power of the ruler.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fields|2004|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Access to the megaron was provided through a court, which was reached from a [[Propylaea|propylon]].&lt;ref name=Kelder109/&gt; The iconography of the palatial chambers is remarkably uniform throughout Greece. For instance, in Pylos and Tiryns the paintings are focused on marine motifs, providing depictions of octopi, fish and dolphins.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelder|2010|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the megaron a group of courtyards each opened upon several rooms of different dimensions, such as storerooms and workshops, as well as reception halls and living quarters.&lt;ref name=Kelder109/&gt; In general Mycenaean palaces have yielded a wealth of artifacts and fragmentary frescoes.&lt;ref name=Kelder109/&gt;

Additional common features are shared by the palaces of Pylos, Mycenae and Tiryns;&lt;ref name=Kelder109/&gt; a large court with colonnades lies directly in front of the central megaron,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fields|2004|p=20}}.&lt;/ref&gt; while a second, but smaller, megaron is also found inside these structures.&lt;ref name=Kelder109/&gt; The staircases in the palace of [[Pylos]] indicate that the palaces had two stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fields|2004|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; The private quarters of the members of the royal family were presumably located on the second floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fields|2004|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fortifications===
[[File:MicenePortaLeoniMura.jpg|thumb|[[Cyclopean masonry]] in the southern walls of Mycenae]]
The construction of defensive structures was closely linked to the establishment of the palaces in mainland Greece. The principal Mycenaean centers were well-fortified and usually situated on an elevated terrain, like on the [[acropolis]] of [[Athens]], [[Tiryns]] and [[Mycenae]] or on coastal plains, in the case of [[Gla]].&lt;ref name=Fields10/&gt; Mycenaean Greeks in general appreciated the symbolism of war as expressed in defensive architecture, reflected by the visual impressiveness of their fortifications.&lt;ref name=Fields10/&gt;

[[File:Passageway of the galleries within the walls of Tiryns.jpg|thumb|right|Part of the galleries within the walls of [[Tiryns]]]]

''[[Cyclopean masonry|Cyclopean]]'' is the term normally applied to the masonry characteristics of Mycenaean fortification systems and describes walls built of large, unworked boulders more than {{convert|8|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} thick and weighing several metric tonnes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schofield|2006|p=78}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They were roughly fitted together without the use of mortar or clay to bind them, though smaller hunks of limestone fill the interstices. Their placement formed a polygonal pattern giving the curtain wall an irregular but imposing appearance.&lt;ref name=Fields11&gt;{{harvnb|Fields|2004|p=11}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At the top it would have been wide enough for a walkway with a narrow protective [[parapet]] on the outer edge and with hoop-like [[crenellations]].&lt;ref name=Fields11/&gt; The term ''Cyclopean'' was derived by the latter Greeks of the [[Classical Greece|Classical era]] who believed that only the mythical giants, the [[Cyclops|Cyclopes]], could have constructed such megalithic structures.&lt;ref name=Fields10/&gt; On the other hand, cut stone masonry is used only in and around gateways.&lt;ref name=Fields11/&gt; Another typical feature of Mycenaean megalithic construction was the use of a relieving triangle above a lintel block—an opening, often triangular, designed to reduce the weight over the lintel. The space was filled with some lighter stone.&lt;ref name=Fields11/&gt;

Cyclopean fortifications were typical of Mycenaean walls, especially at the citadels of Mycenae, Tiryns, [[Argos#Ancient|Argos]], [[Chrisso, Phocis#History|Crisa]] and Athens, while smaller boulders are found in [[Midea, Greece|Midea]] and large limestone slabs are found at Gla.&lt;ref name=Fields11/&gt; In the Mycenaean settlements found in [[Epirus]] and [[Cyprus]], Cyclopean-style walls are also present,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tandy|2001|p=20}}: "In LH IBBB (ca. 1310-1190), Mycenaean material culture spread widely throughout coastal and inland Epirus; in this period Mycenaean engagement in Epirus was strongest, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Though the Kiperi tholos may have gone out of use early in LH IIIB, the Cyclopean wall found there, as well as those at Ephyra, Kastriza, and Ayia Eleni, cannot have been built (and probably after) LH IIIB."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Iacovou|2013|p=610}}. Iacovou quotes Vassos Karageorghis who states that "The introduction of 'Cyclopean'-type walls at the very beginning of the LC IIIA period at Enkomi, Kition, Sinda and Maa-Palaeokastron was due to the arrival of Mycenaean settlers in Cyprus."&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in western Anatolia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelder|2010|p=127}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the citadels, isolated forts were also erected on various strategic locations. The fortification systems also incorporated technical refinements such as secret cisterns, galleries, sally ports and projecting bastions for the protection of gateways.&lt;ref name=Fields10&gt;{{harvnb|Fields|2004|p=10}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the palace of Pylos, although a major center of power, paradoxically appears to have been left without any defensive walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fields|2004|p=44}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other architectural features===
Mycenaean domestic architecture originates mainly from earlier Middle Helladic traditions (c. 2000–1650 BC) both in shape, as well as in location of settlement. The observed uniformity in domestic architecture came probably as a result of a shared past among the communities of the Greek mainland rather than as a consequence of cultural expansion of the Mycenaean Koine.&lt;ref name=Kelder107&gt;{{harvnb|Kelder|2010|p=107}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, varying sizes of mudbricks were used in the construction of buildings.&lt;ref name="Kelder109"/&gt;

Contrary to popular belief, some Mycenaean representative buildings already featured roofs made of fired tiles, as in [[Gla]] and [[Midea (Argolid)|Midea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wikander|1990|p=288}}; {{harvnb|Shear|2000|p=134}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Warfare==
{{Main|Military of Mycenaean Greece}}
The military nature of the Mycenaean Greeks is evident from the numerous weapons unearthed, the use of warrior and combat representations in contemporary art, and the preserved Greek [[Linear B]] records.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cline|2012|p=305}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cline313&gt;{{harvnb|Cline|2012|p=313}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mycenaeans invested in the development of military infrastructure, with military production and logistics being supervised directly from the palatial centers.&lt;ref name=Cline313/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Palaima|1999|pp=367–368}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Linear B records in the palace of [[Pylos]], every rural community (the ''damos'') was obliged to supply a certain number of men who had to serve in the army. Similar service was also performed by the aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|D'Amato|Salimbeti|2011|p=10}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Replicas of Mycenaean swords and cups.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Replicas of Mycenaean swords and cups]]
Mycenaean armies were initially based on heavy infantry, equipped with spears, large shields and in some occasion armor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Howard|2011|p=7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the 13th century BC, Mycenaean warfare underwent major changes both in tactics and weaponry and armed units became more uniform and flexible, while weapons became smaller and lighter.&lt;ref name="Cline313"/&gt; The spear remained the main weapon among Mycenaean warriors, while the sword played a secondary role in combat.&lt;ref name=Howard50&gt;{{harvnb|Howard|2011|p=50}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other offensive weapons used were bows, maces, axes, slings and javelins.&lt;ref name=Howard50/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schofield|2006|p=306}}; {{harvnb|D'Amato|Salimbeti|2011|p=13}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The precise role and contribution of [[war chariot|chariots]] on the battlefield is a matter of dispute due to the lack of sufficient evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Howard|2011|p=63}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It appears that chariots were initially used as fighting vehicles during the 16th to 14th centuries BC, while later, in the 13th century BC, their role was limited to battlefield transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fields|2004|p=22}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[boar's tusk helmet]] was the most identifiable piece of Mycenaean armor in use from the beginning to the collapse of Mycenaean culture. It is also known from several depictions in contemporary art in Greece and the Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schofield|2006|p=119}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Salimbeti23&gt;{{harvnb|D'Amato|Salimbeti|2011|p=23}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A representative piece of Mycenaean armor is the [[Dendra panoply]] (c. 1450–1400 BC) which consisted of a cuirass of a complete set of armor made up of several elements of bronze.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|D'Amato|Salimbeti|2011|p=27}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, most features of the later [[Hoplite#Equipment|hoplite panoply]] of classical Greek antiquity, were already known to Mycenaean Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kagan|Viggiano|2013|p=36: "In fact, most of the essential items of the "hoplite panoply" were known to Mycenaean Greece, including the metallic helmet and the single thrusting spear."}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Figure-of-eight" shields were the most common type of Mycenaean shields.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|D'Amato|Salimbeti|2011|p=20}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Late Mycenaean period, smaller types of shields were adopted, either of completely circular shape, or almost circular with a part cut out from their lower edge.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cline|2012|p=312}}; {{harvnb|Schofield|2006|p=123}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art and craftwork==

===Vessels===
{{main|Mycenaean pottery}}
[[File:Bull head rhyton Mycenae Grave IV, from Grave Circle A at Mycenae, 16th century BC (Archaeological Museum, Athens).jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Silver repoussé [[rhyton]] with gold horns, from [[Grave Circle A, Mycenae|Grave Circle A]] at Mycenae, 16th century BC (Archaeological Museum, [[Athens]])]]

During the Late Mycenaean period (1400–1200 BC), Mycenaean vessels/pottery exhibited similarities spanning a significant area of the Eastern Mediterranean (i.e., from the Levant to Sicily) and possibly reflecting a form of economic and political union centered at Mycenae.&lt;ref name=Castleden135&gt;{{harvnb|Castleden|2005|p=135}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the pottery of Crete during this time remained distinct indicating a degree of autonomy on the island.&lt;ref name=Castleden135/&gt; The Mycenaean Greeks produced in large quantities a variety of diversely-styled vessels such as stirrup jars, large bowls, [[alabastron]], [[krater]] and stemmed cups (or [[kylix (drinking cup)|kylikes]]) resembling champagne glasses.&lt;ref name=Castleden135/&gt;

Stirrup jars (Linear B: ''ka-ra-re-u'', khlareus; "oil vessel"), specifically, were first invented on the island of Crete during the 16th century BC and used widely by the Mycenaeans from 1400 BC onward for transporting and storing wine and oil; the jars were usually pear-shaped or globular.&lt;ref name=Castleden135/&gt; As for stemmed cups (or kylikes), they evolved from Ephyraean goblets and a large quantity was discovered at a site called the "Potter's Shop" located in Zygouries.&lt;ref name=Castleden135/&gt; Mycenaean drinking vessels such as the stemmed cups contained single decorative motifs such as a [[Seashell|shell]], an [[octopus]] or a [[flower]] painted on the side facing away from the drinker.&lt;ref name=Castleden135/&gt; The Mycenaean Greeks also painted entire scenes (called "Pictorial Style") on their vessels depicting warriors, chariots, horses and deities reminiscent of events described in Homer's ''Iliad''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Castleden|2005|pp=135–137: "Large kraters decorated in Pictorial Style are found almost exclusively in Cyprus, and for a long time it was naturally assumed that they were manufactured there, but a few examples have been found on the Greek mainland, mostly near Mycenae, and it has now been established that they were all manufactured at workshops close to Mycenae, probably at Berbati just to the east of the city, where there are the right clay sources. The ware was probably specifically made for export to Cyprus, where they were used as centerpieces for drinking ceremonies. The decoration appears to have been painted on at high speed and the effect is sometimes crude; Reynold Higgins calls it 'barbarous', which is a fair description, but the scenes showing warriors, horses and chariots can still tell us much about everyday life in Mycenaean Greece, and as much again about Mycenaean religious beliefs and mythology. One krater from Enkomi in Cyprus shows a charioteer with his groom riding along, perhaps into battle, while a long-robed god, Zeus perhaps, stands in his way holding the scales of destiny that will decide his fate. It is an archetypal scene reminiscent of several in the ''Iliad'', where the gods are shown intervening in battle and deciding the outcome."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other items developed by the Mycenaeans include clay lamps,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Furumark|1941|p=78: "There are two types of Mycenaean lamps. One of these (type 321) has a broad horizontal lip with two opposite depressions for wicks. This type is the clay version of a Minoan stone lamp, known in many examples both from Crete and from the Mainland. The other (type 321 a) has one wick-spout and a handle at the opposite side."}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as metallic vessels such as bronze tripod cauldrons (or basins).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Castleden|2005|pp=56, 166}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A few examples of vessels in [[faience]] and [[ivory]] are also known.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schofield|2006|p=107}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Figures and figurines===
The Mycenaean period has not yielded sculpture of any great size. The statuary of the period consists for the most part of small terracotta figurines found at almost every Mycenaean site in mainland Greece—in tombs, in settlement debris, and occasionally in cult contexts (Tiryns, Agios Konstantinos on [[Methana]]). The majority of these figurines are female and anthropomorphic or zoomorphic. The female figurines can be subdivided into three groups which were popular at different periods: the earliest are the Phi-type, which look like the Greek letter phi and their arms give the upper body of the figurine a rounded shape. The Psi-type looks like the letter Greek psi: these have outstretched upraised arms. The latest (12th century BC) are the Tau-type: these figurines look like the Greek letter tau with folded(?) arms at right angles to the body. Most figurines wear a large 'polos' hat.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|French|1971|pp=101–187}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are painted with stripes or zigzags in the same manner as the contemporary pottery and presumably made by the same potters. Their purpose is uncertain, but they may have served as both votive objects and toys: some are found in children's graves but the vast majority of fragments are from domestic rubbish deposits.&lt;ref&gt;See account of their use in K.A. and Diana Wardle "The Child's Cache at Assiros, Macedonia", in Sally Crawford and Gillian Shepherd (eds): ''Children, Childhood and Society: Institute for Archaeology and Antiquity Interdisciplinary Studies (Volume I)'' Oxford: Archaeopress, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of many of these figurines on sites where worship took place in the Archaic and Classical periods (approximately 200 below the sanctuary of Athena at Delphi, others at the temple of [[Aphaea]] on Aegina, at the sanctuary of Apollo Maleatas above Epidauros and at Amyklae near Sparta), suggests both that many were indeed religious in nature, perhaps as votives, but also that later places of worship may well have first been used in the Mycenaean period.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hägg|Marinatos|1981|loc=Robin Hägg, "Official and Popular Cults in Mycenaean Greece", pp. 35–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Larger male, female or bovine terracotta wheelmade figures are much rarer. An important group was found in the Temple at Mycenae together with coiled clay snakes,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|Taylour|French|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others have been found at Tiryns and in the East and West Shrines at Phylakopi on the island of Melos.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Renfrew|Mountjoy|Macfarlane|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frescoes===
[[File:Fresco of a Mycenaean woman, circa 1300 BC.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|Fresco of a Mycenaean woman]]

The painting of the Mycenaean age was much influenced by that of the Minoan age. Fragments of wall paintings have been found in or around the palaces (Pylos, Mycenae, Tiryns) and in domestic contexts (Zygouries).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Immerwahr|1990}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The largest complete wall painting depicting three female figures, probably goddesses, was found in the so-called "cult center" at Mycenae.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taylour|1969|pp=91–97}}; {{harvnb|Taylour|1970|pp=270–280}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Various themes are represented: hunting, [[Bull-leaping|bull leaping]] (tauromachy), battle scenes, processions, etc. Some scenes may be part of mythological narratives, but if so their meaning eludes us. Other frescoes include geometric or stylised motifs, also used on painted pottery (see above).

==Burial practices==
The usual form of burial during this period was inhumation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cavanagh|Mee|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest Mycenaean burials were mostly in individual graves in the form of a pit or a stone-lined [[cist]] and offerings were limited to pottery and occasional items of jewellery.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taylour|French|Wardle|2007}}; {{harvnb|Alden|2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Groups of pit or cist graves containing elite members of the community were sometimes covered by a tumulus (mound) in the manner established since the Middle Helladic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pelon|1976}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that this form dates back to the [[Kurgan culture]];&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hammond|1967|p=90}}.&lt;/ref&gt; however, Mycenaean burials are in actuality an indigenous development of mainland Greece with the Shaft Graves housing native rulers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dickinson|1977|pp=33–34, 53, 59–60}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Pit and cist graves remained in use for single burials throughout the Mycenaean period alongside more elaborate family graves.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewartowski|2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The shaft graves at Mycenae within Grave Circles [[Grave Circle A, Mycenae|A]] and [[Grave Circle B, Mycenae|B]] belonging to the same period represent an alternative manner of grouping elite burials. Next to the deceased were found full sets of weapons, ornate staffs as well as gold and silver cups and other valuable objects which point to their social rank.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dickinson|1977|pp=53, 107}}; {{harvnb|Anthony|2007|p=48}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{double image|right|Treasury of Atreus, 13th century BC royal tholos tomb near Mycenae-exterior.jpg|200|Treasury of Atreus, 13th century BC royal tholos tomb near Mycenae-interior.jpg|200|[[Treasury of Atreus]], 13th century BC royal tholos tomb near Mycenae: exterior (left) and interior (right) view.}}

Beginning also in the Late Helladic period are to be seen communal tombs of rectangular form.  Nevertheless, it is difficult to establish whether the different forms of burial represent a social hierarchization, as was formerly thought, with the [[Beehive tomb|"tholos"]] being the tombs of the elite rulers, the individual tombs those of the leisure class, and the communal tombs those of the people. Cremations increased in number over the course of the period, becoming quite numerous in the last phase of the Mycenaean era.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Papadimitriou|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The tholos was introduced during the early 15th century as the new and more imposing form of elite burial.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Castleden|2005|p=97}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The most impressive tombs of the Mycenaean era are the monumental royal tombs of Mycenae, undoubtedly intended for the royal family of the city. The most famous is the [[Treasury of Atreus]], a [[Beehive tomb|tholos]]. A total of nine of such tholos tombs are found in the region of Mycenae, while six of them belong to a single period (Late Helladic IIa, c. 1400-1300 BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelder|2010|p=95}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that different dynasties or factions may have competed through conspicuous burial.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Graziado|1991|pp=403–440}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing==
{{main|Linear B}}
[[File:Linear B (Mycenaean Greek) NAMA Tablette 7671.jpg|thumb|Linear B tablets (Mycenaean Greek)]]
In circa 1600 BC, the Mycenaean Greeks borrowed from the [[Minoan civilization]] its syllabic writing system (i.e., [[Linear A]]) and developed their own [[syllabic script]] known as [[Linear B]].&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/Linear-A|title=Linear A and Linear B|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Linear B script was utilized by the Mycenaean palaces in Greece for administrative purposes where economic transactions were recorded on clay tablets and some pottery in the [[Mycenaean Greek|Mycenaean dialect]] of the [[Greek language]].&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; The Linear B tablets were first discovered in [[Crete]] by English archaeologist [[Sir Arthur Evans]] c. 1900 and later deciphered by English architect and cryptographer [[Michael Ventris]] in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Arthur-Evans|title=Sir Arthur Evans|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Michael-Ventris|title=Michael Ventris|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ventris's discovery of an archaic Greek dialect in the Linear B tablets demonstrated that Mycenaean Greek was "the oldest known Greek dialect, elements of which survived in Homer’s language as a result of a long oral tradition of epic poetry."&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt;

==Legacy==
In the 8th century BC, after the end of the so-called [[Greek Dark Ages]], Greece emerged with a network of myths and legends, the greatest of all being that of the Trojan [[Epic Cycle]].&lt;ref name=Castleden2&gt;{{harvnb|Castleden|2005|p=2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the [[Greeks]] of classical antiquity idealized the Mycenaean period as a glorious period of heroes, closeness of the gods and material wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hansen|2004|p=7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The legends of [[Homeric epics|Homer's Epics]] were especially and generally accepted as part of the Greek past and it was not until the 19th century that scholars began to question Homer's historicity.&lt;ref name=Castleden2/&gt; At this time, German archaeologist [[Heinrich Schliemann]] undertook the first modern archaeological excavations in Greece at the site of [[Mycenae]] in 1876.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sansone|2004|loc="Greece in the Bronze Age", pp. 7–8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Schliemann set out to prove the historical accuracy of the ''Iliad'' by identifying the places described by Homer.&lt;ref name=Castleden2/&gt;

As part of the Mycenaean heritage that survived, the names of the gods and goddesses of Mycenaean Greece became major figures of the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian Pantheon]] of later antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Castleden|2005|p=235}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the language of the Mycenaeans offers the first written evidence of [[Greek language|Greek]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Castleden|2005|p=228}}.&lt;/ref&gt; while a significant part of the Mycenaean vocabulary can also be found in modern English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vallance|first1=Richard|title=Did you Know you Speak Mycenaean Greek? You do!|url=https://www.academia.edu/12633620|website=academia.edu|date=2015|accessdate=30 March 2016|quote=Whether we realize it or not, not only are tens of thousands of English words direct derivatives of ancient Greek, but some are derived even from Mycenaean Greek, which makes them very ancient indeed!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mycenaean Greeks were also pioneers in the field of [[engineering]], launching large-scale projects unmatched in Europe until the [[Roman architecture|Roman period]], such as fortifications, bridges, culverts, aqueducts, dams and roads suitable for wheeled traffic. They also made several architectural innovations, such as the [[Discharging arch#History|relieving triangle]].&lt;ref name=Castleden231&gt;{{harvnb|Castleden|2005|p=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were also responsible for transmitting a wide range of arts and crafts, especially of Minoan origin. The Mycenaean civilization was in general more advanced compared to the Late Bronze Age cultures of the rest of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Castleden|2005|p=230}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Several Mycenaean attributes and achievements were borrowed or held in high regard in later periods; so, it would be no exaggeration to consider Mycenaean Greece as a cradle of civilization.&lt;ref name=Castleden231/&gt;

'''Narrative history''' is the practice of writing [[history]] in a story-based form. It tends to entail history-writing based on reconstructing series of short-term events, and since the influential work of [[Leopold von Ranke]] on professionalising history-writing in the nineteenth century has been associated with [[empiricism]]. The term ''narrative history'' thus overlaps with the term ''histoire événementielle'' ('event-history') coined by [[Fernand Braudel]] in the early twentieth century, as he promoted forms of history-writing analysing much longer-term trends (what he called the ''[[longue durée]]'').&lt;ref&gt;''A Dictionary of Cultural and Critical Theory'', ed. by Michael Payne and Jessica Rae Barbera, 2nd edn (Chichester: Wiley-Blackwell, 2013), s.v. 'Braudel, Fernand' (p. 90).&lt;/ref&gt;

Though history is considered a social science, the story-based nature of history allows for the inclusion of a greater or lesser degree of narration in addition to an analytical or interpretative exposition of historical knowledge. It can be divided into two subgenres: the traditional narrative and the modern narrative.

'''Traditional narrative''' focuses on the chronological order of history. It is event driven and tends to center upon individuals, action, and intention. For example, in regard to the [[French Revolution]], a historian who works with the traditional narrative might be more interested in the revolution as a single entity (one revolution), centre it in [[Paris]], and rely heavily upon major figures such as [[Maximilien Robespierre]].

Conversely, '''modern narrative''' typically focuses on structures and general trends. A modern narrative would break from rigid chronology if the historian felt it explained the concept better. In terms of the French Revolution, a historian working with the modern narrative might show general traits that were shared by revolutionaries across [[France]] but would also illustrate regional variations from those general trends (many confluent revolutions). Also this type of historian might use different sociological factors to show why different types of people supported the general revolution.

Historians who use the modern narrative might say that the traditional narrative focuses too much on what happened and not enough on why and causation. Also, that this form of narrative reduces history into neat boxes and thereby does an injustice to history. [[J H Hexter]] characterized such historians as "lumpers". In an essay on [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]], he remarked that "lumpers do not like accidents: they would prefer them vanish...The lumping historian wants to put all of the past into boxes..and then to tie all the boxes together into one nice shapely bundle."

Historians who use traditional narrative might say that the modern narrative overburdens the reader with trivial data that had no significant effect on the progression of history. They believe that the historian needs to stress what is consequential in history, as otherwise the reader might believe that minor trivial events were more important than they were.

{{Culture of Romania}}
The '''National Register of Historic Monuments''' ({{lang-ro|'''Lista Monumentelor Istorice (LMI)'''}}) is the official English name of the [[Romania]] government's list of [[National Heritage Site]]s known as [[Monument istoric|Monumente istorice]]. In Romania, these include sites, buildings, structures, and objects considered worthy of preservation due to the importance of their Romanian [[cultural heritage]]. The list,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cultura.ro/page/43 The official list of Historical Monuments] at the Romanian Institute for National Cultural Heritage&lt;/ref&gt; created in 2004, contains places that have been designated by the [[Ministry of Culture and National Patrimony (Romania)|Ministry of Culture and National Patrimony]] of Romania and are maintained by the [[Romanian National Institute of Historical Monuments]], as being of national historic significance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inmi.ro/index.html The National Institute of Historical Monuments]&lt;/ref&gt;

==LMI Code==
The ''LMI code'' (List of the Historical Monuments code) identifies uniquely an historical monument or archaeological site, and includes, in this order:
* [[Counties of Romania|Romanian county]] code, using [[ISO 3166-2:RO]]
* A Roman numeral indicating the type of monument:
** I: archaeological
** II: architectural
** III: public monuments (e. g. statues)
** IV: memorials and gravestones
* A lowercase letter: ''m'' for an individual monument, ''a'' for an ensemble and ''s'' for an archaeological site
* A capital letter: A for monuments of national interest, B for local interest
* A five-digit serial number. If the site is part of an ensemble, this is indicated by a decimal point followed by 01, 02, and so forth.

For example, IS-II-a-A-03806 is the LMI code for [[Cetățuia Monastery]]. IS indicates the site is in [[Iași County]]. II indicates it is an architectural monument, a that it is an ensemble, A that it is of national interest, and 03806 is its unique code. The ensemble has six individual sites, so for instance the monastery's bell tower, the fifth site listed, has code IS-II-m-A-03806.05.

Sites may also have a RAN Code, indicating they are part of the National Archaeological Record (''Repertoriul Arheologic Național''), a register including sites with archaeological potential, sites where archaeological excavations have taken place or ruined archaeological sites.

'''Norumbega''', or '''Nurembega''', is a legendary settlement in northeastern [[North America]] which appeared on many early maps from the 1500s until American colonization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Did Leif Erikson once live in Cambridge, Massachusetts? | work = The Straight Dope | url =  http://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/mleifinma.html | accessdate = 2008-08-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andy Woodruff, [http://andywoodruff.com/blog/norumbega-new-englands-lost-city-of-riches-and-vikings/ Norumbega, New England’s lost city of riches and Vikings], May 24, 2010; accessed 2018.01.25.&lt;/ref&gt;  The houses were said to have pillars of gold and the inhabitants carried quarts of pearls on their heads.&lt;ref name = "Schweitzer" /&gt;

[[Jean Allefonsce]] in 1542 reported that he had coasted south from [[Newfoundland]] and had discovered a great river.&lt;!--this sentence doesn't fit, especially with the 1529 bap mentioned below--&gt; It often appeared on subsequent European maps of North America, lying south of [[Acadia]] in what is now [[New England]].  The town of [[Bangor, Maine]], embraced the legend in the nineteenth century, naming their municipal hall "Norumbega Hall".  In 1886 inventor [[Joseph Barker Stearns]] built a mansion named "[[Norumbega Castle]]", which still stands on [[US Route 1]] in [[Camden, Maine]], overlooking [[Penobscot Bay]].&lt;ref name = "Schweitzer"&gt;

In the late 19th century, [[Eben Norton Horsford]] linked the name and legend of Norumbega to supposed [[Norse colonization of the Americas|Norse settlements]] on the [[Charles River]], and built the [[Norumbega Tower]] at the confluence of [[Stony Brook (Waltham)|Stony Brook]] and the Charles in [[Weston, Massachusetts]], where he believed Fort Norumbega was located. In honor of Horsford's generous donations to [[Wellesley College]], a building named Norumbega Hall was dedicated in 1886 and celebrated in a poem by [[John Greenleaf Whittier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Greenleaf |first=John |title=The writings of John Greenleaf Whittier |volume=4 |year=1894 |publisher=Houghton, Mifflin and company | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ly0AAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA222&amp;lpg=PA222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "Norumbega" was originally spelled ''Oranbega'' in [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]]'s 1529 map of America, and the word is believed to derive from one of the [[Algonquian languages]] spoken in New England. It may mean "quiet place between the rapids" or "quiet stretch of water".&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Pompeii-couple.jpg|thumb|right|This wall painting found in the Roman city of [[Pompeii]] is an example of a primary source about people in Pompeii in Roman times. ([[Portrait of Paquius Proculo]])]]

In the study of [[history]] as an academic discipline, a '''primary source''' (also called an '''original source''') is an [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]], document, diary, [[manuscript]], [[autobiography]], recording, or any other source of [[information]] that was created at the time under study. It serves as an original source of information about the topic. Similar definitions can be used in [[library science]], and other areas of scholarship, although different fields have somewhat different definitions. In [[journalism]], a primary source can be a person with direct knowledge of a situation, or a document written by such a person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Journalism: Primary Sources|url=http://infoguides.pepperdine.edu/c.php?g=287355&amp;p=1915752|publisher=Pepperdine University|accessdate=January 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Primary sources are distinguished from [[secondary sources]], which cite, comment on, or build upon primary sources. Generally, accounts written after the fact with the benefit (and possible distortions) of hindsight are secondary.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20130726061349/http://www.lib.umd.edu/ues/guides/primary-sources Primary, secondary and tertiary sources]". University Libraries, University of Maryland. &lt;/ref&gt; A secondary source may also be a primary source depending on how it is used.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ithacalibrary.com/sp/subjects/primary Primary and secondary sources]". Ithaca College Library.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a memoir would be considered a primary source in research concerning its author or about his or her friends characterized within it, but the same memoir would be a secondary source if it were used to examine the culture in which its author lived. "Primary" and "secondary" should be understood as relative terms, with sources categorized according to specific historical contexts and what is being studied.&lt;ref name=Handlin/&gt;{{rp|118–246}}&lt;ref name=Kragh&gt;{{Cite book| last=Kragh| first=Helge| title=An Introduction to the Historiography of Science| year=1989| publisher=Cambridge University Press| isbn=0-521-38921-6| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d2zy_QSq2b0C&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;dq=%22secondary+source%22+historiography |page=121 |quote=[T]he distinction is not a sharp one.

In scholarly writing, an important objective of classifying sources is to determine their independence and reliability.&lt;ref name=Kragh/&gt; In contexts such as historical writing, it is almost always advisable to use primary sources and that "if none are available, it is only with great caution that [the author] may proceed to make use of secondary sources."&lt;ref name=Cipolla&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cipolla|first=Carlo M.|title=Between Two Cultures:An Introduction to Economic History|page=27|publisher=W.

That this imposition is basic in any understanding of the past is clear from the rules that documents should not be altered, or that any material damaging to a historian's argument or purpose should not be left out or suppressed. These rules mean that the sources or the texts of the past have an integrity and that they do indeed 'speak for themselves', and that they are necessary constraints through which past reality imposes itself on the historian.|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other fields===
In scholarly writing, the objective of classifying sources is to determine the independence and reliability of sources.&lt;ref name=Kragh/&gt; Though the terms ''primary source'' and ''secondary source'' originated in [[historiography]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} as a way to trace the history of historical ideas, they have been applied to many other fields. For example, these ideas may be used to trace the history of scientific theories, literary elements and other information that is passed from one author to another.

In [[scientific literature]], a primary source is the original publication of a scientist's new data, results and theories. In [[political history]], primary sources are documents such as official reports, speeches, pamphlets, posters, or letters by participants, official election returns and eyewitness accounts. In the [[history of ideas]] or [[intellectual history]], the main primary sources are books, essays and letters written by intellectuals; these intellectuals may include historians, whose books and essays are therefore considered primary sources for the intellectual historian, though they are secondary sources in their own topical fields. In [[religious history]], the primary sources are [[religious texts]] and descriptions of religious [[ceremonies]] and [[rituals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://researchguides.library.tufts.edu/content.php?pid=60919&amp;sid=447878|title=Primary Sources - Religion|website=Research Guides at Tufts University|date=26 August 2014|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of [[cultural history]] could include fictional sources such as novels or plays. In a broader sense primary sources also include artifacts like photographs, newsreels, coins, paintings or buildings created at the time. Historians may also take [[Artifact (archaeology)|archaeological artifacts]] and oral reports and interviews into consideration. Written sources may be divided into three types.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Howell | first1 = Martha C. | last2 = Prevenier | first2 = Walter. | title = From reliable sources : an introduction to historical method | year = 2001 | publisher = Cornell University Press | location = Ithaca, N.Y. | isbn = 0-8014-8560-6 | pages =20–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Narrative]] sources''' or '''literary sources''' tell a story or message. They are not limited to fictional sources (which can be sources of information for contemporary attitudes) but include [[diary|diaries]], films, biographies, leading philosophical works and [[scientific works]].
*'''Diplomatic sources''' include [[charter]]s and other legal documents which usually follow a set format.
*'''Social documents''' are records created by organizations, such as registers of births and tax records.

In historiography, when the study of history is subject to historical scrutiny, a secondary source becomes a primary source. For a biography of a historian, that historian's publications would be primary sources. Documentary films can be considered a secondary source or primary source, depending on how much the filmmaker modifies the original sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cripps |first=Thomas |year=1995 |title=Historical Truth: An Interview with Ken Burns |journal=American Historical Review |volume=100 |issue=3 |pages=741–764 |doi=10.2307/2168603 |jstor= 2168603|publisher=The American Historical Review, Vol. 100, No. 3 |postscript=. |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lafayette College Library, provides a synopsis of primary sources in several areas of study:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The definition of a primary source varies depending upon the academic discipline and the context in which it is used.&lt;br&gt;
*In the [[humanities]], a primary source could be defined as something that was created either during the time period being studied or afterward by individuals reflecting on their involvement in the events of that time.
*In the [[social sciences]], the definition of a primary source would be expanded to include numerical data that has been gathered to analyze relationships between people, events, and their environment.
*In the [[natural sciences]], a primary source could be defined as a report of original findings or ideas. These sources often appear in the form of research articles with sections on methods and results."&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.lafayette.edu/help/primary/definitions "Primary Sources: what are they?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208191118/http://library.lafayette.edu/help/primary/definitions |date=8 February 2009 }}. Lafayette College Library.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Finding primary sources==
Although many primary sources remain in private hands, others are located in [[archives]], [[libraries]], [[museum]]s, [[historical societies]], and [[special collections]]. These can be public or private. Some are affiliated with universities and colleges, while others are government entities. Materials relating to one area might be spread over a large number of different institutions. These can be distant from the original source of the document. For example, the [[Huntington Library]] in California houses a large number of documents from the United Kingdom.

In the US, digital copies of primary sources can be retrieved from a number of places. The [[Library of Congress]] maintains several digital collections where they can be retrieved. Some examples are [http://www.memory.loc.gov American Memory] and [[Chronicling America]]. The [[National Archives and Records Administration]] also has digital collections in [http://digitalvaults.org/ Digital Vaults]. The [[Digital Public Library of America]] searches across the digitized primary source collections of many libraries, archives, and museums. The [[Internet Archive]] also has primary source materials in many formats.

In the UK, the [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|National Archives]] provides a consolidated search of its own catalogue and a wide variety of other archives listed on the Access to Archives index. Digital copies of various classes of documents at the National Archives (including wills) are available from DocumentsOnline. Most of the available documents relate to England and Wales. Some digital copies of primary sources are available from the [[National Archives of Scotland]]. Many County Record Offices collections are included in Access to Archives, while others have their own on-line catalogues. Many County Record Offices will supply digital copies of documents.

In other regions, [[Europeana]] has digitized materials from across Europe while the [[World Digital Library]] and [[Flickr Commons]] have items from all over the world. [[Trove]] has primary sources from Australia.

Most primary source materials are not digitized and may only be represented online with a record or [[finding aid]]. Both digitized and not digitized materials can be found through catalogs such as [[WorldCat]], the [https://catalog2.loc.gov/ Library of Congress catalog], the [https://www.archives.gov/research/catalog/ National Archives catalog], and so on.

==Using primary sources==
History as an academic discipline is based on primary sources, as evaluated by the community of scholars, who report their findings in books, articles and papers. [[Arthur Marwick]] says "Primary sources are absolutely fundamental to history."&lt;ref name=Marwick&gt;Marwick, Arthur. "Primary Sources: Handle with Care". In Sources and Methods for Family and Community Historians: A Handbook edited by Michael Drake and Ruth Finnegan. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997. {{ISBN|0-521-46580-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ideally, a historian will use all available primary sources that were created by the people involved at the time being studied. In practice some sources have been destroyed, while others are not available for research. Perhaps the only eyewitness reports of an event may be [[memoir]]s, autobiographies, or oral interviews taken years later. Sometimes the only evidence relating to an event or person in the distant past was written or copied decades or centuries later. Manuscripts that are sources for classical texts can be copies of documents, or fragments of copies of documents. This is a common problem in [[classical studies]], where sometimes only a summary of a book or letter has survived. Potential difficulties with primary sources have the result that history is usually taught in schools using secondary sources.

Historians studying the modern period with the intention of publishing an academic article prefer to go back to available primary sources and to seek new (in other words, forgotten or lost) ones. Primary sources, whether accurate or not, offer new input into historical questions and most modern history revolves around heavy use of [[archive]]s and special collections for the purpose of finding useful primary sources. A work on history is not likely to be taken seriously as scholarship if it only cites secondary sources, as it does not indicate that original research has been done.&lt;ref name=Handlin/&gt;

However, primary sources – particularly those from before the 20th century – may have hidden challenges. "Primary sources, in fact, are usually fragmentary, ambiguous and very difficult to analyse and interpret."&lt;ref name=Marwick/&gt; Obsolete meanings of familiar words and social context are among the traps that await the newcomer to historical studies. For this reason, the interpretation of primary texts is typically taught as part of an advanced college or postgraduate history course, although advanced self-study or informal training is also possible.

The following questions are asked about primary sources:
* What is the tone?
* Who is the intended audience?
* What is the purpose of the publication?
* What assumptions does the author make?
* What are the bases of the author's conclusions?
* Does the author agree or disagree with other authors of the subject?
* Does the content agree with what you know or have learned about the issue?
* Where was the source made? (questions of [[systemic bias]])

==Strengths and weaknesses==
In many fields and contexts, such as historical writing, it is almost always advisable to use primary sources if possible, and "if none are available, it is only with great caution that [the author] may proceed to make use of secondary sources."&lt;ref name=Cipolla/&gt; In addition, primary sources avoid the problem inherent in secondary sources in which each new author may distort and put a new spin on the findings of prior cited authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ross|first=Jeffrey Ian|title=Taking Stock of Research Methods and Analysis on Oppositional Political Terrorism|journal=The American Sociologist|volume=35|issue=2|year=2004|pages=26–37|doi=10.1007/BF02692395|quote=The analysis of secondary source information is problematic. The further an investigator is from the primary source, the more distorted the information may be. Again, each new person may put his or her spin on the findings.|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|text="A history, whose author draws conclusions from other than primary sources or secondary sources actually based on primary sources, is by definition [[fiction]] and not history at all."|sign=Kameron Searle|}}

However, a primary source is not necessarily more of an authority or better than a secondary source. There can be [[bias]] and tacit unconscious views which twist historical information.
{{quote|"Original material may be... prejudiced, or at least not exactly what it claims to be."|David Iredale&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Iredale | first1 = David | title = Enjoying archives: what they are, where to find them, how to use them | year = 1973 | publisher = Newton Abbot, David and Charles, | isbn = 0-7153-5669-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The errors may be corrected in secondary sources, which are often subjected to [[peer review]], can be well documented, and are often written by historians working in institutions where methodological accuracy is important to the future of the author's career and reputation. Historians consider the accuracy and [[objectivity (science)|objectiveness]] of the primary sources that they are using and historians subject both primary and secondary sources to a high level of scrutiny. A primary source such as a [[Diary|journal]] entry (or the online version, a blog), at best, may only reflect one individual's [[opinion]] on events, which may or may not be truthful, accurate, or complete.

Participants and [[witness|eyewitness]]es may misunderstand events or distort their reports, deliberately or not, to enhance their own image or importance. Such effects can increase over time, as people create a narrative that may not be accurate.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara W. Sommer and Mary Kay Quinlan, ''The Oral History Manual'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; For any source, primary or secondary, it is important for the researcher to evaluate the amount and direction of bias.&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress, " Analysis of Primary Sources" [http://memory.loc.gov/learn/lessons/psources/analyze.html online 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, a government report may be an accurate and unbiased description of events, but it may be [[censorship|censored]] or altered for propaganda or [[cover-up]] purposes. The facts can be [[distortion|distorted]] to present the opposing sides in a negative light. [[Barrister]]s are taught that evidence in a court case may be truthful but may still be distorted to support or oppose the position of one of the parties.

==Classifying sources==
Many sources can be considered either primary or secondary, depending on the context in which they are examined.&lt;ref name=Kragh/&gt; Moreover, the distinction between ''primary'' and ''secondary'' sources is subjective and contextual,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dalton| first1=Margaret Stieg|last2=Charnigo|first2=Laurie|title=Historians and Their Information Sources|journal=College &amp; Research Libraries|date=September 2004|volume=65|issue=5|page=419| doi=10.5860/crl.65.5.400|url=http://crl.acrl.org/content/65/5/400.full.pdf+html|accessdate=3 January 2017}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that precise definitions are difficult to make.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Delgadillo|first1=Roberto|last2=Lynch|first2=Beverly|title=Future Historians: Their Quest for Information|url=http://crl.acrl.org/content/60/3/245.full.pdf+html|journal=College &amp; Research Libraries|date=May 1999|volume=60|issue=3 |pages=245–259, at 253|quote=[T]he same document can be a primary or a secondary source depending on the particular analysis the historian is doing.|ref=harv}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; A book review, when it contains the opinion of the reviewer about the book rather than a summary of the book, becomes a primary source.&lt;ref name="Princeton"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=book%20review|title=Book reviews |accessdate=22 September 2011 |publisher=Princeton |year=2011 |author=Princeton|work=Scholarly definition document }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VirginiaTech"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lib.vt.edu/find/byformat/bookreviews.html |title=Book reviews |accessdate=22 September 2011 |publisher=Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University |year=2011 |author=Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University |work=Scholarly definition document |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910082750/http://www.lib.vt.edu/find/byformat/bookreviews.html |archivedate=10 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a historical text discusses old documents to derive a new historical conclusion, it is considered to be a primary source for the new conclusion. Examples in which a source can be both primary and secondary include an obituary&lt;ref name=Duffin&gt;{{Cite book|last=Duffin|first=Jacalyn|title=History of Medicine: A Scandalously Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/?id=__oDQ6yDO7kC&amp;pg=PA366&amp;dq=%22secondary+source%22+historiography|year=1999|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=0-8020-7912-1|page=366|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a survey of several volumes of a journal counting the frequency of articles on a certain topic.&lt;ref name=Duffin/&gt;

Whether a source is regarded as primary or secondary in a given context may change, depending upon the present state of knowledge within the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Henige|first=David|title=Primary Source by Primary Source? On the Role of Epidemics in New World Depopulation|journal=Ethnohistory|volume=33|issue=3|year=1986|pages=292–312, at 292|doi=10.2307/481816|jstor=481816|publisher=Ethnohistory, Vol. 33, No. 3|quote=[T]he term 'primary' inevitably carries a relative meaning insofar as it defines those pieces of information that stand in closest relationship to an event or process ''in the present state of our knowledge''. Indeed, in most instances the very nature of a primary source tells us that it is actually derivative.…[H]istorians have no choice but to regard certain of the available sources as 'primary' since they are as near to truly original sources as they can now secure|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a document refers to the contents of a previous but undiscovered letter, that document may be considered "primary", since it is the closest known thing to an original source; but if the letter is later found, it may then be considered "secondary"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Henige|1986|p=292}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some instances, the reason for identifying a text as the "primary source" may devolve from the fact that no copy of the original source material exists, or that it is the oldest extant source for the information cited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Ambraseys|first1=Nicholas|last2=Melville|first2=Charles Peter|last3=Adams|first3=Robin Dartrey|title=The Seismicity of Egypt, Arabia, and the Red Sea|year=1994|isbn=0-521-39120-2|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dtVqdSKnBq4C&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=historiography+%22primary+source%22+%22secondary+source%22|page=7|quote=The same chronicle can be a primary source for the period contemporary with the author, a secondary source for earlier material derived from previous works, but also a primary source when these earlier works have not survived|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forgeries==
Historians must occasionally contend with forged documents that purport to be primary sources. These forgeries have usually been constructed with a fraudulent purpose, such as promulgating legal rights, supporting false pedigrees, or promoting particular interpretations of historic events. The investigation of documents to determine their authenticity is called [[diplomatics]].

For centuries, [[Pope]]s used the forged [[Donation of Constantine]] to bolster the Papacy's secular power. Among the earliest forgeries are false [[Anglo-Saxon charters]], a number of 11th- and 12th-century forgeries produced by [[monastery|monasteries]] and [[abbey]]s to support a claim to land where the original document had been lost or never existed. One particularly unusual forgery of a primary source was perpetrated by [[Sir Edward Dering, 1st Baronet|Sir Edward Dering]], who placed false [[monumental brass]]es in a [[parish church]].&lt;ref&gt;Everyone has Roots: An Introduction to English Genealogy by Anthony J. Camp, published by Genealogical Pub. Co., 1978&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]] "authenticated" the [[Hitler Diaries]], which were later proved to be forgeries. Recently, forged documents have been placed within the [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)#Forgeries discovered in 2005|UK National Archives]] in the hope of establishing a false [[provenance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Introduction to record class R4|url= http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C16525|publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Leppard| first=David|title=Forgeries revealed in the National Archives – Times Online|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article3867853.ece|work=The Sunday Times|date=4 May 2008|accessdate=4 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, historians dealing with recent centuries rarely encounter forgeries of any importance.&lt;ref name=Handlin&gt;[[Oscar Handlin]] and [[Arthur Meier Schlesinger]], ''Harvard Guide to American History'' (1954)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|22–25}}

'''Primitive communism''' is a concept originating from [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] who argued that [[hunter-gatherer]] societies were traditionally based on egalitarian social relations and common ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Dictionary of Sociology  |last=Scott |first=John |authorlink= |author2=Marshall, Gordon |year=2007 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=USA |isbn=978-0-19-860987-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A primary inspiration for both Marx and Engels were [[Lewis Henry Morgan]]'s descriptions of "communism in living" as practised by the [[Iroquois Nation]] of North America.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, L. H. 1881. ''Houses and House-Life of the American Aborigines''. Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In Marx's model of socioeconomic structures, societies with primitive communism had no hierarchical [[social class]] structures or [[capital accumulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Man the Hunter |last=Lee |first=Richard |last2=DeVore |first2=Irven |year=1969 |publisher=Aldine Transaction |isbn=978-0-202-33032-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Engels offered the first detailed theorization of primitive communism in 1884, with publication of  ''[[The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State]]''. Marx and Engels used the term more broadly than Marxists did later, and applied it not only to hunter-gatherers but also to some [[subsistence agriculture]] communities. There is also no agreement among later scholars, including Marxists, on the historical extent, or longevity, of primitive communism.

Marx and Engels also noted how capitalist accumulation latched itself onto social organizations of ''primitive communism''. For instance, in private correspondence the same year that ''The Origin of the Family'' was published, Engels attacked [[European colonialism]], describing the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch regime]] in [[Java (island)|Java]] directly organizing agricultural production and profiting from it, "on the basis of the old communistic village communities".&lt;ref&gt;Engels, cited by T. B. Bottomore, ''A Dictionary of Marxist Thought'', Oxford, Wiley-Blackwell, 1991, p174.&lt;/ref&gt; He added that cases like the Dutch East Indies, [[British Raj|British India]] and the [[Russian Empire]] showed "how today primitive communism furnishes ... the finest and broadest basis of [[exploitation of labour|exploitation]]".

In a primitive communist society, all able bodied persons would have engaged in obtaining food, and everyone would share in what was produced by hunting and gathering.

Domestication of animals and plants following the [[Neolithic Revolution]] through [[herding]] and [[agriculture]] was seen as the turning point from primitive communism to [[class society]] as it was followed by private ownership and [[slavery]], with the inequality that they entailed. In addition, parts of the population specialized in different activities, such as manufacturing, [[culture]], [[philosophy]], and [[science]] which is said to lead to the development of [[social class]]es.&lt;ref name="ablongman" /&gt;

Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; offer theoretical accounts to explain how communistic, assertively egalitarian social arrangements might have emerged in the [[prehistory|prehistoric past]]. Despite differences in emphasis, these and other anthropologists follow Engels in arguing that evolutionary change—resistance to primate-style sexual and political dominance—culminated eventually in a revolutionary transition. [[Richard Borshay Lee]] criticizes the mainstream and [[dominant culture]]'s long-time bias against the possible existence of primitive communism, deriding "[[Bourgeois]] ideology [that] would have us believe that primitive communism doesn't exist. In popular consciousness it is lumped with romanticism, exoticism: the noble savage."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title= ''Richard B. Lee, 1992. "Demystifying Primitive Communism".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6674">'''Protohistory''' is a period between [[prehistory]] and [[history]], during which a [[culture]] or [[civilization]] has not yet developed [[writing]] but other cultures have already noted its existence in their own writings. For example, in [[Europe]], the [[Celt]]s and the [[Germanic tribes]] are considered to have been protohistoric when they began appearing in [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] sources.

Protohistoric may also refer to the transition period between the advent of [[literacy]] in a society and the writings of the first [[historians]]. The preservation of oral traditions may complicate matters as these can provide a secondary historical source for even earlier events. Colonial sites involving a literate group and a non-literate group are also studied as protohistoric situations.

It can also refer to a period in which fragmentary or external historical documents, not necessarily including a developed writing system, have been found. For instance, the [[Proto–Three Kingdoms of Korea]], the [[Yayoi]]&lt;ref&gt;Bahn, Paul (ed.) ''The Penguin Archaeology Guide'' Penguin Books Ltd (29 Nov 2001) {{ISBN|978-0-14-029308-1}} p. 368&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Mississippian culture|Mississippian]] groups recorded by early European explorers are protohistoric.

==Usage of the term==
In ''The Oxford Illustrated History of Prehistoric Europe'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cunliffe |first=Barry |title=The Oxford Illustrated History of Prehistoric Europe |year=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-285441-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an article&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Timothy|title=The Oxford Illustrated Prehistory of Europe|year=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=373–410|authorlink=Timothy Taylor (archaeologist)|editor=Cunliffe, Barry|contribution=Thracians, Scythians and Dacians}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Timothy Taylor (archaeologist)|Timothy Taylor]] says, {{cquote|Because of the existence in some but not all societies of historical writing during the first millennium BC, the period has often been termed 'protohistoric' instead of prehistoric. Of course, the understanding of the past gained through archaeology is broadly different in nature to understanding derived from historical texts. Having both sorts of evidence is a boon and a challenge.}}

In the abstract of a later paper on "slavery in the first millennium Aegean, Carpatho-Balkan and Pontic regions",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Timothy Taylor |title=Believing the Ancients: Quantitative and Qualitative Dimensions of Slavery and the Slave Trade in Later Prehistoric Eurasia |publisher=World Archaeology, Vol. 33, No. 1, The Archaeology of Slavery (Jun., 2001), pp. 27-43 |date=2001 |jstor=827887 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor, who is primarily an archaeologist, says, {{cquote|I have taken the rather unusual step of trusting what the classical authors tell us they knew.}}

For other examples, see also the writings of [[Brian M. Fagan|Brian Fagan]] on the protohistory of North America&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fagan |first=Brian |title=Ancient North America: The Archaeology of a Continent |year=2005 |edition=4th |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |location=London |isbn=978-0-500-28532-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the work of Muhammed Abdul Nayeem on that of the Arabian Peninsula&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Nayeem  |editor-first=Muhammed Abdul |title=Prehistory and Protohistory of the Arabian Peninsula (5 volumes) |year=1990 |publisher=Hyderabad Pub. |location=Hyderabad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chronology==
As with prehistory, determining when a culture may be considered prehistoric or protohistoric is sometimes difficult for [[archaeology|archaeologist]]s. Data vary considerably from culture to culture, region to region, and even from one system of reckoning dates to another.

In its simplest form, protohistory follows the same chronology as prehistory, based on the technological advancement of a particular people with regard to [[metallurgy]]:

*The Copper Age or [[Chalcolithic]]
*The [[Bronze Age]]
*The [[Iron Age]]

==Civilizations and peoples==
The best known protohistoric civilizations and [[ethnic group]]s  are those for whom the term was originally coined: the [[barbarian]] tribes mentioned by European and Asian writers. Many of these peoples of course also experienced periods of prehistory and history.

The '''Renaissance''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|r|ᵻ|ˈ|n|eɪ|s|ən|s}}, {{IPAc-en|US|r|ɛ|n|ə|ˈ|s|ɑː|n|s}})&lt;ref&gt;{{IPA-fr|ʁənɛsɑ̃s}}, from {{lang-fr|Renaissance}} "re-birth", {{lang-it|Rinascimento}} {{IPA-it|rinaʃʃiˈmento|}}, from ''rinascere'' "to be reborn" {{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=renaissance&amp;searchmode=none |title=Online Etymology Dictionary: "Renaissance" |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=July 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[periodization|period]] in [[History of Europe|European history]], covering the span between the 14th and 17th centuries. It is an extension of the [[Middle Ages]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bdIBlQXSKi8C&amp;pg=PA63&amp;dq=renaissance+as+extension+of+middle+ages#v=onepage&amp;q=renaissance%20as%20extension%20of%20middle%20ages&amp;f=false|title=Forever Young: A Cultural History of Longevity|isbn=9781861891549|last1=Boia|first1=Lucian|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is bridged by the [[Age of Enlightenment]] to [[modern history]]. It grew in fragments, with the very first traces found seemingly in [[Italy]], coming to cover much of Europe, for some scholars marking the beginning of the [[modern age]].

The intellectual basis of the Renaissance was its own invented version of [[Renaissance humanism|humanism]], derived from the concept of Roman [[Humanitas]] and the rediscovery of classical Greek philosophy, such as that of [[Protagoras]], who said that "Man is the measure of all things." This new thinking became manifest in art, architecture, politics, science and literature. Early examples were the development of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] in [[oil painting]] and the recycled knowledge of how to make [[concrete]]. Although the invention of [[Movable type#Metal movable type in Europe|metal movable type]] sped the dissemination of ideas from the later 15th century, the changes of the Renaissance were not uniformly experienced across Europe: the very first traces appear in Italy as early as the late 13th century, in particular with the writings of [[Dante]] and the paintings of [[Giotto]].

As a cultural movement, the Renaissance encompassed innovative flowering of Latin and vernacular literatures, beginning with the 14th-century resurgence of learning based on classical sources, which contemporaries credited to [[Petrarch]]; the development of linear perspective and other techniques of rendering a more natural reality in [[painting]]; and gradual but widespread [[History of education|educational reform]]. In politics, the Renaissance contributed to the development of the customs and conventions of [[diplomacy]], and in science to an increased reliance on observation and [[inductive reasoning]]. Although the Renaissance saw revolutions in many intellectual pursuits, as well as social and political upheaval, it is perhaps best known for its artistic developments and the contributions of such [[polymath]]s as [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Michelangelo]], who inspired the term "Renaissance man".&lt;ref&gt;BBC Science and Nature, ''[http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/leonardo/ Leonardo da Vinci]'' Retrieved May 12, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BBC History, ''[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/michelangelo.shtml Michelangelo]'' Retrieved May 12, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The Renaissance began in [[Florence]], Italy, in the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, P., ''The European Renaissance: Centre and Peripheries'' 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Various theories have been proposed to account for its origins and characteristics, focusing on a variety of factors including the social and civic peculiarities of Florence at the time: its political structure; the patronage of its dominant family, the [[House of Medici|Medici]];&lt;ref name="strathern"&gt;Strathern, Paul ''The Medici: Godfathers of the Renaissance'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.florentine-society.ru/Medici_Chapel_Mysteries.htm Peter Barenboim, Sergey Shiyan, ''Michelangelo: Mysteries of Medici Chapel'', SLOVO, Moscow, 2006]. {{ISBN|5-85050-825-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the migration of [[Greek scholars in the Renaissance|Greek scholars]] and texts to Italy following the [[Fall of Constantinople]] to the [[Turkish people|Ottoman Turks]].&lt;ref name=Britannica1&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Renaissance'', 2008, O.Ed.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Harris&gt;Har, Michael H.

The Renaissance has a long and complex [[historiography]], and, in line with general scepticism of discrete [[periodization]]s, there has been much debate among historians reacting to the 19th-century glorification of the "Renaissance" and individual culture heroes as "Renaissance men", questioning the usefulness of ''Renaissance'' as a term and as a historical delineation.&lt;ref name = "brotton"/&gt; The [[Art history|art historian]] [[Erwin Panofsky]] observed of this resistance to the concept of "Renaissance":

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is perhaps no accident that the factuality of the [[Italian Renaissance]] has been most vigorously questioned by those who are not obliged to take a professional interest in the aesthetic aspects of civilization—historians of economic and social developments, political and religious situations, and, most particularly, natural science—but only exceptionally by students of literature and hardly ever by historians of Art.&lt;ref&gt;Panofsky, ''Renaissance and Renascences in Western Art'' 1969:38; Panofsky's chapter "'Renaissance— self-definition or self-deception?" succinctly introduces the historiographical debate, with copious footnotes to the literature.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some observers have called into question whether the Renaissance was a cultural "advance" from the Middle Ages, instead seeing it as a period of pessimism and [[nostalgia]] for [[classical antiquity]],&lt;ref name="huizinga"&gt;[[Johan Huizinga|Huizanga, Johan]], ''[[The Waning of the Middle Ages]]'' (1919, trans. 1924)&lt;/ref&gt; while social and economic historians, especially of the ''[[longue durée]]'', have instead focused on the continuity between the two eras,&lt;ref name="starn" /&gt; which are linked, as Panofsky observed, "by a thousand ties".&lt;ref&gt;Panofsky 1969:6.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--not mainstream:Indeed, some have called for an end to the use of the term, which they see as a product of [[Presentism (literary and historical analysis)|presentism]] – the use of [[history]] to validate and glorify modern ideals.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/REN/IDEA.HTM The Idea of the Renaissance]'', Richard Hooker, Washington State University Website (Retrieved on May 2) {{dead link|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

The word ''Renaissance'', literally meaning "Rebirth" in French, first appeared in English in the 1830s.&lt;ref&gt;''The [[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' cites W Dyce and C H Wilson’s ''Letter to Lord Meadowbank'' (1837): "A style possessing many points of rude resemblance with the more elegant and refined character of the art of the renaissance in Italy." And the following year in ''Civil Engineer &amp; Architect’s Journal'': "Not that we consider the style of the Renaissance to be either pure or good per se." See Oxford English Dictionary, "Renaissance"&lt;/ref&gt; The word also occurs in [[Jules Michelet]]'s 1855 work, ''Histoire de France''. The word ''Renaissance'' has also been extended to other historical and cultural movements, such as the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] and the [[Renaissance of the 12th century]].&lt;ref name=mur /&gt;

==Overview==
The Renaissance was a cultural movement that profoundly affected European intellectual life in the [[early modern period]]. Beginning in Italy, and spreading to the rest of Europe by the 16th century, its influence was felt in literature, philosophy, art, music, politics, science, religion, and other aspects of intellectual inquiry. Renaissance scholars employed the [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] method in study, and searched for realism and human emotion in art.&lt;ref name="perry-humanities"&gt;Perry, M. [http://college.hmco.com/humanities/perry/humanities/1e/students/summaries/ch13.html Humanities in the Western Tradition], Ch. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Renaissance humanist]]s such as [[Poggio Bracciolini]] sought out in Europe's monastic libraries the Latin literary, historical, and oratorical texts of [[Classical Antiquity|Antiquity]], while the [[Fall of Constantinople]] (1453) generated a wave of émigré Greek scholars bringing precious manuscripts in [[ancient Greek]], many of which had fallen into obscurity in the West. It is in their new focus on literary and historical texts that Renaissance scholars differed so markedly from the medieval scholars of the [[Renaissance of the 12th century]], who had focused on studying [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Arabic]] works of natural sciences, philosophy and mathematics, rather than on such cultural texts.

In the revival of [[neo-Platonism]] Renaissance humanists did not reject [[Christianity]]; quite the contrary, many of the Renaissance's greatest works were devoted to it, and the Church patronized many works of Renaissance art. However, a subtle shift took place in the way that intellectuals approached religion that was reflected in many other areas of cultural life.&lt;ref name="openuni"&gt;Open University, ''[http://www.open.ac.uk/Arts/renaissance2/religion.htm Looking at the Renaissance: Religious Context in the Renaissance]'' (Retrieved May 10, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, many Greek Christian works, including the Greek New Testament, were brought back from Byzantium to Western Europe and engaged Western scholars for the first time since late antiquity. This new engagement with Greek Christian works, and particularly the return to the original Greek of the New Testament promoted by humanists [[Lorenzo Valla]] and [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus]], would help pave the way for the [[Protestant Reformation]].

Well after the first artistic return to classicism had been exemplified in the sculpture of [[Nicola Pisano]], Florentine painters led by [[Masaccio]] strove to portray the human form realistically, developing techniques to render [[Linear perspective|perspective]] and light more naturally. [[Political philosophy|Political philosophers]], most famously [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], sought to describe political life as it really was, that is to understand it rationally. A critical contribution to Italian Renaissance humanism [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola]] wrote the famous text ''"De hominis dignitate"'' ([[Oration on the Dignity of Man]], 1486), which consists of a series of theses on philosophy, natural thought, faith and magic defended against any opponent on the grounds of reason. In addition to studying classical Latin and Greek, Renaissance authors also began increasingly to use [[vernacular]] languages; combined with the introduction of [[Movable type|printing]], this would allow many more people access to books, especially the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Open University, [http://www.open.ac.uk/Arts/renaissance2/economic.htm#urban ''Looking at the Renaissance: Urban economy and government''] (Retrieved May 15, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

In all, the Renaissance could be viewed as an attempt by intellectuals to study and improve the [[secular]] and worldly, both through the revival of ideas from antiquity, and through novel approaches to thought. Some scholars, such as [[Rodney Stark]],&lt;ref&gt;Stark, Rodney, ''The Victory of Reason'', Random House, NY: 2005&lt;/ref&gt; play down the Renaissance in favor of the earlier innovations of the [[Italian city-states]] in the [[High Middle Ages]], which married responsive government, Christianity and the birth of [[capitalism]]. This analysis argues that, whereas the great European states (France and Spain) were absolutist monarchies, and others were under direct Church control, the independent city republics of Italy took over the principles of capitalism invented on monastic estates and set off a vast unprecedented commercial revolution that preceded and financed the Renaissance.

==Origins==
{{main|Italian Renaissance}}
[[File:Sunset over florence 1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|View of [[Florence]], birthplace of the Renaissance]]

Many argue that the ideas characterizing the Renaissance had their origin in late 13th-century [[Florence]], in particular with the writings of [[Dante Alighieri]] (1265–1321) and [[Petrarch]] (1304–1374), as well as the paintings of [[Giotto di Bondone]] (1267–1337). Some writers date the Renaissance quite precisely; one proposed starting point is 1401, when the rival geniuses [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]] and [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] competed for the contract to build the bronze doors for the Baptistery of the [[Florence Cathedral]] (Ghiberti won).&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Paul Robert, ''The Feud that sparked the Renaissance: How Brunelleschi and Ghiberti Changed the Art World'' (New York, Perennial-Harper Collins, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Others see more general competition between artists and polymaths such as Brunelleschi, Ghiberti, [[Donatello]], and [[Masaccio]] for artistic commissions as sparking the creativity of the Renaissance. Yet it remains much debated why the Renaissance began in Italy, and why it began when it did. Accordingly, several theories have been put forward to explain its origins.

During the Renaissance, money and art went hand in hand. Artists depended entirely on patrons while the patrons needed money to foster artistic talent. Wealth was brought to Italy in the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries by expanding trade into Asia and Europe. Silver mining in [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]] increased the flow of money. Luxuries from the Eastern world, brought home during the [[Crusades]], increased the prosperity of Genoa and Venice.&lt;ref name="National Geographic Society"&gt;{{cite book | last = Severy | first = Merle |author2=Thomas B Allen |author3=Ross Bennett |author4=Jules B Billard |author5=Russell Bourne |author6=Edward Lanoutte |author7=David F Robinson |author8=Verla Lee Smith | title = The Renaissance – Maker of Modern Man| publisher = National Geographic Society| year = 1970| isbn = 978-0-87044-091-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jules Michelet]] defined the 16th-century Renaissance in France as a period in Europe's cultural history that represented a break from the Middle Ages, creating a modern understanding of humanity and its place in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brotton|first=Jerry|title=The Renaissance Bazaar|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latin and Greek phases of Renaissance humanism===
{{see also|Transmission of the Greek Classics}}
{{too few opinions|date=June 2015}}&lt;!--Needs some mention of Arabic scholars, such as Averroes' commentary of Aristotle and Plato; it is well known that Copernicus took ideas from uncited (not necessarily for POV reasons) Arabic scholars--&gt;
[[File:Salutati.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Coluccio Salutati]]]]

In stark contrast to the [[High Middle Ages]], when Latin scholars focused almost entirely on studying Greek and Arabic works of natural science, philosophy and mathematics,&lt;ref&gt;For information on this earlier, very different approach to a different set of ancient texts (scientific texts rather than cultural texts) see [[Latin translations of the 12th century]], and [[Islamic contributions to Medieval Europe]].&lt;/ref&gt; Renaissance scholars were most interested in recovering and studying Latin and Greek literary, historical, and oratorical texts. Broadly speaking, this began in the 14th century with a Latin phase, when Renaissance scholars such as [[Petrarch]], [[Coluccio Salutati]] (1331–1406), [[Niccolò de' Niccoli]] (1364–1437) and [[Poggio Bracciolini]] (1380–1459) scoured the libraries of Europe in search of works by such Latin authors as [[Cicero]], [[Lucretius]], [[Livy]] and [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]].&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds and Wilson, pp. 113–123.&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 15th century, the bulk of the surviving such Latin literature had been recovered; the Greek phase of Renaissance humanism was under way, as Western European scholars turned to recovering ancient Greek literary, historical, oratorical and theological texts.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds and Wilson, pp. 123, 130–137.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike with Latin texts, which had been preserved and studied in Western Europe since late antiquity, the study of ancient Greek texts was very limited in medieval Western Europe. Ancient Greek works on science, maths and philosophy had been studied since the [[High Middle Ages]] in Western Europe and in the medieval Islamic world (normally in translation), but Greek literary, oratorical and historical works (such as Homer, the Greek dramatists, [[Demosthenes]] and [[Thucydides]]) were not studied in either the Latin or medieval Islamic worlds; in the Middle Ages these sorts of texts were only studied by Byzantine scholars. One of the greatest achievements of Renaissance scholars was to bring this entire class of Greek cultural works back into Western Europe for the first time since late antiquity. Arab logicians had inherited Greek ideas after they had invaded and conquered [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Egypt]] and the [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|Levant]]. Their translations and commentaries on these ideas worked their way through the Arab West into [[Al-Andalus|Iberia]] and [[Emirate of Sicily|Sicily]], which became important centers for this transmission of ideas. From the 11th to the 13th century, many schools dedicated to the translation of philosophical and scientific works from [[Classical Arabic]] to [[Medieval Latin]] were established in Iberia. Most notably the [[Toledo School of Translators]]. This work of translation from Islamic culture, though largely unplanned and disorganized, constituted one of the greatest transmissions of ideas in history.&lt;ref name="MP"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kKGgoNo4un0C&amp;pg=PA261&amp;lpg=PA261 ''Western Civilization: Ideas, Politics, and Society''], Marvin Perry, Myrna Chase, Margaret C. Jacob, James R. Jacob, 2008, 903 pages, p.261/262.&lt;/ref&gt; This movement to reintegrate the regular study of Greek literary, historical, oratorical and theological texts back into the Western European curriculum is usually dated to the 1396 invitation from Coluccio Salutati to the Byzantine diplomat and scholar [[Manuel Chrysoloras]] (c.1355–1415) to teach Greek in Florence.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds and Wilson, pp. 119, 131.&lt;/ref&gt; This legacy was continued by a number of expatriate Greek scholars, from [[Basilios Bessarion]] to [[Leo Allatius]].

===Social and political structures in Italy===
[[File:Italy 1494 AD.png|thumb|A political map of the Italian [[Peninsula]] circa 1494]]

The unique political structures of late [[Middle Ages]] [[Italy]] have led some to theorize that its unusual social climate allowed the emergence of a rare cultural efflorescence. Italy did not exist as a [[Nation-state|political entity]] in the early modern period. Instead, it was divided into smaller [[Italian city-states|city states]] and territories: the [[Kingdom of Naples]] controlled the south, the [[Republic of Florence]] and the [[Papal States]] at the center, the [[Milan]]ese and the [[Genoa|Genoese]] to the north and west respectively, and the [[Venice|Venetians]] to the east. Fifteenth-century Italy was one of the most [[urbanization|urbanised]] areas in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Kirshner, Julius, ''Family and Marriage: A socio-legal perspective'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=x9grA0fWpDMC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;lpg=PA89&amp;dq=italy+urban+population+15th+century&amp;sig=7QjemnDKllytG-1qNFygZFmlUD0 ''Italy in the Age of the Renaissance: 1300–1550''], ed. John M. Najemy (Oxford University Press, 2004) p.89 (Retrieved on May 10, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Many of its cities stood among the ruins of ancient Roman buildings; it seems likely that the classical nature of the Renaissance was linked to its origin in the Roman Empire's heartland.&lt;ref&gt;Burckhardt, Jacob, ''The Revival of Antiquity', [http://www.boisestate.edu/courses/hy309/docs/burckhardt/3-2.html ''The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407181825/http://www.boisestate.edu/courses/hy309/docs/burckhardt/3-2.html |date=April 7, 2007 }}'' (trans. by S.G.C. Middlemore, 1878)&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian and political philosopher [[Quentin Skinner]] points out that [[Otto of Freising]] (c. 1114–1158), a German bishop visiting north Italy during the 12th century, noticed a widespread new form of political and social organization, observing that Italy appeared to have exited from Feudalism so that its society was based on merchants and commerce. Linked to this was anti-monarchical thinking, represented in the famous early Renaissance fresco cycle ''Allegory of Good and Bad Government in Siena'' by [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti]] (painted 1338–1340), whose strong message is about the virtues of fairness, justice, republicanism and good administration. Holding both Church and Empire at bay, these city republics were devoted to notions of liberty. Skinner reports that there were many defences of liberty such as the [[Matteo Palmieri]] (1406–1475) celebration of Florentine genius not only in art, sculpture and architecture, but "the remarkable efflorescence of moral, social and political philosophy that occurred in Florence at the same time".&lt;ref name="Skinner, Quentin p. 69"&gt;Skinner, Quentin, ''The Foundations of Modern Political Thought'', vol I: ''The Renaissance''; vol II: ''The Age of Reformation'', Cambridge University Press, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

Even cities and states beyond central Italy, such as the [[Republic of Florence]] at this time, were also notable for their merchant [[Republics]], especially the [[Republic of Venice]]. Although in practice these were [[oligarchy|oligarchical]], and bore little resemblance to a modern [[democracy]], they did have democratic features and were responsive states, with forms of participation in governance and belief in liberty.&lt;ref name="Skinner, Quentin p. 69"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stark, Rodney, ''The Victory of Reason'', New York, Random House, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin, J. and Romano, D., ''Venice Reconsidered'', Baltimore, Johns Hopkins University, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The relative political freedom they afforded was conducive to academic and artistic advancement.&lt;ref name="burckhardt-republics"&gt;Burckhardt, Jacob, ''The Republics: Venice and Florence'', ''[http://www.boisestate.edu/courses/hy309/docs/burckhardt/1-7.html The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407035616/http://www.boisestate.edu/courses/hy309/docs/burckhardt/1-7.html |date=April 7, 2007 }}'', translated by S.G.C. Middlemore, 1878.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the position of Italian cities such as Venice as great trading centres made them intellectual crossroads. [[Merchants]] brought with them ideas from far corners of the globe, particularly the [[Levant]]. Venice was Europe's gateway to trade with the East, and a producer of fine [[Venetian glass|glass]], while Florence was a capital of textiles. The wealth such business brought to Italy meant large public and private artistic projects could be commissioned and individuals had more leisure time for study.&lt;ref name="burckhardt-republics" /&gt;

===Black Plague===
One theory that has been advanced is that the devastation in [[Florence]] caused by the [[Black Death]], which hit [[Europe]] between 1348 and 1350, resulted in a shift in the world view of people in 14th-century Italy. Italy was particularly badly hit by the plague, and it has been speculated that the resulting familiarity with death caused thinkers to dwell more on their lives on Earth, rather than on [[spirituality]] and the [[afterlife]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Barbara Tuchman]] (1978) ''A Distant Mirror'', Knopf {{ISBN|0-394-40026-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been argued that the Black Death prompted a new wave of piety, manifested in the [[Patron#Arts|sponsorship]] of religious works of art.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/endmiddle/bluedot/blackdeath.html The End of Europe's Middle Ages: The Black Death] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309162102/http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/endmiddle/bluedot/blackdeath.html |date=March 9, 2013 }} University of Calgary website. (Retrieved on April 5, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; However, this does not fully explain why the Renaissance occurred specifically in Italy in the 14th century. The Black Death was a pandemic that affected all of Europe in the ways described, not only Italy. The Renaissance's emergence in Italy was most likely the result of the complex interaction of the above factors.&lt;ref name="brotton"&gt;Brotton, J., ''The Renaissance: A Very Short Introduction'', [[Oxford University Press|OUP]], 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-280163-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The plague was carried by fleas on sailing vessels returning from the ports of Asia, spreading quickly due to lack of proper sanitation: the population of England, then about 4.2 million, lost 1.4 million people to the bubonic plague. Florence's population was nearly halved in the year 1347. As a result of the decimation in the populace the value of the working class increased, and commoners came to enjoy more freedom. To answer the increased need for labor, workers traveled in search of the most favorable position economically.&lt;ref&gt;Netzley, Patricia D. ''Life During the Renaissance.''San Diego: Lucent Books, Inc., 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

The demographic decline due to the plague had economic consequences: the prices of food dropped and land values declined by 30 to 40% in most parts of Europe between 1350 and 1400.&lt;ref&gt;Hause, S. &amp; Maltby, W. (2001). ''A History of European Society. Essentials of Western Civilization'' (Vol. 2, p. 217). Belmont, CA: Thomson Learning, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Landholders faced a great loss, but for ordinary men and women it was a windfall. The survivors of the plague found not only that the prices of food were cheaper but also that lands were more abundant, and many of them inherited property from their dead relatives.

The spread of disease was significantly more rampant in areas of poverty. [[Epidemic]]s ravaged cities, particularly children. Plagues were easily spread by lice, unsanitary drinking water, armies, or by poor sanitation. Children were hit the hardest because many diseases, such as typhus and syphilis, target the immune system, leaving young children without a fighting chance. Children in city dwellings were more affected by the spread of disease than the children of the wealthy.&lt;ref&gt;"Renaissance And Reformation France" Mack P. Holt pg.30,39,69,166&lt;/ref&gt;

The Black Death caused greater upheaval to Florence's social and political structure than later epidemics. Despite a significant number of deaths among members of the ruling classes, the government of Florence continued to function during this period. Formal meetings of elected representatives were suspended during the height of the epidemic due to the chaotic conditions in the city, but a small group of officials was appointed to conduct the affairs of the city, which ensured continuity of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hatty|first=Suzanne|title=Disordered Body: Epidemic Disease and Cultural Transformation|work=ebscohost|location=State University of New York|page=89|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural conditions in Florence===
[[File:Lorenzo de' Medici Rubens.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lorenzo de' Medici]], ruler of [[Florence]] and patron of arts (Portrait by [[Rubens]])]]

It has long been a matter of debate why the Renaissance began in [[Florence]], and not elsewhere in Italy. Scholars have noted several features unique to Florentine cultural life that may have caused such a cultural movement. Many have emphasized the role played by the [[Medici]], a [[banking|banking family]] and later [[dynasty|ducal ruling house]], in patronizing and stimulating the arts. [[Lorenzo de' Medici]] (1449–1492) was the catalyst for an enormous amount of arts patronage, encouraging his countrymen to commission works from the leading artists of Florence, including [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Sandro Botticelli]], and [[Michelangelo Buonarroti]].&lt;ref name="strathern" /&gt; Works by [[Neri di Bicci]], Botticelli, da Vinci and [[Filippino Lippi]] had been commissioned additionally by the convent di San Donato agli Scopeti of the [[Augustinians]] order in Florence.&lt;ref&gt;Guido Carocci, I dintorni di Firenze, Vol. II, Galletti e Cocci, Firenze, 1907, pagg. 336-337&lt;/ref&gt;

The Renaissance was certainly underway before Lorenzo de' Medici came to power – indeed, before the Medici family itself achieved hegemony in Florentine society. Some historians have postulated that Florence was the birthplace of the Renaissance as a result of luck, i.e. because "[[Great man theory|Great Men]]" were born there by chance:&lt;ref name="burckhardt-individual"&gt;Burckhardt, Jacob, ''The Development of the Individual'', ''[http://www.boisestate.edu/courses/hy309/docs/burckhardt/2-1.html The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003000844/http://www.boisestate.edu/courses/hy309/docs/burckhardt/2-1.html |date=October 3, 2008 }}'', translated by S.G.C. Middlemore, 1878.&lt;/ref&gt; Leonardo da Vinci, Botticelli and Michelangelo were all born in [[Tuscany]]. Arguing that such chance seems improbable, other historians have contended that these "Great Men" were only able to rise to prominence because of the prevailing cultural conditions at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, J., ''Individualism and the cult of creative personality'', ''The Italian Renaissance'', New York, 1990 p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

===Humanism===
{{Main|Renaissance humanism}}
[[File:Pico1.jpg|thumb|[[Pico della Mirandola]] wrote the famous ''[[Oration on the Dignity of Man]]'', which has been called the "Manifesto of the Renaissance".&lt;ref&gt;''Oration on the Dignity of Man'' (1486) [http://www.wsu.edu:8080/~wldciv/world_civ_reader/world_civ_reader_1/pico.html wsu.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104024142/http://www.wsu.edu:8080/~wldciv/world_civ_reader/world_civ_reader_1/pico.html |date=January 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In some ways [[Renaissance humanism|humanism]] was not a philosophy but a method of learning. In contrast to the medieval [[scholasticism|scholastic]] mode, which focused on resolving contradictions between authors, humanists would study ancient texts in the original and appraise them through a combination of reasoning and [[empirical evidence]]. Humanist education was based on the programme of 'Studia Humanitatis', the study of five humanities: [[poetry]], [[grammar]], [[history]], [[moral philosophy]] and [[rhetoric]]. Although historians have sometimes struggled to define humanism precisely, most have settled on "a middle of the road definition... the movement to recover, interpret, and assimilate the language, literature, learning and values of ancient Greece and Rome".&lt;ref&gt;Burke, P., "The spread of Italian humanism", in ''The Impact of Humanism on Western Europe'', ed. A. Goodman and A. MacKay, London, 1990, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Above all, humanists asserted "the genius of man&amp;nbsp;... the unique and extraordinary ability of the human mind".&lt;ref&gt;As asserted by Gianozzo Manetti in ''On the Dignity and Excellence of Man'', cited in Clare, J., ''Italian Renaissance''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Humanist scholars shaped the intellectual landscape throughout the early modern period. Political philosophers such as [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] and [[Thomas More]] revived the ideas of Greek and Roman thinkers and applied them in critiques of contemporary government. [[Pico della Mirandola]] wrote the "manifesto" of the Renaissance, the ''[[Oration on the Dignity of Man]]'', a vibrant defence of thinking. [[Matteo Palmieri]] (1406–1475), another humanist, is most known for his work ''Della vita civile'' ("On Civic Life"; printed 1528), which advocated [[Classical republicanism|civic humanism]], and for his influence in refining the [[Tuscan language|Tuscan vernacular]] to the same level as Latin. Palmieri drew on Roman philosophers and theorists, especially [[Cicero]], who, like Palmieri, lived an active public life as a citizen and official, as well as a theorist and philosopher and also [[Quintilian]]. Perhaps the most succinct expression of his perspective on humanism is in a 1465 poetic work ''La città di vita'', but an earlier work, ''Della vita civile'' (On Civic Life), is more wide-ranging. Composed as a series of dialogues set in a country house in the Mugello countryside outside Florence during the plague of 1430, Palmieri expounds on the qualities of the ideal citizen. The dialogues include ideas about how children develop mentally and physically, how citizens can conduct themselves morally, how citizens and states can ensure probity in public life, and an important debate on the difference between that which is pragmatically useful and that which is honest.

The humanists believed that it is important to transcend to the afterlife with a perfect mind and body, which could be attained with education. The purpose of humanism was to create a universal man whose person combined intellectual and physical excellence and who was capable of functioning honorably in virtually any situation.&lt;ref&gt;Hause, S. &amp; Maltby, W. (2001). ''A History of European Society. Essentials of Western Civilization'' (Vol. 2, pp. 245–246). Belmont, CA: Thomson Learning, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; This ideology was referred to as the ''[[Polymath|uomo universale]]'', an ancient Greco-Roman ideal. Education during the Renaissance was mainly composed of ancient literature and history as it was thought that the classics provided moral instruction and an intensive understanding of human behavior.

===Humanism and Libraries===
A unique characteristic of some Renaissance libraries is that they were open to the public. These libraries were places where ideas were exchanged and where scholarship and reading were considered both pleasurable and beneficial to the mind and soul. As freethinking was a hallmark of the age, many libraries contained a wide range of writers. Classical texts could be found alongside humanist writings. These informal associations of intellectuals profoundly influenced Renaissance culture. Some of the richest "bibliophiles" built libraries as temples to books and knowledge. A number of libraries appeared as manifestations of immense wealth joined with a love of books. In some cases, cultivated library builders were also committed to offering others the opportunity to use their collections. Prominent aristocrats and princes of the Church created great libraries for the use of their courts, called "court libraries", and were housed in lavishly designed monumental buildings decorated with ornate woodwork, and the walls adorned with frescoes (Murray, Stuart A.P.)

===Art===

{{see also|Islamic influences on Western art}}
[[File:Michelangelo's grave4.jpg|thumb|The tomb of [[Michelangelo]] in the [[Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence]]]]

Renaissance art marks a cultural rebirth at the close of the Middle Ages and rise of the Modern world. One of the distinguishing features of Renaissance art was its development of highly realistic linear perspective. [[Giotto|Giotto di Bondone]] (1267–1337) is credited with first treating a painting as a window into space, but it was not until the demonstrations of architect [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] (1377–1446) and the subsequent writings of [[Leon Battista Alberti]] (1404–1472) that perspective was formalized as an artistic technique.&lt;ref&gt;Clare, John D. &amp; Millen, Alan, ''Italian Renaissance'', London, 1994, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of perspective was part of a wider trend towards [[Realism (arts)|realism]] in the arts.&lt;ref&gt;Stork, David G. ''[http://sirl.stanford.edu/~bob/teaching/pdf/arth202/Stork_SciAm04.pdf Optics and Realism in Renaissance Art] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614023308/http://sirl.stanford.edu/~bob/teaching/pdf/arth202/Stork_SciAm04.pdf |date=June 14, 2007 }}'' (Retrieved May 10, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Painters developed other techniques, studying light, shadow, and, famously in the case of [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[human anatomy]]. Underlying these changes in artistic method was a renewed desire to depict the beauty of nature and to unravel the axioms of [[aesthetics]], with the works of Leonardo, [[Michelangelo]] and [[Raphael]] representing artistic pinnacles that were much imitated by other artists.&lt;ref&gt;Vasari, Giorgio, ''Lives of the Artists'', translated by George Bull, Penguin Classics, 1965, {{ISBN|0-14-044164-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable artists include [[Sandro Botticelli]], working for the Medici in Florence, [[Donatello]], another Florentine, and [[Titian]] in Venice, among others.

[[File:Da Vinci Vitruve Luc Viatour.jpg|thumb|left|[[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[Vitruvian Man]]'' (c. 1490) demonstrates the effect writers of Antiquity had on Renaissance thinkers. Based on the specifications in [[Vitruvius]]' ''[[De architectura]]'' (1st century BC), Leonardo tried to draw the perfectly proportioned man. (Museum [[Gallerie dell'Accademia]], [[Venice]])]]

In the [[Netherlands]], a particularly vibrant artistic culture developed. The work of [[Hugo van der Goes]] and [[Jan van Eyck]] was particularly influential on the development of painting in Italy, both technically with the introduction of [[oil paint]] and canvas, and stylistically in terms of naturalism in representation (see ''[[Renaissance in the Netherlands]]''). Later, the work of [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]] would inspire artists to depict themes of everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/bio/b/bruegel/pieter_e/biograph.html Peter Brueghel Biography]'', Web Gallery of Art (Retrieved May 10, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

In architecture, [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] was foremost in studying the remains of ancient classical buildings. With rediscovered knowledge from the 1st-century writer [[Vitruvius]] and the flourishing discipline of [[mathematics]], Brunelleschi formulated the Renaissance style that emulated and improved on classical forms. His major feat of engineering was building the dome of the [[Duomo of Florence|Florence Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;Hooker, Richard, ''[http://www.cartage.org.lb/en/themes/arts/Architec/RenaissanceArchitecture/ArchitectureandPublicSpace/ArchitectureandPublicSpace.htm Architecture and Public Space] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070522160730/http://www.cartage.org.lb/en/themes/arts/Architec/RenaissanceArchitecture/ArchitectureandPublicSpace/ArchitectureandPublicSpace.htm |date=May 22, 2007 }}'' (Retrieved May 10, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Another building demonstrating this style is the church of St. Andrew in [[Mantua]], built by Alberti. The outstanding architectural work of the High Renaissance was the rebuilding of [[St. Peter's Basilica]], combining the skills of [[Bramante]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Raphael]], [[Antonio da Sangallo the Younger|Sangallo]] and [[Carlo Maderno|Maderno]].

During the Renaissance, architects aimed to use columns, pilasters, and [[entablatures]] as an integrated system. The Roman orders types of columns are used: Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian and Composite. These can either be structural, supporting an arcade or architrave, or purely decorative, set against a wall in the form of [[pilasters]]. One of the first buildings to use pilasters as an integrated system was in the Old Sacristy (1421–1440) by Brunelleschi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Filippo Brunelleschi: The Buildings|last=Saalman|first=Howard|publisher=Zwemmer|year=1993|isbn=978-0-271-01067-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arches, semi-circular or (in the [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] style) segmental, are often used in arcades, supported on piers or columns with capitals. There may be a section of entablature between the capital and the springing of the arch. Alberti was one of the first to use the arch on a monumental. Renaissance vaults do not have ribs; they are semi-circular or segmental and on a square plan, unlike the [[Gothic style|Gothic]] vault, which is frequently rectangular.

Renaissance artists were not pagans, although they admired antiquity and kept some ideas and symbols of the medieval past. [[Nicola Pisano]] (c. 1220–c. 1278) imitated classical forms by portraying scenes from the Bible. His ''Annunciation'', from the [[Pisa Baptistry|Baptistry at Pisa]], demonstrates that classical models influenced Italian art before the Renaissance took root as a literary movement &lt;ref&gt;Hause, S. &amp; Maltby, W.

The rediscovery of ancient texts and the invention of [[printing]] democratized learning and allowed a faster propagation of more widely distributed ideas. In the first period of the [[Italian Renaissance]], humanists favoured the study of [[humanities]] over [[natural philosophy]] or [[applied mathematics]], and their reverence for classical sources further enshrined the [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] and [[Ptolemy|Ptolemaic]] views of the universe. Writing around 1450, [[Nicholas of Cusa|Nicholas Cusanus]] anticipated the [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] worldview of [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]], but in a philosophical fashion.

Science and art were intermingled in the early Renaissance, with [[polymath]] artists such as Leonardo da Vinci making observational drawings of anatomy and nature. Da Vinci set up controlled experiments in water flow, medical dissection, and systematic study of movement and aerodynamics, and he devised principles of research method that led Fritjof Capra to classify him as the "father of modern science".&lt;ref&gt;Capra, Fritjof, ''The Science of Leonardo; Inside the Mind of the Great Genius of the Renaissance'', New York, Doubleday, 2007. Exhaustive 2007 study by Fritjof Capra shows that Leonardo was a much greater scientist than previously thought, and not just an inventor. Leonardo was innovative in science theory and in conducting actual science practice. In Capra's detailed assessment of many surviving manuscripts, Leonardo's science in tune with holistic non-mechanistic and non-reductive approaches to science, which are becoming popular today.&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of Da Vinci's contribution during this period include machines designed to saw marbles and lift monoliths and new discoveries in acoustics, botany, geology, anatomy and mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;Columbus and Vesalius—The Age of Discoverers. ''JAMA.'' 2015;313(3):312. doi:10.1001/jama.2014.11534&lt;/ref&gt;

A suitable environment had developed to question scientific doctrine. The [[Age of Discovery|discovery]] in 1492 of the [[New World]] by [[Christopher Columbus]] challenged the classical worldview. The works of [[Ptolemy]] (in geography) and [[Galen]] (in medicine) were found to not always match everyday observations. As the [[Protestant Reformation]] and [[Counter-Reformation]] clashed, the [[Northern Renaissance]] showed a decisive shift in focus from Aristotelean natural philosophy to chemistry and the biological sciences (botany, anatomy, and medicine).&lt;ref&gt;[[Allen Debus]], ''Man and Nature in the Renaissance'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1978).&lt;/ref&gt; The willingness to question previously held truths and search for new answers resulted in a period of major scientific advancements.

Some view this as a "[[scientific revolution]]", heralding the beginning of the modern age,&lt;ref&gt;Butterfield, Herbert, ''The Origins of Modern Science, 1300–1800'', p. viii&lt;/ref&gt; others as an acceleration of a continuous process stretching from the ancient world to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin, Steven. ''The Scientific Revolution'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1996, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Significant scientific advances were made during this time by [[Galileo Galilei]], [[Tycho Brahe]] and [[Johannes Kepler]].&lt;ref&gt;"Scientific Revolution" in ''[[Encarta]]''. 2007. [http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_701509067/Scientific_Revolution.html.]&lt;/ref&gt; Copernicus, in ''[[De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium|De Revolutionibus]]'', posited that the Earth moved around the Sun. ''[[De humani corporis fabrica]]'' (''On the Workings of the Human Body''), by [[Andreas Vesalius]], gave a new confidence to the role of [[dissection]], observation, and the [[Mechanical philosophy|mechanistic]] view of anatomy.&lt;ref name="short-science"&gt;Brotton, J., "Science and Philosophy", ''The Renaissance: A Very Short Introduction'' [[Oxford University Press]], 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-280163-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important development was in the ''process'' for discovery, the [[scientific method]],&lt;ref name="short-science" /&gt; focusing on [[Empiricism|empirical evidence]] and the importance of [[mathematics]], while discarding Aristotelian science. Early and influential proponents of these ideas included Copernicus, Galileo, and [[Francis Bacon]].&lt;ref&gt;

Applied innovation extended to commerce. At the end of the 15th century [[Luca Pacioli]] published the first work on [[bookkeeping]], making him the founder of [[accounting]].&lt;ref name=jkdiwan&gt;{{cite book |last=DIWAN |first=Jaswith|title=ACCOUNTING CONCEPTS &amp; THEORIES|publisher=MORRE|location=LONDON|id=id# 94452|pages=001–002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Navigation and Geography===

During the Renaissance, extending from 1450 to 1650 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Woodward |first1=David |title=The History of Cartography, Volume Three: Cartography in the European Renaissance |date=2007 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago and London |isbn=9780226907338}}&lt;/ref&gt;, every Continent was visited and mostly mapped by Europeans, except the south polar continent now known as [[Antarctica]]. This development is depicted in the large world map ''Nova Totius Terrarum Orbis Tabula'' made by the Dutch cartographer [[Joan Blaeu]] in 1648 to commemorate the [[Peace of Westphalia]]. 

In 1492, Christopher Columbus sailed across the Atlantic Ocean from Spain seeking a direct route to Asia. He accidentally stumbled upon the Americas, but believed he had reached the East Indies.

In 1606, the Dutch navigator [[Willem Janszoon]] sailed from the East Indies in the [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]] ship [[Duyfken]] and landed in [[Australia]]. He charted about 300 km of the west coast of [[Cape York Peninsula]] in Queensland. More than thirty Dutch expeditions followed, mapping sections of the north, west and south coasts. In 1642-1643, [[Abel Tasman]] circumnavigated the continent, proving that it was not joined to the imagined south polar continent.

By 1650, Dutch cartographers had mapped most of the coastline of the continent, which they named [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]], except the east coast which was charted in 1770 by [[James Cook|Captain Cook]].

The long-imagined south polar continent was eventually sighted in 1820. Throughout the Renaissance it had been known as [[Terra Australis]], or 'Australia' for short. However, after that name was transferred to New Holland in the nineteenth century, the new name of 'Antarctica' was bestowed on the south polar continent. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cameron-Ash |first1=M. |title=Lying for the Admiralty: Captain Cook's Endeavour Voyage |date=2018 |publisher=Rosenberg |location=Sydney |isbn=9780648043966 |page=19-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
{{Main|Renaissance music}}

From this changing society emerged a common, unifying musical language, in particular the [[polyphony|polyphonic]] style of the [[Franco-Flemish]] school. The development of [[printing press|printing]] made distribution of music possible on a wide scale. Demand for music as entertainment and as an activity for educated amateurs increased with the emergence of a bourgeois class. Dissemination of [[chanson]]s, [[motet]]s, and [[mass (music)|masses]] throughout Europe coincided with the unification of polyphonic practice into the fluid style that culminated in the second half of the sixteenth century in the work of composers such as [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]], [[Orlande de Lassus|Lassus]], [[Tomás Luis de Victoria|Victoria]] and [[William Byrd]].

===Religion===
{{Main|Protestant Reformation|Counter-Reformation}}
[[File:Alexander VI - Pinturicchio detail.jpg|thumb|left|[[Alexander VI]], a [[Borgia]] Pope infamous for his corruption]]

The new ideals of humanism, although more secular in some aspects, developed against a [[Christian]] backdrop, especially in the [[Northern Renaissance]]. Much, if not most, of the new art was commissioned by or in dedication to the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]].&lt;ref name="openuni" /&gt; However, the Renaissance had a profound effect on contemporary [[theology]], particularly in the way people perceived the relationship between man and God.&lt;ref name="openuni" /&gt; Many of the period's foremost theologians were followers of the humanist method, including [[Erasmus]], [[Zwingli]], [[Thomas More]], [[Martin Luther]], and [[John Calvin]].

[[File:Clovio magi.jpg|thumb|''[[Adoration of the Magi]]'' and ''[[Solomon]] adored by the [[Queen of Sheba]]'' from the ''[[Farnese Hours]]'' (1546) by [[Giulio Clovio]] marks [[Italian Renaissance#Renaissance end|the end of the Italian Renaissance]] of [[illuminated manuscript]] together with the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]''.]]

The Renaissance began in times of religious turmoil. The late [[Middle Ages]] was a period of political intrigue surrounding the [[Papacy]], culminating in the [[Western Schism]], in which three men simultaneously claimed to be true [[Bishop]] of [[diocese of Rome|Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Catholic Encyclopedia]], ''[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13539a.htm Western Schism]'' (Retrieved May 10, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; While the schism was resolved by the [[Council of Constance]] (1414), a resulting reform movement known as [[Conciliarism]] sought to limit the power of the pope. Although the papacy eventually emerged supreme in ecclesiastical matters by the [[Fifth Council of the Lateran]] (1511), it was dogged by continued accusations of corruption, most famously in the person of [[Pope Alexander VI]], who was accused variously of [[simony]], [[nepotism]] and fathering four children (most of whom were married off, presumably for the consolidation of power) while a cardinal.&lt;ref&gt;[[Catholic Encyclopedia]], ''[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01289a.htm Alexander VI]'' (Retrieved May 10, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Churchmen such as Erasmus and Luther proposed reform to the Church, often based on humanist [[textual criticism]] of the [[New Testament]].&lt;ref name="openuni" /&gt; In October 1517 Luther published the [[95 Theses]], challenging papal authority and criticizing its perceived corruption, particularly with regard to instances of sold [[indulgences]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;It is sometimes thought that the Church, as an institution, formally sold indulgences at the time. This, however, was not the practice. Donations were often received, but only mandated by individuals that were condemned. (See [[Indulgence]].)&lt;/ref&gt; The 95 Theses led to the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], a break with the Roman Catholic Church that previously claimed hegemony in [[Western Europe]]. Humanism and the Renaissance therefore played a direct role in sparking the Reformation, as well as in many other contemporaneous religious debates and conflicts.

[[Pope Paul III]] came to the papal throne (1534–1549) after the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|sack of Rome in 1527]], with uncertainties prevalent in the Catholic Church following the Protestant Reformation. Nicolaus Copernicus dedicated ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' (On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres) to Paul III, who became the grandfather of [[Alessandro Farnese (cardinal)]], who had paintings by [[Titian]], [[Michelangelo]], and [[Raphael]], as well as an important collection of drawings, and who commissioned the masterpiece of [[Giulio Clovio]], arguably the last major [[illuminated manuscript]], the ''[[Farnese Hours]]''.

===Self-awareness===
[[File:Leonardo Bruni - Imagines philologorum.jpg|alt=|thumb|[[Leonardo Bruni]]]]
By the 15th century, writers, artists, and architects in Italy were well aware of the transformations that were taking place and were using phrases such as ''modi antichi'' (in the antique manner) or ''alle romana et alla antica'' (in the manner of the Romans and the ancients) to describe their work. In the 1330s [[Petrarch]] referred to pre-Christian times as ''antiqua'' (ancient) and to the Christian period as ''nova'' (new).&lt;ref name=mommsen&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mommsen | first = Theodore E.|authorlink =Theodor Ernst Mommsen |title = Petrarch's Conception of the 'Dark Ages' | journal = [[Speculum (journal)|Speculum]] | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | pages = 226–242 | year = 1942| doi = 10.2307/2856364|jstor = 2856364 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From Petrarch's Italian perspective, this new period (which included his own time) was an age of national eclipse.&lt;ref name=mommsen/&gt;
[[Leonardo Bruni]] was the first to use tripartite [[periodization]] in his ''History of the Florentine People'' (1442).&lt;ref name="Hankins"&gt;Leonardo Bruni, James Hankins, ''History of the Florentine people'', Volume 1, Books 1–4 (2001), p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; Bruni's first two periods were based on those of Petrarch, but he added a third period because he believed that Italy was no longer in a state of decline. [[Flavio Biondo]] used a similar framework in ''Decades of History from the Deterioration of the Roman Empire'' (1439–1453).

Humanist historians argued that contemporary scholarship restored direct links to the classical period, thus bypassing the Medieval period, which they then named for the first time the "[[Middle Ages]]". The term first appears in Latin in 1469 as ''media tempestas'' (middle times).&lt;ref name="Albrow"&gt;Albrow, Martin, ''The Global Age: state and society beyond modernity'' (1997), Stanford University Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZwmdxMMjOd4C&amp;pg=PA205 p. 205] {{ISBN|0-8047-2870-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''la rinascita'' (rebirth) first appeared, however, in its broad sense in [[Giorgio Vasari]]'s ''[[Le Vite de' più eccellenti pittori, scultori, e architettori|Lives of the Artists]]'', 1550, revised 1568.&lt;ref name="panofsky"&gt;[[Erwin Panofsky|Panofsky, Erwin]]. ''Renaissance and Renascences in Western Art'', New York: Harper and Row, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Open University Guide to the Renaissance, ''[http://www.open.ac.uk/Arts/renaissance/defining.htm Defining the Renaissance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721070445/http://www.open.ac.uk/Arts/renaissance/defining.htm |date=July 21, 2009 }}'' (Retrieved May 10, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Vasari divides the age into three phases: the first phase contains [[Cimabue]], [[Giotto]], and [[Arnolfo di Cambio]]; the second phase contains [[Masaccio]], [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]], and [[Donatello]]; the third centers on [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and culminates with [[Michelangelo]]. It was not just the growing awareness of classical antiquity that drove this development, according to Vasari, but also the growing desire to study and imitate nature.&lt;ref&gt;Sohm, Philip. ''Style in the Art Theory of Early Modern Italy'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001) {{ISBN|0-521-78069-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spread==
In the 15th century, the Renaissance spread rapidly from its birthplace in Florence to the rest of Italy and soon to the rest of Europe. The invention of the [[printing press]] by German printer [[Johannes Gutenberg]] allowed the rapid transmission of these new ideas. As it spread, its ideas diversified and changed, being adapted to local culture. In the 20th century, scholars began to break the Renaissance into regional and national movements.

===England===
{{main|English Renaissance}}
[[File:Shakespeare.jpg|thumb|upright|[[William Shakespeare]]|"What a piece of work is a man, how noble in reason, how infinite in faculties, in form and moving
how express and admirable, in action how like an angel, in apprehension
how like a god!" — from [[William Shakespeare]]'s'' [[Hamlet]]''.]]

In England, the sixteenth century marked the beginning of the [[English Renaissance]] with the work of writers [[William Shakespeare]], [[Christopher Marlowe]], [[Edmund Spenser]], [[Sir Thomas More]], [[Francis Bacon]], [[Sir Philip Sidney]], as well as great artists, architects (such as [[Inigo Jones]] who introduced Italianate architecture to England), and composers such as [[Thomas Tallis]], [[John Taverner]], and [[William Byrd]].

===France===
{{main|French Renaissance}}

[[File:Chateau de chambord.jpg|thumb|left|[[Château de Chambord]] (1519–1547), one of the most famous examples of [[Renaissance architecture]]]]

The word "Renaissance" is borrowed from the French language, where it means "re-birth". It was first used in the eighteenth century and was later popularized by French [[historian]] [[Jules Michelet]] (1798–1874) in his 1855 work, ''Histoire de France'' (History of France).&lt;ref name="Michelet, Jules 1847"&gt;Michelet, Jules. ''History of France'', trans. G. H. Smith (New York: D. Appleton, 1847)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cronin2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Vincent Cronin|title=The Florentine Renaissance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aU8z-Sge6WgC|date=30 June 2011|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-4464-6654-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1495 the [[Italian Renaissance]] arrived in France, imported by King [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]] after his invasion of Italy. A factor that promoted the spread of secularism was the inability of the Church to offer assistance against the [[Black Death]]. [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] imported Italian art and artists, including [[Leonardo da Vinci]], and built ornate palaces at great expense. Writers such as [[François Rabelais]], [[Pierre de Ronsard]], [[Joachim du Bellay]] and [[Michel de Montaigne]], painters such as [[Jean Clouet]], and musicians such as [[Jean Mouton]] also borrowed from the spirit of the Renaissance.

In 1533, a fourteen-year-old [[Catherine de' Medici|Caterina de' Medici]] (1519–1589), born in Florence to Lorenzo II de' Medici and Madeleine de la Tour d'Auvergne, married [[Henry II of France]], second son of King Francis I and Queen Claude. Though she became famous and infamous for her role in France's religious wars, she made a direct contribution in bringing arts, sciences and music (including the origins of [[ballet]]) to the French court from her native Florence.

===Germany===
{{main|German Renaissance}}
[[File:Jan van Eyck 001.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[The Arnolfini Portrait]]'', by [[Jan van Eyck]], 1434]]

In the second half of the 15th century, the Renaissance spirit spread to [[Germany]] and the [[Low Countries]], where the development of the printing press (ca. 1450) and early Renaissance artists such as the painters [[Jan van Eyck]] (1395–1441) and [[Hieronymus Bosch]] (1450–1516) and the composers [[Johannes Ockeghem]] (1410–1497), [[Jacob Obrecht]] (1457–1505) and [[Josquin des Prez]] (1455–1521) predated the influence from Italy. In the early Protestant areas of the country [[humanism]] became closely linked to the turmoil of the Protestant Reformation, and the art and writing of the [[German Renaissance]] frequently reflected this dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=560776|year=1965|title=The Religious Renaissance of the German Humanists |author=Strauss, Gerald|journal=English Historical Review|volume=80|issue=314|pages=156–157}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the gothic style and medieval scholastic philosophy remained exclusively until the turn of the 16th century. Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] of [[Habsburg]] (ruling 1493–1519) was the first truly Renaissance monarch of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

===Hungary===
After Italy, Hungary was the first European country where the Renaissance appeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|author1=Peter Farbaky |author2=Louis A. Waldman }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Renaissance style came directly from Italy during the [[Quattrocento]] to Hungary first in the Central European region, thanks to the development of early Hungarian-Italian relationships – not only in dynastic connections, but also in cultural, humanistic and commercial relations – growing in strength from the 14th century. The relationship between Hungarian and Italian Gothic styles was a second reason – exaggerated breakthrough of walls is avoided, preferring clean and light structures. Large-scale building schemes provided ample and long term work for the artists, for example, the building of the Friss (New) Castle in Buda, the castles of Visegrád, Tata and Várpalota. In Sigismund's court there were patrons such as Pipo Spano, a descendant of the Scolari family of Florence, who invited Manetto Ammanatini and Masolino da Pannicale to Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;Title: Hungary (4th edition)Authors: Zoltán Halász / András Balla (photo) / Zsuzsa Béres (translation) Published by Corvina, in 1998 {{ISBN|963-13-4129-1}}, 963-13-4727-3&lt;/ref&gt;

The new Italian trend combined with existing national traditions to create a particular local Renaissance art. Acceptance of Renaissance art was furthered by the continuous arrival of humanist thought in the country. Many young Hungarians studying at Italian universities came closer to the [[Florence|Florentine]] humanist center, so a direct connection with [[Florence]] evolved. The growing number of Italian traders moving to Hungary, specially to [[Buda]], helped this process. New thoughts were carried by the humanist prelates, among them [[Vitéz János]], archbishop of [[Esztergom]], one of the founders of Hungarian humanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fondazione-delbianco.org/inglese/relaz00_01/mester.htm |title=the influences of the florentine renaissance in hungary |publisher=Fondazione-delbianco.org |accessdate=July 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the long reign of emperor [[Sigismund of Luxemburg]] the [[Buda Castle|Royal Castle of Buda]] became probably the largest [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] palace of the late [[Middle Ages]]. King [[Matthias Corvinus]] (r. 1458–1490) rebuilt the palace in early Renaissance style and further expanded it.&lt;ref&gt;History section: Miklós Horler: Budapest műemlékei I, Bp: 1955, pp. 259–307&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Post-war reconstruction: László Gerő: A helyreállított budai vár, Bp, 1980, pp. 11–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the marriage in 1476 of King Matthias to [[Beatrice of Naples]], [[Buda]] became one of the most important artistic centres of the Renaissance north of the [[Alps]].&lt;ref name="czigany"&gt;Czigány, Lóránt, ''A History of Hungarian Literature'', "[http://mek.oszk.hu/02000/02042/html/5.html The Renaissance in Hungary]" (Retrieved May 10, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The most important humanists living in Matthias' court were [[Antonio Bonfini]] and the famous Hungarian poet [[Janus Pannonius]].&lt;ref name="czigany" /&gt; [[András Hess]] set up a printing press in Buda in 1472. Matthias Corvinus's library, the ''[[Bibliotheca Corviniana]]'', was Europe's greatest collections of secular books: historical chronicles, philosophic and scientific works in the 15th century. His library was second only in size to the Vatican Library. (However, the Vatican Library mainly contained Bibles and religious materials.)&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Tanner, The Raven King: Matthias Corvinus and the Fate of his Lost Library (New Haven: Yale U.P., 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1489, Bartolomeo della Fonte of Florence wrote that Lorenzo de' Medici founded his own Greek-Latin library encouraged by the example of the Hungarian king. Corvinus's library is part of UNESCO World Heritage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051105150132/http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID%3D15976%26URL_DO%3DDO_TOPIC%26URL_SECTION%3D201.html Documentary heritage concerning Hungary and recommended for inclusion in the Memory of the World International Register]. portal.unesco.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Culture in the Netherlands at the end of the 15th century was influenced by the Italian Renaissance through trade via [[Bruges]], which made Flanders wealthy.

The Renaissance in Northern Europe has been termed the "Northern Renaissance". While Renaissance ideas were moving north from Italy, there was a simultaneous southward spread of some areas of innovation, particularly in [[Renaissance music|music]].&lt;ref name="musical-quarterly"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Láng, Paul Henry|jstor=738699|title=The So Called Netherlands Schools|journal=The Musical Quarterly|volume=25|issue= 1|year=1939|pages=48–59|doi=10.1093/mq/xxv.1.48}}&lt;/ref&gt; The music of the 15th-century [[Burgundian School]] defined the beginning of the Renaissance in music, and the [[polyphony]] of the [[Franco-Flemish School|Netherlanders]], as it moved with the musicians themselves into Italy, formed the core of the first true international style in [[music]] since the standardization of [[Gregorian Chant]] in the 9th century.&lt;ref name="musical-quarterly" /&gt; The culmination of the Netherlandish school was in the music of the Italian [[composer]] [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]]. At the end of the 16th century Italy again became a center of musical innovation, with the development of the polychoral style of the [[Venetian School (music)|Venetian School]], which spread northward into Germany around 1600.

The paintings of the Italian Renaissance differed from those of the Northern Renaissance. [[Italian Renaissance]] artists were among the first to paint secular scenes, breaking away from the purely religious art of medieval painters. Northern Renaissance artists initially remained focused on religious subjects, such as the contemporary religious upheaval portrayed by [[Albrecht Dürer]]. Later, the works of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]] influenced artists to paint scenes of daily life rather than religious or classical themes. It was also during the Northern Renaissance that [[Flemish Primitives|Flemish]] brothers [[Hubert van Eyck|Hubert]] and [[Jan van Eyck]] perfected the [[oil painting]] technique, which enabled artists to produce strong colors on a hard surface that could survive for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/optg/hd_optg.htm Painting in Oil in the Low Countries and Its Spread to Southern Europe]'', [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] website. (Retrieved April 5, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; A feature of the Northern Renaissance was its use of the vernacular in place of Latin or Greek, which allowed greater freedom of expression. This movement had started in Italy with the decisive influence of [[Dante Alighieri]] on the development of vernacular languages; in fact the focus on writing in Italian has neglected a major source of Florentine ideas expressed in Latin.&lt;ref&gt;Celenza, Christopher (2004), ''The Lost Italian Renaissance: Humanists, Historians, and Latin's Legacy''. Baltimore, Johns Hopkins University Press&lt;/ref&gt; The spread of the printing press technology boosted the Renaissance in Northern Europe as elsewhere, with Venice becoming a world center of printing.

An early Italian humanist who came to [[Poland]] in the mid-15th century was [[Filippo Buonaccorsi]]. Many Italian artists came to Poland with [[Bona Sforza]] of Milan, when she married King [[Sigismund I the Old]] in 1518.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.poland.gov.pl/Bona,Sforza,%281494,%E2%80%93,1557%29,1958.html Bona Sforza (1494–1557)]. poland.gov.pl (Retrieved April 4, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; This was supported by temporarily strengthened monarchies in both areas, as well as by newly established universities.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the [http://www.uj.edu.pl/dispatch.jsp?item=uniwersytet/historia/historiatxt.jsp&amp;lang=en#narodziny re-establishment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021120144715/http://www.uj.edu.pl/dispatch.jsp?item=uniwersytet%2Fhistoria%2Fhistoriatxt.jsp&amp;lang=en |date=November 20, 2002 }} of [[Jagiellonian University]] in 1364.&lt;/ref&gt; The Polish Renaissance lasted from the late 15th to the late 16th century and was the [[Polish Golden Age|Golden Age]] of [[Polish culture]]. Ruled by the [[Jagiellon dynasty]], the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Kingdom of Poland]] (from 1569 known as the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]) actively participated in the broad European Renaissance. The multi-national Polish state experienced a substantial period of cultural growth thanks in part to a century without major wars – aside from conflicts in the sparsely populated eastern and southern borderlands. The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] spread peacefully throughout the country (giving rise to the [[Polish Brethren]]), while living conditions improved, cities grew, and exports of agricultural products enriched the population, especially the nobility (''[[szlachta]]'') who gained dominance in the new political system of [[Golden Liberty]]. The Polish Renaissance architecture has three periods of development.

The greatest monument of this style in the territory of the former [[Duchy of Pomerania]] is the [[Ducal Castle, Szczecin|Ducal Castle]] in [[Szczecin]].

===Portugal===

Although Italian Renaissance had a modest impact in Portuguese arts, Portugal was influential in broadening the European worldview,&lt;ref name=JCBL&gt;{{cite web|last=University|first=Brown, The John Carter Brown Library|title=Portuguese Overseas Travels and European Readers|url=http://www.brown.edu/Facilities/John_Carter_Brown_Library/Portugal/Overseas.html|work=Portugal and Renaissance Europe|publisher=JCB Exhibitions|accessdate=July 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; stimulating humanist inquiry. Renaissance arrived through the influence of wealthy Italian and Flemish merchants who invested in the profitable commerce overseas. As the pioneer headquarters of [[Age of Discovery|European exploration]], [[Lisbon]] flourished in the late 15th century, attracting experts who made several breakthroughs in mathematics, astronomy and naval technology, including [[Pedro Nunes]], [[João de Castro]], [[Abraham Zacuto]] and [[Martin Behaim]]. Cartographers [[Pedro Reinel]], [[Lopo Homem]], [[Estêvão Gomes]] and [[Diogo Ribeiro]] made crucial advances in mapping the world. Apothecary [[Tomé Pires]] and physicians [[Garcia de Orta]] and [[Cristóvão da Costa]] collected and published works on plants and medicines, soon translated by Flemish pioneer botanist [[Carolus Clusius]].

[[Bernardim Ribeiro]] developed [[Pastoral#Pastoral romances|pastoral romance]], plays by [[Gil Vicente]] fused it with popular culture, reporting the changing times, and [[Luís de Camões]] inscribed the Portuguese feats overseas in the epic poem [[Os Lusíadas]]. [[Travel literature]] especially flourished: [[João de Barros]], [[Fernão Lopes de Castanheda|Castanheda]], [[António Galvão]], [[Gaspar Correia]], [[Duarte Barbosa]], and [[Fernão Mendes Pinto]], among others, described new lands and were translated and spread with the new printing press.&lt;ref name="JCBL"/&gt; After joining the Portuguese exploration of Brazil in 1500, [[Amerigo Vespucci]] coined the term [[New World]],&lt;ref name=Bergin&gt;{{cite book|last=Bergin|first=Speake, Jennifer and Thomas G.|title=Encyclopedia of the Renaissance and the Reformation|year=2004|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-0-8160-5451-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VOb4hIp7EE8C&amp;lpg=PP490|page=490}}&lt;/ref&gt; in his letters to [[Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici]].

===Russia===
Renaissance trends from Italy and Central Europe influenced Russia in many ways. Their influence was rather limited, however, due to the large distances between Russia and the main European cultural centers and the strong adherence of Russians to their [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox traditions]] and [[Third Rome|Byzantine legacy]].

Prince [[Ivan III]] introduced [[Renaissance architecture]] to [[Russia]] by inviting a number of architects from [[Italy]], who brought new construction techniques and some Renaissance style elements with them, while in general following the traditional designs of [[Russian architecture]]. In 1475 the Bolognese architect [[Aristotele Fioravanti]] came to rebuild the [[Cathedral of the Dormition]] in the [[Moscow Kremlin]], which had been damaged in an earthquake. Fioravanti was given the 12th-century [[Assumption Cathedral in Vladimir|Vladimir Cathedral]] as a model, and he produced a design combining traditional Russian style with a Renaissance sense of spaciousness, proportion and symmetry.

[[File:Palais à facettes.jpg|thumb|The [[Palace of Facets]] on the [[Cathedral Square, Moscow|Cathedral Square]] of the [[Moscow Kremlin]]]]

In 1485 Ivan III commissioned the building of the royal residence, [[Terem Palace]], within the Kremlin, with [[Aloisio da Milano]] as the architect of the first three floors. He and other Italian architects also contributed to the construction of the Kremlin walls and towers. The small banquet hall of the [[Russian Tsar]]s, called the [[Palace of Facets]] because of its facetted upper story, is the work of two Italians, [[Marco Ruffo]] and [[Pietro Solario]], and shows a more Italian style. In 1505, an Italian known in Russia as [[Aleviz Novyi]] or Aleviz Fryazin arrived in Moscow. He may have been the Venetian sculptor, Alevisio Lamberti da Montagne. He built 12 churches for Ivan III, including the [[Cathedral of the Archangel]], a building remarkable for the successful blending of Russian tradition, Orthodox requirements and Renaissance style. It is believed that the Cathedral of the [[Metropolitan Peter]] in [[Vysokopetrovsky Monastery]], another work of Aleviz Novyi, later served as an inspiration for the so-called ''octagon-on-tetragon'' architectural form in the [[Moscow Baroque]] of the late 17th century.

Between the early 16th and the late 17th centuries, an original tradition of stone [[tented roof]] architecture developed in Russia. It was quite unique and different from the contemporary Renaissance architecture elsewhere in Europe, though some research terms the style 'Russian Gothic' and compares it with the European [[Gothic architecture]] of the earlier period. The Italians, with their advanced technology, may have influenced the invention of the stone tented roof (the wooden tents were known in Russia and Europe long before). According to one hypothesis, an Italian architect called [[Petrok Maly]] may have been an author of the Ascension Church in [[Kolomenskoye]], one of the earliest and most prominent tented roof churches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rusarch.ru/zagraevsky19.htm The first stone tented roof church and the origins of the tented roof architecture] by [[Sergey Zagraevsky]] at RusArch.ru {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 17th century the influence of [[Renaissance painting]] resulted in [[Russian icons]] becoming slightly more realistic, while still following most of the old icon painting [[Aesthetic canon|canon]]s, as seen in the works of [[Bogdan Saltanov]], [[Simon Ushakov]], [[Gury Nikitin]], [[Karp Zolotaryov]] and other [[Russian artists]] of the era. Gradually the new type of secular portrait painting appeared, called ''parsúna'' (from "persona" – person), which was transitional style between abstract iconographics and real paintings.

In the mid 16th-century Russians adopted [[printing]] from Central Europe, with [[Ivan Fyodorov (printer)|Ivan Fyodorov]] being the first known Russian printer. In the 17th century printing became widespread, and [[woodcut]]s became especially popular. That led to the development of a special form of [[folk art]] known as [[lubok]] printing, which persisted in Russia well into the 19th century.

A number of technologies from the European Renaissance period were adopted by Russia rather early and subsequently perfected to become a part of a strong domestic tradition. Mostly these were military technologies, such as [[cannon]] [[casting]] adopted by at least the 15th century. The [[Tsar Cannon]], which is the [[List of largest cannon by caliber|world's largest bombard by caliber]], is a masterpiece of Russian cannon making. It was cast in 1586 by [[Andrey Chokhov]] and is notable for its rich, decorative [[relief]]. Another technology, that according to one hypothesis originally was brought from Europe by the [[Italians]], resulted in the development of [[vodka]], the national beverage of Russia. As early as 1386 [[Genoa|Genoese]] ambassadors brought the first aqua vitae ("water of life") to [[Moscow]] and presented it to [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Grand Duke]] [[Dmitry Donskoy]]. The Genoese likely developed this beverage with the help of the [[alchemist]]s of [[Provence]], who used an [[Arab]]-invented [[distillation apparatus]] to convert [[grape]] [[must]] into [[alcohol]]. A Moscovite monk called [[Isidore (inventor)|Isidore]] used this technology to produce the first original [[Russian vodka]] c. 1430.&lt;ref name="pohlebkin_history"&gt;{{cite book

The Renaissance arrived in the Iberian peninsula through the Mediterranean possessions of the [[Crown of Aragon|Aragonese Crown]] and the city of [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]]. Many early Spanish Renaissance writers come from the [[Kingdom of Aragon]], including [[Ausiàs March]] and [[Joanot Martorell]]. In the [[Kingdom of Castile]], the early Renaissance was heavily influenced by the Italian humanism, starting with writers and poets such as [[Íñigo López de Mendoza, marqués de Santillana|the Marquis of Santillana]], who introduced the new Italian poetry to Spain in the early 15th century. Other writers, such as [[Jorge Manrique]], [[Fernando de Rojas]], [[Juan del Encina]], [[Juan Boscán Almogáver]] and [[Garcilaso de la Vega (poet)|Garcilaso de la Vega]], kept a close resemblance to the Italian canon. [[Miguel de Cervantes]]'s [[masterpiece]] [[Don Quixote]] is credited as the first Western novel. Renaissance humanism flourished in the early 16th century, with influential writers such as philosopher [[Juan Luis Vives]], grammarian [[Antonio de Nebrija]] and natural historian [[Pedro Mexía|Pedro de Mexía]].

Later Spanish Renaissance tended towards religious themes and mysticism, with poets such as [[Luis Ponce de León|fray Luis de León]], [[Teresa of Ávila]] and [[John of the Cross]], and treated issues related to the exploration of the [[New World]], with chroniclers and writers such as [[Inca Garcilaso de la Vega]] and [[Bartolomé de las Casas]], giving rise to a body of work, now known as [[Spanish Renaissance literature]]. The late Renaissance in Spain produced artists such as [[El Greco]] and composers such as [[Tomás Luis de Victoria]] and [[Antonio de Cabezón]].

==Historiography==

===Conception===
[[File:Vite.jpg|thumb|A cover of the ''Lives of the Artists'' by [[Giorgio Vasari]] ]]

The Italian [[artist]] and [[critic]] [[Giorgio Vasari]] (1511–1574) first used the term ''rinascita'' retrospectively in his book ''[[The Lives of the Artists]]'' (published 1550). In the book Vasari attempted to define what he described as a break with the barbarities of [[gothic art]]: the arts (he held) had fallen into decay with the collapse of the [[Roman Empire]] and only the [[Tuscana|Tuscan]] artists, beginning with [[Cimabue]] (1240–1301) and [[Giotto]] (1267–1337) began to reverse this decline in the arts. Vasari saw antique art as central to the rebirth of Italian art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.open.ac.uk/Arts/renaissance2/defining.htm |title=Defining the Renaissance, Open University |publisher=Open.ac.uk |accessdate=July 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, only in the 19th century did the [[French language|French]] word ''Renaissance'' achieve popularity in describing the self-conscious cultural movement based on revival of Roman models that began in the late-13th century. French [[historian]] [[Jules Michelet]] (1798–1874) defined "The Renaissance" in his 1855 work ''Histoire de France'' as an entire historical period, whereas previously it had been used in a more limited sense.&lt;ref name=mur&gt;Murray, P. and Murray, L. (1963) ''The Art of the Renaissance''. London: [[Thames &amp; Hudson]] (World of Art), p. 9. {{ISBN|978-0-500-20008-7}}.  "...in 1855 we find, for the first time, the word 'Renaissance' used — by the French historian Michelet — as an adjective to describe a whole period of history and not confined to the rebirth of Latin letters or a classically inspired style in the arts."&lt;/ref&gt; For Michelet, the Renaissance was more a development in science than in art and culture. He asserted that it spanned the period from [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] to Copernicus to [[Galileo]]; that is, from the end of the 15th century to the middle of the 17th century.&lt;ref name="Michelet, Jules 1847"/&gt; Moreover, Michelet distinguished between what he called, "the bizarre and monstrous" quality of the Middle Ages and the [[democracy|democratic]] values that he, as a vocal [[Republicanism|Republican]], chose to see in its character.&lt;ref name="brotton" /&gt; A French nationalist, Michelet also sought to claim the Renaissance as a French movement.&lt;ref name="brotton" /&gt;

The [[Switzerland|Swiss]] historian [[Jacob Burckhardt]] (1818–1897) in his ''[[The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy]]'' (1860), by contrast, defined the Renaissance as the period between Giotto and [[Michelangelo]] in Italy, that is, the 14th to mid-16th centuries. He saw in the Renaissance the emergence of the modern spirit of [[individualism|individuality]], which the [[Middle Ages]] had stifled.&lt;ref&gt;Burckhardt, Jacob. ''[http://www.boisestate.edu/courses/hy309/docs/burckhardt/burckhardt.html The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921145058/http://www.boisestate.edu/courses/hy309/docs/burckhardt/burckhardt.html |date=September 21, 2008 }}'' (trans. S.G.C Middlemore, London, 1878)&lt;/ref&gt; His book was widely read and became influential in the development of the modern interpretation of the [[Italian Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;Gay, Peter, ''Style in History'', New York: Basic Books, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Buckhardt has been accused{{by whom|date=November 2013}} of setting forth a linear [[Whig history|Whiggish]] view of history in seeing the Renaissance as the origin of the modern world.&lt;ref name="starn"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Starn, Randolph|jstor=2650779|title= Renaissance Redux|journal=The American Historical Review|volume=103|issue=1 |year=1998|pages=122–124|doi=10.2307/2650779}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, some historians have been much less keen to define the Renaissance as a historical age, or even as a coherent cultural movement. The historian Randolph Starn, of the [[University of California Berkeley]], stated in 1998:

{{quote|"Rather than a period with definitive beginnings and endings and consistent content in between, the Renaissance can be (and occasionally has been) seen as a movement of practices and ideas to which specific groups and identifiable persons variously responded in different times and places. It would be in this sense a network of diverse, sometimes converging, sometimes conflicting cultures, not a single, time-bound culture".&lt;ref name="starn" /&gt;

[[File:La masacre de San Bartolomé, por François Dubois.jpg|thumb|Painting of the [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]], an event in the [[French Wars of Religion]], by [[François Dubois]]]]
There is debate about the extent to which the Renaissance improved on the culture of the Middle Ages. Both Michelet and Burckhardt were keen to describe the progress made in the Renaissance towards the [[modern age]]. Burckhardt likened the change to a veil being removed from man's eyes, allowing him to see clearly.&lt;ref name="burckhardt-individual" /&gt;

{{quote|In the Middle Ages both sides of human consciousness – that which was turned within as that which was turned without – lay dreaming or half awake beneath a common veil.

On the other hand, many historians now point out that most of the negative social factors popularly associated with the medieval period – poverty, warfare, religious and political persecution, for example – seem to have worsened in this era, which saw the rise of [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavellian politics]], the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]], the corrupt [[Borgia]] Popes, and the intensified [[witch-hunt]]s of the 16th century. Many people who lived during the Renaissance did not view it as the "[[golden age]]" imagined by certain 19th-century authors, but were concerned by these social maladies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Savonarola]]'s popularity is a prime example of the manifestation of such concerns. Other examples include [[Philip II of Spain]]'s censorship of Florentine paintings, noted by Edward L. Goldberg, "Spanish Values and Tuscan Painting", ''Renaissance Quarterly'' (1998) p.914&lt;/ref&gt; Significantly, though, the artists, writers, and patrons involved in the cultural movements in question believed they were living in a new era that was a clean break from the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name="panofsky" /&gt; Some [[Historical materialism|Marxist historians]] prefer to describe the Renaissance in material terms, holding the view that the changes in art, literature, and philosophy were part of a general economic trend from [[feudalism]] towards [[capitalism]], resulting in a [[bourgeois]] class with leisure time to devote to the arts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hull.ac.uk/renforum/v2no2/siar.htm Renaissance Forum] at [[Hull University]], Autumn 1997 (Retrieved on May 10, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johan Huizinga]] (1872–1945) acknowledged the existence of the Renaissance but questioned whether it was a positive change. In his book ''[[The Autumn of the Middle Ages]]'', he argued that the Renaissance was a period of decline from the [[High Middle Ages]], destroying much that was important.&lt;ref name="huizinga" /&gt; The [[Latin|Latin language]], for instance, had evolved greatly from the classical period and was still a living language used in the church and elsewhere. The Renaissance obsession with classical purity halted its further evolution and saw Latin revert to its classical form. Robert S. Lopez has contended that it was a period of deep [[economic recession]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Lopez, Robert S. |author2=Miskimin, Harry A. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Economic Depression of the Renaissance|journal=Economic History Review|jstor=2591885|volume= 14 |year=1962|pages=408–26|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0289.1962.tb00059.x|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, [[George Sarton]] and [[Lynn Thorndike]] have both argued that [[Science|scientific]] progress was perhaps less original than has traditionally been supposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink=Lynn Thorndike|author=Thorndike, Lynn|year=1943|title=Some Remarks on the Question of the Originality of the Renaissance|pages=49–74|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|jstor=2707236|volume= 4|issue=1|doi=10.2307/2707236|last2=Johnson|first2=F.

P.|last5=Thorndike|first5=L.|bibcode=1961JHI....22..215C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, [[Joan Kelly]] argued that the Renaissance led to greater gender dichotomy, lessening the agency women had had during the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly-Gadol, Joan. "Did Women Have a Renaissance?" ''Becoming Visible: Women in European History.'' Edited by Renate Bridenthal and Claudia Koonz. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some historians have begun to consider the word ''Renaissance'' to be unnecessarily loaded, implying an unambiguously positive rebirth from the supposedly more primitive "[[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]", the [[Middle Ages]]. Most historians now prefer to use the term "[[Early Modern Europe|early modern]]" for this period, a more neutral designation that highlights the period as a transitional one between the Middle Ages and the modern era.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Greenblatt]] ''Renaissance Self-Fashioning: From More to Shakespeare'', [[University of Chicago Press]], 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; Others such as Roger Osborne have come to consider the Italian Renaissance as a repository of the myths and ideals of western history in general, and instead of rebirth of ancient ideas as a period of great innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Osborne, Roger |title=Civilization: a new history of the Western world|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oFZ3M8N73b0C&amp;pg=PA180|accessdate=December 10, 2011|date=November 1, 2006|publisher=Pegasus Books|isbn=978-1-933648-19-4|pages=180–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Renaissances==
The term ''Renaissance'' has also been used to define periods outside of the 15th and 16th centuries. [[Charles H. Haskins]] (1870–1937), for example, made a case for a [[Renaissance of the 12th century]].&lt;ref&gt;Haskins, Charles Homer, ''The Renaissance of the Twelfth Century'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1927 {{ISBN|0-674-76075-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other historians have argued for a [[Carolingian Renaissance]] in the 8th and 9th centuries, and still later for an [[Ottonian Renaissance]] in the 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;Hubert, Jean, ''L'Empire carolingien'' (English: ''The Carolingian Renaissance'', translated by James Emmons, New York: G. Braziller, 1970).&lt;/ref&gt; Other periods of cultural rebirth have also been termed "renaissances", such as the [[Bengal Renaissance]], [[Tamil Renaissance]], [[Nepal Bhasa renaissance]], [[al-Nahda]] or the [[Harlem Renaissance]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7798">'''Sebastian Sobecki''' (born 1973) is a medievalist specialising in English literature, history, and manuscript studies. 

== Biography ==
Sobecki is Professor of Medieval English Literature and Culture at the [[University of Groningen]], the oldest chair (founded in 1886) for English literature in the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fV3w7EOWUQkC&amp;q=1886#v=snippet&amp;q=1886&amp;f=false|title=One Hundred Years of English Studies in Dutch Universities: Seventeen Papers Read at the Centenary Conference, Groningen, 15-16 January 1986|last=Bunt|first=Gerrit|date=1986|website=|publisher=Rodopi|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2018-09-22|isbn=978-9062037896}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also holds by courtesy the Professorship of Old Germanic, established in 1881. Having received his education at the [[University of Cambridge]], Sobecki became an Assistant Professor at [[McGill University]] before being appointed at Groningen. He works on medieval English and early Tudor literature, particularly on Chaucer, Gower, manuscripts, politics, law, travel, and Anglo-European relations. Sobecki was awarded the John Hurt Fisher Prize by the John Gower Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rug.nl/staff/s.i.sobecki/|title=Department of English, University of Groningen|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wcu.edu/johngower/FisherPrize/index.html|title=John Hurt Fisher Prize|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sobecki has written widely on medieval and early modern topics, across 10 published and forthcoming books, and more than 50 academic articles and chapters, many of which have appeared in leading journals, including [[Speculum (journal)|''Speculum'']], ''English Literary History'', ''Studies in the Age of Chaucer'', ''Renaissance Studies'', ''[[The English Historical Review]]'', ''[[The Chaucer Review]]'', ''The Library'', ''New Medieval Literatures'', and ''[[The Review of English Studies]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rug.nl/staff/s.i.sobecki/research/publications.html|title=Department of English, University of Groningen, Sobecki, Publications|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with Michelle Karnes (University of Notre Dame), Sobecki has been appointed editor of the journal ''Studies in the Age of Chaucer''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rug.nl/let/organization/actueel/nieuwsberichten-2018/2018-05-18-sobecki-editor-sac?lang=en|title=Prof Sobecki appointed new co-editor Studies in the Age of Chaucer (SAC) Journal|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is completing his third authored book, ''The Material Politics of England’s Fifteenth-Century Literature'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press) and two volumes in the Oxford edition of [[Richard Hakluyt]]'s ''Principal Navigations''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hakluyt.org/|title=Hakluyt Editorial Project|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sobecki is also editing ''The Cambridge History of Medieval Travel Writing''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rug.nl/staff/s.i.sobecki/projects|title=Department of English, University of Groningen, Sobecki, Projects|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has made a number of important archival discoveries, such as identifying [[John Gower]]'s autograph hand,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.medievalists.net/2015/10/john-gowers-handwriting-identified/|title=John Gower's Handwriting identified|last=|first=|date=2015-10-22|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; finding a letter written for [[Margery Kempe]]'s son,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/08/archive-find-shows-medieval-mystic-margery-kempes-autobiography-doesnt-lie|title=Archive find shows medieval mystic Margery Kempe's autobiography 'doesn't lie'|last=Flood|first=Alison|date=2015-05-08|website=The Guardian|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; locating rebels linked to ''[[Piers Plowman]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.oup.com/2018/02/poaching-piers-plowman/|title=Poaching with Piers Plowman|last=|first=|date=2018-02-09|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; revealing the author ([[John Peyton (died 1635)|John Peyton]]) of the earliest English description of Poland,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newhistorian.com/espionage-in-early-modern-central-europe-revealed/4013/|title=Espionage in Early Modern Central Europe Revealed|last=Thake|first=Adam Steedman|date=2015-06-09|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/european/2015/05/how-the-spy-john-peyton-put-poland-on-the-map.html|title=How the spy John Peyton put Poland on the map (to keep King James on the throne)|last=|first=|date=2015-05-29|website=British Library|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and demonstrating connections between tax records and the [[General Prologue]] to [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.medievalists.net/2018/06/six-degrees-of-chaucer-how-southwark-shaped-the-canterbury-tales/|title=Six Degrees of Chaucer: How Southwark Shaped The Canterbury Tales|last=Cybulskie|first=Danièle|date=2018-06-04|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sobecki is also the voice behind the popular video recording of [[John Skelton]]'s '[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCckcTHWqKw Speke Parott'].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-29536411|title=#BBCtrending: The 500-year-old poem that captivated Reddit|last=|first=|date=2014-10-08|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.indy100.com/article/heres-what-the-english-language-sounded-like-500-years-ago--b1leV6aXmLg|title=Here's what the English language sounded like 500 years ago|last=Stewart|first=Ellen|date=2015|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4409">Each [[county]] or [[unitary authority]] in the [[United Kingdom]] maintains a '''sites and monuments record''' or SMR, consisting of  a list of known [[archaeology|archaeological]] sites. Many SMRs are now developing into much broader '''historic environment records''' (HERs), including information on historic buildings and designed landscapes.  Each record lists the location, type and period of site, along with a brief description and information on the location of more detailed sources of information such as site reports. This information is most commonly used to help inform decisions on the likelihood of new development affecting archaeological deposits. Government guidance ([[PPG 16]] and SPP&lt;ref name="SPP"&gt;{{cite web|title=A statement of the Scottish Government's policy on nationally important land use planning matters|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2010/02/03132605/0|accessdate=2 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Scotland) requires local authorities to consider archaeology a [[material consideration]] in determining planning applications and the SMR aids this consideration.

While mentioned in guidance, there is no statutory requirement for local authorities to fund an SMR (although this was a provision in the [[England and Wales Heritage Protection Bill]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100512160314/http://www.culture.gov.uk/reference_library/publications/5075.aspx National Archives record for the Heritage Protection Bill]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britarch.ac.uk/news/090701-heritageprotection Bill dropped]&lt;/ref&gt;) and there is great variety in implementation across the UK. Some SMRs are simple card indexes, others are [[command line]] [[Unix]] [[databases]] and others are more modern and [[Geographic information system|GIS]]-based. They provide an enormously useful resource but are not always fully exploited or appreciated by the public. Efforts to place SMRs on-line have met with success in certain parts of Britain, although some archaeologists have voiced concern that making vulnerable sites better known to the public endangers them further, especially through illicit [[metal detector|metal-detecting]].  The contrary argument is that informing the public of historic sites near them will in fact increase protection, as local people will take pride in their [[cultural heritage]] and seek to protect it.  In 2007, an updated version of best practice guidance for HERs "Informing the Future of the Past: Guidelines for Historic Environment Records"&lt;ref name="IFP"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gilman|first1=Paul|last2=Newman|first2=Martin|title=Informing the Future of the Past: Guidelines for Historic Environment Records (Second Edition)|url=http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/ifp/|publisher=English Heritage, Historic Scotland, the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland (RCAHMS), the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales (RCAHMW), the Association of Local Government Archaeological Officers UK (ALGAO UK) and the Archaeology Data Service (ADS).|accessdate=24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been made available on-line.

Members of the public can usually consult their local SMR, or request a search be undertaken on their behalf, and they are commonly used by local [[historian]]s, archaeological organisations and academics.  An increasing number of SMRs and HERs are becoming available to search on-line, in England particularly via the [[Heritage Gateway]].&lt;ref name="HG"&gt;{{cite web|title=Heritage Gateway|url=http://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/CHR/|accessdate=2 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Scotland, the [[PASTMAP]] website&lt;ref name="PASTMAP"&gt;{{cite web|title=PASTMAP|url=http://jura.rcahms.gov.uk/PASTMAP/start.jsp|accessdate=2 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; presents comprehensive national datasets on [[monument]]s, buildings, gardens and designed landscapes, [[shipwreck|wrecks]], and an increasing number of local records.

'''The Elstree Project''' is an [[oral history]] project which began in 2010. The project is conducted in partnership by the [[University of Hertfordshire]] and Elstree Screen Heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Making movie history in Borehamwood and Elstree|url=http://www.hertsmere.gov.uk/News/Articles/July/Making-movie-history-in-Borehamwood-and-Elstree.aspx|work=Hertsmere|publisher=Hertsmere Borough Council|accessdate=2 February 2014|date=10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The project is endorsed by the [[BECTU]] History Project&lt;ref name="UHSHIN" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BECTU" /&gt; and [[Elstree Studios#Elstree Studios, Shenley Rd, Borehamwood|Elstree Studios]].&lt;ref name="UHSHIN" /&gt;

== Background ==

The Elstree Project interviews cast and crew members who have worked at any of the six main studios in Elstree and Borehamwood: [[Elstree Studios#Elstree Studios, Shenley Rd, Borehamwood|Elstree Studios]] (formerly [[Associated British Picture Corporation|ABPC]], later [[EMI Films|EMI]]), BBC Elstree Centre (formerly [[Associated Television#Studios|ATV]]), [[MGM-British Studios]], Danziger's New Elstree Studios, British and Dominion Studios and The Gate studios.

The project has interviewed crew members from various departments including continuity, sound, post-production, camera and lighting, props and scenery and construction.  Writers, producers and directors have also been interviewed, including [[Jan Harlan]], [[Roger Moore]],&lt;ref name="BWTprint" /&gt; [[Brian Blessed]],&lt;ref name="whtimes1" /&gt; [[Kenneth Cope]],&lt;ref name="whtimes1" /&gt; [[Walter Murch]],&lt;ref name="TEPUSA" /&gt; and [[Steven Spielberg]].&lt;ref name="TEPUSA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="whtimes2" /&gt;

== Access ==

There is currently no method of public access to the complete archive of interviews. However, the project content has been gradually made available through excerpts and edited documentaries.  Content is also accessible in the Elstree and Borehamwood museum.&lt;ref name="BWT1" /&gt;

The project has hosted three seasons of screenings, showing either three films or two films and a double-bill of television episodes of productions made at the studios in Elstree and Borehamwood.  These have included ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' (1980),&lt;ref name="whtimes3" /&gt; ''[[The Prisoner]]'' (TV 1967-68),&lt;ref name="watfordob" /&gt; ''[[Flash Gordon (film)|Flash Gordon]]'' (1980)&lt;ref name="whtimes1" /&gt; and ''[[Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased)]]'' (TV 1969-70).&lt;ref name="whtimes1" /&gt;  Edited extracts from the interviews recorded have been made into documentaries which have been premiered before each screening.

The 17-minute-long documentary which preceded ''The Shining'', entitled ''Staircases to Nowhere: Making Stanley Kubrick's 'The Shining''', gained attention from film blogs.&lt;ref name="openculture" /&gt;&lt;ref name="overlook" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fandor.com/keyframe/daily-kubrick-lacma |title=DAILY Kubrick @ LACMA |accessdate=23 January 2013 |website=Fandor |date=October 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally containing interviews with five crew members from the film,&lt;ref name="UHSHIN" /&gt; it was expanded to fifty-five minutes with additional interviews with four more crew members and with Kubrick's widow [[Christiane Kubrick|Christiane]]. Project content has been used by researchers and authors, such as Kiri Waldon's book ''British Film Studios'',&lt;ref name="book" /&gt; as well as specially created for publication in published works such as the DVD release of ''Elstree Story''.&lt;ref name="network" /&gt;

A documentary, made from project interviews, was completed in October 2014.  ''From Borehamwood to Hollywood: The Rise and Fall and Rise of Elstree'', is a 100-minute-long film which tells the story of 100 years of filmmaking in the two towns.  The film is narrated by Barbara Windsor.&lt;ref name="BWT2" /&gt;

== Events ==
The project has run several screenings local to the area, and also notably gathered together the crew of [[The Shining (film)|''The Shining'']] to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the release of the film, in partnership with [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]]. The organisers reunited 25 crew members from the film, along with [[Pixar]] director [[Lee Unkrich]], a fan of the film, and brought them back to Elstree Studios for the first time, before screening the film to an audience, with Q&amp;A.  [[Danny Lloyd]], who played Danny in the film, also provided a pre-recorded message for the audience, describing his enjoyment of making the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/shining-35th-anniversary-cast-crew-797937|title='The Shining' 35th Anniversary: Cast and Crew Talk Kubrick, Ghosts and Conspiracy Theories|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/movies/shining-2/shine-shining-turns-35/|title=Shine On: The Shining Turns 35|last=Pierce|first=Nev|website=Empire|language=en|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.elstreestudios.co.uk/News/the_shining_reunion.aspx|title=The Shining Reunion|last=Studios|first=Elstree|website=www.elstreestudios.co.uk|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.borehamwoodtimes.co.uk/news/13027874.Terrifying_twins_return_to_Borehamwood_for_The_Shining_reunion/|title=Terrifying twins return to Borehamwood for The Shining reunion|website=Borehamwood Times|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3700">[[Image:USICOMOS Exchange.png|right]]The '''US/ICOMOS International Exchange Program''' is an exchange program for young professions in [[historic preservation]] through the United States National Committee of the [[ICOMOS|International Council on Monuments and Sites]]. The aim of the program is to promote an understanding of [[international preservation]] policies, methods and techniques that lead to a continuing dialogue between countries. As of 2007, nearly 600 young preservation professionals and over 70 countries have participated in this program since its creation in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icomos.org/usicomos/International_Exchange_Program/USICOMOS_International_Exchange_Program.htm US/ICOMOS International Exchange Program&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Program Overview ==
The program began with a one-time exchange between [[US/ICOMOS]] and [[ICOMOS United Kingdom]]. It since has expanded to involve between 20 and 30 young preservation professionals each year. US/ICOMOS internships are geared toward individuals who are in their last year of a relevant graduate program or have been working for 1–3 years in a professional capacity. The program is very competitive in that only 1 in 5 applicants are awarded internships in any given year.

Interns are selected on a competitive basis for participation in the US/ICOMOS International Exchange Program. Internships are approximately 12 weeks in length and are usually held during the summer (from June to August), although some internships may be held at other times of the year. US/ICOMOS hosts all U.S. and international interns for a program orientation in Washington, DC. Interns then disperse to their various host organizations where they complete a preservation-related project designed by the host organization. At the end of the summer, all interns reconvene in Washington, DC for a final farewell program.

The program is made possible through generous grants from many U.S. foundations, government agencies and individual contributors, and ICOMOS National Committees of participating countries.

== Intern Qualifications ==
Interns must be graduate students or young professionals with at minimum an undergraduate degree in a preservation-related field. Candidates are asked to submit a curriculum vitae, two letters of recommendation, a 500-word essay describing their reasons for wanting to participate in the program, and examples of their work. Participants are selected on the basis of skill, demonstrated commitment to historic preservation, previous experience and academic concentration in the field and the ability to represent their country in an exchange program. In addition, interns are chosen whose skills, training, interest and previous experience match the needs of host organizations. Applications submitted by U.S. citizens are selected for specific internships by a jury of professional members of US/ICOMOS; applications from other ICOMOS national committees are screened at the national committee level, and then forwarded to US/ICOMOS for selection and assignments. The file of the strongest candidate(s) for a particular internship is sent to the host office (in the U.S. and in participating countries) for review and final approval.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35709">: ''This article is about urban history as a subject. See [[history of the city]] for a chronological description of cities.''
'''Urban history''' is a field of [[history]] that examines the historical nature of [[city|cities]] and [[town]]s, and the process of [[urbanization]]. The approach is often multidisciplinary, crossing boundaries into fields like [[social history]], [[architectural history]], [[urban sociology]], [[urban geography]], [[business history]], and [[archaeology]]. [[Urbanization]] and [[industrialization]] were popular themes for 20th-century historians, often tied to an implicit model of [[modernization]], or the transformation of rural traditional societies.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Frisch,  "American urban history as an example of recent historiography." ''History and Theory'' (1979): 350-377. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2504535 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of urbanization focuses on the processes of by which existing populations concentrate themselves in [[Urban area|urban localities]] over time, and on the social, political, cultural and economic contexts of cities. Most urban scholars focus on the "metropolis," a large or especially important city.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Keene, "Ideas of the metropolis," ''Historical Research'' (2011) 84#225 pp 379-398.&lt;/ref&gt; There is much less attention to small cities, towns or (until recently) to suburbs. However social historians find small cities much easier to handle because they can use census data to cover or sample the entire population.  In the United States from the 1920s to the 1990s many of the most influential monographs began as one of the 140 PhD dissertations at Harvard University directed by [[Arthur Schlesinger, Sr.]] (1888-1965) or [[Oscar Handlin]] (1915-2011).&lt;ref&gt;Bruce M. Stave, ed., ''The Making of Urban History: Historiography through Oral History'' (1977) [https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0803908687 in Google]&lt;/ref&gt;  The field grew rapidly after 1970, leading one prominent scholar, [[Stephan Thernstrom]], to note that urban history apparently deals with cities, or with city-dwellers, or with events that transpired in cities, with attitudes toward cities – which makes one wonder what is ''not'' urban history.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond A. Mohl, "The History of the American City," in William H. Cartwright and Richard L.  Watson Jr. eds., ''Reinterpretation of American History and Culture'' (1973)  pp 165-205 quote p 165&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparative studies==
Only a handful of studies attempt a global history of cities, notably [[Lewis Mumford]], ''[[The City in History]]'' (1961).&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Paul Bairoch]], ''Cities and Economic Development, From the Dawn of History to the Present'' (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;  Representative comparative studies include Leonardo Benevolo, ''The European City'' (1993);  Christopher R. Friedrichs, ''The Early Modern City, 1450-1750'' (1995), and James L. McClain, John M. Merriman, and Ugawa Kaoru. eds. ''Edo and Paris'' (1994) (Edo was the old name for Tokyo).&lt;ref&gt;They are reviewed in Wolfgang Reinhard, "New Contributions to Comparative Urban History," ''[[Journal of Early Modern History]]'' (1997) 1#2 pp 176-181.&lt;/ref&gt;

Architectural history is its own field, but occasionally overlaps with urban history.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Spiro Kostof]], ''The City Shaped: Urban Patterns and Meanings Through History'' (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

The political role of cities in helping state formation—and in staying independent—is the theme of [[Charles Tilly]] and [[W. P. Blockmans]], eds., ''Cities and the Rise of States in Europe, A.D. 1000 to 1800'' (1994).  Comparative elite studies—who was in power—are typified by Luisa Passerini, Dawn Lyon, Enrica Capussotti and Ioanna Laliotou, eds. ''Who Ran the Cities? City Elites and Urban Power Structures in Europe and North America, 1750-1940'' (2008) .&lt;ref&gt;See also Frederic Cople Jaher, ''The Urban Establishment: Upper Strata in Boston, New York, Charleston, Chicago, and Los Angeles'' (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;  Labor activists and socialists often had national or international networks that circulated ideas and tactics.&lt;ref&gt;Shelton Stromquist, "'Thinking globally; acting locally': Municipal Labour and Socialist Activism in Comparative Perspective, 1890–1920," ''Labour History Review'' (2009) 74#3 pp 233-256&lt;/ref&gt;

==Great Britain==
{{Main|Historiography of the United Kingdom#Urban history}}
In the 1960s, the historiography of Victorian towns and cities began to flourish in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Gary W. Davies, "The rise of urban history in Britain c. 1960-1978" (PhD dissertation, University of Leicester, 2014) [https://lra.le.ac.uk/bitstream/2381/29036/1/2014daviesgwphd.pdf online, wWillith detailed bibliography pp 205-40]&lt;/ref&gt; Much attention focused first on the Victorian city, with topics ranging from demography, public health, the working-class, and local culture.&lt;ref&gt;H. J. Dyos, and Michael Wolff, eds. ''Victorian City: Images and Realities'' (2 vol. 1973).&lt;/ref&gt; In recent decades, topics regarding class, capitalism, and social structure gave way to studies of the cultural history of urban life, as well as the study of groups such as women, prostitutes, migrants from rural areas, and immigrants from the Continent and from the British Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Myers and Ian Grosvenor, "Birmingham Stories: Local Histories of Migration and Settlement and the Practice of History." ''Midland History'' (2011) 36#2 pp 149-162&lt;/ref&gt; The urban environment itself became a major topic, as studies of the material fabric of the city, and the structure of urban space, became more prominent.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Gunn, "Urbanization" in Chris Williams, ed., ''Eight Companion to 19th-Century Britain'' (2007) pp 238-252&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians have almost always focused on London, but they have also studied small towns and cities from the medieval period, as well as the urbanization that attended the industrial revolution. In the second half of the 19th century, provincial centers such as Birmingham, Glasgow, Leeds, Liverpool, and Manchester doubled in size, and became regional capitals. They were all conurbations that included smaller cities and suburbs in their [[catchment area]]. Available scholarly materials have become quite comprehensive today.&lt;ref&gt;D. M. Palliser,  Peter Clark, and Martin Daunton, eds. ''The Cambridge Urban History of Britain'' (3 vol 2000), which reaches down to 1950.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Urban biography==
Urban biography is the narrative history of a city, and often reaches a general audience. Urban biographies cover the interrelationships among various dimensions, such as politics, demography, business, high culture, popular culture, housing, neighborhoods, and ethnic groups.  It covers [[municipal government]] as well as physical expansion, growth and decline.  Historians often focus on the largest and most dominant city—usually the national capital—which geographers call a "[[primate city]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Garrett Nagle|title=Advanced Geography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cq9uFL07Y6wC&amp;pg=PA291|year=2000|publisher=Oxford U.P.|page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians have developed typologies of cities, emphasizing their geographic location and economic specialization. In the United States [[Carl Bridenbaugh]] was a pioneer in the historiography.  He emphasized the major port cities on the East Coast, the largest of which were Boston and Philadelphia, each with fewer than 40,000 people at the time of the American Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Bridenbaugh, ''Cities in the Wilderness: The First Century of Urban Life in America, 1625-1742'' (1938), and ''Cities in Revolt: Urban Life in America, 1743-1776'' (1955)&lt;/ref&gt;  Other historians have covered the port cities up and down the East Coast, the Gulf Coast, and the West Coast, along with the river ports along the Ohio, Mississippi, and Missouri rivers. Industrialization began in New England, and several small cities have scholarly histories. The railroad cities of the West, stretching from Chicago to Kansas City to Wichita to Denver have been well treated. Blake McKelvey provides an encyclopedic overview of the functions of major cities in ''The Urbanization of America, 1860-1915'' (1963), and ''The Emergence of Metropolitan America, 1915-1966'' (1968)

==Large scale reference books==
Peter Clark of the Urban History Center of the University of Leicester was the general editor (and Cambridge University Press the publisher) of a massive history of British cities and towns, running 2800 pages in 75 chapters by 90 scholars.  The chapters deal not with biographies of individual cities, but with economic, social or political themes that cities had in common.&lt;ref&gt;D. M. Palliser, ed., ''The Cambridge Urban History of Britain, vol. I, 600-1540'' (2000); P. A. Clark, ed., ''The Cambridge Urban History of Britain vol. II, 1540-1840''; M. J. Daunton, ed., ''The Cambridge Urban History of Britain, vol. III, 1840 1950.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See review by: Albert J. Schmidt, ''Journal of Social History'' (2003) 36#3 pp. 781-784 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3790746 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Two highly influential, authoritative and comprehensive compendia of European urban history were also compiled by Barry Haynes of the Centre for Urban History at Leicester University in 1990 and 1991, published by Leicester University. These books made a significant contribution to the bibliographic review of urban history research and literature in both Eastern and Western Europe.

In the United States a very different approach was sponsored by the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] has sponsored large historical encyclopedias for many states and several cities, most notably the [[Encyclopedia of Chicago]] (2004; also online edition) and  [[The Encyclopedia of New York City]] (1995, 2nd ed. 2010) They followed the model of an earlier encyclopedia of Cleveland&lt;ref&gt;David D. Van Tassel and , John J. Brabowski, eds., ''The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History'' (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; and relished the details about neighborhoods, people, organizations and events, without imposing any overall theme.

===Suburbs===
{{main|Suburb}}
A new subgenre is the history of specific suburbs.  Historians have concentrated on specific places, typically focusing on the origins of the suburb in relation to the central city, the pattern of growth, different functions (such as residential or industrial), local politics, as well as racial exclusion and gender roles.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth McManus and Philip J. Ethington, "Suburbs in transition: new approaches to suburban history," ''Urban History'' (2007) 34#2 pp 317-337&lt;/ref&gt; The main overview is [[Kenneth T. Jackson]]'s ''[[Crabgrass Frontier]]'' (1987).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite crabgrass}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many people have assumed that early-20th-century suburbs were enclaves for middle-class whites, a concept that carries tremendous cultural influence yet is actually stereotypical. Many suburbs are based on a heterogeneous society of working-class and minority residents, many of whom share the [[American Dream]] of upward social status via home ownership. Sies (2001) argues that it is necessary to examine how "suburb" is defined as well as the distinction made between cities and suburbs, geography, economic circumstances, and the interaction of numerous factors that move research beyond acceptance of stereotyping and its influence on scholarly assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Corbin Sies, "North American Suburbs, 1880-1950," ''Journal of Urban History,'' March 2001, Vol. 27 Issue 3, pp 313-46&lt;/ref&gt;

==New urban history==
The "new urban history" emerged in the 1960s as a branch of [[Social history]] seeking to understand the "city as process" and, through quantitative methods, to learn more about the inarticulate masses in the cities, as opposed to the mayors and elites. Much of the attention is devoted to individual behavior, and how the intermingling of classes and ethnic groups operated inside a particular city. Smaller cities are much easier to handle when it comes to tracking a sample of individuals over ten or 20 years.

Common themes include the social and political changes, examinations of class formation, and racial/ethnic tensions.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Thernstrom and Richard Sennett, eds. ''Nineteenth-century Cities: Essays in the New Urban History'' (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;   A major early study was Stephan Thernstrom's ''Poverty and Progress: Social Mobility in a Nineteenth Century City'' (1964), which used census records to study [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]], 1850-1880. A seminal, landmark book, it sparked interest in the 1960s and 1970s in quantitative methods, census sources,  "bottom-up" history, and the measurement of upward social mobility by different ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Frisch, "''Poverty and Progress:'' A Paradoxical Legacy," ''Social Science History,'' Spring 1986, Vol. 10 Issue 1, pp 15-22&lt;/ref&gt;

Other exemplars of the new urban history included
*Kathleen Conzen,  ''Immigrant Milwaukee, 1836-1860'' (1976)
* David F. Crew. '' Town in the Ruhr: A Social History of Bochum, 1860-1914'' (1986)
* Alan Dawley, ''Class and Community: The Industrial Revolution in Lynn'' (1975; 2nd ed. 2000)

There were no overarching social history theories that emerged developed to explain urban development. Inspiration from urban geography and sociology, as well as a concern with workers (as opposed to labor union leaders), families, ethnic groups, racial segregation, and women's roles have proven useful&lt;ref&gt;Dennis, R., 1991. History, geography, and historical geography. Social Science History, 15(2), pp.265-288.&lt;/ref&gt;. Historians now view the contending groups within the city as "agents" who shape the direction of urbanization.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Marsh and Lizabeth Cohen. "Old Forms, New Visions: New Directions in United States Urban History," ''Pennsylvania History,'' Winter 1992, Vol. 59 Issue 1, pp 21-28&lt;/ref&gt; The sub-field has flourished in Australia—where most people live in cities.&lt;ref&gt;Lionel Frost, and Seamus O'Hanlon, "Urban History and the Future of Australian Cities," ''Australian Economic History Review'' March 2009, Vol. 49 Issue 1, pp 1-18&lt;/ref&gt;

Demographic perspectives make use of the large volume of census data from the mid-19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Lampard, ''The Urbanizing World,'' in [[H. J. Dyos]] and Michael Wolff, eds., The Victorian City: Images and Realities, vol. 1 (1973), pp.&amp;nbsp;3–58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James H. Jackson, Jr.. "Alltagsgeschichte, Social Science History and the Study of Mundane Movements in 19th-Century Germany," ''Historical Social Research'' (1991) 16#1 pp23-47, explains the value of employment records, marriage contracts, vital records and continuous residency registers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than being strictly areas of geographical segmentation, spatial patterns and concepts of place reveal the struggles for power of various social groups, including gender, class, race, and ethnic identity&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Competition, contingency, and destabilization in urban assemblages and actor-networks. Urban Geography, vol. 39 (5), pp. 655-666; https://doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2017.1382307 &lt;/ref&gt;. The spatial patterns of residential and business areas give individual cities their distinct identities and, considering the social aspects attendant to the patterns, create a more complete picture of how those cities evolved, shaping the lives of their citizens.&lt;ref&gt;James Connolly, "Bringing the City Back in: Space and Place in the Urban History of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era," ''Journal of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era,'' July 2002, Vol. 1 Issue 3, pp 258-278.  The importance of the materiality of specific spaces and places is also treated in Ralph Kingston, "[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/berg/cash/2010/00000007/00000001/art00006 Mind over Matter? History and the Spatial Turn]," ''Cultural and Social History,'' 2010, Vol. 7, Issue 1, pp. 111–121.&lt;/ref&gt;

New techniques include the use of historical [[Geographic information system|GIS]]  data.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Gordon, "Lost in space, or confessions of an accidental geographer,"''[[International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing]]'' (2011) 5#1 pp 1-22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-Western cities==
Since the 1980s extensive research has been done of the cities of the Ottoman Empire, where standardized record keeping and centralized archives have facilitated work on [[Aleppo]], [[Damascus]], [[Byblos]], [[Sidon]], [[Jericho]], [[Hama]], [[Nablus]] and [[Jerusalem]]. Historians have explored the social bases of political factionalism, histories of elites and commoners, different family structures and gender roles, marginalized groups such as prostitutes and slaves, and relationships between Muslims and Christians and Jews.&lt;ref&gt;James A. Reilly, "Ottoman Syria: Social History Through an Urban Lens," ''History Compass'' (2012) 10#1 pp 70-80.&lt;/ref&gt;  Increasingly work is underway on African cities,&lt;ref&gt;Laurent Fourchard, "Between World History and State Formation: New Perspectives On Africa's Cities," ''Journal of African History'' (2011) 52#2 pp 223-248.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Burton, ed., ''Urban History in Africa: The Urban Experience in Eastern Africa c. 1750–2000'' (Nairobi: The British Institute in Eastern Africa, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;
as well as South Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Sharif Uddin Ahmed, ed., ''Dhaka: Past, Present, Future'' (1991) is Bangladesh history from an urban planning perspective&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Heitzman, "Middle Towns to Middle Cities in South Asia, 1800-2007," ''Journal of Urban History'' (2008) 35#1 pp 15-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

In China the Maoist ideology privileged the uprising of the peasants as the central force in Chinese history, which led to a neglect of urban history until the 1980s. Academics were then allowed to assert that peasant rebellions were often reactionary rather than revolutionary, and that China's modernizers of the 1870s made significant advances, even if they were capitalists.&lt;ref&gt;David D. Buck "The Study of Urban History in the People's Republic of China," ''Urban History Yearbook'' (1987), pp 61-75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruce M. Stave, "A Conversation with Zhou Lei: Urban History and Development in Beijing (Peking)," ''Journal of Urban History'' (1988) 14#2 pp 254-68&lt;/ref&gt;

For over a century—since [[Heinrich Schliemann]] searched for and found ancient Troy&lt;ref&gt;David A. Traill, ''Schliemann of Troy: Treasure and Deceit'' (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;—archaeologists and ancient historians have studies the cities of the ancient world.&lt;ref&gt;See  [[Marc van de Mieroop]] ''The Ancient Mesopotamian City.'' (Oxford University Press, 1999) and John Hyslop, ''Inka Settlement Planning''. (U. of Texas Press, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Images and cultural role==
The study of the culture of specific cities and the role of cities in shaping national culture is a more recent development which provides nontraditional ways of "reading" cities. A representative class is Carl E. Schorske, ''Fin-De-Siecle Vienna: Politics and Culture'' (1980).  The basis for some of this approach stems from a [[post-modern]] theory including the cultural anthropology of [[Clifford Geertz]]. One example is Alan Mayne's ''The Imagined Slum: Newspaper Representation in Three Cities, 1870-1914''(1993), a study of how slums were represented in the newspapers in [[Sydney]], [[San Francisco]], and [[Birmingham]]. The accounts provided dramatic life stories but failed to integrate the agendas and animosities of city officials, property owners, residents, and local businessmen.  As a result, they did not reveal the true inner-city social structures.  Nevertheless, the middle class accepted the image of and decided to act on the [[social construction]]s, leading to the reformers' demands for [[slum clearance]] and [[urban renewal]].&lt;ref&gt;See also Alan Mayne, "  Representing The Slum," ''Urban History Yearbook'' (1990), Vol. 17, pp 66-84&lt;/ref&gt;

As Rosen and Tarr point out, environmental history has made great strides since the 1970s, but its focus is primarily on rural areas, leading to a neglect of urban issues such as air pollution, sewage, clean water—and the concentration of large numbers of horses.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Meisn Rosen, and Joel Arthur Tarr, "The importance of an urban perspective in environmental history," ''Journal of Urban History'' (1994) 20#3 pp 299-310&lt;/ref&gt;  Historians are beginning to integrate urban history and environmental history.&lt;ref&gt;Geneviève Massard-Guilbaud, and Peter Thorsheim, "Cities, Environments, and European History," ''Journal of Urban History'' (2007) 33#5 pp 691-701, introduces a special issue with case studies from Austria, Britain, France, Germany, and Italy.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus far most of the attention concerns the negative impact on the environment, rather than how the environment shaped the urbanization process.&lt;ref&gt;Lezlie Morinière, "Environmentally Influenced Urbanisation: Footprints Bound for Town?" ''Urban Studies'' (2012) 49#2 pp 435-450, examines 147 studies&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature and philosophy===
In literature the city has long stood as one of the most potent symbols of human capacities and nature.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Schorske, "The Idea of the City in European Thought: Voltaire to Spengler," in ''The Historian and the City'', ed. Oscar Handlin and John Burchard (Harvard U.P., 1963)&lt;/ref&gt; As the largest and most enduring creation of human imagination and hands, and as the largest and most sustained site of human association and interaction, the city has been seen as a marker of what humans are and of what they do. This signification has almost always been shaded with ambivalence. In old legends, epics, and utopias, cities (both actual and symbolic) appeared as places of exceptional but also contradictory meaning. The histories of Troy, Babel, Sodom, Babylon, and Rome were viewed, in Western cultures, as standing for human power, wisdom, creativity, and vision, but also for human presumption, perversion, and fated destruction. Images of the modern city restated this ambivalence with fresh intensity. Great modern cities like London, Paris, Berlin, and New York, have repeatedly been portrayed as sites of opportunity and peril, power and helplessness, vitality and decadence, creativity and perplexity. This contradictory face of the city has appeared so often in Western thought as to suggest an essential psychological and cultural anxiety about human civilization, an anxiety about humanity’s relation to their created world and about "humanity" itself. This is especially true of the “modern” city, filled with human artifice and moral contradiction.&lt;ref&gt;See also Lewis Mumford, "Utopia, The City, and The Machine," ''Daedalus'' (Spring 1965): 271-92; Philip Fisher, "City Matters: City Minds," ''The Worlds of Victorian Fiction'', ed. Jerome Buckley (Cambridge, Mass., 1975); Burton Pike, ''The Image of the City in Modern Literature'' (Princeton, 1981), Marshall Berman, ''All That Is Solid Melts Into Air: The Experience of Modernity'' (New York, 1982); David Harvey, ''Consciousness and the Urban Experience: Studies in the History and Theory of Capitalist Urbanization'' (Baltimore, 1985); Judith Walkowitz, ''City of Dreadful Delight: Narratives of Sexual Danger in Late Victorian London'' (Chicago, 1992); Graeme Gilloch, ''Myth and Metropolis: Walter Benjamin and the City'' (Cambridge, Eng., 1996); Peter Fritzsche, ''Reading Berlin 1900'' (Cambridge, Mass., 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarship==
The [[Journal of Urban History]] has been a leading quarterly journal with articles and reviews since 1975. The Urban History Association was founded in 1988 with 284 members; it now has over 400. It sponsored the "Sixth Biennial Urban History Association Conference" in New York, October 25–28, 2012. It awards prizes for the best book prize, best article, and best PhD dissertation.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://uha.udayton.edu/ UHA website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150312054102/http://uha.udayton.edu/ |date=2015-03-12 }}; its semiannual [http://uha.udayton.edu/news.html newsletters are online]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harold James Dyos|H.J. Dyos]]  (1921-1978) at the University of Leicester was the leading promoter of urban history in Britain, leading the way especially into the study of Victorian cities.&lt;ref&gt;H.J. Dyos, ''Exploring the Urban Past: Essays in Urban History'' edited by David Cannadine and David Reeder (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;  He formed the Urban History Study Group in 1962; its newsletter became the ''Urban History Yearbook'' (1974-1991) and then the journal ''Urban History'' (1992–present).  His edited volume on ''The Study of Urban History'' (1968) opened up the methodology and stimulated young scholars, as did the conferences he organized and the book series he edited.  Dyos rejected the quantitative methods of the New Urban History because he was not interested in the individual people in the city, but in the larger social structure, such as the slum or the entire city.&lt;ref&gt;Seymour J. Mandelbaum, "H. J. Dyos and British Urban History," ''The Economic History Review'' (1985)  38#3 pp. 437–447, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2596999 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1993, the daily email discussion list '''H-Urban'''  has enabled historians, graduate students and others interested in urban history and urban studies to communicate current research and research interests easily; to query and discuss new approaches, sources, methods, and tools of analysis; and to comment on contemporary historiography. The logs are open to searches, and membership is free. H-Urban seeks to inform historians on such matters as announcements, calls for papers, conferences, awards, fellowships, availability of new sources and archives, reports on new research, and teaching tools, including books, articles, works-in-progress, research reports, primary historical documents (for example, model ordinances, federal/state/local reports, addresses of city officials), syllabi, bibliographies, software, datasets, and multimedia publications or projects. It commissions its own book reviews. H-Urban has 2,856 subscribers (as of 2012) and is the oldest of the H-Net network of discussion lists.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://langinnovate.msu.edu/~urban/ H-Urban website]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Waffen-SS im Einsatz ''''' (''Waffen-SS in Action'') is a 1953 book in German by [[Paul Hausser]], a former high-ranking [[Waffen-SS]] member and a leader of the Waffen-SS lobby group [[HIAG]]. As part of the organisation's [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|revisionist]] agenda, it advanced the idea of the purely military role of the Waffen-SS.{{sfn|Simpson|1990}}

The first major work by one of the HIAG leaders, it was published by {{Illm|Plesse Verlag|de|Plesse-Verlag}}, owned by a right-wing politician and publisher {{illm|Waldemar Schütz|de|Waldemar Schütz}}. Hausser's book, along with those by other key HIAG members [[Felix Steiner]] and [[Kurt Meyer]], has been characterised by the historian Charles Sydnor as one of the "most important works of [Waffen-SS] apologist literature."{{sfn|Sydnor|1990|p=319}}

== Background ==
From 1950, Hausser was active in [[HIAG]], a [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|revisionist]] organization and a [[advocacy group|lobby group]] of former [[Waffen-SS]] members. HIAG began in late 1950 as a loose association of local groups; by October 1951, it claimed to have 376 local branches. In December 1951, Hausser became its first spokesperson.{{sfn|Large|1987|pp=82–83}}

As part of its lobbying efforts, HIAG attempted to advance the idea of the Waffen-SS being the "fourth branch of the [[Wehrmacht]]" and in no way connected to the crimes of the regime.{{sfn|Large|1987|p=81}} HIAG's rewriting of history included significant multi-prong [[Propaganda|propaganda efforts]], including tendentious periodicals, books and public speeches, along with a publishing house – [[Munin Verlag]] – to serve as a platform for its publicity aims. The express aim of Munin Verlag was to publish the "war narratives" of former Waffen-SS members, in cooperation with HIAG.{{sfn|Wilke|2011|p=399}}{{sfn|MacKenzie|1997|p=138}}

== Contents ==
British [[military history|military historian]] [[Keith Simpson (politician)|Keith Simpson]] in his book ''Waffen SS'' quotes Hausser for writing that, he "hoped the work would disperse the lies and calumnies which had formed themselves around the Waffen-SS and help to give this courageous formation its place."{{sfn|Simpson|1990|p=6}} The book had an unmistakable connection to the Nazi origins of the Waffen-SS: the SS runes on the cover art and the SS motto ("my honor is my loyalty") embossed on the cloth cover. A foreword from the former Wehrmacht general [[Hans Guderian]] provided an endorsement for the Waffen-SS troops and referred to them as "the first realization of the European idea".{{sfn|MacKenzie|1997|pp=137–138}}

The book described the growth of Waffen-SS into a so-called multinational force where foreign volunteers fought heroically as a "militant example of the great European idea".{{sfn|MacKenzie|1997|pp=137–138}} Historians have refuted this characterisation, arguing that it was largely Nazi propaganda employed to bolster the ranks of the Waffen-SS with foreign volunteers. The message was later repurposed by HIAG as it sought historical and legal rehabilitation of the force.{{sfn|MacKenzie|1997|pp=137–138}}

Hausser wrote another book, published in 1966 by HIAG's imprint {{illm|Munin Verlag|de|Munin-Verlag}}, under the title ''Soldaten wie andere auch'' ("Soldiers Like Any Other"). According to the military historian [[Simon MacKenzie|S.P. MacKenzie]], the work epitomised how HIAG leaders wanted the Waffen-SS to be remembered, while the historian Charles Sydnor described it as "equally tendentious".{{sfn|MacKenzie|1997|p=137}}{{sfn|Sydnor|1973}}

== Reception ==
''Waffen-SS in Action'' was included in the index of objectionable war books maintained by West Germany's [[Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons]]. The index was created in the early 1960s to limit the sale of such works to minors due to their chauvinism and glorification of violence.{{sfn|Tauber Volume I|1967|p=539}}

Hausser's books, along with those by other key HIAG members and former Waffen-SS generals [[Felix Steiner]] and [[Kurt Meyer]], have been characterised by the historian Charles Sydnor as the "most important works of [Waffen-SS] apologist literature." These works demanded rehabilitation of the military branch of the Nazi Party and presented Waffen-SS members as both victims and misunderstood heroes.{{sfn|Sydnor|1990|p=319}}

'''Zev Vilnay''' ({{lang-he|זאב וילנאי}}, 1900–1988) was an Israeli [[geographer]], author and lecturer.

==Biography==
Volf Vilensky (later Zev Vilnay) was born in [[Kishinev]]. He [[aliyah|immigrated]] to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] with his parents at the age of six and grew up in [[Haifa]]. He served as a military [[topographer]] in the [[Haganah]], and later in the [[Israel Defense Forces]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;''Encyclopaedia Judaica'', "Zev Vilnay," Keter Publishing, Jerusalem, 1972, vol. 16, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;

Vilnay and his wife Esther lived in [[Jerusalem]]. One son, [[Matan Vilnai|Matan]] was a politician who served as a member of the Knesset and held several ministerial portfolios before becoming ambassador to [[China]]. Their eldest son is Oren Vilnay, an expert in structural Engineering who established a new department of Civil Engineering at [[Ben-Gurion University of the Negev]].

==Land of Israel studies==
[[File:Zev vilnay 1927 trip samaria.jpg|thumb|Tour of [[Samaria]] led by Zev Vilnay, 1927]]
Vilnay was a pioneer in the sphere of outdoor hiking and touring in Israel. Vilnay lectured widely on Israeli geography, ethnography, history and folklore.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; His ''Guide to Israel'' was published in 27 editions&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israeli-books.com/the_vilnay_guide_to_israel.asp The Vilnay Guide to Israel 2 vols&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704120808/http://www.israeli-books.com/the_vilnay_guide_to_israel.asp |date=July 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and translated into many languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE1DD1F39F930A15752C0A96E948260 | work=The New York Times | title=Zev Vilnay, Geographer, 87 | date=1988-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1974 edition of his guide, Vilnay describes how he helped bring back to Israel the boat of a British naval officer, [[Thomas Howard Molyneux]], who sailed the Jordan River from [[Lake Kinneret]] to the [[Dead Sea]] to map the region in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/919876.html 19th-century British explorer's boat returns to Dead Sea - Haaretz - Israel News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
