'''Aerial survey''' is a method of collecting [[geomatics]] or other [[image]]ry by using [[airplane]]s, [[helicopter]]s, [[unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV]]s, [[Balloon (aeronautics)|balloon]]s or other aerial methods. Typical types of data collected include [[aerial photography]], [[Lidar]], [[remote sensing]]  (using various visible and invisible bands of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], such as [[infrared]], [[gamma ray|gamma]], or [[ultraviolet]]) and also geophysical data (such as [[aeromagnetic survey]]s and [[gravity]]. It can also refer to the chart or map made by analysing a region from the air. Aerial survey should be distinguished from [[satellite imagery]] technologies because of its better resolution, quality and [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmospheric]] conditions (which can negatively impact and obscure [[Earth observation satellite|satellite observation]]). Today, aerial survey is sometimes recognized as a synonym for aerophotogrammetry, part of [[photogrammetry]] where the [[camera]] is placed in the air. Measurements on aerial images are provided by [[Photogrammetry|photogrammetric]] technologies and methods.&lt;ref&gt;A. Sechin. Digital Photogrammetric Systems: Trends and Developments. GeoInformatics. #4, 2014, pp. 32-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aerial surveys can provide information on many things not visible from the ground.

==Terms used in aerial survey==

;exposure station or air station: the position of the [[Cardinal point (optics)#Principal planes and points|optical centre]] of the camera at the moment of exposure.
;flying height:  the elevation of the exposure station above the datum (usually mean [[sea level]]).
;[[altitude]]: the vertical distance of the aircraft above the [[Earth]]'s surface.
;tilt: the angle between the aerial camera and the horizontal axis perpendicular to the [[Steady flight|line of flight]].
;tip: the angle between the aerial camera and the line of flight.
;principal point:  the point of intersection of the optical axis of the aerial camera with the [[Picture plane|photographical plane]].
;isocentre:  the point on the aerial photograph in which the bisector of the angle of tilt meets the photograph.
;[[nadir]] point: the image of the nadir, i.e. the point on the aerial photograph where a [[Plumb bob|plumbline]] dropped from the front nodal point pierces the photograph.
;scale: ratio of the [[focal length]] of the camera objective and the distance of the exposure station from the ground.
;[[azimuth]]: the clockwise horizontal angle measured about the ground [[nadir]] point from the ground survey [[North]] meridian in the plane of photograph.

==Uses==
Aerial surveys are used for:

Aerial surveys use a measuring camera where the elements of its interior orientation are known, but with much larger [[focal length]] and [[Photographic film|film]] and specialized [[Camera lens|lens]]es.

==Aerial survey sensors==
In order to carry out an aerial survey, a sensor needs to be fixed to the interior or the exterior of the airborne platform with line-of-sight to the target it is [[Remote sensing|remotely sensing]]. With manned [[aircraft]], this is accomplished either through an aperture in the [[Skin (aeronautics)|skin]] of the aircraft or mounted externally on a wing [[strut]]. With [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s (UAVs), the sensor is typically mounted under or inside.

Aerial survey systems are typically operated with the following:
* Flight navigation software, which directs the pilot to fly in the desired pattern for the survey.
* [[Satellite navigation|GNSS]], a combination of [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] and [[inertial measurement unit]] (IMU) to provide position and orientation information for the data recorded.
* [[Gyro-stabilized camera systems|Gyro-stabilized]] mount to counter the effects of aircraft roll, pitch and yaw.
* Data storage unit to save the data that is recorded.

* [[Leica Camera|Leica]] ADS100
* WaldoAir XCAM
* RIEGL LMS-Q780
* [[Trimble (company)Trimble]] AX80

'''Aethiopian Sea''', '''Æthiopian Ocean'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://ethiopia.limbo13.com/index.php/mapping_africa/ Road to Ethiopia]&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Æthiopic Ocean''' ({{lang-la|Æthiopicum Mare}} or ''Oceanus Æthiopicus''; {{lang-ar|البحر الأثيوبي}}) was the name given to the southern part of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in classical geographical works. The name appeared in maps from ancient times to the turn of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Rennel_map_1799.png 1799] [[James Rennell]] map with the Aethiopian Sea in the [[Gulf of Guinea]] area.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
{{see also|Aethiopia}}
The Ethiopian Sea, Ethiopic Ocean or Ethiopian Ocean (Okeanos Aithiopos), is an old name for what is now called the South Atlantic Ocean. It is separated from the North Atlantic Ocean by a narrow region between [[Natal, Rio Grande do Norte|Natal, Brazil]] and [[Monrovia, Liberia]]. The term Ethiopian Ocean appeared until the mid-19th century, for example on the map ''Accuratissima Totius Africae in Lucem Producta'', engraved by [[Johann Baptist Homann]] and [[Frederick de Wit]] and published by [[Jacob von Sandrart]] in [[Nürnberg]] in 1702.&lt;ref&gt;[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Accuratissima_Totius_Africae_in_Lucem_Producta,_by_Jacob_Sandrart,_Nurnberg,_1702,_engraved_by_Johann_Baptist_Homann_Sr._and_Frederick_de_Wit_-_Maps_of_Africa_-_Robert_C._Williams_Paper_Museum_-_DSC00605.JPG ''Accuratissima Totius Africae in Lucem Producta'' 1702 map]&lt;/ref&gt;

The name Aethiopian Sea to refer to the ocean was related to referring to large swathes of the continent of [[Africa]] as [[Aethiopia]]. Nowadays the classical use of the term has become obsolete, as the modern nation of [[Ethiopia]] is located in the northeastern area of Africa and not near the actual Ethiopic Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geocurrents.info/historical-geography/the-migration-of-place-names-africa-libya-ethiopia-eritrea-and-sudan The Migration of Place Names: Africa, Libya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Sudan]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:A new map of Africk, shewing its present general divisions cheif cities or towns, rivers, mountain &amp;c. (8250932292).jpg|thumb|270px|"[[Southern Ocean]]" as an alternative name for the Aethiopian Ocean in a 1700 map of Africa]]
[[Ancient Greek]] historians [[Diodorus]] and [[Palaephatus]] mentioned that the [[Gorgons]] lived in the [[Gorgades]], islands in the Aethiopian Sea. The main island was called Cerna and, according to [[Henry T. Riley]], these islands may correspond to [[Cape Verde]].&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''The Metamorphoses'', commented by Henry T. Riley {{ISBN|978-1-4209-3395-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16th century maps, the name of the Northern Atlantic Ocean was ''Sinus Occidentalis'', while the central Atlantic, southwest of present-day [[Liberia]], appeared as ''Sinus Atlanticus'' and the Southern Atlantic as ''Mare Aethiopicum''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/.../handbuchderozean01bogu_djvu.txt Georg Heinrich von Boguslawski, ''Handbuch der Ozeanographie'', 1907.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the 17th century [[John Seller]] divided the Atlantic Ocean in two parts by means of the [[equator]]. He named the northern portion of the Atlantic "Mar del Nort" and the southern part "Oceanus Æthiopicus" in his ''Atlas Maritimus'' published in 1672.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/atlasmaritimusor00sell Seller, John, fl. 1658-1698, ''Atlas maritimus, or A book of charts : Describeing the sea coasts capes headlands sands shoals rocks and dangers the bayes roads harbors rivers and ports, in most of the knowne parts of the world. With the true courses and distances, from one place to another : Gathered from the latest and best discoveryes, that have bin made by divers able and experienced navigators of our English nation : Accomodated with an hydrographicall description of the whole world.'']&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Wright (mathematician)|Edward Wright]] did not label the North Atlantic at all but called the portion south of the [[equator]] the "Aethiopian Sea" in a map that was published posthumously in 1683.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jcb.lunaimaging.com/luna/servlet/detail/JCBMAPS~1~1~1568~101920002:A-New-Mapp-of-the-World-According-t A New Mapp of the World According to Mr. Edward Wright Commonly called Mercator's-Projection.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Thornton (cartographer)|John Thornton]] used the term in "A New Map of the World" from 1703.&lt;ref&gt;Ian K. Steele, ''The English Atlantic, 1675-1740: An Exploration of Communication and Community'', Oxford, {{ISBN|978-0-19-503968-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Decades after the terms Ethiopian Ocean or Ethiopian Sea had fallen into disuse to refer to the Southern Atlantic Ocean, botanist [[William Albert Setchell]] (1864–1943) used the term for the sea around certain islands close to [[Antarctica]].&lt;ref&gt; Setchell, W. A. 1932. ''Macrocystis and its holdfasts.'' Univ. California Publ. Bot. 16: 445-492, in [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2436539 George F. Papenfuss, ''Studies of South African Phaeophyceae. I. Ecklonia maxima, Laminaria pallida, Macrocystis pyrifera'', American Journal of Botany, Vol. 29, No. 1 (Jan., 1942), pp. 15-24]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Age of Sail''' (usually dated as 1571–1862) was a period roughly corresponding to the [[early modern period]] in which [[international trade]] and [[naval warfare]] were dominated by [[sailing ship]]s, lasting from the 16th to the mid-19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hms-trincomalee.co.uk/history/the-age-of-sail |title=The Age of Sail |publisher=[[HMS Trincomalee|HMS ''Trincomalee'']] |accessdate=12 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316114603/http://www.hms-trincomalee.co.uk/history/the-age-of-sail |archive-date=2016-03-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Definition==
Like most [[History by period|periodic eras]] the definition is inexact but close enough to serve as a general description. The age of sail runs roughly from the [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)|Battle of Lepanto]] in 1571, the last significant engagement in which [[oar]]-propelled [[galley]]s played a major role, to the [[Battle of Hampton Roads]] in 1862, in which the steam-powered [[ironclad]] [[CSS Virginia|CSS ''Virginia'']] destroyed the sailing ships [[USS Cumberland (1842)|USS ''Cumberland'']] and [[USS Congress (1841)|USS ''Congress'']], demonstrating that the advance of [[steam power]] had rendered sail power in warfare obsolete.

The [[Suez Canal]], in the Middle-East, which opened in 1869, was impractical for sailing ships, and made steamboats faster on the [[European-Asian sea route]].

==Golden Age of Sail==
The period between 1850 and the early 20th century when sailing vessels reached their peak of size and complexity is sometimes referred to as the "Golden Age of Sail".&lt;ref&gt;[http://museum.gov.ns.ca/mma/AtoZ/rigs.html "Sailing Ship Rigs"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228161737/http://museum.gov.ns.ca/mma/AtoZ/rigs.html |date=2010-12-28 }}. [[Maritime Museum of the Atlantic]]&lt;/ref&gt; During this time the efficiency and use of commercial sailing vessels was at its peak&amp;mdash;immediately before [[steamboat]]s started to take trade away from sail.

==Decline==
Sailing ships sometimes continued to be an economical way to transport bulk cargo on long voyages into the 1920s, even if steamships also were used for such transports and became more and more common. Sailing ships do not require fuel or complex engines to be powered; thus they tended to be more independent from requiring a dedicated support base on the mainland. Crucially though, steam-powered ships held a speed advantage and were rarely hindered by adverse winds, freeing steam-powered vessels from the necessity of following [[trade wind]]s. As a result, cargo and supplies could reach a foreign port in half the time it took a sailing ship. 

Sailing vessels were pushed into narrower and narrower economic niches and gradually disappeared from commercial trade. Today, sailing vessels are only economically viable for small scale coastal fishing, along with recreational uses such as [[yachting]] and passenger sail excursion ships.

An '''arpent''' ({{IPA-fr|aʁpɑ̃}}) is a unit of [[length]] and a unit of [[area]]. It is a pre-[[Metric system|metric]] [[French units of measurement|French unit]] based on the Roman [[Ancient Roman units of measurement#Length|''actus'']]. It is used in [[Quebec]], some areas of the [[United States customary units|United States]] that were part of [[Louisiana (New France)|French Louisiana]], and in [[Mauritius]] and the [[Seychelles]].

==Etymology==

The word ''arpent'' is believed to derive from the [[Late Latin]] ''arepennis'' (equal to half a ''[[jugerum]]''), which in turn comes from the [[Gaulish]] *''are-penno''- ("end, extremity of a field").

==Unit of length==

There were various standard arpents. The most common were the arpent used in North America, which was defined as 180 [[Units of measurement in France before the French Revolution#Length|French feet]] (''{{lang|fr|pied}}'', of approximately {{convert|32.48|cm|in|disp=or}}), and the arpent used in Paris, which was defined as 220 French feet.

* In North America, 1 arpent = 180 French feet = about 192 [[English foot|English feet]] = about 58.47 [[metre]]s
* In Paris, 1 arpent = 220 French feet = about 234 English feet = about 71.46 metres

==Unit of area==

Historically, in North America, 1 (square) arpent (''{{lang|fr|arpent carré}}''), also known as a French acre, was 180 French feet × 180 French feet = 32,400 French square feet = about 3419 [[square metre]]s = about 0.845 English [[acre]]s.  Certain U.S. states have official definitions of the arpent which vary slightly:
* In [[Louisiana]], [[Mississippi]], [[Alabama]], and [[Florida]], the official conversion is 1 arpent = {{convert|0.84628|acre|m2|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref&gt;In Louisiana, an arpent is equal to approximately 0.84628 acre; see ''Derouen v. Poirier'', 136 So. 2d 131, footnote 1 (La. 3d Cir. Ct. App. 1961) (''dicta'').&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Arkansas]] and [[Missouri]], the official conversion is 1 arpent = {{convert|0.8507|acre|m2|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Glossary of Geology|editor1=Julia A. Jackson |editor2=James P. Mehl |editor3=Klaus K. E. Neuendorf |publisher=Springer|year=2005|isbn=9780922152766|page=37|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SfnSesBc-RgC&amp;pg=PA37}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Paris, the square arpent was 220 French feet × 220 French feet = 48,400 French square feet, about {{convert|5107|m2|acre|disp=or}}.

In Mauritius and Seychelles, an arpent is about 4220.87 [[square metre]]s, 0.4221 hectares, 1.043 acres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mauritius: Selected Issues and Statistical Appendix|publisher=International Monetary Fund|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=wqUP-8z25CoC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;dq=mauritius+arpent&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Q5ME0mHg9h&amp;sig=Q6Npl1Drm-w208E2RC_Y6jm6d_g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj9uIKjvYPWAhUHz2MKHcw9ApYQ6AEIWTAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=mauritius%20arpent&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Louisiana==
In Louisiana, parcels of land known as ''arpent'' sections or French ''arpent'' land grants also pre-date the [[Public Land Survey System]] (PLSS), but are treated as PLSS sections. An ''arpent'' is a French measurement of approximately {{convert|192|ft|m}}, and a square arpent (also referred to as an ''arpent'') is about {{convert|0.84|acre|m2}}.

French arpent land divisions are long narrow parcels of land, also called [[ribbon farm|ribbon farms]], usually found along the navigable streams of southern Louisiana, and also found along major waterways in other areas. This system of land subdivision was begun by French settlers in the 18th century, according to typical French practice at the time and was continued by both the Spanish and by the American government after the acquisition of the Louisiana Purchase. A typical French arpent land division is 2 to 4 arpents wide along the river by 40 to 60 arpents deep, while the Spanish arpent land divisions tend to be 6 to 8 arpents wide by 40 arpents deep.

This method of land division provided each land-owner with river frontage as well as land suitable for cultivation and habitation. These areas are given numbers just like standard sections, although the section numbers frequently exceed the normal upper limit of 36.&lt;ref name="natlatlas"&gt;[http://nationalatlas.gov/articles/boundaries/a_plss.html The Public Land Survey System (PLSS)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511182116/http://nationalatlas.gov/articles/boundaries/a_plss.html |date=2008-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Meridians-baselines.png|thumb|300px|right|This BLM map depicts the principal meridians and baselines used in the survey of the United States.]]
In '''[[surveying]]''', a baseline is a line between two points on the earth's surface and the direction and distance between them. In a triangulation network, at least one baseline needs to be measured to calculate the size of the triangles by trigonometry.

In the United States [[Public Land Survey System]], a '''baseline''' is the principal east-west line (i.e., a [[Circle of latitude|parallel]]) upon which all rectangular surveys in a defined area are based. The baseline meets its corresponding [[principal meridian]] at the point of origin, or ''[[initial point]]'', for the land survey. For example, the baseline for [[Nebraska]] and [[Kansas]] is shared as the border for both states, at the [[40th parallel north]].

More specifically a '''baseline''' may be the line that divides a [[survey township]] between north and south.

=="Baseline Road" in the United States==
Many communities in the United States have roads that run along survey baselines, many of which are named to reflect that fact. Some examples:

* In [[Little Rock]], [[Arkansas]], [[Arkansas Highway 338|Baseline Road]] follows the baseline used by surveyors of the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. 
* In [[Colorado]], [[Baseline Road (Colorado)|Baseline Road]] in [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]] marks the [[40th parallel north|40th parallel]], or the western extension of the Kansas-Nebraska boundary, which is also the boundary between [[Adams County, Colorado|Adams]] and [[Weld County, Colorado|Weld]] counties.  
* In [[Arizona]], the baseline near the [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] metro area is marked by [[Baseline Road (Arizona)|Baseline Road]]. 
* In Southern California, from Highland to San Dimas, the baseline is marked by [[Baseline Road (California)|Baseline Road]]. 
* In Michigan, the baseline for the [[Michigan Survey]] forms the boundary between the second and third tiers of counties and in many portions, discontinuous segments of road along the baseline are known as "[[Baseline Road (Michigan)|Baseline Road]]."  [[8 Mile Road]] in the [[Detroit]] area runs along the [[Michigan]] Baseline and was formerly known as "Baseline Road."  
* Baseline Road in Hillsboro, Oregon, generally follows the Willamette Baseline which intersects the Willamette Meridian at the [[Willamette_Stone|Willamette Stone State Park]].

==Canada==
In Canadian land surveying, a '''base line''' is one of the many principal east-west lines that correspond to four tiers of townships (two tiers north and two south). The base lines are about {{convert|24|mi|km}} apart, with the first base line at the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]], the western [[Canada–United States border|Canada–US border]]. It is, therefore equivalent to the ''standard parallel'' in the US system. In Ontario, a baseline forms a straight line parallel a geographical feature (mostly a lake, especially [[Lake Ontario]] or [[Lake Erie]]) that serves as a reference line for surveying a grid of property lots. The result of this surveying is the [[concession road|concession road and sideline]] system in use today.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1113">The '''Brussels Geographic Conference''' was held in [[Brussels]] [[Belgium]] in September 1876 at the request of King [[Leopold II of Belgium]]. At the conference were invited nearly forty well-known experts, mainly they were schooled in the geographic sciences or were wealthy [[philanthropist]]s. Before the guests returned to their respective countries, they voted to establish the [[International African Association]]. This initiative would in the end pave the way for the creation of [[Congo Free State]].

'''Schönburg Castle''' is in the municipality of Schönburg 4.5 kilometers east of [[Naumburg]] at the heart of [[Federal Republic of Germany]] in the State of [[Saxony-Anhalt]]. It has been proposed by Germany for inscription in the List of [[World Heritage]]. 

[[File:Schönburg Castle.jpg|thumb|Schönburg Castle in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany]]

== Location ==
The Late Romanesque ruins of Schönburg Castle are on top of a mottled sandstone cliff by the [[Saale]] River, which is 40 metres high and declines sharply in the west. The castle was built with the local mottled [[sandstone]].

== History ==
The castle on top of the southern slopes of the Saale was erected as the most important castle in the 12th century on commission by the [[bishops]] of Naumburg. The bishops owned several castles within their territory to secure their assets. From 1158 at the latest, a free [[noble family]] that owned property around [[Naumburg]] named itself after the castle. It was first documented in 1137. Schönburg has been preserved to this day and is an example from the time of classical [[castle]] construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Zur Geschichte und Baugeschichte der Schönburg, Burgenlandkreis.

''In:'' Castles and palaces in Saxony-Anhalt.|page=15-79|author=Schmitt, Reinhard|publisher=Saxony-Anhalt|date=2003|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Architecture ==
All the walls, gates and parts of the [[Palas]] have retained their original substance from the High Middle Ages, as have parts of the interior like visible [[chimneys]] dated to 1220 and decorated windows. The [[architecture]] and decorations found here correspond to other monuments in the World Heritage nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Die Schönburg. Bischofsburg zu Naumburg.

The amended version of the history of Schöburg since 1036.|page=15-79|author=Baumgart, Uwe|publisher=Naumburg|date=1997|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== World Heritage Nomination ==
Schönburg Castle is one of the eleven components of the cultural landscape “[[Naumburg Cathedral and the High Medieval Cultural Landscape of the Rivers Saale and Unstrut]]”. As a landmark the castle is an important part of the lines of sight connecting the [[cultural landscape]] as a whole.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The Förderverein Welterbe an Saale und Unstrut e.V. is the coordinating body for this nomination: http://www.naumburg-cathedral.de/.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clairaut's theorem''' is a general mathematical law giving the surface gravity on a viscous rotating [[ellipsoid]] in equilibrium under the action of its gravitational field and centrifugal force.  It was published in 1743 by [[Alexis Clairaut|Alexis Claude Clairaut]] in his ''Théorie de la figure de la terre, tirée des principes de l'hydrostatique'' (''Theory of the shape of the earth, drawn from the principles of hydrostatics'')&lt;ref name=RoyalSoc&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3owAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA134&amp;lpg=PA134&amp;dq=%22Th%C3%A9orie+de+la+figure+de+la+terre%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=an0JW-H3C8&amp;sig=BMkuXfZEsK3p0tzrZ1Jvfcy7hmw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ct=result From the catalogue of the scientific books in the library of the Royal Society.]&lt;/ref&gt; which synthesized physical and geodetic evidence that the Earth is an oblate rotational [[ellipsoid]].&lt;ref name= Torge&gt;{{cite book |title=Geodesy: An Introduction |edition=3rd |author=Wolfgang Torge |page=10 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pFO6VB_czRYC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;dq=%22Clairaut%27s+theorem%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;sig=ACfU3U34GaPhl4tA9duUMLQpm77hiKb-RQ#PPA10,M1 |isbn=3-11-017072-8 |year=2001 |publisher=[[Walter de Gruyter]]   }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Routh&gt;{{cite book |author=Edward John Routh |title=A Treatise on Analytical Statics with Numerous Examples |page=154  |year=2001|isbn=1-4021-7320-2 |publisher=Adamant Media Corporation |volume=Vol. 2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yKmdk4LZxhMC&amp;pg=RA1-PA40&amp;dq=isbn=1-4021-7320-2&amp;sig=ACfU3U2uhAKDJtIYZEY-Jf-1e5wf7UgG1w#PPA154,M1 }} A reprint of the original work published in 1908 by Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially used to relate the gravity at any point on the Earth's surface to the position of that point, allowing the [[ellipticity]] of the Earth to be calculated from measurements of gravity at different latitudes.  Today it has been largely supplanted by the [[Somigliana equation]].

== History ==
Although it had been known since antiquity that the Earth was spherical, by the 17th century evidence was accumulating that it was not a perfect sphere.   In 1672 [[Jean Richer]] found the first evidence that gravity was not constant over the Earth (as it would be if the Earth were a sphere); he took a [[pendulum clock]] to [[Cayenne]], [[French Guiana]] and found that it lost {{frac|2|1|2}} minutes per day compared to its rate at Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Pendulum gravimeters began to be taken on voyages to remote parts of the world, and it was slowly discovered that gravity increases smoothly with increasing latitude, gravitational acceleration being about 0.5% greater at the poles than at the equator.

British physicist [[Isaac Newton]] explained this in his ''[[Principia Mathematica Philosophiae Naturalis|Principia Mathematica]]'' (1687) in which he outlined his theory and calculations on the shape of the Earth.  Newton theorized correctly that the Earth was not precisely a sphere but had an [[oblate]] [[ellipsoid]]al shape, slightly flattened at the poles due to the [[centrifugal force]] of its rotation.  Since the surface of the Earth is closer to its center at the poles than at the equator, gravity is stronger there.  Using geometric calculations, he gave a concrete argument as to the hypothetical ellipsoid shape of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Principia, Book III, Proposition XIX, Problem III|last = Newton|first = Isaac|publisher =|year =|isbn =|location =|pages =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of ''[[Principia Mathematica Philosophiae Naturalis|Principia]]'' was not to provide exact answer for natural phenomena, but to theorize potential solutions to these unresolved factors in science.  Newton pushed for scientists to look further into the unexplained variables. Two prominent researchers that he inspired were [[Alexis Clairaut]] and [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]]. They both sought to prove the validity of Newton's theory on the shape of the Earth. In order to do so, they went on an expedition to [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]] in an attempt to accurately measure the [[meridian arc]].  From such measurements they could calculate the [[eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]] of the Earth, its degree of departure from a perfect sphere.   Clairaut confirmed that Newton's theory that the Earth was ellipsoidal was correct, but his calculations were in error, and wrote a letter to the [[Royal Society|Royal Society of London]] with his findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Problem of the Earth's Shape from Newton to Clairaut|last = Greenburg|first = John|publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]|year = 1995|isbn = 0-521-38541-5|location = New York|pages = 132}}&lt;/ref&gt; The society published an article in [[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|Philosophical Transactions]] the following year in 1737 that revealed his discovery. Clairaut showed how Newton's equations were incorrect, and did not prove an ellipsoid shape to the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Clairaut|first = Alexis|last2 = Colson|first2 = John|date = 1737|title = An Inquiry concerning the Figure of Such Planets as Revolve about an Axis, Supposing the Density Continually to Vary, from the Centre towards the Surface|jstor = 103921|journal = Philosophical Transactions|doi =|pmid =}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he corrected problems with the theory, that in effect would prove Newton's theory correct. Clairaut believed that Newton had reasons for choosing the shape that he did, but he did not support it in ''[[Principia Mathematica Philosophiae Naturalis|Principia]].'' Clairaut's article did not provide an valid equation to back up his argument as well. This created much controversy in the scientific community.

It was not until Clairaut wrote ''Théorie de la figure de la terre'' in 1743 that a proper answer was provided. In it, he promulgated what is more formally known today as Clairaut's theorem.

==Formula==
Clairaut's formula for the acceleration due to gravity ''g'' on the surface of a spheroid at latitude φ, was:&lt;ref name=Ball&gt;[http://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/HistMath/People/Clairaut/RouseBall/RB_Clairaut.html  W.

:&lt;math&gt;   g(\varphi) = \mathbb{G}_e \left[ 1 + \left(\frac{5}{2} m - f\right) \sin^2 \varphi \right] \ , &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G}_e&lt;/math&gt; is the value of the acceleration of gravity at the equator, ''m'' the ratio of the centrifugal force to gravity at the equator, and ''f'' the [[flattening]] of a [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] section of the earth, defined as:
:&lt;math&gt;f = \frac {a-b}{a} \ , &lt;/math&gt;
(where ''a'' = semimajor axis, ''b'' = semiminor axis).

Clairaut derived the formula under the assumption that the body was composed of concentric coaxial spheroidal layers of constant density.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[File:Glastonbury (part of) from the tor arp.jpg|thumb|[[Glastonbury]], [[Somerset]], a dry point settlement, looking west from the top of [[Glastonbury Tor]]. The fields in the distance are the [[Somerset Levels]], where winter flooding is frequent.]]

In [[geography]], a '''dry point''' is an area of firm or [[flood]]-free ground in an area of [[wetland]], [[marsh]] or [[flood plain]]s.  The term typically applies to settlements, and dry point settlements were common in history.

In the [[United Kingdom]] extreme examples of dry point settlements include [[Glastonbury]], situated on a low hill in the marshy, and once frequently flooded, [[Somerset Levels]], and [[Wareham, Dorset|Wareham]] in [[Dorset]] surrounded by flood plains to the west and [[Poole Harbour]] to the east.

A dry point has the advantages of flood protection, fertile soil (due to previous floodings which would have deposited silt on the land) and fairly flat land which is ideal for agriculture and building.

'''GSHHG''' ('''Global Self-consistent, Hierarchical, High-resolution Geography Database'''; formerly ''Global Self-consistent, Hierarchical, High-resolution Shoreline Database'' (''GSHHS'')) is a high-resolution shoreline data set amalgamated from two data bases (the CIA world database WDBII, and the World Vector Shoreline database) in the public domain. The data have undergone extensive processing and are free of internal inconsistencies such as [[erratic point]]s and crossing segments. The shorelines are constructed entirely from hierarchically arranged closed polygons. The four-level hierarchy is as follows: seashore, lakes, islands within lakes, ponds within islands within lakes.

The data can be used to simplify data searches and data selections, or to study the statistical characteristics of shorelines and land-masses. It comes with access software and routines to facilitate decimation based on a standard line-reduction algorithm.

GSHHS is developed and maintained by [[Paul Wessel (geophysicist)|Dr. Paul Wessel]] at the [[University of Hawai'i]], and Dr. Walter H. F. Smith at the [[NOAA Laboratory for Satellite Altimetry]].

==History==
The term "geo-literacy" arose from the National Geographic Society's "Fight against Geographic Illiteracy." The organization released various media to help explain the concept to the general public. In an editorial, Daniel C. Edelson, vice president for education at National Geographic, said, "The National Geographic Society's concern for geo-literacy comes from our mission. We see geo-literacy as providing the tools that will enable communities to protect [[natural resource|natural]] and cultural resources, reduce violent [[Armed conflict|conflict]], and improve the [[quality of life]] worldwide. However, having a geo-literate populace is also critical for maintaining [[Competition (economics)|economic competitiveness]], quality of life, and national security in our modern, interconnected world.",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://geography.about.com/b/2012/05/13/geo-literacy.htm | title=Geo-Literacy | publisher=About.com | date=May 13, 2012 | accessdate=June 26, 2012 | author=Rosenberg, Matt}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have released various media to help explain it to the general public.&lt;ref name="nationalgeographic1"/&gt; In addition, the National Geographic Society set up the Fund for Geo-literacy, in which donations help fund the printing of materials for education, professional development for the educators, and programs to help build awareness of the importance of geo-literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.nationalgeographic.com/education/program/fund-for-geo-literacy/?ar_a=1&amp;force_AR=True |title=Fund for Geo-Literacy |accessdate=June 26, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625130105/http://education.nationalgeographic.com/education/program/fund-for-geo-literacy/?ar_a=1 |archivedate=June 25, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components==
According to Edelson, the 3 components of geo-literacy are:&lt;ref name="nationalgeographic1"/&gt;
* Interactions-Understanding of human and natural systems
* Interconnections-Geographic reasoning
* Implications-Systematic decision-making

==Educational activities==
"Kid World Citizen", a site which provides "multicultural, educational activities to teach...kids about the world", and who, listed the following "age-appropriate lessons to increase geo-literacy in primary school students":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kidworldcitizen.org/2012/05/13/what-is-geo-literacy/ | title=What is Geo-Literacy? | publisher=Kid World Citizen | date=May 13, 2012 | accessdate=June 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Explore different homes around the world and guess why the types of home fit their environment
* Discover why certain cultures celebrate certain holidays, and what is important to them
* Investigate different [[habitats]] and [[biomes]], such as the [[rainforest]]; look at tangible ways kids can prevent their destruction
* Surround kids with geography: study maps, [[cartography|create maps]], follow maps, play with maps. The more you develop their spatial intelligence when they’re younger, the more kids will understand their place in this world.
* Learn about the [[water cycle]] and the conserving and managing our freshwater resources
* Research your child’s favorite animal, turning it into a global lesson about protecting their habitat and food sources; what decisions can we make that will affect the outcome of this animal?

==Research Studies and Education Projects==
In 2012, InTeGrate ("a community effort to improve geoscience literacy and build a workforce that can make use of geoscience to solve societal issues") held a Module Author Meeting from May 16–18 on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://serc.carleton.edu/integrate/info_team_members/meetings/geo_lit_agenda.html | title=Module Author Meeting Agenda | accessdate=June 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Earlier Uses of the Term "geo-literacy"==

In 2002, Robert E. Nolan of the [[Education Resources Information Center]] published a research report/journal article entitled "Geo-Literacy: How Well Adults Understand the World in Which They Live", which included  "a test of physical and geopolitical geography...completed by 321 adults". The years of formal education and age were correlated with geographic literacy, and informal learning, such as travel, reading, media, was used as the primary source of geographic knowledge for those with higher educational attainment. A notable finding was that women, regardless of education level, scored significantly lower than men."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ658647&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ658647 | title=Geo-Literacy: How Well Adults Understand the World in Which They Live | accessdate=June 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the [[Arizona Geographic Information Council|Arizona Geographic Alliance]] launched a project called "The GeoLiteracy Project" that integrated geography education into reading and writing instruction.  In this case, their term "GeoLiteracy" referred to the integration of geography and traditional language arts literacy. 

In 1997, Linda Ferguson and Eva LaMar established an educational project they called "The Geo-Literacy Project".  LaMar describes geo-literacy as "the use of visual learning and communication tools to build an in-depth understanding -- or literacy -- of geography, [[geology]], and local [[history]]." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ball|first=Ashley|title=Geo-Literacy: Using Technology to Forge New Ground|url=http://www.edutopia.org/geo-literacy-forging-new-ground|work=Edutopia|accessdate=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''GeoTime''' is [[geospatial analysis]] software that allows the visual analysis of events over time. It adds time as the [[third dimension]] to a [[two-dimensional]] map (which can include [[3D projection]] of terrain [[elevation]] [[geodata]] or any abstract diagrammatic space), allowing users to see changes within [[time series]] data. Users can view real-time animated playback of data and use automated analysis tools within the software to identify location patterns, connections between events, and trends.&lt;ref name="overview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oculusinfo.com/geotime/ |title=GeoTime Overview - Oculus |publisher=Oculus Info Inc. |accessdate=29 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

GeoTime can import data in many formats, such as [[GPS eXchange Format|GPX]], [[Shapefile]], [[KML]], [[Microsoft Excel]], [[Comma-separated values|CSV]], [[geotagged photo]]s, and from live data sources via [[GeoRSS]] and [[RSS]] web feeds and [[Web Map Service|WMS]] servers. It supports most [[Telecommunications data retention|telecommunication carrier reporting]] formats ([[Call detail record|CDR]]), including tower/sector information. These features allow users to aggregate data from [[satellite]]s, [[mobile phone]]s, [[social networking]] web sites, [[web server]] logs and many other sources. GeoTime can export data to other [[GIS software]] such as [[Google Earth]] and [[Environmental Systems Research Institute|ESRI]] [[ArcGIS]] via [[KML]] format, and to other applications via [[Comma-separated values|CSV]], as well as capture [[video]] of data animations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geotime.com/Product/GeoTime-%281%29/Features---Benefits/Features---Benefits-%281%29.aspx |title=GeoTime: Features |publisher=Oculus Info Inc. |accessdate=29 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511031801/http://www.geotime.com/Product/GeoTime-(1)/Features---Benefits/Features---Benefits-(1).aspx |archivedate=11 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[ArcGIS#Extensions|ArcGIS extension]] is available that allows GeoTime to work alongside the popular ArcGIS [[geographic information system]] with bi-directional data sharing between the two programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geotime.com/Product/GeoTime-%281%29/GeoTime-for-ArcGIS.aspx |title=GeoTime for ArcGIS |publisher=Oculus Info Inc. |accessdate=29 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601114817/http://www.geotime.com/Product/GeoTime-(1)/GeoTime-for-ArcGIS.aspx |archivedate=1 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oculusinfo.com/geotime-arcgis-compatibility/ |title=GeoTime ArcGIS Compatibility |publisher=Oculus Info Inc. |accessdate=29 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''geo URI scheme''' is a [[Uniform Resource Identifier]] (URI) scheme defined by the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]]'s RFC 5870 (published 8 June 2010)&lt;ref name="RFC5870"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5870|title=RFC 5870 - A Uniform Resource Identifier for Geographic Locations (geo URI)|date=2010-06-08|publisher=Internet Engineering Task Force|accessdate=9 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for geographic locations using the 'geo' [[URI scheme|scheme name]].  A 'geo' URI identifies a physical location in a two- or three-dimensional [[Spatial referencing system|coordinate reference system]] in a compact, simple, human-readable, and [[Communications protocol|protocol]]-independent way.&lt;ref name="RFC5870" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The current revision of the [[vCard]] specification&lt;ref name="RFC6350"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6350|title=RFC 6350 - vCard Format Specification|date=2011-08-11|publisher=Internet Engineering Task Force|accessdate=19 Jun 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; supports geo URIs in a vCard's "GEO" property, and the [[GeoSMS]] standard uses geo URIs for [[geotagging]] SMS messages. [[Android (operating system)|Android]] based devices support geo URIs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://developer.android.com/guide/appendix/g-app-intents.html|title=Android Intents List|publisher=google.com|date=|accessdate=2012-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; although that implementation is based on a draft revision of the specification, and supports a different set of URI parameters and query strings.

A geo URI is not to be confused with the site GeoUrl&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geourl.org/ |title=Geourl.org |publisher=Geourl.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227152230/http://geourl.org/ |archivedate=2011-12-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (which implements [[ICBM address]]).

==Example ==

A simple geo URI might look like:

:&lt;code&gt;geo:37.786971,-122.399677&lt;/code&gt;

where the two numerical values represent [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] respectively,&lt;ref name="RFC5870" /&gt; and are separated by a [[comma]].&lt;ref name="RFC5870" /&gt; They are coordinates of an [[Horizontal position representation|horizontal grid]] (2D). If a third comma-separated value is present, it represents [[altitude]];&lt;ref name="RFC5870" /&gt; so, coordinates of a 3D  grid.  Coordinates in the Southern and Western hemispheres as well as altitudes below the coordinate reference system (depths) are signed negative with a leading dash.&lt;ref name="RFC5870" /&gt; 

The geo URI also allows for an optional "uncertainty" value, separated by a [[semicolon]], representing the uncertainty of the location in meters, and is described using the "u" URI parameter.&lt;ref name="RFC5870" /&gt; A geo URI with an uncertainty parameter looks as follows:

:&lt;code&gt;geo:37.786971,-122.399677;u=35&lt;/code&gt;

A geo URI may, for example, be included on a web page, as [[HTML]]:

:&lt;code&gt;&lt;a href="geo:37.786971,-122.399677;u=35"&gt;Wikimedia Headquarters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

so that a geo URI-aware [[user agent]] such as a [[web browser]] could launch the user's chosen mapping service; or it could be used in an [[Atom (standard)|Atom]] feed or other [[XML]] file.

== Coordinate reference systems ==

The values of the coordinates only make sense when a [[coordinate reference system]] (CRS) is specified. The default CRS is the [[World Geodetic System|World Geodetic System 1984]] (WGS-84),&lt;ref name="RFC5870" /&gt; and it is not recommended to use any other:

{{quote| The optional 'crs' URI parameter described below may be used by future specifications to define the use of CRSes other than WGS-84. This is primarily intended to cope with the case of another CRS  replacing WGS-84 as the predominantly used one, rather than allowing the arbitrary use of thousands of CRSes for the URI (which would clearly affect interoperability).&lt;ref name="RFC5870" /&gt;
}}

The only justified use of other CRS today is, perhaps, to preserve projection in [[Scale_(map)#Large-scale_maps_with_curvature_neglected|large-scale maps]], as local [[Universal_Transverse_Mercator_coordinate_system|UTM]], or for non-terrestrial coordinates such as those on [[Moon|the Moon]] or [[Mars]].  The syntax and semantic of the CRS parameter, separated by a semicolon, is described at section 8.3 of RFC&amp;nbsp;5870. Examples:

* The [[Washington Monument]]'s location  expressed with [[Universal_Transverse_Mercator_coordinate_system#UTM_zone|UTM-zone 18S]] and its [http://www.spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/wgs-84-utm-zone-18s/ standard ID]:
*: &lt;code&gt;geo:323482,4306480;crs=EPSG:32718;u=20&lt;/code&gt;
* A geo URI for a hypothetical lunar CRS created in 2011 might be:
*: &lt;code&gt;geo:37.786971,-122.399677;crs=Moon-2011;u=35&lt;/code&gt;

The order in which the semicolon-separated parameters occur is partially significant.&lt;ref name="RFC5870" /&gt; Whilst the labeltext parameter and future parameters may be given in any order, the &lt;code&gt;crs&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt; parameters must come first. If both are used, the &lt;code&gt;crs&lt;/code&gt; must precede the &lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref name="RFC5870" /&gt; All parameters are [[Case sensitivity|case-insensitive]],&lt;ref name="RFC5870" /&gt; so, imagining a future new parameter &lt;code&gt;mapcolors&lt;/code&gt;, it can be ignored by simpler applications, and the above example is exactly equivalent to:
: &lt;code&gt;geo:323482,4306480;CRS=epsg:32718;U=20;mapcolors=for_daltonic&lt;/code&gt;
Being in doubt, remember that use of the lowercase representation of parameter names (&lt;code&gt;crs&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;mapcolors&lt;/code&gt;) is preferred.

A '''geodetic control network''' (also '''geodetic network''', '''reference network''', '''control point network''', or '''control network''') is a network, often of [[triangle]]s, which are measured precisely by techniques of terrestrial [[surveying]] or by [[satellite geodesy]].

A geodetic control network consists of stable, identifiable points with published datum values derived from observations that tie the points together.&lt;ref&gt;
Rear Adm. John D. Bossler.
[http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/FGCS/tech_pub/1984-stds-specs-geodetic-control-networks.htm "Standards and Specifications for Geodetic Control Networks"].
1984.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Classically, a control is divided into horizontal (X-Y) and vertical (Z) controls (components of the control), however with the advent of [[satellite navigation]] systems, [[GPS]] in particular, this division is becoming obsolete.

Many organizations contribute information to the geodetic control network.&lt;ref&gt;
Minnesota Geospatial Information Office.
[http://www.mngeo.state.mn.us/MSDI/workgroups/geodetic.htm "MSDI Data: Geodetic Control"].
&lt;/ref&gt;

The higher-order (high precision, usually millimeter-to-decimeter on a scale of continents) control points are normally defined in both space and time using global or space techniques, and are used for "lower-order" points to be tied into. The lower-order control points are normally used for [[engineering]], [[construction]] and [[navigation]]. The scientific discipline that deals with the establishing of coordinates of points in a high-order control network is called [[geodesy]], and the technical discipline that does the same for points in a low-order control network is called [[surveying]].

== Cartography ==
After a cartographer registers key points in a digital map to the real world coordinates of those points on the ground, the map is then said to be "in control". Having a base map and other data in geodetic control means that they will overlay correctly.

When map layers are not in control, it requires extra work to adjust them to line up, which introduces additional error.
Those real world coordinates are generally in some particular [[map projection]], unit, and [[geodetic datum]].&lt;ref&gt;
Minnesota Geospatial Information Office.
[http://www.mngeo.state.mn.us/committee/cadastral/iisac/plan2.html "Plan for GIS implementation"].
1997.
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Triangulation ==
{{main article|Triangulation}}
In "classical geodesy" (up to the sixties) control networks were established by [[triangulation]] using measurements of [[angle]]s and of some spare distances.  The precise orientation to the [[geographic north]] is achieved through methods of [[geodetic astronomy]]. The principal instruments used are [[theodolite]]s and [[tacheometer]]s, which nowadays are equipped with [[infrared]] distance measuring, [[data base]]s, communication systems and partly by satellite links.

== Trilateration ==
{{see also|Trilateration}}
[[Electronic distance measurement]] (EDM) was introduced around 1960, when the [[prototype]] instruments became small enough to be used in the field. Instead of using only sparse and much less accurate distance measurements some control networks was established or updated by using [[trilateration]] more accurate distance measurements than was previously possible and no angle measurements.

EDM increased network [[accuracy|accuracies]] up to 1:1 million (1&amp;nbsp;cm per 10&amp;nbsp;km; today at least 10 times better), and made surveying less costly.

== Satellite geodesy ==
{{main article|Satellite geodesy}}
The geodetic use of [[satellite]]s began around the same time. By using bright satellites like [[Echo satellite#Echo 1|Echo I]], [[Echo satellite#Echo 2|Echo II]] and [[Pageos]], global networks were determined, which later provided support for the theory of [[plate tectonics]].

Another important improvement was the introduction of [[radio]] and electronic satellites like [[GEOS (satellite)|Geos A]] and B (1965–70), of the [[Transit (satellite)|Transit]] system ([[Doppler effect]]) 1967-1990 &amp;mdash; which was the predecessor of GPS - and of [[laser]] techniques like [[Lageos]] (USA) or [[Starlette]] (F). Despite the use of spacecraft, small networks for [[cadastral]] and [[Technology|technical]] projects are mainly measured terrestrially, but in many cases incorporated in national and global networks by satellite geodesy.

== Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) ==
{{see also|Satellite navigation}}
Nowadays, several hundred geodetic satellites are in orbit, supplemented by a large number of [[remote sensing]] satellites and [[navigation]] systems like [[GPS]] and [[Glonass]], which will be followed by the European [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo]] satellites in 2020.

While these developments have made satellite-based geodetic network surveying more flexible and cost effective than its terrestrial equivalent, the continued existence of [[Benchmark (surveying)|fixed point]] networks is still needed for administrative and legal purposes on local and regional scales. Global geodetic networks cannot be defined to be fixed, since [[geodynamic]]s are continuously changing the position of all [[continent]]s by 2 to 20&amp;nbsp;cm per year. Therefore, modern global networks like [[ETRS89]] or [[International Terrestrial Reference System|ITRF]] show not only [[coordinate]]s of their "fixed points", but also their annual [[velocity|velocities]].

'''Geographic information retrieval (GIR)''' or '''geographical information retrieval''' is the augmentation of [[information retrieval]] with geographic information. GIR aims at solving textual queries that include a geographic dimension, such as "What wars were fought in Greece?" or "restaurants in Beirut".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Geographic Information Retrieval|url = http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2047296.2047297|journal = SIGSPATIAL Special|date = 2011-07-01|issn = 1946-7729|pages = 2–4|volume = 3|issue = 2|doi = 10.1145/2047296.2047297|first = Ross|last = Purves|first2 = Christopher|last2 = Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is common in GIR to separate the text indexing and analysis from the geographic indexing. [[Semantic similarity]] and [[word-sense disambiguation]] are important components of GIR.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The semantics of similarity in geographic information retrieval {{!}} Janowicz {{!}} Journal of Spatial Information Science|url = http://josis.net/index.php/josis/article/viewArticle/26|website = josis.net|accessdate = 2015-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; To identify place names, GIR often relies on [[Gazetteer|gazetteers]].

== GIR architecture ==
GIR involves extracting and resolving the meaning of locations in unstructured text.  This is known as [[Geoparsing]]. After identifying location references in text, a GIR system must index this information for search and retrieval. GIR systems can commonly be broken down into the following stages: [[GeoTagging]], text and geographic indexing, data storage, geographic relevance ranking (with respect to a geographic query) and browsing results (commonly with a map interface).

== Evaluation ==

In 2005 the [[Cross-Language Evaluation Forum]] added a geographic track, GeoCLEF.

A '''geographical cluster''' is a localised [[:wikt:anomaly|anomaly]], usually an excess of something given the [[spatial distribution|distribution]] or variation of something else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often it is considered as an [[incidence rate]] that is unusual in that there is more of some variable than might be expected. Examples would include: a local excess disease rate, a crime hot spot, areas of high unemployment, [[accident blackspot]]s, unusually high positive residuals from a model, high concentrations of flora or fauna, physical features or events like earthquake epicenters etc... {{Fact|date=July 2014}}

Identifying these extreme regions may be useful in that there could be implicit geographical associations with other variables that can be identified and would be of interest. Pattern detection via the identification of such geographical clusters is a very simple and generic form of geographical analysis that has many applications in many different contexts. The emphasis is on localized clustering or patterning because this may well contain the most useful information.  {{Fact|date=July 2014}}

A geographical cluster is different from a high concentration as it is generally second order, involving the factoring in of the distribution of something else. {{Fact|date=July 2014}}

==Geographical cluster detection==
Identifying geographical clusters can be an important stage in a geographical analysis. Mapping the locations of unusual concentrations may help identify causes of these. Some techniques include the Geographical Analysis Machine and Besag and Newell's cluster detection method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fotheringham|first1=A. Stewart|last2=Zhan|first2=F.

'''Geohash''' is a [[public domain]] [[geocoding]] system invented by Gustavo Niemeyer&lt;ref&gt;
Evidences at the [[Wayback Machine]] (also with  [https://web.archive.org/web/20080305090620/http://en.wikipedia.org:80/wiki/Geohash 2008's records of this article]):
* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080305223755/http://blog.labix.org:80/#post-85 labix.org in 2008, the G. Niemeyer's blog announcing Geohash];
*  [https://web.archive.org/web/20120112004608/http://www.bigfastblog.com:80/geohash-intro an article about Geohash witnessing and citing G. Niemeyer works, before 2012];
* [https://web.archive.org/web/20180309054335/https://forums.geocaching.com/GC/index.php?/topic/186412-geohashorg/ G. Niemeyer's post at forums.geocaching.com announcing Geohash in Feb. 2008].
&lt;/ref&gt;, which encodes a geographic location into a short string of letters and digits. It is a hierarchical spatial data structure which subdivides space into buckets of [[Grid (spatial index)|grid]] shape, which is one of the many applications of what is known as a [[Z-order curve]], and generally [[space-filling curves]].

Geohashes offer properties like arbitrary precision and the possibility of gradually removing characters from the end of the code to reduce its size (and gradually lose precision). As a consequence of the gradual precision degradation, nearby places will often (but not always) present similar prefixes. The longer a shared prefix is, the closer the two places are.

== Web site geohash.org ==

In February 2008, together with the announcement of the system, the inventor launched the website http://geohash.org/, which allows users to convert geographic coordinates to short [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]]s which uniquely identify positions on the [[Earth]], so that referencing them in [[email]]s, [[Internet forum|forums]], and [[website]]s is more convenient.

To obtain the Geohash, the user provides an address to be [[geocode]]d, or [[latitude and longitude]] coordinates, in a single input box (most commonly used formats for latitude and longitude pairs are accepted), and performs the request.

Besides showing the latitude and longitude corresponding to the given Geohash, users who navigate to a Geohash at geohash.org are also presented with an embedded map, and may download a [[GPX (data transfer)|GPX]] file, or transfer the waypoint directly to certain [[GPS]] receivers.  Links are also provided to external sites that may provide further details around the specified
location.

For example, the coordinate pair &lt;code&gt;57.64911,10.40744&lt;/code&gt; (near the tip of the [[peninsula]] of [[Jutland, Denmark]]) produces a slightly shorter hash of &lt;code&gt;u4pruydqqvj&lt;/code&gt;.

== Uses ==

The main usages of Geohashes are:

* As a unique identifier.
* To represent point data, e.g. in databases.

Geohashes have also been proposed to be used for [[geotagging]].

When used in a database, the structure of geohashed data has two advantages. First, data indexed by geohash will have all points for a given rectangular area in contiguous slices (the number of slices depends on the precision required and the presence of geohash "fault lines"). This is especially useful in database systems where queries on a single index are much easier or faster than multiple-index queries. Second, this index structure can be used for a quick-and-dirty proximity search: the closest points are often among the closest geohashes.

== Algorithm and example ==

Using the hash &lt;code&gt;ezs42&lt;/code&gt; as an example, here is how it is decoded into a decimal latitude and longitude

The first step is decoding it from [[Base32|base 32]] using the following character map:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|-
! Decimal
| 0 || 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7 || 8 || 9 || 10 || 11 || 12 || 13 || 14 || 15
|-
! Base 32
| 0 || 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7 || 8 || 9 ||  b ||  c ||  d ||  e ||  f ||  g
|-
| style="font: 0.5em/0.5em serif;" colspan="20" | &amp;nbsp;
|-
! Decimal
| 16 || 17 || 18 || 19 || 20 || 21 || 22 || 23 || 24 || 25 || 26 || 27 || 28 || 29 || 30 || 31
|-
! Base 32
|  h ||  j ||  k ||  m ||  n ||  p ||  q ||  r ||  s ||  t ||  u ||  v ||  w ||  x ||  y ||  z
|}

This operation results in the [[bit]]s 01101 11111 11000 00100 00010.  Assuming that counting starts at 0 in the left side, the even bits are taken for the longitude code (0111110000000), while the odd bits are taken for the latitude code (101111001001).

Each binary code is then used in a series of divisions, considering one bit at a time, again from the left to the right side.  For the latitude value, the interval -90 to +90 is divided by 2, producing two intervals: -90 to 0, and 0 to +90.  Since the first bit is 1, the higher interval is chosen, and becomes the current interval. The procedure is repeated for all bits in the code.  Finally, the latitude value is the center of the resulting interval.  Longitudes are processed in an equivalent way, keeping in mind that the initial interval is -180 to +180.

For example, in the latitude code 101111001001, the first bit is 1, so we know our latitude is somewhere between 0 and 90. Without any more bits, we'd guess the latitude was 45, giving us an error of ±45. Since more bits are available, we can continue with the next bit, and each subsequent bit halves this error. This table shows the effect of each bit. At each stage, the relevant half of the range is highlighted in green; a low bit selects the lower range, a high bit selects the upper range.

The column “mean value” shows the latitude, simply the mean value of the range. Each subsequent bit makes this value more precise.

(The numbers in the above table have been rounded to 3 decimal places for clarity)

Final rounding should be done carefully in a way that

:&lt;math&gt; \min \le \mathrm{round}(value) \le \max &lt;/math&gt;

So while rounding 42.605 to 42.61 or 42.6 is correct, rounding to 43 is not.

== Limitations when used for deciding proximity ==
=== Edge cases ===
Geohashes can be used to find points in proximity to each other based on a common prefix. However, [[edge case]] locations close to each other but on opposite sides of the 180 degree meridian will result in Geohash codes with no common prefix (different longitudes for near physical locations). Points close by at the North and South poles will have very different geohashes (different longitudes for near physical locations).

Two close locations on either side of the Equator (or Greenwich meridian) will not have a long common prefix since they belong to different 'halves' of the world. Put simply, one location's binary latitude (or longitude) will be 011111... and the other 100000...., so they will not have a common prefix and most bits will be flipped. This can also be seen as a consequence of relying on the [[Z-order curve]] (which could more appropriately be called an N-order visit in this case) for ordering the points, as two points close-by might be visited at very different times. However, two points with a long common prefix will be close-by.

In order to do a proximity search, one could compute the southwest corner (low geohash with low latitude and longitude) and northeast corner (high geohash with high latitude and longitude) of a bounding box and search for geohashes between those two. This will retrieve all points in the z-order curve between the two corners, which can be far too many points, this also breaks down at the 180 meridians and the poles. Solr uses a filter list of prefixes, by computing the prefixes of the nearest squares close to the geohash [https://web.archive.org/web/20140513235817/http://lucenerevolution.org/sites/default/files/Lucene%20Rev%20Preso%20Smiley%20Spatial%20Search.pdf].

=== Non-linearity ===
Since a geohash (in this implementation) is based on [[Geographical coordinate system|coordinates of longitude and latitude]] the distance between two geohashes reflects the distance in latitude/longitude coordinates between two points, which does not translate to actual distance, see [[Haversine formula]].

Example of non-linearity for latitude-longitude system:
* At the Equator (0 Degrees) the length of a degree of longitude is 111.320&amp;nbsp;km, while a degree of latitude measures 110.574&amp;nbsp;km, an error of 0.67%.
* At 30 Degrees (Mid Latitudes) the error is 110.852/96.486 = 14.89%
* At 60 Degrees (High Arctic) the error is 111.412/55.800 = 99.67%, reaching infinity at the poles.

Note that these limitations are not due to geohashing, and not due to latitude-longitude coordinates, but due to the difficulty of mapping coordinates on a sphere (non linear and with wrapping of values, similar to modulo arithmetic) to two dimensional coordinates and the difficulty of exploring a two dimensional space uniformly. The first is related to [[Geographical coordinate system]] and [[Map projection]], and the other to [[Hilbert curve]] and [[z-order curve]]. Once a coordinate system is found that represents points linearly in distance and wraps up at the edges, and can be explored uniformly, applying geohashing to those coordinates will not suffer from the limitations above.

While it is possible to apply geohashing to an area with a [[cartesian coordinate system]], it would then only apply to the area where the coordinate system applies.

Despite those issues, there are possible workarounds, and the algorithm has been successfully used in Elasticsearch,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/geo-shape.html geo_shape Datatype in Elasticsearch]&lt;/ref&gt; MongoDB,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Geospatial+Indexing Geospatial Indexing in MongoDB]&lt;/ref&gt; HBase, and [[Accumulo]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://geomesa.github.io/assets/outreach/SpatioTemporalIndexing_IEEEcopyright.pdf Spatio-temporal Indexing in Non-relational Distributed Databases]&lt;/ref&gt; to implement proximity searches.

== Similar systems ==
An alternative to storing Geohashes as strings in a database are [http://www.cs.umd.edu/~hjs/pubs/SametVisualComputer89.pdf Locational codes], which are also called spatial keys and similar to QuadTiles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://karussell.wordpress.com/2012/05/23/spatial-keys-memory-efficient-geohashes/ Spatial Keys]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/QuadTiles QuadTiles]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Licensing ==

The Geohash algorithm was put in the [[public domain]] by its inventor in a public announcement on February 26, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forums.groundspeak.com/GC/index.php?showtopic=186412 geohash.org announcement post in groundspeak.com forum]&lt;/ref&gt;

While comparable algorithms have been successfully patented&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/20050023524.html Compact text encoding of latitude/longitude coordinates - Patent 20050023524]&lt;/ref&gt; and

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6549">'''Georeferencing''' means that the internal coordinate system of a map or aerial photo image can be related to a ground system of geographic coordinates. The relevant coordinate transforms are typically stored within the image file ([[GeoPDF]] and [[GeoTIFF]] are examples), though there are many possible mechanisms for implementing georeferencing. The most visible effect of georeferencing is that display software can show ground coordinates (such as latitude/longitude or [[UTM coordinates]]) and also measure ground distances and areas. 
In other words, Georeferencing means to associate something with [[locations]] in [[physical space]]. The term is commonly used in the [[geographic information system]]s field to describe the process of associating a physical map or [[Raster graphics|raster image]] of a map with spatial locations. Georeferencing may be applied to any kind of object or structure that can be related to a [[location (geography)|geographical location]], such as [[Point of interest|points of interest]], roads, places, bridges, or buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Georeferencing: a review of methods and applications|author1=Hackeloeer, A. |author2=Klasing, K. |author3=Krisp, J.M. |author4=Meng, L. |journal=[[Annals of GIS]]|volume=20|issue=1|year=2014|pages=61–69|doi=10.1080/19475683.2013.868826 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geographic locations are most commonly represented using a [[Spatial reference system|coordinate reference system]], which in turn can be related to a geodetic reference system such as [[World Geodetic System|WGS-84]].

Examples include establishing the correct position of an [[aerial photograph]] within a [[map]] or finding the geographical coordinates of a [[toponymy|place name]] or street [[address (geography)|address]] ([[Geocoding]]).

==Need==
*Georeferencing is crucial to making [[Aerial imagery|aerial]] and [[satellite imagery]], usually raster images, useful for mapping as it explains how other data, such as the above [[GPS]] points, relate to the imagery.
*Very essential information may be contained in data or images that were produced at a different point of time. It may be desired either to combine or compare this data with that currently available. The latter can be used to analyze the changes in the features under study over a period of time.
*Different maps may use different projection systems. Georeferencing tools contain methods to combine and overlay these maps with minimum distortion.
*Using georeferencing methods, data obtained from surveying tools like [[total station]]s may be given a point of reference from topographic maps already available.
*It may be required to establish the relationship between social [[statistical survey|survey]] results which have been coded with [[postal codes]] or street addresses and other geographic areas such as [[census]] zones or other areas used in public administration or service planning.

==Methods==
There are various [[geographic information system|GIS]] tools available that can transform image data to some geographic control framework, like the commercial [[ArcGIS|ArcMap]], [[PCI Geomatica]], TNTmips (MicroImages,Inc) or [[ERDAS Imagine]]. One can georeference a set of points, lines, polygons, images, or 3D structures. For instance, a GPS device will record [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] coordinates for a given point of interest, effectively georeferencing this point. A georeference must be a unique identifier. In other words, there must be only one location for which a georeference acts as the reference.

Images may be encoded using special [[GIS file formats]] or be accompanied by a [[world file]].

To georeference an image, one first needs to establish control points, input the known geographic coordinates of these control points, choose the coordinate system and other projection parameters and then minimize residuals. Residuals are the difference between the actual coordinates of the control points and the coordinates predicted by the geographic model created using the control points. They provide a method of determining the level of accuracy of the georeferencing process.

In situations where data has been collected and assigned to postal or area codes, it is usually necessary to convert these to geographic coordinates by use of a definitive directory or [[gazetteer]] file.  Such gazetteers are often produced by census agencies, national mapping organizations or postal service providers.  At their simplest, these may simply comprise a list of area codes or place names and another list of corresponding codes, names or coordinate locations.  The range and purpose of the codes available is country-specific.  An example is the UK's  [http://www.ons.gov.uk/about-statistics/geography/products/geog-products-postcode/nspd/index.html National Statistics Postcode Directory] which shows each postcode's membership of census, administrative, electoral and other geographical areas.  In this case, the directory also provides dates of creation and deletion, address counts and an [[Ordnance Survey]] [[grid reference]] for each postcode, allowing it to be mapped directly.  Such gazetteer files support many [[List of online map services|web-based mapping systems]] which will place a symbol on a map or undertaken analysis such as route-finding, on the basis of postal codes, addresses or place names&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|title="Georeferencing: From Texts to Maps."|author1=Leidner, J.L.|journal=[[International Encyclopedia of Geography: People, the Earth, Environment and Technology]]|volume=vi|year=2017|pages=2897–2907|doi=10.1002/9781118786352.wbieg0160 }}&lt;/ref&gt; input by the user.

'''Hansen's problem''' is a problem in planar [[surveying]], named after the astronomer [[Peter Andreas Hansen]] (1795&amp;ndash;1874), who worked on the geodetic survey of Denmark. There are two known points ''A'' and ''B'', and two unknown points ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. From ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; an observer measures the angles made by the lines of sight to each of the other three points.  The problem is to find the positions of ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. See figure; the angles measured are&amp;nbsp;(''&amp;alpha;''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''&amp;beta;''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''&amp;alpha;''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''&amp;beta;''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

Since it involves observations of angles made at unknown points, the problem is an example of [[Resection (orientation)|resection]] (as opposed to intersection).

== Solution method overview==

Define the following angles: 
''&amp;gamma;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''AP''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''&amp;delta;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''BP''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''&amp;phi;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''AB'', ''&amp;psi;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''BA''.
As a first step we will solve for ''&amp;phi;'' and ''&amp;psi;''.
The sum of these two unknown angles is equal to the sum of ''&amp;beta;''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''&amp;beta;''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, yielding the equation

:&lt;math&gt;\phi+\psi=\beta_1+\beta_2.&lt;/math&gt;

A second equation can be found more laboriously, as follows.  The [[law of sines]] yields

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{AB}{P_2 B}=\frac{\sin \alpha_2}{\sin \phi}&lt;/math&gt; and
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{P_2 B}{P_1 P_2}=\frac{\sin \beta_1}{\sin \delta}.&lt;/math&gt;

Combining these, we get

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{AB}{P_1 P_2}=\frac{\sin \alpha_2 \sin \beta_1}{\sin \phi \sin \delta}.&lt;/math&gt;

Entirely analogous reasoning on the other side yields

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{AB}{P_1 P_2}=\frac{\sin \alpha_1 \sin \beta_2}{\sin \psi \sin \gamma}.&lt;/math&gt;

Setting these two equal gives

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\sin \phi}{\sin \psi}=\frac{\sin \gamma \sin \alpha_2 \sin \beta_1}{\sin \delta \sin \alpha_1 \sin \beta_2} = k.&lt;/math&gt;

Using a known [[trigonometric identity]] this ratio of sines can be expressed as the tangent of an angle difference:

:&lt;math&gt;\tan \frac{\phi - \psi}{2}=\frac{k-1}{k+1}\tan\frac{\phi+\psi}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

This is the second equation we need. Once we solve the two equations for the two unknowns &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, we can use either of the two expressions above for &lt;math&gt;\frac{AB}{P_1 P_2}&lt;/math&gt; to find ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; since ''AB'' is known.  We can then find all the other segments using the law of sines.&lt;ref&gt;Udo Hebisch: Ebene und Sphaerische Trigonometrie, Kapitel 1, Beispiel 4 (2005, 2006)[http://www.mathe.tu-freiberg.de/~hebisch/skripte/sphaerik/strigo.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Solution algorithm ==
We are given four angles (''&amp;alpha;''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''&amp;beta;''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''&amp;alpha;''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''&amp;beta;''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and the distance ''AB''.  The calculation proceeds as follows:

* Calculate &lt;math&gt;\gamma=\pi-\alpha_1-\beta_1-\beta_2,\quad \delta=\pi-\alpha_2-\beta_1-\beta_2.&lt;/math&gt;
* Calculate &lt;math&gt;k=\frac{\sin \gamma \sin \alpha_2 \sin \beta_1}{\sin \delta \sin \alpha_1 \sin \beta_2}.&lt;/math&gt;
* Let &lt;math&gt;s=\beta_1+\beta_2, \quad d=2 \arctan \left[ \frac{k-1}{k+1}\tan(s/2)\right]&lt;/math&gt; and then &lt;math&gt;\phi=(s+d)/2, \quad \psi=(s-d)/2.&lt;/math&gt;
* Calculate 
::&lt;math&gt;P_1 P_2 = AB \frac{\sin \phi \sin \delta}{\sin \alpha_2 \sin \beta_1}&lt;/math&gt;

: or equivalently

::&lt;math&gt;P_1 P_2 = AB \frac{\sin \psi \sin \gamma}{\sin \alpha_1 \sin \beta_2}.&lt;/math&gt;

: If one of these fractions has a denominator close to zero, use the other one.

The '''Institute of Navigation''' (ION) is a [[non-profit]] [[professional organization]] advancing the art and science of positioning, [[navigation]] and timing.  It was founded in 1945 and serves communities interested in navigation and positioning on land, air, sea and space.  It is a worldwide organization with members in more than 50 countries.  

As of 2014, the ION has approximately 2,800 members.  The ION is headquartered in [[Manassas, Virginia]].

== History ==
During World War II, the field of navigation experienced "dramatic developments [during] a period of fast-moving changes...  People recognized the need for an organization to provide a forum for discussion [of the] various aspects of navigation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ion.org/search/view_abstract.cfm?jp=j&amp;idno=76 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719065742/http://www.ion.org/search/view_abstract.cfm?jp=j&amp;idno=76 |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }} The Institute of Navigation in Perspective, ''Navigation'', Volume 18, Number 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr. Samuel Herrick, assistant professor of astronomy at [[UCLA]], proposed an institute for navigation.  Dr. Herrick envisioned a research center and publication of a journal.  

On June 25, 1945, the Institute of Navigation was founded at an organizational meeting held at UCLA.  The Institute's first permanent council was elected at the first annual meeting in October 1945.  Colin H. McIntosh, of American Airlines, was elected as the Institute's first president.  The Institute's journal, ''[[NAVIGATION]]'', was first published in March 1946. In 1961, aviator [[Dot Lemon]] became the ION's first woman president.&lt;ref&gt;''Flight'', vol. 50, 1961, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ION National Office was located on the campus of UCLA until 1960, when it moved to Washington, DC.  In 1992, the headquarters were relocated to [[Northern Virginia]].

== Conferences ==
The Institute sponsors several technical conferences each year.  These conferences focus on current developments in navigation technology and policy.  

* ION International Technical Meeting (ITM) and Precise Time and Time Interval Systems and Applications) PTTI Conference, January.
* IEEE/ION PLANS (Position, Location and Navigation Symposium) Conference, Spring, biennial.
* ION Pacific PNT (Positioning, Navigation and Timing) Conference, Spring, Biennial.
* ION Joint Navigation Conference, June, annual.
* ION GNSS+, September.  ION GNSS+ is attended by approximately 1,800 [[GPS]] and [[GNSS]] specialists from more than 40 countries.

== Programs ==
The Institute of Navigation publishes a quarterly, peer-reviewed journal, ''[[NAVIGATION]]''.  

The ION sponsors a variety of programs intended to promote the art and science of positioning, navigation and timing.  In an effort to reach out to the next generation of engineers, ION sponsors the ION Robotic Lawn Mower Competition, ION Autonomous Snowplow Competition, a scholarship program, and student paper competitions.  

The ION also sponsors government fellows that serve a one-year term in a Congressional office or an Executive Branch department.

== Awards ==
The ION recognizes individuals who have made significant contributions to the art and science of navigation.  These recognitions include annual awards and election to Fellow membership.

The '''international date line&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In this article, the convention used is to capitalize "Date Line" (or "International Date Line") when it refers to the ''standard'' [[International Date Line]], but to use small letters to refer to possible construct(s) under Jewish law.&lt;/ref&gt;  in Judaism''' is used to demarcate the change of one calendar day to the next in the [[Hebrew calendar|Jewish calendar]]. The Jewish calendar defines days as running from sundown to sundown rather than midnight to midnight. So in the context of Judaism, an international date line demarcates when the line of sundown moving across the Earth's surface stops being the sundown ending and starting one day and starts being the sundown ending and starting the following day.

However, the conventional [[International Date Line]] is a relatively recent geographic and political construct whose exact location has moved from time to time depending on the needs of different interested parties. While it is well-understood why the conventional date line is located in the Pacific Ocean, there are not really objective criteria for its exact placement within the Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;See the [[International Date Line|main article]] for details.&lt;/ref&gt; In that light, it cannot be taken for granted that the conventional International Date Line can (or should) be used as a date line under Jewish law. In practice, within Judaism the ''[[Jewish law|halakhic]]'' date line is similar to, but not necessarily identical with, the conventional Date Line, and the differences can have consequences under religious law.

==Location of the date line==

===Theoretical basis for the discussion===
Many of the opinions about the ''halakhic'' date line are structured as a response to the question of what days someone should observe as [[Shabbat]] and [[Jewish holidays]]. Shabbat occurs every seven days at any location on earth. It is normally thought to occur on Saturday—or more precisely, from Friday at sundown to Saturday at nightfall. But if the ''halakhic'' date line is not identical to the conventional Date Line, it is possible that what is Saturday with respect to the conventional Date Line is not Saturday with respect to the ''halakhic'' date line, at least in some places.

There are several opinions regarding where exactly the ''halakhic'' date line should be according to Jewish law, and at least one opinion that says that no ''halakhic'' date line really exists.&lt;ref name=kashrus/&gt;&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt;&lt;ref name="taarich"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Taplin |first1=Rabbi Yisroel |authorlink1=Yisroel Taplin |title=Sefer Taarich Yisroel |date=1998–1999 |location=Lakewood, NJ |url=http://www.datelineinhalacha.com/dateline_in_halacha.html |language=Hebrew|postscript=,}} which is summarized in English at {{cite web |title=Kitzur Taarich Yisroel: The Dateline in Halacha |url=http://www.datelineinhalacha.com/dateline_in_halacha.html |website=www.datelineinhalacha |accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=map&gt;[http://www.star-k.org/articles/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/IDL_Map.pdf The International Dateline in Halacha (Star-K)(map)], 170 kB&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|90}}'''1. ''90 degrees east of Jerusalem.''''' The concept of a ''halakhic'' date line is mentioned in the ''[[Baal HaMeor]],'' a 12th-century Talmudic commentary,&lt;ref name=kashrus&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.star-k.org/articles/kashrus-kurrents/493/a-travelers-guide-to-the-international-dateline/ |last=Heber|first=Rabbi Dovid|title=A Traveller's Guide To The International Dateline |publisher=Star-k.org |accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rabbeinu Zecharya Halevi, ''Baal Hameor'', Tractate Rosh Hashana, 20b&lt;/ref&gt; which seems to indicate that the day changes in an area where the time is six hours ahead of [[Jerusalem]] (90 degrees east of Jerusalem, about 125.2°E, a line now known to run through [[Australia]], the [[Philippines]], [[China]] and [[Russia]]). This line, which he refers to as the ''K'tzai Hamizrach'' (the easternmost line), is used to calculate the day of [[Rosh Hashanah]], the Jewish New Year. According to some sources it is alluded to in both the [[Babylonian Talmud]] ([[Rosh Hashanah (tractate)|Rosh Hashanah]] and [[Eruvin (Talmud)|Eruvin]]) and in the [[Jerusalem Talmud]].  The ''[[Kuzari]]'' of [[Yehuda Halevi]], also a 12th-century work, seems to agree with this ruling.

Later decisors like the ''[[Chazon Ish]]'' (twentieth century) fundamentally agree with this ruling. However, they recognize practical issues associated with the pure use of a line of longitude for this purpose. As an example, 125.2°E passes directly through Dongfeng Street in [[Changchun]], China.&lt;ref&gt;To be precise, at a point 1.11 km east of Xihu Rd. See [https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=43.84%2C125.2#map=12/43.8400/125.1999 location on OpenStreetMaps.]&lt;/ref&gt; If this line of longitude were used strictly, people could simply avoid Shabbat altogether by crossing the street. To prevent that, the Chazon Ish rules{{refn|Cited in Taplin&lt;ref name="taarich /&gt; at footnote 16 of the web page.}}&lt;ref name="RJJ"&gt;This is rejected by the [[Yitzchok Zev Soloveitchik|Brisker Rav]] (see {{cite journal|last1=Pahmer|first1=David|title=The International Date Line and Related Issues|journal=RJJ Journal of Halacha and Contemporary Society|date=1990|volume=XXI|pages=60–83|url=http://download2.yutorah.org/1991/1053/735807.pdf|accessdate=27 April 2016|postscript=}} at page 69), who rules that the use of this meridian is absolute.&lt;/ref&gt; that the contiguous land masses to the east of that line of longitude are considered secondary (''tafel'') to the land masses west of that line. As a result, he rules that the date line runs along 125.2°E when over water, but curves around the eastern coast of mainland Asia and Australia. By this view, Russia, China and Australia are west of the date line and observe Shabbat on local Saturday. [[Japan]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Tasmania]] are east of the date line and should observe Shabbat on local Sunday, as defined by the conventional International Date Line. By this view, the Philippines and [[Indonesia]] would have portions west of the line and portions east of the line.&lt;ref name=kashrus/&gt;&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt;

'''2. ''180 degrees east of Jerusalem.''''' Rabbi [[Yechiel Michel Tucazinsky]] ruled that the International Date Line is 180 degrees east of Jerusalem.  That would mean that the date line, rather than being near 180°, would be at 144.8°W.  By this view, places east of the conventional International Date Line but west of 144.8°W—[[Alaska]], [[Hawaii]] and a variety of archipelagos in the Pacific—would observe Shabbat on the local Friday instead of the local Saturday.

It is possible (but not certain) under this view to apply the principal of ''tafel'' described above as well. In that event, mainland Alaska would be east of the date line, but the [[Aleutian Islands]] would be west of the date line.&lt;ref name=kashrus/&gt;&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt;

'''3. ''Mid-Pacific.''''' A variety of decisors{{refn|''Inter alia,'' Rabbis David Shapira, B. Rabinowitz Thumim, the ''Atzei Sodeh,'' and the ''Alai Yonah.'' These decisors do not necessarily rule identically to each other.&lt;ref name=kashrus/&gt;&lt;ref name=chabad&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shurpin|first1=Rabbi Yehuda|title=The Sabbath, the International Date Line and Jewish Law|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1736567/jewish/|website=Chabad.org|publisher=Chabad-Lubavitch|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} rule that the date line runs in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, close to (but not necessarily the same as) the conventional International Date Line. According to this point of view, all of the major populated areas of the Pacific (such as New Zealand, Japan, Alaska and Hawaii) observe Shabbat on local Saturday (that is, consistent with the conventional International Date Line). Only certain Pacific islands, generally having few or no permanent Jewish residents, might not observe Shabbat on local Saturday.&lt;ref name=map/&gt;

'''4. ''Following local custom/There is no fixed date line.''''' According to Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Kasher]], there is no clear tradition or Talmudic source dictating any of the preceding opinions as binding. For that reason, and consistent with a [[History of responsa in Judaism|responsum]] of the [[Radbaz]], Rabbi Kasher starts with the default law that a Jew not knowing the proper day for Shabbat should count days from the last time s/he observed Shabbat, and that every seven days is Shabbat. In his view, established Jewish communities are presumed to have fixed their calendars according to this principle. Therefore, Shabbat in an established community is whatever day the community has established. Rabbi [[Isser Zalman Meltzer]] and Rabbi [[Zvi Pesach Frank]] apparently agree with this position.&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt;&lt;ref name=gewirtz&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gewirtz|first1=William L.|title=Zemannim: On the Introduction of New Constructs in Halakhah|journal=The Torah U-Madda Journal|date=2012–13|volume=16|pages=153–172|jstor=23596060}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|155}} This position does not in and of itself require a formal date line to be established, and Rabbi Kasher does not seem to think that it is necessary to do so. But the ''de facto'' result of this position is consistent with the conventional International Date Line, at least anywhere there is an established Jewish community.&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt;{{refn|Rabbi Shurpin&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt;{{rp|Note 14}} and Gewirtz&lt;ref name=gewirtz/&gt;{{rp|Note 4}} provide treatments as to how [[International Date Line#Historical alterations|changes in the location of the International Date Line]] might affect its use as a ''de facto'' standard in Jewish Law.}}

===Practical rulings===
In practice, the conventional International Date Line (or another mid-Pacific line near it) is the ''de facto'' date line under Jewish law, at least for established Jewish communities. The communities of Japan,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jccjapan.or.jp/ Jewish Community of Japan], [http://www.jcckobe.org/ Jewish Community of Kansai]&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chc.org.nz/ Canterbury Hebrew Congregation], [http://ahc.org.nz/category/events/ Auckland Hebrew Congregation]&lt;/ref&gt; Hawaii,&lt;ref&gt;[http://sofmaarav.org/ Congregation Sof Maarav], [http://www.mauijews.org/#!events/c17et Jewish Congregation of Maui]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[French Polynesia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harris|first1=Andrew|title=Shabbat in Tahiti paradise|url=http://www.jewishnews.net.au/shabbat-in-tahiti-paradise/14535|accessdate=27 April 2016|work=The Australian Jewish News|date=July 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; all observe Shabbat on local Saturday ''(i.e.,'' Friday night until Saturday night). No known Jewish community observes Shabbat on a day other than local Saturday.&lt;ref name=jta&gt;The one arguable exception is [[Samoa]], which moved from the east side of the International Date Line to the west side around New Year's Day 2012. The [[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]] located one relatively observant Jewish individual living on Samoa, who said at the time that he would follow the lead of local [[Seventh-Day Adventist]] churches and light Shabbat candles on Saturday night. (See {{cite news|last1=Soclof|first1=Adam|title=Samoa time warps into Shabbat|url=http://www.jta.org/2012/01/03/the-archive-blog/samoa-time-warps-into-shabbat|accessdate=27 April 2016|agency=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|date=3 January 2012|postscript=.)}} However, the practice of a single individual may not be sufficient to establish a community practice in Jewish law.&lt;/ref&gt; However, that practical conclusion is reached in two different ways, resulting in somewhat different practice patterns in each case.

'''''Following local custom/There is no fixed date line.''''' As noted above, according to this point of view, Shabbat is simply observed on the date previously established as Shabbat by the local community—uniformly, local Saturday&lt;ref name=jta/&gt;—without any need for any further observance. This appears to be the default practice for residents of such places as Japan, New Zealand and Hawaii. At minimum, it is difficult to find evidence of other practices by residents of those areas.&lt;ref name=worker&gt;See, as an anecdotal example, {{cite web|title=The international dateline and halacha|url=http://jewishworker.blogspot.com/2005/09/international-dateline-and-halacha.html|website=The Jewish Worker|accessdate=27 April 2016|postscript=;}} search the page for "NZ".&lt;!--This is a blog, and the pertinent comment was in the responses, not in the blog post itself. As a source, it doesn't really qualify as a RS, and it is intended to be illustrative, rather than definitive. But there is little in the way of reliable evidence, which is not surprising given that one is essentially trying to prove a negative.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Taken to a fully logical conclusion, ''no fixed date line'' means that anyone in a location without an established tradition of which day is Shabbat should always depend on his own personal count of days. It is not clear whether this can currently apply to someone traveling on his or her own to an island in the Western Pacific without an established tradition. (See, for example, Rabbi Shurpin {{refn|name=chabad}} at the end of the section "The Samoa issue".) However, it seems clear that at minimum one construes an "established community" relatively broadly. So while Japan, for example, has only a scattered handful of synagogues, their uniform practice of observing Shabbat on Saturday seems sufficient to fix Saturday as the established day for Shabbat anywhere in Japan.}}

'''''Establishment of a date line by a majority among three halakhic positions.''''' The travelers' guide of the [[Star-K]] kosher supervision service, compiled according to the rulings of its rabbinic administrator, Rabbi [[Moshe Heinemann]], uses the following approach,&lt;ref name=kashrus/&gt; which is also cited by others. According to this approach, the [[#90|first three numbered sections above]] constitute three valid, parallel, ''halakhic'' rulings. Shabbat is consequently fully observed on whichever day is consistent with the majority view among those opinions (two out of three). However, out of respect to the minority view of the third ruling, and with an eye toward not desecrating Shabbat, [[Melacha|Torah-level prohibitions]] are to be avoided on the day consistent with the minority view, although that day is otherwise considered a weekday. According to this rule, practice is as follows: 
* In New Zealand and Japan, the local Saturday is Shabbat according to the majority opinion (sections 2 and 3 above), and it should therefore be fully observed as Shabbat. However, since according to the minority opinion (section 1 above), Shabbat is on the local Sunday, one should not perform any Torah-level Shabbat prohibitions on Sunday. Nevertheless, on Sunday, one should pray the regular weekday prayers, donning [[tefillin]] during morning prayers.
* In Hawaii and French Polynesia, the local Saturday is Shabbat according to majority opinion (sections 1 and 3 above), and it should therefore be fully observed as Shabbat. However, since according to the minority opinion (section 2 above), Shabbat is on the local Friday, one should not perform any Torah-level Shabbat prohibitions on Friday. Friday prayers are weekday prayers, and preparation for Shabbat must be done with an eye to avoiding Torah-level Shabbat prohibitions.&lt;ref name=kashrus/&gt; 
* In principle, a zone of pure doubt exists in approximately the area of 169°W–177°E,&lt;ref name=map/&gt; including places like [[Tonga]], Samoa and [[American Samoa]]. The rulings of the ''Mid-Pacific'' group above are not perfectly consistent in this area,&lt;ref name=kashrus/&gt; so there is no possibility of an unambiguous "two out of three" consensus here. Rabbi Dovid Heber of the Star-K suggests that in such locations one might need to observe Shabbat fully for two days every week.&lt;ref name="heber2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Heber|first1=Rabbi Dovid|title=How to Keep This Shabbos in Samoa? STAR-K Tells Us How (Samoa &amp; Tokelau To Cross International Date Line)|url=http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/headlines-breaking-stories/113307/how-to-keep-this-shabbos-in-samoa-star-k-tells-us-how-samoa-tokelau-to-cross-international-date-line.html|website=The Yeshiva World News|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Star-K's international kosher supervision staff follows this approach, and there is evidence that some other travelers also do.&lt;ref name=worker/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Dateline|url=http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.culture.religion.jewish.avodah/26561|website=avodah@aishdas.com|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authorities suggesting this approach often advise travelers to avoid the zone of doubt entirely near weekends, or to consult with a competent rabbinical authority directly.&lt;ref name=heber2/&gt;

==Crossing the halakhic date line==
The issues discussed in the previous section apply ''per se'' to individuals or communities in fixed locations. However, the act of crossing the date line (wherever it may be drawn) introduces a number of additional issues under Jewish law. Questions potentially affected include:&lt;ref name=kashrus/&gt;
{{div col}}
*Crossing the line into or out of Shabbat or a holiday, or a [[Ta'anit|rabbinic fast day]], while already aboard an airplane or a ship
*Determining what prayers to say (and when) while in transit
*Lighting candles on [[Hanukkah]]
*[[Counting of the Omer]], and consequently fixing the day for [[Shavuot]]
*[[Niddah|Counting days until relations are permitted following menstruation]]
*Fixing the date for [[Brit Milah]], [[Pidyon Haben]] or [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah]]
{{div col end}}
In some cases, crossing the date line (wherever it may be drawn) has a specific impact on practice or prohibitions under Jewish law. In others, an individual's count of days (by the experience of sunset and sunrise) is the determining factor, regardless of the crossing of the date line. Details around specific questions, cases and rulings of Jewish law are beyond the scope of this article.{{refn|See Taplin&lt;ref name="taarich" /&gt;, which covers these questions in some detail. The author notes that there are consensus opinions about some—but not all—of these issues.}}

==Considerations for astronauts==
Before Israeli astronaut [[Ilan Ramon]] flew on the [[Space Shuttle Columbia|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'']] in 2003, he decided (after consultation with rabbis) to observe Shabbat according to time in his last residence, [[Kennedy Space Center|Cape Canaveral]], since he would be crossing the date line and observing sunset many times per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Ask the rabbi: Shabbat in space|date=18 January 2003|website=ohr.edu|publisher=[[Ohr Somayach, Jerusalem]]|url=https://ohr.edu/explore_judaism/ask_the_rabbi/ask_the_rabbi/637|accessdate=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|work=[[Jewish Virtual Library]]|title=Ilan Ramon|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/ilan-ramon|date=February 2, 2003|accessdate=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=standard /&gt; [[Judith Resnik]], the first American Jewish astronaut in space, lit (electronic) Shabbat candles according to the time in [[Johnson Space Center|Houston, TX]], her home and the location of [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center|Mission Control]].&lt;ref name=standard&gt;{{cite web|title=Jewish Astronauts|author=Warren Boroson|date=26 January 2015|website=Jewish Standard|url=http://jewishstandard.timesofisrael.com/jewish-asttronauts/|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''La Cartografía Mallorquina''''' ('' The Majorcan cartography '') is a book of essays on the [[Majorca]]n [[portolan]]s  written by Professor [[Julio Rey Pastor]] with the collaboration of Ernesto García Camarero. It is a scholarly essay, a key element in the study of portolans, especially those made by Majorcans as half of the book is devoted to the study of more than 400 Majorcan portolans existing worldwide.

==Style of the Majorcan School==

Rey Pastor before explaining how to identify the works of this school for its unmistakable traits, he says:
''".. In the monumental Periplus of the unsurpassed  [[Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld]],&lt;ref name="Bataller2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ramon J. Puchades i Bataller|title=Les cartes portolanes: la representació medieval d'una mar solcada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S6F-NwAACAAJ|year=2007|publisher=Institut Cartogràfic de Catalunya|isbn=978-84-9785-414-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; I saw with pleasant surprise that the most varicoloured parchments, ornamented with fabulous effigies of monarchs and naive legends, '' written in Catalan '' with lots of information, physical, biological and political, of each region, they originate in Majorca -in an unknown date-, being designated as  "catalan maps"...'''

Dr. Julio in his book, gives an explanation of why no Spanish scholar had touched the subject, referring to the unjust appropriation of some portolans by some Italian scholars: "Our geographers, insufficiently armed, they stayed timidly neutral; and the militant vindicator of Spanish science, Dr. Gumersindo Laverde -who had organized a phalanx defending the flag hoisted by the young scholar [[Menéndez y Pelayo]]-, they remained silent, for the great scholar had forgotten this chapter of the medieval science "..

Rey Pastor -a great mathematician and lover of the cartography- entered into this profile, in fact cartographers were apart from being artists they had to master mathematics -at least some of them- as the projection of the sphere on a plane it needs them.

Julio Rey Pastor, was able to make the point defending the catalan authorship of many Majorcan portolans against both, the Portuguese scholars, and some Italian "scholars", and in fact he could not be more impartial, for he was not catalan, he was from [[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]].

* From the signature “Petrus Rosselli me fecit ab Majoricarum Insulae”. (.."de arte beccaria".. they misinterpreted it as a student of Beccaria)
* From Angelino Dulcert's signature some Italians claimed that Dulcert was "Dalorto" misspelled..

== Influence on Portuguese map makers==

Rey Pastor says.. "..That [[Jehuda Cresques]] (c. 1415) acted as  founder and director of the [[Escola de Sagres]], was known to historians for over a century, with doubts on which "mestre Jacome" from Majorca corresponded to the "mestre Jacome" contracted by Prince Henry, (although he was the only cartographer with that name).. But it's unforgivable that some scholars arrived to the point (based in a high cartographic ignorance), to attribute the invention of portolans to the school of the Infant, if not to him personally .. but how could that make sense, being the school founded by the emigrated Cresques (about 1400), when at his seventies he was tired of manufacturing planispheres, during half a century, for the insatiable [[Peter IV of Aragon|Peter the Ceremonious]] and for his son, the also map-maniac DON JOAN.. On top of that one should not forget to include the testimony of [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira|Pacheco Pereira]]...:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Estudos de História, Volume III|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=dVc0MZsZj48C&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=pacheco+pereira+mandou+%C3%A1+ilha+de+Malhorca+por+um+mestre+Jacome,+mestre+de+cartas+de+marear,&amp;hl=ca&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwBGoVChMIhvKT7vHdyAIVh4ssCh3WGwdL#v=onepage&amp;q=pacheco%20pereira%20mandou%20%C3%A1%20ilha%20de%20Malhorca%20por%20um%20mestre%20Jacome%2C%20mestre%20de%20cartas%20de%20marear%2C&amp;f=false|publisher=UC Biblioteca Geral 1|pages=10–|id=GGKEY:7186FCQBHS5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mining claim, South Yuba River (cropped).jpg|thumb|Claim at the [[Yuba River|South Yuba River]]]]
A '''land claim''' is a legal declaration of desired control over areas of property, including bodies of water. The phrase is usually only used with respect to disputed or unresolved land claims. Some types of land claims include [[aboriginal land claim]]s, [[Territorial claims of Antarctica|Antarctic land claims]], and post-colonial land claims.

Land claims is sometimes used as a term when referring to disputed territories like [[Western Sahara]] or to refer to the claims of displaced persons. 

In the [[Colonialism|colonial]] times of the United States American men could claim a piece of land for themselves and the claim has different level of merit according to the [[de facto]] conditions:
# claim without any action on the ground
# claim with (movable) property of the claimant on the ground
# claim with the claimant visiting the land
# claim with claimant living on the land.

Today, only small areas of unclaimed land remain, yet large plots of land with little economical value (e.g., in Alaska) can still be bought for very low prices. Also, in certain parts of the world, land can still be [[Land_tenure#Modes_of_ownership_and_tenure|obtained]] by making productive use of it.

==Mining claim (United States)==
A '''mining claim''' is the claim of the right to extract minerals from a tract of public land. In the United States, the practice began with the [[California gold rush]] of 1849. In the absence of effective government, the miners in each new mining camp made up their own rules, and chose to essentially adopt Mexican mining law then in effect in California. The Mexican law gave the right to mine to the first one to discover the mineral deposit and begin mining it. The area that could be claimed by one person was limited to that which could be mined by a single individual or a small group.

The US system of mining claims is an application of the legal theory of ''[[prior appropriation]]'', by which public property is granted to the first one to put it to beneficial use.  Other applications of appropriation theory were the [[Homestead Act]], which granted public land to farmers, and water rights in the west.

The California miners spread the concept of mining claims to other mining districts all over the western United States.  The US Congress legalized the practice in 1866, and amended it in the [[Mining Act of 1872]].  All land in the [[Public_domain_(land)|public domain]], that is, federal land whose use has not been restricted by the government to some specific purpose, was subject to being claimed.  The mining law has been changed numerous times, but still retains some features similar to those settled on by the California [[California_Gold_Rush#Forty-niners|49ers]].

The concept was also used in other countries, for example during the [[Australian gold rushes]] which occurred at a similar time starting from the 1850s, and included similar groups of people including miners that migrated from the American gold rushes. The [[Oriental Claims]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] are one example of this.

===Staking a claim===
[[File:Mining claim corner Blue Ribbon Mine Alaska.jpg|thumb|Corner post of the claim of the Blue Ribbon Mine in Alaska]]

'''Staking a claim''' involves first the discovery of a valuable mineral in quantities that a "prudent man" (the Prudent Man Rule) would invest time and expenses to recover. Next, marking the claim boundaries, typically with wooden posts or capped steel posts, which must be four feet tall, or stone cairns, which must be three feet tall. Finally, filing a claim with both the land management agency (USFS or BLM), and the local county registrar.

There are four main types of mining claims: 
# Placer (minerals free of the local bedrock, and deposited in benches or streams) 
# Lode (minerals in place in the mother rock), 
# Tunnel (a location for a proposed tunnel which claims all veins discovered during the driving of it) 
# Millsite (a maximum five acre site for processing ore) 

A mining claim always starts out as an '''unpatented claim'''. The owner of an unpatented claim must continue mining or exploration activities on an unpatented claim, or he may pay a fee to the land management agency by September 1 of each year, or it is considered abandoned and becomes null. Activities on unpatented claims must be restricted to those necessary to mining. A '''patented claim''' is one for which the federal government has issued a ''patent'' (deed). To obtain a patent, the owner of a mining claim must prove to the federal government that the claim contains locatable minerals that can be extracted at a profit. A patented claim can be used for any purpose desired by the owner, just like any other real estate. However, Congress has ceased funding for the patenting process, so at this time a claim cannot be patented.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

A '''hydrographic office''' is an organization which is devoted to acquiring and publishing [[hydrography|hydrographic]] information.

The [[International Hydrographic Organization]] comprises (as of June 2018) 89 Member States, three of these are suspended because of their lapsed annual financial contributions The IHO identifies its representative member organisations as the respective national hydrographic offices, although the member organisations of some countries are part of wider maritime or other administrations covering a larger range of tasks (for example, oceanography, transport, maritime regulation).
In some nations (for example, the UK and France) the hydrographic offices are sub-organisations of the country's Ministry of Defence or the navy, in others they are civilian organisations.

Historically, the main tasks of national hydrographic offices were the acquisition of hydrographic information, including through undertaking [[hydrographic survey]]s, and the subsequent publication of [[nautical chart]]s.

Besides nautical charts, many hydrographic offices publish a body of books and periodicals that are collectively known as [[nautical publications]]. The most important of these are:
*[[Sailing Directions]] (or ''pilots''): detailed descriptions of areas of the sea, shipping routes, [[harbour]]s, aids to navigation, regulations etc.
*[[List of Lights|lists of lights]]: descriptions of lighthouses and lightbouys
*[[tide]] tables and tidal stream atlases
*[[ephemeris|ephemerides]] and [[nautical almanac]]s for [[celestial navigation]]
*[[Notice to Mariners]]: periodical (often weekly) updates and corrections for nautical charts and publications

Hydrographic organizations may also be involved in services such as:
*[[pilotage]]
*[[search and rescue]]
*maintenance of [[lighthouse]]s and other aids to navigation
*[[ice breaking]]
*weather observation and information
*sea traffic information and surveillance
*maritime research
*regulatory affairs of ship safety

==History==
In the development of hydrographic services, shipping organizations played a part, but the major players were the naval powers. Recognizing hydrographic information was a military advantage these naval organizations, usually under the direction of a "Hydrographer" utilized the expertise of naval officers in collecting hydrographic data that was incorporated into the navy's collection. In order to distribute the processed information (charts, directions, notices, and such) these organizations often developed specialized printing capabilities.

==Hydrographic organisations of some countries==

===Argentina===
The [[Argentine Naval Hydrographic Service]] was established in 1879.

===Australia===
{{Main|Australian Hydrographic Service}} {{See also|Australian Pilot}}
Hydrographic tasks in [[Australia]]n waters were performed by the United Kingdom's [[Royal Navy]] since the 19th century. In 1920 the [[Australian Hydrographic Service]] was formed as a part of the [[Royal Australian Navy]].

===Brazil===
Hydrographic tasks in Brazilian waters were performed by the [https://www.marinha.mil.br/dhn/] since 02/02/1876.

===Canada===
Starting in 1883, the "Georgian Bay Survey" was responsible for hydrographic surveying of [[Georgian Bay]] and [[Lake Huron]].  Its geographic area of responsibility increased and in 1904 the name was changed to the "Hydrographic Survey of Canada."  The current name [[Canadian Hydrographic Service]] (CHS) was adopted in 1928.

In 1951, Canada became a State Member of the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) and the Hydrographer-General of Canada (formerly known as the Dominion Hydrographer) is Canada's representative.

Today, the mandate of CHS is found in the Canada Oceans Act, the Canada Shipping Act (Charts and Publications Regulations) and the Navigable Waters Protection Act.

With its headquarters office located in Ottawa, Ontario there are regional offices in Sidney (British Columbia), Burlington (Ontario), Mont-Joli (Quebec), Halifax (Nova Scotia), and a branch office in St. John’s Newfoundland.  CHS has 300 staff across the country.

The national chart folio consists of 950 paper charts, 541 S-57 vector Electronic Navigation Charts and 651 raster charts in the BSB format.  CHS produces and maintains seven volumes of Tides and Water Levels books, 25 Sailing Directions books, and prints and distributes a number of publications such as the Annual Notices to Mariners and Radio Aids to Marine Navigation.

In addition to significant hydrographic data holdings (single &amp; multibeam), CHS operates 78 permanent water level stations, a real time water level and forecast system in the St. Lawrence River, and participates in the operation of Atlantic &amp; Pacific tsunami warning systems.

CHS is directly responsible for the sales and distribution of all its products, in paper and digital form.  A network of 850 dealers (domestic and international) distributes CHS paper and digital products.  Products and data are also made available to Value Added Resellers, under licence.

===Chile===
Since 1874, the Navy's Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service ("SHOA", as acronym of [http://www.shoa.cl "Servicio Hidrográfico y Oceanográfico de la Armada"]) has been the [[Chile]]an official authority on drawing and publishing nautical charts of the South Pacific Ocean for Military and Civil navigation.
This institution is also the main authority on controlling the [[hour|official hour]] of the country.

===Denmark===
In [[Denmark]] (including [[Greenland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]]), hydrographic surveying and charting is conducted by "Kort &amp; Matrikelstyrelsen" (KMS), a division of the Ministry of Environment.

===France===
{{Main|Naval Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service}}
In [[France]], the first official organization, the French Dépôt des Cartes, Plans, Journaux et Mémoires Relatifs à la Navigation, was formed in 1720.

Today, the [[SHOM]] is the official French hydrographic office, it stands for 'Service Hydrographique et Océanographique de la Marine' and means [[Naval Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service]].

===Germany===
The "[[Bundesamt für Seeschiffahrt und Hydrographie]]" (BSH) is the [[Germany|German]] federal hydrographic office. Its offices are located in [[Hamburg]] and [[Rostock]]. The BSH is responsible for a wide variety of services, among them hydrographic surveys, nautical publications, ship registration, testing and approval of technical equipment, [[oceanography|oceanographic]] research, development of nautical information systems, and maritime pollution surveillance. The BSH runs six ships for survey and research purposes.

In 1945 the tasks of various predecessor organisations (among them the German Navy's hydrographic service, the [[Wilhelmshaven]] maritime observatory, and the "Deutsche Seewarte" under [[Georg von Neumayer]]) were concentrated in the newly created "Deutsches Hydrographisches Institut" (DHI) in Hamburg. In 1990 the DHI and the corresponding [[East Germany|East German]] organisation, the "Seehydrographische Dienst der DDR" in Rostock were integrated to form the BSH in its present form.

===Greece===

The [https://web.archive.org/web/20110709095234/http://www.hnhs.gr/portal/page/portal/HNHS Hellenic Navy Hydrographic Service] (HNHS, {{lang-el|Υδρογραφική Υπηρεσία Πολεμικού Ναυτικού}}), an independent service of the [[Hellenic Navy]] General Staff, is responsible for hydrographic surveying and production and sale of charts. The first naval hydrographic office was created in 1905 and its first mission was the hydrographic survey of Maliakos Gulf. Its first nautical chart was issued in 1909 and in 1919 the Hellenic Navy became a founding member of the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO). The hydrographic office evolved into the independent naval Hydrographic Service in 1921. Today the HNHS operates three naval hydrographic vessels: ''HS OS Nautilos'' (A-478), ''HS OS Pytheas'' (A-474) and ''HS Stravon'' (A-476).

===Hong Kong ===
The [http://www.hydro.gov.hk Hong Kong Hydrographic Office] is responsible for hydrographic surveying and production of nautical charts covering the waters of Hong Kong.  It also produced electronic navigational charts and made available the prediction of tidal stream digitally *[https://web.archive.org/web/20050920101756/http://www.hydro.gov.hk/tidal/district.htm] on the internet.

===India===
{{main|National Hydrographic Office}}
The Indian Naval Hydro-graphic Department (INHD) headed by Chief Hydrographer to the Government of India is an Indian Government agency responsible for hydro-graphic surveys and nautical charting in India. It operates a fleet of eight oceangoing conventional hull survey vessels and one large catamaran hull vessel [[INS Makar (J31)]] of the [[Alcock Ashdown survey catamaran|Alcock Ashdown Class]], with five more of the class due to be commissioned soon.

The Indian Marine Survey Department was established at [[Calcutta]] in 1874, which became a part of the [[Royal Indian Navy|Royal Indian Marine]] in 1882. The Hydrographic Department of the Indian Navy derives its origin from the charting activities of the [[British East India Company]], way back in the 17th century. John and Samuel Thornton, Hydrographers to the East India Company compiled the first chart and Sailing Directions for the Indian Ocean in 1703. During the next two centuries, the captains of the ships of the East India Company went on to pioneer the charting of the Eastern seas extending from Red Sea to Persian Gulf, Arabian Sea, across the Indian Ocean right up to the China Seas.

After India{{'}}s independence from the [[United Kingdom]], the Marine Survey Office was shifted to [[Dehradun]] on 1 June 1954 and was renamed as the Naval Hydrographic Office. The Naval Hydrographic Office was renamed in 1997 as the National Hydrographic Office in recognition of its national stature and increasing international role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hydrobharat.nic.in/brief_history.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222024712/http://www.hydrobharat.nic.in/brief_history.htm |archivedate=22 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://indiannavy.nic.in/book/naval-hydrographic-department&lt;/ref&gt;

Total mapping coverage of the INSS to end of 2005 was 432,000&amp;nbsp;km² and taken along with an earlier DCENR Petroleum Affairs Division, over 81% of the Irish designated seabed area (at end 2005) has been mapped. The INtegrated Mapping FOr the Sustainable Development of Ireland’s MArine Resource (INFOMAR) programme is a successor to the Irish National Seabed Survey (INSS) and concentrates on creating a range of integrated mapping products of the physical, chemical and biological features of the seabed in the near-shore area. The programme is being funded by the Irish Government through the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources as part of the National Development Plan, 2007 – 2013 [11]. Data are passed on to the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office (UKHO) for subsequent production of nautical charts.

===Russia===
{{main|Russian Hydrographic Service}}
The Russian Hydrographic Office was founded in 1777 by the [[Admiralty Board (Russian Empire)|Admiralty Board]] of the [[Russian Empire]]. The hydrographic service in [[Russia]] has been historically attached to the [[Russian Navy]] and the agents and supervisors of hydrographic works have been largely naval officers since it was established. Having operated under different names along its history, the Russian Hydrographic Service is one of the first hydrographic offices in the world.&lt;ref&gt;С этой чертежной началось централизованное производство морских карт в России, а дата утверждения штата чертежной — 2 (13) ноября 1777 г. — является датой основания ныне существующего Центрального картографического производства Военно-Морского Флота.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
"Sjöfartsverket", Swedish Maritime Administration, includes the [[Sweden|Swedish]] national hydrographic organisation. Established in 1956 and governed by the Ministry of Industry, Employment and Communications, Sjöfartsverket is responsible for most aspects of safe navigation in Sweden. This includes maintenance and marking of fairways, surveying and charting Swedish waters, pilotage, search-and-rescue (in cooperation with other organisations), ice-breaking, and safety inspections.

===United Kingdom===
{{Main|United Kingdom Hydrographic Office}}
The [[United Kingdom]] has a long hydrographic history officially begun with the 1683 appointment of Captain [[Greenville Collins|Grenville Collins]] as Hydrographer to the King.&lt;ref Name=rnhis&gt;http://www.naval-history.net/xGM-Tech-HydrographicSurvey.htm | HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEY WORK IN THE ROYAL NAVY UP TO THE 1980s by Geoffrey B Mason, Lieutenant Commander, RN (Rtd)&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[Royal Navy]] dominating the seas  hydrography grew to a worldwide hydrographic activity. Royal Navy charts and the related surveys were reputedly officially started as a result of the loss of [[Admiral]] [[Cloudesley Shovell|Sir Cloudesley Shovell]] on an uncharted [[reef]] off the [[Isles of Scilly|Scilly Isles]] which happened in October 1707 (see main article [[Scilly naval disaster of 1707]]). The office of [[Hydrographer of the Navy]] was created in 1795. 
The British tradition of hydrographic surveys extended to the nations with a common legacy in the Empire, for example, the [[Australian Hydrographic Service]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hydro.gov.au/aboutus/past.htm{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} | Australian Hydrographic Service - The Past&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Admiralty Hydrographic Office]] ceased to be a naval department and became the [[United Kingdom Hydrographic Office]] (located in [[Taunton, Somerset]], near Creechbarrow hill) which continues the legacy within the Ministry of Defence&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ukho.gov.uk/AboutUs/Pages/Corporate.aspx | UKHO - About Us&lt;/ref&gt; with responsibility for the Admiralty Charts&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ukho.gov.uk/PRODUCTSANDSERVICES/Pages/ChartAvailabilityList.aspx | UKHO - Admiralty Chart Availability List&lt;/ref&gt; covering almost every navigable stretch of water on Earth. The UKHO also calculates tide tables for the UK. The Royal Navy maintains a number of hydrographic survey vessels &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/operations-and-support/surface-fleet/hydrographic-vessels/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101025194533/http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/operations-and-support/surface-fleet/hydrographic-vessels/ |archivedate=25 October 2010 |df= }} | Royal Navy - Hydrographic Vessels&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the US government, all of whose creative work is placed into the public domain, British government policy requires agencies such as the UKHO and the [[Ordnance Survey]] to be self-funding through the sale of the information they create. The Hydrographic Office therefore actively protects the copyright of all of its data including paper charts, electronic charts, tidal data and other data and has been known to take measures to ensure that its copyrighted information is used appropriately.

In 2013 the UKHO added an important new service for users of its paper charts by allowing its authorized agents to [[Print on Demand]] most paper charts.

UKHO attracted worldwide attention in February 2005 when it published in-depth pictures of the [[ocean floor]] in the vicinity of the Indian Ocean [[tsunami]] disaster of 26 December 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukho.gov.uk/content/corpAttachments/press_releases/Tsunami.pdf |format=PDF |title=Press release, 9th January 2005 |publisher=UKHO |work=www.ukho.gov.uk |accessdate=2006-11-15 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928061318/http://www.ukho.gov.uk/content/corpAttachments/press_releases/Tsunami.pdf |archivedate=28 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Atlantic Ocean]] --&gt;
In the [[United States]], the Survey of the Coast (America's first scientific agency) was established through an 1807 Congressional resolution and signed into law by [[Thomas Jefferson|President Jefferson]].  It subsequently became the [[U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey]] in 1878, and incorporated the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Corps|Coast and Geodetic Survey Corp]] in 1917.  (Surveyors who were commissioned officers could not be shot as spies if captured during time of war.)  The [[U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey]] was eventually incorporated into the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) when it was formed in 1970. NOAA's [[Office of Coast Survey]] is the national Hydrographic Office of the [[United States]].

Non-domestic hydrographic and bathymetric surveys are conducted by the U.S. [[Naval Oceanographic Office]], which started with the establishment of the Depot of Charts and Instruments in 1830 that by 1854 was designated the U.S. Naval Observatory and Hydrographical Office. The hydrographic portion became the [[U.S. Naval Hydrographic Office]] under the Hydrographer of the Navy, appointed from uniformed personnel from 1870 through 1961. With the popularization of oceanography in the early 1960s (partly due to President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s interest), the name was changed to the U.S. [[Naval Oceanographic Office]] in 1962. That office, as a matter of historical and semantic interest, and the U.S. Naval Observatory are still part of the command overseen by the "Oceanographer of the Navy," with headquarters at the Naval Observatory. In 2001, the position of "Hydographer of the Navy" was re-established.&lt;ref name="hydro"&gt;[http://www.hydro-international.com/issues/articles/id238-US_Navy_Hydrography_Is_Back.html "US Navy Hydrography Is Back!"], ''Hydro International'', May 2002, Volume 6, Number 4, accessed 31 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

====History====

{{main|National Geodetic Survey}}

In 1807, the United States created the [[United States Survey of the Coast]], the first [[United States Government]] scientific agency, giving it the responsibility for hydrographic surveys of the waters of the United States. Its surveying activities did not begin until 1816 and then were suspended completely when the [[United States Army]] and [[United States Navy]] were given the responsibility for surveys in 1818. Surveying responsibility returned to the Survey of the Coast in 1832, and it conducted the first official hydrographic survey in U.S. history in 1834. It was renamed the [[United States Coast Survey]] in 1836.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lib.noaa.gov/noaainfo/heritage/coastsurveyvol1/CONTENTS.html# |title=NOAA History: The Coast Survey 1807-1867 |access-date=2 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628110735/http://www.lib.noaa.gov/noaainfo/heritage/coastsurveyvol1/CONTENTS.html# |archive-date=28 June 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, the Coast Survey accumulated a small fleet of ships to employ in surveying work. In 1871, the Coast Survey was given the responsibility of conducting [[Geodesy|geodetic]] surveys in the interior of the United States, and in 1878 it was renamed the [[United States Coast and Geodetic Survey]]. In 1959, the Coast and Geodetic Survey was given the responsibility for U.S. Government hydrographic surveying activities worldwide.&lt;ref name="noaahistoryuscgs"&gt;[http://www.history.noaa.gov/legacy/corps.html NOAA History: NOAA Corps and the Coast and Geodetic Survey]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, the Coast and Geodetic Survey was subordinated to the new [[Environmental Science Services Administration]] (ESSA), although it retained its separate identity. On 3 October 1970, ESSA was expanded and reorganized to become the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA), and at that time a number of U.S. Government scientific agencies, including the Coast and Geodetic Survey, merged and were reorganized to form NOAA. Among other things, NOAA took over the Coast and Geodetic Survey{{'}}s responsibility for hydrographic surveys, and the Coast and Geodetic Survey{{'}}s fleet merged with those of other U.S. government agencies to form the NOAA fleet, which includes [[survey ship]]s that carry out hydrographic surveys.&lt;ref name="noaahistoryuscgs"/&gt;
In the United States, statutory authority for hydrographic surveys of [[territorial waters]] and the [[exclusive economic zone]] (EEZ) lies with the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA).&lt;ref Name=nhsptxt&gt;http://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/hsd/docs/NHSP_2009_TextOnly.pdf | NOAA Hydrographic Survey Priorities 2009 Edition&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/hsd/NHSP.htm | NOAA Hydrographic Survey Priorities&lt;/ref&gt; NOAA hydrographic surveys are administered by the [[National Ocean Service]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/hsd/hydrog.htm | NOS - Hydrographic Surveying&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/about/nos_org_chart.pdf | National Ocean Service Organization Chart&lt;/ref&gt; and carried out by the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Corps]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.careers.noaa.gov/career_fields.html | WELCOME TO NOAA CAREERS&lt;/ref&gt; and federal government civilians.

The NOAA Office of Coast Survey{{'}}s Hydrographic Surveys Division estimates it has awarded approximately $250 million in contracts for hydrographic surveying and related support since 1994.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/hsd/contrac.htm | Office of Coast Survey, Contract Hydrographic Surveys&lt;/ref&gt;

====Today====

==Global circumnavigations==

===Seacraft===
&lt;!-- NOTE: Not all of these may be "ships"--&gt;

====16th century====
* The 18 survivors, led by [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]], of [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s [[Magellan–Elcano circumnavigation|Castilian ('Spanish') expedition]] (which began with 5 ships and 270 men); 1519–1522; westward from Spain; in ''[[Victoria (ship)|Victoria]]''. After Magellan was killed by people of the [[Philippines]] Lapu-Lapu on 27 April 1521, the circumnavigation was completed under the command of the Basque Spanish seafarer [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]] who returned to [[Sanlúcar de Barrameda]], Spain, on 6 September 1522, after a journey of 3 years and 1 month.&lt;ref&gt;Kurlansky, Mark. 1999. ''The Basque History of the World''. Walker &amp; Company, New York. {{ISBN|0-8027-1349-1}}, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; These men were the '''first to circumnavigate the globe in a single expedition'''.
* The survivors of [[García Jofre de Loaísa]]'s Spanish expedition 1525–1536 including [[Andrés de Urdaneta]]; westward from Spain. None of Loaísa's seven ships completed the voyage, but ''Santa María de la Victoria'' reached the [[Moluccas]] before being wrecked in a Portuguese attack. Successive chiefs of the expedition (Loaísa, Elcano, Salazar, Iñiguez, De la Torre) died during the voyages. [[Andrés de Urdaneta]] and other fellow men survived, reaching the [[Spice Islands]] in 1526, to be taken prisoner by the Portuguese. Urdaneta and a few of his men returned to Spain in 1536 aboard Portuguese ships via [[Portuguese India|India]], the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and Portugal, and completed the second world circumnavigation in history.
* [[Francis Drake]]; 1577–1580; westward from England; in ''[[Golden Hind]]''; discovered the [[Drake Passage]] but entered the Pacific via the [[Strait of Magellan]]; '''first English circumnavigation''' and the second carried out in a single expedition. Drake was the first to complete a circumnavigation as captain while leading the expedition throughout the entire circumnavigation.
* [[Martín Ignacio de Loyola]]; 1580–1584; westward from Spain.
* [[Thomas Cavendish]]; 1586–1588; westward from England; in ''[[Desire (ship)|Desire]]''.
* [[Martín Ignacio de Loyola]]; 1585–1589; eastward from Spain (via Macau, China, and Acapulco, Mexico); '''First person to circumnavigate the world twice''', first one to circumnavigate '''eastwards''' and both westwards and eastwards (1580–1584 westward and 1585–1589 eastward), and first to use overland routes in his circumnavigation.
* [[João da Gama]]; 1584 (or 1585)–1590; eastward from Portugal; from Lisbon to India, Malacca, Macau (China) and Japan. Gama crossed the Pacific at a higher northern latitude; was taken prisoner in Mexico and carried in Spanish ships to the Iberian Peninsula. One of the first to do eastwards, mostly by sea.

====17th century====
* The survivors of the expedition of [[Jacques Mahu]]; 1598–1601; westward from Holland; Of Mahu's five ships only two returned.
* The survivors of the expedition of [[Olivier van Noort]]; 1598–1601; westward from Holland; Of Van Noort's four ships only two returned.
* [[Francesco Carletti]]; Florentine merchant; 1594–1602; westward from Italy; travelled across the American continent overland, through Panama. All Carletti's other travel was by sea until he ended in the Netherlands; he travelled from there overland back to Italy. Carletti was perhaps the first to travel all legs as a passenger, not as a ship's officer or a crew member. Carletti described his journey in his autobiography, "My Voyage Around the World", translated into various languages.
* [[Joris van Spilbergen]]; 1614–1617; westward from Holland.
* [[Willem Schouten]] and [[Jacob Le Maire]]; 1615–1617; westward from Holland; in ''Eendraght''; Discovered [[Cape Horn]] and the '''first expedition to enter the Pacific via the [[Drake Passage]]'''.
* [[Jacques l'Hermite]] and [[John Hugo Schapenham]]; 1623–1626; westward from Holland.
* [[Pedro Cubero]]; 1670–1679; eastward from Spain; the '''first maritime circumnavigation including significant travel overland'''.
* [[William Dampier]] (English); 1679–1691; westward from England.
* [[Gemelli Careri|Giovanni Francesco Gemelli Careri]]; 1693–1698; eastward from Naples; the '''first [[tourist]] to circumnavigate the globe, paying his own way on multiple voyages''', crossing Mexico on land.

====18th century====
* [[William Funnell (sailor)|William Funnell]] (English); 1703–1706.&lt;ref name="Robert Kerr Gutenberg"&gt;{{Gutenberg|no=13130 |name=A General History and Collection of Voyages and Travels }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[William Dampier]] (English); 1703–1706.&lt;ref name="Robert Kerr Gutenberg" /&gt;
* [[Woodes Rogers]] (English); 1708–1711; with the ''Duke'' and the ''Duchess''; He rescued [[Alexander Selkirk]] on Juan Fernandez on 31 January 1709. Selkirk had been stranded there for four years.
* [[William Dampier]] (English); 1708–1711; '''First person to circumnavigate the world three times''' (1679–1691, 1703–1707 and 1708–1711).
* [[George Anson, 1st Baron Anson]]; 1740–1744; in {{HMS|Centurion|1732|6}}.
* [[John Byron]]; 1764–1766; in {{HMS|Dolphin|1751|6}}. &lt;!-- First circumnavigation in less than two years. (Not a big deal. 180 years earlier it took Cavendish 2 years &amp; 10 weeks; 150 years earlier it took Schouten 2 years &amp; 2 weeks) --&gt;
* [[Samuel Wallis]] and [[Philip Carteret]]; 1766–1768; in {{HMS|Dolphin|1751|6}} and {{HMS|Swallow|1766|6}}; Carteret had served on Byron's expedition. ''Dolphin'' was the '''first ship to survive two circumnavigations'''.
* [[Louis de Bougainville]]; 1766–1769; On board was [[Jeanne Baré]], disguised as a man, the '''first woman to circumnavigate the globe'''; '''first French circumnavigation'''.
* [[James Cook]]; 1768–1771; in {{HMS|Endeavour}}; The '''first circumnavigation to lose no personnel to [[scurvy]]'''.
* [[Tobias Furneaux]]; 1772–1774; in {{HMS|Adventure|1771|6}} (Furneaux was a veteran of Byron's expedition.).

==Fictional circumnavigations==
* [[Jules Verne]]'s 1872 adventure novel, ''[[Around the World in Eighty Days (novel)|Around the World in Eighty Days]]'' describes a fictional circumnavigation. Upper class Englishman [[Phileas Fogg]] and his servant [[Passepartout (character)|Passepartout]] use a variety of transportation means and ingenuity to accomplish the adventurous feat. The book is a tribute to the new transportation possibilities of the early [[Industrial Revolution]], with the coming of [[steamships]], [[railways]], etc., before which a year was a more probable time for a circumnavigation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="115301">This is a list of the world's countries and their [[dependent territory|dependent territories]] by area, ranked by total area.

Entries in this list include, but are not limited to, those in the [[ISO 3166-1]] standard, which includes [[list of sovereign states|sovereign states]] and dependent territories. [[List of states with limited recognition|Largely unrecognised states]] not in ISO 3166-1 are included in the list in ranked order, but are not given a rank number. The areas of such largely unrecognised [[State (polity)|states]] are in most cases also included in the areas of the more widely recognised states that claim the same territory; see the notes in the "notes" column for each country for clarification.

Not included in the list are [[Territorial claims in Antarctica|individual country claims]] to parts of the continent of [[Antarctica]], entities such as the [[European Union]]{{#tag:ref|The [[European Union]] is a unique [[supranational union]]. It covers a total area of {{convert|4479968|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name="ciastats"/&gt; and would be ranked 7th if it were included (3.0% of world's total land area).|group="Note"}} that have some degree of sovereignty but do not consider themselves to be sovereign countries or dependent territories, and unrecognised [[micronation]]s such as the [[Principality of Sealand]].

This list includes three measurements of area:
* '''Total area''': the sum of land and water areas within international boundaries and coastlines.
* '''Land area''': the aggregate of all land within international boundaries and coastlines, excluding water area.
* '''Water area''': the sum of the surface areas of all inland water bodies (lakes, [[reservoir]]s, and rivers) within international boundaries and coastlines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Central Intelligence Agency|title=Definitions and notes: Location|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/docs/notesanddefs.html#2144|work=The World Factbook|publisher=Government of the United States|accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coastal [[internal waters]] (some small [[bays]]) may be included.{{clarify|date=November 2016}} [[Territorial waters]] are not included unless otherwise noted.

Figures for total area and water area also exclude all coastal and territorial waters.{{#tag:ref|The following two primary sources (non-mirrored) represent the range (min./max.) of total area for China and the United States.

Both sources (1) ''exclude'' Taiwan from the area of China; (2) ''exclude'' China's coastal and territorial waters.

However, the CIA World Factbook ''includes'' the United States coastal and territorial waters, while Encyclopædia Britannica ''excludes'' the United States coastal and territorial waters.

{{ordered list
|1= The ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' lists China as world's third-largest country (after [[Russia]] and [[Canada]]) with a total area of 9,572,900 sq km,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/China|title=China|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United States]] as fourth-largest at 9,525,067 sq km.&lt;ref name="United States"/&gt;
|2= The [[The World Factbook|CIA World Factbook]] lists China as fourth-largest country (after Russia, Canada and the United States) with a total area of 9,596,960 sq km,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html |title=China|publisher=CIA|accessdate=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the United States as the third-largest at 9,833,517 sq km.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/us.html|title=United States|publisher=CIA|accessdate=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Notably, Encyclopædia Britannica specifies the United States' area (excluding coastal and territorial waters) as 9,525,067 sq km, which is less than either source's figure given for China's area.&lt;ref name="United States"/&gt; Therefore, while it can be determined that China has a larger area excluding coastal and territorial waters, it is unclear which country has a larger area including coastal and territorial waters.

----

[[United Nations Statistics Division]]'s figure for the United States is 9,833,517 sq km and China is 9,596,961 sq km. These closely match the CIA World Factbook figures and similarly ''include'' coastal and territorial waters for the United States, but ''exclude'' coastal and territorial waters for China.

----

Further explanation of disputed ranking: The dispute for world's third-largest country arose from the inclusion of coastal and territorial waters for the United States. This discrepancy was deduced from comparing the CIA World Factbook and its previous iterations&lt;ref name="31 Years of CIA World Factbook"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theodora.com/wfb/|title=31 Years of CIA World Factbook|publisher=CIA|accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; against the information for United States on ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', particularly its footnote section.&lt;ref name="United States"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/United-States|title=United States|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In sum, according to older versions of the CIA World Factbook (from 1982 to 1996), the US was listed as the world's fourth-largest country (after Russia, Canada, and China) with a total area of 9,372,610 sq km. However, in the 1997 edition, the US added coastal waters to its total area (increasing it to 9,629,091 sq km). And then again in 2007, US added territorial water to its total area (increasing it to 9,833,517 sq km). During this time, China's total area remained unchanged. In other words, ''no'' coastal or territorial water area was added to China's total area figure. The United States has a coastal water area of 109,362 sq km, and a territorial water area of 195,213 sq km, for a total of 304,575 sq km of additional water space. This is larger than entire countries like [[Italy]], [[New Zealand]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. Adding this figure to the US will boost it over China in ranking since China's coastal and territorial water figures are currently unknown (no official publication) and thus cannot be added into China's total area figure.

'''Location intelligence''' ('''LI'''), or '''spatial intelligence''', is the process of deriving meaningful insight from [[geographic data and information|geospatial data]] relationships to solve a particular problem.&lt;ref&gt;Data Resources For Real Estate And Business Geography Analysis. Thrall,G.,I.,Ph.D.(2009)/Professor, Department of Geography, College of Liberal Arts And Sciences and Miller Center For Retail, College of Business, University of Florida&lt;/ref&gt; It involves layering multiple data sets spatially and/or chronologically, for easy reference on a map, and its applications span industries, categories and organizations.

Maps have been used to represent information throughout the ages, but what might be referenced as the first example of true location 'intelligence' was in London in 1854 when [[John Snow]] was able to debunk theories about the spread of cholera by overlaying a map of the area with the location of water pumps and was able to narrow the source to a single water pump. This layering of information over a map was able to identify relationships between different sets of geospatial data.

Location or [[geographical information  system]] (GIS) tools enable spatial experts to collect, store, [[data analysis|analyze]] and [[data visualization|visualize data]]. Location intelligence experts can use a variety of spatial and business analytical tools to measure optimal locations for operating a business or providing a service. Location intelligence experts begin with defining the [[business ecosystem]] which has many interconnected economic influences. Such economic influences include but are not limited to culture, lifestyle, labor, healthcare, cost of living, crime, economic climate and education.

==Further definitions==
The term "location intelligence" is often used to describe the people, data and technology employed to geographically "map" information. These mapping applications can transform large amounts of data into color-coded visual representations that make it easy to see trends and generate meaningful intelligence. The creation of location intelligence is directed by [[domain knowledge]], formal frameworks, and a focus on decision support. Location cuts across through everything i.e. devices, platforms, software and apps, and is one of the most important ingredient of understanding context in sync with social data, mobile data, user data, sensor data.

Location intelligence is also used to describe the integration of a geographical component into [[business intelligence]] processes and tools, often incorporating [[spatial database]] and spatial [[OLAP]] tools.

In 2012, Wayne Gearey from the [[real estate industry]] ([[JLL (company)|JLL]]) offered the first applied course on location intelligence at the University of Texas at Dallas in which he defined location intelligence as the process for selecting the optimal location that will support workplace success and address a variety of business and financial objectives.&lt;ref name="RealViews 2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jllrealviews.com/trends/why-location-intelligence-is-a-game-changer-for-the-property-industry/|title=Why location intelligence is a ‘game changer’ for real estate|last=Avery|first=Lois|date=2015-05-20|website=RealViews|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019164338/https://www.jllrealviews.com/trends/why-location-intelligence-is-a-game-changer-for-the-property-industry/|archive-date=2016-10-19|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=W.M. Gearey, N.M.Trodd, A. Fobes|title=Utilizing Location Intelligence for the Placement of Corporate Services|url=http://www.gla.ac.uk/media/media_401758_en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pitney Bowes]] MapInfo Corporation describes location intelligence as follows: "Spatial information, commonly known as "Location", relates to involving, or having the nature of where. Spatial is not constrained to a geographic location however most common business uses of spatial information deal with how spatial information is tied to a location on the earth. Miriam-Webster® defines Intelligence as "The ability to learn or understand, or the ability to apply knowledge to manipulate one`s environment." Combining these terms alludes to how you achieve an understanding of the spatial aspect of information and apply it to achieve a significant competitive advantage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=George Moon |publisher=Pitney Bowes |url=http://www.pbinsight.com/files/resource-library/resource-files/LocationIntell_WP_2-27Final.pdf |format=PDF |language=en |title=Location Intelligence – Meeting IT Expectation |date=c. 2008 |access-date=2015-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Definition by [[Environmental Systems Research Institute|ESRI]] is as follows: "Location Intelligence is defined as the capacity to organize and understand complex data through the use of geographic relationships. LI organizes business and geographically referenced data to reveal the relationship of location to people, events, transactions, facilities, and assets."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=ESRI |url=https://www.esri.com/~/media/files/pdfs/library/whitepapers/pdfs/using-location-intelligence.pdf |format=PDF |language=en |title=Using Location Intelligence to Maximize the Value of BI |access-date=2015-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Definition by [[Yankee Group]] within their White Paper "Location Intelligence in Retail Banking: "...a business management term that refers to spatial data visualization, contextualization and analytical capabilities applied to solve a business problem."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Marcus Torchia |publisher=Pitney Bowes |url=http://www.pbinsight.com/files/resource-library/resource-files/yankee-group.pdf |format=PDF |language=en |title=Location Intelligence in Retail Banking |date=c. 2009 |access-date=2015-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Near (company)|Near]] defines location intelligence as the gamut of geo-spatial analytic models, algorithms, techniques and tools that harness location-indexed streaming and static data to provide requisite answers to questions around location such as the attributes of i) a place, ii) people visiting a place, and iii) products consumed at a place. Location intelligence platforms encapsulate these technologies, ingest relevant data sources, and provide it as data-as-a-service, or use it to power data-driven products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmaglobal.com/articles/location-intelligence-next-frontier |title= Location Intelligence: The Next Frontier|publisher=Mobile Marketing Association, Inc|date=May 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instarea defines location intelligence as "Using [[machine learning]] algorithms to uncover trends that would be otherwise unknown using human based rules in a large location data set."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/3795764|title=Market Trends: Ways CSPs Can Exploit Location Data|last=|first=|date=|website=Gartner.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''National Conservation Lands''', formally known as the '''National Landscape Conservation System''', is a {{convert|35|e6acre|sing=on}} collection of lands in 873 federally recognized areas considered to be the crown jewels of the [[Western United States|American West]].&lt;ref name=NCL&gt;[https://www.blm.gov/programs/national-conservation-lands National Conservation Lands], [[Bureau of Land Management]]&lt;/ref&gt;  These lands represent 10% of the {{convert|258|e6acre}} managed by the [[Bureau of Land Management]] (BLM). The BLM is the largest federal public land manager and is responsible for over 40% of all the federal public land in the nation. The other major federal public land managers include the [[US Forest Service]] (USFS), [[National Park Service]] (NPS), and the [[US Fish and Wildlife Service]] (USFWS).

Over the years, the Bureau of Land Management has had to adjust its approach to public land management to fit the changing needs of the nation. The BLM historically has managed lands under its jurisdiction for extractive uses, such as mining, logging, grazing, and oil and gas production. In 1983, Congress acknowledged the value of watersheds, wildlife habitat, recreation, scenery, scientific exploration and other non-extractive uses with the designation of the first BLM-managed wilderness area—the Bear Trap Canyon unit of the Lee Metcalf Wilderness in Montana.&lt;ref&gt;wilderness.net&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, President Clinton underscored non-extractive priorities on BLM lands when he established the first national monument to be administered by the BLM—the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in southern Utah. With this and several similar designations, a new focus emerged that would become part of how the agency looks at the land it manages: the protection of special areas where conservation and restoration of the landscape and its biological or cultural resources is the overriding objective.

The Bureau of Land Management's National Landscape Conservation System, better known as the National Conservation Lands, was created in 2000 with the mission to "conserve, protect, and restore these nationally significant landscapes that have outstanding cultural, ecological, and scientific values for the benefit of current and future generations."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blm.gov/nlcs/ National Landscape Conservation System] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060215003855/http://www.blm.gov/nlcs/ |date=2006-02-15 }}, U.S. Bureau of Land Management accessed 5-12-15&lt;/ref&gt;

There are ten different federal conservation designations for the units that make up the National Conservation Lands:

::* [[U.S. National Monument|National Monument]]
::* [[National Conservation Area]]
::* [[National Wilderness Preservation System|Wilderness Area]]
::* [[Wilderness Study Area]]
::* [[National Wild and Scenic Rivers|National Wild and Scenic River]]
::* [[National Scenic Trail]]
::* [[National Historic Trail]]
::* [[Cooperative Management and Protection Area]]
::* [[Forest reserve|Forest Reserve]]
::* [[Outstanding Natural Area]]

The Conservation System was created in 2000, but without Congressional authorization, there was no guarantee that the System would be permanent. The National Landscape Conservation System Act was signed into law in March 2009. The Act permanently unified the individual units as a public lands System, protecting the System in law so that it would no longer exist at the pleasure of each president. This marked the first new congressionally authorized public lands system in decades.  

The Conservation System act was included in the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009, which also added {{convert|1200000|acre}} of new designations to the System, including a National Monument, three National Conservation Areas, Wilderness, Wild and Scenic Rivers and National Scenic Trails.

A '''notice to mariners''' (NTM&lt;ref&gt;Web site uses abbreviation NTM&lt;/ref&gt;) advises mariners of important matters affecting navigational safety, including new [[Hydrography|hydrographic information]], changes in [[channel (geography)|channel]]s and aids to [[navigation]], and other important data.

Over 60 countries which produce nautical charts also
produce a notice to mariners. About one third of these are
weekly, another third are bi-monthly or monthly, and the
rest irregularly issued according to need. For example, the [[United Kingdom Hydrographic Office]] issues weekly updates.

==United States==

The U.S. ''Notice to Mariners'' is made available weekly by the [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]] (NGA), prepared jointly with the [[National Ocean Service]] (NOS) and the [[U.S. Coast Guard]]. The information in the ''Notice to Mariners'' is formatted to simplify the correction of [[nautical chart|paper charts]], ''[[List of Lights]]'', ''[[Light List]]s'', ''[[United States Coast Pilots]]'', and other publications produced by NGA, NOS, and the U.S. Coast Guard.

Information for the ''Notice to Mariners'' is contributed
by: the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (Department of Defense) for waters
outside the territorial limits of the United States; National
Ocean Service ([[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]],
[[Department of Commerce]]), which is charged
with surveying and charting the coasts and harbors of the
United States and its territories; the U.S. Coast Guard ([[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]]) which is responsible for the safety of life at sea and the establishment and operation of aids to navigation; and the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] ([[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]), which is charged with the
improvement of rivers and harbors of the United States. In
addition, important contributions are made by foreign hydrographic
offices and cooperating observers of all
nationalities.

The Notice consists of a page of Hydrograms listing
important items in the Notice, a chart correction
section organized by ascending chart number, a product catalog corrections section, a publications
correction section, a summary of broadcast
navigation warnings, and a page of additional miscellaneous information. It is the responsibility of users to decide which of their
charts and publications require correction.
Mariners are requested to cooperate in the correction of
charts and publications by reporting all discrepancies between
published information and conditions actually
observed and by recommending appropriate improvements. A reporting form is provided in the back of each
''Notice to Mariners''.

Issue No. 1 of each year contains important
information on a variety of subjects which supplements
information not usually found on charts and in navigational
publications. This information is published as Special Notice
to Mariners Paragraphs. Additional items considered
of interest to the mariner are also included in this Notice.

Much of the data
in the U.S. ''Notice to Mariners'' is obtained from foreign
notices.

==Canada==
In Canada, the Canadian Coast Guard (CCG) [http://www.notmar.gc.ca/ Notice to Mariners] publication informs mariners of important navigational safety matters affecting Canadian Waters.  This electronic publication is published on a monthly basis and can be downloaded from the [http://www.notmar.gc.ca/go.php?doc=eng/services/notmar/index Notices to Mariners (NOTMAR) Web site].  The information in the Notice to Mariners is formatted to simplify the correction of paper charts and navigational publications.

The [http://www.notmar.gc.ca/ NOTMAR.gc.ca] site is a free 24/7 service providing mariners with up-to-date safety advisories.   It provides mariners with a quick and easy to use interface to access Notices to Mariners information. This system also generates [http://www.notmar.gc.ca/search/mycharts-eng.php?czozMDoibnRtPXN0ZXBfb25lc3RhcnQmYWNjZXB0cHJpdj0xIjs= weekly and monthly notification mailers], for its registered users.  These on-line mail services provides the [http://www.notmar.gc.ca/subscribe/ monthly Notices to Mariners publications] as well as the weekly(section II - chart corrections) notices that advise the mariner of the notices that have been issued against their chart selections.  These mail services simplify the process for registered clients to update their publications and charts as required under the Canada Shipping Act.

The NOTMAR web site also includes the [http://www.notmar.gc.ca/go.php?doc=eng/services/notmar/numindex historical Chart corrections] and [http://www.notmar.gc.ca/go.php?doc=eng/services/notmar/sec4index historical Sailing Direction corrections]; as well, it provides access to downloadable Chart Patches, contains links to CHS’s Chart Number 1, instructions for applying Notices to mariners to manually update their paper charts, and other useful information.

==Summary of Corrections==
A close companion to the ''Notice to Mariners'' is the '''[http://msi.nga.mil/MSISiteContent/StaticFiles/SOCDownloadPage.htm Summary of Corrections]'''. The ''Summary'' is published in five volumes. Each volume covers a major portion of the earth including several chart regions and many subregions.  Volume 5 also includes special charts and publications corrected
by the ''Notice to Mariners''. Since the Summaries contain cumulative corrections, any chart, regardless of its print date, can be corrected with the proper volume of the Summary and all subsequent ''Notice to Mariners''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17997">[[File:Clarke principal triangulation of Britain 1860.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.4|The principal triangulation mesh over Britain.]] 
The '''Principal Triangulation of Britain''' was the first high-precision [[trigonometry|trigonometric]] [[surveying|survey]] of the whole of Great Britain (including Ireland), carried out between 1791 and 1853 under the auspices of the [[Board of Ordnance]]. The aim of the survey was to establish precise geographical coordinates of almost 300 significant landmarks which could be used as the fixed points of local topographic surveys from which maps could be drawn. In addition there was a purely scientific aim in providing precise data for geodetic calculations such as the determination of the length of [[meridian arc]]s and the [[figure of the Earth]]. Such a  survey had  been proposed by [[William Roy]] (1726–1790) on his completion of the [[Anglo-French Survey (1784–1790)|Anglo-French Survey]] but it was only after his death that the  [[Board of Ordnance]] initiated the trigonometric survey, motivated by military considerations in a time of a threatened French invasion. Most of the work was carried out under the direction of [[s:Dalby, Isaac (DNB00)|Isaac Dalby]],  [[William Mudge]] and [[Thomas Frederick Colby]], but the final synthesis and report (1858) was the work of [[Alexander Ross Clarke]]. The survey stood the test of time for a century, until the [[Retriangulation of Great Britain]] between 1935 and 1962.

==History==
In the aftermath of the [[Jacobite rising of 1745]] it was recognised that there was a need for an accurate map of the [[Scottish Highlands]] and the necessary survey was initiated in 1747 by Lieutenant-Colonel David Watson, a Deputy Quartermaster-General of the [[Board of Ordnance]]. Watson employed William Roy as a civilian assistant to carry out the bulk of the work. Subsequently, Roy, having enlisted in the army and having become a very competent surveyor, proposed (1763) a national survey which would be a plan for defence at a time when French invasions were threatened.  The proposal was rejected on grounds of expense.&lt;ref&gt;The early history of the Ordnance Survey is covered in {{harvtxt|Owen|Pilbeam|1992}} pp 3–14(true), 12–24(pdf), and {{harvtxt|Seymour|1980}} pp. 1–20 (true), 15–35(pdf).&lt;/ref&gt;

Roy continued to lobby for a survey and his ambitions were realised to a certain extent by an unexpected development. In 1783 the [[French Academy of Sciences]] claimed that the latitude and longitude differences between the  [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich]] and the [[Paris Observatory]] were incorrect, and it was proposed (to the  [[Royal Society]]) that the differences could be reconciled by high precision triangulation over the intervening terrain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knowles|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Royal Society agreed and, jointly with the Board of Ordnance, they invited Roy to oversee the project. (Main article; [[Anglo-French Survey (1784–1790)]].)

Roy's first task (1784) was to measure a base line  between [[Hampton, London|Hampton]] Poor House and King's Arbour on [[Hounslow Heath]], a distance of just over 5 miles (8&amp;nbsp;km).&lt;ref&gt;A full account of the measurement of the Hounslow Heath baseline is given in {{harvtxt|Roy|1785}}. The appendix includes detailed maps and figures.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a painstaking process: three rods of about 20&amp;nbsp;ft. were supported on trestles and the ends aligned to an accuracy of a thousandth part of an inch. The first rod was then carried to the end of the third, an operation to be repeated 1370 times. The final measurement gave the length of the base as 27404.01&amp;nbsp;ft. (8352 metres).

[[File:RamsdenRS theodolite of 1787.jpg|thumb|upright|The first Ramsden theodolite as used by Roy. (Destroyed by war damage in 1941.)]] For the subsequent triangulation&lt;ref&gt;The strategy of the triangulation is outlined in {{harvtxt|Roy|1787}}. The appendix includes detailed maps and figures.&lt;/ref&gt; Roy ordered a new [[theodolite]] from leading instrument-maker [[Jesse Ramsden]]. This [[Ramsden theodolite]], delivered in 1787, for the first time divided angular scales accurately to within a [[arcsecond|second of arc]].&lt;ref&gt;A full description of the first Ramsden theodolite is given in {{harvtxt|Roy|1790}}. The appendix includes detailed figures.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The theodolite constructed for Roy by Ramsden is called the Royal Society theodolite. See  {{harvnb|Insley|2008}} ''The Great Theodolites''&lt;/ref&gt; The theodolite was the largest ever constructed but, despite its massive size, it was carried from London to the Channel coast and employed on hills, steeples and a moveable tower. At each location the angles to other vertices of the triangulation mesh were measured many times, often at night time using newly devised lights. Finally the angle data was used to calculate the sides of the triangles by using [[spherical trigonometry]].&lt;ref&gt;Roy's final report, which was put through the press by Isaac Dalby, is {{harvtxt|Roy|1790}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:3foottheodoliteramsden.jpg|thumb|upright|The second Ramsden theodolite as  purchased by the Board Ordnance. Now in the [[Science Museum, London]]]] The final results were inconclusive, for triangulation was inferior to the precision of astronomical measurements, but the survey paved the way for all future work in terms of high precision measurements of length and angle, together with the techniques of calculating on an ellipsoidal surface. In his final report, published posthumously, Roy once again pressed for the extension of the survey to the rest of Britain. His successors would oblige. As Master of the Board of Ordnance (from 1782), Charles Lennox, 3rd Duke of Richmond, viewed Roy's work with great interest, At the same time he was acutely aware that Britain, lacking a national survey, was falling behind the standards of many other European countries. Moreover, the renewed threat of French invasion made him alarmed at  the lack of accurate maps, particularly of the southern counties. The catalyst for action was the sudden availability of a new improved Ramsden theodolite&lt;ref&gt;The Ramsden theodolite purchase by Richmond is referred to as The Board of Ordnance theodolite. See  {{harvnb|Insley|2008}} ''The Great Theodolites''&lt;/ref&gt; which had been intended for the [[East India Company]]. The purchase of this instrument on 21 June 1791 by the Board is taken as the inauguration of the [[Ordnance Survey]].&lt;ref&gt;An official [https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/blog/2016/06/celebrating-225-years-with-a-map/ OS blog] celebrating 225 years of British mapping.&lt;/ref&gt; The very next day Richmond appointed [[s:Dalby, Isaac (DNB00)|Isaac Dalby]] as its first employee, with a brief to extend Roy's survey.&lt;ref&gt;Dalby was a civilian mathematician who had assisted Roy from 1787. See  {{harvtxt|Owen|Pilbeam|1992}} p11(true), 21(pdf), and {{harvtxt|Seymour|1980}} p22(true),36(pdf).&lt;/ref&gt; In the following month Richmond appointed [[William Mudge]] and Edward Williams, the latter as the first superintendent of the survey.

&lt;!--The baseline derived during that work, together with the new theodolite, served as the basis for the planning and execution of the subsequent work on the Principal Triangulation. Around 1791, shortly after his death, Roy's team began the field work, using the specially built Ramsden theodolite. In 1794 a seven-mile-long baseline of verification was measured on [[Salisbury Plain]].

Eventually the triangulation extended to cover the whole of the British Isles, after it was decided in 1824 that a 6-inch-to-the-mile (1:10,560) [[map]] of [[Ireland]] was necessary for accurate land taxing.
--&gt;

==Re-measurement of the Hounslow baseline==
[[File:General Roys Baseline.jpg|right|thumb|General Roy's baseline: map as about 1935]]
For the 1784 measurement of the original base-line across Hounslow Heath, Roy had ordered three deal rods cut from a new mast in the Admiralty dock yards. These were intended to be used for the precision measurement but Roy also ordered  a 100&amp;nbsp;ft steel chain from Ramsden which could be used for a quick preliminary measurement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Roy|1785}} Section&amp;nbsp;I&lt;/ref&gt; The deal rods proved ineffective because of their changes with humidity and they were replaced with glass rods for the final measurement; however Roy observed that the chain itself was just as accurate as the rods. For this reason the 1791 survey started by remeasuring the base with two new 100&amp;nbsp;ft chains, the second to be kept unused as a reference against which any stretching of the first would be detected.

The process of measurement was exceedingly precise.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Mudge|1794}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Since the ground was undulating and falling about 370&amp;nbsp;ft. along the length of the base, the measurement was carried out over 26 stages with varying slopes, the chains for any one stage being constrained to a perfectly straight line by many intermediate supports. These hypotenuse measurements were then projected to the horizontal. Furthermore, the temperature varied from day to day and each measurement was corrected to the length that a chain would take at 62&amp;nbsp;°F. Finally, the length of the base was reduced to its projection at sea level using the height of the south base above the Thames and the fall in the Thames down to its estuary. The final result was approximately 3&amp;nbsp;inches less than that of Roy and the mean value of 27404.2&amp;nbsp;ft. was taken of the baseline. The difference of the two values meant that the accuracy of the measurement could be claimed to be 1&amp;nbsp;inch in 27,404&amp;nbsp;ft, which is 3 parts per million.

==Corrections==
During subsequent triangulation, errors due to atmospheric refraction, deflection of plumb-bobs, temperature, and the spherical nature of the earth (meaning there were [[Spherical geometry|more than 180 degrees in a triangle]]) were all allowed for.

'''Right to light''' is a form of [[easement]] in [[English law]] that gives a long-standing owner of a building with windows a right to maintain the level of [[illumination (lighting)|illumination]]. It is based on the '''Ancient Lights''' law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fpkDAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Ancient+lights+%22&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |title=On ancient lights: and the evidence ... - Google Books |publisher=books.google.co.uk |accessdate=2010-02-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rights are most usually acquired under the [[Prescription Act 1832]].

==Rights==
In effect, the owner of a building with windows that have received natural daylight for 20 years or more is entitled to forbid any construction or other obstruction that would deprive him or her of that illumination. Neighbours cannot build anything that would block the light without permission. The owner may build more or larger windows but cannot enlarge their new windows before the new period of 20 years has expired. It is also possible for a right to light to exist if granted expressly by [[deed]], or granted implicitly, for example under the rule in ''[[Wheeldon v Burrows|Wheeldon v. Burrows]]'' (1879).

Once a right to light exists, the owner of the right is entitled to "sufficient light according to the ordinary notions of mankind": ''[[Colls v. Home &amp; Colonial Stores Ltd]]'' (1904). Courts rely on [[expert witnesses]] to define this term. Since the 1920s, experts have used a method proposed by [[Percy Waldram]] to assist them with this. Waldram suggested that ordinary people require one [[foot-candle]] of [[illuminance]] (approximately ten [[lux]]) for reading and other work involving visual discrimination. This equates to a [[sky factor]] (similar to the [[daylight factor]]) of 0.2%. Today, Waldram's methods are increasingly subject to criticism&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emeraldinsight.com/Insight/viewContentItem.do;jsessionid=D62CF262C987771E9EA2A8DB73A9A48F?contentType=Article&amp;contentId=1603352 Was Waldram wrong?], P Defoe, ''[[Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors]]'', 19 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Pitts (2000), [http://www.emeraldinsight.com/Insight/viewContentItem.do?contentType=Article&amp;hdAction=lnkpdf&amp;contentId=844738 The grumble point: is it still worth the candle?], ''[[Structural Survey]]'' '''18'''(5):255–8&lt;/ref&gt; and the future of expert evidence in rights to light cases is currently the subject of much debate within the surveying profession.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rics.org/Practiceareas/Property/Rightstolight/Rights%20to%20light%20the%20debate.html Rights to light surveying practice, the debate begins], Paul Chynoweth, ''[[Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors]]'', 21 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Second World War]], owners of buildings could gain new rights by registering properties that had been destroyed in [[bombing]]s and the period was temporarily increased to 27 years.

In the centre of [[London]] near [[Chinatown, London|Chinatown]] and [[Covent Garden]], particularly in back alleyways, signs saying "Ancient Lights" can be seen marking individual windows. The design and construction of [[Broadcasting House]] in the early 1930s was also affected by locals declaring their right to ancient lights. It resulted in a unique asymmetrical sloped design that allowed for sunlight to pass over the building to the residential quarters eastwards, long since demolished and now home to the new Egton Wing.

Recent case law from 2010, relating to a commercial development in the centre of Leeds ([http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2010/2245.html ''HKRUK II v Heaney'']) has significantly changed the perceptions of risk associated with right-to-light, particularly in the context of commercial schemes.  This case upheld an injunction against a commercial property. The result of this is that many developers are now looking to work with local authorities to try to use section 237 of the [[Town and Country Planning Act 1990]].  This potentially stops injunctions against schemes that have over-riding social or economic advantages to an area.

=== United States ===
Under [[United States tort law]], in ''[[Fontainebleau Hotel]] Corp. v. Forty-Five Twenty-Five, Inc.'' (1959) the Florida [[Appellate Court]] stated that the "ancient lights" doctrine had been unanimously repudiated in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.american.edu/dgolash/fontainebleau%20v.%204525.htm FOUNTAINEBLEAU HOTEL CORP., a Florida corporation, and Charnofree Corporation, a Florida corporation, Appellants, v.

In 1984, voters in [[San Francisco]] passed Proposition K, which prevents construction of any building over 40 feet that casts a shadow on a public park, unless the Planning Commission decides the shadow is insignificant. This proposition causes problems for [[Oceanwide_Center,_San_Francisco|a proposed 34-story building south of Market Street]], which would cast a shadow on a public park ten blocks away, for one hour of the day in the fall, as well as St. Mary's Square, Justin Herman Plaza, and Union Square for significant parts of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dineen|first1=J.K.|title=Long shadows create political hurdle for S.F. skyscraper project|url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Long-shadows-create-political-hurdle-for-S-F-7382467.php|accessdate=30 June 2017|publisher=SF Chronicle|date=April 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Massachusetts]] has similar laws against the casting of shadows on [[Boston Common]], the [[Public_Garden_(Boston)|Public Garden]], and other important public open spaces.&lt;ref&gt;http://archives.lib.state.ma.us/actsResolves/1990/1990acts0362.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Scott Polar Research Institute''' ('''SPRI''') is a centre for research into the [[polar region]]s and [[glaciology]] worldwide. It is a sub-department of the [[Department of Geography, University of Cambridge|Department of Geography]] in the [[University of Cambridge]], located on [[Lensfield Road]] in the south of [[Cambridge]] ({{coord|52|11|54.40|N|0|07|34.45|E}}).

==Purpose==
[[File:Bust Scott Geograph-1422431-by-Keith-Edkins.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Bust of [[Robert Falcon Scott]] by [[Kathleen Scott]]]]
[[File:Youth-lawrence-cambridge-2017.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The statue of 'Youth' (1920) by Kathleen Scott for which [[A. W. Lawrence]] was the model]]
SPRI was founded by [[Frank Debenham]] in 1920 as the national memorial to Captain [[Robert Falcon Scott]] and his companions, who died on their return journey from the [[South Pole]] in 1912. It investigates issues relevant to the [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]] in the [[environmental science]]s, [[social sciences]] and [[humanities]]. The institute has some 60 personnel, consisting of academic, library and support staff plus postgraduate students, associates and fellows attached to research programmes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spri.cam.ac.uk/ Welcome to SPRI] Scott Polar Research Institute. Accessed 28 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The institute also hosts the [[Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research]], and is part of the [[Natural Environment Research Council|NERC]] Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling.

==Resources==
The Grade II listed main building  (1933–34) is by [[Sir Herbert Baker]]. The  small halls have shallow domed ceilings painted with the aspect of the globe from north and south poles, by [[MacDonald Gill]].&lt;ref name="NHLE"&gt;{{National Heritage List for England entry| num=1268369 |desc=Scott Polar Research Institute |grade=II |accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Scott Polar Research Institute houses the world's most comprehensive polar library and archives.&lt;ref name= "SPRI website"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spri.cam.ac.uk/library/overview.html|title=Scott Polar Research Institute, Cambridge » Library|author=|date=|website=www.spri.cam.ac.uk|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute's [[Thomas Henry Manning|Thomas H. Manning]] Archive contains an unparalleled collection of manuscript material relating to the polar regions, research and exploration. For scientists and scholars, the library offers a collection developed since the 1920s covering all subjects relating to the Arctic, the Antarctic, and to ice and snow wherever found. For industry, it is a prime information source on such subjects as exploration and exploitation of natural resources and on the environmental implications of such activities in the polar regions; on the design of ice-strengthened shipping and selection of sea routes; and on problems of construction and transportation in cold environments. The library also offers an unrivalled resource for the needs of international relations and strategic defence.

The Picture Library contains a photograph collection from both the Arctic and Antarctic, mainly depicting the history of exploration in the polar regions, including much material from the expeditions of Scott and Shackleton. Its [[Thomas Henry Manning|Thomas H. Manning]] Polar Archives are named in honour of the British-Canadian Arctic researcher, a university alumnus.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/25/world/thomas-manning-86-explorer-known-as-lone-wolf-of-arctic.html|title=Thomas Manning, 86, Explorer Known as Lone Wolf of Arctic|last=Kaufman|first=Michael T.|date=25 November 1998|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|accessdate=20 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its work includes an [[oral history]] programme which interviews people who have worked in the polar regions over the years. Due to high demand, the Polar Archives runs a booking scheme for anyone wishing to consult material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spri.cam.ac.uk/library/archives/|title=Scott Polar Research Institute, Cambridge » Polar Archives|author=|date=|website=www.spri.cam.ac.uk|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The most recent addition to the library is the [[Ernest Shackleton|Shackleton]] Memorial Library, which in 1999 won a regional award from the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spri.cam.ac.uk/library/building/ The Shackleton Memorial Library] Scott Polar Research Institute. Accessed 28 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This part of the building holds much of the library's Antarctic collection, as well as some of its subject-based material.

The library is part of the Inspire Libraries scheme&lt;ref&gt;http://inspire-libraries.org.uk/participating-libraries/?task=view&amp;id=1558&lt;/ref&gt; and is open to anyone with a polar interest to use for reference work and research.

==The Polar Museum==

SPRI operates the '''Polar Museum''', which presents a range of objects, artworks, documents and photographs from the Institute's extensive polar collections. The collections include material related to polar history, exploration, science, art and Arctic cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Museum Catalogue|url=https://www.spri.cam.ac.uk/museum/catalogue/|website=Scott Polar Research Institute – Museum Collections|publisher=Scott Polar Research Institute, University of Cambridge|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Picture Library Catalogue|url=https://www.spri.cam.ac.uk/picturelibrary/catalogue/|website=Scott Polar Research Institute – Picture Library Collections|publisher=Scott Polar Research Institute, University of Cambridge|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archive Catalogue|url=https://www.spri.cam.ac.uk/archives/catalogue//|website=Scott Polar Research Institute – Archive Collections|publisher=Scott Polar Research Institute, University of Cambridge|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 the renovated Polar Museum opened its doors to the public; the reopening was met with widespread acclaim and the museum was shortlisted for the [[Art Fund]]'s [[Museum of the Year]] prize in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.artfund.org/news/2011/05/24/getting-to-know-the-polar-museum|title=Getting to know... The Polar Museum|last=Fund|first=Art|work=Art Fund|access-date=28 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum welcomed 52,392 visitors in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ALVA – Association of Leading Visitor Attractions|url=http://www.alva.org.uk/details.cfm?p=423|website=www.alva.org.uk|accessdate=18 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contains displays of Arctic art and artefacts, material from the nineteenth century search for the Northwest Passage, the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration (including the last letters of Captain Scott) and contemporary research and policy relating to the polar regions.

Important material cared for by the Scott Polar Research Institute and on display in the Polar Museum includes:
* A folding camera used by [[Robert Falcon Scott]] at the South Pole, 1912, on the British Antarctic Expedition 1910–13 (Terra Nova).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Museum catalogue – Antarctic Collection – Camera|url=https://www.spri.cam.ac.uk/museum/catalogue/article/y2006.14/|website=Scott Polar Research Institute|publisher=Scott Polar Research Institute, University of Cambridge|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A reindeer-skin sleeping bag used by [[Lawrence Oates|Captain Lawrence Oates]] during the journey to the South Pole on the British Antarctic Expedition 1910–13 (Terra Nova). The bag was found on 12 November 1912 by the search party looking for the polar party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Museum catalogue – Antarctic Collection – Sleeping bag|url=https://www.spri.cam.ac.uk/museum/catalogue/article/n857/|website=Scott Polar Research Institute|publisher=Scott Polar Research Institute, University of Cambridge|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A sextant used for navigation by [[Frank Worsley|Captain Frank Worsley]] on the [[Voyage of the James Caird|James Caird]] during the Ernest Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition 1914–16 (''[[Endurance (1912 ship)|Endurance]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Museum catalogue – Antarctic Collection – Sextant|url=https://www.spri.cam.ac.uk/museum/catalogue/article/y2010.75/|website=Scott Polar Research Institute|publisher=Scott Polar Research Institute, University of Cambridge|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wide ranging collections include art and photographic works by several notable artists and photographers, including:
*[[Herbert Ponting]]
*[[Kenojuak Ashevak]]
*[[Kathleen Scott]]
*[[Edward Adrian Wilson]]
*[[Isobel Wylie Hutchison]]
*[[Sidney Nolan]]
*[[Frank Hurley]]
*[[Pudlo Pudlat]]

The Institute is actively adding to its collection of contemporary polar art through its artist in residence scheme, managed by the Friends of SPRI, which enables an artist to travel to the Antarctic and the Arctic each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Artists in Residence|url=https://www.spri.cam.ac.uk/friends/artistinresidence/|website=Scott Polar Research Institute|publisher=Scott Polar Research Institute, University of Cambridge|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as permanent exhibits, the museum regularly hosts special exhibitions. The museum is open Tuesdays to Saturdays, 10:00 – 16:00, and admission is free.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spri.cam.ac.uk/museum/ Museum] Polar Museum. Accessed 9 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum is one of the eight museums and botanic garden which make up the [[University of Cambridge Museums]] consortium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/museums-and-collections/visit-us/our-museums|title=Our Museums|first=Jo|last=McPhee|date=6 August 2013|website=www.cam.ac.uk|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
SPRI has several research groups.

===Glaciology and Climate Change Group===
This group's work involves quantifying the state of the [[cryosphere]] using remote sensing by satellites, plus accurate field measurements and computer simulations, to understand the processes in detail. In particular, the group has been able to observe the melting of the [[Larsen Ice Shelf]], the rapid retreat of ice in western Antarctica, and increased summer melting in northern Canada. This work has contributed greatly to understanding [[global warming|climate change]].

===Glacimarine Environments Group===
This group's work focuses on the dynamics of ice-sheets and delivery of sediment to the marine environment. The group uses geophysical and geological evidence gathered by [[icebreaker]]s in the polar seas.

===Polar Landscape and Remote Sensing Group===
This group's work focuses on the processes which modify the polar and sub-polar environments, such as Arctic vegetation, and snow and ice cover. Improving techniques for measuring vegetation from satellite data is an important part of the work.

===Polar Social Science and Humanities Group===
This is an interdisciplinary group covering the anthropology, history and art of the Arctic. Its work includes looking at politics and environmental management in the polar regions, with particular expertise in the religion, culture and politics of the [[Russia]]n North.

It was the most accurate large-area survey ever done prior to [[Global Positioning System]] surveys. TCT included over 2,700 survey stations, covered over 13,600 miles, and passed through 44 states.&lt;ref&gt;[https://celebrating200years.noaa.gov/magazine/tct/welcome.html#trans The High-precision Transcontinental Traverse: Improving the Scale of the U.S. Survey Network], NOAA (page "the traverse") &lt;/ref&gt;  

This nationwide survey increased the accuracy of the existing U.S. survey network. It was also fundamental to the sophisticated mathematical readjustment of the nation's survey network known as the [[North American Datum of 1983]].&lt;ref name=NOAA-PD&gt;{{citation|title=The High-precision Transcontinental Traverse: Improving the Scale of the U.S. Survey Network|work=NOAA Celebrates 200 years|type=website|publisher=U.S. [[National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration]]|url=https://celebrating200years.noaa.gov/magazine/tct/welcome.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the "end of an era" as the last conventional, purely terrestrial large scale survey.{{sfn|Wilford2001|p=366}}

==Forerunner surveys==
The first major transcontinental survey was the Transcontinental Arc of Triangulation, completed in 1896 along the [[39th parallel north]] with coastal endpoints at [[Cape May, New Jersey]], and [[Point Arena, California]] lighthouses. It established the [[Meades Ranch]] survey marker, also called the Geodetic Center of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Meades Ranch|author=Jerry Penry|date=June 4, 2015|work=The American Surveyor|publisher=Cheves Media|url=http://www.amerisurv.com/content/view/13900/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/web/about_ngs/history/milestones.shtml Milestones of the Survey], National Geodetic Survey, June 5, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The Transcontinental Traverse, commonly known as the "TCT", grew out of smaller surveying projects that the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey (C&amp;GS) conducted for the U.S. Air Force missile-tracking program in an area near Cape Canaveral, Florida, during the 1960s.  C&amp;GS developed unique specifications for this work that resulted in one part in 1,000,000, exceeding Air Force requirements.&lt;ref&gt;[https://celebrating200years.noaa.gov/magazine/tct/welcome.html#capec Cape Canaveral Triangulation Survey Yields High-Precision Results], NOAA&lt;/ref&gt; This led C&amp;GS officials to conclude that applying the same specifications to a nationwide traverse, a surveying method, would dramatically improve the scale of the entire U.S. survey network. Soon after completing its work for the Air Force in Florida in 1961, C&amp;GS embarked on the TCT.&lt;ref name=NOAA-PD/&gt;

==Route and history==
The Geodimeter electronic distance measurement device was rapidly tested and adopted by national agencies for long-distance mapping. The last base line to be measured with tape happened near [[Salmon, Idaho]] in 1958.&lt;ref name=Dracup/&gt;

The survey began in 1961 in Florida and ended in 1976 in Michigan. It crisscrossed North America along three east-west and five north-south corridors. A portion that had been planned to traverse the US-Canada border to Maine was canceled due to advances in [[satellite geodesy]].&lt;ref name=Dracup&gt;{{citation|title=GEODETIC SURVEYING 1940 - 1990|author=Joseph F.

[[File:New York's Finger Lakes.jpg|thumb|280px|right|[[New York (state)|New York]]'s [[Finger Lakes]]. Lying south of Lake Ontario, the Finger Lakes formed in tunnel valleys.]]
A '''tunnel valley''' is a large, long, [[U-shaped valley]] originally cut under the [[glacial ice]] near the margin of continental ice sheets such as that now covering Antarctica and formerly covering portions of all continents during past [[ice ages|glacial ages]].&lt;ref name=J&gt;{{Cite journal  | last =   Jørgensen | first =Flemming   | authorlink =   |author2=Peter B.E. Sandersen   | title = Buried and open tunnel valleys in Denmark—erosion beneath multiple ice sheets  | journal = Quaternary Science Reviews  | volume = 25  | issue = 11–12  | pages = 1339–1363  | publisher =   | location =   | date = June 2006  | url =   | issn =   | doi = 10.1016/j.quascirev.2005.11.006     | id =   |bibcode = 2006QSRv...25.1339J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A tunnel valley can be as long as {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}}, {{convert|4|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide, and {{convert|400|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep (its depth may vary along its length).

Tunnel valleys were formed by subglacial erosion by water and served as subglacial drainage pathways carrying large volumes of melt water. Their cross-sections exhibit steep-sided flanks similar to [[fjord]] walls, and their flat bottoms are typical of subglacial glacial erosion.

They presently appear as dry valleys, lakes, seabed depressions, and as areas filled with sediment. If they are filled with sediment, their lower layers are filled primarily with glacial, [[glacio-fluvial|glaciofluvial]] or [[glaciolacustrine deposits|glaciolacustrine]] sediment, supplemented by upper layers of temperate infill.&lt;ref name=Stucki2010&gt;{{Cite journal  | last =   Durst Stucki | first =Mirjam   | authorlink =   | author2 = Regina Reber and Fritz Schlunegger  | title = Subglacial tunnel valleys in the Alpine foreland: an example from Bern, Switzerland  | journal = Swiss Journal of Geosciences | volume =   103| issue =   3| pages =   363–374| publisher =  Springer (Online First) | location =   | date = June 2010  | url =   | issn =   | doi = 10.1007/s00015-010-0042-0     | id =   }}&lt;/ref&gt; They can be found in areas formerly covered by glacial ice sheets including Africa, Asia, North America, Europe, Australia and offshore in the North Sea, the Atlantic and in waters near Antarctica.

Tunnel valleys appear in the technical literature under several terms, including tunnel channels, subglacial valleys, [[iceway]]s, [[Snake coils (geology)|snake coils]] and linear incisions.

==Significance==
Understanding tunnel valleys is important because: 
* They serve as a marker for areas with the potential for effective oil exploration in Africa
* Their bedrock boundaries and glacial infill makes them effective aquifers in many regions
* Soil engineers must accommodate the variations which they exhibit when boring tunnels and establishing foundations
* They provide one of several signatures marking the edge of former glaciations

Tunnel valleys play a useful role in identifying oil rich areas in [[Arabia]] and [[North Africa]]. The Upper [[Ordovician]]–Lower [[Silurian]] materials there contain a roughly {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on}} thick, carbon-rich layer of black shale. Approximately 30% of the world's oil is found in these shale deposits. Although the origin of these deposits is still under study,  it has been established that the shale routinely overlies glacial and glacio-marine sediment deposited ~445 million years before the present by the [[Hirnantian|Hirnantian glaciation]]. The shale has been linked to glacial meltwater nutrient enrichment of the shallow marine environment. Hence the presence of tunnel valleys is an indicator of the presence of oil in these areas.&lt;ref name=Armstrong2009&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Armstrong| first =Howard A. | authorlink = | author2 = Geoffrey D.

Tunnel valleys represent a substantial fraction of all melt-water drainage from glaciers. Melt-water drainage influences the flow of glacial ice, which is important in understanding of the duration of glacial–interglacial periods and aids in identifying glacial cyclicity, a problem that is important to palaeoenvironmental investigations.&lt;ref name=Smellie2008A&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Smellie | first = John L. | authorlink = | author2 = J.S.

Tunnel valleys are typically eroded into bedrock and filled with glacial debris of varying sizes. This configuration makes them excellent at capturing and storing water. Hence they serve an important role as [[aquifer]]s across much of [[Northern Europe]], [[Canada]] and the [[United States]].  Examples include [[Oak Ridges Moraine| Oak Ridges Moraine Aquifer]], Spokane Valley-Rathdrum Prairie Aquifer, [[Mahomet Aquifer]], the [http://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2009AM/finalprogram/abstract_164191.htm Saginaw Lobe Aquifer], and the [http://pubs.usgs.gov/ha/ha730/ch_m/M-text1.html Corning Aquifer].

==Characteristics==
[[File:Tunneldal Noordbergum.jpg|280px|left|thumb|A figure in Dutch showing the cross-section of a tunnel valley which has been refilled after erosion into bedrock.]]

===Buried, open and partially filled===
Tunnel valleys have been observed as open valleys and as partially or totally buried valleys.  If buried they may be partially or totally filled with glacial outwash or other debris. The valleys may be incised in bedrock, sand, silt, or clay.&lt;ref name=J/&gt;

A part of a tunnel valley may go uphill: water can flow uphill if it is under pressure in an enclosed pipe: for example in [[Doggerland]] (submerged land which is now part of the bed of the [[North Sea]]) are some infilled tunnel valleys that flowed from north to south across the hollow of the [[Outer Silver Pit]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=SrsrE8oZx44C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=Doggerland&amp;ots=YzrIXDuQeI&amp;sig=DaeFOytqn6t-JpW1-zBTGqVqO50#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Vincent Gaffney, Kenneth Thomson, Simon Finch, Mapping Doggerland: The Mesolithic Landscapes of the Southern North Sea, University of Birmingham, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dimensions===
They vary in channel depth and width; Danish examples run from {{convert|0.5|-|4|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide and from {{convert|50|–|350|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep.  They vary in depth/altitude along their course, exhibiting [[overdeepening]]; overdeepened sections cut into bedrock and typically are significantly deeper than either upstream or downstream sections of the same tunnel valley. They have steep sides which are frequently [[asymmetric valley|asymmetric]].&lt;ref name=J/&gt;

Tunnel valleys frequently include relatively straight individual segments parallel to and independent of one another. Tunnel valley courses may be periodically interrupted; the interruption may include a stretch of elevated [[esker]], indicating the channel ran through ice for a distance. The below-grade sections typically run {{convert|5|-|30|km|mi|abbr=on}} in length; in some cases the sections form a larger pattern of an interrupted channel composed of strings of depressions which can extend from {{convert|70|-|100|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=J/&gt;

===Structure===
The upstream portion – that section furthest into the glacier – consists of a branching system forming a network, similar to the [[Anastomosis|anastomostic]] branching patterns of the upper reaches of a river (as contrasted with [[wikt:dendritic|dendritic]] patterns). They typically exhibit the largest cross-sectional area in the center of the course and terminate over a relatively short distance in elevated outwash fans at the ice-margin.&lt;ref name=J/&gt;

Tunnel valleys are found to cross the regional gradient – as a result they may be crosscut by modern stream networks. In one example, tributaries of the Kalamazoo River cut at nearly right angles across buried tunnel channel filled with ice and debris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The water flow was from upper right to lower left. Close examination shows the existence of buried tunnel valleys as well – they can be identified by contrasting vegetation.]]

Tunnel valley channels often start or stop abruptly.  They have convex-up longitudinal profiles. They are often occupied by elongated lakes of [[underfit]] streams.  They frequently show signs of subsequent depositions such as eskers.&lt;ref name=Fisher2005/&gt;

===Evidence of erosion mechanisms===
Evidence suggests that erosion in a tunnel valley is primarily the result of water flow. They erode by meltwater, which it has been argued, episodically drains in repeated [[jökulhlaup]]s from subglacially stored lakes and reservoirs; examples of such motion have been observed in [[Antarctica]]. Although there is evidence of ice erosion such as linear striations in the bedrock, these are observed only in the widest valleys, and are believed to have played a secondary role.&lt;ref name=J/&gt;

The subglacial layout of  valley tunnels/channels is predominantly oriented parallel to glacial ice flow lines – essentially they stretch from areas of thicker sheet ice toward areas of thinner sheet ice. They can exhibit reverse gradients, which result when pressurized meltwater flows over obstacles such as ridges or hills along the glacier bed.&lt;ref name=Shaw2008/&gt;

Tunnel valleys can be formed under extremely thick glacial ice – examples have been observed on the bottom of [[Lake Superior]] and in the oceans offshore in Antarctica. The course of a tunnel valley typically runs from thickest glacial ice to the glacier margin; as a result the glacial ice pressurizes the water such that it runs uphill toward its end.&lt;ref name=J/&gt;

==Formation of tunnel valleys/channels==
Although there is agreement on the role of meltwater in creation of tunnel valleys, several theories are still under consideration for the role of that meltwater:
:*Steady state theory – Boulton and Hindmarsh propose a steady state theory. They suggest tunnel valleys form in unconsolidated sediment when meltwater flows under pressure through an initially narrow subglacial conduit. With progressive removal of sediment by meltwater, ice deforms under its own weight into the cavity to create a tunnel valley through a positive feedback mechanism.&lt;ref name=Boulton1987&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Boulton  | first = G.A.|author2=R.C.A. Hindmarsh  | title = Sediment deformation beneath glaciers; rheology and geological consequences | journal = Journal of Geophysical Research | volume = 92 | issue = B2 | pages = 9059–9082 | publisher = American Geophysical Union| location = | date = 27 January 1987 | url = | issn = | doi =  10.1029/JB092iB09p09059| id = | bibcode=1987JGR....92.9059B}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:*Jökulhlaup driven erosion – Piotrowski argues that ice sheets may, in some instances, be cold-based; that is they contact land that is frozen (permafrost) and they freeze to the permafrost. Meltwater builds up behind this frozen ice terminus until it generates sufficient pressure to lift the ice and break the bond, with a catastrophic meltwater release such as is seen with the [[Iceland]]ic [[jökulhlaup]]. As a consequence of this jökulhlaup a tunnel valley is formed.&lt;ref name=Piotrowski2009/&gt;
:*Upglacier erosion – Wingfield proposes that tunnel valleys form gradually, with the valley head cutting progressively back toward the source up-glacier during deglaciation.&lt;ref&gt;Wingfield R.; The origin of major incisions within the Pleistocene deposits of the North Sea
(1990) Marine Geology, 91 (1–2), pp.&amp;nbsp;31–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Periodic outbursts of subglacial water have been observed moving subglacial water between subglacial lakes beneath the East Antarctic Ice Sheet.  Satellite data recorded a subglacial discharge totaling {{convert|2|km3|mi3|abbr=on}}  traveling ~{{convert|260|km|mi|abbr=on}} over a period of less than a year. As the flow subsided, the weight of ice closed the tunnel and sealed the lake again.&lt;ref name=Wingham2006&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Wingham  | first = Duncan J.  | authorlink =   | author2 = Martin J. Siegert, Andrew Shepherd and Alan S. Muir  | title = Rapid discharge connects Antarctic subglacial lakes  | journal = Nature  | volume = 440  | issue =   7087| pages = 1033–1036  | publisher =   | location =   | date = 20 April 2006  | url =   | issn =     | pmid = 16625193| doi = 10.1038/nature04660  | id =   |bibcode = 2006Natur.440.1033W | last3 = Shepherd  | first3 = Andrew  | last4 = Muir  | first4 = Alan S.  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The water flow was modeled satisfactorily with channeling in ice and in sediment. The analytic model shows that over some regions, the ice-bedrock geometry included sections which would have frozen, blocking off flow, unless erosion of the sedimentary substrate was the means of creating a channel and sustaining the discharge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Carter  | first = Sasha P.  | authorlink =   | author2 = Donald D.

===Common features of tunnel valley theories===
[[File:Lagowski Park Krajobrazowy-World Wind.jpg|thumb|280px|right|A Polish [[ribbon lake]] formed in a tunnel valley. Note the variable width and the interruption between segments of the course. There is also evidence of other sediment-filled channels adjacent to this (e.g., two smaller lakes to the right)]]
Subglacial meltwater flow is common to all theories; hence a key to understanding channel formation is an understanding of subglacial meltwater flow. Meltwater may be produced on the glacier surface (supraglacially), below the glacier (basally) or both. Meltwater may flow either supraglacially or basally as well; the signatures of supraglacial and basal water flow differ with the passage zone. Supraglacial flow is similar to stream flow in all surface environments – water flows from higher areas to lower areas under the influence of gravity. Basal flow exhibits significant differences. In basal flow the water, either produced by melting at the base or drawn downward from the surface by gravity, collects at the base of the glacier in ponds and lakes in a pocket overlain by hundreds of meters of ice. If there is no surface drainage path, water from surface melting will flow downward and collect in crevices in the ice, while water from basal melting will collect under the glacier; either source will form a subglacial lake. The [[hydraulic head]] of the water collected in a basal lake will increase as water drains through the ice until the pressure grows high enough to either develop a path through the ice or to float the ice above it.&lt;ref name=Smellie2008A/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shaw2008/&gt;

===Steady state theory===
Sources of water and water drainage routes through and below temperate and sub-polar glaciers are reasonably well understood and provide a basis for understanding tunnel valleys. For these glaciers, supraglacial water ponds or moves in rivers across the surface of the glacier until it drops down a vertical crevice (a [[Moulin (geology)|moulin]]) in the glacier. There it joins subglacial water created by geothermal heat; some portion of the water drains into aquifers below the glacier. Excess subglacial water that cannot drain through sediment or impermeable bedrock as groundwater, moves either through channels eroded into the bed of sediment below the glacier (called Nye channels&lt;ref&gt;The smaller channels, known as ''Nye channels,'' are named after British physicist [[John Nye (scientist)|John Nye]].&lt;/ref&gt;) or through channels upward into the glacial ice (called Rothlisberger channels), eventually flowing out at the ice margin.  On the simplest level, the tunnel valley can be considered a larger-scale version of these phenomena.&lt;ref name=Eyles2006&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Eyles | first = Nick K | title = The role of meltwater in glacial processes | journal = [[Sedimentary Geology (journal)|Sedimentary Geology]] | volume = 190 | issue = 1–4 | pages = 257–268 | publisher = | location = | date = 1 August 2006 | url = | issn = | doi = 10.1016/j.sedgeo.2006.05.018 | id = |bibcode = 2006SedG..190..257E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tunnel valleys or tunnel channels are produced by meltwater flows beneath glacial ice. Tunnel valleys are often buried or partially buried by sediment accumulation during periods of ice advance and retreat.&lt;ref name=Shaw2008&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Shaw | first = J | authorlink = | author2 = A.

R. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although attractive since it scales up the Nye channel formation which has been observed in sediments, a weakness of the steady state theory is that it requires that tunnel valleys be excavated in unconsolidated sediment, in which meltwater is initially forced through an initially narrow subglacial conduit. With progressive sediment erosion by the meltwater, ice deforms under its own weight into the cavity to creating an ever-larger tunnel valley. However the steady state theory appears not to account for erosion into bedrock, which has been extensively observed.&lt;ref name=LeHeron2009A/&gt;

===Jökulhlaup driven erosion===
There is evidence that meltwater discharges are episodic.&lt;ref name=Wingham2006/&gt; This can result because as water continues to collect, more ice is lifted, and the water moves outward in a growing under-ice lake. Areas where the ice is most easily lifted (i.e., areas with thinner overlying ice sheets) are lifted first. Hence the water may move up the terrain underlying the glacier if it moves toward areas of lower overlying ice.&lt;ref&gt;A [[waterbed]] analogy can be applied here – the water moves under the pressure of the overlying ice, just as it does when a mass is placed on a water bed.&lt;/ref&gt; As water collects, additional ice is lifted until a release path is created.

If no preexisting channel is present, the water is initially released in a broad-front [[jökulhlaup]] which can have a flow front that is tens of kilometers wide, spreading out in a thin front. As the flow continues, it tends to erode the underlying materials and the overlying ice, creating a channel even as the reduced pressure allows most of the glacial ice to settle back to the underlying surface, sealing off the broad front release and channelizing the flow. The direction of the channel is defined primarily by the overlying ice thickness and secondarily by the gradient of the underlying earth, and may be observed to “run uphill” as the pressure of the ice forces the water to areas of lower ice coverage until it emerges at a glacial face. Hence the configuration of the various tunnel valleys formed by a specific glaciation provide a general mapping of the glacier thickness when the tunnel valleys were formed, particularly if the original surface relief under the glacier was limited.&lt;ref name=Smellie2008A/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shaw2008/&gt;

Analyses by Piotrowski demonstrate that the annual production of water from one typical catchment of {{convert|642000000|m3|cuft|abbr=out}} would normally drain through its associated tunnel valley in less than 48 hours.&lt;ref name=Piotrowski2009&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Piotrowski  | first = Jan A.   | authorlink =   | title = Subglacial hydrology in north-western Germany during the last glaciation: groundwater flow, tunnel valleys and hydrological cycles  | journal = Quaternary Science Reviews  | volume = 16  | issue = 2  | pages = 169–185  | publisher =   | location =   | year = 1997  | url =   | issn =   | doi = 10.1016/S0277-3791(96)00046-7  | id =   |bibcode = 1997QSRv...16..169P }}&lt;/ref&gt; The debris found in tunnels and at the mouth of tunnels tends to be coarse rocks and boulders – this is indicative of high flow velocities and an extremely erosive environment. This erosive environment is consistent with creation of tunnels over {{convert|400|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep and {{convert|2.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide, as have been observed in the Antarctic.&lt;ref name=Shaw2008/&gt; Piotrowski’s model predicts a cycle as follows: 
# Meltwater is produced as a result of geothermal heating from below. Surface ablation water is not considered as it would be minimal at the glacial maximum and evidence indicates that surface water does not penetrate more than {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} into a glacier.&lt;ref name=Piotrowski2009/&gt;
# Meltwater initially drains through subglacial aquifers.&lt;ref name=Piotrowski2009/&gt;
# When the hydraulic transmissivity of the substratum is exceeded, subglacial meltwater accumulates in basins.&lt;ref name=Piotrowski2009/&gt;
# Water accumulates sufficiently to open the ice blockage in the tunnel valley which accumulated after the last discharge.&lt;ref name=Piotrowski2009/&gt;
# The tunnel valley discharges the meltwater excess – turbulent flow melts out or erodes the excess ice as well as eroding the valley floor.&lt;ref name=Piotrowski2009/&gt;
# As the water level drops, the pressure decreases until the tunnel valleys again close with ice and water flow ceases.&lt;ref name=Piotrowski2009/&gt;

===Post-erosion infill processes===
Tunnel valleys have similar characteristics, irrespective of whether they are formed on land or in a submerged environment. This is because they are formed by high pressure water under a thick ice sheet – in a submerged environment they still have sufficient pressure to erode tunnel valleys into configurations comparable to those generated on land.&lt;ref name=LeHeron2009A&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Le Heron | first = Daniel Paul | author2 = Jonathan Craig and James L. Etienne | title = Ancient glaciations and hydrocarbon accumulations in North Africa and the Middle East | journal = Earth-Science Reviews | volume = 93 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 47–76 | publisher = © 2009 Elsevier B.V. | location = | date = April 2009 | doi =10.1016/j.earscirev.2009.02.001   | id = |bibcode = 2009ESRv...93...47L | last3 = Etienne | first3 = James L. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tunnel valleys may remain open, partially filled or filled, as a function of the glacial recession. The filled configuration is significant because filled tunnel valleys become excellent reservoirs for either water (aquifer) or for oil. This results since relatively coarse-grained sandstones are located on the valley floors and valley margins and valley floor because the coarser-grained sediments settle out more easily and accumulate preferentially in the flowing water common to the tunnel valley fill stages.&lt;ref name=LeHeron2009A/&gt;

The subglacial tunnel valley networks originally formed near the ice margin. Tunnel valleys are likely to fill with sediment as the result of meltwater release during glacial recession. Tunnel valleys fill in two main ways. In the first instance, debris carried by flow settles out and accumulates in the tunnel valley. Subsequently, once the ice has retreated sufficiently, marine deposits may be laid down, depending on the water depth at the ice front.&lt;ref name=LeHeron2009A/&gt;

The tunnel valley sedimentary record is controlled by meltwater release flowrates and sediment burdens during glacial recession. The sediment found in the tunnel valley provides insight into whether it was laid down in a tidal environment, a transitional environment, or an essentially dry environment with good drainage. In the glaciomarine environment, glacially-related deposits are interbedded with to those similar to those on non-glaciated tidal areas; the tidal environment will show undertow dominated fans. The transitional environment is characterized by both mixed marine and fresh water life in a delta environment. In an essentially dry environment, the glacial flow carries sediment which accumulates much as it would in any stream bed.&lt;ref name=LeHeron2009A/&gt;

===Large-scale structure===
[[Ice sheet dynamics|Ice flow within glaciers]] results from an increase in the surface slope of the glacier, which result from geographic features combined with an imbalance between the amounts of ice accumulated through precipitation and lost through [[ablation]]. The increased gradient increases the [[shear stress]] on a glacier until it begins to flow. The flow velocity and deformation are also affected by the slope of the ice, the ice thickness and temperature.

Punkari identified that [[ice sheets|continental ice sheets]] typically flow in fan-shaped lobes, which converge from separate sources and move at differing speeds. Lobes are separated by [[interlobular|interlobate]] zones, which have thinner ice coverage. Water collects in this interlobate area. The hydraulic head (pressure) is lower in areas of thinner ice; hence subglacial water tends to converge on the interlobate joint. The separate lobes move at different speeds, generating friction at the ice boundary; the heat released melts ice to release additional water. The surface of the interlobate area is crevassed, allowing surface meltwater, which runs down the ice surface to the lower area, to penetrate into the ice. As a result, the ice-flow patterns and the debris accumulation are different in interlobate zones. Specifically, tunnel valleys and [[esker]]s indicate water flow toward the interlobate zones, which are elevated as the result of debris carried and deposited there.&lt;ref name=Punkari1997&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Punkari   | first = Mikko   | authorlink =   | title = Glacial and Glaciofluvial Deposits in the Interlobate Areas of the Scandinavian Ice Sheet   | journal = Quaternary Science Reviews   | volume = 16   | issue =   7| pages = 741–753  | publisher = Elsevier Science Ltd.    | location =   | year = 1997  | url =   | issn =   | doi =   10.1016/S0277-3791(97)00020-6| id =   |bibcode = 1997QSRv...16..741P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2952">A '''WOEID''' (Where On Earth IDentifier) is a unique 32-bit reference identifier, originally defined by [[GeoPlanet]] and now assigned by [[Yahoo!]], that identifies any feature on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Yahoo!

WOEIDs are used by a number of other projects, including [[Flickr]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.places.getInfo.html|title=Flickr Services: Flickr API: flickr.places.getInfo|website=www.flickr.com|access-date=2016-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[OpenStreetMap]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:woeid|title=Key:woeid - OpenStreetMap Wiki|website=wiki.openstreetmap.org|access-date=2016-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Twitter]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/trends/available|title=Twitter Developer Documentation|website=dev.twitter.com|access-date=2017-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Example ==

E.g. Berlin does not know about Germany, which itself doesn't know about Europe and so forth. GeoPlanet records, or places as they are called by Yahoo!, always (except one) have a reference to its parent place and therefore offer relations between places like the following:&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cosmocode.de/en/blog/schoenborn/2010-01/24-free-geo-data-solutions-compared-geonames.org-vs.-yahoo-geoplanet?&lt;/ref&gt;
* Parent (direct surrounding place)
* Child (direct sub-places)
* Siblings (places sharing the same parent and place type)
* Ancestors (set of all parents)

If you take e.g. our company's district you will get the following family tree:

* Deutschland (WOEID 23424829)
** Bundesland Berlin (WOEID 2345496)
*** Stadtkreis Berlin (WOEID 1259838)
**** Berlin (WOEID 638242)
***** Ortsteil Pankow (WOEID 26821868)
***** Ortsteil Prenzlauer Berg (WOEID 26821872)
***** Ortsteil Wedding (WOEID 26821851)
***** ...
