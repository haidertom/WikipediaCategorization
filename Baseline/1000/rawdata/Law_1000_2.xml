      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11921">{{Indigenous rights}}
'''Ancestral domain''' or '''ancestral lands''' refers to the [[Lands inhabited by indigenous peoples|lands, territories and resources of indigenous peoples]], particularly in the [[Asia-Pacific]] region. The term differs from [[indigenous land rights]], [[Aboriginal title]] or [[Native title in Australia|Native Title]] by directly indicating relationship to land based on [[ancestry]], while [[wiktionary:Domain|domain]] indicates relationships beyond material lands and territories, including [[Spirituality|spiritual]] and [[cultural]] aspects that may not be acknowledged in [[land titles]] and [[legal doctrine]] about [[trade|trading]] [[ownership]].

== Concept ==

Indigenous peoples may prefer to be described as custodians or guardians of their ancestral domain or lands rather than as title owners or [[land owner]]s.

The concept of [[individual]] [[Property rights (economics)|property ownership]] and [[land tenure]] that can be traded was often introduced as part of [[colonialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=State of the World's Indigenous Peoples Chapter 2 Culture |url=https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/SOWIP_chapter2.pdf|publisher=United Nations |accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=University of Melbourne Aboriginal Cultural Protocols Guidelines|url=http://www.murrupbarak.unimelb.edu.au/files/miip/Cultural_Protocols_University_Council%20(Final).pdf|publisher=University of Melbourne|accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Background Briefing Guardians|url=http://www.survivalinternational.org/about/guardians|publisher=Survival International |accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Western model of land ownership gives an individual the property right to control land as a [[commodity]], indigenous conceptions have a cultural and spiritual character. They invoke a mutual responsibility and relationship between land and people.&lt;ref name="journal"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Indigenous Rights in International Politics: The Case of "Overcompliant" Liberal States. | year = 2008 |last= Lightfoot |first= Sheryl |doi= 10.1177/030437540803300105|journal=Alternatives: Global, Local, Political |volume=33|issue=1|pages=83–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor [[Mick Dodson|Michael Dodson]] [[Order of Australia|AM]] described [[Aboriginal Australians]]' idea of country using the term during his [[Australian of the Year]] speech. He said:
{{Quote|For us, country is a word for all the values, places, resources, stories and cultural obligations associated with the area and its features. It in fact describes the entirety of our ancestral domains. So when we acknowledge traditional country, as increasingly people do so in Australia, it's no empty [[ritual]]: it's to acknowledge who we, the Aboriginal people, are and our place in this nation. In doing that, it seems to me, all Australians might have a clearer notion of who they are and where they stand in relation to their history and the land they live in.&lt;ref name="museumvid"&gt;{{cite video |title=Australian of the Year speech, Professor Michael Dodson AM|url=http://museumvictoria.com.au/immigrationmuseum/discoverycentre/identity/videos/politics-videos/australian-of-the-year-speech-professor-michael-dodson/|publisher=Museum Victoria |accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="country protocol"&gt;{{cite web |title=Protocol for Welcome to and Acknowledgement of Country|url=https://www.lawsociety.com.au/cs/groups/public/documents/internetcontent/680910.pdf|publisher=Law Society of New South Wales |accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== History ==

The term was used as early as the 1920s in the work of the [[International Labour Organization]].&lt;ref name="ILO"&gt;{{cite web |title=History of ILO's work|url=http://www.ilo.org/indigenous/Aboutus/HistoryofILOswork/lang--en/index.htm|publisher=International Labour Organization |accessdate=11 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the ILO was concerned with the situation of indigenous and tribal peoples in their roles as workers in the overseas colonies of European powers. It became increasingly evident that indigenous peoples were exposed to severe labour exploitation and had a need for special protection in cases where they were expelled from their ancestral domains only to become seasonal, migrant, bonded or home-based [[labourers]]. This recognition led to adoption in 1930 of the ILO's [[Forced Labour Convention]] (No. 29).&lt;ref name=ILO/&gt;

Following the creation of the [[United Nations]], the ILO with the participation of other parts of the UN system created the [[Indigenous and Tribal Populations Convention]] (No. 107). Convention No. 107 was adopted in 1957 as the first international treaty on this subject.&lt;ref name=ILO/&gt;

This involved the underlying assumption that the only possible future for indigenous and tribal peoples was integration into larger society, and that the state should make decisions regarding indigenous development. In 1986 an ILO committee of experts concluded that "the integrationist approach of the Convention was obsolete and that its application was detrimental in the modern world." &lt;ref name=ILO/&gt;

In 1988 and 1989, the revision of Convention No. 107 was on the agenda of the International Labour Conference (ILC) and in June 1989, the Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention (No. 169) was adopted.&lt;ref name=ILO/&gt;

This paved the way for the [[United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]] in 2007.

== Documentation ==

Indigenous peoples in Asia have used [[counter-mapping|community mapping]] to advocate for [[land rights]]. This mapping may include documenting [[sacred sites]] and [[wikt:immaterial|immaterial]] but geographically-linked [[traditional knowledge]] of land.&lt;ref name="map1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Talubo|first= Joan |last2= Pauline |title=Community Mapping in the Philippines: A Case Study on the Ancestral Domain Claim of the Higaonons in Impasug-ong, Bukidnon |url=https://www.academia.edu/1136474/Community_Mapping_in_the_Philippines_A_Case_Study_on_the_Ancestral_Domain_Claim_of_the_Higaonons_in_Impasug-ong_Bukidnon|publisher=Regional Community Mapping Network Workshop |accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="map2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Tuminez|first= Astrid |title=This Land is Our Land: Moro Ancestral Domain and Its Implications for Peace and Development in the Southern Philippines|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/sais/summary/v027/27.2tuminez.html |publisher=SAIS Review of International Affairs |accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="map3"&gt;{{cite web|last= Widodo |first= Kasmita |title=Indonesia's 'One Map Policy' Down to Earth|url=http://andikhardiyanto.wordpress.com/2013/02/11/indonesias-one-map-policy-down-to-earth/ |publisher=MERDESA Institute for Rural Reconstruction |accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regional contexts ==

=== Indonesia ===

In 2013, the Indonesian [[Constitutional Court]] amended the 1999 Law on Forestry to return land rights to indigenous peoples whose ancestral lands are forested.&lt;ref name="court"&gt;{{cite web|last= Pasandaran |first= Camelia |title=Constitutional Court Annuls Government Ownership of Customary Forests|url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/news/constitutional-court-annuls-government-ownership-of-customary-forests/ |publisher=Jakarta Globe |accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="redd"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lang|first= Chris |title=Indigenous peoples' rights and the status of forest land in Indonesia|url=http://www.redd-monitor.org/2013/10/09/indigenous-peoples-rights-and-the-status-of-forest-land-in-indonesia/ |accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Indonesia, there have been many land conflicts regarding indigenous community territories in resource-rich [[Kalimantan]]. According to data quoted in the [[Jakarta Post]], following the enactment of the Masterplan for the Acceleration and Expansion of Indonesian Economic Development (MP3EI) in 2011, some 135 communities became involved in conflict with businesses.&lt;ref name="Indonews"&gt;{{cite web|last= Sabarini |first= Prodita |title=NGO maps out indigenous community territories|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/06/24/ngo-maps-out-indigenous-community-territories.html |publisher=Jakarta Post |accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many conflicts involve indigenous peoples' traditional cultures being uprooted by [[palm oil]] plantations, or [[logging]] or [[mining]] interests.

[[NGOs]] in Indonesia set up the Ancestral Domain Registration Agency. A community mapper said the agency was created to "be prepared for the court ruling. If it the Constitutional Court ruled that customary forests belonged to indigenous peoples, we wanted to be able to show where those customary forests were located." &lt;ref name=Indonews/&gt;

=== Canada ===
{{see|List of traditional territories of the indigenous peoples of North America|registered traplines}}
The common term in Canada is "traditional territory".  This can refer the entire [[homeland]] of a large ethnic group or the particular hunting and trapping grounds of a small [[band society]].  In areas where treaties have been signed, it refers to the land outside of [[Indian reserves]] in which a particular indigenous nation still claims an interest.  In the case of specific rights to hunt and fish in a territory, these are called "[[aboriginal rights]]" and are a separate legal category from "[[treaty rights]]".  In the case of areas where there are no treaties, such as most of [[British Columbia]], the Supreme Court of Canada has ruled that [[aboriginal title]] applies to the entirety of a nation's claimed homeland, and not just to the particular locations of villages and other intensely-used sites.  This was a unanimous ruling by the court in the 2017 case ''[[Tsilhqot'in Nation v British Columbia]]''.  However, in that same year, the Canadian court rejected the spiritual use of a site as being sufficient to establish aboriginal title, in ''[[Ktunaxa Nation v British Columbia (Forests, Lands and Natural Resource Operations)]]''.

=== Philippines ===

In the [[Philippines]], the term is used to refer to indigenous peoples' [[land rights]] in law.&lt;ref name="UP"&gt;{{cite web|last=Romualdo|first= Arlyn |last2= Palisoc |first2= VCD |title=Protecting IPs' Rights to Ancestral Domains and Lands|url=http://www.up.edu.ph/protecting-ips-rights-to-ancestral-domains-and-lands/|publisher=University of the Philippines |accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancestral lands are referred to in the [[Constitution of the Philippines|Philippines Constitution]]. Article XII, Section 5 says: "The State, subject to the provisions of this Constitution and national development policies and programs, shall protect the rights of indigenous cultural communities to their ancestral lands to ensure their economic, social, and cultural well-being." &lt;ref name="Inq"&gt;{{cite web|last= Bernas |first= Joaquin  |title=Ancestral domain vs regalian doctrine (2) |url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/inquireropinion/columns/view/20080929-163630/Ancestral-domain-vs-regalian-doctrine-2/|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer |accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Food and Agriculture Organization]]'s research on forest land ownership in the Philippines found conflicts in institutional mandates among the [[Local Government Code]], [[mining law]] and the [[National Integrated Protected Areas Act]], and recommended exclusive resource use rights to community-based forest management communities.&lt;ref name="law1"&gt;{{cite web
 |title=Trends in forest ownership, forest resources tenure and institutional arrangements: are they contributing to better forest management and poverty reduction?|url= http://www.fao.org/forestry/10543-03d5a1b99b199bb5b040e70eba8414526.pdf |publisher=FAO |accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4174">The '''Ashwander rules''', articulated by [[Louis Brandeis|Justice Louis D. Brandeis]], are a set of principles used by the [[United States]] [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] for avoiding constitutional rulings.

== Rules for Judicial Self-Restraint and Avoiding Constitutional Questions ==
Justice [[Louis Brandeis|Louis D. Brandeis]], concurring in ''[[Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority]]'', 297 U.S. 288 (1936), summarized some prudential rules for exercising judicial self-restraint and avoiding ruling on the constitutionality of congressional legislation:

[[Supreme Court of the United States|The Court]] developed, for its own governance in the cases confessedly within its [[jurisdiction]], a series of rules under which it has avoided passing upon a large part of all the constitutional questions pressed upon it for decision. They are:

# The Court will not pass upon the constitutionality of legislation in a friendly, non-adversary, proceeding, declining because to decide such questions "is legitimate only in the last resort, earnest and vital controversy between individuals. It never was the thought that, by means of a friendly suit, a party beaten in the legislature could transfer to the courts an inquiry as to the constitutionality of the  [[Act of Congress|legislative act]]."&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago &amp; Grand Trunk Ry. v. Wellman'', 143 U.S. 339 (1892)&lt;/ref&gt;
# The Court will not "anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding it." &lt;ref name="Liverpool, N.Y. 1885"&gt;''Liverpool, N.Y. &amp; P.S.S. Co. v. Emigration Commissioners'', 113 U.S. 33 (1885)&lt;/ref&gt; "It is not the habit of the Court to decide questions of a constitutional nature unless absolutely necessary to a decision of the case." &lt;ref&gt;''Burton v. United States'', 196 U.S. 283 (1905)&lt;/ref&gt;
# The Court will not "formulate a rule of  [[United States constitutional law|constitutional law]] broader than is required by the Precise facts to which it is to be applied." &lt;ref name="Liverpool, N.Y. 1885" /&gt;
# The Court will not pass upon a constitutional question although properly presented by the record, if there is also present some other ground upon which the case may be disposed of. This rule has found most varied application. Thus, if a case can be decided on either of two grounds, one involving a constitutional question, the other a question of [[statutory construction]] or general law, the Court will decide only the latter. Appeals from the highest court of a state challenging its decision of a question under the [[United States Constitution|Federal Constitution]] are frequently dismissed because the judgment can be sustained on an independent state ground.
# The Court will not pass upon the validity of a statute upon complaint of one who fails to show that he is injured by its operation. Among the many applications of this rule, none is more striking than the denial of the right to challenge to one who lacks a personal or property right. (While not mentioned in ''Ashwander'', there are exceptions in the case of a [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] challenge where the party may raise the effect of a law on other person's First Amendment rights, the so called "[[chilling effect]]" doctrine.)
# The Court will not pass upon the constitutionality of a statute at the instance of one who has availed himself of its benefits.
# "When the validity of an act of the Congress is drawn in question, and even if a serious doubt of constitutionality is raised, it is a cardinal principle that this Court will first ascertain whether a construction of the statute is fairly possible by which the question may be avoided." &lt;ref&gt;''Crowell v. Benson'', 285 U.S. 22 (1932)&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''boilerplate clause''' is a [[legal English]] term that is used in conjunction with [[contract law]]. When forming contracts, parties to the contract often use templates or forms with boilerplate clauses ([[boilerplate text|boilerplate language]], used as standard language). Such clauses refers to the standardised clauses in contracts, and they are to be found towards the end of the agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Leszek Berezowski, Jak czytać i rozumieć angielskie umowy? Warsaw 2014, page 276.&lt;/ref&gt; Including boilerplate clauses is the process by which parties to the contract may better define their relationship and the will to provide certainty if terms in the contract are ever disputed. Boilerplate clauses are standard contractual terms that are routinely included in many contracts.&lt;ref&gt;International Commercial Agreements: An Edinburgh Law Guide: An Edinburgh Law Guide, Michala Meiselles
Edinburgh University Press - page 336&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most common clause types are listed below:

==Assignment clause== 
An assignment clause is based on prohibiting or permitting a complete transfer or rights under the contract to another party.

'''An example:'''
 Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under the Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise by either party without the prior written consent of the other party.

The transfer may be prohibited or permitted entirely or in part. The example of permitting assignment under specified circumstances is:

'''An example:'''
The hulls and freight clauses contain a similar "assignment clause" which states that no assignment is binding unless a dated notice of assignment, signed by the assured is endorsed on the policy and the policy is produced before payment of claim or return of premium.&lt;ref&gt;Insurance Law in the United Kingdom,John Birds,Kluwer Law International, 2010 - p. 246&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Assignment (law)}}

==''Force majeure'' clause== 
A ''[[force majeure]]'' clause is designed to protect against failures to perform contractual obligations caused by unavoidable events beyond a party’s control, such as natural disasters. ''Force majeure'' clauses are primarily used to identify circumstances in which performance of contract may be forgiven&lt;ref&gt;International Commercial Agreements: A Primer on Drafting, Negotiating, and Resolving Disputes, William F. Fox

 This Agreement will be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. If for any reason any term or provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable to any extent, then (a) such term or provision will be interpreted, construed, or reformed to the extent reasonably required to render the same valid, enforceable, and consistent with the original intent underlying such provision; (b) such term or provision will remain in effect to the extent that it is not invalid or unenforceable; and (c) such invalidity or unenforceability will not affect any other term or provision of this Agreement.”

[[File:Mustafa bairakdar.jpg|thumb|Alemdar Mustafa Pasha]]
The '''Charter of  Alliance''' ({{lang-tr|Sened-i İttifak}}), also known as  '''Deed of Agreement''' was a treaty between the [[grand vizier]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and a number of powerful local rulers signed in 1808, in an attempt to regulate their power and relations with the central Ottoman government.

== Background ==
In the Ottoman Empire, agricultural land was considered to be the sultan's private estate. These estates ({{lang-tr|dirlik}}) were granted  to cavalrymen ({{lang-tr|tımarlı sipahi}}, "[[timariot]] [[sipahi]]s") in return for their military services during war. The system was similar to the [[fief]] system of [[Medieval Europe]], except that the land was non-inheritable, precluding the rise of [[feudalism]] in the Ottoman Empire. However during the [[Decline of the Ottoman Empire|Empire's decline]] in the 18th century, two factors provoked a kind of feudalism:
*The advance in military technology, which rendered the Ottoman cavalry far less effective.
*Loss of profitable land and almost continuous wars forced the [[Ottoman Porte]] to collect more tax and to appoint tax collectors to provinces.

The cavalrymen were replaced by the tax collectors and local military rulers who were called [[derebey]]s ("river lords") or '''ayan'''. These powerful local leaders formed de facto local dynasties supported by considerable military power. By the end of the 18th century, the authority of the sultan had become almost non-existent outside the capital [[Istanbul]], and the empire had become highly decentralized.

== Alemdar Mustafa's rise to Grand Vizier ==

[[Alemdar Mustafa Pasha]] an ayan in [[Rusçuk]] (Ruse, [[Bulgaria]]) was supporting the reformist Sultan [[Selim III]] (reigned 1789–1807). After Selim III was dethroned, Alemdar marched to Istanbul to reenthrone Selim III. However Selim had been killed by the new Sultan [[Mustafa IV]]. Alemdar dethroned Mustafa IV and enthroned his brother [[Mahmut II]] (reigned 1808–1839). To show gratitude, Mahmut II appointed Alemdar as his grand vizier.

== The Charter of Alliance ==
Originally one of the ayans himself, Alemdar tried to end the chaos in the empire by a treaty. He invited other ayans to [[Istanbul]]. Although only four of them showed up, Alemdar and they signed a document called the "Charter of Alliance" ({{lang-tr|Sened’i İttifak}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anayasa.gen.tr/senediittifak.htm Constitution page {{tr icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; on 29 September 1808. The terms were
# The ayans promised to show respect to the Sultan.
# The ayans agreed to assign their military units in the Sultan's army.
# The ayans promised to help to protect the Sultan’s treasury.
# The ayans promised to obey the orders given by the Grand Vizier under the condition that the orders were not illegal. The ayans also agreed not to interfere in other ayans' sphere of influence.
# The Porte legitimised the ayans and their estates. Furthermore, the estates were declared inheritable.
# The ayans promised to support the Sultan against revolts.
# The Grand Vizier promised to consult with the ayans to solve taxation problems, while ayans promised not to oppress the poor.

== Aftermath ==
According to some historians,&lt;ref name="Aksin"&gt;Sina Akşin: ''Türkiye Tarihi'', Cem yayınevi,İstanbul, 2009, vol 3 {{ISBN|975-406-565-9}}, p 95&lt;/ref&gt; the Charter of  Alliance was a form of Turkish [[Magna Carta]]. Others, however;&lt;ref name="Aksin"/&gt; point out that the Charter, signed in the first half of the 19th century, can't be compared to the Magna Carta of the 13th century.

In any case, the Charter was short-lived. According to the treaty, Alemdar's successors would also sign the treaty. But after Alemdar's death no Grand Vizier ratified the treaty, probably due to the sultan's only half-hearted support to it.&lt;ref&gt;Lord Kinross: ''The Ottoman centuries'' (trans:Meral Gaspıralı) Altın Kitaplar,İstanbul, 2008,{{ISBN|978-975-21-0955-1}}, p 438&lt;/ref&gt; The Sultan saw this treaty as a challenge to his prestige.&lt;ref&gt;Prof. Yaşar Yüce-Prof. Ali Sevim: ''Türkiye tarihi Cilt IV'', AKDTYKTTK Yayınları, İstanbul, 1991 p 173&lt;/ref&gt; In the following years however the energetic Sultan fought against the ayans and was able subdue most of them.

{{Rights |Human}}

'''Civil and political rights''' are a class of [[rights]] that protect [[individual]]s' [[political freedom|freedom]] from infringement by [[government]]s, [[social organization]]s, and private individuals. They ensure one's ability to participate in the civil and political life of the society and [[State (polity)|state]] without [[discrimination]] or [[Political repression|repression]].

Civil rights include the ensuring of peoples' physical and mental [[integrity]], [[right to life|life]], and [[safety]]; protection from discrimination on grounds such as [[Race (human classification)|race]], [[gender]], [[sexual orientation]], [[gender identity]], [[national origin]], [[human skin color|color]], [[ageing|age]], [[Political party|political affiliation]], [[ethnicity]], [[religion]], and [[disability]];&lt;ref&gt;The Civil Rights act of 1964, [http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=true&amp;doc=97 ourdocuments.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, [http://www.access-board.gov/about/laws/ada.htm accessboard.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Summary of LGBT civil rights protections, by state, at Lambda Legal, [http://www.lambdalegal.org/states-regions/ lambdalegal.org]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[individual rights]] such as [[privacy]] and the freedoms of [[freedom of thought|thought]], [[freedom of speech|speech]], [[freedom of religion|religion]], [[freedom of the press|press]], [[freedom of assembly|assembly]], and [[freedom of movement|movement]].

Political rights include [[natural justice]] (procedural fairness) in [[law]], such as the [[rights of the accused]], including the [[right to a fair trial]]; [[due process]]; the right to seek redress or a [[legal remedy]]; and rights of [[Participation (decision making)|participation]] in [[civil society]] and [[politics]] such as [[freedom of association]], the [[right to assemble]], the [[right to petition]], the [[right of self-defense]], and the [[Suffrage|right to vote]].

Civil and political rights form the original and main part of international [[human rights]].&lt;ref&gt;A useful survey is Paul Sieghart, ''The Lawful Rights of Mankind: An Introduction to the International Legal Code of Human Rights'', Oxford University Press, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; They comprise the first portion of the 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (with [[economic, social, and cultural rights]] comprising the second portion). The theory of [[three generations  of human rights]] considers this group of rights to be "first-generation rights", and the theory of [[negative and positive rights]] considers them to be generally [[negative rights]].

==History==
The phrase "Rights for Civil" is a translation of Latin ''ius civis'' (rights of a citizen). Roman citizens could be either free (''libertas'') or servile (''servitus''), but they all had rights in law.&lt;ref&gt;Mears, T. Lambert, ''Analysis of M. Ortolan's Institutes of Justinian, Including the History and'', p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Edict of Milan]] in 313, these rights included the freedom of religion; however in 380, the [[Edict of Thessalonica]] required all subjects of the Roman Empire to profess Catholic Christianity.&lt;ref name="Fahlbusch"&gt;Fahlbusch, Erwin and Geoffrey William Bromiley, ''The encyclopedia of Christianity'', Volume 4, p. 703.&lt;/ref&gt; Roman legal doctrine was lost during the Middle Ages, but claims of universal rights could still be made based on Christian doctrine. According to the leaders of [[Kett's Rebellion]] (1549), "all bond men may be made free, for God made all free with his precious blood-shedding."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/humanrights/1500-1760/ |title=Human Rights: 1500-1760 - Background |publisher=Nationalarchives.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century, [[English common law]] judge Sir [[Edward Coke]] revived the idea of rights based on citizenship by arguing that Englishmen had historically enjoyed [[Rights of Englishmen|such rights]]. The [[Parliament of England]] adopted the [[English Bill of Rights]] in 1689. It was one of the influences drawn on by [[George Mason]] and [[James Madison]] when drafting the [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]] in 1776. The Virginia declaration is the direct ancestor and model for the [[U.S. Bill of Rights]] (1789).

The removal by legislation of a civil right constitutes a "civil disability". In early 19th century Britain, the phrase "civil rights" most commonly referred to the issue of such legal discrimination against Catholics. In the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] support for civil rights was divided, with many  politicians agreeing with the existing civil disabilities of Catholics. The [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829]] restored their civil rights.

In the 1860s, Americans adapted this usage to newly freed blacks. [[United States Congress|Congress]] enacted [[Civil Rights Act (disambiguation)|civil rights acts]] in [[Civil Rights Act of 1866|1866]], [[Civil Rights Act of 1871|1871]], [[Civil Rights Act of 1875|1875]], [[Civil Rights Act of 1957|1957]], [[Civil Rights Act of 1960|1960]], [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|1964]], [[Civil Rights Act of 1968|1968]], and [[Civil Rights Act of 1991|1991]].

==Protection of rights==
[[T. H. Marshall]] notes that civil rights were among the first to be recognized and codified, followed later by political rights and still later by social rights. In many countries, they are [[constitutional right]]s and are included in a [[bill of rights]] or similar document. They are also defined in [[international human rights instruments]], such as the 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and the 1967 [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]].

Civil and political rights need not be codified to be protected, although most [[Democracy|democracies]] worldwide do have formal written guarantees of civil and political rights. Civil rights are considered to be [[Natural and legal rights|natural rights]]. [[Thomas Jefferson]] wrote in his ''[[A Summary View of the Rights of British America]]'' that "a free people [claim] their rights as derived from the laws of nature, and not as the gift of their [[chief magistrate]]."

The question of to whom civil and political rights apply is a subject of controversy. In many countries, [[citizen]]s have greater protections against infringement of rights than non-citizens; at the same time, civil and political rights are generally considered to be universal rights that apply to all [[person]]s.

According to political scientist Salvador Santino F. Regilme Jr., analyzing the causes of and lack of protection from human rights abuses in the Global South should be focusing on the interactions of domestic and international factors—an important perspective that has usually been systematically neglected in the social science literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Regilme |first=Salvador Santino F., Jr. |date=3 October 2014 |title=The Social Science of Human Rights: The Need for a 'Second Image Reversed'? |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01436597.2014.946255 |work=[[Third World Quarterly]] |volume=35 |issue=8 |pages=1390–1405 |doi=10.1080/01436597.2014.946255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other rights==
[[Custom (law)|Custom]] also plays a role. Implied or [[unenumerated rights]] are rights that [[court]]s may find to exist even though not expressly guaranteed by written law or custom; one example is the [[right to privacy]] in the [[United States]], and the [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth Amendment]] explicitly shows that there are other rights that are also protected.

The [[United States Declaration of Independence]] states that people have unalienable rights including "Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness". It is considered by some that the sole purpose of government is the protection of life, liberty and property.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.legis.ga.gov/legis/2011_12/fulltext/hb4.htm House Bill 4] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001010710/http://www1.legis.ga.gov/legis/2011_12/fulltext/hb4.htm |date=2012-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social movements for civil rights==

Civil rights guarantee equal protection under the law. When civil and political rights are not guaranteed to all as part of equal protection of [[law]]s, or when such guarantees exist on paper but are not respected in practice, opposition, legal action and even [[social unrest]] may ensue.

Some historians suggest that [[New Orleans]] was the cradle of the civil rights movement in the United States, due to the earliest efforts of Creoles to integrate the military ''en masse''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eaton|first=Fernin|title=Louisiana's Free People of Color-Digitization Grant-letter in support|url=https://www.academia.edu/3505760/Louisianas_Free_People_of_Color-Digitization_grant_awarded_to_LSU_Hill_library_others|accessdate=June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; W.C.C. Claiborne, appointed by Thomas Jefferson to be governor of the Territory of Orleans, formally accepted delivery of the French colony on December 20, 1803. Free men of colour had been members of the militia for decades under both Spanish and French control of the colony of Louisiana. They volunteered their services and pledged their loyalty to Claiborne and to their newly adopted country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carter|first=Clarence|title=The Territorial Papers of the United States, Vol. IX, The Territory of Orleans|year=1940|page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this, in early 1804, the new U.S. administration in New Orleans, under Governor Claiborne, was faced with a dilemma previously unknown in the United States, i.e., the integration of the military by incorporating entire units of previously established "colored" militia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eaton|first=Fernin|title=1811 Slave Uprising, etc|url=https://www.academia.edu/1910804/Gov._Claiborne_in_his_own_words--a_salon_publique_at_Pitot_House_Bayou_St._John|work=Salon Publique, Pitot House, November 7, 2011|accessdate=June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; See, e.g., the February 20, 1804 letter to Claiborne from Secretary of War Henry Dearborn that "it would be prudent not to increase the Corps, but to diminish, if it could be done without giving offense".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rowland|first=Dunbar|title=Official Letter Books of W.C.C. Claiborne, 1801-1816|year=1917|publisher=Mississippi Dept. of Archives &amp; History|volume=2|pages=54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Worldwide, several [[political movement]]s for [[equality before the law]] occurred between approximately 1950 and 1980. These movements had a legal and constitutional aspect, and resulted in much law-making at both national and international levels. They also had an activist side, particularly in situations where violations of rights were widespread. Movements with the proclaimed aim of securing observance of civil and political rights included:

Most civil rights movements relied on the technique of [[civil resistance]], using [[nonviolent]] methods to achieve their aims.&lt;ref&gt;[[Adam Roberts (scholar)|Adam Roberts]] and [[Timothy Garton Ash]] (eds.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&amp;dq=Civil+resistance+and+power+politics&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present''], Oxford University Press, 2009. Includes chapters by specialists on the various movements.&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, struggles for civil rights were accompanied, or followed, by [[civil unrest]] and even armed rebellion. While civil rights movements over the last sixty years have resulted in an extension of civil and political rights, the process was long and tenuous in many countries, and many of these movements did not achieve or fully achieve their objectives.

==Problems and analysis==
Questions about civil and political rights have frequently emerged. For example, to what extent should the government intervene to protect individuals from infringement on their rights by other [[individual]]s, or from [[corporation]]s—e.g., in what way should [[employment discrimination]] in the [[private sector]] be dealt with?

[[Political theory]] deals with civil and political rights. [[Robert Nozick]] and [[John Rawls]] expressed competing visions in Nozick's ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]'' and Rawls' ''[[A Theory of Justice]]''. Other influential authors in the area include [[Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld]], and [[Jean Edward Smith]].

==First-generation rights==
First-generation rights, often called "purple" rights, deal essentially with liberty and participation in political life. They are fundamentally civil and political in nature, as well as strongly [[individual and group rights|individualistic]]: They serve [[negative and positive rights|negatively to protect]] the individual from excesses of the state. First-generation rights include, among other things, [[freedom of speech]], the [[right to a fair trial]], (in some countries) the [[right to keep and bear arms]], [[freedom of religion]] and [[voting rights]]. They were pioneered in the [[United States]] by the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] and in [[France]] by the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] in the 18th century, although some of these rights and the right to due process date back to the [[Magna Carta]] of 1215 and the [[Rights of Englishmen]], which were expressed in the [[English Bill of Rights]] in 1689.

They were enshrined at the global level and given status in [[international law]] first by Articles 3 to 21 of the 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and later in the 1966 [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]. In Europe, they were enshrined in the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] in 1953.

The civil rights movement was a struggle for social justice that took place mainly during the 1950s and 1960s for blacks to gain equal rights under the law in the United States. In 1868, the  14th amendment to the constitution gave blacks equal protection under the law.
In the 1960s, Americans who knew only the potential of "equal protection of the laws" expected the president, the Congress, and the courts to fulfill the promise of the 14th Amendment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2851">A '''comeback''', in terms of [[publicity]], is a return by a well-known person to the activity in which they initially obtained their fame. Comebacks can occur in all walks of life, and have been noted to occur in entertainment, sports, and politics.

A comeback may occur after a public figure has been forced to withdraw from the public eye due to a real or perceived scandal.

==Entertainment==
An entertainer may make a comeback after having been absent from their area of entertainment for a time.

In South Korea, [[Comeback (K-pop)]], talent agencies stage-manage the debut of new acts in order to create anticipation for the new act, which will often officially debut live on one of the main television music programs with a "debut stage". For the debut [[Single (music)|single]], acts will have an overall "[[gimmick|concept]]", a marketing hook, which influences the name of the act, clothes, choreography, catch phrases and how they are presented; within bands individual members will have a personal concept, this being a role that they will play within the band, e.g. leader, visual, maknae, rapper e.t.c. Once a rookie act's debut cycle has ended they enter their second promotional cycle with a "comeback", called as such even when the musician or group in question did not go on hiatus.&lt;ref name="ramstadwsj"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ramstad|first=Evan|title=Korea Counts Down Not Just To New Year, But to New Girls' Album|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2012/12/31/korea-counts-down-not-just-to-new-year-but-to-new-girls-album/|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=5 January 2013|quote=One of the unique things about album releases by K-pop artists is that they are routinely called 'comebacks' even when there's been no evidence that the musician or group went away or, in the conventional sports usage of the term, experienced a setback or loss.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each promotional cycle will be presented with its own concept.

==Sports==
{{distinguish|Comeback (sports)}}
In sports, a comeback occurs where an athlete or a team returns to success after a period of poor performance or inactivity. "The comeback may be the most compelling phenomenon in sports. ... Comebacks in individual sports like tennis, boxing, or golf occur more commonly than in team sports, as athletes in these games have more control over their destiny".&lt;ref&gt;Rick Swaine, ''Baseball's Comeback Players: Forty Major Leaguers Who Fell and Rose Again'' (2014), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
A politician may make a comeback after having left public life, either voluntarily or through loss of an election.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Shlomit Barnea, "Chronicles of the Comeback that Was and the One that Almost Was", in Asher Arian, Michal Shamir, ''The Elections in Israel 2009'' (2011), p. 146-147.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Old woman draught at Ratcliffe Highway.png|thumb|250px|right|Punishing a common scold in the [[ducking stool]]]]

In the [[common law]] of [[criminal law|crime]] in [[England and Wales]], a '''common [[wiktionary:scold|scold]]''' was a type of public nuisance—a troublesome and angry person who broke the public peace by habitually chastising, arguing and quarrelling with their neighbours. The majority of individuals punished for scolding were women, though men could also be labelled scolds. 

The offence, which was exported to North America with the colonists, was punished by monetary fines, but also by methods intended to publicly humiliate such as [[cucking stool|ducking]]: being placed in a chair and submerged in a river or pond. Although rarely prosecuted it remained on the [[statute book]]s in England and Wales until 1967.

==The offence and its punishment==

=== Medieval England ===
The offence of scolding developed from the late middle ages in England. It has been suggested that attempts to control and punish 'bad speech' increased after the [[Black Death in England|Black Death]], when demographic shift led to greater resistance and threats to the status quo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bardsley|first=Sandy|date=2006|title=Sin, Speech and Scolding in Late Medieval England|url=|journal=Fama: The Politics of Talk and Reputation in Medieval Europe, ed. Thelma Fenster and Daniel Lord Smail|volume=|pages=146-8|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This included prosecutions for scolding. Scolds were described using a number of Latin terms, including ''objurgator, garulator, rixator'' and ''litigator'', found in both masculine and feminine forms in medieval legal records and all referring to negative forms of speech, chatter, quarrelling or reproachment. Scolding offences were commonly presented and punished in [[Manorial court|manorial]] and borough courts that governed the behaviour of peasants and townspeople across England. Scolds were also presented in church courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/65767599|title=Gender and petty crime in late medieval England : the local courts in Kent, 1460-1560|last=Jones|first=Karen|date=2006|publisher=Boydell Press|year=|isbn=184383216X|location=Woodbridge|pages=104-106|oclc=65767599}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common punishment was a monetary fine.

Various historians have argued that scolding and bad speech were coded as feminine offences by the late medieval period. Women of all marital statuses were prosecuted for scolding, though married women featured most frequently, while widows were rarely labelled scolds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/891396093|title=Venomous tongues : speech and gender in late medieval England|last=Sandy,|first=Bardsley,|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780812239362|location=Philadelphia|pages=123-125|oclc=891396093}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some places, such as Exeter, scolds were typically poorer women, whereas elsewhere scolds could include members of the local elite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/891396093|title=Venomous tongues : speech and gender in late medieval England|last=Sandy,|first=Bardsley,|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780812239362|location=Philadelphia|pages=135-136|oclc=891396093}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women who were also charged with other offences, such as violence, nightwandering, eavesdropping or sexual impropriety were also likely to be labelled scolds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/891396093|title=Venomous tongues : speech and gender in late medieval England|last=Sandy,|first=Bardsley,|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780812239362|location=Philadelphia|pages=137|oclc=891396093}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals were frequently labelled 'common scolds', indicating the impact of their behaviour and speech on the whole community. Karen Jones identified 13 men prosecuted for scolding in Kent's secular courts, compared to 94 women and 2 couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/65767599|title=Gender and petty crime in late medieval England : the local courts in Kent, 1460-1560|last=1939-|first=Jones, Karen,|date=2006|publisher=Boydell Press|year=|isbn=184383216X|location=Woodbridge|pages=108|oclc=65767599}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men accused of scolding were often charged alongside their wives. Helen, wife of Peter Bradwall scolded Hugh Welesson and Isabel, his wife, in Middlewich in 1434, calling Isabel a "child murderer" and Hugh a "skallet [wretched] knave". Isabel and Hugh also scolded Helen, calling her a "lesyng blebberer" (lying bletherer). All parties were fined for the offences, though Hugh and Isabel were fined jointly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/891396093|title=Venomous tongues : speech and gender in late medieval England|last=Sandy,|first=Bardsley,|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780812239362|location=Philadelphia|pages=102|oclc=891396093}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like women, male scolds were often accused of many other offences, such as fornication, theft, illegal trading, and assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/891396093|title=Venomous tongues : speech and gender in late medieval England|last=Sandy,|first=Bardsley,|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780812239362|location=Philadelphia|pages=103|oclc=891396093}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Later punishments of scolding ===
Later legal treatises reflected the dominance of scolding as a female offence. In the ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', [[William Blackstone|Blackstone]] says of this offence:

{{quote|text=Lastly, a common scold, {{lang|la|communis rixatrix}}, (for our law-latin confines it to the feminine gender) is a public nuisance to her neighbourhood. For which offence she may be indicted; and, if convicted, shall be sentenced to be placed in a certain engine of correction called the trebucket, castigatory, or cucking stool, which in the Saxon language signifies the scolding stool; though now it is frequently corrupted into ducking stool, because the residue of the judgment is, that, when she is so placed therein, she shall be plunged in the water for her punishment.|sign=[[Commentaries on the Laws of England|Bl. Comm.]] IV:13.5.8, p. *169}} 
[[Image:The Branks from Curious Punishments of Bygone Days (1896) - 02.jpg|thumb|right|Scold's bridles or branks were probably used as a punishment but no official records of their use have been found.]]
The prescribed penalty for this offence involved dunking the convicted offender in water in an instrument called the "[[cucking stool]]".  The cucking stool, according to Blackstone, eventually became known as a ''ducking stool'' by [[folk etymology]].

Other writers disagree with Blackstone's assertion equating the two sorts of punishment seat.  The ''[[Domesday Book]]'' notes the use of a cucking stool at [[Chester]], a seat also known as {{lang|la|cathedra stercoris}}, a "dung chair", whose punishment apparently involved exposing the sitter's buttocks to onlookers.  This seat served to punish not only scolds, but also brewers and bakers who sold bad ale or bread, whereas the ducking stool dunked its victim into the water. [[Francois Maximilian Misson]], a French traveller and writer, recorded the method used in England in the early 18th century:&lt;ref name="AME"&gt;{{cite book |title=Curious Punishments of Bygone Days |chapter=The Ducking Stool |author=Alice Morse Earle |year=1896 |url=http://www.getchwood.com/punishments/curious/chapter-2.html |accessdate=18 January 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070117004233/http://www.getchwood.com/punishments/curious/chapter-2.html |archivedate=17 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=The way of punishing scolding women is pleasant enough. They fasten an armchair to the end of two beams twelve or fifteen feet long, and parallel to each other, so that these two pieces of wood with their two ends embrace the chair, which hangs between them by a sort of axle, by which means it plays freely, and always remains in the natural horizontal position in which a chair should be, that a person may sit conveniently in it, whether you raise it or let it down. They set up a post on the bank of a pond or river, and over this post they lay, almost in equilibrio, the two pieces of wood, at one end of which the chair hangs just over the water. They place the woman in this chair and so plunge her into the water as often as the sentence directs, in order to cool her immoderate heat.}}

The ducking stool, rather than being fixed in position by the river or pond, could be mounted on wheels to allow the convicted woman to be paraded through the streets before punishment was carried out. Another method of ducking was to use the tumbrel, which consisted of a chair on two wheels with two long shafts fixed to the axles. This would be pushed into the ducking pond and the shafts would be released, tipping the chair up backwards and ducking the occupant.&lt;ref name="ne"&gt;{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Ducking and Cucking Stools |volume=8 |page=361}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[scold's bridle]], known in Scotland as a brank, consists of a locking metal mask or [[head cage]] that contains a tab that fits in the mouth to inhibit talking. Some have claimed that convicted common scolds had to wear such a device as a preventive or punitive measure. Legal sources do not mention them in the context of the punishment of common scolds, but there are anecdotal reports of their historical use as a public punishment.&lt;ref name="Dugdale"&gt;{{cite book|title=England and Wales Delineated: Historical, Entertaining &amp; Commercial|author=Thomas Dugdale, William Burnett|year=1860|pages=1238}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LandC"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Transactions of the Historic Society of Lancashire and Cheshire|author=Frederick W. Fairholt|title=On a Grotesque Mask of Punishment Obtained in the Castle of Nuremberg|publisher=J.H. Parker for the Historic Society of Lancashire and Cheshire|location= 377, Strand. London|year=1855|pages=62–64|volume=VII}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 17th-century [[New England]] and [[Long Island]], scolds or those convicted of similar offences—both men and women—could be sentenced to stand with their tongue in a cleft stick, a more primitive but easier-to-construct version of the scold's bridle,&lt;ref name="AME2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Curious Punishments of Bygone Days|chapter=Branks and gags|author=Alice Morse Earle|year=1896|url=http://www.getchwood.com/punishments/curious/chapter-8.html|accessdate=18 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the ducking stool also made the trip across the Atlantic.&lt;ref name="AME" /&gt;

==Historical prosecutions==
[[Image:The Ducking-Stool from Curious Punishments of Bygone Days (1896).jpg|right|thumb|This [[woodcut]] shows the wheels on the ducking stool which allowed the occupant to be wheeled through the streets before being ducked.]]

A plaque on the Fye Bridge in [[Norwich]], England claims to mark the site of a "cucking" stool, and that from 1562–1597 "[[strumpet]]s" and common scolds suffered the punishment of dunking there.  In the ''Percy Anecdotes'', published pseudonymously by [[Thomas Byerley (journalist)|Thomas Byerley]] and [[Joseph Clinton Robertson]] in 1821{{ndash}}23, the authors state that "How long the ducking-stool has been in disuse in England does not appear."&lt;ref name="percy"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Percy Anecdotes|author=[[Reuben Percy]] and [[Sholto Percy]]|year=1823|publisher=Printed for T. Boys|location=London|url=http://www.mspong.org/percy/crime.htm#TheDuckingStool|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040910073842/http://www.mspong.org/percy/crime.htm#TheDuckingStool|archivedate=10 September 2004|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Anecdotes'' also suggest [[penology|penological]] ineffectiveness as grounds for the stool's disuse; the text relates the 1681 case of a Mrs. Finch, who according to this account had received three convictions and duckings as a common scold.  On her fourth conviction, the [[King's Bench]] declined to dunk her again, and instead ordered her to pay a fine of three [[mark (money)|marks]], and ordered her imprisoned until payment took place.

The ''Percy Anecdotes'' also quote a pastoral poem by [[John Gay]] (1685{{ndash}}1732), who wrote that:

{{poemquote|I'll speed me to the pond, where the high stool
On the long plank, hangs o'er the muddy pool,
That stool the dread of ev'ry scolding quean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spenserians.cath.vt.edu/TextRecord.php?textsid=33871 |title=The Shepherd's Week : Wednesday; or, The Dumps |author=John Gay |date=1714 |accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

and a 1780 poem by [[Benjamin West]], who wrote that:

{{poemquote|There stands, my friend, in yonder pool,
An engine call'd a ducking-stool;
By legal pow'r commanded down,
The joy and terror of the town.
If jarring females kindle strife...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/34005/34005-h/34005-h.htm#Page_11 |title=Curious Punishments of Bygone Days |author=Alice Morse Earle |website=Project Gutenberg |date=1896 |accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While these literary sources do not prove that the punishment still took place, they do provide evidence that it had not been forgotten.

In ''The Queen v. Foxby'', 6 Mod. 11 (1704), counsel for the accused stated that he knew of no law for the dunking of scolds.  Lord Chief Justice [[John Holt (judge)|John Holt]] of the Queen's Bench apparently pronounced this error, for he announced that it was "better ducking in a [[Trinity Sunday|Trinity]], than a [[Michaelmas]] [[quarter Sessions|term]]", i.e. better carried out in summer than in winter.  The tenor of Holt's remarks however suggests that he found the punishment an antiquarian curiosity and something of a joke.&lt;ref name="fc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/amendVIIIs19.html|title=The Founders Constitution:Volume 5, Amendment VIII, Document 19|year=1987|publisher=University of Chicago|accessdate=18 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The last recorded uses of the stool for ducking involve a Mrs. Ganble at [[Plymouth]] (1808) and Jenny Pipes, a notorious scold from  [[Leominster]] (1809). In 1817 Sarah Leeke, also from Leominster was sentenced to be ducked but the water in the pond was so low that the authorities merely wheeled her round the town in the chair.&lt;ref name="ne" /&gt;

The English common law as received by the law of the United States included the offence of being a common scold.  In 1829, a Washington, D.C. court found the American [[anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] writer [[Anne Royall]] guilty of being a common scold, the outcome of a campaign launched against her by local clergymen.  Despite the construction of the traditional engine of punishment by sailors at the Navy Yard, the court ruled the punishment of the cucking-stool obsolete, and instead improvised a fine of ten dollars.&lt;ref name="LC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/0001/royall.html|title=An Uncommon Scold|publisher=Library of Congress|author=Cynthia Earman|date=January 2001|accessdate=18 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current status of the law==
In England and Wales, the only part of the United Kingdom where the law had any effect, no prosecutions of common scolds occurred for a considerable period.{{vague|date=November 2017}} Counsel in ''Sykes v. Director of Public Prosecutions'' [1962] AC 528 described the offence as "obsolete", and section 13(1)(a) of the [[Criminal Law Act 1967]] eventually abolished it.

The common law offence of being a common scold was extant in New Jersey until struck down in 1972 by Circuit Judge McCann who found it had been subsumed in the provisions of the Disorderly Conduct Act of 1898, was bad for vagueness and offended the [[14th Amendment to the US Constitution]] for sex discrimination. Long before this decision, the punishment of ducking, together with all other forms of corporeal punishment, had become unlawful under the provisions of the [[New Jersey Constitution of 1844]] or even as early as 1776.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=State of New Jersey v. Marion Palendrano |vol= 120 N.J.

None of these laws carry the distinctive punishment originally reserved for the common scold, nor are they gender-specific as the common scold offense was.

In [[political science]], a  '''constitutional crisis''' is a problem or conflict in the function of a government that the [[constitution|political constitution]] or other fundamental governing law is perceived to be unable to resolve. There are several variations to this definition. For instance, one describes it as the crisis that arises out of the failure, or at least a strong risk of failure, of a constitution to perform its central functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Constitutions in the Global Financial Crisis: A Comparative Analysis|last=Contiades|first=Xenophon|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9781409466314|location=Oxon|pages=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crisis may arise from a variety of possible causes. For example, a government may want to pass a law contrary to its constitution; the constitution may fail to provide a clear answer for a specific situation; the constitution may be clear but it may be politically infeasible to follow it; the government institutions themselves may falter or fail to live up to what the law prescribes them to be; or officials in the government may justify avoiding dealing with a serious problem based on narrow interpretations of the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The 4 Types Of Constitutional Crises | author=Azari, Julia; Masket, Seth | date=February 9, 2017 | url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/constitutional-crisis/ | website=FiveThirtyEight}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Graber (2015), p. 244"&gt;{{cite book | title=A New Introduction to American Constitutionalism | author=Graber, Mark A. | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2015 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nHYRDAAAQBAJ | page=244}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific examples include the South African [[Coloured vote constitutional crisis]] in the 1950s, the [[Secession in the United States|secession of the southern U.S. states]] in 1860 and 1861, and the [[2007 Ukrainian political crisis|2007 Ukrainian crisis]]. 

Constitutional crises may arise from conflicts between different branches of government, conflicts between central and local governments, or simply conflicts among various factions within society. In the course of government, the crisis results when one or more of the parties to a [[Controversy|political dispute]] willfully chooses to violate a law of the [[constitution]]; or to flout an unwritten [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]]; or to dispute the correct, legal interpretation of the violated constitutional law or of the flouted political custom. This was demonstrated by the so-called [[XYZ Affair]], which involved the bribery of French officials by a contingent of American commissioners who were sent to preserve peace between [[France]] and the United States.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=From Many, One: Readings in American Political and Social Thought|last=Sinopoli|first=Richard|publisher=Georgetown University Press|year=1996|isbn=0878406263|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident was published in the American press and created a foreign policy crisis, which precipitated the passage of the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]]. Opposition to these acts in the form of the [[Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions|Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions]] cited that they violated the right to free speech and exhorted states to refuse their enforcement since they violated the Constitution.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Moreover, if the crisis arises because the constitution is legally ambiguous, the ultimate politico-legal resolution usually establishes the legal precedent to resolve future crises of constitutional administration. In the U.S. system of government, the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] does not explicitly address the matter of whether or not a state can legally [[Secession in the United States|secede]] from the Union; however, after the [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865) thwarted the secession of the [[Southern United States]], the accepted doctrine of constitutional law is that a state cannot legally leave the Union.{{Citation needed|reason=What specific doctrine?|date=June 2018}}

Politically, a constitutional crisis can lead to administrative paralysis and eventual collapse of the government, the loss of [[Legitimacy (political)|political legitimacy]], or to [[civil war]]. A constitutional crisis is distinct from a [[rebellion]], which occurs when political factions ''outside'' a government challenge the government's sovereignty, as in a ''[[coup d'état]]'' or a [[revolution]] led by the military or by civilians.

===Democratic Republic of the Congo===
[[File:PatricelumumbaIISG.jpg|thumb|220px|Patrice Lumumba]]
*President [[Joseph Kasavubu]] and Prime Minister [[Patrice Lumumba]] attempted to dismiss each other in September 1960. General [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] deposed both in a coup later that month, then restored Kasavubu as president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Catherine|last=Hoskyns|year=1968|title=The Congo since independence, January 1960-December, 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egypt===
*Egypt experienced a constitutional crisis when President Mubarak was removed and the country was left without a president until President Morsi was elected and then again when Morsi was arrested until President Al-Sisi took office.&lt;ref name="Egypt's"&gt;{{cite news|title=Q&amp;A: Egypt constitutional crisis|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-20554079|work=BBC|date=24 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Professor Hillel Frisch on Egypt"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Frisch|first1=Hillel|title=Egypt’s Constitutional Crisis|url=https://besacenter.org/perspectives-papers/egypts-constitutional-crisisthe-military-versus-the-islamists/#|accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malawi===
* A constitutional crisis occurred in Malawi in 2012 with regard to the succession of [[Bingu wa Mutharika]]. The President and Vice-President were from different parties which led to deliberations over who the rightful successor would be and the [[Malawian Constitutional Crisis 2012|constitutional crisis]]. Vice-President [[Joyce Banda]] eventually succeeded wa Mutharika.

===Republic of The Gambia===
* Following the victory of [[Adama Barrow]] in the [[Gambian presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election]], [[President of the Gambia|president]] [[Yahya Jammeh]] rejected the results and [[2016–2017 Gambian constitutional crisis|refused to step down]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/10/gambian-president-rejects-election-results-yahya-jammeh-adama-barrow|title=Gambian president Yahya Jammeh rejects election result |last= |first= |date=9 December 2016 |work= |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |agency=[[Reuters]] |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077 |access-date=19 January 2017 |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 January, Jammeh declared a 90-day state of emergency in an attempt to extend his term of office. [[Senegal]], [[Ghana]] and [[Nigeria|Nigerian]] forces entered [[the Gambia]] on 19 January to enforce the election results.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-38682184|publisher=BBC|date=January 19, 2017|accessdate=19 January 2017|title=Gambia crisis: Senegal troops 'enter' to back new president}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 January, Jammeh stepped down and left the country.

===Rhodesia===
* Amid demands from [[United Kingdom]] politicians to enfranchise the black majority population, the white minority government [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|unilaterally declared independence]] in 1965. The UK rejected the declaration and continued to claim sovereignty over Rhodesia until a framework for independence and black enfranchisement was negotiated in the 1979 [[Lancaster House Agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Nick|last=Barber|year=2012|title=The Constitutional State}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
* The [[Coloured vote constitutional crisis]] (1951–55): The [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] government disputed a court decision overturning its act to disenfranchise Coloured voters. Its attempt to reverse the decision in an ''ad hoc'' court was also overturned, after which the party used reforms to the Senate to pass the measure legally.

==Asia==

===Iran===
*[[Mohammed Reza Pahlavi]]'s 1953 dismissal of Prime Minister [[Mohammed Mossadegh]] and Mossadegh's subsequent refusal to quit the office

===Malaysia===
* [[1966 Sarawak constitutional crisis]] started by a group of politicians who were dissatisfied towards [[Stephen Kalong Ningkan]]'s leadership as chief minister. Ningkan was later removed from the chief minister post by the Governor of Sarawak in June 1966.
* The [[1983 Malaysian constitutional crisis]] saw [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Prime Minister]] [[Mahathir bin Mohamad|Mahathir]] pushing forward an amendment of Article 66 of the Federal Constitution, which set the time limit of the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong|Malaysian monarch]] to veto a law within 30 days. The proposals generated a great deal of controversy between the government and the monarchy, of which the former had to launch a public campaign to pressure the monarchy to assent to the amendments..{{clarify|date=November 2010}}
* The [[1988 Malaysian constitutional crisis]] was a series of events that began with the [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO) party elections in 1987 and ended with the suspension and the eventual removal of [[Lord President of the Supreme Court]] [[Malay titles#Tun|Tun]] [[Salleh Abas]] from his seat.
* The [[1993 amendments to the Constitution of Malaysia]] (by some interpretations a constitutional crisis) involved the limitation of monarchs' [[sovereign immunity|legal immunity]] in Malaysia. Prime Minister [[Mahathir bin Mohamad]] successfully amended the constitution to make the monarchies more accountable to their actions.
*The [[2009 Perak constitutional crisis]] occurred in the Malaysian state of [[Perak]] when [[party switching|party defections]] caused the state ruling coalition, [[Pakatan Rakyat]], to lose its majority in the [[Dewan Undangan Negeri|state assembly]]. The [[Sultan of Perak]] refused to dissolve the state assembly when requested and dismissed the [[Menteri Besar]] (Chief Minister) in the absence of a [[motion of no confidence|no confidence]] vote.{{clarify|date=November 2010}}

===Pakistan===
*Supreme Court Chief Justice [[Sajjad Ali Shah]] clashed repeatedly with Prime Minister [[Nawaz Sharif]] in late 1997, accusing him of undermining the court's independence. After Ali Shah suspended a constitutional amendment that prevented dismissal of the prime minister, Sharif ordered President [[Farooq Leghari]] to appoint a new chief justice. When Leghari refused, Sharif considered [[impeach]]ing him, but backed down after a warning from the armed forces. Faced with a choice of accepting Sharif's demands or dismissing him, Leghari resigned. Ali Shah resigned shortly afterward, establishing Sharif's dominance.

===Thailand===
*In March 2006, 60 seats of the [[National Assembly of Thailand]] could not be elected, and Prime Minister [[Thaksin Shinawatra]] refused to resign. The judicial system did not lead up to Supreme Court as the top arbitrator so there were inconsistent rulings from the civil, criminal, administrative, and constitutional Courts.{{clarify|date=July 2012}}

===Sri Lanka===
{{main|2018 Sri Lankan constitutional crisis}}
*On the 26th of October 2018, President [[Maithripala Sirisena]] appointed former President [[Mahinda Rajapaksa]] as Prime Minister and dismissed incumbent Prime Minister [[Ranil Wickremesinghe]]. Ranil Wickremesinghe refused to accepted the dismissal while stating its unconstitutional and undemocratic.

==Europe==

===Belgium===
*The [[Royal Question]] over the status of king [[Leopold III of Belgium|Leopold III]] began when he acted against [[advice (constitutional)|ministerial advice]] during the [[Battle of Belgium|1940 Nazi invasion]] and refused to join [[Belgian government in exile|the government in exile]]. Deported to Germany before [[Liberation of Belgium|Belgium's 1944 liberation]], Leopold's return was narrowly approved in [[Belgian monarchy referendum, 1950|a 1950 referendum]] but a subsequent general strike prompted him to abdicate the following year.
*In 1990, [[Baudouin I of Belgium|King Baudouin]] refused routine [[Royal Assent]] to the law on [[abortion in Belgium]].  The issue was resolved by (constitutionally but controversially) having Baudouin temporarily declared incapable of reigning, the Council of Ministers giving assent as provided for in the [[Belgian Constitution]], and Baudouin declared capable again.

===Denmark===
*The [[Easter Crisis of 1920]], when [[Christian X of Denmark|King Christian X]] of [[Denmark]] dismissed the country's cabinet.

===England===
{{hatnote|For events after the formation of the United Kingdom in 1707, see {{section link|#United Kingdom}} below.}}

[[Image:Joao sem terra assina carta Magna.jpg|thumb|220px|right|''John of England signs Magna Carta''. Illustration from ''Cassell's History of England'' (1902)]]
*The succession crisis following the death of [[Edward the Confessor]] in 1066, settled by the invasion by [[William the Conqueror]]
*The  ''[[White Ship]]'' tragedy of 1120, which led to the succession crisis called [[The Anarchy]].
*The 1215 Barons' revolt against the rule of [[John of England|King John]], which led to the [[Magna Carta]].  Immediately, John repudiated Magna Carta, leading to the [[First Barons' War]]
*The [[History of the Church of England#Separation from Papal authority|Break with Rome]], in which [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] repudiated [[papal authority]] and created himself [[Supreme Head of the Church of England]], leading to the [[English Reformation]]
*[[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]'s insistence on the [[Divine Right of Kings]], manifest in his [[Personal Rule]] from 1629 to 1640, and leading directly to the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]
*The [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688–89: The flight of [[James II of England|King James II/VII]] from the country left no king in his place to rule England or Scotland or to summon a [[Parliament]].  When [[William III of England|King William]] and [[Mary II of England|Queen Mary]] jointly replaced him there was therefore no legally recognised Parliament to legitimise their irregular succession to the throne. This led to the [[Crown and Parliament Recognition Act 1689]].

===Estonia===
*The early 1930s political crisis in [[Estonia]] as two constitutional reforms had been rejected by the electorate and only the [[Estonian constitutional referendum, October 1933|third referendum]] in 1933 succeeded in replacing the [[parliamentary republic]] with the [[presidential republic]]. The succeeding constitutional reform was proposed by the [[Vaps Movement]], who were however kept from power by the [[self-coup]] of [[Prime Minister of Estonia|Prime Minister]] [[Konstantin Päts]], who was supported by the [[Riigikogu]].

===France===
*The [[16 May 1877 crisis]]: President [[Patrice de Mac-Mahon]] dismissed Prime Minister [[Jules Simon]] and named [[Albert de Broglie]] to replace him. The [[National Assembly]] refused to recognize the new government and a crisis, which ended with the dissolution of the Assembly and new elections, ensued.

===Germany===
* In the [[Weimar Republic]], for several years the country was governed with the help of [[enabling act]]s and emergency decrees. The crisis became dramatic in 1932, when the [[Nazi Party]] and [[Communist Party of Germany]] had together a majority in the parliament. Any government, installed by the [[President of Germany (1919–45)|Reich President]], was likely to be dismissed by the parliament. The crisis ended in a Nazi and conservative coalition government and then Nazi dictatorship. The [[Weimar Constitution|Weimar constitution]] was not abolished but made obsolete.

===Malta===
*The [[Maltese general election, 1981|1981 election]], when, due to a quirk in that country's [[Single Transferrable Vote]] system, the party winning more than half the votes won fewer than half the seats in parliament.

===Norway===
*[[Impeachment (Norway)|Impeachment]] of prime minister Selmer's cabinet in 1883/1884 regarding the king's right to veto changes to the constitution, and establishment of an ad-hoc parliamentary practice until amended to the constitution in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[[Monarchy of Norway#Council of State]]{{Better source|reason=self-ref|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Storting]]{{Better source|reason=self-ref|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.liberaleren.no/2007/02/20/parlamentarismen-inn-i-grunnloven/&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905]]{{Elucidate|date=November 2018}}

===Rome===
*The crossing of the [[Rubicon]] by [[Julius Caesar]] in 49 BC with his legions. This action, which had no precedent, precipitated a crisis only fully resolved in 31 BC, when [[Augustus|Octavian]] defeated all his enemies to become the sole master of the Roman world.

===Russia===
*The [[Russian constitutional crisis of 1993|constitutional crisis of 1993]]: a conflict between [[President of Russia|Russian President]] [[Boris Yeltsin]] and the Russian parliament led by [[Ruslan Khasbulatov]]. It emerged due to disagreements regarding the demarcation of political authority. Russian leaders agreed to hold a referendum in April 1993 that would determine whether the presidency or the parliament would be the dominant institution in the Russian political system.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Presidential Power in Russia|last=Huskey|first=Eugene|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9781315482194|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parliament temporarily reneged on its commitment to a referendum and it prompted Yeltsin to issue a decree giving the president more authority. This was met with resistance even from among figures within the executive department such as Yurii Shokov, chair of the president's Security Council and [[Aleksandr Rutskoy]], Yeltsin's Vice President.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Anticipating impeachment, Yeltsin dissolved the parliament in September 21, 1993 and called for fresh elections.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Politics and the Russian Army: Civil-Military Relations, 1689-2000|last=Taylor|first=Brian|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|isbn=0521816742|location=Cambridge|pages=282}}&lt;/ref&gt; The president did not have the constitutional authority to do this and the Constitutional Court promptly ruled that the decree was unconstitutional.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This resulted to ten days of street fighting between the police, pro-parliamentary demonstrators, and groups loyal to the president.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of the Russian Federation|last=Saunders|first=Robert|last2=Strukov|first2=Vlad|publisher=The Scarecrow Press, Inc.|year=2010|isbn=|location=Lanham, MD|pages=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aleksandr Rutskoy was sworn as the acting President of Russia for a few days. The crisis ended after a military siege of the parliament building, which claimed 187 lives. 

===Scotland===
This covers the [[Kingdom of Scotland]], which became part of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] after 1707. For constitutional crises since then, see [[Constitutional crisis#Constitutional Crises in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] below.
*The succession crisis resulting from the death of [[Margaret of Scotland (Maid of Norway)|Queen Margaret]] in 1290. [[Edward I of England]], whose [[Edward II of England|son Edward]] was to marry Margaret, was asked to arbitrate, and chose [[John Balliol]], who swore an [[oath of fealty]] to Edward, turning Scotland into an English vassal in 1292.  Soon, Balliol and the [[Scottish nobility]] revolted, leading to the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]].

===Spain===
[[File:President_Puigdemont,_"Ciutadans_de_Catalunya,_vénen_hores_en_què_a_tots_ens_pertocarà_de_mantenir_el_pols_del_nostre_país"_02.jpg|thumb|[[President of the Generalitat of Catalonia|Catalan president]], [[Carles Puigdemont]], addresses the crowd following the unilateral declaration of independence on 27 October]]
*The [[2017–18 Spanish constitutional crisis]] saw the [[Government of Spain]] and the [[Generalitat of Catalonia]] clashing over the latter's planning of an [[Catalan independence referendum, 2017|independence referendum]] on 1 October 2017, leading to the Catalan government openly defying instructions from the [[Spanish Constitutional Court]] and in state prosecutors filling criminal charges on Catalan leading officials for rebellion, disobedience, misusing public funds and making deliberately unlawful decisions. General strikes and tense demonstrations took place during these weeks. On 27 October, the [[Parliament of Catalonia]] tried to found a Catalan republic with a [[Catalan declaration of independence|unilateral declaration of independence]]. At the same time, the [[Senate of Spain|Senate]] approved the application of [[Constitution of Spain#Article 155|Article 155]] of the [[Constitution of Spain|Constitution]], which led to the cessation of the Catalan Government, the dissolution of parliament, the call for [[Catalan regional election, 2017|elections]] for 21 December and the direct rule over Catalonia. The [[Supreme Court of Spain|Supreme Court]] imprisoned a large part of the Puigdemont executive, the [[Carme Forcadell|Speaker of the Parliament]] and the two leaders of the two major independentists civil associations, as well as the flight to Belgium, Switzerland, Germany and Scotland of President [[Puigdemont]], four regional ex-regional ministers and two political leaders. For July 2018, the direct rule ended and the prisoners are still in preventive jail in Catalan prisons.

===United Kingdom===
*The rejection of the 1909 [[People's Budget]] by the [[House of Lords]]. This caused a two-year impasse, leading to the [[Parliament Act 1911]].&lt;ref name="bogdanor"&gt;{{cite book|first=Vernon|last=Bogdanor|year=1997|title=The Monarchy and the Constitution}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The 1936 [[Edward VIII abdication crisis]], when [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VIII]] proposed to marry divorcee [[Wallis, The Duchess of Windsor|Wallis Simpson]] against the advice of his ministers.

==North America==

===Canada===
*In the [[King-Byng Affair]] of 1926, [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Viscount Byng of Vimy]] refused the request of [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] to [[dissolution of parliament|dissolve Parliament]] and call new elections after King had, months before, refused to resign.  Instead, Byng dismissed King and appointed [[Arthur Meighen]] as Prime Minister, after which Meighen found himself unable to retain [[confidence (politics)|confidence]], triggering his own resignation and an election.  Reaction to the affair was reflected in the [[Balfour Declaration of 1926]], the resulting separation of [[British Dominions|Dominion]] [[Governors General]] from the British government, and the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]] that made each realm of the Crown independent.
*The 1936 [[Edward VIII abdication crisis]], when [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VIII]] proposed to marry divorcee [[Wallis, The Duchess of Windsor|Wallis Simpson]] against the advice of his ministers.
*The 1982 [[patriation]] of the [[British North America Act]] was contentious, as there were conflicting opinions from the federal government, provincial governments, and [[Supreme Court of Canada|Supreme Court]] over what exactly the procedure was whereby Canada could request a [[constitutional amendment]] from [[the United Kingdom]].  The Supreme Court's decision in the [[Quebec Veto Reference]] found that [[Quebec]] did not have a veto on patriation, and the process was legitimate and binding.  The [[National Assembly of Quebec]] symbolically refuses to ratify the Constitution Act in its current form.&lt;!-- Is this a crisis?  The government seems to have continued operating since 1982. --&gt;{{cn|date=January 2017}}
*The [[2008–2009 Canadian parliamentary dispute]], in which [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]], [[New Democratic Party|NDP]], and [[Bloc Québécois]] Members of Parliament attempted to have a vote of non-confidence against the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] government and replace it with a coalition government, was unprecedented in the Canadian constitutional system, as formal party-based co-operation was rare. [[Stephen Harper|Prime Minister Stephen Harper]] controversially advised the Governor General to [[Prorogation in Canada|prorogue]] Parliament. The coalition effort subsequently fell apart, leaving the key questions around the dispute unanswered.

===Honduras===
*The [[2009 Honduran constitutional crisis]] saw President [[Manuel Zelaya]] attempting to hold a non-binding referendum which [[National Congress of Honduras|Congress]] and the [[Supreme Court of Honduras|Supreme Court]] deemed unconstitutional. The military, following orders from the Supreme Court, arrested President Zelaya.

===United States===
[[File:Electoral Commission (United States).jpg|right|thumb|220px|The Electoral Commission was a panel that resolved the disputed presidential election of 1876.]]

*The [[Stamp Act 1765]], by which the British Parliament sought to tax the [[Thirteen Colonies]], set off protests from colonial politicians against [[taxation without representation]]. Parliament continued to assert its authority in subsequent acts, throwing colonial governments into chaos and eventually leading the colonists to declare total independence from Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=H. T.|last=Dickinson|year=2014|title=Britain and the American Revolution}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Nullification Crisis]] of 1832, in which [[South Carolina]] declared that it would not permit collection of a federal tariff.  The United States Congress eventually passed a law to authorize the President to use military force in South Carolina to enforce federal laws, as well as a revised tariff law with lower rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Richard E.|last=Ellis|year=1989|title=The Union at Risk: Jacksonian Democracy, States' Rights and the Nullification Crisis}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1841 the death of President [[William Henry Harrison]] resulted in Vice-President [[John Tyler]] becoming President, the first vice-president to succeed to the presidency. He assumed full presidential powers, although there was doubt whether the actual office of President "devolved" upon the Vice President or merely its powers and duties. The "Tyler Precedent" governed future successions and eventually became codified in the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-fifth Amendment]]. Some opposition Whig members of Congress, including [[John Quincy Adams]] and [[Henry Clay]], held that Tyler should be a [[Caretaker government#Caretakers|caretaker]] under the title of [[Acting President of the United States|"Acting President"]]. He was referred to as "His Accidency".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|access-date=January 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, both houses of Congress adopted a resolution confirming that Tyler was the tenth President of the United States without any qualification. Unsuccessful amendments had been proposed in both houses to strike out the word "President" in favor of language including the term "Vice President" for such cases. Tyler had correspondence from his political opponents to the White House addressed to the "Vice President" or "Acting President" returned unopened.&lt;ref name="Abbott2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Philip Abbott|title=Accidental Presidents: Death, Assassination, Resignation, and Democratic Succession|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NdzGAAAAQBAJ|date=23 June 2008|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-230-61303-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Secession in the United States|secession]] of seven [[Southern United States|Southern]] [[U.S. state|states]] in 1861, which the federal government did not recognize, leading to the [[American Civil War]].
*[[United States presidential election, 1876|1876 presidential election]]: [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] disputed voting results in three states. An ''ad hoc'' [[Electoral Commission (United States)|Electoral Commission]], created by [[United States Congress|Congress]], voted along party lines in favor of Republican candidate [[Rutherford B. Hayes]], who damped Southern fury by withdrawing federal troops from the South, ending [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]].
* In the [[Watergate scandal]] (1972–74), President [[Richard Nixon]] and his staff obstructed investigations into their political activities. Nixon resigned, under threat of impeachment, after the release of an audio tape showing that he had personally approved the obstruction. Congressional moves to restrain presidential authority continued for years afterward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Harry|last=Pohlman|year=2005|title=Constitutional Debate in Action: Governmental Powers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Michael|last=Schudson|year=1992|title=Watergate in American Memory}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Saturday Night Massacre|dismissal of independent special prosecutor]] [[Archibald Cox]], and the resignations of [[Attorney General of the United States|Attorney General]] [[Elliot Richardson]] and Deputy Attorney General [[William Ruckelshaus]] on October 20, 1973, led to the [[Independent Counsel Act]] for a more impartial way of investigating high-level public integrity cases in the executive branch without interference from the President or other executive branch leaders. Prior to the Independent Counsel Act a Special Prosecutor was still under the authority of the President and any investigations into the executive branch could be stopped by the President by simply firing the Special Prosecutor.

==Oceania==

===Australia===
*The 1936 [[Edward VIII abdication crisis]], when [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VIII]] proposed to marry divorcee [[Wallis, The Duchess of Windsor|Wallis Simpson]] against the advice of his ministers.
*The [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis]] saw the [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Gough Whitlam]] and his government dismissed by the nation's [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] [[John Kerr (governor-general)|Sir John Kerr]], in response to a prolonged budget deadlock in Parliament.  This occurred even though Whitlam's government had the [[confidence (politics)|confidence]] of the lower house, the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].

===Fiji===
*In the [[1977 Fijian constitutional crisis|Fiji constitutional crisis of 1977]], the winning party in a general election failed to name a government due to internal conflicts. The [[Governor-General of Fiji|Governor-General]] intervened, appointing a prime minister from the opposition party.

*The 1936 [[Edward VIII abdication crisis]], when [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VIII]] proposed to marry divorcee [[Wallis, The Duchess of Windsor|Wallis Simpson]] against the advice of his ministers.
*The [[New Zealand constitutional crisis, 1984|New Zealand constitutional crisis of 1984]] was caused by [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]] [[Rob Muldoon|Sir Rob Muldoon]]'s refusal to devalue the [[New Zealand dollar|dollar]] as per the instructions of the Prime Minister-elect, [[David Lange]].  The outgoing cabinet rebelled against Muldoon, who relented.  The upshot was the passage of the [[Constitution Act 1986 (NZ)|Constitution Act]], which patriated the constitution from the United Kingdom.

===Papua New Guinea===
*The [[2011–2012 Papua New Guinean constitutional crisis|Papua New Guinean constitutional crisis of 2011–2012]] was caused by a disagreement, involving every branch of government including the [[Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea|Supreme Court]], as to who the legitimate [[Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea|Prime Minister]] was. Specifically, whether Prime Minister [[Michael Somare]]'s dismissal by the Speaker of the [[National Parliament of Papua New Guinea|National Parliament]] while he was in hospital had been lawful. After ten months, the crisis was resolved peacefully by [[Papua New Guinean general election, 2012|a general election]].

===Tuvalu===
*The [[Tuvaluan constitutional crisis|Tuvaluan constitutional crisis of 2013]] occurred when Prime Minister [[Willy Telavi]] sought to continue governing after having lost his parliamentary majority. He deferred allowing Parliament to sit, and his ally Speaker [[Kamuta Latasi]] did not allow a [[motion of no confidence]] to be tabled when it finally did sit. The Opposition accused the government of acting unconstitutionally, and [[Governor General of Tuvalu|Governor General]] Sir [[Iakoba Italeli]] intervened, removing the Prime Minister from office so that Parliament could decide who should form the government. Telavi sought in vain to ask the [[monarchy of Tuvalu|Queen of Tuvalu]], [[Elizabeth II]], to remove the Governor General. Parliament elected Opposition Leader [[Enele Sopoaga]] to the premiership.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:Declared death ''in absentia''}}
{{globalize/West|date=November 2013}}
{{more citations needed|date=June 2009}}

A person may be legally '''declared death {{lang|la|in absentia}}''' or '''legal presumption of death''' despite the absence of direct proof of the person's death, such as the finding of remains (e.g., a [[cadaver|corpse]] or skeleton) attributable to that person. Such a declaration is typically made when a person has been [[missing person|missing]] for an extended period of time and in the absence of any evidence that the person is still alive &amp;ndash; or after a much shorter period but where the circumstances surrounding a person's disappearance overwhelmingly support the belief that the person has died (e.g., an [[Aviation accidents and incidents|airplane crash]]).

A declaration that a person is dead resembles other forms of "preventive adjudication", such as the [[declaratory judgment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|ssrn=1483859|last=Bray |first=Samuel L. |year=2010 |page=1275 |title=Preventive Adjudication |journal=University of Chicago Law Review |volume=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Different jurisdictions have different legal standards for obtaining such a declaration and in some jurisdictions a legal presumption of death may arise after a person has been missing under certain circumstances and a certain amount of time.

==Facts, circumstances, and the "balance of probabilities"==
In most [[common law]] and [[civil code]] jurisdictions, it is usually necessary to obtain a [[court order]] directing the registrar to issue a [[death certificate]] in the absence of a physician's certification that an identified individual has died.  However, if there is [[circumstantial evidence]] that would lead a reasonable person to believe that the individual is deceased on the [[balance of probabilities]], jurisdictions may agree to issue death certificates without any such order.  For example, [[Passengers of the RMS Titanic|passengers and crew]] of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] who were not rescued by the [[RMS Carpathia|RMS ''Carpathia'']] were declared legally dead soon after ''Carpathia'' arrived at [[New York City]]. More recently, death certificates for those who perished in the [[September 11 attacks]] were issued by the [[New York State|State of New York]] within days of the tragedy. The same is usually true of [[soldier]]s [[Missing in action|missing after a major battle]], especially if the enemy keeps an accurate record of its [[prisoners of war]].

If there is not sufficient evidence that death has taken place, it may take somewhat longer, as simple absence does not necessarily prove death. The requirements for declaring an individual legally dead may vary depending on numerous details including the following:
* The jurisdiction the individual lived in before death
* The jurisdiction where they are presumed to have died
* How the individual is thought to have died ([[murder]], [[suicide]], [[accident]], etc.)
* The balance of probabilities that make it more likely than not that the individual is dead

Most countries have a set period of time (seven years in many [[common law]] jurisdictions) after which an individual is presumed dead if there is no evidence to the contrary. However, if the missing individual is the owner of a significant estate, the court may delay ordering the issuing of a death certificate if there has been no real effort to locate the missing person. If the death is thought to have taken place in [[international waters]] or in a location without a centralized and reliable police force or vital statistics registration system, other laws may apply.

==Legal aspects==
===China===
The Chinese law treats declaratory judgment of death and disappearance differently. Relevant provisions can be found in Section 3 ("Declaration of Disappearance and Declaration of Death"), Chapter 2 ("Natural Persons") of the ''General Provisions of the Civil Law of the People's Republic of China''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npc.gov.cn/npc/xinwen/2017-03/15/content_2018907.htm npc.gov.cn]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.pkulaw.cn/display.aspx?cgid=291593&amp;lib=law pkulaw.cn]&lt;/ref&gt; enacted in 2017.

In terms of the declaration of disappearance, where a natural person has disappeared for two years, an interested party may apply to a people's court for a declaration of absence of the natural person. The period of disappearance of a natural person shall be counted from the day when he or she is not heard from. If a person disappears during a war, the period of disappearance shall be counted from the day when the war ends or from the date of absence as confirmed by the relevant authority.

As for the declaration of death, where a natural person falls under any of the following circumstances, an interested party may apply to a people's court for a declaration of death of the natural person: 

# The natural person has disappeared for four years;
# The natural person has disappeared for two years from an accident.

Where a person has disappeared from an accident, and it is impossible for the person to survive the accident as certified by the relevant authority, an application for a declaration of death of the person is not subject to the two-year period.

In the event of contradictory applications for declaration, meaning that both an application for a declaration of death and an application for a declaration of absence of the same natural person are filed by the interested parties with a people's court, the people's court shall declare the death of the person if the conditions for a declaration of death as set out in this Law are met.

The Chinese law specifically talks about the return of the absentee. The validity of the previous declaratory judgment of death is not imperiled by the sheer fact of return. The absentee or interested party (or parties) must apply for the revocation of the said declaratory judgment, then can it be annulled. The legal consequence of revoking declaratory judgment is essentially about restoration, i.e. the return of property and restoration of marriage. Chinese legislator made a rather peculiar choice to restore marriage between the absentee and his or her spouse, providing that the spouse has not remarried or declared unwillingness of restoring marriage. This is quite unusual among the legal regimes around the world.
===India===
Presumption of death is governed by sections 107 and 108 of the Evidence Act, which allows for presumption of death for a person missing for 7 years to be raised in appropriate proceedings before the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Missing-persons-death-date-is-day-court-declares-so/articleshow/27440309.cms |date=10 December 2013|access-date=11 April 2017|title=Missing person's death date is day court declares so |publisher=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
If there is strong evidence a missing person is dead the coroner may request an inquest under Section 23 of the Coroners Act 1962.  If the Minister for Justice grants the inquest then the person may be declared legally dead if that is the outcome of the inquest.  As an alternative an application may be made to the high court, normally this is after at least 7 years of going missing, but exceptionally may be earlier if there is strong implication from the circumstances the person is dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/death/sudden_or_unexplained_death/missing_presumed_dead.html |access-date=11 April 2017 |title=Missing, presumed dead |publisher=Citizens Information Board}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
It takes 20 years in Italy to declare a missing person dead. After ten years from somebody's disappearance, a motion to declare the person legally dead can be filed in a court of law. After that, another ten years must pass before the person can eventually be declared legally dead.

===Poland===
Declaration of death {{lang|la|in absentia}} is derived from articles 29–32 of Polish Civil Code and exercised as a court sentence. In a general case, 10 years is a timespan of disappearance required for the legal declaration, but the following exceptions apply:
* no one is declared dead before the end of the year in which one becomes 23 years old;
* the timespan of disappearance is reduced to 5 years if the person would be 70 years old or more at the time of declaration;
* if a person would have been a victim of an air or a sea disaster or in an "other exceptional happening", the disappearance timespan is reduced to 6 months, however if the vessel is presumably lost, the time starts to count 1 year after the unkept scheduled day of arrival or 2 years after the last known whereabouts;
* if a person is missing in another life-threatening event (different than the above), the timespan is 1 year since the life-threatening event ceased.
A court's declaration of death {{lang|la|in absentia}} produces legal effects valid from before the date of the declaration, and going back to the assumed day of death (as declared by the court).

===Russia===
According to article 45 of [[Civil Code of Russia]], a person may be declared dead {{lang|la|in absentia}} only by a court decision, on the following grounds:
* He has been missing for 5 years
* If the person disappeared under life-threatening circumstances, which made it likely that he or she died from an accident, that person can be assumed dead after 6 months
* A military or civil person, who disappeared during a military conflict, can be declared dead no earlier than 2 years after the conflict is over

A legal date of death is considered to be the date when the court decision declaring person dead was made. If a person disappeared under life-threatening circumstances, the day of his or her actual disappearance may also be considered the legal date of death.

The declaration of death {{lang|la|in absentia}} by the court has the same legal consequences as if the fact of death was proven:
* [[Dependant]]s of the person become eligible for the state pension
* Assets can be [[Inheritance|inherited]]
* If the person was married, the marriage legally ends
* Personal obligations are terminated

If such decision was a mistake and the person later returned, the decision is nullified and the person becomes eligible to request most of his assets back. However, if the husband or wife of such person married again, the marriage will not be restored. His funds and securities, taken under bona fide circumstances, also cannot be requested back.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_5142/807f0f66520608de738f73f326a9b309ac205a32/ consultant.ru] ГК РФ Статья 45. Объявление гражданина умершим&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
====England and Wales====
==== Before 2013 ====
[[English law]] generally assumes a person is dead if, after seven years:
* There has been no evidence that they are still alive.
* The people most likely to have heard from them have had no contact.
* Inquiries made of that person have had no success.&lt;ref name="Committee"&gt;House of Commons Justice Committee, Presumption of Death, Twelfth Report of Session 2010–12 Report, 7 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
This is a rebuttable presumption at common law—if the person subsequently appears, the law no longer considers them dead.

Otherwise, courts may grant leave to applicants to swear that a person is dead (within or after the seven-year period).&lt;ref name="Committee"/&gt; For example, an executor may make such an application so they can be granted probate for the will.  This kind of application would only be made sooner than seven years where death is probable, but not definitive (such as an unrecovered plane crash at sea), following an inquest (see below).  Such an application is specific to the court where it is made—thus separate applications must be made at a coroner's inquest, for proceedings under the Matrimonial Causes and Civil Partnership Acts (for remarriage), for [[probate]], and under the Social Security Act.

==== Presumption of Death Act 2013 ====
These processes were not considered satisfactory, and so in February–March 2013, the '''Presumption of Death Act 2013''' was passed to simplify this process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite legislation UK|type=act|year=2013|chapter=13|act=Presumption of Death Act 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new act, which is based on the Presumption of Death (Scotland) Act 1977,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2013-03-27 |url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/387404/Presumption-of-death-act-welcomed |title=Presumption of death act welcomed |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |newspaper=Daily Express |accessdate=2015-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; allows applying to the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] to declare a person presumed dead. This declaration is conclusive and cannot be appealed. It is recorded on a new Register of Presumed Deaths, and has the same effect as a registration of death. Death is taken to occur on (a) the last day that they could have been alive (if the court is satisfied that they are dead), or (b) the day seven years after the date they were last seen (if death is presumed by the elapse of time).

In [[England and Wales]], if the authorities believe there should be an [[inquest]], the local [[coroner]] files a report. This may be done to help a family receive a death certificate that may bring some closure. An inquest strives to bring any suspicious circumstances to light. The coroner then applies to the [[Secretary of State for Justice]], under the Coroners Act 1988 section 15, for an inquest with no body. The seven years rule only applies in the [[High Court of Justice]] on the settlement of an estate. According to a spokesman for the [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]], the number of requests received each year is fewer than ten, but few of these are refused. Without a body, an inquest relies mostly on evidence provided by the [[police]], and whether senior officers believe the missing person is dead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7128867.stm "When is a missing person declared dead?"] BBC News, 5 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; One notable person presumed dead under the Act is the [[John Bingham, 7th Earl of Lucan|7th Earl of Lucan]] (Lord Lucan), who was last seen alive in 1974 (although there have been numerous alleged sightings since that time), and whose death certificate was issued in February 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-35481376 "Lord Lucan death certificate granted"]. BBC News, 3 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The incidence of presumed death in England and Wales is considered low – in September 2011, it was estimated that only 1% of the 200,000 missing persons each year remained unaccounted for after 12 months, with a cumulative total of 5,500 missing persons by September 2011.&lt;ref name="Committee"/&gt;

====Scotland====
In Scotland, legal aspects of death {{lang|la|in absentia}} are outlined in the '''Presumption of Death (Scotland) Act 1977'''. If a person lived in Scotland on the date they were last known to be alive, authorities can use this act to declare the person legally dead after the standard period of seven years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1977/27|title=Presumption of Death (Scotland) Act 1977|work=legislation.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] provides that all powers not expressly or implicitly assigned to the federal state are reserved to the 50 unitary states. The declaration of a missing person as legally dead thus falls under state jurisdiction unless there is a reason for the federal government to have jurisdiction (e.g. the party was military personnel who went missing while on active duty). Otherwise, there are 57 U.S. jurisdictions that comprise the United States, each of which has its own law on the question.

People who disappear are typically called ''missing'', or sometimes ''absent''. Several criteria are evaluated to determine whether a person may be declared legally dead:
* The party normally must have been missing from their home or usual residence for an extended period of time, most commonly seven years
* Their absence must have been continuous and inexplicable (e.g. the person did not say they had found a new job and were moving far away)
* There must have been no communication from the party with those people most likely to hear from them during the period the person has been missing
* There must have been a diligent but unsuccessful search for the person and/or diligent but unsuccessful [[inquiry]] into their whereabouts.

Professor Jeanne Carriere, in "The Rights of the Living Dead: Absent Persons in [[Civil law (legal system)|Civil Law]]" (published in the ''Louisiana Law Review''), stated that as of 1990, the number of such cases in the United States was estimated at between 60,000 and 100,000.&lt;ref name="carriere"&gt;"The rights of the living dead: absent persons in the civil law". Jeanne Carriere, 50 La. L. Rev. 901, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Often the missing person's bank accounts are checked for activity, and possible sightings investigated.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

According to Edgar Sentell, a retired senior [[vice-president]] and [[general counsel]] of Southern Farm Bureau Life Insurance Company, almost all states recognize the presumption of death, by [[statute]] or judicial recognition of the [[common law]] rule. Some states have amended their statutes to reduce the seven-year period to five consecutive years missing, and some, such as [[Minnesota]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], have reduced the period to four years.&lt;ref name=Sentell&gt;[http://www.thefederation.org/documents/Vol54No2.pdf "The missing insured and the life insurance death claim"]. C. Edgar Sentell, ''FDCC Quarterly'', Winter 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

If someone disappears, those interested can file a [[petition]] to have them declared legally dead. They must prove by the criteria above that the person is in fact dead. There are [[constitutional]] limitations to these procedures: The presumption must arise only after a reasonable amount of time has elapsed. The absent person must be notified. Courts permit notifying claimants by publication. Adequate [[safeguards]] concerning property provisions must be made in the case that an absent person shows up.

Some states require those who receive the missing person's assets to return them if the person turned out to be alive. If a person is declared dead when only missing, their estate is distributed as if they were dead. In some cases, the presumption of death can be rebutted. According to Sentell, courts will consider evidence that the absent person was a [[fugitive]] from [[justice]], had money troubles, had a bad relationship, or had no family ties or connection to a [[community]] as reasons not to presume death.&lt;ref name=Sentell /&gt;

A person can be declared legally dead after they are exposed to "imminent peril" and fail to return—as in a plane crash, as portrayed in the movie ''[[Cast Away]]''. In these cases courts generally assume the person was killed, even though the usual waiting time to declare someone dead has not elapsed. Sentell also says, "The element of peril accelerates the presumption of death." This rule was enacted after the [[September 11 attacks|attack on the World Trade Center]], so that authorities could release [[death certificates]]. Although people presumed dead sometimes turn up alive, it is not as common as it used to be. In one case where this occurred, a man named John Burney disappeared in 1976 while having financial problems, and later reappeared in December 1982. His company and wife had already received the death benefits—so, on returning, the [[life insurance]] company sued him, his wife, and his company. In the end, the court ruled Burney's actions fraudulent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/mlegallydead.html "What happens when someone 'legally dead' shows up alive?"] ''The Straight Dope'', 13 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reappearance==
{{See also|List of premature obituaries}}
Missing persons have on rare occasions been found alive after being declared legally dead (see below). [[Prisoners of war]], people with [[mental illness]]es who become [[homeless]], and in extremely rare circumstances [[kidnapping]] victims may be located years after their disappearance. Some people have even [[faked death|faked their deaths]] to avoid paying taxes, debts, etc.

A '''Delphinion''' (ancient Greek: Δελφίνιον) found in ancient Greece, was a temple of [[Apollo Delphinios]] ("Apollo of the womb") also known as "Delphic Apollo" or "Pythian Apollo", the principal god of [[Delphi]], who was regarded as the protector of ports and ships.

== The Delphinion at Miletus ==
The ruin of the Delphinion in [[Miletus]] is still mostly standing. A rectangular [[temenos]], the remains of the temple at the site date back to as early as the fifth century B.C.E.  Still present are a rectangular altar with volute [[Acroterion|acroteria]], as well as a few other round marble altars. An "annual Spring procession which went from Miletus to the Temple of Apollo at Didyma began at the Delphinion" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/artifact?name=Miletus,%20Delphinion&amp;object=Building|title=Miletus, Delphinion (Building)|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|access-date=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inscriptions found on the walls of the Delphinion tell us the site also served as the city archive.

== The Delphinion at Athens ==
The Delphinion in [[Athens]] near the [[Acropolis]] contained a court of law, which was used to try [[homicide]] cases where the accused had claimed the defence of [[justifiable homicide]].

An '''equitable right''' is a [[legal right]] guaranteed by [[Equity (law)|equity]] as opposed to a legal right which derives authority from a legal source. An example of an equitable right could be seen in [[Land law]], where mention is made of a beneficial interest i.e. vested interests in an estate which are protected by equity. In essence, a contributor to the purchase of a [[property]], has an equitable right to that property albeit not being the registered proprietor.

A number of organisations issue template format opinions to indicate issues which are intended to be covered by such opinions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.citysolicitors.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;id=162&amp;Itemid=471| title=Draft Foreign Legal Opinion on Transactions Relating to Property In England and Wales| publisher=City of London Law Society| accessdate=18 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or standard form checklists for contents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.practicallaw.com/5-238-3952 |title=Contents of a foreign legal opinion on security: checklist| publisher=Thompson Reuters (Practical Law)| accessdate=18 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==

The original purpose of foreign legal opinion is grounded in the historical doctrine of ''[[ultra vires]]''.  The concern was that when doing business with a [[corporation]] formed in a foreign country, proper due diligence required that a legal opinion be sought to ensure that the relevant foreign company had the necessary [[Capacity (law)#Business entities|capacity and power]] to enter into the transaction, and that it would be binding upon it.&lt;ref&gt;''Banco de Bilbao v Sancha''; ''Banco de Bilbao v Rey'' [1938] 2 KB 176, CA&lt;/ref&gt;  Over time opinions expanded to cover related aspects of foreign law, such as whether payments might be subject to [[Foreign exchange controls|exchange controls]] or [[Usury#Usury law|usury laws]], whether it was necessary for any of the other parties to hold any licences or permits under the [[Regulation|regulatory laws]] of the foreign country, whether there would be adverse [[tax]] consequences under the laws of the foreign country, whether foreign judgments were recognised and enforced in that country other collateral matters.

During the 1970s and 1980s with the expansions in cross-border lender by financial institutions, [[bank]]s became increasingly concerned to ensure that foreign companies to whom they lent money provided a foreign legal opinion certifying the legal validity of the [[loan agreement|loan transaction]] and the enforceability of the banks' rights (including any [[security interest]]s).&lt;ref name=gruson/&gt;  In time these requires came to be reflected in the [[Basel Accords|Basel capital adequacy requirements]] for banks, resulting in different, more favourable, capital weighting for loans supported by opinions.

==Format==

Foreign legal opinions are now highly standardised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=International Loans, Bonds, Guarantees, Legal Opinions |author=Philip R. Wood |url=https://books.google.vg/books?id=Lu3Hkc348loC&amp;pg=PT487&amp;lpg=PT487&amp;dq=foreign+legal+opinions&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MB--J7F85y&amp;sig=IUV2jlMhQps6a29eoZVpnU9Nzac&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cGXyU_GzLq3KsQSqhYHQDw&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=foreign%20legal%20opinions&amp;f=false |at=26-094|isbn=1847032087}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Typically such opinions will confirm the jurisdiction which they relate to, confirm the documents that they reviewed, list certain assumptions of fact, and then set out various opinion statements.  After the opinion statements, they will typically make certain standard, generally applicable qualifications.

The opinion will ordinarily state the conclusions of law, but will not provide reasoning.  This reflects the role of the foreign law opinion as a risk assessment tool.  The opinion is normally issued in the format of an unqualified favourable statement of the effectiveness of the transaction (hedged in by appropriate assumptions of fact and general qualifications of law).&lt;ref name=gruson/&gt;  Where there are areas of legal uncertainty, or issues which require clarification and analysis, the foreign legal opinion will often remain in the standardised format, but will be supplemented with a second, reasoned, opinion.  In cross border transactions the negotiation and discussion of the format of the foreign law opinions elucidates areas of legal stress or risk in relation to the proposed transaction and foreign legal systems.&lt;ref name=gruson/&gt;

Standard assumptions normally include assuming that documents and records reviewed by the law firm giving the opinion are accurate, that all copies they review are true copies, and that no provision of any other law (i.e. the laws of any country other than the country on whose laws the opinion is being given) adversely affects the opinion being expressed.  In certain countries it is also standard to assume the genuineness of signatures and [[company seal|seals]], but in other countries the foreign law firm may be expected to verify the accuracy of such signatures.

The substantive opinion statements a foreign legal opinion will make will ordinarily include:
# that the relevant obligations be recognised as constituting valid and binding obligations of the foreign party;
# which person or organ has power on behalf of the foreign entity to enter into the transaction;
# the proper method of execution of documents by the foreign party;
# that the transaction does not breach the constitutional documents of the foreign entity, or the laws of the foreign country (and, sometimes, any agreements which are binding upon the foreign entity and its assets);
# that no approvals or licences are required in the foreign country in relation to the transaction;
# that the transaction documents are not subject to stamp duty or registration requirements in the foreign country;
# that no withholding or other taxes apply to the transaction in the foreign country;
# that the foreign entity does not have [[sovereign immunity]] under the laws of the foreign country;
# that there are no exchange control regulations in the foreign country which would affect the transaction;
# that the foreign entity is in good standing, and is not subject to winding-up or dissolution;
# to what extent judgments or [[arbitral award]]s from another country would be recognised and enforced in the foreign country (without re-examination of the merits);
# the efficacy of [[choice of law clause]]s and [[jurisdiction clause]]s in the foreign jurisdiction;
# whether any terms of the transaction contravene [[public policy]] in the foreign country; and
# whether any of the other parties to the transaction (other than the foreign entity) would be treated as carrying on business or subject to tax in the foreign country by entering into the transaction.

Standard qualifications are usually matters of general law which it is impractical to advise upon in the abstract, but which might undermine the effectiveness of the enforceability of the transaction.  For example most opinions will indicate that if the foreign party goes into bankruptcy that will limit the ability to enforce obligations against it.  Similarly, rights may be lost when statutory [[limitation period]]s expire.  In certain countries enforcement of obligations may be subject to obligations of good faith and fair dealing, and the foreign legal opinion will normally point this out by way of qualification.

==Conflicts of laws==
The foreign legal opinion will typically express opinions on various issues which might not ordinarily be governed by the laws of the foreign country under its own [[conflict of laws]] system.  Because a cross border transaction might end up being considered by the courts of any of a number of countries, the addressee(s) of the opinion will wish to be assured that all relevant issues, if determined by that foreign law, would likely be resolved satisfactorily.  The courts of a third country may apply different choice of law rules to determine the ''[[lex causae]]'' of a particular issue to the courts of the foreign country.

The '''German Historical School of Jurisprudence''' is a 19th-century intellectual movement in the study of German law. With Romanticism as its background, it emphasized the historical limitations of the law. It stood in opposition to an earlier movement called ''Vernunftrecht'' (Rational Law).

==Overview==
The Historical School is based on the writings and teachings of [[Gustav von Hugo]] and especially [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny]]. [[Natural law]]yers held that law could be discovered only by rational deduction from the nature of man.

The basic premise of the German Historical School is that law is not to be regarded as an arbitrary grouping of regulations laid down by some authority. Rather, those regulations are to be seen as the expression of the convictions of the people, in the same manner as language, customs and practices are expressions of the people. The law is grounded in a form of popular consciousness called the ''[[Volksgeist]]''.

Laws can stem from regulations by the authorities, but more commonly they evolve in an organic manner over time without interference from the authorities. The ever-changing practical needs of the people play a very important role in this continual organic development.

In the development of a legal system, is it the professional duty of lawyers – in the sense of the division of labor in society – to base their academic work on law on ascertaining the will of the people. In this way, lawyers embody the popular will.

The German Historical School was divided into Romanists and the Germanists. The Romantists, to whom Savigny also belonged, held that the ''Volksgeist'' springs from the reception of the [[Roman law]]. While the Germanists ([[Karl Friedrich Eichhorn]], [[Jakob Grimm]], [[Georg Beseler]], [[Otto von Gierke]]) saw medieval German Law as the expression of the German ''Volksgeist''.

The German Historical School has had considerable influence on the academic study of law in Germany. [[Georg Friedrich Puchta]] and [[Bernhard Windscheid]] continued the Romanist vein founded by Savigny, leading to the so-called ''Pandektenwissenschaft'' which is seen as ''Begriffsjurisprudenz'' (conceptual jurisprudence).

== Criticism ==
[[Karl Marx]] devoted an 1842 essay "The philosophical manifesto of the historical school of law" to criticizing the historical school of law, calling it the "sole frivolous product" of the eighteenth century. 
{{quote|[[Gustav Hugo|Hugo]] misinterprets his teacher [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] by supposing that because we cannot know what is true, we consequently allow the untrue, if it exists at all, to pass as fully valid. He is a sceptic as regards the necessary essence of things, so as to be a courtier as regards their accidental appearance. ... Everything existing serves him as an authority, every authority serves him as an argument.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, “The philosophical manifesto of the historical school of law” (1842), ''Karl Marx Frederick Engels Collected Works'' (1975), vol. 2, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Refimprove|date=January 2009}}
'''''Homo sacer''''' (Latin for "the sacred man" or "the accursed man") is a figure of [[Roman law]]: a person who is [[ban (law)|banned]] and may be killed by anybody, but may not be [[human sacrifice|sacrificed]] in a religious ritual.&lt;ref&gt;Agamben, Giorgio. Heller-Roazen, trans. ''Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life'' Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1998. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The meaning of the term ''sacer'' in [[Ancient Roman religion]] is not fully congruent with the meaning it took after Christianization, and which was adopted into English as ''sacred''. In early Roman religion ''sacer'', much like the Hebrew [[:wikt:קדש|{{Hebrew|קָדוֹש}}]] ''qadoš'', denotes anything "set apart" from common society and encompasses both the sense of "hallowed" and that of "cursed". This concept of the sacred is more in line with the Islamic notion of ''[[haram]]''. The ''homo sacer'' could thus also simply mean a person expunged from society and deprived of all [[rights]] and all functions in [[civil religion]]. ''Homo sacer'' is defined in legal terms as someone who can be killed without the killer being regarded as a murderer; and a person who cannot be sacrificed.&lt;ref&gt;Giorgio Agamben - Homo Sacer, 1995 (Valdisholm publishing company, Norwegian translation), 2. part (Homo Sacer) 1.1.  citing [[Sextus Pompeius Festus]].&lt;/ref&gt; The sacred human may thus be understood as someone outside the law, or beyond it. With respect to certain monarchs, in certain western legal traditions, the concepts of the sovereign and of the Homo Sacer have been conflated.&lt;ref&gt;§ 5 Constitution of Norway -&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''sacred man'' could also have been used because the condemned could only rely on protection of gods.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.pl/books?id=3tTfzsdmbl4C&amp;pg=PA167&amp;lpg=PA167&amp;dq=prescription+homo+sacer&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3c-aTIegvb&amp;sig=v2CFrKQJ7oGUQfEZe_ysaSHyU80&amp;hl=pl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjIhZiL8YTcAhUmLsAKHTvHByYQ6AEIRjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=prescription%20homo%20sacer&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

The status of ''homo sacer'' could fall upon one as a consequence of oath-breaking. An [[oath]] in antiquity was essentially a conditional self-cursing, i.e. invoking one or several deities and asking for their punishment in the event of breaking the oath. An oathbreaker was consequently considered the property of the gods whom he had invoked and then deceived. If the oathbreaker was killed, this was understood as the revenge of the gods into whose power he had given himself. Since the oathbreaker was already the property of the oath deity, he could no longer belong to human society, or be consecrated to another deity.

A direct reference to this status is found in the [[Twelve Tables]] (8.21), laws of the early Roman Republic written in the 5th century BC. The paragraph states that a [[Patronage in ancient Rome|patron]] who deceives his clients is to be regarded as ''sacer''.

The idea of the status of an [[outlaw]], a criminal who is declared as unprotected by the law and can consequently be killed by anyone with impunity, persists throughout the [[Middle Ages]]. Medieval perception condemned the entire human intrinsic moral worth of the outlaw, dehumanizing the outlaw literally as a "wolf" or "wolf's-head" (in an era where hunting of wolves existed strongly, including a commercial element)&lt;ref&gt;Mary R. Gerstein, Berkeley, Ca., 1974, "Germanic Warg: The Outlaw as Werwolf", in G.J. Larson, ed., ''Myth in Indo-European Antiquity'', p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; and is first revoked only by the English ''[[Habeas Corpus]]'' act of 1679 which declares that any criminal must be judged by a tribunal before being punished.

Italian philosopher [[Giorgio Agamben]] takes the concept as the starting point of his main work ''[[Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life]]'' (1998).

[[File:CourtGavel.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Philosopher]]s of law ask "what is law, and what should it be?"]]

'''Jurisprudence''' or '''legal theory''' is the theoretical study of [[law]], principally by [[philosophy of law|philosophers]] but, from the twentieth century, also by [[social science|social scientists]]. Scholars of jurisprudence, also known as [[jurist]]s or legal theorists, hope to obtain a deeper understanding of [[Reason#Logical reasoning methods and argumentation|legal reasoning]], [[list of national legal systems|legal systems]], [[Law#Legal institutions|legal institutions]], and the role of law in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/jurisprudence|title=Jurisprudence|last=Staff|first=LII|date=2007-08-06|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern jurisprudence began in the 18th century and was focused on the first principles of the [[natural law]], [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], and the [[Public international law|law of nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Garner|first=Bryan A.|title=Black's law dictionary|year=2009|publisher=West|location=Saint Paul, Minnesota, USA|isbn=0-314-19949-7|pages=Jurisprudence entry|edition=9th}}&lt;/ref&gt; General jurisprudence can be divided into categories both by the type of question scholars seek to answer and by the theories of jurisprudence, or schools of thought, regarding how those questions are best answered. Contemporary philosophy of law, which deals with general jurisprudence, addresses problems internal to law and legal systems, and problems of law as a particular social institution as law relates to the larger political and social situation in which it exists.&lt;ref name="Shiner"&gt;Shiner, "Philosophy of Law", ''Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt;

This article distinguishes three distinct branches of thought in general jurisprudence. To begin with, ancient [[#Natural law|natural law]], as a major branch and theory of jurisprudence, is the idea that there are rational objective limits to the power of legislative rulers. The foundations of law are accessible through reason and it is from these laws of nature that human-created laws gain whatever force they have.&lt;ref name="Shiner" /&gt; Secondly, 'clarificatory' or [[#Analytic jurisprudence|analytic jurisprudence]] rejects natural law's fusing of what law is and what it ought to be. It espouses the use of a neutral point of view and descriptive language when referring to aspects of legal systems.&lt;ref name="Hart_1958"/&gt; It comprises different theories of jurisprudence. For example, ''legal positivism'', holds that there is no necessary connection between law and morality and that the force of law comes from some basic social facts.&lt;ref name="Soper_CDoP"&gt;Soper, "Legal Positivism", ''Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt; And ''legal realism'' argues that the real world practice of law is what determines what law is; the law has the force that it does because of what legislators, lawyers and judges do with it. Thirdly, [[#Normative jurisprudence|normative jurisprudence]] is concerned with "evaluative" theories of law. It deals with what the goal or purpose of law is, or what moral or political theories provide a foundation for the law. Besides the question "What is law?", it tries to answer what the proper function of law was, or what sorts of acts should be subject to legal sanctions, and what sorts of punishment should be permitted.

== Etymology ==
The English word is based on the Latin maxim ''jurisprudentia'': ''juris'' is the [[genitive]] form of ''jus'' meaning "law", and ''prudentia'' means "prudence" (also: discretion, foresight, forethought, circumspection; refers to the exercise of good judgment, common sense, and even caution, especially in the conduct of practical matters). The word is first attested in English in 1628,&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]], 2nd edition 1989&lt;/ref&gt; at a time when the word ''prudence'' had the meaning of "knowledge of or skill in a matter". The word may have come via the French ''jurisprudence'', which is attested earlier.

== History ==
Ancient Indian jurisprudence is available in various [[Dharmaśāstra]] texts starting from the Dharmasutra of Bhodhayana.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bhu.ac.in/mmak/resent_article/JusticeKatjusLec.pdf|title=ANCIENT INDIAN JURISPRUDENCE|first=Markandey|last=Katju|year=2010|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jurisprudence already had this meaning{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} in [[Ancient Rome]] even if at its origins the discipline was a (''periti'') in the ''[[Ius|jus]]'' of ''[[mos maiorum]]'' (traditional law), a body of [[oral law]]s and customs verbally transmitted "by father to son". Praetors established a workable body of laws by judging whether or not singular cases were capable of being prosecuted either by the edicta, the annual pronunciation of prosecutable offense, or in extraordinary situations, additions made to the edicta. An iudex then would judge a remedy according to the facts of the case.

Their sentences were supposed to be simple interpretations of the traditional customs, but effectively it was an activity that, apart from formally reconsidering for each case what precisely was traditionally in the legal habits, soon turned also to a more equitable interpretation, coherently adapting the law to the newer social instances. The law was then implemented with new evolutive ''Institutiones'' (legal concepts), while remaining in the traditional scheme. Praetors were replaced in the 3rd century BC by a laical body of ''prudentes''. Admission to this body was conditional upon proof of competence or experience.

Under the [[Roman Empire]], schools of law were created, and the activity constantly became more academic. In the age from the early Roman Empire to the 3rd century, a relevant literature was produced by some notable groups including the Proculians and [[Sabinians]]. The scientific depth of the studies was unprecedented in ancient times.

After the 3rd century, ''Juris prudentia'' became a more bureaucratic activity, with few notable authors. It was during the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] (5th century) that legal studies were once again undertaken in depth, and it is from this cultural movement that [[Justinian I|Justinian]]'s [[Corpus Juris Civilis]] was born.

=={{Anchor|Natural law}}Natural law==
In its general context, natural law theory may be compared to both state-of-nature law and general law understood on the basis of an analogy to the physical laws of science. Natural law is often contrasted to positive law which asserts law as the product of human activity and human volition.

Another approach to natural law jurisprudence generally asserts that human law may be supported by decisive reasons for action. In other words, there must be a compelling rationale behind following human law. There are two readings of the natural law jurisprudential stance.
# '''The Strong Natural Law Thesis''' holds that if a human law fails to be backed-up by decisive reasons, then it is not properly called a "law" at all. This is captured, imperfectly, in the famous maxim: ''[[Lex iniusta non est lex|lex iniusta non est lex']] (an unjust law is no law at all).'' 
# '''The Weak Natural Law Thesis''' holds that if a human law fails to be backed-up by decisive reasons, then it can still be called a "law", but it must be recognised as a defective law. 
Notions of an objective moral order, external to human legal systems, underlie natural law. What is right or wrong can vary according to the interests one is focused upon. Natural law is sometimes identified with the maxim that "an unjust law is no law at all", but as [[John Finnis]], the most important of modern natural barristers{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} has argued, this maxim is a poor guide to the classical [[Thomism|Thomist]] position. Strongly related to theories of natural law are classical theories of [[justice]], beginning in the West with [[Plato]]'s [[Plato Republic|Republic]].

===Aristotle===
[[File:Francesco Hayez 001.jpg|thumb|[[Aristotle]], by [[Francesco Hayez]]]]
Aristotle is often said to be the father of natural law.&lt;ref&gt;Shellens, "Aristotle on Natural Law."&lt;/ref&gt; Like his philosophical forefathers [[Socrates]] and Plato, Aristotle posited the existence of [[natural justice]] or natural right (''dikaion physikon'', ''δικαίον φυσικόν'', [[Latin]] ''[[ius naturale]]''). His association with natural law is largely due to the way in which he was interpreted by [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref&gt;Jaffa, ''Thomism and Aristotelianism''.&lt;/ref&gt; This was based on Aquinas' conflation of natural law and natural right, the latter of which Aristotle posits in Book V of the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' (= Book IV of the ''[[Eudemian Ethics]]''). Aquinas's influence was such as to affect a number of early translations of these passages,&lt;ref&gt;H. Rackham, trans., ''Nicomachean Ethics'', Loeb Classical Library; J. A. K. Thomson, trans. (revised by Hugh Tedennick), ''Nicomachean Ethics'', Penguin Classics.&lt;/ref&gt; though more recent translations render them more literally.&lt;ref&gt;Joe Sachs, trans., ''Nicomachean Ethics'', Focus Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle's theory of justice is bound up in his idea of the [[golden mean (philosophy)|golden mean]]. Indeed, his treatment of what he calls "political justice" derives from his discussion of "the just" as a moral virtue derived as the mean between opposing vices, just like every other virtue he describes.&lt;ref&gt;"Nicomachean Ethics" Bk. II ch. 6&lt;/ref&gt; His longest discussion of his theory of justice occurs in ''Nicomachean Ethics'' and begins by asking what sort of mean a just act is. He argues that the term "justice" actually refers to two different but related ideas: general justice and particular justice.&lt;ref&gt;Terrence Irwin, trans. ''Nicomachean Ethics, 2nd Ed.'', Hackett Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Nicomachean Ethics'', Bk. V, ch. 3&lt;/ref&gt; When a person's actions are completely virtuous in all matters in relation to others, Aristotle calls them "just" in the sense of "general justice;" as such this idea of justice is more or less coextensive with virtue.&lt;ref&gt;"Nicomachean Ethics", Bk. V, ch. 1&lt;/ref&gt; "Particular" or "partial justice", by contrast, is the part of "general justice" or the individual virtue that is concerned with treating others equitably.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Aristotle moves from this unqualified discussion of justice to a qualified view of political justice, by which he means something close to the subject of modern jurisprudence. Of political justice, Aristotle argues that it is partly derived from nature and partly a matter of convention.&lt;ref&gt;''Nicomachean Ethics'', Bk. V, ch. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be taken as a statement that is similar to the views of modern natural law theorists. But it must also be remembered that Aristotle is describing a view of morality, not a system of law, and therefore his remarks as to nature are about the grounding of the morality enacted as law, not the laws themselves. The passage here is silent as to that question.

The best evidence of Aristotle's having thought there was a natural law comes from the ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]'', where Aristotle notes that, aside from the "particular" laws that each people has set up for itself, there is a "common" law that is according to nature.&lt;ref&gt;''Rhetoric'' 1373b2–8.&lt;/ref&gt; The context of this remark, however, suggests only that Aristotle thought that it could be rhetorically advantageous to appeal to such a law, especially when the "particular" law of one's own city was adverse to the case being made, not that there actually was such a law;&lt;ref&gt;Shellens, "Aristotle on Natural Law," 75–81&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle, moreover, considered two of the three candidates for a universally valid, natural law suggested in this passage to be wrong.&lt;ref&gt;"Natural Law," ''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences''.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle's theoretical paternity of the natural law tradition is consequently disputed.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

===Thomas Aquinas===
[[File:St-thomas-aquinas.jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Aquinas]] was the most influential Western medieval legal [[scholar]]]]
{{Main|Thomas Aquinas}}
Thomas Aquinas, [Thomas of Aquin, or Aquino] (c. 1225 – 7 March 1274) was an Italian philosopher and theologian in the [[scholasticism|scholastic]] tradition, known as "Doctor Angelicus, Doctor Universalis". He is the foremost classical proponent of [[natural theology]], and the father of the Thomistic school of philosophy, for a long time the primary philosophical approach of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. The work for which he is best known is the ''[[Summa Theologica]]''. One of the thirty-five [[Doctor of the Church|Doctors of the Church]], he is considered by many Catholics to be the Church's greatest theologian. Consequently, many [[Institutions named after Thomas Aquinas|institutions of learning]] have been named after him.

Aquinas distinguished four kinds of law: eternal, natural, human and divine:

* Eternal law refers to divine reason, known only to God. It is God's plan for the universe. Man needs this, for without it he would totally lack direction.
* Natural law is the "participation" in the eternal law by rational human creatures, and is discovered by reason.
* [[Divine law]] is revealed in the scriptures and is God's positive law for mankind.
* [[Human law]] is supported by reason and enacted for the common good.&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Pojman]], ''Ethics'' ([[Belmont, California|Belmont]], [[California|CA]]: Wadsworth Publishing Company, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural law, of course, is based on "first principles":

&lt;blockquote&gt;''...&amp;nbsp;this is the first precept of the law, that good is to be done and promoted, and evil is to be avoided. All other precepts of the natural law are based on this&amp;nbsp;...''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/a/aquinas/summa/FS/FS094.html#FSQ94A2THEP1|title=Summa Theologica|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The desires to live and to procreate are counted by Aquinas among those basic (natural) human values on which all other human values are based.

===School of Salamanca===
{{Main|School of Salamanca|ius gentium}}
[[Francisco de Vitoria]] was perhaps the first to develop a theory of ''[[ius gentium]]'' (the rights of peoples), and thus is an important figure in the transition to modernity. He extrapolated his ideas of legitimate sovereign power to society at the international level, concluding that this scope as well ought to be ruled by just forms respectable of the rights of all. The common good of the world is of a category superior to the good of each state. This meant that relations between states ought to pass from being justified by force to being justified by law and justice. Some scholars have upset the standard account of the origins of International law, which emphasises the seminal text ''De iure belli ac pacis'' by Grotius, and argued for Vitoria and, later, Suárez's importance as forerunners and, potentially, founders of the field.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. James Brown Scott, cited in Cavallar, The Rights of Strangers: theories of international hospitality, the global community, and political justice since Vitoria, p.164&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as Koskenniemi, have argued that none of these humanist and scholastic thinkers can be understood to have founded international law in the modern sense, instead placing its origins in the post-1870 period.&lt;ref&gt;Koskenniemi: International Law and raison d'état: Rethinking the Prehistory of International Law in Kingsbury &amp; Strausmann, The Roman Foundations of the Law of Nations, p. 297–339&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Francisco Suárez]], regarded as among the greatest scholastics after Aquinas, subdivided the concept of ''ius gentium''. Working with already well-formed categories, he carefully distinguished ''ius inter gentes'' from ''ius intra gentes''. ''Ius inter gentes'' (which corresponds to modern international law) was something common to the majority of countries, although, being positive law, not natural law, was not necessarily universal. On the other hand, ''ius intra gentes'', or civil law, is specific to each nation.

===Thomas Hobbes===
{{Main|Thomas Hobbes}}
In his treatise ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan, (1651)]]'', Hobbes expresses a view of natural law as a [[precept]], or general rule, found out by [[reason]], by which a man is forbidden to do that which is destructive of his life, or takes away the means of preserving the same; and to omit that by which he thinks it may best be preserved. Hobbes was a [[social contract]]arian&lt;ref&gt;Basically meaning: the people of a society are prepared give up some rights to a government in order to receive social order.&lt;/ref&gt; and believed that the law gained peoples' tacit consent. He believed that society was formed from a [[state of nature]] to protect people from the state of war between mankind that exists otherwise. Life is, without an ordered society, "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short". It is commonly commented that Hobbes' views about the core of human nature were influenced by his times. The [[English Civil War]] and the Cromwellian dictatorship had taken place, and he felt absolute authority vested in a monarch, whose subjects obeyed the law, was the basis of a civilized society.

===Lon Fuller===
{{Main|Lon L. Fuller}}
Writing after [[World War II]], Lon L. Fuller defended a secular and procedural form of natural law. He notably emphasised that the (natural) law must meet certain formal requirements (such as being impartial and publicly knowable). To the extent that an institutional system of social control falls short of these requirements, Fuller argues, we are less inclined to recognise it as a system of law, or to give it our respect. Thus, law has an internal morality that goes beyond the social rules by which valid laws are made.

===John Finnis===
{{Main|John Finnis}}
Sophisticated positivist and natural law theories sometimes resemble each other more than the above descriptions might suggest, and they may concede certain points to the other "side". Identifying a particular theorist as a positivist or a natural law theorist sometimes involves matters of emphasis and degree, and the particular influences on the theorist's work. In particular, the older natural lawyers, such as Aquinas and John Locke made no distinction between analytic and normative jurisprudence. But modern natural lawyers, such as John Finnis claim to be positivists, while still arguing that law is a basically moral creature. His book ''[[Natural Law and Natural Rights]]'' (1980, 2011) is a restatement of natural law doctrine.

=={{Anchor|Analytic jurisprudence}}Analytic jurisprudence==
{{Main|Analytic jurisprudence}}

Analytic, or 'clarificatory', jurisprudence means the use of a neutral point of view and descriptive language when referring to the aspects of legal systems. This was a philosophical development that rejected natural law's fusing of what law is and what it ought to be.&lt;ref name="Hart_1958"&gt;See H L A Hart, 'Positivism and the Separation of Law and Morals' (1958) 71 ''Harv. L. Rev.'' 593&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Hume]] famously argued in ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]''&lt;ref&gt;David Hume, ''A Treatise of Human Nature'' (1739) [http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/h/hume/david/h92t/ Etext] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820100015/http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/h/hume/david/h92t/ |date=20 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that people invariably slip between describing that the world ''is'' a certain way to saying therefore we ''ought'' to conclude on a particular course of action. But as a matter of pure logic, one cannot conclude that we ''ought'' to do something merely because something ''is'' the case. So analysing and clarifying the way the world ''is'' must be treated as a strictly separate question to normative and evaluative ''ought'' questions.

The most important questions of analytic jurisprudence are: "What are laws?"; "What is ''the'' law?"; "What is the relationship between law and power/sociology?"; and "What is the relationship between law and morality?" Legal positivism is the dominant theory, although there are a growing number of critics who offer their own interpretations.

===Historical School===
Historical jurisprudence came to prominence during the German debate over the proposed codification of German law. In his book ''On the Vocation of Our Age for Legislation and Jurisprudence'',&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Carl von Savigny, ''On the Vocation of Our Age for Legislation and Jurisprudence'' (Abraham A. Hayward trans., 1831)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny]] argued that Germany did not have a legal language that would support codification because the traditions, customs and beliefs of the German people did not include a belief in a code. The Historicists believe that the law originates with society.

===Sociological Jurisprudence===
{{Main|Sociology of Law}}
The effort to inform jurisprudence systematically with sociological insights developed strongly from the beginning of the twentieth century, as sociology began to establish itself as a distinct social science, especially in the United States and in continental Europe. In Germany the work of the 'free law' theorists (e.g. Ernst Fuchs, [[Hermann Kantorowicz]] and [[Eugen Ehrlich]]) encouraged the use of sociological insights in judicial development of law and juristic theory. The most internationally influential advocacy of a 'sociological jurisprudence' occurred in the United States, where [[Roscoe Pound]], for many years the Dean of Harvard Law School, used this term to characterise his legal philosophy throughout the first half of the twentieth century. In the United States many later writers followed Pound's lead or developed distinctive approaches to sociological jurisprudence. In Australia, [[Julius Stone]] strongly defended and developed Pound's ideas.  In the 1930s a significant split between the sociological jurists and the American legal realists emerged. In the second half of the twentieth century sociological jurisprudence as a distinct movement declined as jurisprudence came more strongly under the influence of analytical legal philosophy but with increasing criticism of dominant orientations of Anglophone legal philosophy in the present century it has attracted renewed interest.

===Legal positivism===
{{Main|Legal positivism}}
Positivism simply means that law is something that is "posited": laws are validly made in accordance with socially accepted rules. The positivist view on law can be seen to cover two broad principles: Firstly, that laws may seek to enforce justice, morality, or any other normative end, but their success or failure in doing so does not determine their validity. Provided a law is properly formed, in accordance with the rules recognized in the society concerned, it is a valid law, regardless of whether it is ''just'' by some other standard. Secondly, that law is nothing more than a set of rules to provide order and governance of society. No legal positivist, however, argues that it follows that the law is therefore to be obeyed, no matter what. This is seen as a separate question entirely.
* What the law ''is'' ([[lex lata]]) - is determined by historical social practice (resulting in rules)
* What the law ''ought to be'' ([[lex ferenda]]) - is determined by moral considerations.

====Bentham and Austin====
[[File:Jeremy Bentham by Henry William Pickersgill detail.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham's]] utilitarian theories remained dominant in law until the twentieth century]]
{{Main|Jeremy Bentham|John Austin (legal philosopher)}}
One of the earliest legal positivists was Jeremy Bentham. Bentham was an early and staunch supporter of the utilitarian concept (along with Hume), an avid prison reformer, advocate for [[democracy]], and strong [[atheist]]. Bentham's views about law and jurisprudence were popularized by his student, [[John Austin (legal philosopher)|John Austin]]. Austin was the first chair of law at the new [[University of London]] from 1829. Austin's [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] answer to "what is law?" was that law is "commands, backed by threat of sanctions, from a sovereign, to whom people have a habit of obedience".&lt;ref&gt;John Austin, ''The Providence of Jurisprudence Determined'' (1831)&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary legal positivists have long abandoned this view, and have criticised its oversimplification, H. L. A. Hart particularly.

====Hans Kelsen====
{{Main|Hans Kelsen}}
Hans Kelsen is considered one of the prominent jurists of the 20th century and has been highly influential in Europe and Latin America, although less so in common-law countries. His [[Pure Theory of Law]] aims to describe law as binding norms while at the same time refusing, itself, to evaluate those norms. That is, 'legal science' is to be separated from 'legal politics'. Central to the Pure Theory of Law is the notion of a 'basic norm ([[Grundnorm]])'—a hypothetical norm, presupposed by the jurist, from which in a hierarchy all 'lower' norms in a [[legal system]], beginning with [[constitutional law]], are understood to derive their authority or 'bindingness'. In this way, Kelsen contends, the bindingness of legal norms, their specifically 'legal' character, can be understood without tracing it ultimately to some suprahuman source such as God, personified Nature or—of great importance in his time—a personified State or Nation.

====H. L. A. Hart====
{{Main|H. L. A. Hart}}
In the Anglophone world, the pivotal writer was [[H. L. A. Hart]], who argued that the law should be understood as a system of social rules. Hart rejected Kelsen's views that sanctions were essential to law and that a normative social phenomenon, like law, can not be grounded in non-normative social facts. Hart revived analytical jurisprudence as an important theoretical debate in the twentieth century through his book ''[[The Concept of Law]]''.&lt;ref&gt;H. L. A. Hart, ''The Concept of Law'' (1961) Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-876122-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the professor of jurisprudence at [[Oxford University]], Hart argued that law is a 'system of rules'.

Rules, said Hart, are divided into primary rules (rules of conduct) and secondary rules (rules addressed to officials to administer primary rules). Secondary rules are divided into rules of adjudication (to resolve legal disputes), rules of change (allowing laws to be varied) and the rule of recognition (allowing laws to be identified as valid). The "rule of recognition" is a customary practice of the officials (especially barristers and judges) that identifies certain acts and decisions as sources of law. A pivotal book on Hart was written by Neil MacCormick&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.law.ed.ac.uk/staff/neilmaccormick_51.aspx |title=The University of Edinburgh |access-date=24 May 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060601221401/http://www.law.ed.ac.uk/staff/neilmaccormick_51.aspx |archive-date=1 June 2006 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1981 (second edition due in 2007), which further refined and offered some important criticisms that led MacCormick to develop his own theory (the best example of which is his recently published ''Institutions of Law'', 2007). Other important critiques have included that of Ronald Dworkin, John Finnis, and [[Joseph Raz]].

In recent years, debates about the nature of law have become increasingly fine-grained. One important debate is within legal positivism. One school is sometimes called ''exclusive legal positivism'', and it is associated with the view that the legal validity of a norm can never depend on its moral correctness. A second school is labeled ''inclusive legal positivism'', a major proponent of which is Wil Waluchow, and it is associated with the view that moral considerations ''may'' determine the legal validity of a norm, but that it is not necessary that this is the case.

====Joseph Raz====
{{Main|Joseph Raz}}
Some philosophers used to contend that positivism was the theory that there is "no necessary connection" between law and morality; but influential contemporary positivists, including Joseph Raz, John Gardner, and Leslie Green, reject that view. As Raz points out, it is a necessary truth that there are vices that a legal system cannot possibly have (for example, it cannot commit rape or murder).

Joseph Raz defends the positivist outlook, but criticised Hart's "soft social thesis" approach in ''The Authority of Law''.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Raz, ''The Authority of Law'' (1979) Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Raz argues that law is authority, identifiable purely through social sources, without reference to moral reasoning. Any categorisation of rules beyond their role as authority is better left to sociology than to jurisprudence.&lt;ref&gt;ch. 2, Joseph Raz, ''The Authority of Law'' (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal realism===
[[File:Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr circa 1930-edit.jpg|right|thumb|[[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] was a self-styled legal realist]]
{{Main|Legal realism}}
Legal realism was a view popular with some Scandinavian and American writers. Skeptical in tone, it held that the law should be understood and determined by the actual practices of courts, law offices, and police stations, rather than as the rules and doctrines set forth in statutes or learned treatises. It had some affinities with the sociology of law and sociological jurisprudence. The essential tenet of legal realism is that all law is made by human beings and, thus, is subject to human foibles, frailties and imperfections.

It has become common today to identify Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., as the main precursor of American Legal Realism (other influences include [[Roscoe Pound]], [[Karl N. Llewellyn|Karl Llewellyn]] and Justice [[Benjamin N. Cardozo|Benjamin Cardozo]]). Karl Llewellyn, another founder of the U.S. legal realism movement, similarly believed that the law is little more than putty in the hands of judges who are able to shape the outcome of cases based on their personal values or policy choices.&lt;ref&gt;"Jurisprudence". West's Encyclopedia of American Law. Ed. Jeffrey Lehman, Shirelle
Phelps. Detroit: Thomson/Gale, 2005.
&lt;/ref&gt; The chief inspiration for Scandinavian legal realism many consider to be the works of [[Axel Hägerström]].

Despite its decline in popularity, realism continues to influence a wide spectrum of jurisprudential schools today, including [[critical legal studies]], [[feminist legal theory]], [[critical race theory]], [[sociology of law]] and [[law and economics]].&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"&gt;[[Kristoffel Grechenig]] &amp; Martin Gelter, The Transatlantic Divergence in Legal Thought: American Law and Economics vs. German Doctrinalism, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1161168 ''Hastings International and Comparative Law Review 2008, vol. 31, p. 295–360''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Critical legal studies====
[[Critical legal studies]] are a younger theory of jurisprudence that has developed since the 1970s. It can be generally traced to American legal realism and is considered "the first movement in legal theory and legal scholarship in the United States to have espoused a committed Left political stance and perspective".&lt;ref name = Hunt86&gt;Alan Hunt, "The Theory of Critical Legal Studies," Oxford Journal of Legal Studies, Vol. 6, No. 1 (1986): 1-45, esp. 1, 5. See [http://ojls.oxfordjournals.org/content/6/1/1.extract]. DOI, 10.1093/ojls/6.1.1.&lt;/ref&gt; It holds that the law is largely contradictory, and can be best analyzed as an expression of the policy goals of a dominant social group.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, "Critical Legal Studies", ''Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical rationalism===
[[Karl Popper]] originated the theory of [[Jurisprudence#critical rationalism|critical rationalism]]. According to [[Reinhold Zippelius]] many advances in law and jurisprudence take place by operations of critical rationalism. He writes, "daß die Suche nach dem Begriff des Rechts, nach seinen Bezügen zur Wirklichkeit und nach der Gerechtigkeit experimentierend voranschreitet, indem wir Problemlösungen versuchsweise entwerfen, überprüfen und verbessern" (that we empirically search solutions of problems, which harmonise fair with the reality: by projecting, testing and improving the solutions).&lt;ref&gt;Reinhold Zippelius, Rechtsphilosophie, 6. Aufl. 2011 Vorwort.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal interpretivism===
{{Main|Interpretivism (legal)}}

Contemporary philosopher of law [[Ronald Dworkin]] has advocated a more constructivist theory of jurisprudence that can be characterized as a middle path between natural law theories and positivist theories of general jurisprudence.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, "Review of Dworkin and His Critics with Replies by Dworkin", ''Modern Law Review'', vol. 69 no. 6&lt;/ref&gt; 
In his book ''[[Law's Empire]]''&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Dworkin, ''Law's Empire'' (1986) [[Harvard University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; Dworkin attacked [[H. L. A. Hart|Hart]] and the positivists for their refusal to treat law as a moral issue. He argues that law is an 'interpretive' concept, that requires barristers to find the best-fitting and most just solution to a legal dispute, given their constitutional traditions. According to him, law is not entirely based on social facts, but includes the morally best justification for the institutional facts and practices that we intuitively regard as legal. It follows on Dworkin's view that one cannot know whether a society has a legal system in force, or what any of its laws are, until one knows some moral truths about the justifications for the practices in that society. It is consistent with Dworkin's view—in contrast with the views of legal positivists or legal realists—that ''no-one'' in a society may know what its laws are, because no-one may know the best justification for its practices.

Interpretation, according to Dworkin's ''integrity theory of law'', has two dimensions. To count as an interpretation, the reading of a text must meet the criterion of ''fit''. Of those interpretations that fit, however, Dworkin maintains that the correct interpretation is the one that puts the political practices of the community in their best light, or makes of them ''the best that they can be''. But many writers have doubted whether there ''is'' a single best justification for the complex practices of any given community, and others have doubted whether, even if there are, they should be counted as part of the law of that community.

===Therapeutic jurisprudence===
{{Main|Therapeutic jurisprudence}}

Consequences from the operation of legal rules or legal procedures—or from the behavior of legal actors (such as lawyers and judges)—may be either beneficial (therapeutic) or harmful (anti-therapeutic) to people. [[Therapeutic jurisprudence]] ("TJ") studies law as a social force (or agent) and uses [[social science]] methods and data to study the extent to which a legal rule or practice affects the psychological well-being of the people it affects.&lt;ref&gt;David B Wexler, Michael L Perlin, Michel Vols et al. 'Editorial: Current Issues in Therapeutic Jurisprudence' (2016) 16(3) ''QUT Law Review'' pp. 1-3. ISSN: Online- 2201-7275 https://lr.law.qut.edu.au/article/view/692/616&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{Anchor|Normative jurisprudence}}Normative jurisprudence==
{{Main|Political philosophy}}

In addition to the question, "What is law?", legal philosophy is also concerned with normative, or "evaluative" theories of law. What is the goal or purpose of law? What moral or political theories provide a foundation for the law? What is the proper function of law? What sorts of acts should be subject to [[sanctions (law)|punishment]], and what sorts of punishment should be permitted? What is justice? What rights do we have? Is there a duty to obey the law? What value has the rule of law? Some of the different schools and leading thinkers are as follows.

===Virtue jurisprudence===
[[File:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Plato]] (left) and [[Aristotle]] (right), a detail of ''[[The School of Athens]]'']]
{{Main|Virtue jurisprudence}}
Aretaic moral theories such as contemporary [[virtue ethics]] emphasize the role of character in morality. Virtue jurisprudence is the view that the laws should promote the development of virtuous characters by citizens. Historically, this approach is associated mainly with Aristotle or Thomas Aquinas later. Contemporary virtue jurisprudence is inspired by philosophical work on virtue ethics.

===Deontology===
{{Main|Deontological ethics}}
Deontology is "the theory of duty or moral obligation."&lt;ref&gt;Webster's New World Dictionary of the American Language, p. 378 (2d Coll. Ed. 1978).&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] formulated one influential deontological theory of law. He argued that any rule we follow must be able to be universally applied, i.e. we must be willing for everyone to follow that rule. A contemporary deontological approach can be found in the work of the legal philosopher Ronald Dworkin.

===Utilitarianism===
[[File:JohnStuartMill.JPG|thumb|200px|right|[[John Stuart Mill|Mill]] believed law should create happiness]]
{{Main|Utilitarianism}}
{{See also|Lysander Spooner}}
Utilitarianism is the view that the laws should be crafted so as to produce the best consequences for the greatest number of people possible. Historically, utilitarian thinking about law is associated with the philosopher Jeremy Bentham. John Stuart Mill was a pupil of Bentham's and was the torch bearer for [[Utilitarianism (book)|utilitarian]] philosophy through the late nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;see, [http://metalibri.incubadora.fapesp.br/portal/authors/m/john-stuart-mill/utilitarianism/ Utilitarianism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070505231025/http://metalibri.incubadora.fapesp.br/portal/authors/m/john-stuart-mill/utilitarianism/ |date=5 May 2007 }} at Metalibri Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; In contemporary legal theory, the utilitarian approach is frequently championed by scholars who work in the law and economics tradition.&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"/&gt;

===John Rawls===
{{Main|John Rawls|A Theory of Justice}}
John Rawls was an [[United States|American]] philosopher, a [[professor]] of [[political philosophy]] at [[Harvard University]] and author of ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' (1971), ''[[Political Liberalism]]'', ''[[Justice as Fairness: A Restatement]]'', and ''[[The Law of Peoples]]''. He is widely considered one of the most important English-language political philosophers of the 20th century. His theory of justice uses a device called the original position to ask us which principles of justice we would choose to regulate the basic institutions of our society if we were behind a 'veil of ignorance.' Imagine we do not know who we are - our race, sex, wealth status, class, or any distinguishing feature - so that we would not be biased in our own favour. Rawls argues from this 'original position' that we would choose exactly the same political liberties for everyone, like freedom of speech, the right to vote and so on. Also, we would choose a system where there is only inequality because that produces incentives enough for the economic well-being of all society, especially the poorest. This is Rawls's famous 'difference principle'. Justice is fairness, in the sense that the fairness of the original position of choice guarantees the fairness of the principles chosen in that position.

There are many other normative approaches to the philosophy of law, including critical legal studies and [[libertarian theories of law]].

'''Kelemedi Rakuve Bulewa''' {{IPA-fj|ke le me ndi mbu le wa|}} (May 16, 1951 – 2004)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Daurewa|first1=Alisi Waqanika|title=Is there truth in Fijian history?|url=http://vutikalulu.blogspot.co.nz/|website=Vutikalulu|accessdate=30 October 2015|date=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Fiji]]an lawyer and former politician, who served as [[Attorney General of Fiji]] from 1992 to 1996. 

Bulewa was known for his strongly pro-[[Fijians|ethnic Fijian]] views and was often associated with the nationalist [[Taukei movement]] that was supportive of the [[1987 Fijian coups d'état|1987 coups]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lal|first1=Brij V.|title=In the Eye of the Storm: Jai Ram Reddy and the Politics of Postcolonial Fiji|url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=tzqfQ6Q2rwUC&amp;pg=PA573&amp;lpg=PA573&amp;dq=%22Kelemedi+Bulewa%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0UqJK-WIE4&amp;sig=HHq6YhPN0JG9xR00-H5jjcna71s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwB2oVChMI7uDf4prqyAIVhJ2UCh0T3g8z#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Kelemedi%20Bulewa%22&amp;f=false|website=Google Books|publisher=ANU E Press, 2010|accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bulewa was elected to the [[House of Representatives of Fiji|House of Representatives]] in the [[Fijian general election, 1992|1992 election]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Members of the House of Representatives|url=http://www.appf.org.pe/countries/fiji/houser/members.htm|website=House of Representatives Members|accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first post-coup election, and was appointed Attorney General later that year upon the resignation of [[Apaitia Seru]].

Bulewa disagreed with, and attempted to change, laws dating from [[Colony of Fiji|colonial times]], that repressed the practice of the pre-Christian Fijian religion, saying that while he was not advocating it, he believed that freedom to practice it should be allowed for. Although most [[Fijians]] were now Christians, he said, many had only reluctantly abandoned worship of their ancestral gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Newson|first1=Leanne|last2=Aldous|first2=Jules|title=The Legal Maze: VCE Units 1 &amp; 2|url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=C6PN-8VcYcAC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;dq=%22Kelemedi+Bulewa%22+%2B+%22died%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6L_dMU7W-0&amp;sig=GP3PHKL0zF5b0SPrkL1R_OudLpg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwA2oVChMIgdz4spvqyAIVwrqUCh3FcAwz#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Kelemedi%20Bulewa%22%20%2B%20%22died%22&amp;f=false|website=The Legal Maze: VCE Units 1 &amp; 2|publisher=Macmillan Education AU, 2005|accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bulewa was supportive of calls for the dependency of [[Rotuma]] to be given self-government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Enasio|first1=Henry|title=Fiji's new constitution|url=http://www.rotuma.net/os/Forum/Enasio_Fiji's_Constitution.pdf|publisher=www.rotuma.net|accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Law''' is a [[system]] of rules that are created and [[law enforcement|enforced through social or governmental institutions]] to regulate [[behavior]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Robertson, ''Crimes against humanity'', 90.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been defined both as  "the [[soft science|Science]] of Justice" and "the [[the arts|Art]] of Justice".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/basharubin/2015/01/13/is-law-an-art-or-a-science-a-bit-of-both/ | title=Is Law an Art or a Science?: A Bit of Both}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=oR0LAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA525&amp;dq=Roman+ars+boni+et+aequi | title=Encyclopedic Dictionary of Roman Law| isbn=9780871694324| last1=Berger| first1=Adolf| year=1953}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Law is a system that regulates and ensures that individuals or a community adhere to the will of the state. State-enforced laws can be made by a collective [[legislature]] or by a single legislator, resulting in [[statute]]s, by the executive through [[decree]]s and [[regulation]]s, or established by judges through [[precedent]], normally in [[common law]] jurisdictions. Private individuals can create legally binding [[contract]]s, including arbitration agreements that may elect to accept alternative arbitration to the normal court process. The formation of laws themselves may be influenced by a [[constitution]], written or tacit, and the [[rights]] encoded therein. The law shapes [[politics]], [[economics]], [[history]] and [[society]] in various ways and serves as a mediator of relations between people.

A general distinction can be made between (a) [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] [[jurisdiction]]s, in which a legislature or other central body codifies and consolidates their laws, and (b) [[common law]] systems, where judge-made [[precedent]] is accepted as [[Legally binding|binding]] law. Historically, [[religious law]]s played a significant role even in settling of secular matters, and is still used in some religious communities. Islamic [[Sharia law]] is the world's most widely used religious law, and is used as the primary legal system in some countries, such as Iran and Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brightknowledge.org/knowledge-bank/law-and-politics/spotlight-on-law/what-is-sharia-law|title=What is sharia law?|work=brightknowledge.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019060625/http://www.brightknowledge.org/knowledge-bank/law-and-politics/spotlight-on-law/what-is-sharia-law/|archivedate=19 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The adjudication of the law is generally divided into two main areas. [[Criminal law]] deals with conduct that is considered harmful to [[social order]] and in which the [[guilt (law)|guilty]] party may be imprisoned or fined. [[Civil law (common law)|Civil law]] (not to be confused with civil law jurisdictions above) deals with the resolution of [[lawsuits]] (disputes) between individuals or organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cscja-acjcs.ca/criminal_civil_law-en.asp?l=4|title=Criminal and Civil Law|website=www.cscja-acjcs.ca|access-date=2016-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Law provides a source of scholarly inquiry into [[legal history]], [[philosophy]], [[economic analysis of law|economic analysis]] and [[sociology of law|sociology]]. Law also raises important and complex issues concerning equality, fairness, and [[justice]].

== Definition ==
{{Main|Definition of law|Analytical jurisprudence}}

=== Mainstream definitions ===
Numerous definitions of ''law'' have been put forward over the centuries. The ''Third New International Dictionary'' from Merriam-Webster&lt;ref&gt;''Third New International Dictionary'', Merriam-Webster, Inc., Springfield, Massachusetts.&lt;/ref&gt; defines law as: "Law is a binding custom or practice of a community; a rule or mode of conduct or action that is prescribed or formally recognized as binding by a supreme controlling authority or is made obligatory by a [[sanction (law)|sanction]] (as an edict, decree, rescript, order, ordinance, statute, resolution, rule, judicial decision, or usage) made, recognized, or enforced by the controlling authority."

The ''Dictionary of the History of Ideas'' published by Scribner's in 1973 defined the concept of law accordingly as: "A legal system is the most explicit, institutionalized, and complex mode of regulating human conduct. At the same time, it plays only one part in the congeries of rules which influence behavior, for social and moral rules of a less institutionalized kind are also of great importance."&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of the History of Ideas'', Charles Scribner's Sons, Editor Philip P. Weiner, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Whether it is possible or desirable to define law ===
There have been several attempts to produce "a universally acceptable definition of law". In 1972, one source indicated that no such definition could be produced.&lt;ref name="Jurisprudence. Third Edition 1972. Page 39"&gt;[[Lord Lloyd of Hampstead]]. ''Introduction to Jurisprudence''. Third Edition. Stevens &amp; Sons. London. 1972. Second Impression. 1975. p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; McCoubrey and White said that the question "what is law?" has no simple answer.&lt;ref&gt;Mc Coubrey, Hilaire and White, Nigel D. ''Textbook on Jurisprudence''. Second Edition. [[Blackstone Press Limited]]. 1996. {{ISBN|1-85431-582-X}}. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Glanville Williams]] said that the meaning of the word "law" depends on the context in which that word is used. He said that, for example, "[[early customary law]]" and "[[municipal law]]" were contexts where the word "law" had two different and irreconcilable meanings.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Glanville. International Law and the Controversy Concerning the Meaning of the Word "Law". Revised version published in Laslett (Editor), ''Philosophy, Politics and Society'' (1956) p. 134 et seq. The original was published in (1945) 22 [[British Year Book of International Law|BYBIL]] 146.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thurman Arnold]] said that it is obvious that it is impossible to define the word "law" and that it is also equally obvious that the struggle to define that word should not ever be abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Thurman. ''The Symbols of Government''. 1935. p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible to take the view that there is no need to define the word "law" (e.g. "let's forget about generalities and get down to [[Case law|cases]]").&lt;ref&gt;[[Lord Lloyd of Hampstead]]. ''Introduction to Jurisprudence''. Third Edition. Stevens &amp; Sons. London. 1972. Second Impression. 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Milkau Oberer Teil der Stele mit dem Text von Hammurapis Gesetzescode 369-2.jpg|thumb|King [[Hammurabi]] is revealed the [[Code of Hammurabi|code of laws]] by the Mesopotamian sun god [[Shamash]], also revered as the god of justice.]]

The history of law links closely to the development of [[civilization]]. [[Ancient Egypt]]ian law, dating as far back as 3000&amp;nbsp;BC, contained a civil code that was probably broken into twelve books. It was based on the concept of [[Ma'at]], characterised by tradition, [[rhetoric]]al speech, social equality and impartiality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Théodoridés|title = law | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;VerSteeg, ''Law in ancient Egypt''&lt;/ref&gt; By the 22nd century&amp;nbsp;BC, the ancient [[Sumer]]ian ruler [[Ur-Nammu]] had formulated the first [[Code of Ur-Nammu|law code]], which consisted of [[Casuistry|casuistic]] statements ("if … then ..."). Around 1760&amp;nbsp;BC, [[Hammurabi|King Hammurabi]] further developed [[Babylonian law]], by codifying and inscribing it in stone. Hammurabi placed several copies of his law code throughout the kingdom of Babylon as [[Stele|stelae]], for the entire public to see; this became known as the [[Code of Hammurabi|Codex Hammurabi]]. The most intact copy of these stelae was discovered in the 19th century by British [[Assyriologists]], and has since been fully [[transliterated]] and translated into various languages, including English, Italian, German, and French.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, ''Hammurabi's Laws'', 11&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Old Testament]] dates back to 1280&amp;nbsp;BC and takes the form of moral imperatives as recommendations for a good society. The small [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] city-state, ancient [[History of Athens|Athens]], from about the 8th century BC was the first society to be based on broad inclusion of its citizenry, excluding women and the [[slavery|slave]] class. However, Athens had no legal science or single word for "law",&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, ''A Short History of Western Legal Theory'', 5–6&lt;/ref&gt; relying instead on the three-way distinction between divine law (''thémis''), human decree (''nomos'') and custom (''díkē'').&lt;ref&gt;J.P. Mallory, "Law", in ''Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture'', 346&lt;/ref&gt; Yet [[Ancient Greek law]] contained major [[Solonian Constitution|constitutional]] innovations in the development of [[Athenian democracy|democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Ober, ''The Nature of Athenian Democracy'', 121&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roman law]] was heavily influenced by Greek philosophy, but its detailed rules were developed by professional jurists and were highly sophisticated.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, ''A Short History of Western Legal Theory'', 39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stein, ''Roman Law in European History'', 1&lt;/ref&gt; Over the centuries between the rise and decline of the [[Roman Empire]], law was adapted to cope with the changing social situations and underwent major codification under [[Theodosius II]] and [[Justinian I]].&lt;ref name="St107"&gt;As a legal system, Roman law has affected the development of law worldwide. It also forms the basis for the law codes of most countries of continental Europe and has played an important role in the creation of the idea of a common European culture (Stein, ''Roman Law in European History'', 2, 104–107).&lt;/ref&gt; Although codes were replaced by [[custom (law)|custom]] and [[case law]] during the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], Roman law was rediscovered around the 11th century when medieval legal scholars began to research Roman codes and adapt their concepts. Latin [[legal maxim]]s (called [[brocard (law)|brocards]]) were compiled for guidance. In medieval England, royal courts developed a body of [[precedent]] which later became the [[common law]]. A Europe-wide [[Law Merchant]] was formed so that merchants could trade with common standards of practice rather than with the many splintered facets of local laws. The Law Merchant, a precursor to modern commercial law, emphasised the freedom to contract and alienability of property.&lt;ref&gt;Sealey-Hooley, ''Commercial Law'', 14&lt;/ref&gt; As [[nationalism]] grew in the 18th and 19th centuries, the Law Merchant was incorporated into countries' local law under new civil codes. The [[Napoleonic Code|Napoleonic]] and [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|German]] Codes became the most influential. In contrast to English common law, which consists of enormous tomes of case law, codes in small books are easy to export and easy for judges to apply. However, today there are signs that civil and common law are converging.&lt;ref&gt;Mattei, ''Comparative Law and Economics'', 71&lt;/ref&gt; EU law is codified in treaties, but develops through the precedent laid down by the [[European Court of Justice]].

[[File:Constitution of India.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Constitution of India]] is the longest written constitution for a country, containing 444 articles, 12 schedules, numerous amendments and 117,369 words.]]

Ancient [[Law of India|India]] and [[Chinese law|China]] represent distinct traditions of law, and have historically had independent schools of legal theory and practice. The ''[[Arthashastra]]'', probably compiled around 100&amp;nbsp;AD (although it contains older material), and the ''[[Manusmriti]]'' (c.&amp;nbsp;100–300&amp;nbsp;AD) were foundational treatises in India, and comprise texts considered authoritative legal guidance.&lt;ref&gt;For discussion of the composition and dating of these sources, see Olivelle, ''Manu's Code of Law'', 18–25.&lt;/ref&gt; Manu's central philosophy was tolerance and [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]], and was cited across Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 276&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Hinduism|Hindu]] tradition, along with Islamic law, was supplanted by the common law when India became part of the [[British Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 273&lt;/ref&gt; Malaysia, Brunei, [[Law of Singapore|Singapore]] and [[Law of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] also adopted the common law. The eastern Asia legal tradition reflects a unique blend of secular and religious influences.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 287&lt;/ref&gt; Japan was the first country to begin modernising its legal system along western lines, by importing bits of the [[Code Civil|French]], but mostly the German Civil Code.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 304&lt;/ref&gt; This partly reflected Germany's status as a rising power in the late 19th&amp;nbsp;century. Similarly, [[traditional Chinese law]] gave way to westernisation towards the final years of the [[Qing Dynasty]] in the form of six private law codes based mainly on the Japanese model of German law.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 305&lt;/ref&gt; Today [[Law of the Republic of China|Taiwanese law]] retains the closest affinity to the codifications from that period, because of the split between [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s nationalists, who fled there, and [[Mao Zedong]]'s communists who won control of the mainland in 1949. The current legal infrastructure in the People's Republic of China was heavily influenced by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Socialist law]], which essentially inflates administrative law at the expense of private law rights.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 307&lt;/ref&gt; Due to rapid industrialisation, today China is undergoing a process of reform, at least in terms of economic, if not social and political, rights. A new contract code in 1999 represented a move away from administrative domination.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 309&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, after negotiations lasting fifteen years, in 2001 China joined the [[World Trade Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;Farah, ''Five Years of China WTO Membership'', 263–304&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Philosophy of law}}
{{quote box|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|width=22em|salign=left|quote=''"But what, after all, is a law? […] When I say that the object of laws is always general, I mean that law considers subjects en masse and actions in the abstract, and never a particular person or action. […] On this view, we at once see that it can no longer be asked whose business it is to make laws, since they are acts of the general will; nor whether the prince is above the law, since he is a member of the State; nor whether the law can be unjust, since no one is unjust to himself; nor how we can be both free and subject to the laws, since they are but registers of our wills."''|source=Jean-Jacques Rousseau, ''[[The Social Contract]]'', II, 6.&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, ''The Social Contract'', [http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/r/rousseau/jean_jacques/r864s/book2.html#section16 Book II: Chapter 6 (Law)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The philosophy of law is commonly known as (general) jurisprudence. Normative jurisprudence asks "what should law be?", while analytic jurisprudence asks "what is law?" [[John Austin (legal philosopher)|John Austin]]'s [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] answer was that law is "commands, backed by threat of sanctions, from a sovereign, to whom people have a habit of obedience".&lt;ref name="jap"&gt;Bix, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/austin-john/#3 John Austin]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Natural law]]yers on the other side, such as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], argue that law reflects essentially moral and unchangeable laws of nature. The concept of "natural law" emerged in ancient [[Greek philosophy]] concurrently and in connection with the notion of justice, and re-entered the mainstream of [[Western culture]] through the writings of [[Thomas Aquinas]], notably his ''[[Treatise on Law]]''.

[[Hugo Grotius]], the founder of a purely rationalistic system of natural law, argued that law arises from both a social impulse—as Aristotle had indicated—and reason.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fritz Berolzheimer]], ''The World's Legal Philosophies'', 115–116&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immanuel Kant]] believed a moral imperative requires laws "be chosen as though they should hold as universal laws of nature".&lt;ref&gt;[[Immanuel Kant|Kant, Immanuel]], ''Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals'', 42 (par. 434)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jeremy Bentham]] and his student Austin, following [[David Hume]], believed that this conflated the [[Is-ought problem|"is" and what "ought to be"]] problem. Bentham and Austin argued for law's [[legal positivism|positivism]]; that real law is entirely separate from "morality".&lt;ref&gt;Green, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/legal-positivism/ Legal Positivism]&lt;/ref&gt; Kant was also criticised by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], who rejected the principle of equality, and believed that law emanates from the [[will to power]], and cannot be labelled as "moral" or "immoral".&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, ''Zur Genealogie der Moral'', Second Essay, 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kazantzakis, ''Friedrich Nietzsche and the Philosophy of Law'', 97–98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linarelli, ''Nietzsche in Law's Cathedral'', 23–26&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, the Austrian philosopher [[Hans Kelsen]] continued the positivist tradition in his book the ''[[Pure Theory of Law]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Marmor, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/lawphil-theory/ The Pure Theory of Law]&lt;/ref&gt; Kelsen believed that although law is separate from morality, it is endowed with "normativity", meaning we ought to obey it. While laws are positive "is" statements (e.g. the fine for reversing on a highway ''is'' €500); law tells us what we "should" do. Thus, each legal system can be hypothesised to have a basic norm (''[[Grundnorm]]'') instructing us to obey. Kelsen's major opponent, [[Carl Schmitt]], rejected both positivism and the idea of the [[rule of law]] because he did not accept the primacy of abstract normative principles over concrete political positions and decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Bielefeldt, ''Carl Schmitt's Critique of Liberalism'', 25–26&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Schmitt advocated a jurisprudence of the exception ([[state of emergency]]), which denied that legal norms could encompass all of political experience.&lt;ref name="F171"&gt;Finn, ''Constitutions in Crisis'', 170–171&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jeremy Bentham by Henry William Pickersgill detail.jpg|thumb|Bentham's utilitarian theories remained dominant in law until the 20th century.]]

Later in the 20th century, [[H. L. A. Hart]] attacked Austin for his simplifications and Kelsen for his fictions in ''[[The Concept of Law]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Bayles, ''Hart's Legal Philosophy'', 21&lt;/ref&gt; Hart argued law is a system of rules, divided into primary (rules of conduct) and secondary ones (rules addressed to officials to administer primary rules). Secondary rules are further divided into rules of adjudication (to resolve legal disputes), rules of change (allowing laws to be varied) and the rule of recognition (allowing laws to be identified as valid). Two of Hart's students continued the debate: In his book ''[[Law's Empire]]'', [[Ronald Dworkin]] attacked Hart and the positivists for their refusal to treat law as a moral issue. Dworkin argues that law is an "[[interpretivism (legal)|interpretive]] concept",&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, ''[[Law's Empire]]'', 410.&lt;/ref&gt; that requires judges to find the best fitting and most just solution to a legal dispute, given their constitutional traditions. [[Joseph Raz]], on the other hand, defended the positivist outlook and criticised Hart's "soft social thesis" approach in ''The Authority of Law''.&lt;ref name="jra"&gt;Raz, ''The Authority of Law'', 3–36&lt;/ref&gt; Raz argues that law is authority, identifiable purely through social sources and without reference to moral reasoning. In his view, any categorisation of rules beyond their role as authoritative instruments in mediation are best left to [[sociology]], rather than jurisprudence.&lt;ref&gt;Raz, ''The Authority of Law'', 37 etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

One definition is that law is a system of rules and guidelines which are enforced through social institutions to govern behaviour&lt;!-- HIDDEN UNTIL VERIFIED, wherever possible--&gt;.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt; In ''[[The Concept of Law]]'' Hart argued law is a "system of rules";&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, ''The Contribution of Legal Studies'', 184&lt;/ref&gt; Austin said law was "the command of a sovereign, backed by the threat of a sanction";&lt;ref name="jap" /&gt; Dworkin describes law as an "interpretive concept" to achieve [[justice]] in his text titled ''[[Law's Empire]]'';&lt;ref name="Dworkin, [[Law's Empire]], 410"&gt;Dworkin, ''[[Law's Empire]]'', 410&lt;/ref&gt; and Raz argues law is an "authority" to mediate people's interests.&lt;ref name="jra" /&gt; Holmes said "The prophecies of what the courts will do in fact, and nothing more pretentious, are what I mean by the law."&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, Oliver Wendell.

=== Economic analysis ===
{{Main|Law and economics}}

In the 18th century [[Adam Smith]] presented a philosophical foundation for explaining the relationship between law and economics.&lt;ref&gt;According to Malloy (''Law and Economics'', 114), Smith established "a classical liberal philosophy that made individuals the key referential sign while acknowledging that we live not alone but in community with others".&lt;/ref&gt; The discipline arose partly out of a critique of trade unions and U.S. [[antitrust]] law. The most influential proponents, such as [[Richard Posner]] and [[Oliver E. Williamson|Oliver Williamson]] and the so-called [[Chicago school (economics)|Chicago School]] of economists and lawyers including [[Milton Friedman]] and [[Gary Becker]], are generally advocates of [[deregulation]] and [[privatisation]], and are hostile to state regulation or what they see as restrictions on the operation of [[free market]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Jakoby, ''Economic Ideas and the Labour Market'', 53&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Richard-A-Posner.jpg|thumb|left|[[Richard Posner]], one of the [[Chicago school (economics)|Chicago School]], runs a blog with [[Bank of Sweden Prize]] winning economist [[Gary Becker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uchicagolaw.typepad.com/beckerposner/ |title=The Becker-Posner Blog |accessdate=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The most prominent economic analyst of law is 1991 [[Nobel Prize in Economics|Nobel Prize]] winner [[Ronald Coase]], whose first major article, ''[[The Nature of the Firm]]'' (1937), argued that the reason for the existence of firms (companies, partnerships, etc.) is the existence of [[transaction cost]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Coase, ''The Nature of the Firm'', 386–405&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homo economicus|Rational individuals]] trade through bilateral contracts on open markets until the costs of transactions mean that using corporations to produce things is more cost-effective. His second major article, ''[[The Problem of Social Cost]]'' (1960), argued that if we lived in a world without transaction costs, people would [[bargaining|bargain]] with one another to create the same allocation of resources, regardless of the way a court might rule in property disputes.&lt;ref&gt;Coase, ''The Problem of Social Cost'', 1–44&lt;/ref&gt; Coase used the example of a [[nuisance]] case named ''[[Sturges v Bridgman]]'', where a noisy sweetmaker and a quiet doctor were neighbours and went to court to see who should have to move.&lt;ref name="Sturges" /&gt; Coase said that regardless of whether the judge ruled that the sweetmaker had to stop using his machinery, or that the doctor had to put up with it, they could strike a mutually beneficial bargain about who moves that reaches the same outcome of resource distribution. Only the existence of [[transaction costs]] may prevent this.&lt;ref&gt;Coase, ''The Problem of Social Cost'', IV, 7&lt;/ref&gt; So the law ought to pre-empt what ''would'' happen, and be guided by the most [[efficiency (economics)|efficient]] solution. The idea is that law and regulation are not as important or effective at helping people as lawyers and government planners believe.&lt;ref&gt;Coase, ''The Problem of Social Cost'', V, 9&lt;/ref&gt; Coase and others like him wanted a change of approach, to put the burden of proof for positive effects on a government that was intervening in the market, by analysing the costs of action.&lt;ref&gt;Coase, ''The Problem of Social Cost'', VIII, 23&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sociology ===
{{Main|Sociology of law}}

Sociology of law is a diverse field of study that examines the interaction of law with society and overlaps with jurisprudence, philosophy of law, social theory and more specialised subjects such as [[criminology]].&lt;ref name="Jary"&gt;Cotterrell, ''Sociology of Law'', Jary, ''Collins Dictionary of Sociology'', 636&lt;/ref&gt; The institutions of [[social construction]], [[social norms]], dispute processing and [[legal culture]] are key areas for inquiry in this knowledge field. Sociology of law is sometimes seen as a sub-discipline of sociology, but its ties to the academic discipline of law are equally strong, and it is best seen as a transdisciplinary and multidisciplinary study focused on the theorisation and empirical study of legal practices and experiences as social phenomena. In the United States the field is usually called [[law and society]] studies; in Europe it is more often referred to as socio-legal studies. At first, jurists and legal philosophers were suspicious of sociology of law. Kelsen attacked one of its founders, [[Eugen Ehrlich]], who sought to make clear the differences and connections between positive law, which lawyers learn and apply, and other forms of 'law' or social norms that regulate everyday life, generally preventing conflicts from reaching barristers and courts.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich, ''Fundamental Principles'', Hertogh, ''Living Law'', Rottleuthner, ''La Sociologie du Droit en Allemagne'', 109, Rottleuthner, ''Rechtstheoritische Probleme der Sociologie des Rechts'', 521&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary research in sociology of law is much concerned with the way that law is developing outside discrete state jurisdictions, being produced through social interaction in many different kinds of social arenas, and acquiring a diversity of sources of (often competing or conflicting) authority in communal networks existing sometimes within nation states but increasingly also transnationally.&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell, ''Law, Culture and Society''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Max Weber 1917.jpg|thumb|left|[[Max Weber]] in 1917, Weber began his career as a lawyer, and is regarded as one of the founders of sociology and sociology of law.]]

Around 1900 [[Max Weber]] defined his "scientific" approach to law, identifying the "legal rational form" as a type of domination, not attributable to personal authority but to the authority of abstract norms.&lt;ref&gt;Rheinstein, ''Max Weber on Law and Economy in Society'', 336&lt;/ref&gt; Formal legal rationality was his term for the key characteristic of the kind of coherent and calculable law that was a precondition for modern political developments and the modern bureaucratic state. Weber saw this law as having developed in parallel with the growth of capitalism.&lt;ref name="Jary" /&gt; Another leading sociologist, [[Émile Durkheim]], wrote in his classic work ''The Division of Labour in Society'' that as society becomes more complex, the body of civil law concerned primarily with restitution and compensation grows at the expense of criminal laws and penal sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell, ''Emile Durkheim: Law in a Moral Domain'', Johnson, ''The Blackwell Dictionary of Sociology'', 156&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable early legal sociologists included [[Hugo Sinzheimer]], [[Theodor Geiger]], [[Georges Gurvitch]] and [[Leon Petrażycki]] in Europe, and [[William Graham Sumner]] in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Gurvitch, ''Sociology of Law'', 142&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Papachristou, ''Sociology of Law'', 81–82&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodological background ==
Law is complex from a methodological viewpoint. Its peculiar features make its unique against the background of other sciences and disciplines.

First, it is not only of a normative but also of a prescriptive nature. Law says how people ought to behave or not, what they may or may not require from others, and what they have to or have not to do if someone ask for that. But normative statements in law are deprived of a descriptive  or causal character as opposed to normative statements in empirical science (as a law of gravity) or even social science (as a law of demand and supply in economics).

Second, there is no possibility of empirical verification of the contents of law.  Whether the law should or should not comprise precepts of such-and-such import remains far beyond empirical proof. It is a matter of choice.

Third, law is dependent on the shape of the physical world and the limitations inherent in it. It cannot mandate behaviours which are unattainable or force people to do things which are beyond their capabilities.

Fourth, law is fully contingent on humans and their minds. Without humans and their mental operations it would be very difficult to speak about the law, its enforcement and application.

Fifth, law agents, such as judges, advocates and officials, are unspecialized in the sense that they lack some complex theories as to good and evil, empirical and social science or justice (proper distribution of goods/privileges and burdens in a society).

Sixth, the role of authority is prominent in law, while at the same time in law there are not means which enable us to check the correctness of authoritative statements (be they comprised in judicial opinions or scholarly literature).

Seventh, the procedure in which law is authoritatively applied is very specific. It is rigorous, precise, complex, casuistic and often very formal. The outcome of such procedure is obligatory in the sense that a judge cannot free himself or herself from passing his/her decision. There are also very limited means for re-opening such procedure when its being once completed.&lt;ref&gt;See Maciej Koszowski, Why Does Legal Reasoning Have to Be Unique?. The Indonesian Journal of International &amp; Comparative Law no. 3/2016, pp.  555–575.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal methods ==

There are distinguished methods of legal reasoning (applying the law) and methtods of interpreting (construing) the law.
The former are [[legal syllogism]], which holds sway in civil law legal systems,  [[analogy]], which is present in common law legal systems, especially in the US, and argumentative theories that occur in both systems. The latter are different rules (directives) of legal interpretation such as directives of linguistic interpretation, teleological interpretation or systemic interpretation as well as more specific rules, for instance, [[golden rule]] or [[mischief rule]]. There are also many other arguments and cannons of interpretation which altogether make [[statutory interpretation]] possible.

== Legal systems ==
{{Main|List of national legal systems}}
In general, legal systems can be split between civil law and common law systems.&lt;ref&gt;Modern scholars argue that the significance of this distinction has progressively declined; the numerous [[legal transplants]], typical of modern law, result in the sharing by modern legal systems of many features traditionally considered typical of either common law or civil law (Mattei, ''Comparative Law and Economics'', 71)&lt;/ref&gt; The term "civil law" referring to a legal system should not be confused with "civil law" as a group of legal subjects distinct from criminal or [[public law]]. A third type of legal system—accepted by some countries without [[separation of church and state]]—is religious law, based on [[scripture]]s. The specific system that a country is ruled by is often determined by its history, connections with other countries, or its adherence to international standards. The [[sources of law|sources]] that jurisdictions adopt as authoritatively binding are the defining features of any legal system. Yet classification is a matter of form rather than substance, since similar rules often prevail.

=== Civil law ===
{{Main|Civil law (legal system)}}

[[File:Mosaic of Justinianus I - Basilica San Vitale (Ravenna).jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7| Emperor [[Justinian]] (527–565) of the [[Byzantine Empire]] who ordered the codification of [[Corpus Juris Civilis]].]]

[[File:Code Civil 1804.png|thumb|First page of the 1804 edition of the [[Napoleonic Code]].]]

Civil law is the legal system used in most countries around the world today. In civil law the sources recognised as authoritative are, primarily, legislation—especially [[Codification (law)|codifications]] in constitutions or [[statute]]s passed by government—and [[custom (law)|custom]].&lt;ref&gt;Civil law jurisdictions recognise custom as "the other source of law"; hence, scholars tend to divide the civil law into the broad categories of "written law" (''ius scriptum'') or legislation, and "unwritten law" (''ius non scriptum'') or custom. Yet they tend to dismiss custom as being of slight importance compared to legislation (Georgiadis, ''General Principles of Civil Law'', 19; Washofsky, ''Taking Precedent Seriously'', 7).&lt;/ref&gt; Codifications date back millennia, with one early example being the [[Babylonian law|Babylonian]] ''[[Code of Hammurabi|Codex Hammurabi]]''. Modern civil law systems essentially derive from the legal practice of the 6th-century [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]] whose texts were rediscovered by late [[Middle Ages|medieval]] Western Europe. Roman law in the days of the [[Roman Republic]] and Empire was heavily procedural, and lacked a professional legal class.&lt;ref&gt;Gordley-von Mehren, ''Comparative Study of Private Law'', 18&lt;/ref&gt; Instead a lay [[magistrate]], ''iudex'', was chosen to adjudicate. Decisions were not published in any systematic way, so any case law that developed was disguised and almost unrecognised.&lt;ref&gt;Gordley-von Mehren, ''Comparative Study of Private Law'', 21&lt;/ref&gt; Each case was to be decided afresh from the laws of the State, which mirrors the (theoretical) unimportance of judges' decisions for future cases in civil law systems today. From 529–534 AD the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Emperor [[Justinian I]] codified and consolidated Roman law up until that point, so that what remained was one-twentieth of the mass of legal texts from before.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, ''Roman Law in European History'', 32&lt;/ref&gt; This became known as the ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]''. As one legal historian wrote, "Justinian consciously looked back to the golden age of Roman law and aimed to restore it to the peak it had reached three centuries before."&lt;ref&gt;Stein, ''Roman Law in European History'', 35&lt;/ref&gt; The Justinian Code remained in force in the East until the fall of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Western Europe, meanwhile, relied on a mix of the [[Codex Theodosianus|Theodosian Code]] and Germanic customary law until the Justinian Code was rediscovered in the 11th century, and scholars at the [[University of Bologna]] used it to interpret their own laws.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, ''Roman Law in European History'', 43&lt;/ref&gt; Civil law codifications based closely on Roman law, alongside some influences from [[religious law]]s such as [[canon law]], continued to spread throughout Europe until the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]; then, in the 19th century, both France, with the ''[[Code Civil]]'', and Germany, with the ''[[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch]]'', modernised their legal codes. Both these codes influenced heavily not only the law systems of the countries in continental Europe (e.g. Greece), but also the [[Law of Japan|Japanese]] and [[South Korea|Korean]] legal traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Hatzis, ''The Short-Lived Influence of the Napoleonic Civil Code in Greece'', 253–263&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Demirgüç-Kunt -Levine, ''Financial Structures and Economic Growth'', 204&lt;/ref&gt; Today, countries that have civil law systems range from [[Law of Russia|Russia]] and [[Law of the People's Republic of China|China]] to most of [[Central America|Central]] and [[Law of South America|Latin America]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2100.html The World Factbook&amp;nbsp;– Field Listing&amp;nbsp;– Legal system], CIA&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of Louisiana's Civil Code, the United States follows the common law system described below.

=== Common law and equity ===
{{Main|Common law}}
[[File:Joao sem terra assina carta Magna.jpg|thumb|King John of England signs Magna Carta]]

In [[Common law#1. Common law as opposed to statutory law and regulatory law|common law legal systems]], decisions by courts are explicitly acknowledged as "law" on equal footing with [[statute law|statutes]] adopted through the legislative process and with [[Regulation (law)|regulations]] issued by the [[Executive (government)|executive branch]].  The "doctrine of precedent", or ''[[stare decisis]]'' (Latin for "to stand by decisions") means that decisions by higher courts bind lower courts, and future decisions of the same court, to assure that similar cases reach similar results.  In [[Common law#2. Common law legal systems as opposed to civil law legal systems|contrast]], in "[[civil law (legal system)|civil law]]" systems, legislative statutes are typically more detailed, and judicial decisions are shorter and less detailed, because the judge or barrister is only writing to decide the single case, rather than to set out reasoning that will guide future courts.

Common law originated from England and has been inherited by almost every country once tied to the [[British Empire]] (except Malta, [[Law of Scotland|Scotland]], the U.S. state of [[Louisiana law|Louisiana]], and the Canadian province of [[Quebec law|Quebec]]). In medieval England, the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]] the law varied-shire-to-shire, based on disparate tribal customs. The concept of a "common law" developed during the reign of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] during the late 12th century, when Henry appointed judges that had authority to create an institutionalized and unified system of law "common" to the country. The next major step in the evolution of the common law came when [[John of England|King John]] was forced by his barons to sign a document limiting his authority to pass laws. This "great charter" or ''[[Magna Carta]]'' of 1215 also required that the King's entourage of judges hold their courts and judgments at "a certain place" rather than dispensing autocratic justice in unpredictable places about the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/magnacarta.html Magna Carta], Fordham University&lt;/ref&gt; A concentrated and elite group of judges acquired a dominant role in law-making under this system, and compared to its European counterparts the English judiciary became highly centralized. In 1297, for instance, while the highest court in France had fifty-one judges, the [[English Court of Common Pleas]] had five.&lt;ref&gt;Gordley-von Mehren, ''Comparative Study of Private Law'', 4&lt;/ref&gt; This powerful and tight-knit judiciary gave rise to a systematized process of developing common law.&lt;ref&gt;Gordley-von Mehren, ''Comparative Study of Private Law'', 3&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the system became overly systematized—overly rigid and inflexible.  As a result, as time went on, increasing numbers of citizens petitioned the King to override the common law, and on the King's behalf the [[Lord Chancellor]] gave judgment to do what was equitable in a case. From the time of [[Thomas More|Sir Thomas More]], the first [[lawyer]] to be appointed as Lord Chancellor, a systematic body of equity grew up alongside the rigid common law, and developed its own [[Court of Chancery]]. At first, equity was often criticized as erratic, that it varied according to the length of the Chancellor's foot.&lt;ref&gt;Pollock (ed) ''Table Talk of [[John Selden]]'' (1927) 43; "Equity is a roguish thing. For law we have a measure... equity is according to the conscience of him that is Chancellor, and as that is longer or narrower, so is equity. 'Tis all one as if they should make the standard for the measure a Chancellor's foot."&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, courts of equity developed solid [[Maxims of equity|principles]], especially under [[John Scott, 1st Earl of Eldon|Lord Eldon]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Gee v Pritchard]]'' (1818) 2 Swans. 402, 414&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century in England, and in [[West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish|1937 in the U.S.]], the two systems were [[Common law#1870 through 20th century, and the procedural merger of law and equity|merged]].

In developing the common law, [[Common law#Contrasting role of treatises and academic writings in common law and civil law systems|academic writings]] have always played an important part, both to collect overarching principles from dispersed case law, and to argue for change. [[William Blackstone]], from around 1760, was the first scholar to collect, describe, and teach the common law.&lt;ref&gt;Blackstone, ''Commentaries on the Laws of England'', [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/blackstone_bk1ch1.asp Book the First&amp;nbsp;– Chapter the First]&lt;/ref&gt; But merely in describing, scholars who sought explanations and underlying structures slowly changed the way the law actually worked.&lt;ref&gt;Gordley-von Mehren, ''Comparative Study of Private Law'', 17&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religious law ===
{{Main|Religious law}}
Religious law is explicitly based on religious precepts. Examples include the Jewish [[Halakha]] and Islamic [[Sharia]]—both of which translate as the "path to follow"—while Christian [[canon law]] also survives in some church communities. Often the implication of religion for law is unalterability, because the word of God cannot be amended or legislated against by judges or governments.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} However a thorough and detailed legal system generally requires human elaboration. For instance, the [[Quran]] has some law, and it acts as a source of further law through interpretation,&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 159&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Qiyas]]'' (reasoning by analogy), ''[[Ijma]]'' (consensus) and [[precedent]]. This is mainly contained in a body of law and jurisprudence known as [[Sharia]] and [[Fiqh]] respectively. Another example is the [[Torah]] or [[Old Testament]], in the [[Pentateuch]] or Five Books of Moses. This contains the basic code of Jewish law, which some Israeli communities choose to use. The [[Halakha]] is a code of Jewish law which summarises some of the Talmud's interpretations. Nevertheless, [[Israeli law]] allows [[litigant]]s to use religious laws only if they choose. [[Canon law]] is only in use by members of the [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Catholic Church]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the [[Anglican Communion]].

[[File:1879-Ottoman Court-from-NYL.png|thumb|left|A trial in the Ottoman Empire, 1879, when religious law applied under the [[Mecelle]]]]

==== Sharia law ====
{{Main|Sharia}}
Until the 18th century, Sharia law was practiced throughout the [[Muslim world]] in a non-codified form, with the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s [[Mecelle]] code in the 19th century being a first attempt at [[Codification (law)|codifying]] elements of Sharia law. Since the mid-1940s, efforts have been made, in country after country, to bring Sharia law more into line with modern conditions and conceptions.&lt;ref name="AA"&gt;Anderson, ''Law Reform in the Middle East'', 43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Giannoulatos, ''Islam'', 274–275&lt;/ref&gt; In modern times, the legal systems of many Muslim countries draw upon both civil and common law traditions as well as Islamic law and custom. The constitutions of certain Muslim states, such as Egypt and Afghanistan, recognise Islam as the religion of the state, obliging legislature to adhere to Sharia.&lt;ref&gt;Sherif, ''Constitutions of Arab Countries'', 157–158&lt;/ref&gt; Saudi Arabia recognises Quran as its constitution, and is governed on the basis of Islamic law.&lt;ref name=Jurist&gt;[http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/world/saudiarabia.htm Saudi Arabia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060830232216/http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/world/saudiarabia.htm |date=30 August 2006 }}, Jurist&lt;/ref&gt; Iran has also witnessed a reiteration of Islamic law into its legal system after 1979.&lt;ref&gt;Akhlagi, ''Iranian Commercial Law'', 127&lt;/ref&gt; During the last few decades, one of the fundamental features of the movement of [[Islamic resurgence]] has been the call to restore the Sharia, which has generated a vast amount of literature and affected [[Global politics|world politics]].&lt;ref name="H1"&gt;Hallaq, ''The Origins and Evolution of Islamic Law'', 1&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal institutions ==
{{quote box|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|width=22em|salign=left|quote=It is a real unity of them all in one and the same person, made by covenant of every man with every man, in such manner as if every man should say to every man: I authorise and give up my right of governing myself to this man, or to this assembly of men, on this condition; that thou givest up, thy right to him, and authorise all his actions in like manner.|source=Thomas Hobbes, ''Leviathan'', [http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/hobbes/leviathan-c.html#CHAPTERXVII XVII]}}

The main institutions of law in industrialised countries are independent [[courts]], representative parliaments, an accountable executive, the military and police, [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] organisation, the [[legal profession]] and [[civil society]] itself. John Locke, in his ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]'', and [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Baron de Montesquieu]] in ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]'', advocated for a [[separation of powers]] between the political, legislature and executive bodies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Montesquieu]], ''The Spirit of Laws'', [http://www.constitution.org/cm/sol_11.htm#006 Book XI: Of the Laws Which Establish Political Liberty, with Regard to the Constitution, Chapters 6–7]&lt;/ref&gt; Their principle was that no person should be able to usurp all powers of the [[State (polity)|state]], in contrast to the [[Absolute monarchy|absolutist]] theory of [[Thomas Hobbes]]' ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]''.&lt;ref name="H17"&gt;Thomas Hobbes, ''Leviathan'', [https://web.archive.org/web/20021125191001/http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/hobbes/leviathan-c.html#CHAPTERXVII XVII]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Max Weber]] and others reshaped thinking on the extension of state. Modern military, policing and bureaucratic power over ordinary citizens' daily lives pose special problems for accountability that earlier writers such as Locke or Montesquieu could not have foreseen. The custom and practice of the legal profession is an important part of people's access to [[justice]], whilst civil society is a term used to refer to the social institutions, communities and partnerships that form law's political basis.

=== Judiciary ===
{{Main|Judiciary}}
A judiciary is a number of judges mediating disputes to determine outcome. Most countries have systems of appeal courts, answering up to a supreme legal authority. In the United States, this authority is the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/briefoverview.pdf A Brief Overview of the Supreme Court], Supreme Court of the United States&lt;/ref&gt; in Australia, the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]]; in the UK, the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/briefoverview.pdf House of Lords Judgments], House of Lords&lt;/ref&gt; in Germany, the ''[[Bundesverfassungsgericht]]''; and in France, the ''[[Cour de cassation (France)|Cour de Cassation]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/entscheidungen.html Entscheidungen des Bundesverfassungsgerichts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061121164330/http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/entscheidungen.html |date=21 November 2006 }}, Bundesverfassungsgericht&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courdecassation.fr/jurisprudence_publications_documentation_2/ Jurisprudence, publications, documentation], Cour de cassation&lt;/ref&gt; For most European countries the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg can overrule national law, when EU law is relevant. The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg allows citizens of the [[Council of Europe]] member states to bring cases relating to human rights issues before it.&lt;ref&gt;Goldhaber, ''European Court of Human Rights'', 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Public hearing at the ICJ.jpg|thumb|left|The judges of the [[International Court of Justice]] in [[the Hague]]]]
Some countries allow their highest judicial authority to overrule legislation they determine to be [[constitutionality|unconstitutional]]. For example, in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', the United States Supreme Court nullified many state statutes that had established [[Racial segregation in the United States|racially segregated]] schools, finding such statutes to be incompatible with the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, ''Brown v. Board of Education''&lt;/ref&gt;

A judiciary is theoretically bound by the constitution, just as all other government bodies are. In most countries judges may only [[interpretivism (legal)|interpret]] the constitution and all other laws. But in common law countries, where matters are not constitutional, the judiciary may also create law under the [[doctrine of precedent]]. The UK, Finland and New Zealand assert the ideal of [[parliamentary sovereignty]], whereby the unelected judiciary may not overturn law passed by a democratic legislature.&lt;ref&gt;Dicey, ''Law of the Constitution'', 37–82&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[communist state]]s, such as China, the courts are often regarded as parts of the executive, or subservient to the legislature; governmental institutions and actors exert thus various forms of influence on the judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., the court president is a political appointee (Jensen–Heller, ''Introduction'', 11–12). About the notion of "judicial independence" in China, see Findlay, ''Judiciary in the PRC'', 282–284&lt;/ref&gt; In Muslim countries, courts often examine whether state laws adhere to the Sharia: the [[Supreme Constitutional Court of Egypt]] may invalidate such laws,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Sherif, ''Constitutions of Arab Countries'', 158&lt;/ref&gt; and in Iran the [[Guardian Council]] ensures the compatibility of the legislation with the "criteria of Islam".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rasekh, ''Islamism and Republicanism'', 115–116&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legislature ===
{{Main|Legislature}}
[[File:European-parliament-brussels-inside.JPG|thumb|The debating chamber of the [[European Parliament]]]]
Prominent examples of legislatures are the [[Houses of Parliament]] in London, the [[United States Congress|Congress]] in Washington D.C., the [[Bundestag]] in Berlin, the [[Duma]] in Moscow, the [[Parliament of Italy|Parlamento Italiano]] in Rome and the [[National Assembly of France|''Assemblée nationale'']] in Paris. By the principle of representative government people vote for politicians to carry out ''their'' wishes. Although countries like Israel, Greece, Sweden and China are [[unicameralism|unicameral]], most countries are [[bicameralism|bicameral]], meaning they have two separately appointed legislative houses.&lt;ref name="Riker101"&gt;Riker, ''The Justification of Bicameralism'', 101&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 'lower house' politicians are elected to represent smaller [[constituency|constituencies]]. The 'upper house' is usually elected to represent states in a [[Federal republic|federal]] system (as in Australia, Germany or the United States) or different voting configuration in a unitary system (as in France). In the UK the upper house is appointed by the government as a [[House of Lords|house of review]]. One criticism of bicameral systems with two elected chambers is that the upper and lower houses may simply mirror one another. The traditional justification of bicameralism is that an upper chamber acts as a house of review. This can minimise arbitrariness and injustice in governmental action.&lt;ref name="Riker101" /&gt;

To pass legislation, a majority of the members of a legislature must [[vote]] for a [[bill (proposed law)]] in each house. Normally there will be several readings and amendments proposed by the different political factions. If a country has an entrenched constitution, a special majority for changes to the constitution may be required, making changes to the law more difficult. A government usually leads the process, which can be formed from Members of Parliament (e.g. the UK or Germany). However, in a presidential system, the government is usually formed by an executive and his or her appointed cabinet officials (e.g. the United States or Brazil).&lt;ref&gt;About "cabinet accountability" in both presidential and parliamentary systems, see Shugart–Haggard, ''Presidential Systems'', 67 etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Executive ===
{{Main|Executive (government)}}
[[File:Dmitry Medvedev 2 April 2009-1.jpg|left|thumb|The [[G-20 major economies|G20]] meetings are composed of representatives of each country's executive branch.]]
The executive in a legal system serves as the centre of political [[authority]] of the [[State (polity)|State]]. In a [[parliamentary system]], as with Britain, Italy, Germany, India, and Japan, the executive is known as the cabinet, and composed of members of the legislature. The executive is led by the [[head of government]], whose office holds power under the [[Motion of no confidence|confidence]] of the legislature. Because popular elections appoint political parties to govern, the leader of a party can change in between elections.&lt;ref name="Haggard71"&gt;Haggard, ''Presidents, Parliaments and Policy'', 71&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[head of state]] is apart from the executive, and symbolically enacts laws and acts as representative of the nation. Examples include the [[President of Germany]] (appointed by [[Federal Convention (Germany)|members of federal and state legislatures]]), the [[Queen of the United Kingdom]] (an [[Hereditary monarchy|hereditary office]]), and the [[President of Austria]] (elected by popular vote). The other important model is the [[presidential system]], found in the [[President of the United States|United States]] and in [[President of Brazil|Brazil]]. In presidential systems, the executive acts as both head of state and head of government, and has power to appoint an unelected cabinet. Under a presidential system, the executive branch is separate from the legislature to which it is not accountable.&lt;ref name="Haggard71" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olson, ''The New Parliaments of Central and Eastern Europe'', 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the role of the executive varies from country to country, usually it will propose the majority of legislation, and propose government agenda. In presidential systems, the executive often has the power to veto legislation. Most executives in both systems are responsible for [[Foreign policy|foreign relations]], the military and police, and the bureaucracy. [[Minister (government)|Ministers]] or other officials head a country's public offices, such as a [[Foreign minister|foreign ministry]] or [[Defence minister|defence ministry]]. The election of a different executive is therefore capable of revolutionising an entire country's approach to government.

=== Military and police ===
{{Main|Military|Police}}
[[File:US Customs and Border Protection officers.jpg|thumb|[[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] officers]]

While military organisations have existed as long as government itself, the idea of a standing police force is a relatively modern concept. For example, [[Medieval England]]'s system of traveling [[criminal court]]s, or [[Assize Court|assizes]], used [[show trial]]s and public executions to instill communities with fear to maintain control.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g. ''Tuberville v Savage'' (1669), 1 Mod. Rep. 3, 86 Eng. Rep. 684, where a knight said in a threatening tone to a layman, "If it were not assize time, I would not take such language from you."&lt;/ref&gt; The first modern police were probably those in 17th-century Paris, in the court of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?articleId=219522 History of Police Forces] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061229014447/http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?articleId=219522 |date=29 December 2006 }}, History.com Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; although the Paris Prefecture of Police claim they were the world's first uniformed policemen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080506215949/http://www.prefecture-police-paris.interieur.gouv.fr/documentation/bicentenaire/theme_expo4.htm Des Sergents de Ville et Gardiens de la Paix à la Police de Proximité], La Préfecture de Police&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Max Weber]] famously argued that the state is that which controls the [[monopoly on the legitimate use of force]].&lt;ref name="mwp154"&gt;Weber, [[s:Politics as a Vocation|Politics as a Vocation]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weber, ''The Theory of Social and Economic Organisation'', 154&lt;/ref&gt; The military and police carry out enforcement at the request of the government or the courts. The term [[failed state]] refers to states that cannot implement or enforce policies; their police and military no longer control security and order and society moves into anarchy, the absence of government.&lt;ref&gt;In these cases sovereignty is eroded, and often warlords acquire excessive powers (Fukuyama, ''State-Building'', 166–167).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bureaucracy ===
{{Main|Bureaucracy}}
[[File:UN Headquarters 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The United Nations' New York [[United Nations Headquarters|headquarters]] houses civil servants that serve its 193 member states.]]

The etymology of "bureaucracy" derives from the French word for "office" (''bureau'') and the [[Ancient Greek]] for word "power" (''kratos'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=bureaucracy&amp;searchmode Bureaucracy], Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; Like the military and police, a legal system's government servants and bodies that make up its bureaucracy carry out the directives of the executive. One of the earliest references to the concept was made by [[Friedrich Melchior, baron von Grimm|Baron de Grimm]], a German author who lived in France. In 1765 he wrote,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The real spirit of the laws in France is that bureaucracy of which the late Monsieur de Gournay used to complain so greatly; here the offices, clerks, secretaries, inspectors and ''intendants'' are not appointed to benefit the public interest, indeed the public interest appears to have been established so that offices might exist.&lt;ref&gt;Albrow, ''Bureaucracy'', 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cynicism over "officialdom" is still common, and the workings of public servants is typically contrasted to [[private enterprise]] motivated by [[Maximization (economics)|profit]].&lt;ref&gt;Mises, ''Bureaucracy'', II, [https://www.mises.org/etexts/mises/bureaucracy/section2.asp Bureaucratic Management]&lt;/ref&gt; In fact private companies, especially large ones, also have bureaucracies.&lt;ref name="K367"&gt;Kettl, ''Public Bureaucracies'', 367&lt;/ref&gt; Negative perceptions of "[[red tape]]" aside, public services such as schooling, health care, policing or public transport are considered a crucial state function making public bureaucratic action the locus of government power.&lt;ref name="K367" /&gt;

Writing in the early 20th century, Max Weber believed that a definitive feature of a developed state had come to be its bureaucratic support.&lt;ref name="mwp393"&gt;Weber, ''Economy and Society'', I, 393&lt;/ref&gt; Weber wrote that the typical characteristics of modern bureaucracy are that officials define its mission, the scope of work is bound by rules, and management is composed of career experts who manage top down, communicating through writing and binding public servants' discretion with rules.&lt;ref&gt;Kettl, ''Public Bureaucracies'', 371&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legal profession ===
{{Main|Legal profession}}
[[File:Quentin Massys 007.jpg|thumb|In civil law systems such as those of Italy, France, Germany, Spain and Greece, there is a distinct category of [[Civil law notary|notary]], a legally trained public official, compensated by the parties to a transaction.&lt;ref&gt;Hazard–Dondi, ''Legal Ethics'', 22&lt;/ref&gt; This is a 16th-century painting of such a notary by Flemish painter [[Quentin Massys]].]]

A corollary of the rule of law is the existence of a legal profession sufficiently autonomous to invoke the authority of the independent judiciary; the right to assistance of a [[barrister]] in a court proceeding emanates from this corollary—in England the function of barrister or advocate is distinguished from legal counselor.&lt;ref&gt;Hazard–Dondi, ''Legal Ethics'', 1&lt;/ref&gt; As the European Court of Human Rights has stated, the law should be adequately accessible to everyone and people should be able to foresee how the law affects them.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Sunday Times v The United Kingdom]]'' [1979] [http://www.worldlii.org/eu/cases/ECHR/1979/1.html ECHR 1 at 49] Case no. 6538/74&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to maintain professionalism, the [[practice of law]] is typically overseen by either a government or independent regulating body such as a [[bar association]], [[bar council]] or [[law society]]. Modern lawyers achieve distinct professional identity through specified legal procedures (e.g. successfully passing a qualifying examination), are required by law to have a special qualification (a legal education earning the student a [[Bachelor of Laws]], a [[Bachelor of Civil Law]], or a [[Juris Doctor]] degree. Higher academic degrees may also be pursued. Examples include a [[Master of Laws]], a [[Master of Legal Studies]], a [[Bar Professional Training Course]] or a [[Doctor of Laws]].), and are constituted in office by legal forms of appointment ([[admission to the bar|being admitted to the bar]]). There are few titles of respect to signify famous lawyers, such as [[Esquire]], to indicate barristers of greater dignity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=British English: Esquire|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/esquire?showCookiePolicy=true|accessdate=23 September 2014|date=n.d.|publisher=Collins Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/american/esquire?showCookiePolicy=true|publisher=Collins Dictionary|title=American English: Esquire|accessdate=23 September 2014|date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Doctor of law]], to indicate a person who obtained a [[PhD]] in Law.

Many Muslim countries have developed similar rules about legal education and the legal profession, but some still allow lawyers with training in traditional Islamic law to practice law before personal status law courts.&lt;ref&gt;Ahamd, [http://www.macalester.edu/~ahmad/Lawyers.pdf Lawyers: Islamic Law] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001195205/http://www.macalester.edu/~ahmad/Lawyers.pdf |date=1 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In China and other developing countries there are not sufficient professionally trained people to staff the existing judicial systems, and, accordingly, formal standards are more relaxed.&lt;ref&gt;Hazard–Dondi, ''Legal Ethics'', 22–23&lt;/ref&gt;

Once accredited, a lawyer will often work in a [[law firm]], in a [[chambers (law)|chambers]] as a sole practitioner, in a government post or in a private corporation as an internal [[counsel]]. In addition a lawyer may become a [[legal research]]er who provides on-demand legal research through a library, a commercial service or freelance work. Many people trained in law put their skills to use outside the legal field entirely.&lt;ref name="Fine364"&gt;Fine, ''The Globalisation of Legal Education'', 364&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant to the practice of law in the common law tradition is the legal research to determine the current state of the law. This usually entails exploring [[law report|case-law reports]], [[legal periodical]]s and legislation. Law practice also involves drafting documents such as court [[pleading]]s, persuasive [[brief (law)|briefs]], contracts, or [[will (law)|wills]] and trusts. Negotiation and [[dispute resolution]] skills (including [[Alternative dispute resolution|ADR]] techniques) are also important to legal practice, depending on the field.&lt;ref name="Fine364" /&gt;

=== Civil society ===
{{Main|Civil society}}
[[File:1963 march on washington.jpg|thumb|left|A march in Washington D.C. during the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in 1963]]

The [[classical republicanism|Classical republican]] concept of "civil society" dates back to Hobbes and Locke.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, ''Civil Society'', 3–4&lt;/ref&gt; Locke saw civil society as people who have "a common established law and judicature to appeal to, with authority to decide controversies between them."&lt;ref&gt;Locke, ''[[s:Two Treatises of Government/The Second Treatise of Government: An Essay Concerning the True Origin, Extent, and End of Civil Government|Second Treatise]]'', Chap. VII, Of Political or Civil_Society. Chapter 7, section 87&lt;/ref&gt; German philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] distinguished the "state" from "civil society" (''bürgerliche Gesellschaft'') in ''[[Elements of the Philosophy of Right]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, ''Elements of the Philosophy of Right'', 3, II, [http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prcivils.htm 182]; Karkatsoulis, ''The State in Transition'', 277–278&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel believed that [[civil society]] and the [[State (polity)|state]] were polar opposites, within the scheme of his dialectic theory of history. The modern dipole state–civil society was reproduced in the theories of [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] and [[Karl Marx]].&lt;ref&gt;(Pelczynski, ''The State and Civil Society'', 1–13; Warren, ''Civil Society'', 5–9)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays in post-modern theory civil society is necessarily a source of law, by being the basis from which people form opinions and lobby for what they believe law should be. As Australian barrister and author [[Geoffrey Robertson QC]] wrote of international law,

&lt;blockquote&gt;... one of its primary modern sources is found in the responses of ordinary men and women, and of the non-governmental organizations which many of them support, to the human rights abuses they see on the television screen in their living rooms.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, ''Crimes Against Humanity'', 98–99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Freedom of speech]], [[freedom of association]] and many other individual rights allow people to gather, discuss, criticise and hold to account their governments, from which the basis of a [[deliberative democracy]] is formed. The more people are involved with, concerned by and capable of changing how political power is exercised over their lives, the more acceptable and [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimate]] the law becomes to the people. The most familiar institutions of civil society include economic markets, profit-oriented firms, families, trade unions, hospitals, universities, schools, charities, [[cogers|debating clubs]], non-governmental organisations, neighbourhoods, churches, and religious associations.&lt;ref&gt;There is no clear legal definition of the civil society, and of the institutions it includes. Most of the institutions and bodies who try to give a list of institutions (such as the [[European Economic and Social Committee]]) exclude the political parties.

== Legal subjects ==
All legal systems deal with the same basic issues, but jurisdictions categorise and identify its legal subjects in different ways. A common distinction is that between "[[public law]]" (a term related closely to the [[State (law)|state]], and including constitutional, administrative and criminal law), and "[[private law]]" (which covers contract, [[tort]] and property).&lt;ref&gt;Although many scholars argue that "the boundaries between public and private law are becoming blurred", and that this distinction has become mere "folklore" (Bergkamp, ''Liability and Environment'', 1–2).&lt;/ref&gt; In [[civil law(legal system)|civil law]] systems, contract and tort fall under a general [[law of obligations]], while trusts law is dealt with under statutory regimes or [[Hague Convention on the Law Applicable to Trusts and on their Recognition|international conventions]]. International, constitutional and administrative law, criminal law, contract, tort, property law and [[trust law|trusts]] are regarded as the "traditional core subjects",&lt;ref&gt;E.g. in England these seven subjects, with EU law substituted for international law, make up a "qualifying law degree". For criticism, see [[Peter Birks]]' poignant comments attached to a previous version of the [http://webjcli.ncl.ac.uk/articles1/birks1.html#appendix Notice to Law Schools].&lt;/ref&gt; although there are many [[Law#Further disciplines|further disciplines]].

[[International law]] can refer to three things: public international law, private international law or conflict of laws and the law of supranational organisations.
* '''[[Public international law]]''' concerns relationships between sovereign nations. The [[Sources of international law|sources]] for public international law development are [[Custom (law)|custom]], practice and treaties between sovereign nations, such as the [[Geneva Conventions]]. Public international law can be formed by [[international organisations]], such as the United Nations (which was established after the failure of the [[League of Nations]] to prevent World War II),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/aboutun/history.htm History of the UN] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218221016/http://www.un.org/aboutun/history.htm |date=18 February 2010 }}, United Nations. [[Winston Churchill]] (''The Hinge of Fate'', 719) comments on the League of Nations' failure: "It was wrong to say that the League failed. It was rather the member states who had failed the League."&lt;/ref&gt; the [[International Labour Organization|International Labour Organisation]], the [[World Trade Organization]], or the [[International Monetary Fund]]. Public international law has a special status as law because there is no international police force, and courts (e.g. the [[International Court of Justice]] as the primary UN judicial organ) lack the capacity to penalise disobedience.&lt;ref&gt;The prevailing manner of enforcing international law is still essentially "self help"; that is the reaction by states to alleged breaches of international obligations by other states (Robertson, ''Crimes against Humanity'', 90; Schermers-Blokker, ''International Institutional Law'', 900–901).&lt;/ref&gt; However, a few bodies, such as the WTO, have effective systems of binding arbitration and dispute resolution backed up by trade sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;Petersmann, ''The GATT/WTO Dispute Settlement System'' [http://www.law2lawyer.com/2011/07/21/international-criminal-court/ International Criminal Court] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723080755/http://www.law2lawyer.com/2011/07/21/international-criminal-court/ |date=23 July 2011 }}, 32&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Conflict of laws]]''' (or "private international law" in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries) concerns which [[jurisdiction]] a legal dispute between private parties should be heard in and which jurisdiction's law should be applied. Today, businesses are increasingly capable of shifting [[Capital (economics)|capital]] and [[labour (economics)|labour]] supply chains across borders, as well as trading with overseas businesses, making the question of which country has jurisdiction even more pressing. Increasing numbers of businesses opt for commercial arbitration under the [[Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards|New York Convention 1958]].&lt;ref&gt;Redfem, ''International Commercial Arbitration'', 68–69&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[European Union law]]''' is the first and, so far, only example of an [[supranational law|internationally accepted legal system]] other than the [[United Nations|UN]] and the [[World Trade Organization]]. Given the trend of increasing global economic integration, many regional agreements—especially the [[Union of South American Nations]]—are on track to follow the same model. In the EU, sovereign nations have gathered their authority in a system of courts and [[European Parliament|political institutions]]. These institutions are allowed the ability to enforce legal norms both against or for member states and citizens in a manner which is not possible through public international law.&lt;ref&gt;Schermers–Blokker, ''International Institutional Law'', 943&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[European Court of Justice]] said in the 1960s, European Union law constitutes "a new legal order of international law" for the mutual social and economic benefit of the member states.&lt;ref&gt;See the fundamental [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61962J0026:EN:HTML C-26/62 ''Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen''], and [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61964J0006:EN:HTML ''Flaminio Costa v E.N.E.L.''] decisions of the European Court.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Constitutional and administrative law ===
{{Main|Constitutional law|Administrative law}}
[[File:Declaration of Human Rights.jpg|thumb|The French [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]]]
Constitutional and administrative law govern the affairs of the state. [[Constitutional law]] concerns both the relationships between the executive, legislature and judiciary and the human rights or [[civil liberties]] of individuals against the state. Most jurisdictions, like the [[Law of the United States|United States]] and [[Law of France|France]], have a single codified constitution with a [[bill of rights]]. A few, like the [[Law of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], have no such document. A "constitution" is simply those laws which constitute the [[body politic]], from [[statute]], [[case law]] and [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|convention]]. A case named ''[[Entick v Carrington]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Entick v Carrington]]'' (1765) 19 Howell's State Trials 1030; [1765] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/KB/1765/J98.html 95 ER 807]&lt;/ref&gt; illustrates a constitutional principle deriving from the common law. Mr Entick's house was searched and ransacked by Sheriff Carrington. When Mr Entick complained in court, Sheriff Carrington argued that a warrant from a Government minister, the [[George Montague-Dunk, 2nd Earl of Halifax|Earl of Halifax]], was valid authority. However, there was no written statutory provision or court authority. The leading judge, [[Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden|Lord Camden]], stated that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The great end, for which men entered into society, was to secure their property. That right is preserved sacred and incommunicable in all instances, where it has not been taken away or abridged by some public law for the good of the whole ... If no excuse can be found or produced, the silence of the books is an authority against the defendant, and the plaintiff must have judgment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.constitution.org/trials/entick/entick_v_carrington.htm | title=Entick v Carrington | work=19 Howell’s State Trials 1029 (1765) | publisher=Constitution Society | location=US | accessdate=13 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The fundamental constitutional principle, inspired by [[Two Treatises of Government|John Locke]], holds that [[Everything which is not forbidden is allowed|the individual can do anything except that which is forbidden by law]], and the state may do nothing except that which is authorised by law.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, ''The Second Treatise'', [[s:Two Treatises of Government/The Second Treatise of Government: An Essay Concerning the True Origin, Extent, and End of Civil Government#2:9|Chapter 9, section 124]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tamanaha, ''On the Rule of Law'', 47&lt;/ref&gt; Administrative law is the chief method for people to hold state bodies to account. People can sue an agency, local council, public service, or government ministry  for [[judicial review]] of actions or decisions, to ensure that they comply with the law, and that the government entity observed required procedure. The first specialist administrative court was the ''[[Council of State (France)|Conseil d'État]]'' set up in 1799, as [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] assumed power in France.&lt;ref name="A75"&gt;Auby, ''Administrative Law in France'', 75&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criminal law ===
{{Main|Criminal law}}
Criminal law, also known as penal law, pertains to crimes and punishment.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cesare, Marquis of Beccaria|Cesare Beccaria]]'s seminal treatise of 1763–1764 is titled ''On Crimes and Punishments'' (''[[Dei delitti e delle pene]]'').&lt;/ref&gt; It thus regulates the definition of and penalties for offences found to have a sufficiently deleterious social impact but, in itself, makes no moral judgment on an offender nor imposes restrictions on society that physically prevent people from committing a crime in the first place.&lt;ref name="W2"&gt;Brody, Acker and Logan, ''Criminal Law'', 2; Wilson, ''Criminal Law'', 2&lt;/ref&gt; Investigating, apprehending, charging, and trying suspected offenders is regulated by the law of [[criminal procedure]].&lt;ref name="Br2"&gt;Dennis J. Baker, Glanville Williams ''Textbook of Criminal Law'' (London: 2012), 2&lt;/ref&gt; The [[paradigm]] case of a crime lies in the proof, [[Legal burden of proof|beyond reasonable doubt]], that a person is guilty of two things. First, the accused must commit an act which is deemed by society to be criminal, or ''[[actus reus]]'' (guilty act).&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Brody, Acker and Logan, ''Criminal Law'', 205 about ''[[Robinson v. California]]'', 370 U.S. 660 (1962).&lt;/ref&gt; Second, the accused must have the requisite [[intention (criminal law)|malicious intent]] to do a criminal act, or ''[[mens rea]]'' (guilty mind). However, for so called "[[Strict liability (criminal)|strict liability]]" crimes, an ''actus reus'' is enough.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Feinman, ''Law 111'', 260–261 about ''[[Powell v. Texas]]'', 392 U.S. 514 (1968).&lt;/ref&gt; Criminal systems of the civil law tradition distinguish between intention in the broad sense (''dolus directus'' and ''dolus eventualis''), and negligence. Negligence does not carry criminal responsibility unless a particular crime provides for its punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Dörmann, Doswald-Beck and Kolb, ''Elements of War Crimes'', 491&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaiser, ''Leistungsstörungen'', 333&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SalemWitchcraftTrial large.jpg|thumb|left|A depiction of a 17th-century criminal trial, for [[witchcraft]] in [[Salem witch trials|Salem]]]]
Examples of crimes include murder, assault, fraud and theft. In exceptional circumstances defences can apply to specific acts, such as killing in [[self-defense (theory)|self defence]], or pleading [[insanity defense|insanity]]. Another example is in the 19th-century English case of ''[[R v Dudley and Stephens]]'', which tested a defence of "[[necessity (criminal law)|necessity]]". The ''Mignonette'', sailing from [[Southampton]] to Sydney, sank. Three crew members and Richard Parker, a 17-year-old cabin boy, were stranded on a raft. They were starving and the cabin boy was close to death. Driven to extreme hunger, the crew killed and ate the cabin boy. The crew survived and were rescued, but put on trial for murder. They argued it was necessary to kill the cabin boy to preserve their own lives. [[John Coleridge, 1st Baron Coleridge|Lord Coleridge]], expressing immense disapproval, ruled, "to preserve one's life is generally speaking a duty, but it may be the plainest and the highest duty to sacrifice it." The men were sentenced to [[hanging|hang]], but public opinion was overwhelmingly supportive of the crew's right to preserve their own lives. In the end, the [[Royal prerogative|Crown]] commuted their sentences to six months in jail.&lt;ref&gt;About ''R v Dudley and Stephens'' [1884] [http://www.justis.com/titles/iclr_bqb14040.html 14 QBD 273 DC] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050228224504/http://www.justis.com/titles/iclr_bqb14040.html |date=28 February 2005 }}, see Simpson, ''Cannibalism and the Common Law'', 212–217, 229–237&lt;/ref&gt;

Criminal law offences are viewed as offences against not just individual victims, but the community as well.&lt;ref name="W2" /&gt; The state, usually with the help of police, takes the lead in prosecution, which is why in common law countries cases are cited as "''The People'' v ..." or "''R'' (for [[Monarchy|Rex]] or [[Queen regnant|Regina]]) v ...". Also, lay [[jury|juries]] are often used to determine the guilt of defendants on points of fact: juries cannot change legal rules. Some developed countries still condone capital punishment for criminal activity, but the normal punishment for a crime will be [[prison|imprisonment]], [[fine (penalty)|fines]], state supervision (such as probation), or [[community service]]. Modern criminal law has been affected considerably by the social sciences, especially with respect to [[sentence (law)|sentencing]], legal research, legislation, and [[rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]].&lt;ref&gt;Pelser, ''Criminal Legislation'', 198&lt;/ref&gt; On the international field, 111 countries are [[States Parties to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|members]] of the [[International Criminal Court]], which was established to try people for [[crimes against humanity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ASP/states+parties/ The States Parties to the Rome Statute] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623085130/http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ASP/states+parties/ |date=23 June 2011 }}, International Criminal Court&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contract law ===
{{Main|Contract}}
[[File:carbolic smoke ball co.jpg|thumb|The famous Carbolic Smoke Ball advertisement to cure [[influenza]] was held to be a [[unilateral contract]]]]

Contract law concerns enforceable promises, and can be summed up in the Latin phrase ''[[pacta sunt servanda]]'' (agreements must be kept).&lt;ref&gt;Wehberg, ''Pacta Sunt Servanda'', 775&lt;/ref&gt; In common law jurisdictions, three key elements to the creation of a contract are necessary: [[offer and acceptance]], [[consideration]] and the intention to create legal relations. In ''[[Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company]]'' a medical firm advertised that its new wonder drug, the smokeball, would cure people's flu, and if it did not, the buyers would get [[pound sterling|£]]100. Many people sued for their £100 when the drug did not work. Fearing bankruptcy, Carbolic argued the advert was not to be taken as a serious, legally binding offer. It was an [[invitation to treat]], mere puffery, a gimmick. But the Court of Appeal held that to a [[reasonable man]] Carbolic had made a serious offer, accentuated by their reassuring statement, "£1000 is deposited". Equally, people had given good consideration for the offer by going to the "distinct inconvenience" of using a faulty product. "Read the advertisement how you will, and twist it about as you will", said [[Nathaniel Lindley, Baron Lindley|Lord Justice Lindley]], "here is a distinct promise expressed in language which is perfectly unmistakable".&lt;ref name="CCSBCE"&gt;About ''[http://www.justis.com/titles/iclr_r9321042.html Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041205104916/http://www.justis.com/titles/iclr_r9321042.html |date=5 December 2004 }}'' [[Case citation|[1893] 1 QB 256]], and the element of consideration, see Beale and Tallon, ''Contract Law'', 142–143&lt;/ref&gt;

"Consideration" indicates the fact that all parties to a contract have exchanged something of value. Some common law systems, including Australia, are moving away from the idea of consideration as a requirement. The idea of [[estoppel]] or ''culpa in contrahendo'', can be used to create obligations during pre-contractual negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Austotel v Franklins]]'' (1989) 16 NSWLR 582&lt;/ref&gt; In civil law jurisdictions, consideration is not required for a contract to be binding.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in Germany, [http://dejure.org/gesetze/BGB/311.html §&amp;nbsp;311 Abs. II] [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|BGB]]&lt;/ref&gt; In France, an ordinary contract is said to form simply on the basis of a "meeting of the minds" or a "concurrence of wills". [[Law of Germany|Germany]] has a special approach to contracts, which ties into property law. Their '[[abstraction principle (law)|abstraction principle]]' (''Abstraktionsprinzip'') means that the personal obligation of contract forms separately from the title of property being conferred. When contracts are invalidated for some reason (e.g. a car buyer is so drunk that he lacks legal capacity to contract)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dejure.org/gesetze/BGB/105.html|title=§&amp;nbsp;105 BGB Nichtigkeit der Willenserklärung|work=dejure.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; the contractual obligation to pay can be invalidated separately from the proprietary title of the car. [[Unjust enrichment]] law, rather than contract law, is then used to restore title to the rightful owner.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, ''The Structure of Unjust Enrichment Law'', 1037&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tort law ===
{{Main|Tort}}
[[File:Anti-McDonalds protest Leicester Square London 20041016.jpg|thumb|The "[[McLibel case]]" two were involved in the longest-running case in UK history for publishing a pamphlet criticising [[McDonald's]] restaurants.]]

Torts, sometimes called [[delict]]s, are civil wrongs. To have acted tortiously, one must have breached a duty to another person, or infringed some pre-existing legal right. A simple example might be accidentally hitting someone with a cricket ball.&lt;ref&gt;''Bolton v Stone'' [1951] AC 850&lt;/ref&gt; Under the law of [[negligence]], the most common form of tort, the injured party could potentially claim compensation for their injuries from the party responsible. The principles of negligence are illustrated by ''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]''.&lt;ref name="DvS"&gt;''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]'' ([[Case citation#England and Wales|[1932] A.C. 532, 1932 S.C. (H.L.) 31, [1932] All ER Rep 1]]). See the original text of the case in [http://www.leeds.ac.uk/law/hamlyn/donoghue.htm UK Law Online].&lt;/ref&gt; A friend of Mrs Donoghue ordered an opaque bottle of [[ginger beer]] (intended for the consumption of Mrs Donoghue) in a café in [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]]. Having consumed half of it, Mrs Donoghue poured the remainder into a tumbler. The decomposing remains of a snail floated out. She claimed to have suffered from shock, fell ill with gastroenteritis and sued the manufacturer for carelessly allowing the drink to be contaminated. The [[House of Lords]] decided that the manufacturer was liable for Mrs Donoghue's illness. [[Lord Atkin]] took a distinctly moral approach, and said,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The liability for negligence ... is no doubt based upon a general public sentiment of moral wrongdoing for which the offender must pay ... The rule that you are to love your neighbour becomes in law, you must not injure your neighbour; and the [[lawyer]]'s question, Who is my neighbour? receives a restricted reply. You must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]'' [1932] AC 532, 580&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This became the basis for the four principles of negligence: (1) Mr Stevenson owed Mrs Donoghue a [[duty of care]] to provide safe drinks (2) he [[Breach of duty in English law|breached]] his duty of care (3) the harm would not have occurred [[causation (law)|but for]] his breach and (4) his act was the [[proximate cause]] of her harm.&lt;ref name="DvS" /&gt; Another example of tort might be a neighbour making excessively loud noises with machinery on his property.&lt;ref name="Sturges"&gt;''[[Sturges v Bridgman]]'' (1879) 11 Ch D 852&lt;/ref&gt; Under a [[nuisance]] claim the noise could be stopped. Torts can also involve intentional acts, such as [[assault (tort)|assault]], [[battery (tort)|battery]] or [[trespass]]. A better known tort is [[slander and libel|defamation]], which occurs, for example, when a newspaper makes unsupportable allegations that damage a politician's reputation.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. concerning a British politician and the Iraq War, ''[[George Galloway#Daily Telegraph libel case|George Galloway v Telegraph Group Ltd]]'' [2004] EWHC 2786&lt;/ref&gt; More infamous are economic torts, which form the basis of [[labour law]] in some countries by making trade unions liable for strikes,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Taff Vale Railway Co v Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants]]'' [1901] AC 426&lt;/ref&gt; when statute does not provide immunity.&lt;ref&gt;In the UK, [[Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992]]; c.f. in the U.S., [[National Labor Relations Act]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Property law ===
{{Main|Property law}}
[[File:South Sea Bubble.jpg|thumb|A painting of the [[South Sea Bubble]], one of the world's first ever speculations and crashes, led to strict regulation on share trading.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, ''The Bubble Act'', 610–627&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Property]] law governs ownership and possession. [[Real property]], sometimes called 'real estate', refers to ownership of land and things attached to it.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''[[Hunter v Canary Wharf Ltd]]'' [1997] [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199697/ldjudgmt/jd970424/hunter01.htm 2 All ER 426]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Personal property]], refers to everything else; movable objects, such as computers, cars, jewelry or intangible rights, such as [[share (finance)|stocks and shares]]. A right ''[[in rem]]'' is a right to a specific piece of property, contrasting to a right ''[[in personam]]'' which allows compensation for a loss, but not a particular thing back. Land law forms the basis for most kinds of property law, and is the most complex. It concerns [[mortgage law|mortgages]], [[leasehold estate|rental agreements]], [[license|licences]], [[Covenant (law)|covenants]], [[easement]]s and the statutory systems for land registration. Regulations on the use of personal property fall under intellectual property, [[company (law)|company law]], [[trust law|trusts]] and [[commercial law]]. An example of a basic case of most property law is ''[[Armory v Delamirie]]'' [1722].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Armory v Delamirie]]'' (1722) 93 ER 664, 1 Strange 505&lt;/ref&gt; A [[chimney sweep]]'s boy found a jewel encrusted with precious stones. He took it to a goldsmith to have it valued. The goldsmith's apprentice looked at it, sneakily removed the stones, told the boy it was worth three [[Halfpenny (British coin)|halfpence]] and that he would buy it. The boy said he would prefer the jewel back, so the apprentice gave it to him, but without the stones. The boy sued the goldsmith for his apprentice's attempt to cheat him. [[Lord Chief Justice Pratt]] ruled that even though the boy could not be said to own the jewel, he should be considered the rightful keeper ("finders keepers") until the original owner is found. In fact the apprentice and the boy both had a right of ''[[Possession (law)|possession]]'' in the jewel (a technical concept, meaning evidence that something ''could'' belong to someone), but the boy's possessory interest was considered better, because it could be shown to be first in time. Possession may be nine tenths of the law, but not all.

This case is used to support the view of property in common law jurisdictions, that the person who can show the best claim to a piece of property, against any contesting party, is the owner.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, ''The Man of Property'', 251–274&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the classic civil law approach to property, propounded by [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny]], is that it is a right good against the world. Obligations, like contracts and torts, are conceptualised as rights good between individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Savigny, ''Das Recht des Besitzes'', [https://web.archive.org/web/20080418181513/http://dlib-pr.mpier.mpg.de/m/kleioc/0010/exec/bigpage/%22235083_00000057%22 25]&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of property raises many further philosophical and political issues. Locke argued that our "lives, liberties and estates" are our property because we own our bodies and [[Labour theory of property|mix our labour]] with our surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, ''[[s:Two Treatises of Government/The Second Treatise of Government: An Essay Concerning the True Origin, Extent, and End of Civil Government|Second Treatise on Civil Government]]'', Chap. IX. Of the Ends of Political Society and Government. Chapter 9, section 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Equity and trusts ===
{{Main|Equity (law)|Trust law|}}
[[File:Court of Chancery edited.jpg|thumb|The [[Court of Chancery]], London, early 19th century]]

Equity is a body of rules that developed in England separately from the "common law". The common law was administered by judges and barristers. The [[Lord Chancellor]] on the other hand, as the King's keeper of conscience, could overrule the judge-made law if he thought it equitable to do so.&lt;ref&gt;McGhee, ''Snell's Equity'', 7&lt;/ref&gt; This meant equity came to operate more through [[Maxims of equity|principles]] than rigid rules. For instance, whereas neither the common law nor civil law systems allow people to split the ownership from the control of one piece of property, equity allows this through an arrangement known as a 'trust'. 'Trustees' control property, whereas the 'beneficial' (or 'equitable') ownership of trust property is held by people known as 'beneficiaries'. Trustees owe duties to their beneficiaries to take good care of the entrusted property.&lt;ref&gt;c.f. ''[[Bristol and West Building Society v Mothew]]'' [1998] Ch 1&lt;/ref&gt; In the early case of ''[[Keech v Sandford]]'' [1722]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Keech v Sandford]]'' (1726) Sel Cas Ch 61&lt;/ref&gt; a child had inherited the [[lease]] on a [[Romford Market|market]] in [[Romford]], London. Mr Sandford was entrusted to look after this property until the child matured. But before then, the lease expired. The landlord had (apparently) told Mr Sandford that he did not want the child to have the renewed lease. Yet the landlord was happy (apparently) to give Mr Sandford the opportunity of the lease instead. Mr Sandford took it. When the child (now Mr Keech) grew up, he sued Mr Sandford for the profit that he had been making by getting the market's lease. Mr Sandford was meant to be trusted, but he put himself in a position of [[conflict of interest]]. The [[Lord Chancellor]], [[Peter King, 1st Baron King|Lord King]], agreed and ordered Mr Sandford should disgorge his profits. He wrote,

{{quote|I very well see, if a trustee, on the refusal to renew, might have a lease to himself few trust-estates would be renewed … This may seem very hard, that the trustee is the only person of all mankind who might not have the lease; but it is very proper that the rule should be strictly pursued and not at all relaxed.}}

Of course, Lord King LC was worried that trustees might exploit opportunities to use trust property for themselves instead of looking after it. Business speculators using trusts had just recently caused a [[South Sea Bubble|stock market crash]]. Strict duties for trustees made their way into company law and were applied to directors and chief executive officers. Another example of a trustee's duty might be to invest property wisely or sell it.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Nestlé v National Westminster Bank plc]]'' [1993] 1 WLR 1260&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially the case for pension funds, the most important form of trust, where investors are trustees for people's savings until retirement. But trusts can also be set up for [[charitable trust|charitable purposes]], famous examples being the [[British Museum]] or the [[Rockefeller Foundation]].

Law spreads far beyond the core subjects into virtually every area of life. Three categories are presented for convenience, though the subjects intertwine and overlap.

;Law and society
[[File:Unison strike rally Oxford 20060328.jpg|thumb|A trade union protest by [[UNISON]] while on strike]]
* '''[[Labour law]]''' is the study of a tripartite industrial relationship between worker, employer and trade union. This involves [[collective bargaining]] regulation, and the right to strike. Individual employment law refers to workplace rights, such as [[job security]], [[Occupational safety and health|health and safety]] or a [[minimum wage]].
* '''Human rights''', [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] and [[human rights law]] are important fields to guarantee everyone basic freedoms and entitlements. These are laid down in codes such as the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (which founded the [[European Court of Human Rights]]) and the [[United States Bill of Rights|U.S. Bill of Rights]]. The [[Treaty of Lisbon]] makes the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] legally binding in all member states [[Opt-outs in the European Union#Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union – Poland and the United Kingdom|except Poland and the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/documents/downloads/guide_to_treaty_of_lisbon.pdf A Guide to the Treaty of Lisbon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910001253/http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/documents/downloads/guide_to_treaty_of_lisbon.pdf |date=10 September 2008 }}, The Law Society&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Civil procedure]]''' and '''[[criminal procedure]]''' concern the rules that courts must follow as a trial and appeals proceed. Both concern a citizen's [[right to a fair trial]] or hearing.
* '''[[Evidence (law)|Evidence]]''' law involves which materials are admissible in courts for a case to be built.
* '''[[Immigration law]]''' and '''[[nationality law]]''' concern the rights of foreigners to live and work in a nation-state that is not their own and to acquire or lose [[citizenship]]. Both also involve the [[right of asylum]] and the problem of [[statelessness|stateless]] individuals.
* '''[[Social security]]''' law refers to the rights people have to social insurance, such as jobseekers' allowances or housing benefits.
* '''[[Family law]]''' covers marriage and divorce proceedings, the rights of children and rights to property and money in the event of separation.
* '''[[Transactional law]]''' refers to the practice of law concerning business and money.

;Law and commerce
* '''[[Company law]]''' sprang from the law of trusts, on the principle of separating ownership of property and control.&lt;ref&gt;Berle, ''Modern Corporation and Private Property''&lt;/ref&gt; The law of the modern [[company (law)|company]] began with the [[Joint Stock Companies Act 1856]], passed in the United Kingdom, which provided investors with a simple registration procedure to gain [[limited liability]] under the [[Juristic person|separate legal personality]] of the corporation.
* '''[[Commercial law]]''' covers complex contract and property law. The law of [[agency (law)|agency]], [[insurance law]], [[negotiable instrument|bills of exchange]], [[insolvency]] and [[bankruptcy law]] and sales law are all important, and trace back to the medieval ''[[Law Merchant|Lex Mercatoria]]''. The UK [[Sale of Goods Act 1979]] and the US [[Uniform Commercial Code]] are examples of codified common law commercial principles.
* '''[[Admiralty law]]''' and the '''[[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|Law of the Sea]]''' lay a basic framework for free trade and commerce across the world's oceans and seas, where outside of a country's zone of control. Shipping companies operate through ordinary principles of commercial law, generalised for a global market. Admiralty law also encompasses specialised issues such as [[marine salvage|salvage]], [[Lien#Maritime liens|maritime liens]], and injuries to passengers.
* '''[[Intellectual property law]]''' aims at safeguarding creators and other producers of intellectual goods and services. These are legal rights ([[copyright]]s, trademarks, patents, and [[related right]]s) which result from intellectual activity in the industrial, literary and artistic fields.&lt;ref&gt;WIPO, ''Intellectual Property'', 3&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Restitution]]''' deals with the recovery of someone else's gain, rather than [[Damages|compensation]] for one's own loss.
* '''[[Unjust enrichment]]''' When someone has been unjustly enriched (or there is an "absence of basis" for a transaction) at another's expense, this event generates the right to restitution to reverse that gain.
* '''[[Space law]]''' is a relatively new field dealing with aspects of international law regarding human activities in Earth orbit and outer space.  While at first addressing space relations of countries via treaties, increasingly it is addressing areas such as [[commercialization of space|space commercialisation]], property, liability, and other issues.

;Law and regulation
[[File:1930-67B.png|thumb|The [[New York Stock Exchange]] trading floor after the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], before tougher [[banking regulation]] was introduced]]
* '''[[Tax law]]''' involves regulations that concern [[value added tax]], [[corporate tax]], and [[income tax]].
* '''[[Bank regulation|Banking law]]''' and [[financial regulation]] set minimum standards on the amounts of capital banks must hold, and rules about best practice for investment. This is to insure against the risk of economic crises, such as the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]].
* '''Regulation''' deals with the provision of [[public services]] and utilities. '''[[Water law]]''' is one example. Especially since [[privatization|privatisation]] became popular and took management of services away from public law, private companies doing the jobs previously controlled by government have been bound by varying degrees of social responsibility. [[Energy policy|Energy]], [[Ofgem|gas]], [[telecommunication policy|telecomms]] and [[water law|water]] are regulated industries in most [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] countries.
* '''[[Competition law]]''', known in the U.S. as [[antitrust]] law, is an evolving field that traces as far back as [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] decrees against [[price fixing]] and the English [[restraint of trade]] doctrine. Modern competition law derives from the U.S. anti-cartel and anti-monopoly statutes (the [[Sherman Act]] and [[Clayton Act]]) of the turn of the 20th century. It is used to control businesses who attempt to use their economic influence to distort market prices at the expense of [[consumer welfare]].
* '''[[Consumer protection|Consumer law]]''' could include anything from regulations on unfair [[contractual terms]] and clauses to directives on airline baggage insurance.
* '''[[Environmental law]]''' is increasingly important, especially in light of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] and the potential danger of [[climate change]]. Environmental protection also serves to penalise [[pollution|polluters]] within domestic legal systems.

{{multiple issues|{{Tone|date=July 2008}}
{{primary sources|date=August 2008}}}}

The terms '''legal case management''' ('''LCM''') or '''matter management''' refer to a subset of [[law]] practice management and cover a range of approaches and technologies used by law firms and courts to leverage [[knowledge]] and methodologies for managing the life cycle of a case or matter more effectively.&lt;ref&gt;In the U.S., the term 'case' is customarily applied to a matter in which there are opposing parties or which involves a conflict between parties ''Capturing More Time ... And Keeping Your Clients Happy While Doing It'', Law Practice Today, March 2007.[http://www.abanet.org/lpm/lpt/articles/bot03071.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, the terms refer to the sophisticated information management and workflow practices that are tailored to meet the legal field's specific needs and requirements.

As attorneys and law firms compete for clients they are routinely challenged to deliver services at lower costs with greater efficiency, thus firms develop practice-specific processes and utilize contemporary technologies to assist in meeting such challenges. Law practice management processes and technologies include case and matter management, time and billing, litigation support, research, communication and collaboration, [[data mining]] and modeling, and [[data security]], storage, and archive accessibility.

==Case management software==
Legal case or matter management software has two primary functions: it helps to better use, manage, consolidate, share, and protect information, and it tracks and shapes the business process. Because the most useful forms of such software can integrate data from multiple systems, departments, users, and business entities, its use can increase a firm's business advantage.

Case or matter management systems having the capacity to push and pull data over the Internet, whether within the software itself or within an integrated software framework or environment became an industry standard with the advent of the [[LexisNexis|Lexis]] and [[Westlaw]] legal research platforms.

Case management software is marketed to specific segments of the legal marketplace, with some products designed for small firms and others for large multinational firms, and a few claim to be scalable to all. Cost-containment and competition concerns facing small-to-mid-size firms that cannot afford a full-time IT staff often drive custom solutions incorporating muliple integrated products.

==In-house legal departments==
In-house legal teams (in the public and private sectors) have their own needs: generally these require less emphasis on billing and accounts (since clients tend to be internal), and even more on traceability, real-time integration and configurability. The need to improve productivity of the team and reduce costs to taxpayers, or the business, is often a key driver.  Some in-house teams have reduced their external legal bills by using case management software to increase their capacity and bring case work in-house.&lt;ref&gt;Kate Teh, Telegraph Media Group on [http://www.iken.biz www.iken.biz] January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case management in the U.S. federal courts==
As electronic court systems continue to increase their online presence, many now require case filings to be accomplished electronically.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., News Release, ''Electronic Case Filing in Federal Courts Reaches Milestone'', November 21, 2005.{{cite web |url=http://www.uscourts.gov/Press_Releases/cmecfat10.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515005302/http://www.uscourts.gov/Press_Releases/cmecfat10.html |archivedate=2009-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Courts, ''About Case Management/Electronic Case Files (CM/ECF)'', July 2009.{{cite web |url=http://www.uscourts.gov/cmecf/cmecf_about.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090602021153/http://www.uscourts.gov/cmecf/cmecf_about.html |archivedate=2009-06-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many legal software vendors' products include the ability to take advantage of such electronic filing by pulling data from the case management product and pushing it into court filing systems.

==e-Discovery systems==
In litigation, the discovery process often results in enormous amounts of information that must be managed, and with the revision of the U.S. [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] in 2006 to include electronic means of discovery&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/#chapter_v FRCP]&lt;/ref&gt; came a new subset of case management systems that incorporated those changes, often dubbed 'electronic evidence' or 'e-discovery' management systems.&lt;ref&gt;See Kaplan, ''Industry Research Report, A Conversation with Corporate Counsel: e-Discovery Trends and Perspectives'', Fios, Inc. and Ari Kaplan Advisors, 2008.[http://www.abanet.org/lpm/lpt/docs/LPT608AriKaplan-ResearchStudy.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abanet.org/lpm/lpt/articles/tch04081.shtml Blake, ''Are You Litigation-Ready?'', Law Practice Today, April 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the new rules took effect, e-Discovery firms as outside service vendors have flourished.

== Case management and the regulation of mediation in Australia ==
The term '''case management''' is also used to refer to systems in which court or tribunal officials assume closer administrative control over the litigation process than is traditionally associated with [[common law]] [[litigation]].&lt;ref name="Boulle"&gt;Boulle, L. (2005). Mediation: Principles Process Practice. 2nd Edition. Queensland, Australia. LexisNexis Butterworths.&lt;/ref&gt; The Assisted Dispute Resolution program was introduced into the [[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court]] in 1990 after a number of cases failed to reach resolutions having several directional hearings. In those cases the parties were not able to isolate the issues requiring determination. With the new program, judges can refer the parties to a court registrar for mediation. This is stated in the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 Section 53A(1):&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/s53a.html|title=Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) s 53A|last=|first=|date=|website=www.austlii.edu.au|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504050856/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fcoaa1976249/s53a.html|archive-date=2007-05-04|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|(1)  Subject to the Rules of Court, the Court may by order refer the proceedings in the Court, or any part of them or any matter arising out of them, to a mediator or an arbitrator for mediation or arbitration, as the case may be, in accordance with the Rules of Court. 

(1A)  Referrals under subsection (1) to a mediator may be made with or without the consent of the parties to the proceedings. However, referrals to an arbitrator may be made only with the consent of the parties.}} 

Case management in the State of New South Wales includes governing civil court proceedings by court management rules, which are the ''Civil Procedure Act 2005'' (NSW)[http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/#/view/act/2005/28/full] and ''Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005'' (NSW)[http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/#/view/regulation/2005/418/full]. The overriding purpose of case management in the ''Civil Procedure Act 2005'' is 'to facilitate the just, quick and cheap resolution' to the matter at dispute in the civil court proceedings (s56(1), ''Civil Procedure Act 2005'' (NSW) [http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/#/view/act/2005/28/part6/div1/sec56]).

In Australia, mediation as an [[alternative dispute resolution]] (ADR) method is designed to avoid resorting to formal court-based adjudication and is now also being applied to criminal matters. Traditional theories of criminal justice view the matter as one between the offender and the state.&lt;ref&gt;Sarre, R. and Earle, K. (2004). Restorative Justice in Key Issues in Criminal Justice Sarre R, and Tomaino, J. (eds) Key Issues in Criminal Justice, Adelaide: Australian Humanities Press&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not necessary to have the parties consent to the mediation process and a judge can direct the mediation. In this sense, case management is designed to identify and define issues in dispute and to reduce delays, costs and unnecessary pre-trial activities. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;[W]hat was born of resistance and opposition to the formal justice system has been extensively integrated and co-opted into the system.&lt;ref&gt;Astor, H &amp; Chinkin, C. M. (2nd Edition, 2002). Dispute Resolution in Australia. Sydney Australia.. LexisNexis Butterworths&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Legal executives''' are a form of trained persons in the legal professional in certain jurisdictions. They often specialise in a particular area of [[law]]. The training that a  Legal Executive undertakes usually includes both vocational training (a minimum of 3 years for those in England and Wales) and academic qualifications.

Legal executives are associated with different membership bodies and different rights according to geographical regions. Legal executives are recognised in both [[Northern Ireland]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]], [[Singapore]],  [[Hong Kong]] and The Bahamas. There is no direct equivalent to a legal executive in [[Scotland]]. In England and Wales they hold Chartered status and are members of the Chartered Institute of Legal Executives (CILEx).

==England and Wales==
Chartered Legal Executives in England and Wales are lawyers.  They can become partners in law firms and are eligible to become judges and advocates subject to meeting eligibility requirements. As lawyers, they are subject to stringent regulation and a code of ethics as with barristers and solicitors.

Chartered Legal Executives (formerly known as Fellows of CILEx) qualify after completing their CILEX training followed by a minimum of 3 years qualifying employment. Chartered Legal Executives may do a wide range of legal work although, like solicitors, they generally specialise in one area:

* residential and commercial [[conveyancing]]
* [[will (law)|wills]] probate work and [[trusts]]
* personal injury
* family law
* criminal law
* employment law
* immigration law
* [[litigation]]
* practice management
 
After completing their academic training, trainee Legal Executives often occupy paralegal roles to satisfy the 3 year vocational stage of qualifying as Chartered Legal Executives.

===History===
The modern chartered legal executive evolved from the 19th-century managing clerk. When solicitor firms started to grow in the 19th century, they increasingly relied on an ever-expanding number of law clerks for drafting and organizing documents.  Some of these clerks in turn became knowledgeable about the law and were allowed to manage their fellow clerks; hence, they were called managing clerks.

In the 1950s and 1960s England suffered a shortage of solicitors when [[Post-World War II baby boom|population growth]] unexpectedly exceeded the number of entrants into the profession.  To improve the availability of legal services, the Law Society began aggressive recruitment efforts to convince young people to choose law as a career.  As part of this effort, the Law Society decided to turn the managing clerk into a true legal profession of its own and sponsored the ILEX's creation in 1963 as well as the change in title to legal executive. In the Law Society's own words, ILEX was intended "to stimulate recruitment to the unadmitted ranks of the professional status [...] and would offer [...] a career with proper incentives."&lt;ref&gt;Brian Abel-Smith and Robert Stevens, ''Lawyers and the Courts: A Sociological Study of the English Legal System, 1750-1965'' (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1967), 397.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute of Legal Executives was granted a royal charter to chartered professional body status in October 2011 and on 30 January 2012, officially received its charter, from the Minister of Justice, Jonathan Djanogly and was officially launched as the 'Chartered Institute of Legal Executives'.

===CILEx===
The Chartered [[Institute of Legal Executives]] (CILEx) was founded in 1892 as the Solicitors Managing Clerks' Association and became the Institute of Legal Executives, a company limited by guarantee, in 1963 with the support of the [[Law Society of England and Wales]].  In England and Wales the Institute of Legal Executives received a Royal Charter in early 2012 to become the Chartered Institute of Legal Executives (CILEx). Fully qualified members of CILEx in England and Wales are now therefore referred to as "Chartered Legal Executives".

CILEx is a professional body which represents Chartered legal executive lawyers and other legal practitioners and law staff. It has around 20,000 members.  All members of CILEx are independently regulated by ILEX Professional Standards (IPS), regardless of grade.

To qualify as a Chartered Legal Executive, aspiring Chartered Legal Executives undertake a series of training courses and are required to pass qualifications relevant to the area of practice in which they intend to specialise. The first stage for the full vocational route to qualifying is called the CILEx Level 3 Professional Diploma in Law and Practice&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cilex.org.uk/study/lawyer_qualifications/level_3_qualifications/diploma_in_law_and_practice.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; and is set at the equivalent to A-level law. The second and final qualifications are equivalent to an honours degree course - the CILEx Level 6 Diploma in Law and Practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cilex.org.uk/study/lawyer_qualifications/level_6_qualifications/level_6_diploma_law__practice.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; Trainees will often work at the same time as studying in order to acquire practical skills. The courses can be undertaken at a college, university or through an open learning programme. The courses are open to graduates and non-graduates.

A trainee must also gain 3 years' vocational experience before being admitted as a Fellow.

====Membership Grades====

=====Fellows=====
Only Fellows of CILEx (FCILEx) can lawfully hold themselves out as Chartered Legal Executives and are qualified by law (by way of CILEx) to be [[commissioner of oaths|commissioners of oaths]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cilex.org.uk/professional_issues/comm_oaths.asp]&lt;/ref&gt; able to take [[Deposition (law)|depositions]] and [[affidavits]]. Fellows also can bring action in [[court]] and appear for clients in certain courts. Appearance in courts requires a separate CILEx qualification to become a Chartered Legal Executive Advocate.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cilex.org.uk/about_cilex_lawyers/cilex_advocates.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Fellows (that is, Chartered Legal Executives) are also eligible to apply and compete with barristers and solicitors for appointment to certain judicial offices, such as the position of deputy or district judge.

=====Membership levels=====
In September 2009, the CILEx training in England and Wales changed.  The CILEx qualification now emphasises and examines the practical work of the law as well as continuing with the necessary academic examinations. At the same time, a number of new membership grades were introduced by CILEx. CILEx now offers the following membership categories which can be joined according to experience and qualifications held:

*student member - for those wishing to enter the legal profession, who have no relevant legal qualification, or those with less than three years’ work experience of a predominantly legal nature. 
*affiliate member - for those with at least one CILEx level-3 unit-qualifications, or who have completed a relevant level-2 legal qualification, or gained at least three years’ work of a predominantly legal nature. 
*associate member – for those who have completed their CILEx level-3 Professional Diploma in Law and Practice (the first stage of CILEx qualifications), or who are graduates with qualifying law degrees. Associate members will be entitled to use the designatory letters ACILEx after their name and be required to undertake [[continuing professional development]] (CPD). 
*graduate member - for those who have completed both their CILEx level-3 Professional Diploma in Law and Practice and their CILEx level-6 Professional Higher Diploma in Law and Practice (including the CILEx Graduate ‘Fast-Track’ Diploma,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cilex.org.uk/study/lawyer_qualifications/graduate_fast_track_diploma.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; or who are Legal Practice Course (LPC) or Bar Vocational Course (BVC) graduates. Graduate members will be entitled to use the designatory letters GCILEx after their name and be required to undertake CPD.

Students already holding a [[Legal Practice Course]] (LPC) or [[Bar Professional Training Course]] (BPTC) qualifications are exempt from the CILEx academic qualifications and can immediately apply to become a graduate member. Graduate members must then work under the supervision of a qualified legal executive or a solicitor at a firm, either in-house at a private company or in government (provided their work is substantially of a legal rather than administrative nature). To apply to become a Fellow of the Chartered Institute they must have a minimum of three years' practical legal experience.

Once a student has successfully completed a period of qualifying employment, he or she will become a Fellow of CILEx, a qualified lawyer and will be allowed to hold themselves out as a Chartered Legal Executive and use the designatory letters FCILEx. Fellows (and other member grades) are required to maintain and improve their knowledge by undertaking CPD each year.  A proportion of those hours must relate to their area of specialism.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cilex.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt; Fellows are issued an annual practising certificate. Only qualified and practicing Fellows of the Chartered Institute of Legal Executives may use the designatory title 'Chartered Legal Executives' which is a protected designation for practicing Fellows under its Royal Charter.

A CILEx Fellow who wishes to go on to qualify as a solicitor is usually allowed to forego the training contract aspect. For this exemption to apply, they must have attained fellowship level by the time they complete the vocational stage of solicitor training, i.e. the LPC. It goes without saying they must also have completed the academic stage; however, having come through the CILEx route to qualification, this usually means taking advanced modules of the CILEx level-6 qualification.

==Other Jurisdictions==

===Australia===
The Institute of Legal Executives (Victoria) was set up in 1966 and represents legal executives in the state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], it works with the Institute of Legal Executives (Australia) which was formed in 1994 and represents legal executives in the rest of Australia. Both Legal Executives organisations in Australia work to formalise legal training and promote education for the position of Legal Executive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liv.asn.au/legalexecutives/index.html About the Institute of Legal Executives Australia]&lt;/ref&gt; They award Diplomas, Certificates in Professional Legal studies, as well as prizes and bursaries for students.
In South Australia the law society provides an equivalent association for paralegals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawsocietysa.asn.au/ Law Society of South Australia]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong===
The Law Society of Hong Kong set benchmark standards for those using the title 'legal executive' in Hong Kong.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hklawsoc.org.hk/pub_e/circular/12-349a1.pdf|title=Benchmarks for Legal Executive Courses|last=Law Society of Hong Kong|first=|date=December 2011|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; HKUSPACE (an extension of the University of Hong Kong) runs two programs to meet the Law Society of Hong Kong benchmarks&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hkuspace.hku.hk/prog/cls|title=Certificate in Legal Studies - HKU SPACE: Common Law, Professional Legal Studies courses|website=hkuspace.hku.hk|language=en|access-date=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hkuspace-plk.hku.hk/programme/detail/higher-diploma-for-legal-executives|title=HKU SPACE Po Leung Kuk Stanley Ho Community College|website=hkuspace-plk.hku.hk|access-date=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Legal executive may be given certain limited rights of audience in accordance with the Court’s Practice Direction to represent lay clients.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Republic of Ireland===
The Irish Institute of Legal Executives [[IILEX]] is the professional body representing legal executives in Ireland and with the stated aim to provide a system of training and examination and to obtain a recognised professional qualification for those engaged in legal work in Ireland.

====Categories of IILEX Membership====
*Senior Legal Executive Member S.I.I.L.Ex.
*Legal Executive Member M.I.I.L.Ex.
*Associate Member ACILEx
*Student Legal Executive Member &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishinstituteoflegalexecutives.com/members.html Categories of IILEX Membership] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106183258/http://www.irishinstituteoflegalexecutives.com/members.html |date=2009-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
The New Zealand Institute of Legal Executives&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzile.org.nz]&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[incorporated society]] which advances and protects the status and interests of legal executives. At present it has approximately 650 members.

===The Bahamas===
In The Bahamas, Legal Executives, like other members of the legal profession, are governed by and regulated in accordance with the provisions of the Legal Profession Act. The Legal Profession Act tasks the Registrar of the Supreme Court of the Commonwealth of The Bahamas with keeping a register which is known simply as the Register of Legal Executives.

Whereas Legal Executives practising in England and Wales now enjoy certain rights of audience, in The Bahamas, Legal Executives may only appear before a particular tribunal or authority after the attorney-general has had consultations with the Bar Council of the Bahamas Bar Association.

In The Bahamas, under the Legal Profession Act, it is unlawful for a person to hold himself or herself out as a Legal Executive if their name does not appear on the Register of Legal Executives. Any person who is found to be guilty of pretending to be a Legal Executive can be liable upon conviction to a fine of B$5,000.00, or imprisonment for a period of three years, or both.

'''Legal history''' or the '''history of law''' is the study of how [[law]] has evolved and why it changed. Legal history is closely connected to the development of [[civilisations]] and is set in the wider context of [[social history]]. Among certain jurists and historians of legal process, it has been seen as the recording of the evolution of laws and the technical explanation of how these laws have evolved with the view of better understanding the origins of various legal concepts; some consider it a branch of [[intellectual history]]. Twentieth century [[historian]]s have viewed legal history in a more contextualised manner more in line with the thinking of [[Social history|social historians]]. They have looked at legal institutions as complex systems of rules, players and symbols and have seen these elements interact with society to change, adapt, resist or promote certain aspects of [[civil society]]. Such legal historians have tended to analyse case histories from the parameters of [[social science]] inquiry, using statistical methods, analysing class distinctions among litigants, petitioners and other players in various legal processes. By analysing case outcomes, transaction costs, number of settled cases they have begun an analysis of legal institutions, practices, procedures and briefs that give us a more complex picture of law and [[society]] than the study of [[jurisprudence]], [[case law]] and [[civil code]]s can achieve.

==Ancient world==
{{Main|Ma'at|Babylonian law|Ancient Greek law|Leviticus}}
{{See also|Urukagina|Hittite laws|Ostracism}}
[[Ancient Egypt]]ian law, dating as far back as 3000 BC, had a civil code that was probably broken into twelve books. It was based on the concept of [[Ma'at]], characterised by tradition, [[rhetoric]]al speech, social equality and impartiality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Théodoridés|title = law | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt}}&lt;br/&gt;* VerSteeg, ''Law in ancient Egypt''&lt;/ref&gt; By the 22nd century BC, [[Ur-Nammu]], an ancient [[Sumer]]ian ruler, formulated the first extant [[Code of Ur-Nammu|law code]], consisting of casuistic statements ("if... then..."). Around 1760 BC, [[Hammurabi|King Hammurabi]] further developed [[Babylonian law]], by codifying and inscribing it in stone. Hammurabi placed several copies of his law code throughout the kingdom of Babylon as [[stelae]], for the entire public to see; this became known as the [[Code of Hammurabi|Codex Hammurabi]]. The most intact copy of these stelae was discovered in the 19th century by British Assyriologists, and has since been fully [[transliterated]] and translated into various languages, including English, German and French. Ancient Greek has no word for "law" as an abstract concept,&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, ''A Short History of Western Legal Theory'', 5-6&lt;/ref&gt; retaining instead the distinction between divine law (''thémis''), human decree (''nomos'') and custom (''díkē'').&lt;ref&gt;J.P. Mallory, "Law", in ''Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture'', 346&lt;/ref&gt; Yet [[Ancient Greek law]] contained major [[Constitution of the Athenians (Aristotle)|constitutional]] innovations in the development of [[democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Ober, ''The Nature of Athenian Democracy'', 121&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ancient India]] and [[Ancient China|China]] represent distinct traditions of law, and had historically independent schools of legal theory and practice. The ''[[Arthashastra]]'', dating from the 400 BC, and the ''[[Manusmriti]]'' from 100 BCE&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Study reveals origin of India’s caste system|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Study-reveals-origin-of-Indias-caste-system/articleshow/21754499.cms}}&lt;/ref&gt; were influential treatises in India, texts that were considered authoritative legal guidance.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 255&lt;/ref&gt; Manu's central philosophy was tolerance and pluralism, and was cited across South East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 276&lt;/ref&gt; But this Hindu tradition, along with Islamic law, was  supplanted by the common law when India became part of the [[British Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 273&lt;/ref&gt; Malaysia, Brunei, Singapore and [[Law of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] also adopted the common law.

==Eastern Asia==
{{Main|Traditional Chinese law|Tang Code|Great Qing Legal Code}}
The eastern Asia legal tradition reflects a unique blend of secular and religious influences.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 287&lt;/ref&gt; Japan was the first country to begin modernising its legal system along western lines, by importing bits of the [[Code Civil|French]], but mostly the [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|German]] Civil Code.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 304&lt;/ref&gt; This partly reflected Germany's status as a rising power in the late nineteenth century. Similarly, [[traditional Chinese law]] gave way to westernisation towards the final years of the [[Qing Dynasty|Qing dynasty]] in the form of six private law codes based mainly on the Japanese model of German law.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 305&lt;/ref&gt; Today Taiwanese law retains the closest affinity to the codifications from that period, because of the split between [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s nationalists, who fled there, and [[Mao Zedong]]'s communists who won control of the mainland in 1949. The current legal infrastructure in the [[People's Republic of China]] was heavily influenced by soviet [[Socialist law]], which essentially inflates administrative law at the expense of private law  rights.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 307&lt;/ref&gt; Today, however, because of rapid industrialisation China has been reforming, at least in terms of economic (if not social and political) rights. A new contract code in 1999 represented a turn away from administrative domination.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 309&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, after negotiations lasting fifteen years, in 2001 China joined the [[World Trade Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;Farah, ''Five Years of China WTO Membership'', 263-304&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canon law==
{{canon law}}
{{main|Legal history of the Catholic Church}}
{{further|Canon law (Catholic Church)}}
The legal history of the [[Catholic Church]] is the history of [[canon law (Catholic Church)|Catholic canon law]], the oldest continuously functioning legal system in the West.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dr. Edward N. Peters]], [http://www.canonlaw.info CanonLaw.info], accessed Jul-1-2013&lt;/ref&gt; Canon law originates much later than [[Roman law]] but predates the evolution of modern European [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] traditions. The cultural exchange between the secular (Roman/Barbarian) and ecclesiastical (canon) law produced the [[jus commune]] and greatly influenced both civil and common law.

The history of Latin [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] can be divided into four periods: the ''jus antiquum'', the ''jus novum'', the ''jus novissimum'' and the ''Code of Canon Law''.&lt;ref name=Manual13&gt;Manual of Canon Law, pg. 13, #8&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to the Code, history can be divided into the ''jus vetus'' (all law before the Code) and the ''jus novum'' (the law of the Code, or ''jus codicis'').&lt;ref name=Manual13/&gt; Eastern canon law developed separately.

In the twentieth century, canon law was comprehensively codified. On 27 May 1917, Pope Benedict XV codified the [[1917 Code of Canon Law]]. John XIII, together with his intention to call the [[Second Vatican Council]], announced his intention to reform canon law, which culminated in the [[1983 Code of Canon Law]], promulgated by [[John Paul II]] on 25 January 1983. John Paul II also brought to a close the long process of codifying the legal elements common to all 23 [[sui juris]] Eastern Catholic Churches on 18 October 1990 by promulgating the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches.

==Islamic law==
{{Main|Sharia}}
{{See also|Fiqh|Islamic ethics|Early reforms under Islam}}
One of the major legal systems developed during the Middle Ages was [[Sharia|Islamic law]] and [[Fiqh|jurisprudence]]. A number of important legal institutions were developed by [[Ulema|Islamic jurists]] during the classical period of [[Sharia|Islamic law]] and [[Fiqh|jurisprudence]]. One such institution was the ''[[Hawala]]'', an early [[informal value transfer system]], which is mentioned in texts of [[Fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]] as early as the 8th century. ''Hawala'' itself later influenced the development of the ''Aval'' in [[French civil law]] and the ''Avallo'' in Italian law.&lt;ref name=Badr&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Islamic Law: Its Relation to Other Legal Systems|first=Gamal Moursi|last=Badr|journal=The American Journal of Comparative Law|volume=26|issue=2 [Proceedings of an International Conference on Comparative Law, Salt Lake City, Utah, February 24–25, 1977]|date=Spring 1978|pages=187–198 [196–8]|doi=10.2307/839667|publisher=American Society of Comparative Law|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|jstor=839667}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==European laws==
===Roman Empire===
{{Main|Roman law|Byzantine law}}
[[Roman law]] was heavily influenced by Greek teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, ''A Short History of Western Legal Theory, 39&lt;/ref&gt; It forms the bridge to the modern legal world, over the centuries between the rise and decline of the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name="BrRL"&gt;As a legal system, Roman law has affected the development of law in most of [[Western world|Western civilization]] as well as in parts of the [[Eastern world]]. It also forms the basis for the law codes of most countries of continental Europe ({{cite encyclopedia|title=Roman law|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Roman law, in the days of the [[Roman republic]] and [[Roman empire|Empire]], was heavily procedural and there was no professional legal class.&lt;ref&gt;Gordley-von Mehren, ''Comparative Study of Private Law'', 18&lt;/ref&gt; Instead a lay person, ''iudex'', was chosen to adjudicate. Precedents were not reported, so any case law that developed was disguised and almost unrecognised.&lt;ref&gt;Gordley-von Mehren, ''Comparative Study of Private Law'', 21&lt;/ref&gt; Each case was to be decided afresh from the laws of the state, which mirrors the (theoretical) unimportance of judges' decisions for future cases in civil law systems today. During the 6th century AD in the Eastern Roman Empire, the Emperor [[Justinian]] codified and consolidated the laws that had existed in Rome so that what remained was one twentieth of the mass of legal texts from before.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, ''Roman Law in European History'', 32&lt;/ref&gt; This became known as the ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]''. As one legal historian wrote, "Justinian consciously looked back to the golden age of Roman law and aimed to restore it to the peak it had reached three centuries before."&lt;ref&gt;Stein, ''Roman Law in European History'', 35&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Byzantine Empire]] the [[Justinian Code]] was expanded and remained in force until the Empire fell, though it was never officially introduced to the West. Instead, following the fall of the Western Empire and in former Roman countries, the ruling classes relied on the [[Theodosian Code]] to govern natives and Germanic [[custom (law)|customary]] law for the Germanic incomers - a system known as folk-right - until the two laws blended together. Since the Roman court system had broken down, legal disputes were adjudicated according to Germanic custom by assemblies of learned [[lawspeaker]]s in rigid ceremonies and in oral proceedings that relied heavily on [[testimony]].

After much of the West was consolidated under [[Charlemagne]], law became centralized so as to strengthen the royal court system, and consequently [[case law]], and abolished folk-right. However, once Charlemagne's kingdom definitively splintered, Europe became feudalistic, and law was generally not governed above the county, municipal or lordship level, thereby creating a highly decentralized legal culture that favored the development of customary law founded on localized case law. However, in the 11th century, [[crusades|crusaders]], having pillaged the Byzantine Empire, returned with Byzantine legal texts including the Justinian Code, and scholars at the [[University of Bologna]] were the first to use them to interpret their own customary laws.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, ''Roman Law in European History'', 43&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval European legal scholars began researching the [[Roman law]] and using its concepts&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.cua.edu/pennington/Law508/histlaw.htm Roman and Secular Law in the Middle Ages] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927014718/http://faculty.cua.edu/pennington/Law508/histlaw.htm |date=2011-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and prepared the way for the partial resurrection of Roman law as the modern [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] in a large part of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1E1-Romanlaw.html Roman law]&lt;/ref&gt; There was, however, a great deal of resistance so that civil law rivaled customary law for much of the late Middle Ages.

After the [[Norman conquest of England]], which introduced [[Norman law|Norman]] legal concepts into medieval England, the English King's powerful judges developed a body of [[precedent]] that became the [[common law]].&lt;ref name=Makdisi&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Makdisi|first=John A.|title=The Islamic Origins of the Common Law|journal=[[North Carolina Law Review]]|date=June 1999|volume=77|issue=5|pages=1635–1739|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}} suggests that there may have been some importation of Islamic concepts as well, but others have shown that occasional similarities are more likely coincidence than causal.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] instituted legal reforms and developed a system of royal courts administered by a small number of judges who lived in [[Westminster]] and traveled throughout the kingdom.&lt;ref name=KlermanMahoney/&gt; Henry II also instituted the [[Assize of Clarendon]] in 1166, which allowed for jury trials and reduced the number of [[trial by combat|trials by combat]]. [[Louis IX]] of France also undertook major legal reforms and, inspired by [[ecclesiastical court]] procedure, extended Canon-law evidence and [[inquisitorial system|inquisitorial-trial]] systems to the royal courts. Also, judges no longer moved on circuits becoming fixed to their jurisdictions, and jurors were nominated by parties to the legal dispute rather than by the sheriff.&lt;ref name=KlermanMahoney&gt;{{cite journal | author = Klerman D, Mahoney PG | title = Legal Origins | url = http://lawweb.usc.edu/users/dklerman/documents/Klerman.LegalOrigin.JCompEcon.pdf | year = 2007 | journal = Journal of Comparative Economics | pages = 278–293 | volume = 35 | issue = 2 | accessdate = 2009-09-04 | doi = 10.1016/j.jce.2007.03.007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090826025347/http://lawweb.usc.edu/users/dklerman/documents/Klerman.LegalOrigin.JCompEcon.pdf | archive-date = 2009-08-26 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, by the 10th century, the [[lex mercatoria|Law Merchant]], first founded on [[medieval Scandinavian laws|Scandinavian]] trade customs, then solidified by the [[Hanseatic League]], took shape so that merchants could trade using familiar standards, rather than the many splintered types of local law. A precursor to modern commercial law, the Law Merchant emphasised the freedom of contract and alienability of property.&lt;ref&gt;Sealey-Hooley, ''Commercial Law'', 14&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern European law===
{{Main|Napoleonic code|Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|English law|Francisco de Vitoria}}
The two main traditions of modern European law are the codified legal systems of most of continental Europe, and the English tradition based on case law.

As [[nationalism]] grew in the 18th and 19th centuries, ''lex mercatoria'' was incorporated into countries' local law under new civil codes. Of these, the French [[Napoleonic Code]] and the German [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch]] became the most influential. As opposed to English [[common law]], which consists of massive tomes of case law, codes in small books are easy to export and for judges to apply. However, today there are signs that civil and common law are converging. [[European Union law]] is codified in treaties, but develops through the [[precedent]] set down by the [[European Court of Justice]].

==United States==
The [[Law of the United States|United States legal system]] developed primarily out of the English common law system (with the exception of the state of [[Louisiana]], which continued to [[Louisiana law|follow the French civilian system]] after being admitted to statehood).  Some concepts from [[Law of Spain|Spanish law]], such as the [[prior appropriation doctrine]] and [[community property]], still persist in some US states, particularly those that were part of the [[Mexican Cession]] in 1848.

Under the doctrine of [[Federalism in the United States|federalism]], each state has its own [[State court (United States)|separate court system]], and the ability to legislate within areas not reserved to the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]].

Legal Tech companies are generally [[startup companies|startups]] founded with the purpose of [[disruptive innovation|disrupting]] the traditionally conservative legal market.&lt;ref name="LawTechToday"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goodman|first1=Bob|title=Four Areas of Legal Ripe for Disruption by Smart Startups|url=http://www.lawtechnologytoday.org/2014/12/smart-startups/|accessdate=1 May 2015|publisher=Law Technology Today|date=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[TechCrunch]], as of December 2014, "legal technology is booming, with companies attempting to disrupt the legal space at every level and from every angle"&lt;ref name="TechCrunch1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rubin|first1=Basha|title=Legal Tech Startups Have A Short History And A Bright Future|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/12/06/legal-tech-startups-have-a-short-history-and-a-bright-future/|accessdate=1 May 2015|publisher=TechCrunch|date=6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Forbes]] noted in February 2015 that there were “hundreds of legal startups popping up all over the US and Europe”.&lt;ref name="Forbes1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Juetten|first1=Mary|title=The Future Of Legal Tech: It's Not As Scary As Lawyers Think|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/maryjuetten/2015/02/19/legal-tech-or-tech-legal/|accessdate=1 May 2015|publisher=Forbes|date=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
Legal technology traditionally referred to the application of technology and software to help law firms with [[legal matter management|practice management]], [[document management system|document storage]], [[invoicing|billing]], [[accounting]] and [[electronic discovery]].&lt;ref name="lawinsider"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hibnick|first1=Eva|title=What is Legal Tech?|url=http://www.thelawinsider.com/insider-news/what-is-legal-tech|accessdate=1 May 2015|publisher=The Law Insider|date=7 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2011, Legal Tech has evolved to be associated more with technology startups disrupting the [[practice of law]] by giving people access to online software that reduces or in some cases eliminates the need to consult a lawyer, or by connecting people with lawyers more efficiently through online marketplaces and lawyer-matching websites.&lt;ref name="TechCrunch1"/&gt;

==Industry context==
The legal industry is widely seen to be conservative and traditional, with Law Technology Today noting that "in 50 years, the customer experience at most law firms has barely changed".&lt;ref name="LawTechToday"/&gt;  Reasons for this include the fact law firms face weaker cost-cutting incentives than other professions (since they pass disbursements directly to their client) and are seen to be risk averse (as a minor technological error could have significant financial consequences for a client).&lt;ref name="LawTechToday"/&gt;

However, the growth of the hiring by businesses of in-house counsel and their increasing sophistication, together with the development of email, has led to clients placing increasing cost and time pressure on their lawyers.&lt;ref name="LawTechToday"/&gt;  In addition, there are increasing incentives for lawyers to become technologically competent, with the [[American Bar Association]] voting in August 2012 to amend the [[American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct|Model Rules of Professional Conduct]] to require lawyers to keep abreast of "the benefits and risks associated with relevant technology",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Client-Lawyer Relationship, Rule 1.1 Competence - Comment|url=http://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_1_1_competence/comment_on_rule_1_1.html|publisher=American Bar Association|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ambrogi|first1=Robert|title=The Cloud Has Landed: 10 Legal Tech Innovations and What They Mean|url=http://www.wisbar.org/NewsPublications/WisconsinLawyer/Pages/Article.aspx?Volume=88&amp;Issue=4&amp;ArticleID=23997|website=Wisconsin Lawyer|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the saturation of the market leading many lawyers to look for cutting-edge ways to compete.  &lt;ref name="TechCrunch1"/&gt; The exponential growth in the volume of documents (mostly email) that must be reviewed for litigation cases has greatly accelerated the adoption of technology used in eDiscovery, with elements of machine language and artificial intelligence being incorporated and cloud-based services being adopted by law firms.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Investment in Legal Tech is predominantly focused in the United States with more than $254 million invested in 2014 in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legaltransformationinstitute.com/blog/2014/3/10/legal-startup-funding-2014-so-far |title=Legal Startup Funding &amp;#124; 2014 So Far [Update 10/24/14&amp;#93; — LTI |website=Legaltransformationinstitute.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; however there is significant growth worldwide.&lt;ref name="Forbes2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rubin|first1=Basha|title=Is The Legal Tech Boom Over?

[[Stanford Law School]] has started CodeX, the Center for Legal Informatics, an interdisciplinary research center, which also incubates companies started by law students and computer scientists. Some companies that have come out of the program include [[Lex Machina]] and [[Legal.io]].&lt;ref name="lawinsider"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stanford Law School |url=https://www.law.stanford.edu/organizations/programs-and-centers/codex-the-stanford-center-for-legal-informatics |title=CodeX - Programs and Centers - Stanford Law School |website=Law.stanford.edu |date=2016-11-27 |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key areas==
Traditional areas of Legal Tech include:
* [[legal matter management|Practice management]]
* [[document management system|Document storage]]
* [[invoicing|Billing]]
* [[Accounting]]
* [[Electronic discovery]]
* [[Legal research]]
* [[document automation|Document Automation/Assembly]] 

More recent areas of growth in Legal Tech focus on:
* Providing tools or a marketplace to connect clients with lawyers
* Providing tools for consumers and businesses to complete legal matters by themselves, obviating the need for a lawyer
* Data and contract analytics
* Automation of legal writing or aspects other substantive aspects of legal practice
* Platforms for succession planning i.e Will writing, via online applications
* Providing tools to assist with immigration document preparation in lieu of hiring a lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hobbs |first=Stephen |url=http://gazette.com/simplifying-idea/article/1565568 |title=Simplifying idea &amp;#124; Colorado Springs Gazette, News |website=Gazette.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-37565064.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170125152948/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-37565064.html |archivedate=2017-01-25 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="110908">An '''enacting clause''', or '''enacting formula''', is a short phrase that introduces the main provisions of a [[law]] [[Coming into force|enacted]] by a [[legislature]]. It usually declares the source from which the law claims to derive its authority. In many countries, an enacting formula is not considered necessary and is simply omitted.

The simplest enacting clauses merely cite the legislature by which the law has been adopted; for example the enacting clause used in [[Australia]] since 1990 is "The Parliament of Australia enacts".&lt;ref name="aust"/&gt; Alternatively an enacting clause may invoke the ultimate sovereign. For example, California, based on the principle of [[popular sovereignty]], has the following enacting clause: "The People of the State of California do enact as follows."{{ref|US-CA}}

In Belgium the enacting formula appears in the official journal (Belgisch Staatsbald/Moniteur belgue) when the law is promulgated and published, but is usually thereafter not included when the law is printed in compilations, or stored in internet databases, even official ones. The enacting clause is as follows.

{{quote|N. (e.g. PHILIPPE), King of the Belgians: To all, present and to come, greeting. The Chambers have adopted and We sanction the following: (the articles of the law then follow.

{{quote|"THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC: I make it known that the National Congress decrees and I sanction the following Law:"}}
{{quote|{{lang-pt|"O PRESIDENTE DA REPÚBLICA: Faço saber que o Congresso Nacional decreta e eu sanciono a seguinte Lei:"'}}}}

In Brazil the presidential assent to a bill is called "sanction". After passing both Houses of Congress (the Chamber of Deputies and the Federal Senate), the final version of the bill, duly signed by the presiding officers of both Houses, is sent to the President of the Republic. The document is still called a "proposed law", with a bill number, and with the header "''The National Congress decrees:''" (In Portuguese: ''"O Congresso Nacional decreta:"''). If the President approves the bill, a different copy of the act is prepared by the Presidency of the Republic, with the official number of the Law and the date of enactment of the law, and also with the replacement of the clause "The National Congress decrees:" with the above mentioned formula "''THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC: I make it known that the National Congress decrees and I sanction the following Law:''". The signatures of the presiding officers of Congress are therefore not present in this version of the act. This is the version of the statute that is published in the Official Journal and that is included in the statute books. When granting his approval to a bill, the President signs both the bill sent to him by Congress and the final version of the statute with the presidential enacting formula. The signed Bill is returned to Congress by means of a presidential message; the signed statute with the presidential enacting formula is printed in the Official Journal, and the original is thereafter sent to the National Archive.
Thus, in Brazil, the President is always seen signing two different documents at bill signing ceremony (the two documents are called the "autographs"): one is the text of the proposed law, the other is the final text of the statute. Technically, the first signature (on the Bill) is the "sanction to the proposed law", that is, the approval of the bill, that transforms it in a Law, and the second signature (on the statute with the presidential enacting formula) is the promulgation, the announcement to the people that the Law has been adopted. While the signature of the President on the bill includes the addition of the formula "I sanction it" (in Portuguese: "Sanciono") above the signature, this is not seen in the final "promulgation" version of the statute. On the other hand, the promulgated statute contains not only the signature of the president, but also the countersignatures of his ministers principally charged with applying the law.

When the president vetoes a bill, and the veto is overridden, the Bill is returned by Congress to the President not for sanction (approval), but merely for promulgation. In that case, the president is expected to promulgate the bill in 48 hours. In that situation, the enacting formula that appears in the final text of the adopted statute is as follows:

{{quote|"THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC: I make it known that the National Congress maintained and I promulgate the following Law:"}}
{{quote|{{lang-pt|"O PRESIDENTE DA REPÚBLICA: Faço saber que o Congresso Nacional manteve e eu promulgo a seguinte Lei:"}}}}

Tacit sanction (i.e. implicit approval) is deemed to take place if the president fails to sign or veto a bill within the constitutionally mandated timeframe of fifteen working days from receiving the bill. Once the bill is considered implicitlly sanctioned, the president is expected to promulgate the new law and the same 48-hour timeframe applies. The formula in this case is:

{{quote|"THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC: I make it known that the National Congress decrees and I promulgate the following Law:"}}
{{quote|{{lang-pt|"O PRESIDENTE DA REPÚBLICA: Faço saber que o Congresso Nacional decreta e eu promulgo a seguinte Lei:"}}}}

Should the president refuse to promulgate, or fail to promulgate in the period of 48 hours, a bill, after his veto has been overridden by Congress, then the authority to promulgate the bill passes to the President of the Senate. In that case, the formula of promulgation is:

{{quote|"The President of the FEDERAL SENATE promulgates, in accordance with art. 66 §7, of the Federal Constitution, the following Law, that results from bill vetoed by the President of the Republic and maintained by the National Congress:"}}
{{quote|{{lang-pt|"O Presidente do SENADO FEDERAL promulga, nos termos do art. 66, § 7, da Constituição Federal, a seguinte Lei, resultante de Projeto vetado pelo Presidente da República e mantido pelo Congresso Nacional:"}}}}

Should the president of the Republic refuse to promulgate, or fail to promulgate in the period of 48 hours, a bill, after the bill has been implicitly sanctioned due to his failure to sign or veto it within the constitutionally mandated timeframe, then the authority to promulgate the bill passes to the President of the Senate. In that case, the formula of promulgation is:

{{quote|"I make it known that the NATIONAL CONGRESS enacted, the President of the Republic, in accordance with the provisions of §3 of the art. 66 of the Constitution, sanctioned, and I, (NAME IN CAPITAL LETTERS), President of the Federal Senate, in accordance with the §7 of the same article, do promulgate the following Law:"}}
{{quote|{{lang-pt|"Faço saber que o CONGRESSO NACIONAL aprovou, o Presidente da República, nos termos do § 3o do art. 66 da Constituição, sancionou, e eu, (NAME IN CAPITAL LETTERS), Presidente do Senado Federal, nos termos do § 7o do mesmo artigo promulgo a seguinte Lei:"}}}}

Whenever the president adopts a provisional measure and the provisional measure is approved by Congress with changes, a normal bill is sent to the president for approval or veto, and the same formulas used for other bills are employed; once enacted, the new statute replaces the provisional measure. However, if the provisional measure adopted by the president is approved by Congress without changes, the bill does not need to be presented for approval or veto; in that case, the law that both corresponds fully to the provisional measure and replaces it is promulgated directly by the President of the Senate, with the following words:

{{quote|"I make it known that the President of the Republic adopted the Provisional Measure number NNN of YYYY, that the National Congress approved, and I, (NAME IN CAPITAL LETTERS), President of the Federal Senate, for the effects of the provision of the sole paragraph of art. 62 of the Federal Constitution, do promulgate the following Law:"}}
{{quote|{{lang-pt|"Faço saber que o Presidente da República adotou a Medida Provisória no NN, de YYYY, que o Congresso Nacional aprovou e eu, (NAME IN CAPITAL LETTERS), Presidente do Senado Federal, para os efeitos do disposto no parágrafo único do art. 62 da Constituição Federal, promulgo a seguinte Lei:"}}}}

'''General Assembly of the Empire of Brazil''' (1822-1889)

Whenever the General Assembly of the Empire (made up of a Senate and of a Chamber of Deputies) passed a bill, a decree of the General Assembly containing the articles of the approved bill was sent to the Emperor for sanction or veto. The Decree of the General Assembly began with the following formula (that did not appear in the final version of the statute, after the imperial sanction): "''The General Assembly decrees:''" (in Portuguese: "''A Assembleia Geral decreta:''"). The decree was still only a proposed law, that would become an actual law if sanctioned by the Emperor. The General Assembly sent its decree to the Emperor for sanction or veto by means of a message with the words following: "''The General Assembly sends to the Emperor the enclosed decree, that it considers advantageous, and useful to the Empire, and it asks that His Imperial Majesty may be pleased to grant it His sanction''" (in Portuguese: "''A Assembleia Geral dirige ao Imperador o decreto incluso, que julga vantajoso e útil ao Império, e pede a Sua Majestade Imperial, se digne dar a Sua sanção"''). If the Emperor decided to sanction the decree, then he sent the message of the General Assembly back to the Legislature, adding after the text of the Decree of the General Assembly the following words, together with the date and his signature: ""''The Emperor consents''" (in Portuguese: "''O Imperador consente''"). Then, the Executive branch prepared a formal document to promulgate the new law, and this document was known in the imperial period as a ''Charter of Law'' (in Portuguese: ''Carta de Lei''). It was the chartered version of the law that was included in the statute books and that was printed and published for the knowledge of the people. Thus, the Charter of Law was the final version of the statute as adopted. It was signed by the Emperor and countersigned by his responsible Ministers, and contained an enacting formula as follows:

{{quote|NAME OF THE EMPEROR PRECEDED BY THE TITLE "DOM" (e.g. "DOM PETER THE SECOND"), by the grace of God and unanimous acclamation of the peoples, Constitutional Emperor and Perpetual Defender of Brazil: We make it known to all Our subjects that the General Assembly has decreed and We will the following law:

The Secretary of State of the Affairs of... (title of the responsible Minister of the Crown who countersigns the Act with the Emperor and who heads the Department principally charged with applying the Law) is to make this Law be printed, published and circulated. Given at the Palace of... on (day) of (month) of (year), in the (year) of the Independence and of the Empire.}}

{{quote|{{lang-pt|NAME OF THE EMPEROR PRECEDED BY THE TITLE "DOM" (e.g. "DOM PEDRO SEGUNDO"), por graça de Deus e unânime aclamação dos povos, Imperador Constitucional e Defensor Perpétuo do Brasil: Fazemos saber a todos os Nossos súditos que a Assembleia Geral decretou e Nós queremos a seguinte lei:

When the powers of the Emperor were discharged by Regents on behalf of the monarch the formula was as follows:

{{quote|The Regency (or "The Regent"; or "The Princess Imperial Regent"), in the Name of His Majesty the Emperor, the Lord (name of the Emperor preceded by the title "Dom", e.g., "Dom Pedro II"), makes it known to all the subjects of the Empire that the General Assembly has decreed and it (or "He" or "She") sanctioned the following law:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8457">In [[software design]], '''''look and feel''''' is a term used in respect of a [[graphical user interface]] and comprises aspects of its design, including elements such as colors, shapes, layout, and [[typeface]]s (the "look"), as well as the behavior of dynamic elements such as buttons, boxes, and menus (the "feel"). The term can also refer to aspects of a non-graphical [[user interface]] (such as a [[command-line interface]]), as well as to aspects of an [[API]] – mostly to parts of an API that are not related to its functional properties. The term is used in reference to both [[software]] and [[website]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://www.bopdesign.com/bop-blog/2013/11/what-is-the-look-and-feel-of-a-website-and-why-its-important
|title=What is the “Look and Feel” of a Website?  
|date=November 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title=Look and Feel in Computer Software  |website=ComputerLaw.com
|url=https://www.computerlaw.com/Articles/Look-and-Feel-in-Computer-Software.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Look and feel applies to other products. In documentation, for example, it refers to the graphical layout (document size, color, font, etc.) and the writing style. In the context of equipment, it refers to consistency in controls and displays across a product line.

Look and feel in [[operating system]] [[user interface]]s serves two general purposes. First, it provides [[brand]]ing, helping to identify a set of products from one company. Second, it increases ease of use, since users will become familiar with how one product functions (looks, reads, etc.) and can translate their experience to other products with the same look and feel.

==In widget toolkits==
Contrary to [[operating system]] [[user interface]]s, for which look and feel is a part of the product identification, [[widget toolkit]]s often allow users to specialize their [[Application software|application]] look and feel, by deriving the default look and feel of the toolkit, or by completely defining their own. This specialization can go from [[Skin (computing)|skinning]] (that only deals with the look, or visual appearance of the [[Graphical control element (software)|graphical control element]]s to completely specializing the way the user [[Interactivity|interacts with]] the software (that is, the feel).

The definition of the look and feel to associate with the [[Application software|application]] is often done at initialization, but some Widget toolkits, such as the [[Swing (Java)|Swing]] widget toolkit that is part of the [[Java (programming language)|Java]] [[API]], allow users to change the look and feel at runtime (see [[Pluggable look and feel]]).

Some examples of Widget toolkits that support setting a specialized look and feel are:
* [[XUL]] (XML User Interface Language): The look and feel of the user interface can be specialized in a [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] file associated with the XUL definition files. Properties that can be specialized from the default are, for example, background or foreground colors of widgets, fonts, size of widgets, and so on.
* Swing supports specializing the look and feel of widgets by deriving from the default, another existing one, creating one from scratch, or, beginning with J2SE 5.0, in an [[XML]] property file called [[Synth Look and Feel|synth]] (skinnable look and feel).

==Lawsuits==
Some companies try to assert [[copyright]] of [[trade dress]] over their look and feel.

The ''[[Broderbund v. Unison]]'' (1986) case was an early [[software copyright]] case that attempted to apply U.S. copyright law to the look and feel presented by a software product.

In 1987 Lotus sued [[Paperback Software International|Paperback Software]] and Mosaic for copyright infringement, false and misleading advertising, and [[unfair competition]] over their low-cost clones of 1-2-3, VP Planner and Twin, and sued [[Borland]] over its Quattro spreadsheet.&lt;ref name=NewsW/&gt;

In December, 1989&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper |newspaper=The New York Times
|author=Lawrence Fisher  |date=December 15, 1989
|title=Xerox Sues Apple Computer Over Macintosh Copyright
|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/15/business/company-news-xerox-sues-apple-computer-over-macintosh-copyright.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Xerox
sued Apple over the Macintosh copyright. 

[[Apple Computer]] was notable for its use of the term ''look and feel'' in reference to their [[classic Mac OS|Mac OS]] [[operating system]]. The firm tried, with some success, to block other software developers from creating software that had a similar look and feel.  Apple argued that they had a [[copyright]] claim on the look and feel of their software, and even went so far as to sue [[Microsoft]], alleging that the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] [[operating system]] was illegally copying their look and feel.&lt;ref name=ForbGood&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/timothylee/2011/10/25/yes-google-stole-from-apple-and-thats-a-good-thing/|title=Yes, Google "Stole" From Apple, And That's A Good Thing|publisher=Forbes|author=Timothy B. Lee|date=2011-10-25|accessdate=2015-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although provoking a vehement reaction from some in the [[software]] community,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/bulletins/bull5.html#SEC9|title=Special Report: Apple's New Look and Feel}}&lt;/ref&gt; and causing [[Richard Stallman]] to form the [[League for Programming Freedom]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/digital-inclusion-in-freedom.en.html#content|title=Is Digital Inclusion a Good Thing? How Can We Make Sure It Is?|publisher=gnu.org|author=Richard Stallman|accessdate=2015-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; the expected landmark ruling never happened, as most of the issues were resolved based on a license that Apple had granted Microsoft for Windows 1.0. ''See:'' ''[[Apple v. Microsoft]]''. The First Circuit Court of Appeals rejected a copyright claim on the feel of a user interface in ''[[Lotus v. Borland]]''.

===Taking it to the street===
GNU's Richard M. Stallman led an "Innovate, don't litigate" public demonstration outside [[Lotus Software|Lotus]]'s headquarters&lt;ref name=NewsW&gt;{{cite magazine
|magazine=Newsweek |date=August 27, 1990  |author1=John Scwartz
|author2=Debra Rosenberg |title=Computing the Cost of Copyright: Programmers fight "Look and Feel" lawsuits}}&lt;/ref&gt;, using a [[hexadecimal]] chant:
:: ''1-2-3-4'' kick the lawsuits out the door
:: ''5-6-7-8'' innovate, don't litigate
:: ''9-A-B-C'' interfaces should be free
:: ''D,E,F,0''&lt;ref&gt;(Oh)&lt;/ref&gt; look and feel has got to go!

===More recent reactions===
More recently, [[Apple Inc.]] has filed lawsuits against competing manufacturers of [[smartphones]] and [[tablet computers]], claiming that those manufacturers copied the look and feel of Apple's popular [[iPhone]] and [[iPad]] products.&lt;ref name=ForbGood/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/derekbroes/2011/09/24/samsung-vs-apple-and-the-winner-is/|title=Samsung vs. Apple: And The Winner Is...|publisher=Forbes|author=Derek Broes|date=2011-09-24|accessdate=2015-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/3/31/5564134/round-two-apple-and-samsung-suit-up-for-another-billon-dollar-patent|title=Round two: Apple and Samsung suit up for another billion dollar patent war|publisher=The Verge|author=Josh Lowensohn|date=March 31, 2014|accessdate=2015-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In APIs==
An [[API]], which is an interface to software which provides some sort of functionality, can also have a certain look and feel.  Different parts of an API (e.g. different classes or packages) are often linked by common syntactic and semantic conventions (e.g. by the same asynchronous execution model, or by the same way object attributes are accessed).  These elements are rendered either explicitly (i.e. are part of the [[syntax]] of the API), or implicitly (i.e. are part of the [[semantics]] of the API).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4655">[[File:Scene at the Signing of the Constitution of the United States.jpg|210px|thumb|Delegates of the [[Philadelphia Convention]]. Before this meeting, only a de facto metaconstitution existed.]]
A '''metaconstitution''' is a set of pre-constitutional rules.&lt;ref&gt;These rules are often referred to as "metarules". The metarules are developed from axioms appropriate to the time period. Thus, what is actually constructed can be variable.&lt;/ref&gt; It is in lieu of a formalized [[constitution]] and consists of accepted axiomatic policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Alexander |first= Larry|title=  Constitutionalism:Philosophical Foundations| pages= 2–3| isbn=0-521-79999-6| publisher= Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The constitution is similar to or developed from this. A metaconstitution is also less binding, and can be used to a less rigid form of government. To many nations, the metaconstitution provides an "exit-option", where they may variate from the written document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aaken |first= Anne Van|author2=Christian List |author3=Christoph Lutege |title=Deliberation and Decision|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.| isbn=0-7546-2358-0| page=xvii}}&lt;/ref&gt; A metaconstitution, unlike formal constitutions, never needs to be written. Its creation results from the morality and judgment of the people. To be formulated, the people must be generally opposed to anarchy and must desire some form of governing force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=O'Mahony|first=Paul|title= Criminal Justice in Ireland| publisher=Institute of Public Administration| isbn=1-902448-71-5| page= 76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although vague in concept, the metaconstitution almost always creates the basic roles of leader v. follower. The purpose of the document, however, prevents the placement of total power on the leader. The populace is trusted to self-govern except in severe cases. Such theory does not differ much from [[salutary neglect]] or [[laissez faire]].

==Historical concept==
Many prominent political philosophers have discoursed on the subject of metaconstitutionalism, though not directly. Some address the topic as a looser constitution in which the government's singular duty is to protect the people and vice versa. Per [[Alexis de Tocqueville]]: {{cquote|If it be admitted that a man possessing absolute power may misuse that power . . . . why should not a majority be liable to the same reproach? Men do not change their characters by uniting with each other. . . . For myself, when I feel the hand of power lie heavy on my brow, I care but little to know who oppresses me; and I am not the more disposed to pass beneath the yoke because it is held out to me by the arms of a million of men.|25px|25px|Alexis de Tocqueville (1805-1859), Democracy in America, New York: New American Library, 1956, pp. 114, 149}}

The concept of metaconstitutionalism received light during the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]], as a possible replacement to the [[Articles of Confederation]]. Per the Federalist, Number 51: {{cquote|In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself . A dependence on the people is, no doubt, the primary control on government; but experience has taught mankind the necessity of auxiliary precautions.|25px|25px|Federalist, Number 51}}

==Metaconstitutions==

{{Empty section|date=March 2013}}

==Criticisms==
A metaconstitution is constructed to provide a looser equivalent for government. However, a metaconstitutionalistic society is more likely to suffer from domestic disorder.&lt;ref name= "disorder"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kromkowski|first=Charles Aloysius|title=Recreating the American Republic|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-80848-0|page=xxviii}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because the government cannot wield any power to control the outbreak. Lack of trade and corruption are also major difficulties for a metaconstitution. Again, the governments legal inability to enforce powerful law prevents it from containing situations.&lt;ref name= "disorder" /&gt; In this usage of "metaconstitution", it can also mean a constitution with a nearly non-existent [[executive branch]].

[[File:Witness impeachment.jpg|thumb|Mock trials allow researchers to examine [[confirmation bias]]es in a realistic setting]]

A '''mock trial''' is an act or imitation [[trial (law)|trial]]. It is similar to a [[moot court]], but mock trials simulate lower-court trials, while moot court simulates [[appellate court]] hearings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.learningthelaw.in/2016/07/court-moot-court-mock-court-and-mock.html Court, Moot Court, Mock Court and Mock Trial], Available at Learning the Law.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lawyer|Attorneys]] preparing for a real trial might use a mock trial consisting of volunteers as role players to test theories or experiment with each other.  Mock trial is also the name of an [[extracurricular]] program in which [[student]]s participate in rehearsed trials to learn about the legal system in a competitive manner. Interscholastic mock trials take place on all levels including [[primary school]], [[middle school]], [[high school]], [[college]], and [[law school]].  Mock trial is often taught in conjunction with a course in [[trial advocacy]] or takes place as an after school enrichment activity. Some gifted and talented programs may also take place in one.

==Litigation related mock trials==
Litigators may use mock trials to assist with trial preparation and settlement negotiations of actual cases. Unlike school-related mock trials, these mock trials can take numerous forms depending on the information sought.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelawinsider.com/mock-trial-lawschool/what-is-a-mock-trial/ scholastic mock trials]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when faced with complex fact issues in a particular case, attorneys might convene a mini mock trial to try different methods of presenting their evidence, sometimes before a jury.

==Competitive school-related mock trials around the world==

===Asia Pacific===
[[Guam]] has been hosting the annual Asia-Pacific Invitational Mock Trial Competition. In 2011 and 2012, there were 14 teams from Guam, [[South Korea]], and [[Saipan]] in its 4th annual competition. The competition was held at [[Government of Guam#The Superior Court of Guam|the Superior Court of Guam]]. The teams made up of mostly junior and senior students from [[high school]]s. The Champion of the 4th Annual Asia-Pacific Invitational Mock Trial Competition was Marianas Baptist Academy of Saipan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MBA is Asia-Pacific invitational mock trial competition champion |url=http://www.saipantribune.com/newsstory.aspx?newsID=123309 |accessdate=29 December 2012 |newspaper=Saipan Tribune |date=12 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526073517/http://www.saipantribune.com/newsstory.aspx?newsID=123309 |archivedate=26 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Established in 2005, the [[Surana and Surana Moots|Surana &amp; Surana National Trial Advocacy Moot]] was conceived as one of its kind  with the aim of promoting skills of trial advocacy. In its 10th successful year (2014), this national moot trial is one of the most appreciated for its innovation and structure. Popular demand led to the creation of three more editions of this unique trial competition [India North, India South, India North East &amp; India West (from 2014–15) rounds.] This competition  has the distinction of being the first ever to be held in the North Eastern region of India in 2012. The structure is such that  law students from the host institution participate by enacting the role of  witnesses for the oral rounds. The students and faculty welcome this, as it provides a unique opportunity to learn practical aspects of a trial, first hand.

===Australia===
Mock trial competitions in Australia are held regionally. These include:
* The Law Society of South Australia Mock Trial Competition comprises a series of simulated court cases by students [[Education in Australia|years 10, 11 and 12]] from 32 schools in [[South Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mock Trial Competition|url=http://www.lawsocietysa.asn.au/other/mock_trial.asp|publisher=The Law Society of South Australia|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Law Society of Western Australia Interschool Mock Trial Competition is held each year for students enrolled in years 10, 11 and 12 in [[Western Australia]]. There were 773 students representing 68 teams from 38 schools participated in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mock Trials Competition |url=http://www.lawsocietywa.asn.au/mock-trials.html |publisher=The Law Society of Western Australia |accessdate=29 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101085042/http://www.lawsocietywa.asn.au/mock-trials.html |archivedate=1 November 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Capital Region Mock Trial Competition is organized by [[University of Canberra]]. There were teams of schools in [[Australian Capital Territory]] region with year 10, 11 and 12 students.
* The New South Wales Mock Trial Competition has been running since 1981 for students years 10 and 11 in [[New South Wales]] initially with 28 schools. There have also been international events with mock trial competitions between Australia and the United Kingdom. In 2008, schools from this region also traveled to [[New York City]] to compete in the Empire Mock Trial Competition. The first Asia-Australia mock trial competition via video conference between Australian teams and a Korean team was held in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mock Trial Competition|url=http://www.lawsociety.com.au/community/forschools/mocktrial/Mocktrial|publisher=The Law Society of New South Wales|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thomson|first=Jodie|title=First Asia-Australia mock trial|journal=The National Legal Eagle|date=10 January 2009|volume=15|issue=2|page=18|url=http://epublications.bond.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1139&amp;context=nle|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continental Europe===
Mock trials in continental Europe are less coordinated than their UK or US counterparts, but there are a few isolated examples. In Germany, the Faculty of Legal Sciences of the [[University of Regensburg]] organizes the REGINA Mock Trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=REGINA Mock Trial: Der Gerichtssimulator|url=http://www.uni-regensburg.de/rechtswissenschaft/fakultaet/medien/regina/mock_trial_flyer_hp.pdf|website=University of Regensburg|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg]] organizes a mock trial specialized in administrative law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mock Trial im Verwaltungsprozessrecht|url=https://www.jura.rw.fau.de/mock-trial-im-verwaltungsprozessrecht-2/|website=Fachbereich Rechtswissenschaft|publisher=Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Spain, there is a mock trial program specialized in [[insurance law]] coordinated by the [[Fernando Peña López|Fundacion INADE-UDC Chair of Risk Management and Insurance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Veredicto Ejemplar|url=https://catedrafundacioninade.org/veredicto-ejemplar/2018|website=Cátedra Fundación INADE-UDC|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{Main|Bar Mock Trial}}
The Bar National Mock Trial Competition involves students to take on the roles of [[barrister]]s and [[witness]]es and present their case against teams from other schools. It has been running annually since 1991 with regional tournaments and the national final. There are 2,000 students in years 10 to 13, 300 barristers and advocates, and 90 judges involved in this competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bar National Mock Trial Competition|url=http://www.citizenshipfoundation.org.uk/main/comps.php?175|publisher=Citizenship Foundation|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The School Mock Court Case Project runs both primary and secondary school competitions primarily in Scotland, although has undertaken a number of international competitions. Currently some 100 schools, circa 3,000 students are involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=School Mock Court Project- Background|url=https://www.mockcourt.org.uk/background.php|publisher=School Mock Court Case Project SCIO|accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=schools-mock-court-project-seeks-legal-tutors|url=https://www.scottishlegal.com/article/schools-mock-court-project-seeks-legal-tutors|publisher=Scottish Legal News|accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=dundee-people-dundee-high-school-pupils-win-national-mock-trial-competition|url=https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/fp/dundee-people-dundee-high-school-pupils-win-national-mock-trial-competition/|publisher=DC Thomson Co Ltd|accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
====Competition framework====
Competitive mock trial functions in yearly cycles.  Each year, a case packet is distributed to all participating schools in late summer to early fall.  The case packet is a series of documents including the charges, penal code, stipulations, case law, and jury instructions as well as all [[Exhibit (legal)|exhibits]] and [[affidavit]]s relevant to the case.  During a mock trial, competitors are restricted to only the materials provided in the case packet and may not reference any outside sources.  In order to prepare for competition, teams thoroughly read and analyze the case packet.

National mock trial teams consist of a minimum of six and a maximum of twelve official members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegemocktrial.org/AMTA%20Rulebook%202012%20HL.pdf |title=American Mock Trial Association Rulebook, Page 16 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-06-14 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The size of state mock trial teams can vary; California, for example, allows up to 25 official team members.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crf-usa.org/images/stories/mt_la/2014-15_mock_trial_team_rulebook.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Each team prepares both sides of the case:  prosecution and defense in a criminal trial, plaintiff and defense in a civil action.  Each side is composed of two or three attorneys as well as two or three witnesses, all played by members of the team. Teams must be organized into two sides of five to six players for the prosecution/plaintiff and defense.&lt;ref name = "rules"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalmocktrial.org/fullrules.cfm |title=National High School Mock Trial Championship |publisher=Nationalmocktrial.org |date=2010-02-08 |accessdate=2012-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nysba.org/Content/NavigationMenu/Public_Resources/Law,_Youth_and_Citizenship/Mock_Trial_Tournament/Mock_Trial_Tournament.htm NYSBA Mock Trial] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that high school mock trial is governed by state bar associations, meaning that cases, rules, and competition structure vary from state to state whereas all of college mock trial is governed by the American Mock Trial Association, meaning that every school uses the same case and is subject to the same rules.

====Procedure====
[[Image:Mock trial closing.jpg|thumb|A [[student]] giving his closing argument during a mock trial]]

The mock trial begins with the judge entering the courtroom. The judge then gives out the instructions to the jury (about what they are to listen to). Then if there is a pretrial motion, the defense and prosecution give their respective pretrial arguments. The judge then lets the prosecution or plaintiff give an opening statement. Following the prosecution/plaintiff's opening statement, the judge may offer the defense to deliver the opening statement during that time as well, or to wait until after the prosecution has presented all of its witnesses. After the opening statements, examination of the witnesses begins. The prosecution/plaintiff calls their witnesses first. Witnesses are sworn in by their team's bailiff/timekeeper. A student competitor attorney for the prosecution/plaintiff does a direct examination of the witness. Once the direct examination is complete, the opposing team may cross-examine the witness. After the cross-examination, if the first team chooses, they may redirect the witness and, likewise, the other team may do a re-cross after this. However, redirect and re-cross examinations are only limited to the scope of the previous examination conducted by opposing counsel. This process is repeated for the two remaining plaintiff witnesses. Once the prosecution/plaintiff have finished with their witnesses, the defense may give their opening statement if not delivered before, and then the process is repeated with the defense witnesses, having the defense attorneys direct and the plaintiff attorneys cross-examine.&lt;ref name = "rules"/&gt;

Once all of the witnesses have been examined, the trial moves to closing arguments. The prosecutor/plaintiff again goes first and has the option to reserve time before hand for rebuttal. After the defense finishes their closing argument, the plaintiff may give their rebuttal argument if they still have time remaining. In some competitions, the rebuttal is limited to the scope of the defense’s closing argument.&lt;ref name = "rules"/&gt; Time limits are set at each level of competition to prevent the trials from running too long and to keep rounds of competition running smoothly. Time limits are as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|+Time Limits of Mock Trial Competition
!Statement/Examination/Argument
!Time Limit
|-
|Opening Statement
|5 minutes
|-
|Direct and Redirect Examination
|25 minutes
|-
|Cross and Recross Examination
|25 minutes
|-
|Pre-Closing Preparation
|2 minutes
|-
|Closing Argument
|9 minutes
|-
|Rebuttal (Prosecution only)
|Amount of time reserved before closing
|}
Time limits may vary from state-to-state competitions. Please note that time is kept track of by the bailiff/timekeeper, who times their co-counsel's statements, examinations, and arguments. Time is stopped for objections.

==== Objections ====
A main part of Mock Trial is the raising and arguing of objections given by opposing teams. Objections are raised when the opposing counsel attempts to bring in evidence or testimony that go against the rules of evidence. When an objection is raised, the judge may either overrule or sustain it immediately, or ask opposing counsel for their argument about why the testimony/evidence is admissible. Time is paused for objections, so an objection "battle" could go on for hours at a time until the judge makes a ruling. Mock Trial students receive an abridged version of [[Rules of evidence|Rules of Evidence]] to base their objections on in the case packet that contains the witness affidavits and other elements of the court case.

====Judging====
[[Image:Mock trial critique.jpg|thumb|left|Attorney evaluators give a critique at the end of a mock trial competition.]]

There are several different ways that a mock trial can be judged. In one, the judges for scoring the mock trial consist of the presiding judge and two scoring judges, all of whom score the teams. In a second method, there are two scoring judges and the presiding judge, as in the first method, but the presiding judge does not score the teams, rather the judge simply votes or casts a ballot for one team or another.&lt;ref name = "rules"/&gt; In yet another method of judging, there are three scoring judges and the presiding judge is not involved in the scoring of the teams. Often at college invitationals, there are two scoring judges, one of whom doubles as the presiding judge. Since enticing attorneys to judge is notoriously difficult (as judges are rarely compensated with more than a free lunch), it is rare to see more than two judges in a round at most competitions.

Unlike real law, the victorious team does not necessarily have to win on the merits of the case. Instead, evaluators score individual attorneys and witnesses on a 1-10 scale (though some states use different scales for high school competitions) based on each stage of the trial. These consist of the opening statements for the plaintiff and defense, each of the witnesses’ testimony, direct and cross-examination by attorneys, and the closing statements for both sides. The team with the highest total number of points is often, but not always, the team that wins the judge's verdict. Given this method of scoring, it is possible for the defendant to be found guilty or lose the case but for the defense team to still win the round.

In some competitions, points can be deducted from a team’s score for testifying with information outside the scope of the mock trial materials and for unsportsmanlike conduct or abuse of objections. However, scores are completely at a judge's discretion, meaning that scores are subjective based on different evaluation criteria.

====Power matching====
In the first round of the tournament, all of the teams are randomly matched to compete with each other. After the first round of some tournaments, teams are “power matched” to go up against other teams with similar records (e.g. in the second round, a 1-0 team will be matched with another 1-0 team).&lt;ref name = "rules"/&gt; If there is a tie in record, the judges will use the number of ballots and total points earned to decide the matching.&lt;ref name = "rules"/&gt; This allows for teams to compete with other teams of similar skill.

=====National championship format=====
In the national championship format, which is also employed by invitationals across the country, the tournament is power matched through the last round. While this determines the strongest team at the tournament overall, it does not provide an accurate representation of 2nd, 3rd, 4th place teams, etc., because they might have lost multiple ballots to a strong team who placed first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegemocktrial.org/mock/tabulation.php |title=The American Mock Trial Association |publisher=Collegemocktrial.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of course, there are practical exceptions to the theory of power matching. Tab room coordinators who are creating brackets for each round may deviate from the rules of power matching in order to 1. allow each team to alternate between prosecution/plaintiff and defense between rounds, 2. avoid two teams from the same school competing against each other (Maryland Rule), 3. avoid having a team compete against a team it played in a prior round.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tba.org/mocktrial/2010_stateforms/powermatching.pdf ]{{dead link|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Power protection=====
When tournaments are power protected, it means that the first rounds of competition are power matched as stated above. In the last round(s), however, the team with the strongest record is paired against the team with the weakest record. This ensures that the best teams do not knock each other out of the running for a rank. Rather, it's anticipated that the stronger team will win and protect their chance at a rank, while there is no harm done to the weaker team who is already out of reach of a trophy. Additionally, this method gives weaker teams exposure to stronger programs that they can learn from.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.collegemocktrial.org/mock/tabulation_files/0809tabmanualfebruaryupdate_2-3-09.doc |title=American Mock Trial Association |publisher=Webcache.googleusercontent.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-21 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Levels of competition====

=====Elementary school=====
At the elementary school level, the mock trial guide by [[American Bar Association]] suggests to use role-playing from scripted mock trials such as [[fairy tale]] mock trials as a way to introduce the concept of conflicts, trials, jury verdicts in civil trials, vocabulary of the court, damages, and the roles of individuals portrayed in the trial. Therefore, most of mock trials at this level are non-competitive classroom activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Putting on mock trials.|year=2002|publisher=Division for Public Education, American Bar Association|location=Chicago, IL|isbn=1-59031-154-X|url=http://lre.ncbar.org/media/27617684/mocktrialguide.pdf|edition=[Rev. ed.].}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no national competition for this level. However, a few states offer intrastate competitions. There are a couple difference formats of competitions for this level.

The first format focuses on how the cases are developed such as ''New Jersey Law Fair'' competitions. Students grades 3 to 6 are asked to generate, develop and write the case from their own idea to include details of the facts, issue, witnesses, statements, instructions, sub-issues, concepts and law. As the students at this age range may not know the details of applicable law, students are allowed to create their own law. There are no specific themes, students can choose any age-appropriate topics. The students are encouraged to do a role-playing in a mock trial based on the script that they have developed to involve other students in the classroom as juries in order to refine their case. Each team plays the roles of both side in their case during the mock trial. The winners will perform their case in the real court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Law Fair for 3rd through 6thgraders|url=http://www.njsbf.org/images/content/1/1/11471/Law%20Fair%202013%20Rules%20Booklet.pdf|publisher=The New Jersey State Bar Foundation|accessdate=29 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204030526/http://www.njsbf.org/images/content/1/1/11471/Law%20Fair%202013%20Rules%20Booklet.pdf|archive-date=4 February 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In North Carolina, the competition has a different format which focuses more on presentation skills. All teams are given the same case which has been written prior to the competition and students are asked to perform role-playing on the case. ''North Carolina Elementary School Mock Trial Competition'' uses the winning entries from New Jersey Law Fair in the prior year as the cases for students to perform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2012 Elementary School Mock Trial Competition|url=http://lre.ncbar.org/programs/elementary-mock-trial-competition|publisher=North Carolina Bar Association|accessdate=29 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228180514/http://lre.ncbar.org/programs/elementary-mock-trial-competition|archive-date=28 December 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another format is to follow the standard format similar to the high school level but with less technical restriction. All teams are given the same material related to a case and prepare for the competition. Two teams compete in a live mock trial to represent two sides of the case. This format is used in the ''New Hampshire Bar Association's Mock Trial Competition''. However, the first round of the competition is done by video submission where each team performs in both sides of the case. The qualified teams will be invited to the live competition with each team on each side of the case.&lt;ref name="nh"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mock Trial Competition Handbook|url=http://www.nhbar.org/uploads/pdf/LRE-MT-CompetitionHandbook.pdf|publisher=New Hampshire Bar Association’s Law-Related Education Program|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Middle school=====
Although there is no national competition for middle/junior high school level, there are many intrastate competitions held by state/county level organizers:

:&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; With the exception of New Jersey, all competitions have similar format as in high school competitions with some rules relaxed. In New Jersey, the format is similar to the ''New Jersey Law Fair'' at the elementary school level with two specific themes that the teams can choose to develop their cases.

=====High school=====
The mock trial program was started to allow high school students to experience the courtroom in a hands-on role. The mock trials are set up and structured just like a real court, bound by the same rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legalexplorer.com/education/education-mock.asp |title=Mock Trial Education |publisher=Legalexplorer.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can help the students to know exactly what role each of the different people in a court (judges, lawyers, witnesses, etc.) do in the judicial system. High school competitions are even held in functional court rooms in the local City Hall to lend additional authenticity to the trial. Cases typically have to do with problems faced by teens, and will usually involve teenagers as witnesses. Each year the case for pre-Nationals competitions alternates between a [[Civil case]] and a [[Criminal case]].

[[File:Mock trial team - Benet Academy.JPG|right|thumb|A high school mock trial team in [[Illinois]]]]
The [[National High School Mock Trial Championship]] started in 1984.&lt;ref name = "rules"/&gt; This first competition consisted of teams from Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, and Wisconsin.&lt;ref name = "rules"/&gt; The competition since has grown and now is considered to be an All-State tournament. Each year, various participating states around the country take turns hosting the tournament. The 2011 Championship was held in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]  hosted in 2012, [[Indianapolis, Indiana]] hosted in 2013, [[Madison, Wisconsin]] hosted in 2014, and [[Raleigh, North Carolina]] is hosting in 2015. New York State does not participate in the national competition; rather, it has its own intrastate competition consisting of over 350 teams throughout the state. It follows similar rules to that of the national competition. New York has three levels of play, county competition, regional competition, and the finals, which is held in [[Albany, New York]] in May. The state of Maryland also does not compete in the National High School tournament, and thus has their own [[Maryland High School Mock Trial Competition|statewide mock trial competition]] similar to that of New York. New Jersey and North Carolina both pulled out of the NHSMTC competition following the 2005 season due to a refusal by the organization to accommodate an Orthodox Jewish team, Torah Academy of Bergen County, that had won New Jersey's state championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nysba.org/Content/NavigationMenu/Public_Resources/Law,_Youth_and_Citizenship/Mock_Trial_Tournament/Mock_Trial_Tournament.htm |accessdate=October 17, 2006 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both states rejoined in 2010 after their concerns regarding accommodation had been addressed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalmocktrial.org/about/history-and-winners/&lt;/ref&gt;

Each state has its own case every year that is different from the national case. This means that the winners of the state competitions, who move on to nationals, must study and prepare a completely different case in time for the National High School Mock Trial Competition in May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legalexplorer.com/education/education-mock.asp |title=Law-related Education: Mock Trial main |publisher=Legalexplorer.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The national competition is governed by National Mock Trial Championship, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalmocktrial.org |title=National High School Mock Trial Championship, Inc |publisher=Nationalmocktrial.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====College=====
Inter-collegiate mock trial is governed by the American Mock Trial Association or AMTA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collegemocktrial.org |title=American Mock Trial Association |publisher=Collegemocktrial.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This organization was founded in 1985 by Dean Richard Calkins of Drake Law School and serves as a regulator of mock trial competition at the collegiate level.  AMTA sponsors regional and national-level competitions, writes and distributes case packets and rules, and keeps a registry of mock trial competitors and alumni.&lt;ref name="cooke1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cooke |first=Jason |title=American Mock Trial Association |url=http://www.collegemocktrial.org/welcome/welcome.php |accessdate=2012-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222093720/http://www.collegemocktrial.org/welcome/welcome.php |archivedate=2012-02-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The case packet is generally written and distributed prior to the scholastic year in August, and case changes are made throughout the season, usually in September, December, and finally in February after Regional competitions and prior to the Opening Round of Championships. Approximately 600 teams from over 350 universities and colleges will compete in AMTA tournaments.  In total, AMTA provides a forum for over 5,300 undergraduate students each academic year to engage in intercollegiate mock trial competitions across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegemocktrial.org/about-amta/history-/|title=History of AMTA|publisher=American Mock Trial Association|accessdate=2013-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the inter-collegiate circuit, a mock trial team consists of three attorneys and three witnesses on each side of the case (plaintiff/prosecution and defense). The attorneys are responsible for delivering an opening statement, conducting direct and cross examinations of witnesses and delivering closing arguments. Witnesses are selected in a [[draft (sports)|sports draft]] format from a pool of approximately eight to 10 available witnesses prior to the round. Typical draft orders are DPDPDP, PPPDDD, or DDPPPD but this may vary substantially between cases. Witnesses may be available only to the plaintiff/prosecution, only to the defense, or to both sides of the case. Witnesses consist of both experts as well as lay witnesses. Judges are usually attorneys or coaches, and in some occasions, practicing judges.

All collegiate mock trial cases take place in the fictional state of Midlands, USA.  Midlands is not geographically situated and falls under the protection of the United States Constitution.&lt;ref name="cooke1"/&gt;

======Tournament competition======
A tournament consists of four rounds, two on each side of the case, typically scored by two to three judges in each round.  The season runs in two parts: the invitational season and the regular season. Invitational tournaments are held throughout the fall semester and into early spring across the country.  At invitationals, teams have the opportunity to test out particular case theories and improve as competitors before facing the challenge and pressure of regular season competition.

The regular season begins in late January, starting with regional tournaments. There are typically more than 600 teams spread across 24 regional tournaments. Each school is limited to two post-regional bids to the "Opening Round Championship Series." Though there were once direct bids from Regionals to the National Championship Tournament, these bids no longer exist. 192 teams advance to the Opening Round Championship, which is held at eight different tournament sites. The top teams at each Opening Round Championship Tournament qualify for a berth in the National Championship Tournament. There are 48 total bids to the final tournament.

For 22 years, the National Championship Tournament was held in [[Des Moines, Iowa]], the city in which collegiate mock trial began. The tournament left Iowa for the first time in 2007 when [[Stetson University]] in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]] hosted the Championship. The 2008 National Championship Tournament was held in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]]. Between 2009-2011, the Championship returned to Des Moines in odd-numbered years, while even-numbered years featured a different venue. The 2010 Championship was hosted by [[Rhodes College]] at courthouses in downtown [[Memphis, Tennessee]], while the 2012 Championship was held in Minneapolis.  Beginning in 2013, future Championships will be awarded solely on a competitive bidding process, although Des Moines, if it bids, will be given preference during "landmark" years, such as anniversaries of AMTA's founding in 1985.  The 2013 Championship was held in [[Washington, D.C.]] with the [[University of Virginia]] handling hosting duties.  The 2014 Championship was held in [[Orlando, Florida]] at the [[Orange County Courthouse (Florida)|Orange County Courthouse]], with the [[University of Central Florida]] serving as the host institution. The 2015 Championship was hosted by the [[University of Cincinnati]], with trials held at the [[Hamilton County Courthouse (Ohio)|Hamilton County Courthouse]] in [[Cincinnati]]. The 2016 Championship was hosted by Furman University in Greenville, South Carolina. In 2017, the Championship tournament will be hosted by the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] in the [[Los Angeles County Superior Court]] (Stanley Mosk Courthouse) in downtown LA.

======Past championship results======
In 2006, the University of Virginia beat Harvard University to win the National Championship.&lt;ref name="cav"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cavalierdaily.com/CVArticle.asp?ID=26730&amp;pid=1430 |title=Mock Trial team wins national championship |accessdate=September 18, 2007 |publisher=The Cavalier Daily |year=2006 |author=Jacqueline Minneman, Cavalier Daily Associate Editor |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310182406/http://www.cavalierdaily.com/CVArticle.asp?ID=26730&amp;pid=1430 |archivedate=March 10, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In what was the closest final round in AMTA history, the University of Virginia won the championship by a single point using a tiebreaker, after a three judge panel split with one judge choosing Virginia as the winner, one choosing Harvard, and one calling the round a draw. The University of Virginia's victory ended the then-recent run by UCLA, which had won the two previous national championships.

In 2007, the University of Virginia again defeated Harvard University. This marked the first ever re-match of a previous year's final round. Virginia again won via a split decision, winning two of the three ballots in the final round. Virginia also became the 4th school to repeat as champions, joining UCLA, the University of Iowa, and Rhodes College, which accomplished the feat twice. Harvard University became the second program to finish as runner up in consecutive years, joining the University of Maryland, College Park. Maryland, however, had the distinction of losing to themselves in one of those two defeats.

In 2008, the University of Maryland prevailed over the George Washington University in a split-ballot decision (2-1). This was Maryland's fifth title, giving them more total wins than any other university in AMTA history.

In 2009, Northwood University defeated George Washington University 5-0 to claim its first National Championship.

In 2010, New York University defeated Harvard University 3-1-1 to win its first National Championship. This was Harvard's third championship round appearance in the last five years following its consecutive losses to Virginia.

In 2011, UCLA defeated defending champion New York University 4-1 to claim the Bruins' third title, the third-most in the history of the American Mock Trial Association.

In 2012, Duke defeated Rutgers 2-1, in what was the first championship round appearance for both squads.

In 2013, Florida State University defeated Rhodes College in FSU's first championship round appearance by a 4-1 ballot decision. This was Rhodes' eighth championship round appearance to date.  2013 also marked the first year that the National Championship Tournament had 3 scoring judges per round (instead of 2).

In 2014, UCLA defeated Princeton University in a 3-2 ballot decision.  With this victory, UCLA tied Rhodes for the second-highest record of championships (4 wins), behind University of Maryland, College Park (5 wins).  This round was also Princeton's first championship round appearance.

In 2015, Harvard defeated Yale in a 4-0-1 ballot decision.  This marked Harvard's first championship win, despite having been the runner-up 3 times previously (in 2006, 2007, and 2010).  2015 also marked Yale's first championship round appearance.  Finally, 2015 marked the first year that the case problem for the National Championship Tournament was different from the case schools had been using in competition for the earlier elimination rounds.  (I.e. In the past colleges had argued the same case all year long, but starting in 2015 any team that qualified for the championship tournament was given a brand new case to learn and argue in the span of just a few weeks.)

In 2016, Yale won its first national championship in an 11-3-1 ballot decision, defeating the University of Virginia in the final trial. Yale is one of only nine schools to have competed in the final trial of the National Championship Tournament two years in a row.  2016 also marked the first year that the National Championship Tournament had 5 scoring judges per round, and 15 scoring judges in the final championship round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegemocktrial.org/about-amta/history-/national-championship-trial-results/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Virginia defeated Yale in a 6-1 ballot decision in a rematch of the 2016 final. Yale's appearance marked the first time in collegiate championship history the same school has appeared three consecutive times in the final championship round.

In 2018, Miami University of Ohio defeated Yale in a 4-3 ballot decision. This was Miami's second championship, the first having been in 2001. Yale extended its record of consecutive championship round appearances to 4, having been the champion in 2016 and the runner-up in 2017 and 2015.

* From 1992 until 2010, the "Maryland Rule" was in effect, which placed both teams from the same school in the same division in order to ensure there wouldn't be another championship round between two teams from the same school. The Maryland Rule was repealed before the 2010-11 season.

======Forums and social media======
Beyond merely competitive interactions, collegiate mock trial has established a presence in cyberspace. Some mock trial teams have created forums for themselves on [[Facebook]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=facebook:  Stanford Mock Trial|url=https://www.facebook.com/groups/2200023395/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=facebook:  Miami Mock Trial|url=http://www.facebook.com/groups/2200142332/?ref=ts}}&lt;/ref&gt; and spoofs of characters from various cases have even made their way onto Facebook with their very own profiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=facebook:  Joey Davis|url=https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100001739776485}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=facebook:  Brett Miller|url=http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100001742140118}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, the American Mock Trial Association has a [[Twitter]] feed which provides updates on procedures and tournament results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Twitter:  College Mock Trial @AMTAMockTrial|url=https://twitter.com/amtamocktrial}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most notable presence of collegiate mock trial on the internet is Perjuries [http://www.perjuries.com], the national online mock trial community. On Perjuries, mock trial competitors, coaches, and alumni can create user accounts and post in a wide range of forums about mock trial and mock trial related issues.  Here, participants can discuss everything from case strategy to incidents in competition that they found humorous.  Furthermore, Perjuries provides a space for competitors to post tournament results and rank their competition.  The site is wildly popular boasting over 5,000 registered users, 2,000 discussions, and nearly 88,000 posts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Perjuries.com|url=http://www.perjuries.com/forums/forum.php|access-date=2012-02-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307045832/http://www.perjuries.com/forums/forum.php|archive-date=2012-03-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Law school=====
In the United States, law schools participate in interscholastic mock trial/trial advocacy. Teams typically consist of several "attorneys" and several "witnesses" on each side. A round consists of two law students acting as "attorneys" for each side.

The trial typically, although not always, begins with motions in limine and housekeeping matters, then moves through opening statements, witness testimony (both direct examination and cross examination), and finishes with a closing argument, sometimes called a summation. Throughout the trial, rules of evidence apply, typically the Federal Rules of Evidence, and objections are made applying these rules.

Every team in a tournament is given the same "problem" or "case", typically several months in advance, but for some tournaments only a few weeks ahead of the tournament's start. The problems can be criminal or civil, which affects many procedural aspects of the trial, for instance the increased rights of a criminal defendant not to testify against himself. The cases are written in an attempt to create an equal chance of either side prevailing, since the main objective is not to identify the winner of the case, but rather the team with superior advocacy skills.

Occasionally the winners of mock trial tournaments receive special awards such as money or invitations to special events, but the status of winning a tournament is significant in and of itself.

In addition, a university may require a mock trial course or courses as a requirement for graduation; among such universities is [[Baylor Law School]], whose third-year Practice Court courses are mandatory for all students and have been since the school's reopening in the 1920s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4681">An '''oral law''' is a [[code of conduct]] in use in a given [[culture]], [[religion]] or community application, by which a body of rules of human behaviour is transmitted by [[oral tradition]] and effectively respected, or the single rule that is orally transmitted.

Many cultures have an oral law, while most contemporary legal systems have a formal written organisation. The oral tradition (from the [[Latin]] ''tradere'' = to transmit) is the typical instrument of transmission of the oral codes or, in a more general sense, is the complex of what a culture transmits of itself among the generations, "from father to son". This kind of transmission can be due to lack of other means, such as in illiterate or criminal societies, or can be expressly required by the same law.

There has been a continuous debate over oral versus written transmission, with the focus on the perceived higher reliability of written evidence,&lt;ref&gt;Finnegan, 195-201&lt;/ref&gt; primarily based on the "linear world of academia" where only written down records are accepted. However, "standard" theories of orality and literacy have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;Goody, pp.27-68&lt;/ref&gt;

== Oral law in jurisprudence ==
From a legal point of view, an oral law can be:
*a [[Habituation|habit]], or [[convention (norm)|custom]] with legal relevance or when the formal law expressly refers to it (but in this latter case, it is properly an indirect source of legal [[rights]] and [[Law of obligations|obligation]]s);
*a spoken command  or order that has to be respected as a [[law]] (in most modern western legal systems, some dispositions can be issued by word in given cases of emergency).
An oral law, intended as a body of rules, can be admitted in [[jurisprudence]] as long as it shows some efficacy, therefore it needs that the law is public, the human action is evaluated by a [[judge]] (ordinarily producing a [[Sentence (law)|sentence]] according to the general interpretation of the law) and then a [[punishment]] has eventually to be put into effect. Some oral laws provide all these elements (for instance, some codes of conduct in use among criminal associations like [[the Mafia]] do have a well known law, a judge, a condemnation), while others usually miss some of them.

== Oral law in Judaism ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Halakha]] --&gt;
{{main|Oral Torah}}

Although the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] term "[[Torah]]" is often translated as "Law", it can just as accurately be translated as "Instruction" or "teaching".  [[Rabbinic Judaism]] maintains that the books of the [[Tanakh]] were transmitted in parallel with an oral tradition, as relayed by God to Moses and from him handed on to the scholarly and other religious leaders of each generation.  Thus, in Judaism, the "Written Instruction" (''Torah she-bi-khtav'' תורה שבכתב) comprises the Torah and the rest of the [[Tanakh]]; the "Oral Instruction" (''Torah she-be'al peh'' תורה שבעל פה) was ultimately recorded in the [[Talmud]] (lit. "Learning") and [[Midrash]]im (lit. "Interpretations").  The interpretation of the [[Oral Torah]] is thus considered as the authoritative reading of the [[Tanakh|Written Torah]]. Further, [[Halakha]] (lit. "The Path", frequently translated as "Jewish Law") is based on a "Written Instruction" together with an "Oral Instruction". Jewish law and tradition is thus not based on a literal reading of the Tanakh, but on the combined oral and written tradition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4280">An '''organic law''' is a [[law]], or system of laws, that form the foundation of a [[government]], [[corporation]] or any other organization's body of rules. A [[constitution]] is a particular form of organic law for a sovereign state.
==By country==
===France===
Under the current [[Constitution of France]], organic laws are a short, fixed list of statutes (in 2005, there were about 30 of them), whose existence is provisioned by the text of the Constitution itself. According to the framing of the French Constitution (especially its [[Constitution of France#Impact with respect to personal freedoms|preambles]]), they are of constitutional scope and have constitutional force and so overrule ordinary statutes. They are enacted by the [[Parliament of France]] in the same way except that the [[Constitutional Council of France]] must be consulted before any organic law is enacted.

Organic laws allow flexibility if needed. An important category is the legislative process for enacting the budgets of the [[Cabinet of France#Budget|French state]] and French [[social security]]. Other organic laws give the practical procedures for various [[election]]s. They reduce the need for amendments to the constitution.

===Spain===
{{Main|Organic Law (Spain)}}
Under the current [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|Constitution of 1978]], an Organic Law has an intermediate status between that of an ordinary law and of the constitution itself. It must be passed by an absolute majority of the [[Congress of Deputies (Spain)|Congress of Deputies]]. The Spanish Constitution specifies that some areas of law must be regulated by this procedure, such as the laws developing fundamental rights and freedoms recognized in the first section of Chapter Two of Title I of the Constitution, as well as the laws that approve the [[Statute of Autonomy|Statutes of Autonomy]] of the [[autonomous communities of Spain]], among others. Prior to the 1978 constitution, the concept did not exist in Spain, but it is inspired by the similar concept in the 1958 French Constitution.

===United States===
{{see also|Organic act}}

The organic laws of the United States of America can be found in Volume One of the United States Code which contains the general and permanent laws of the United States. [[U.S. Code]] (2007)&lt;ref&gt;[http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/organiclaws.txt 2007 U.S. Code] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205190815/http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/organiclaws.txt |date=2010-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; defines the organic laws of the United States of America to include the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776]], the [[Articles of Confederation|Articles of Confederation of November 15, 1777]], the [[Northwest Ordinance|Northwest Ordinance of July 13, 1787]], and the [[US Constitution|Constitution of September 17, 1787]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=L-Y4AAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage#PPR23,M1 U.S. Code]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/organiclaws.txt 2007 Publication of the U.S. Code including the organic laws] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205190815/http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/organiclaws.txt |date=2010-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Perpetual copyright''' can refer to a [[copyright]] without a finite [[copyright term|term]], or to a copyright whose finite term is perpetually extended.  Perpetual copyright in the former sense is highly uncommon, as the current laws of all countries with copyright statutes set a standard limit on the duration, based either on the date of creation/publication, or on the date of the creator's death.  (See [[List of countries' copyright lengths]].)  Exceptions have sometimes been made, however, for unpublished works. Usually, special legislation is required, granting a perpetual copyright to a specific work. 

In many countries, [[moral rights]], which may be covered under the copyright law, can last perpetually.

== Copyright philosophy ==
The basic philosophical argument employed by proponents of perpetual copyright presupposes that [[intellectual property]] ownership rights are analogous to other property rights such as those associated with material goods.  Proponents such as [[Samuel Clemens]]&lt;ref&gt;"Remarks of Samuel Langhorne Clemens Before the Congressional Joint Committee on Patents (December 1906)."  Quoted in LaForge, William N. (2010).  ''Testifying Before Congress.'' p. 199. TheCapitol.Net. {{ISBN|9781587331725}}.  Clemens stated in testimony before Congress, "So if I could have convinced that gentleman that a book which does consist solely of ideas, from the base to the summit, then that would have been the best argument in the world that it is property, like any other property, and should not be put under the ban of any restriction, but that it should be the property of that man and his heirs forever and ever, just as a butcher shop would be, or--I don't care--anything, I don't care what it is. It all has the same basis. The law should recognize the right of perpetuity in this and every other kind of property."&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jack Valenti]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Patry| first = William |title = Moral Panics and the Copyright Wars | publisher = Oxford University Press | page = 110 | year = 2009| ISBN = 9780195385649}} Valenti stated before a congressional committee that "Creative property owners must be accorded the same rights and protection resident in all other property owners in the nation."&lt;/ref&gt;  have stated that owners of intellectual property should have the same perpetual right to retain and bequeath this property to their descendants that owners of material goods already possess. [[Jonathan Zittrain]], a faculty co-director at the [[Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society]], illustrated this argument using the analogy:  "[It] makes no sense to imagine somebody after a certain time coming in and taking your rug or your chair and saying 'Sorry, your ownership expired.'"&lt;ref&gt;Wentworth, Donna. [http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/mickey.htm "Mickey Rattles the Bars: the Supreme Court Hearing of Eldred v. Ashcroft"], [[Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society]], Harvard, 9 October 2002.  Retrieved on 7 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an op-ed published in ''[[The New York Times]]'', author [[Mark Helprin]] argues that it is unjust for a government to strip copyright holders of their exclusive rights after a set period of time.&lt;ref name = "Helprin"&gt;Helprin, Mark. [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/20/opinion/20helprin.html?pagewanted=all "A Great Idea Lives Forever. Shouldn’t Its Copyright?"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', New York, 20 May 2007.  Retrieved on 7 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  He also writes that copyright expiration transfers wealth from private copyright holders to corporations:

{{quote|"'Freeing' a literary work into the public domain is less a public benefit than a transfer of wealth from the families of American writers to the executives and stockholders of various businesses who will continue to profit from, for example, ''[[The Garden Party (short story collection)|The Garden Party]]'', while the descendants of [[Katherine Mansfield]] will not."&lt;ref name = "Helprin"/&gt;}}

Calls for perpetual copyright have been widely criticized.  [[Lawrence Lessig]] organized a community response to Helprin's editorial.&lt;ref&gt;Lessig, Lawrence.  [http://wiki.lessig.org/index.php/Against_perpetual_copyright "Against Perpetual Copyright"], The Lessig Wiki.  Retrieved on 7 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Public Knowledge]] issued a response which argued that copyright expiration ultimately provides a net benefit to society.&lt;ref name="Sherwin"&gt;Siy, Sherwin.  [http://www.publicknowledge.org/node/958 "Why Copyrights Must Expire: a reply to Mark Helprin"] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20120107202004/http%3A//www.publicknowledge.org/node/958 |date=7 January 2012 }}, [[Public Knowledge]], 21 May 2007.  Retrieved on 7 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  It distinguishes intellectual property rights from those associated with material goods; the latter "are scarce and rivalrous: [they] cannot be created anew, and only a limited number of people can occupy and use a space at any one time.  Copyrighted works are neither scarce nor rivalrous: books are created anew, by specific authors, and can be read by five million people as easily as by five dozen, depriving none of them, nor the author, of the ability to use the work."&lt;ref name = "Sherwin"/&gt;  Critics state that copyright expiration does not deprive a creator's heirs of the right to continue to appreciate and use the works of that creator as though a government had legally confiscated their physical possessions after a set period of time.   Society as a whole is granted the same right to appreciate and exploit the property that once was under the exclusive control of a single family or corporate entity.  This wider potential for the creative exploitation of works formerly under the exclusive control of a copyright owner promotes learning.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell QC, Iain G (2009) [http://www.ifosslr.org/ifosslr/article/view/23 'Back to the Future: Hinton v Donaldson, Wood and Meurose (Court of Session, Scotland, 28 July 1773)'], ''International Free and Open Source Software Law Review'', 1(2), 111 – 122.  The British judge Lord Kames wrote that "...if the monopoly of [book printing] was to be perpetual, it would be a sad case for learned men, and for the interest of learning in general: it would enhance the price of books far beyond the reach of ordinary readers."&lt;/ref&gt;  Public Knowledge and other critics wrote that existing [[copyright terms]] already provide more than sufficient compensation for creators of intellectual property. It has also been argued that copyright should not become a [[welfare]] system used to benefit remote descendants who happen to come into possession of a valuable copyright through the [[lottery of birth]], and that society is a "quite important heir" to copyrighted works.&lt;ref&gt;Desai, Deven R., Copyright's Hidden Assumption: A Critical Analysis of the Foundations of Descendible Copyright (27 April 2009). Thomas Jefferson School of Law Research Paper No. 1353746. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1353746&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of perpetual copyright also point out that creative activity often involves the creation of [[derivative works]] that recast or build upon previous material.  If this prior material were perpetually copyrighted, their respective copyright holders would have the indefinite right to license their intellectual property or deny its use as they see fit.  Many new derivative works could not be produced if the interested parties were denied permission or could not afford the licensing fees.  Moreover, the longer copyright persists, the more copyrighted material falls into the category of [[orphan works]].&lt;ref&gt;Varian, Hal R., Copyright Term Extension and Orphan Works (December 2006). Industrial and Corporate Change, Vol. 15, Issue 6, pp. 965-980, 2006. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1116430 or {{doi|10.1093/icc/dtl026}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Anyone seeking to create derivative works based upon orphan works faces the risk of copyright infringement if the copyright holders were to come forward at some later time to enforce their rights.  Perpetual copyright would create a significant disincentive to the creation of new literary or artistic works which build upon older material.

== Battle of the booksellers ==
When the statutory [[copyright term]] provided for by the [[Statute of Anne]], the first [[copyright]] statute, began to expire in 1731 London booksellers fought to defend their dominant position by seeking [[injunction]]s from the [[Court of Chancery]] for works by authors that fell outside the statute's protection. At the same time the London booksellers lobbied parliament to extend the copyright term provided by the Statute of Anne. Eventually, in a case known as ''Midwinter v. Hamilton'' (1743–1748), the London booksellers turned to [[common law]] and started a 30-year period known as the ''battle of the booksellers''. The battle of the booksellers saw London booksellers locking horns with the newly emerging Scottish book trade over the right to reprint works falling outside the protection of the Statute of Anne. The Scottish booksellers argued that no [[common law copyright]] existed in an author's work. The London booksellers argued that the Statute of Anne only supplemented and supported a pre-existing common law copyright. The dispute was argued out in a number of notable cases, including Millar v. Kincaid (1749–1751) and Tonson v. Collins (1761–1762).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Ronan | first = Deazley| title = Rethinking copyright: history, theory, language| publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing| year = 2006| pages = 14| url = https://www.google.com/books?id=dMYXq9V1JBQC&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-1-84542-282-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A debate raged on whether printed ideas could be owned and London booksellers and other supporters of perpetual copyright argued that without it scholarship would cease to exist and that authors would have no incentive to continue creating works of enduring value if they could not inherit the property rights to their descendants. Opponents of perpetual copyright argued that it amounted to a [[monopoly]], which inflated the price of books, making them less affordable and therefore prevented the spread of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. London booksellers were attacked for using rights of authors to mask their greed and self-interest in controlling the book trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Van Horn Melton| first = James| title = The rise of the public in Enlightenment Europe| publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 2001| pages =139| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=QZovusQ1SjYC&amp;dq=%22perpetual+copyright%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn =978-0-521-46969-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Keen | first = Paul| title = Revolutions in Romantic literature: an anthology of print culture 1780-1832 | publisher = Broadview Press| year = 2004| pages =80| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qVBvcohS5v0C&amp;dq=%22perpetual+copyright%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn =978-1-55111-352-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When ''[[Donaldson v Beckett]]'' reached the [[House of Lords]] in 1774 [[Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden|Lord Camden]] was most strident in his rejection of the common law copyright, warning the Lords that should they vote in favour of common law copyright, effectively a perpetual copyright, "all our learning will be locked up in the hands of the Tonsons and the Lintots of the age". Moreover, he warned that booksellers would then set upon books whatever price they pleased "till the public became as much their slaves, as their own hackney compilers are". He declared that "Knowledge and science are not things to be bound in such cobweb chains."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Ronan | first = Deazley| title = Rethinking copyright: history, theory, language| publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing| year = 2006| pages = 19| url = https://www.google.com/books?id=dMYXq9V1JBQC&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-1-84542-282-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In its ruling the House of Lords established that copyright was a "creature of statute", and that the rights and responsibilities in copyright were determined by legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Rimmer| first = Matthew| title = Digital copyright and the consumer revolution: hands off my iPod | publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing | year = 2007| pages = 4| url = https://www.google.com/books?id=1ONyncVruj8C&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright+scotland&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-1-84542-948-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; By confirming that the [[copyright term]] (that is the length of time a work is in copyright) did expire according to statute, the Lords also affirmed the [[public domain]]. The ''Donaldson v Beckett'' ruling confirmed that a large number of works and books first published in Britain were in the public domain, either because the copyright term granted by statute had expired, or because they were first published before the [[Statute of Anne]] was enacted in 1709. This opened the market for cheap reprints of works from [[William Shakespeare]], [[John Milton]] and [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], works now considered classics. The expansion of the public domain in books broke the dominance of the London booksellers and allowed for competition, with the number of London booksellers and publishers rising threefold from 111 to 308 between 1772 and 1802.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Van Horn Melton| first = James| title = The rise of the public in Enlightenment Europe| publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 2001| pages =140–141| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=QZovusQ1SjYC&amp;dq=%22perpetual+copyright%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn =978-0-521-46969-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, calls for perpetual copyright continued in Britain and France until the mid-19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Torremans| first = Paul| title = Copyright law: a handbook of contemporary research| publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing| year = 2007| pages = 154| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=wHJBemWuPT4C&amp;dq=%22perpetual+copyright%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-1-84542-487-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Common law copyright ===
After ''Donaldson v Beckett'', disagreement continued over whether the House of Lords affirmed the existence of [[common law copyright]] before it was superseded by the Statute of Anne. The Lords had traditionally been hostile to the booksellers' monopoly and were aware of how the doctrine of [[common law copyright]], promoted by the booksellers, was used to support their case for a perpetual copyright. The Lords clearly voted against perpetual copyright,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Marshall| first = Lee| title = Bootlegging: romanticism and copyright in the music industry| publisher = Sage| year = 2006| pages = 15| url =https://www.google.com/books?id=25luX89BlA0C&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright+scotland&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-7619-4490-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually an understanding was established whereby authors had a pre-existing common law copyright over their work, but that with the Statute of Anne parliament had limited these natural rights in order to strike a more appropriate balance between the interests of the author and the wider social good.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Ronan | first = Deazley| title = Rethinking copyright: history, theory, language| publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing| year = 2006| pages = 24| url = https://www.google.com/books?id=dMYXq9V1JBQC&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-1-84542-282-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Patterson and Livingston there remains confusion about the nature of copyright ever since. Copyright has come to be viewed both as a natural law right of the author and as the statutory grant of a limited [[monopoly]]. One theory holds that copyright's origin occurs at the creation of a work, the other that its origin exists only through the copyright statute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Jonathan| first = Rosenoer| title = Cyberlaw: the law of the internet| publisher = Springer| year = 1997| pages = 34–35| url = https://www.google.com/books?id=HlG2esMIm7kC&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-387-94832-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1834 the [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] ruled in [[Wheaton v. Peters]], a case similar to the British [[Donaldson v Beckett]] of 1774, that although the author of an unpublished work had a [[common law copyright|common law right]] to control the first publication of that work, the author did not have a common law right to control reproduction following the first publication of the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| editor-last = Yu| editor-first = Peter K.| title = Intellectual Property and Information Wealth: Copyright and related rights| publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group| year = 2007| pages = 143| url = https://www.google.com/books?id=tgK9BzcF5WgC&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-275-98883-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== United Kingdom ==
The Copyright Act of 1775 established a type of perpetual copyright which allowed "the Two Universities in England, the Four Universities in Scotland, and the several colleges of Eton, Westminster, and Winchester to hold in Perpetuity their Copy Right in Books given to or bequeathed to the said Universities and Colleges for the advancement of useful learning and other purposes of education."&lt;ref&gt;Macgillivary, E.J. (1902). [https://archive.org/details/treatiseuponlawo00macguoft ''A Treatise Upon the Law of Copyright''], p.358.  John Murray. London.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a consequence of this Act,{{fact|reason=Do we have a source that it is THIS Act?  The Wikipedia article on King James Version seems to have a slightly different narrative.|date=October 2018}} the [[Authorized King James Version|Authorized or King James Version of the Bible]] was allowed to be printed only by the Royal printer and by the printers of the Universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]. All provisions granting copyright in perpetuity were abolished by the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 but under transitional arrangements these printing rights do not fully expire until 2039.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48 |title=Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 |quote=Schedule 1, Section 13 (1): The rights conferred on universities and colleges by the Copyright Act 1775 shall continue to subsist until the end of the period of 50 years from the end of the calendar year in which the new copyright provisions come into force and shall then expire.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J. M. Barrie]]'s [[Peter and Wendy|Peter Pan]] (including the play ''Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up'' and its novelisation ''Peter and Wendy'') is covered by special legislation granting [[Great Ormond Street Hospital]] a right to royalties in perpetuity from commercial exploitation of the story on stage, in publication, and in broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48|title=Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (c. 48, s. 301)|publisher=[[Office of Public Sector Information]], [[United Kingdom]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is not a perpetual copyright because the hospital does not retain creative control over the work, which entered the public domain in the UK in 2008, 70 years after the author's death. This legislation does not apply to other works which feature Peter Pan such as ''[[The Little White Bird]]'' or ''[[Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens]]'', which are also in the public domain.

== United States ==

In the [[United States]], perpetual copyright is prohibited by its [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], which provides that copyright is "for limited times". However, it neither specifies how long that term can be, nor does it impose any restriction on the number of times the term may be extended. Indeed, since the enactment of the [[Copyright Act of 1790]], copyright term has been successively extended by [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] on four occasions, retroactively extending the terms of any copyrights still in force.  Following the enactment of the [[Copyright Term Extension Act]] in 1998, a coalition of plaintiffs led by publisher [[Eric Eldred]] argued that this act and a [[Copyright Act of 1976|previous extension of the copyright term]] in the 1970s had created a ''de facto'' "perpetual copyright on the installment plan".  This argument was rejected by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] in ''[[Eldred v. Ashcroft]]'', which held that there was no limit to how many times the term of copyright may be extended by Congress, so long as it is still a limited term at the time of each extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Eldred_v._Ashcroft|title=Eldred v. Ashcroft|year=2003|publisher=[[Supreme Court of the United States]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[State law (United States)|State]] and [[common law]] have granted perpetual copyright in certain special cases not covered by federal copyright law.  Sound recordings made before 1972 are under the jurisdiction of state copyright laws&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Federal Copyright Protection for Pre-1972 Sound Recordings | publisher=U.S. Copyright Office | date=28 December 2011 | url=http://www.copyright.gov/docs/sound/ | accessdate=11 August 2012}} Changes made to federal law since 1972 ensure that it will ultimately supersede all statutes in state law governing sound recording copyrights: "Current law provides that pre-1972 sound recordings may remain protected under state law until February 15, 2067."&lt;/ref&gt; which provide perpetual protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Harbeson |first=Eric |title=Comments submitted on behalf of The Music Library Association (MLA) | publisher=U.S. Copyright Office | date=31 January 2011 | url=http://www.copyright.gov/docs/sound/comments/initial/20110131-Eric-Harbeson-Music-Library-Ass'n.pdf | accessdate=11 August 2012}} "Prior to the 1976 Copyright Act, pre-1972 sound recordings enjoyed a truly perpetual copyright term.  No state that we know of had enacted any limitation on the copyright term of sound recordings."&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to 1 January 1978, when the [[Copyright Act of 1976]] came into effect, [[unpublished|unpublished works]] were protected by common law, which recognized perpetual copyright in these works for as long as they remained unpublished.&lt;ref name = "unpublished"&gt;{{cite web |title=Certain Unpublished, Unregistered Works Enter Public Domain | publisher=U.S. Copyright Office | date=13 January 2003 | url=http://www.copyright.gov/pr/pdomain.html | accessdate=11 August 2012}} "Under the 1909 Copyright Act, works that were neither published nor registered did not enjoy statutory protection, although they were protected under common law in perpetuity as long as they remained unpublished and unregistered."&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1976 Copyright Act exerted federal jurisdiction over unpublished works for the first time and all copyrights in these works were assigned a fixed term even if they remain unpublished.

== Singapore ==
Pursuant to Section 197 of the Copyright Act, unpublished governmental literary, dramatic and musical works are under perpetual copyright, but once published, they are copyrighted for 70 years following publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/non_version/cgi-bin/cgi_getdata.pl?actno=2006-REVED-63&amp;doctitle=Copyright%20Act%0a&amp;segid=1138345608-006559#1138345608-006621|title=Copyright Act (c. 63, s. 197) - Provisions as to Government copyright|publisher=[[Attorney-General of Singapore|The Attorney-General’s Chambers]], [[Singapore]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10221">'''Political globalization''' refers to the growth of the worldwide [[political system]], both in size and complexity. That system includes [[Government|national government]]s, their [[governmental organizations|governmental]] and [[intergovernmental organizations]] as well as government-independent elements of [[global civil society]] such as [[international non-governmental organizations]] and [[social movement organization]]s. One of the key aspects of the political globalization is the declining importance of the [[nation-state]] and the rise of other actors on the political scene. The creation and existence of the [[United Nations]] has been called one of the classic examples of political globalization.

Political globalization is one of the three main dimensions of globalization commonly found in academic literature, with the two other being [[economic globalization]] and [[cultural globalization]].&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-146"&gt;{{cite book|author=Salvatore Babones|editor=George Ritzer|chapter=Studying Globalization: Methodological Issues|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKnmvRATtfAC&amp;pg=PA146|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
[[Salvatore Babones]] discussing sources used by scholars for studying political globalizations noted the usefulness of [[Europa World Year Book]] for data on diplomatic relationships between countries, publications of [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]] such as ''The Military Balance'' for matters of military, and US government publication ''Patterns of Global Terrorism'' for matters of terrorism.&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-152"&gt;{{cite book|author=Salvatore Babones|editor=George Ritzer|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|chapter=Studying Globalization: Methodological Issues|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKnmvRATtfAC|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political globalization is measured by aggregating and weighting data on the number of embassies and high commissioners in a country, the number of the country's membership in international organization, its participation in the UN peacekeeping missions, and the number of international treaties signed by said country. This measure has been used by [[Axel Dreher]], [[Noel Gaston]], [[Pim Martens]] [[Jeffrey Haynes]] and is available from the [[KOF institute]] at [[ETH Zurich]]&lt;ref name="Haynes2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffrey Haynes|title=Religion and Political Change in the Modern World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8z-DCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT64|date=7 September 2015|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-69699-5|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Welfens2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul J.J.

==Aspects==
[[Dimensions of globalization|Like globalization itself]], political globalization has several dimensions and lends itself to a number of interpretations. It has been discussed in the context of new emancipatory possibilities, as well as in the context of loss of autonomy and fragmentation of the social world.&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-414"/&gt; Political globalization can be seen in changes such as [[democratization]] of the world, creation of the global [[civil society]],&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-426"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gerard Delanty|author2=Chris Rumford|editor=George Ritzer|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|chapter=Political Globalization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKnmvRATtfAC|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|page=426}}&lt;/ref&gt; and moving beyond the centrality of the [[nation-state]], particularly as the sole actor in the field of politics.&lt;ref name="Steger2003-56"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MooneyEvans2007"/&gt; Some of the questions central to the discussion of the political globalization are related to the future of the nation-state, whether its importance is diminishing and what are the causes for those changes; and understanding the emergence of the concept of [[global governance]].&lt;ref name="Steger2003-57"&gt;{{cite book|author=Manfred B.

[[David Held]] has proposed that continuing political globalization may lead to the creation of a [[world government]]-like [[cosmopolitan democracy]], though this vision has also been criticized as too idealistic.&lt;ref name="Steger2003-68"&gt;{{cite book|author=Manfred B.

==Political Globalization and Nation State==
There is a heated debate over Political Globalization and Nation State. The question arises whether or not political globalization signifies the decline of the nation-state. Hyper globalists argue that globalization has engulfed today's world in such a way that state boundaries are beginning to lose significance. However, skeptics disregard this as naiveté, believing that the nation-state remains the supreme actor in international relations. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://internationalaffairsbd.com/political-globalization-nation-state/|title=Contemporary Debate on Political Globalization and Nation StateYeg=PA68|author=|first=|last2=|date=2017|publisher=International Affairs, UK|year=|isbn=978-0-19-153938-1|location=|page=68|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposed '''National Unification Promotion Law of the People's Republic of China''' ({{zh|s=中华人民共和国国家统一促进法|t=中華人民共和國國家統一促進法}}) is a document that appeared in early 2004 as a suggestion to create formal a legal basis for the [[People's Republic of China]]'s [[Chinese reunification|reunification]] with [[Taiwan]].  It was authored by a Chinese scholar Yu Yuanzhou (余元州), a professor from the [[Jianghan University]] in [[Wuhan]] who does not have a formal governmental position.  Although no formal legislative action has been taken on the document, it was widely discussed in China. The reactions to the proposed document was mixed, with some, mainly in Taiwan, saying it provided evidence of hostile intent on the part of the PRC, while others praising it for proposing flexible solutions to the intractable conflict.

This proposal has not been directly incorporated in the bill (which later passed into law). None of the policies (e.g. the federal policy, or a new currency, see below) appeared in the final, official anti-secession law of the PRC.

Although Taiwan was ceded to Japan in the treaty of Shimonoseki ratified in 1895 – then surrendered by Japan in 1945 to the [[Kuomintang]] Administration – the PRC government considers [[Taiwan]] to be the 23rd province of the People's Republic of China. The historical claim is based on the formal incorporation of Taiwan into the Qing empire in 1680. From the political perspective, according to the PRC argument, the government of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] ceased to be legitimate following its retreat to Taiwan in 1949, and thus all sovereignty and governmental authority in China was automatically transferred to the PRC, including that of Taiwan which was then under ROC administration. The official ROC line counters that it did not cease to exist in 1949 and has continued to function as a sovereign political entity on Taiwan to the present day, making the relation between the PRC and ROC similar to that between other states similarly partitioned (such as [[North Korea]] and [[South Korea]]). The PRC's position has been acknowledged by most other nations but not formally recognized, as most nations prefer to take an ambiguous approach on the issue. See [[Political status of Taiwan]].

Since 1949, the PRC government has demanded that Taiwan unify under the PRC, and has reserved the right to use military force to compel Taiwan to do so if necessary. However, opinion polls conducted in Taiwan have indicated that there is very little support for unification on the PRC's terms, even among those who favor eventual unification, making peaceful unification unlikely for the foreseeable future. With the reelection of [[Chen Shui-bian]] to the ROC Presidency, and the growth of [[Taiwan independence]] sentiment, a new Taiwanese identity appears to be emerging on the island as opposed to identification with China. In 2008, the [[KMT]] regained both the presidency and the legislature with a pair of election victories over the [[Democratic Progressive Party|DPP]].

In a string of unsuccessful efforts to change Taiwanese public opinion, several propositions and leaks from PRC governmental organs expressed consideration for a law aiming to formalize the policy for [[Chinese reunification]] between [[mainland China]] and Taiwan under the authority of the PRC. This culminated in May 2004, when [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]] [[Wen Jiabao]] pronounced to a group of Chinese expatriates in [[London]] that serious consideration of such a law would be taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peacehall.com/news/gb/intl/2004/05/200405112113.shtml|title=温家宝:认真考虑制定统一法  博讯新闻，简体中文新闻|website=www.peacehall.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several days later, Yu's suggestion (similar to a [[green paper]]) emerged.

==Provisions of the initial proposal by Yu Yuanzhou==
The draft document has 31 articles, organized in 8 chapters.  Its provisions touch mostly [[constitution|constitutional law]].

Article 2 establishes Taiwan as the "'''Taiwan Special Political Area of PRC''', or Taiwan SPA of PRC for short" ({{zh|t=中華人民共和國台灣特別政治區|s=中华人民共和国台湾特别政治区}}); this appears to be an [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China|administrative division]] of the PRC distinct from the [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|Special Administrative Region]] espoused by the PRC government for Taiwan.  Curiously, it allows Chinese people loyal (or having affinity) to the [[Republic of China]] to transiently view the mainland as "'''The Mainland Special Political Area of ROC''', or The Mainland SPA of ROC" (中華民國大陸特別政治區). Article 3 reiterated the PRC's aim to implement the '[[one country, two systems]]' policy for Taiwan, which would be brought into reality with military force if necessary.

Article 8 exempts Taiwan from any PRC imposed taxes. Chapter 3 proposes the establishment of a new, common [[currency]] called the '''Chinese dollar''' set by [[fiat currency|fiat]] to be worth 0.1 [[gram]]s of [[gold]] forever.

Two methods of unification are laid out as options: Constitutional arrangement for '''peaceful unification''' is contained in Chapter 4: the [[Constitution of the Republic of China]] which is used in Taiwan is said to be obsolete; a [[federation]] is proposed. Chapter 5 provides the legal basis for '''non-peaceful ([[Military of China|military]]) methods of unification'''.  The conditions for the use of armed force are set out, and explicitly states that the PRC may not limit itself to the use of conventional weapons, implying the use of [[weapons of mass destruction]]. Article 18 also stipulates that Taiwan will be subject to attack should it defy policy set by the PRC government.

Chapter 6 provides for honours for those promoting unification, whereas Chapter 7 sets out criminal penalties against separatism—limited to acts carried out within Chinese territory, and acts carried out anywhere by Chinese residents in the Mainland, [[Macau]], [[Hong Kong]], and Taiwan.

Article 30, section 1 provides that the law and subsequent changes thereof are to be carried out by the [[National People's Congress]] and signed into force by the [[President of the People's Republic of China]]—parenthetically, 'Head of State', probably to infer the possibility of a different position once the law takes effect; section 2 provides that permanent sections of the law cannot be changed unless later agreements contain promises that are 'more favourable' (更加优惠, but the beneficiary is unspecified); section 3 states that the law is lower than the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China]] but higher than any other laws of the land.

==Reaction==
[[President of the Republic of China|The ROC President]] [[Chen Shui-bian]] has expressed serious concerns about this proposal, and has expressed doubts that the Taiwanese public would find it acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ttnn.com/cna/news.cfm/040730/74 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040813185202/http://www.ttnn.com/cna/news.cfm/040730/74 |archivedate=2004-08-13 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; Chen also pointed out that the law being proposed is mostly intended as a measure to legitimize the PRC's military threats against the ROC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news1.yam.com//chinatimes/focus/news/200409/20040903075456.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303225044/http://news1.yam.com//chinatimes/focus/news/200409/20040903075456.html |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the proposed law would incriminate anyone holding opinions other than those supporting PRC policy on the question of reunification. Under the law dissidents would be prosecuted under charges of treason, retroactively effective up to 100 years, raising serious questions about [[freedom of speech]] and [[civil liberties]]. Chen stated that the law would only serve to increase the feelings of animosity of the Taiwanese people towards the PRC and increase tensions.

It is worth noting that the PRC's "[[one country, two systems]]" policy has been shown to be approved by less than 10% of Taiwan residents in multiple recent opinion polls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epochtimes.com/b5/1/7/4/n106193.htm|title=台灣外交部民調：一國兩制 七成五民眾反對 - 大紀元|date=4 July 2001|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, many people also questioned how a proposed PRC law could be applied onto a territory over which the PRC does not have [[jurisdiction]]. Even though few states formally recognize the ROC as an independent country, most prefer to remain ambiguous over the matter. The [[Political status of Taiwan]] is still an ongoing multilateral dispute.

It has been unclear as to the degree to which this law is or was ever taken seriously by PRC authorities. The law
was proposed by an individual without any governmental authority, and no formal action on the law has ever been taken by the [[National People's Congress]]. After summer 2004, references to the proposed law on both sides of the straits became rare, leading many to conclude that it was released by the PRC mainly to gauge public opinion. Shortly after this proposal, the PRC enacted the [[Anti-Secession Law]].

{{Communication}}
{{Performing arts}}
'''Public speaking''' (also called '''oratory''' or '''oration''') is the process or act of performing a good [[Speech communication|speech]] to a live [[audience]]. This type of speech is deliberately structured with three general purposes: to inform, to persuade and to entertain. Public speaking is commonly understood as formal, face-to-face speaking of a single person to a group of listeners.&lt;ref&gt;''General Purposes of Speaking''. 2012books.lardbucket.org. Retrieved 2016-11-04.{{ISBN needed}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public speaking can be governed by different rules and structures. For example, speeches about concepts do not necessarily have to be structured in any special way. However, there is a method behind giving it effectively. For this type of speech it would be good to describe that concept with examples that can relate to the audiences life. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Speaker The Tradition and practice of public speaking|last=Valenzano III|first=Joseph M.|last2=Braden|first2=Stephen W.|publisher=Fountainhead press|year=2012|isbn=978-1-59871-522-4|location=United States of America|pages=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
There are five basic elements of public speaking that are described in [[Lasswell's model of communication]]: the communicator, message, medium, audience and effect. In short, the speaker should be answering the question "''who'' says ''what'' in which ''channel'' to ''whom'' with what ''effect''?"

Public speaking can serve the purpose of transmitting information, telling a story, motivating people to act or some combination of those. Public speaking can also take the form of a [[discourse community]], in which the audience and speaker use discourse to achieve a common goal.

Public speaking for business and commercial events is often done by professionals. These speakers can be contracted independently, through representation by a [[speakers bureau]], or by other means. Public speaking plays a large role in the professional world; in fact, it is believed that 70 percent of all jobs involve some form of public speaking.&lt;ref&gt;Schreiber, Lisa.

However, the most significant records are found among the ancient Greeks.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first known piece&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, James J.  [https://www.britannica.com/biography/Demosthenes-Greek-statesman-and-orator "Demosthenes – greatest Greek orator".] ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; on oratory, written over 2,000 years ago, came from ancient Greece. This work elaborated on principles drawn from the practices and experiences of ancient Greek orators. [[Aristotle]] was one of the first recorded teachers of oratory to use definitive rules and models. His emphasis on oratory led to oration becoming an essential part of a [[liberal arts]] education during the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]]. The [[classical antiquity]] works written by the ancient Greeks capture the ways they taught and developed the art of public speaking thousands of years ago.

In classical [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], [[rhetoric]] was the main component of [[Composition studies|composition]] and speech delivery, both of which were critical skills for citizens to use in public and private life. In ancient Greece, citizens spoke on their own behalf rather than having professionals, like modern lawyers, speak for them. Any [[citizen]] who wished to succeed in court, in politics or in social life had to learn techniques of public speaking. Rhetorical tools were first taught by a group of rhetoric teachers called [[Sophists]] who are notable for teaching paying students how to speak effectively using the methods they developed.

Separately from the Sophists, [[Socrates]], [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] all developed their own theories of public speaking and taught these principles to students who wanted to learn skills in rhetoric. Plato and Aristotle taught these principles in schools that they founded, [[Platonic Academy|The Academy]] and [[Aristotles Lyceum|The Lyceum]], respectively. Although Greece eventually lost political sovereignty, the Greek culture of training in public speaking was adopted almost identically by the Romans.

In the political rise of the [[Roman Republic]], Roman orators copied and modified the ancient Greek techniques of public speaking. Instruction in rhetoric developed into a full curriculum, including instruction in grammar (study of the poets), preliminary exercises ([[progymnasmata]]), and preparation of public speeches (declamation) in both [[Forensic linguistics|forensic]] and [[Deliberative rhetoric|deliberative]] genres.

The Latin style of rhetoric was heavily influenced by [[Cicero]] and involved a strong emphasis on a broad education in all areas of [[Humanities|humanistic study]] in the liberal arts, including philosophy. Other areas of study included the use of wit and humor, the [[Pathos|appeal to the listener's emotions]], and the use of [[digression]]s. Oratory in the [[Roman empire]], though less central to political life than in the days of the Republic, remained significant in law and became a big form of entertainment. Famous orators became like celebrities in ancient Rome—very wealthy and prominent members of society.

The Latin style was the primary form of oration until the beginning of the 20th century. After [[World War II]], however, the Latin style of oration began to gradually grow out of style as the trend of ornate speaking became seen as impractical. This cultural change likely had to do with the rise of the [[scientific method]] and the emphasis on a "plain" style of speaking and writing. Even formal oratory is much less ornate today than it was in the Classical Era.

Despite the shift in style, the best-known examples of strong public speaking are still studied ''years'' after their delivery. Among these examples are [[Pericles' Funeral Oration]] in 427 BCE addressing those that died during the [[Peloponnesian War]]; Abraham Lincoln's [[Gettysburg Address]] in 1863; Sojourner Truth's identification of racial issues in "[[Ain't I a Woman?]]”; and Mahatma Gandhi's message of nonviolent resistance in India, which in turn inspired Martin Luther King, Jr.'s "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech at the Washington Monument in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;German, Kathleen M. (2010). ''Principles of Public Speaking''. Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon. p. 6. {{ISBN|978-0-205-65396-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tools ==
In addition to simple oratory skills, tools and technologies have been created which allow for more methods of communication for speakers and public orators. [[Lectern]]s hold papers while speakers talk. A speaker can project his or her voice with the aid of a [[public address system]] or a [[microphone]] and [[loudspeaker]] when speaking in front of a large audience. Public speakers may also use [[audience response systems]], allowing listeners to interact with the speech as it happens.

Telecommunication and [[videoconferencing]] are also a form of public speaking. David M. Fetterman of [[Stanford University]] wrote in his 1997 article ''Videoconferencing over the Internet'': "Videoconferencing technology allows geographically disparate parties to hear and see each other usually through satellite or telephone [[communication]] systems." This technology is helpful for large conference meetings and face-to-face communication between parties without demanding the inconvenience of travel.

The '''rights of Englishmen''' are the perceived traditional rights of citizens of England. In the 18th century, some of the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|colonists who objected to British rule]] in the [[Thirteen Colonies|British colonies in North America]] argued that their traditional{{sfnp|Zuckert|2003}} rights as [[Englishmen]] were being violated. The colonists wanted and expected the rights that they (or their forebears) had previously enjoyed in England: a local, representative government, with regards to judicial matters (some colonists were being sent back to England for trials) and particularly with regards to taxation.{{sfnp|Tindall |1984}} Belief in these rights subsequently became a widely-accepted justification for the [[American Revolution]].{{sfnp|Swindler|1976}}{{sfnp|Miller|1959}}

The American colonies had since the 17th century been fertile ground for liberalism within the center of European political discourse.{{sfnp|Heale|1986}} However, as the ratification of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] approached, the issue among the colonists of which particular rights were significant became divisive. [[George Mason]], one of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]], stated that "We claim nothing but the liberty and privileges of Englishmen in the same degree, as if we had continued among our brethren in Great Britain."{{sfnp|Miller|1959}}

==Historical background== 
{{Further information|Fundamental Laws of England}}
[[File:Sir William Blackstone from NPG.jpg|alt=|thumb|18th-century English jurist William Blackstone attempted to explain the rights of English citizens.]]
In the tradition of [[Whig history]], Judge [[William Blackstone]] called them "The absolute rights of every Englishman", and explained how they had been established slowly over centuries of [[English history]], in his book on ''[[Fundamental Laws of England]]'', which was the first part of his influential ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]''.&lt;ref name=Blackstone&gt;[[William Blackstone|Blackstone]], ''[[Fundamental Laws of England]]'', the first part of ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', pp. 123–24. Scanned in text available at [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/blackstone_bk1ch1.asp Yale Law School Libraries online]. Retrieved 26 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; They were certain basic rights that all subjects of the [[English monarch]] were understood to be entitled to,&lt;ref name="Blackstone"/&gt; such as those expressed in [[Magna Carta]] since 1215, the [[Petition of Right]] in 1628, the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1679]] and the [[Bill of Rights 1689]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Billias|first1=George Athan|title=American constitutionalism heard round the world, 1776–1989: a global perspective|date=2011|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780814725177|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ku0TCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA54&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjpnefZzqfMAhXC1hoKHcjFAG0Q6AEIOjAG#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a legal case in 1608 that came to be known as ''[[Calvin's Case]]'', or the ''Case of the Postnati'', the [[Law Lords]] decided in 1608 that [[Scotsmen]] born after [[King James I]] united [[Scotland]] and England (the ''postnati'') had all the rights of Englishmen. This decision would have a subsequent effect on the concept of the "rights of Englishmen" in British America.{{sfnp|Price|1997}}{{sfnp|Hulsebosch|2003}}{{sfnp|Pearson|2005}}

Some scholars believed that the case did not fit British America's situation, and thus reasoned that the 18th-century colonists could "claim all the rights and protections of English citizenship."&lt;ref name=Pearson&gt;{{cite book | author = Ellen Holmes Pearson | chapter = Revising Custom, Embracing Choice: Early American Legal Scholars and the Republicanization of Common Law | editor = Eliga H.

==Legacy in United States law==
Owing to its inclusion in the standard legal treatises of the 19th century,{{efn|Compiled by [[Edward Coke]], [[William Blackstone]], and [[James Kent]].}} ''Calvin's Case'' was well known in the early judicial history of the United States.{{sfnp|Hulsebosch|2003}} Consideration of the case by the [[United States Supreme Court]] and by state courts transformed it into a rule regarding American citizenship and solidified the concept of ''[[jus soli]]''&amp;nbsp;– the right by which nationality or citizenship can be recognised to any individual born in the territory of the related state&amp;nbsp;– as the primary determining factor controlling the acquisition of citizenship by birth.{{sfnp|Price|1997|pages=138–39}}

The Supreme Court Justice [[Joseph P. Bradley]] asserted that the "rights of Englishmen" were a foundation of American law in his dissenting opinion on the [[Slaughter-House Cases]], the first Supreme Court interpretation of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], in 1873.{{efn|In his dissenting decision, Bradley wrote:{{quote|The people of this country brought with them to its shores the rights of Englishmen, the rights which had been wrested from English sovereigns at various periods of the nation's history.... England has no written constitution, it is true, but it has an unwritten one, resting in the acknowledged, and frequently declared, privileges of Parliament and the people, to violate which in any material respect would produce a revolution in an hour. A violation of one of the fundamental principles of that constitution in the Colonies, namely, the principle that recognizes the property of the people as their own, and which, therefore, regards all taxes for the support of government as gifts of the people through their representatives, and regards taxation without representation as subversive of free government, was the origin of our own revolution.}}}}

The '''Treaty on the Protection of Artistic and Scientific Institutions and Historic Monuments''' or '''Roerich Pact''' is an inter-American [[treaty]]. The most important idea of the Roerich Pact is the [[legal recognition]] that the defense of [[cultural objects]] is more important than the use or destruction of that culture for military [[defense (military)|purposes]], and the protection of culture always has precedence over any [[military necessity]].

== Nicholas Roerich ==
{{main|Nicholas Roerich}}
[[File:N Roerich.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Nicholas Roerich]].]]

Russian painter and philosopher [[Nicholas Roerich]] (1874–1947)&lt;ref&gt;[[Leslie Brenner]], "Nicholas Roerich. Idealist and Visionary", ''[[Foreign Affairs Journal]]'', April 1990&lt;/ref&gt; initiated the modern movement for the defense of cultural objects, for the idea of "Peace of Civilizations". Besides the recognition as one of the greatest Russian painters, Roerich's most notable achievement during his lifetime was the Roerich Pact signed on 15 April 1935 by the representatives of [[International Conference of American States|American states]] in the [[Oval Office]] of the [[White House]] (Washington, DC). It was the first international treaty signed in the Oval Office.&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Stoumatoff, ''FDR's Unfinished Portrait: A Memoir'', University of Pittsburgh Press, 1990, {{ISBN|0-8229-3659-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicholas Roerich was born on 9 October 9, 1874, in [[St. Petersburg]]. His parents encouraged him to study law, but seeing their son's inclination for painting, they allowed him to study both, which he did with much success. In 1900, Roerich went to [[Paris]] to take lessons from [[Fernand Cormon]], the well known tutor of [[Van Gogh]] and [[Toulouse-Lautrec]]. Upon his return to St. Petersburg, he married [[Helena Roerich|Helena Shaposhnikova]], who later developed the [[Agni Yoga]] philosophy. Soon Roerich became quite a successful painter. One of his paintings was purchased by Russian [[Tsar Nicolas II]] himself. Roerich also worked as stage and costume designer for several operas and ballets by [[Maurice Maeterlinck]] and [[Igor Stravinsky]], premiered in St. Petersburg.

In 1917 Roerich went to live near a lake in [[Grand Duchy of Finland|Finland]], to strengthen his health. After the border between Russia and Finland was closed in 1918 in the context of the [[October Revolution]] and [[Finnish Civil War]], the family travelled across several [[Scandinavia]]n countries to [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] and eventually left for [[North America]] in 1920. There, Roerich founded two cultural institutions: "[[Cor Ardens]]" (Flaming Heart, a fraternity of artists from several countries) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corardens.com/|title=Scripture Speaks - Savoring the deep meaning of the Word of God which unfolds each year in the liturgy, revealing the fundamental mysteries of our faith.|website=Corardens.com|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "The Master Institute of United Arts" (an organization for education, science, and philosophy).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roerich.org/roerich-biography.php|title=Nicholas Roerich biographical outline|website=Roerich.org|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, the [[Roerich Museum]] was founded in New York. In 1929, it moved to a new building. Presently, the Roerich Museum is located in [[Manhattan]], at the corner of 107th Street and Riverside Drive. In 1929, Roerich's work towards the pact was recognised through a nomination for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/redirector/?redir=archive/show.php&amp;id=5885 Nobel Prize Committee archives 1929]&lt;/ref&gt;.


After leaving America, the Roerichs settled at Naggar in the [[Kullu Valley]] from which their estate looked towards the [[Himalayas]]. Here they established the [[Urusvati Institute]] which remains in Naggar with an exhibition about the pact. Nicholas Roerich died of a cardiac arrest on 13 December 1947.

== Origins of the Roerich Pact ==
An idea about the protection of [[cultural monuments]] was formulated for the first time by N.K. Roerich in 1899. During his excavations at [[Saint Petersburg Governorate|Saint-Petersburg province]], Roerich began to point to the necessity of protection of cultural monuments, which reproduce a world-view of ancient people for us.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

In 1903, Roerich together with his wife Helena Ivanovna Roerich toured through forty ancient Russian cities, including [[Yaroslavl]], [[Kostroma]], [[Kazan]], [[Nizhny Novgorod]], [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]], [[Suzdal]], [[Yuryev-Polsky (town)|Yuriev-Polsky]], [[Smolensk]], [[Vilnius]], [[Izborsk]] and [[Pskov]]. In 1904, proceeding the expedition, N.K.Roerich has visited [[Uglich]], [[Kalyazin]], [[Kashin (town)|Kashin]] and [[Tver]]. During these travels Roerich created a large series of architectural studies, created near 90 paintings of the visited sites. Later many Russian churches were destroyed and these paintings remain the only documenting images.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Summarizing this trips, the painter admired the beauty of the ancient monuments. Roerich, expressing his feelings for the state of their protection, in his article "Along the old times" (1903): "Last summer I had an occasion to see many our true antique and little love to it".

In 1904, Roerich gave a report to the Emperor's [[Russian Archeological Society|Russian Archeologist Society]] about the sad state of historical monuments and the necessity to take prompt actions to protect them.

During the [[Russian-Japan war]] (1904–1905), Roerich expressed an idea about the necessity of a special treaty for the protection of institutions and cultural monuments.  In the course of several years after his travel in 1903-1904, Roerich repeatedly pointed out the state of antique monuments. He wrote several articles dedicated to the poor state of the churches. In the article "Silent Pogroms" (1911) Roerich wrote about the unskillful restoration of [[St. John the Forerunner Church at Yaroslavl]]: "Who would defense a beautiful antique from mad pogroms? It is grievously when the antique dies. But it is more terrible when the antique remains disfigured, false, imitation...".

In 1914, Roerich appealed to the high command of the [[Imperial Russian army]], as well as the governments of the [[United States]] and [[Third French Republic|France]] with an idea of conclusion of an international agreement aimed on the protection of cultural values during armed conflicts. He created a poster "Enemy of Mankind" denouncing the barbaric destruction of cultural monuments, and picture "Glow" expressing a protest against [[World War I]].

In 1915, Roerich wrote a report for Russian Emperor [[Nicholas II]] and Great Prince [[Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich of Russia (1856–1929)|Nicholas Nikolayevich]] containing an appeal to make real state measures for national protection of cultural values.

In 1929, Roerich, in cooperation with [[Georgi Shklyaver|G.G. Shklyaver]] (a.k.a. Georges Chklaver), a doctor of [[international law]] and political sciences at [[Paris University]] prepared a project of the Pact for protection of cultural values. Simultaneously Roerich proposed a distinctive sign to identify the objects that are in need of protection – the [[Banner of Peace]]. It represents a white cloth with a red circle and three red circles inscribed in it.

== The Roerich Pact ==
In 1929 Roerich in collaboration with [[Paris University]] professor G.G. Shklyaver  (a.k.a. Georges Chklaver) prepared a draft of an international treaty dedicated to protection of cultural values. The scheme was to be a cultural analog to the [[Red Cross]] for medical neutrality.

In 1930, text of draft agreement with accompanying Roerich's appeal to governments and peoples of all countries was published in press and distributed in government, scientific, artistic and educational institutions of the whole world. As a result, the committees supporting the Pact were established in many countries. The draft pact was approved by Committee for Museum affairs at [[League of Nations]] and also by the Committee of the [[Pan-American Union]]. Ultimately, the Pact was signed by 21 states in the Americas and was ratified by ten of them.

In the [[aftermath of World War II]], the Roerich Pact played an important role in forming of international law standards and public activity in the field of protection of cultural heritage. In 1949, at the fourth [[UNESCO]] General Conference, a decision was accepted to begin the work for international law regulation in the field of cultural heritage protection in case of armed conflict.

Ideas of Roerich Pact still are not implemented in the [[international law]], especially its principle of the almost unlimited preference of the preservation of cultural values to the military necessity.

== The Banner of Peace ==
{{main|Banner of Peace}}
[[File:Pax cultura.svg|thumb|100px|right|The Pax Cultura emblem.]]
[[File:Pax-roerix-50.jpg|thumb|200px|right|50 years of the Roerich Pact]]

"''Pax Cultura''" ("Cultural Peace" or "Peace through Culture") is the motto of the cultural artifact protection movement founded by Nicholas Roerich, and is symbolized by a maroon on white emblem consisting of three solid circles in a surrounding circle. On April 15, 1935 the Roerich Pact was signed by the [[United States]] and [[Latin America]]n nations, agreeing that "historic monuments, museums, scientific, artistic, educational and cultural institutions" should be protected both in times of peace and war, and identified by their flying a distinctive flag, the ''Banner of Peace'', bearing the Pax Cultura emblem.

According to the Roerich Museum, "The Banner of Peace symbol has ancient origins. Perhaps its earliest known example appears on Stone Age amulets: three dots, without the enclosing circle. Roerich came across numerous later examples in various parts of the world, and knew that it represented a deep and sophisticated understanding of the triune nature of existence. But for the purposes of the Banner and the Pact, Roerich described the circle as representing the totality of culture, with the three dots being Art, Science, and Religion, three of the most embracing of human cultural activities. He also described the circle as representing the eternity of time, encompassing the past, present, and future. The sacred origins of the symbol, as an illustration of the trinities fundamental to all religions, remain central to the meaning of the Pact and the Banner today."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roerich.org/nr.html?mid=pact ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roerich Pact sign was superseded by the distinctive marking of cultural property as defined by the [[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict|Hague Convention of 1954]]. However, the emblem of the Roerich Pact is still a valid protective sign in the relations between the ten states which are bound by the Pact.

== The Roerich Pact importance for the 21st century ==
The Roerich Pact is not only a relatively short multilateral treaty: it is a conglomerate of legal ideas about a new state order in which the state and the culture closely overlap. A measure of this complexity is the share of state [[budget]] annually spent on culture, art and
education, which in many countries exceeds military expenses.

Important in the framework of ideas of the Roerich Pact is the recognition that the safety of any foreign cultural object on the territory of a foreign state must be also respected and treated as a factor much higher in significance than military willingness to bomb, destroy or use it for military purposes.

Nicholas Roerich managed to continue and develop into a profound and feasible doctrine the famous maxim proclaimed by [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], "Beauty will save the World!" Hence starts a very powerful Russian movement in the development of the concept of aesthetical statehood. The concept of the state as a work of art was first suggested in the 19th century by [[Jacob Burckhardt]], who was Swiss historian of art, specializing in Italian [[Renaissance]], and who gave this name to a chapter of one of his books. The concept itself had not been formulated to a completion and was expressed in a general idea that period, as well as their rulers, considered the achievements in culture and art as most important for securing the prestige both of their states and their own, which finally resulted in the unique Italian Renaissance art, literature, philosophy and science. Roerich produced ideas based on the approaches used by Burkhardt and Dostoevsky.

Roerich, considered the care for future generations to be a cornerstone of the existence of the [[rule of law]] and the constitutional state. President of the USA, Franklin D. Roosevelt, in the speech upon the signature of the 'Roerich Pact' Treaty said: "In opening this Pact to the adherence of the Nations of the world, we are endeavoring to make of universal application one of the principles vital to the preservation of modern civilization. This Treaty possesses a spiritual significance far deeper than the text of the instrument itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosophicalclub.ru/content/docs/75th_Anniversary_of_Roerich_Pact_Eng.html Barenboim P., Sidiqi N. ''Bruges, the Bridge between Civilizations: The 75th Anniversary of the Roerich Pact'']. М., Letny Sad; Grid Belgium, 2010. {{ISBN|978-5-98856-114-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to realize that the Roerich Pact was only the first step towards the future development of a new legal culture. All written laws must conform to the universal unwritten principles of morality, fairness, and justice, equality, autonomy, dignity, and respect that is known as a higher law theory.&lt;ref&gt;Rule of Law article in the West's Encyclopedia of American Law&lt;/ref&gt; The concrete conceptual provisions of Roerich's philosophical and legal concept of the state are based on the one of [[Rule According to Higher Law]] ideas that the primary duty of the state is to sustain and develop the spiritual unity of its citizens, by carefully preserving the best specimens of national cultural heritage, promoting universal culture and spiritual growth of all people, especially the young ones. At that, the major share of profits received by the state should be directed at the development of culture, which, as it was already mentioned, would lead to a further growth of economical prosperity.

According to Roerich's concept, the state, as an instrument for the preservation and development of culture, the instrument defending both domestic and foreign cultural treasures, the instrument maintaining peace and avoiding wars, the instrument building a new civilization, based on the best cultural traditions of today and, therefore, spending the utmost economically reasonable assets for these purposes — all this can be explicitly and exclusively based on constitutional foundation.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barenboim, Naeem Sidiqi, Op.cit. p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis R. Elbinger, "The Unifying Power of Art", in Foreign Service Journal, April 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

== World League of Culture and World Day of Culture ==
In the broad sense the Roerich Pact is understood as not only a legal treaty but also as a whole complex of measures for the protection of cultural values suggested by N. Roerich. Consequently, the Roerich Pact has not only legal but also philosophic, enlightening, and evolutional significance since it reflects an idea of cultural protection in its many manifestations.

Characterizing the Roerich Pact, cosmonaut [[Alexey Leonov|A.A. Leonov]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If we are raising a culture and spirituality then it will help us to strengthen an economics, to make the policy moral and to stop the military conflicts. This is a significance of the Roerich Pact today. The more time is passed the more actual for the world it becomes. …&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Developing the Pact ideas N. Roerich has stated the thoughts about a role of community. The laws for culture protection in itself will not work if the community will not display an activity and interest to this. Later this thought was supported by academician [[Dmitry Likhachov|D.S. Likhachev]]. He said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;… I believe that the best and freely developing social forms of culture can unite creative constructive forces and improve a social life, thereby help the state to maintain high ideals of humanism and peacefulness in the people. …&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the first international conference of Roerich Pact in Bruges (September, 1931), N. Roerich proposed to create a World League of Culture. One of main aims of the League must be to train care of the nature.

In his article "Pain of the Planet" (1933) N. Roerich wrote: "The call about culture, call about the world, and call about creativity and beauty reaches the ear which is strengthen by true values only. Understanding of life as self-improving for the people's good arises where the respect of the nature is valid. Therefore, the League of Culture together with main enlightener activity must wholesale explain a wise regard for the nature as an origin of merry work, wise joy, continuous cognition and creativity".

The cultural community highly appreciates N. Roerich's thought about the implementation of [[Universal Day of Culture|World Day of Culture]]. N. Roerich wrote:
"… We shall hear about the world Day of Culture too when at all schools and enlightener societies simultaneously the day will dedicated to comprehension of the national and world cultural treasures…"

:''See [[Rogation days]] for usage pertaining to the Christian calendar of the Western Church.''

In [[Constitution of the Roman Republic|Roman constitutional law]], '''''rogatio''''' is the term (from [[Latin]]  ''rogo'', "ask, place a question before") for a [[Bill (proposed law)|legislative bill]] placed before an [[Legislative Assemblies of the Roman Republic|Assembly of the People]] in ancient Rome. The ''rogatio'' procedure underscores the fact that the [[Roman senate]] could issue decrees, but was not a legislative or [[parliament]]arian body. Only [[SPQR|the People]] could pass legislation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fergus Millar]], ''The Crowd in Rome in the Late Republic'' (University of Michigan Press, 1998), pp. 157–158 [https://books.google.com/books?id=YVBNzYQy5vYC&amp;pg=PA157&amp;dq=%22it+was+only+by+the+people+that+legislation+could+be+passed%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0#v=onepage&amp;q=%22it%20was%20only%20by%20the%20people%20that%20legislation%20could%20be%20passed%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Roman magistrate|magistrate]] with the right to summon the assembly could propose a bill (''rogatio legis''); the proposed laws themselves were ''leges rogatae''. A bill's proposer was its ''lator''; a supporter was an ''auctor''.&lt;ref&gt;Millar, ''The Crowd in Rome'' p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Discussions in the senate would contribute to the drafting of a bill, which would be published (''promulgare rogationem'', that is, ''[[promulgation|promulgatio]]'') three weeks or more before it was formally submitted to the assembly. During this period, citizens could discuss the bill and propose changes, or more rarely ask for its withdrawal, at informal sessions (''contiones''). After the bill had been brought before the assembly for the vote, it could no longer be modified.&lt;ref&gt;George Mousourakis, ''The Historical and Institutional Context of Roman Law'' (Ashgate, 2003), p. 182 [https://books.google.com/books?id=8qE1zFHyGXoC&amp;pg=PA182&amp;dq=rogatio&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1990&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=2009&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=rogatio&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The legislator who introduced the bill asked ''Velitis iubeatis, Quirites?'' ("Citizens, are you going to approve and order?"&lt;ref&gt;Or, "Citizens, is it your will that you should order it?"&lt;/ref&gt;) and the people responded [[yea or nay]] without discussion. If a bill was withdrawn after the ''rogatio'' but before the vote was taken, it was usually because a [[tribune]] threatened to use his veto power against it, or less frequently because it proved unpopular among the ''[[plebs]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Lintott]], ''Judicial reform and land reform in the Roman Republic'' (Cambridge University Press, 1992), pp. 6–7 [https://books.google.com/books?id=bcc9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=rogatio+OR+rogation+inauthor:Lintott&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1990&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=2009&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=rogatio%20OR%20rogation%20inauthor%3ALintott&amp;f=false online.] Lintott believes [[Cicero]] exaggerates the extent to which the ''plebs'' could influence withdrawal.&lt;/ref&gt; If a bill was passed (''rogatio lata est''), it became a law (''[[Roman law|lex]]'') after the presiding magistrate made a formal announcement (''renuntiatio'') of the assembly's decision.

In the Early [[Roman Republic|Republic]], the senate had to approve the constitutionality of a law before it was enacted; after the passage of the ''[[Conflict of the Orders#The end of the Conflict of the Orders (367-287 BC)|Lex Publilia Philonis]]'' in 339 BC, which required that at least one of the two ''[[Roman censor|censores]]'' be a plebeian, this approval (''patrum [[auctoritas]]'') was required before the bill was put to a vote in the assembly. With controversial [[populares|popularist]] measures, however, the senate was sometimes bypassed. 
If a bill was proposed for the purpose of declaring war, it had to be brought before the [[Centuriate Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;Fergus Millar, ''Rome, the Greek World, and the East'' (University of North Carolina Press, 2002), p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

A bill that became law was inscribed on copper or marble tablets and kept in the state treasury (''[[aerarium]] populi romani'') under the supervision of the [[quaestor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Mousourakis, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 63 BC, [[Cicero]] managed to [[Obstructionism|obstruct]] a ''rogatio Servilia'' by making a speech before the people; this appears to be the only time in the Late Republic when oratory blocked a popular piece of legislation, which in this case had provided for the distribution of land to the poor. Or so Cicero claims; the bill's sponsor, the tribune [[Servilius Rullus]], more likely withdrew it because of the threat of veto from one of his fellow tribunes, and it never reached the ''[[comitia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Henrik Mouritsen, ''Plebs and Politics in the Late Roman Republic'' (Cambridge University Press, 2001), pp. 54–55 [https://books.google.com/books?id=8iQQ7Xe2y-wC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=rogatio&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1990&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=2009&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=rogatio&amp;f=false online.] Further discussion of the ''rogatio Servilia'' by [[Erich S. Gruen]], "The ''Plebs'' and the Army," in ''The Last Generation of the Roman Republic'' (University of California Press, 1974, reprinted 1995), pp. 386–398, limited preview [https://books.google.com/books?id=axY9jQzzW9UC&amp;pg=PA396&amp;dq=rogatio&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1990&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=2009&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=rogatio&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1432">The '''''Scholia Sinaitica''''' are fragments of a work of [[Roman law]] written in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], dating between 438 and 529 AD, containing comments to the books 35-38 of [[Ulpian]]'s ''ad Sabinum'' treatise.

The papyrus fragments that show parts of the work were discovered by the Greek scholar [[Gregorios Bernardakis]] in the 19th century in a [[Mount Sinai]] convent.

The scroll is not the work of a single author, but of different authors at different times who are generally thought to be of Eastern origin. The literature suggests that the authors were connected to the [[Law School of Beirut]], they cite numerous works of Roman jurists, texts from imperial constitutions and also the ''[[Codex Gregorianus]]'', the ''[[Codex Hermogenianus]]'' and the ''[[Codex Theodosianus]],'' demonstrating knowledge and availability of legal texts of Roman law broader than that demonstrated by contemporary authors of the [[Western Roman Empire|western part]] of the empire.&lt;ref name="rec"&gt;{{cite book | title=Transactions of the American Philosophical Society | publisher=American Philosophical Society | year=1953 | isbn= 9780871694324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shiffrin argues that although liberalism may preclude legal enforcement of morality for its own sake, the law cannot be indifferent to morality but must promote the social conditions of fostering and sustaining moral agency and moral deliberation.&lt;ref name="Contract &amp; Promise"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shiffrin|first=Seana|title=The Divergence of Contract and Promise|journal=Harvard Law Review|date=January 2007|volume=120|url=http://www.harvardlawreview.org/media/pdf/shiffrin.pdf|accessdate=28 July 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100802143424/http://www.harvardlawreview.org/media/pdf/shiffrin.pdf|archivedate=2 August 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A connected theme she emphasizes is the role of equality and equal social relationships in rendering individual autonomy possible and meaningful.&lt;ref name="Race, labor"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shiffrin|first=Seana|title=Race, labor, and the fair equality of opportunity principle|journal=Fordham Law Review|year=2003|url=http://law2.fordham.edu/publications/articles/500flspub11045.pdf}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  She has pursued these themes predominately through her non-conventionalist account of promising, her controversial argument that contract law should be more sensitive to its relationship to the moral practice of promising, her critique of luck-egalitarian conceptions of egalitarianism as incompatible with liberal freedoms that require accommodation practices, and also through the development of her thinker-based theory of freedom of speech.  She is also cited for her critique of Lockean arguments for intellectual property, for her efforts to develop a non-comparative alternative theory of harm, and for her argument that the federal law authorizing exploitative penalty fees for minor breaches of credit card contracts violates constitutional due process guarantees against disproportionate punitive damages.&lt;ref name="Theories of intellectual property"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fisher|first=William|title=Theories of intellectual property|journal=New essays in the legal and political theory of property|year=2001|url=http://xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/27799060/1918334176/name/iptheory.pdf|accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Statement von GS Kyrle zur Befreiung der Jemen Geiseln (8724149668).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Public figures use [[press conference]]s so often as a way to control the timing and specificity of their messages to the media that press conference facilities have been nicknamed "[[spin room]]s".]]
In [[public relations]] and [[politic]]s, '''spin''' is a form of [[propaganda]], achieved through providing a biased interpretation of an event or campaigning to persuade [[public opinion]] in favor or against some organization or public figure. While traditional public relations and [[advertising]] may also rely on altering the presentation of the facts, "spin" often implies the use of [[Wikt:disingenuous|disingenuous]], [[deceptive]], and highly [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] tactics.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Safire]], "[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/22/magazine/the-spinner-spun.html The Spinner Spun]", ''New York Times'', December 22, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Because of the frequent association between spin and [[press conference]]s (especially [[government]] press conferences), the room in which these conferences take place is sometimes described as a "[[spin room]]".&lt;ref&gt;Michael, Powell. [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/22/us/politics/22scene.html "Tit for Tat on a Night Where Spin Is Master,"] ''New York Times.'' February 22, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Public relations advisors, pollsters and media [[consultant]]s who develop deceptive or misleading messages may be referred to as "'''spin doctors'''" or "'''spinmeisters'''".

As such, a standard tactic used in "spinning" is to reframe, reposition, or otherwise modify the perception of an issue or event, to reduce any negative impact it might have on public opinion. For example, a company whose top-selling product is found to have a significant safety problem may "reframe" the issue by criticizing the safety of its main competitor's products or indeed by highlighting the risk associated with the entire product category. This might be done using a "catchy" [[slogan]] or [[sound bite]] that can help to persuade the public of the company's biased [[point of view (philosophy)|point of view]]. This tactic could enable the company to defocus the public's attention on the negative aspects of its product. {{cn|date=June 2017}}

As it takes experience and training to "spin" an issue, spinning is typically a service provided by paid media advisors and media [[consultant]]s. The largest and most powerful companies may have in-house employees and sophisticated units with expertise in spinning issues. While spin is often considered to be a private sector tactic, in the 1990s and 2000s, some politicians and political staff have been accused by their opponents of using deceptive "spin" tactics to manipulate public opinion or deceive the public. Spin approaches used by some political teams include "burying" potentially negative new information by releasing it at the end of the workday on the last day before a long weekend; selectively [[cherry-picking]] quotes from previous speeches made by their employer or an opposing politician to give the impression that they advocate a certain position; and purposely [[News leak|leaking]] [[misinformation]] about an opposing politician or candidate that casts them in a negative light.{{cn|date=June 2017}}


== History ==
[[Edward Bernays]] has been called the "Father of Public Relations". As [[Larry Tye]] describes in his book ''The Father of Spin: Edward L. Bernays and The Birth of [[Public Relations]]'', Bernays was able to help [[tobacco]] and [[alcohol]] companies use techniques to make certain behaviors more socially acceptable in 20th-century United States. Tye claims that Bernays was proud of his work as a propagandist.&lt;ref&gt;Stauber, John and Sheldon Rampton. [http://www.prwatch.org/prwissues/1999Q2/bernays.html  "Book Review: ''The Father of Spin: Edward L. Bernays &amp; The Birth of PR'' by Larry Tye,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121185416/http://www.prwatch.org/prwissues/1999Q2/bernays.html |date=2008-11-21 }} ''PR Watch'' (Second Quarter 1999). Vol. 6, No. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; As information technology has increased dramatically since the end of the 20th century, commentators like [[Joe Trippi]] have advanced the theory that modern [[Internet activism]] spells the end for political spin. By providing immediate counterpoint to every point a "spin doctor" can come up with, this theory suggests, the omnipresence of the Internet in some societies will inevitably lead to a reduction in the effectiveness of spin.&lt;ref&gt;Branigan, Tania, "[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jun/13/newmedia.egovernment Internet spells end for political spin, says US web guru]", ''[[The Guardian]]''. 12 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Techniques ==
The techniques of spin include:
*[[File:Picking Cherries.jpg|alt=Cherry picking as a farming and a public relations practice.|thumb|Cherry picking is a practice of using selective facts to present to the public. It refers to the farming practice of picking only ripe cherries. ]]Selectively presenting facts and quotes that support one's position ("[[Cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry picking]]"). For example, a pharmaceutical company could pick and choose two trials where their product shows a positive effect, ignoring hundreds of unsuccessful trials, or a politician's staff could handpick short speech quotations from past years which appear to show their candidate's support for a certain position.
* [[Non-denial denial]]
* [[Non-apology apology]]
* "[[Mistakes were made]]" is an example of [[distancing language]] commonly used as a rhetorical device, whereby a speaker acknowledges that a situation was managed by using low-quality or inappropriate handling but evades any direct admission or accusation of responsibility by not specifying the person or organization who made the mistakes. Grammatically, the expression uses the [[English passive voice|passive voice]] to focus on the action while omitting the actor. The acknowledgement of "mistakes" is framed in an abstract sense, with no direct reference to who made the mistakes. The speaker neither accepts personal responsibility nor accuses anyone else. The word "mistakes" also does not imply intent. A less evasive [[active voice]] construction would place the focus on the actor, such as: "I made mistakes" or "John Doe made mistakes." 
* Phrasing in a way that [[Begging the question|assumes unproven claims]], or [[avoiding the question]]&lt;ref&gt;Staff. "[http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningzone/clips/are-these-examples-of-political-spin/7265.html Are these examples of political spin?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815015401/http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningzone/clips/are-these-examples-of-political-spin/7265.html |date=2012-08-15 }}". ''[[BBC Learning Zone]]''. Clip 7265. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Burying bad news": announcing unpopular things at a time when it is believed that the media will focus on other news. In some cases, governments have released potentially controversial reports on summer long weekends, to avoid significant news coverage. Sometimes that "other news" is supplied by deliberately announcing popular items at the same time.
* Misdirection and diversion&lt;ref name=weissman&gt;Weissman, Jerry. "[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jerry-weissman/spin-versus-topspin_b_218103.html Spin vs. Topspin]". ''[[The Huffington Post]]''. 19 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Limited hangout]]

For years, businesses have used fake or misleading [[Testimonial#Customer testimonials|customer testimonials]] by editing/spinning customers to reflect a much more satisfied experience than was actually the case. In 2009, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] updated their laws to include measures to prohibit this type of "spinning" and have been enforcing these laws as of late. {{cn|date=June 2017}}

Several companies that verify the authenticity of the testimonials businesses present on the marketing materials in an effort to convince one to become a customer have arisen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://business.trustedcompany.com/blog/en/testimonials-vs-verified-reviews/]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12744">'''Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld''' (9 August 1879, [[Oakland, California]]{{spaced ndash}}21 October 1918, [[Alameda, California]])&lt;ref&gt;The [[Yale Law Journal]]. Vol. 28, No. 2, Dec., 1918, page 167: [https://www.jstor.org/stable/786851?seq=2 "Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld"].&lt;/ref&gt; was an American [[jurist]]. He was the author of the seminal ''Fundamental Legal Conceptions as Applied in Judicial Reasoning and Other Legal Essays'' (1919).

During his life he published only a handful of law journal articles. After his death the material forming the basis of ''Fundamental Legal Conceptions'' was derived from two articles in the ''[[Yale Law Journal]]'' (1913) and (1917) that had been partially revised with a view to publication. Editorial work was undertaken to complete the revisions and the book was published with the inclusion of the manuscript notes that Hohfeld had left, plus seven other essays.

The work remains a powerful contribution to modern understanding of the nature of [[rights]] and the implications of [[liberty]]. To reflect Hohfeld's continuing importance, a chair at [[Yale University]] is named after him.  The chair is unoccupied as of 2016 but was last held by [[Jules Coleman]], who retired in 2012.

==Career==
Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld was born in California in 1879.  He graduated from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1901.  He went on to [[Harvard Law School]], where he served as editor of the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'', and graduated in 1904 with honors.

From 1905 to 1913 Hohfeld taught at [[Stanford Law School]].  He then moved to [[Yale Law School]], where he taught until his death in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of American Biography 5:124 (Charles Scribner's Sons, New York 1933); Guide to American Law 6:58 (St. Paul, West Publishing 1984); ''see also'' Hohfeld's obituary, "Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld", 28 Yale Law Journal 166 (1918) and Walter W. Cook, "Hohfeld's Contributions to the Science of Law", 28 Yale Law Journal 721 (1918).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hohfeld as professor of jurisprudence==
[[Jurisprudence]] is the branch of [[philosophy]] which deals with principles of law and the legal systems through which the law is applied. Hohfeld's contribution was to simplify; he created a very precise analysis which distinguished between fundamental legal concepts and then identified the framework of relationships between them. His work offers a sophisticated method for deconstructing broad legal principles into their component elements.  By showing how legal relationships are connected to each other, the resulting analysis illuminates policy implications and identifies the issues which arise in practical decision making.&lt;ref&gt;Luca Fiorito and Massimiliano Vatiero (2011), "Beyond Legal Relations: Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld's Influence on American Institutionalism". Journal of Economics Issues, 45 (1): 199-222.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hohfeldian analysis==
===Overview===
Hohfeld noticed that even respected jurists conflate various meanings of the term ''right'', sometimes switching senses of the word several times in a single sentence. He wrote that such imprecision of language indicated a concomitant imprecision of thought, and thus also of the resulting legal conclusions. In order to both facilitate reasoning and clarify rulings, he attempted to disambiguate the term ''rights'' by breaking it into eight distinct concepts. To eliminate ambiguity, he defined these terms relative to one another, grouping them into four pairs of Jural Opposites and four pairs of Jural Correlatives.

This use of the words ''right'' and ''privilege'' correspond respectively to the concepts of [[claim rights and liberty rights]].

Hohfeld argued that right and duty are correlative concepts, i.e. the one must always be matched by a claim about the other. If A has a right against B, this is equivalent to B having a duty to honor A's right. If B has no duty, that means that B has a privilege, i.e. B can do whatever he or she pleases because B has no duty to refrain from doing it. Each individual is located within a matrix of relationships with other individuals. By summing the rights held and duties owed across all these relationships, the analyst can identify both the degree of liberty — A would have perfect liberty if A has no duty to refrain from acting and others have a duty never to interfere with A's actions — and whether the concept of liberty is comprised by commonly followed practices, thereby establishing general moral principles and [[civil rights]].

===Examples of Hohfeldian analysis===
Hohfeld defines the correlatives in terms of the relationships between two individuals. In the theory of "[[in rem]] rights", there is a direct relationship between a person and a thing. Real rights are in this respect unlike claim rights or "rights in personam", which by nature must be exercised against a person, the best example being when someone is owed money by another. Hohfeld demonstrates that this way of understanding rights in general is wrong. In particular, Hohfeld demonstrates that there is no such thing as a legal relation between a person and a thing, since a legal relation always operates between two people. As the legal relations between any two people are complex, it is helpful to break them down into their simplest forms. Legal rights do not correspond to single Hohfeldian relations, but are compounds of them. A right can be defined as an aggregate of the Hohfeldian relations with other people.

Hohfeld replaces the concept of "right in personam" by "paucital right" and "right in rem" by a compound or aggregate of "multital rights". Rights held by a person against one or a few definite persons are paucital (or "in personam"), and rights held by a person against a large indefinite class of people are multital (or "in rem"). A contract right is paucital (or "in personam") because it can be enforced only against the specific parties to the contract. A property right is multital (or "in rem") because a landowner has the right to exclude not only specific people from his land but the "whole world". The landowner has many rights, privileges, powers, and immunities; his multital rights are composed of many paucital rights. For example, the owner has a right that others do not step on his land but there is not just one such right against a mass of persons (the community), but many separate although usually identical paucital rights with this content (as many instances as there are people in the community). This is what Hohfeld calls "multital" rights.

Consider also the definition of liberty. In Hohfeldian analysis, liberty is defined by an absence both of a duty and of a right. B is free because he has no duty to refrain from acting and because A has no right that he not act. That does not deny that B might decide to do what A wants because that is the essence of liberty. Nor does it deny the possibility that B might accept a duty to A to give a benefit to C. In that situation, C would have no right and would have to rely on A to enforce the duty. The truth is that liberty is significant from both a legal and a moral point of view because only liberty ensures that an individual has control over his or her choices on whether and how to act. If something interferes with this choice, the natural reaction is to resent it and to seek a remedy. The correlative between right and duty inevitably describes the way in which two people are limited in their choices to act, and the outside observer cannot capture the legal and moral implications without examining the nature of the right held by A. Hence, this relationship is qualitatively different. An interference with liberty would be considered wrongful without having to ask for detailed evidence. Yet whether A's relationship with B is morally suspect could only be determined by evaluating evidence on precisely what B's duty requires B to do or not to do.

'''Wex''' is a collaboratively built, freely available [[legal dictionary]] and encyclopedia.

Wex is an initiative to construct a collaboratively-created, public-access law dictionary and encyclopedia. It is sponsored and hosted by the [[Legal Information Institute]] ("LII") at the [[Cornell Law School]]. Much of the material that appears in Wex was originally developed for the LII's "Law about..." pages, to which Wex is the successor.

Wex accepts contributions from qualified experts. It screens editors before allowing them to contribute.
