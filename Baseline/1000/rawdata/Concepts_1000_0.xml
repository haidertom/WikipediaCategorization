'''Acceptability''' is the characteristic of a thing being subject to [[acceptance]] for some purpose. A thing is '''acceptable''' if it is sufficient to serve the purpose for which it is provided, even if it is far less usable for this purpose than the ideal example. A thing is '''unacceptable''' (or has the characteristic of '''unacceptability''') if it deviates so far from the ideal that it is no longer sufficient to serve the desired purpose, or if it goes against that purpose. From a logical perspective, a thing can be said to be acceptable if it has no characteristics that make it unacceptable:

{{quote|We say that a theory Δ is acceptable if for any [[Well-formed formula|wff]] α, Δ does not prove both α and ¬α.&lt;ref&gt;Dov M. Gabbay, Odinaldo T. Rodrigues, Alessandra Russo, ''Revision, Acceptability and Context: Theoretical and Algorithmic Aspects'' (2010), p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hungarian mathematician [[Imre Lakatos]] developed a concept of acceptability "taken as ''a measure of the approximation to the truth''".&lt;ref name="Stegmüller"&gt;W. Stegmüller, ''Collected Papers on Epistemology, Philosophy of Science and History of Philosophy, Volume 2'' (2012), p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; This concept was criticized in its applicability to philosophy as requiring that better theories first be eliminated.&lt;ref name="Stegmüller"/&gt; Acceptability is also a key premise of [[negotiation]], wherein opposing sides each begin from a point of seeking their ideal solution, and [[compromise]] until they reach a solution that both sides find acceptable:

{{quote|When a proposal or counter-proposal is received by an agent, it has to decide whether it is acceptable. If it is, the agent can agree to it; if not, and alternative that is acceptable to the receiving agent needs to be generated. Acceptability is determined by searching the hierarchy. If the proposal is a specification of at least one acceptable goal, the proposal is acceptable. If it is the specification of at least one unacceptable goal, the proposal is clearly unacceptable.&lt;ref name="Bouma"&gt;L. G. Bouma, H. Velthuijsen, ''Feature Interactions in Telecommunications Systems'' (1994), p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Where an unacceptable proposal has been made, "a counterproposal is generated if there are any acceptable ones that have had already been explored".&lt;ref name="Bouma"/&gt; Since the acceptability of proposition to a participant in a negotiation is only known to that participant, the participant may act as though a proposal that is actually acceptable to them is not, in order to obtain a more favorable proposal. 

==Acceptable risk==

One concept of acceptability that has been widely studied is [[acceptable risk]] in situations affecting human health. The idea of not increasing lifetime risk by more than one in a million has become commonplace in public health discourse and policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/iwachap10.pdf|title=Acceptable Risk|first1=Paul R.|last1=Hunter|first2=Lorna|last2=Fewtrell|publisher=''[[World Health Organization]]''|date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a heuristic measure. It provides a numerical basis for establishing a negligible increase in risk.

Environmental decision making allows some discretion for deeming individual risks potentially "acceptable" if less than one in ten thousand chance of increased lifetime risk.  Low risk criteria such as these provide some protection for a case where individuals may be exposed to multiple chemicals e.g. pollutants, food additives or other chemicals. In practice, a true zero-risk is possible only with the suppression of the risk-causing activity.

Stringent requirements of 1 in a million may not be technologically feasible or may be so prohibitively expensive as to render the risk-causing activity unsustainable, resulting in the optimal degree of intervention being a balance between risks vs. benefit. For example, emissions from hospital incinerators result in a certain number of deaths per year. However, this risk must be balanced against the alternatives.  There are public health risks, as well as economic costs, associated with all options. The risk associated with no [[incineration]] is potential spread of infectious diseases, or even no hospitals. Further investigation identifies options such as separating noninfectious from infectious wastes, or air pollution controls on a medical incinerator.

==Acceptable variance==

Acceptable variance is the range of variance in any direction from the ideal value that remains acceptable. In [[project management]], variance can be defined as "the difference between what is planned and what is actually achieved".&lt;ref&gt;Guy L. De Furia, ''Project Management Recipes for Success'' (2008), p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; Degrees of variance "can be classified into negative variance, zero variance, acceptable variance, and unacceptable variance".&lt;ref name="Desikan"&gt;Srinivasan Desikan, ''Software Testing: Principles and Practice'' (2006), p. 431.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[software testing]], for example, "[g]enerally 0-5% is considered as acceptable variance" from an ideal value.&lt;ref name="Desikan"/&gt;

[[Acceptance testing]] is a practice used in chemical and engineering fields, intended to check ahead of time whether or not a thing will be acceptable.

The '''AeroVironment Global Observer''' is a concept for a high-altitude, long endurance [[unmanned aerial vehicle]], designed by [[AeroVironment]] (AV) to operate as a stratospheric [[geosynchronous]] satellite system with regional coverage.&lt;ref name="did"&gt;[http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/aerovironments-global-observer-flying-high-again-03902/ Defense Industry Daily]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two Global Observer aircraft, each flying for up to a week at an altitude of {{convert|55000|to|65000|ft|m}}, could alternate coverage over any area on the earth, providing a platform for communications relays, remote sensing, or long-term surveillance. In addition to flying above weather and above other conventional aircraft, operation at this altitude permits communications and sensor payloads on the aircraft to service an area on the surface of the earth up to {{convert|600|mi|km}} in diameter, equivalent to more than {{convert|280000|sqmi|km2}} of coverage. Global Observer may offer greater flexibility than a satellite and longer duration than conventional manned and unmanned aircraft.&lt;ref name="did"/&gt;

==Development==

===JCTD program===
The Global Observer Joint Capabilities Technology Demonstration (JCTD) program had the goal of helping solve the capability gap in persistent ISR and communications relay for the [[US military]] and homeland security.  The Global Observer JCTD demonstrated a new stratospheric, extreme endurance UAS that could be transitioned for post-JCTD development, extended user evaluation, and fielding.  The program was a joint effort with the [[U.S. Department of Defense]], [[Department of Homeland Security]], and AeroVironment that started in September 2007, to culminate in a Joint Operational Utility Assessment (JOUA) in 2011.

The program provided for the system development, production of two aircraft, development flight testing, and JOUA with ISR and communications relay payload.  The flight testing and JOUA was conducted at the Air Force Flight Test Center at [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California. The primary objectives of the Global Observer JCTD Program were:

*Develop enabling technologies for a liquid hydrogen powered Global Observer UAS.
*Design, build, and demonstrate the Global Observer UAS for a 5 - 7 day endurance for {{convert|55000|to|65000|ft|m}} altitude missions with 380-pound, 2.8&amp;nbsp;kW payload capacity. The system had to be capable of being transported by a C-130 aircraft.
*Integrate and assess military utility of modular Global Observer payloads to address user identified gaps in ISR and communications relay.
*Evaluate system life cycle costs.

===JCTD sponsors===
*U.S. Department of Defense
*United States Special Operations Command
*United States Strategic Command
*U.S. Department of Homeland Security
*U.S. Air Force
*U.S. Army
*U.S. Coast Guard
*U.S. Defense Threat Reductions Agency

===Flight test partners===
*Air Force Flight Test Center
*NASA Dryden Flight Research Center

===Mission possibilities===
High-altitude, long endurance [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s, such as Global Observer, may enable several capabilities that enable rapid and effective actions or [[countermeasure]]s:
* '''Communications relay.'''  Durable, satellite-like, affordable communications relay with substantial bandwidth capacity can interconnect and route data in real time, enabling teams and command centers separated by topographical barriers to communicate with each other.
* '''Disaster response.''' Hurricane, storm tracking and general weather monitoring may be useful in evacuation planning, relief operations and first response coordination. Global Observer provides communication alternatives in the event of cell tower, microwave relay and satellite downlink failure.
* '''Maritime surveillance.''' Coastlines plagued by transport of illegal goods can be subject to long-term surveillance. Analysts can observe suspicious activity, determine patterns of behavior and identify threats.

==History==

A Global Observer prototype, called "Odyssey," flew in May 2005.  It had a {{convert|50|ft|m|abbr=on}}, one-third the size of the planned full-sized version, and ran solely on hydrogen fuel-cells powering electric motors that drove eight propellers, flying the aircraft for several hours.  The JCTD started in September 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popsci.com/military-aviation-space/article/2005-11/aerovironment-global-observer AEROVIRONMENT GLOBAL OBERSVER] - Popsci.com, 8 November 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gizmag10aug10"&gt;[http://www.gizmag.com/aerovironment-global-observer-long-endurance-uav-wing-load-tests/16022/ AeroVironment Global Observer long endurance UAS completes wing load tests] - Gizmag.com, 10 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2010, Aerovironment announced that the full-sized Global Observer wing had passed wing load testing.  The 53&amp;nbsp;m (175&amp;nbsp;ft) all-composite wing, which comes in five sections and is designed to maximize wing strength while minimizing weight, had loads applied to it that approximated the maximum loads it is designed to withstand during normal flight, turbulence and maneuvers.  In its third year of testing, the demonstrator had also undergone ground and taxi tests as well as taken a "short hop" lifting off the ground briefly during taxiing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/global-observer-clears-wing-load-testing-346040/ Global Observer clears wing load testing] - Flightglobal.com, 11 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gizmag10aug10"/&gt;

The Global Observer performed its first flight on 5 August 2010, taking off from Edwards AFB and reaching an altitude of {{convert|4,000|ft|m|abbr=on}} for one hour.  The flight was performed using battery power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gizmag.com/global-observer-first-flight/16049/ Global Observer successfully completes first flight] - Gizmag.com, 16 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;The aircraft completed initial flight testing, consisting of multiple low-altitude flights, at Edwards AFB in August and September 2010.  This phase used batteries to power the hybrid-electric aircraft and approximate full aircraft weight and center of gravity for flight control, performance, and responsiveness evaluation.  Following this, the program team installed and ground tested the aircraft's hydrogen-fueled generator and liquid hydrogen fuel tanks which will power it for up to a week in the [[stratosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/AeroVironment_Global_Observer_Stratospheric_Unmanned_Aircraft_System_Completes_Initial_Flight_Testing_999.html AeroVironment Global Observer Stratospheric UAV Completes Initial Testing] - Spacedaily.com, 26 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The first flight of the Global Observer using hydrogen fuel occurred on 11 January 2011, reaching an altitude of {{convert|5,000|ft|m|abbr=on}} for four hours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gizmag.com/global-observer-uav-first-hydrogen-powered-flight/17602/ Global Observer unmanned aircraft makes first hydrogen-powered flight] - Gizmag.com, 16 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 April 2011, Global Observer-1 (GO-1), the first aircraft to be completed, crashed 18 hours into its 9th test flight.  AeroVironment said it was undergoing flight test envelope expansion and had been operating for nearly twice the endurance and at a higher altitude than previous flights when the crash occurred.  At the time, the second aircraft developed as part of the JCTD program was nearing completion at a company facility; the $140 million program was originally scheduled for completion in late 2011, but the crash delayed this by a year.  AeroVironment was looking for sources of incremental funding to provide a bridge between the demonstration and a future procurement program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gizmag.com/global-observer-crash/18321/ Global Observer UAS crashes during flight-testing] - Gizmag.com, 4 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://aviationweek.com/awin/aerovironment-global-observer-crash-rattles-observers-0 AeroVironment Global Observer Crash Rattles Observers] - Aviationweek.com, 1 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Global Observer crashes during test flight |url=http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2011/04/04/Global-Observer-crashes-during-test-flight/UPI-41741301921265/ |accessdate=April 29, 2013 |agency=United Press International|date=April 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012, the Pentagon closed the development contract for the Global Observer, the reason being the crash in April 2011.  The Global Observer was used as a technology demonstration, not a program for a functioning aircraft.  In April 2013, the Pentagon stated that no service or defense agency had advocated for it to be a program.  AeroVironment is currently in possession of the second prototype Global Observer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2013/04/pentagon-global-observer/ No One Wants the Pentagon’s Gigantic Hydrogen-Powered Drone] Wired.com, April 30, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 February 2014, AeroVironment announced that it had teamed with [[Lockheed Martin]] to sell the Global Observer to international customers.  The partnership is focused around building "atmospheric satellite systems" around the UAV.  The Global Observer may compete for orders with the [[Boeing]] [[Phantom Eye]] liquid hydrogen-powered long endurance UAV.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/aerovironment-teams-with-lockheed-martin-on-global-observer-395675/ AeroVironment teams with Lockheed Martin on Global Observer] - Flightglobal.com, 7 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/2014-02-09/aerovironment-lockheed-martin-advance-global-observer-uas AeroVironment, Lockheed Martin Advance Global Observer UAS] - Ainonline.com, 9 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12611">{{Grammatical categories}}
In [[linguistics]] and [[grammar]], '''affirmation''' and '''negation''' ([[List of glossing abbreviations|abbreviated]] respectively '''{{sc|aff}}''' and '''{{sc|neg}}''') are the ways that grammar encode negative and positive polarity in [[verb phrase]]s, [[clause]]s, or other [[utterance]]s. Essentially an affirmative (positive) form is used to express the validity or [[truth]] of a basic assertion, while a negative form expresses its falsity. Examples are the [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s "Jane is here" and "Jane is not here"; the first is affirmative, while the second is negative.

The [[grammatical category]] associated and with affirmative and negative is called '''polarity'''. This means that a sentence, verb phrase, etc. may be said to have either affirmative or negative polarity (its polarity may be either affirmative or negative). Affirmative is typically the unmarked polarity, whereas a negative statement is marked in some way, whether by a negating word or particle such as [[English grammar|English]] ''not'', an [[affix]] such as [[Japanese language|Japanese]] -''nai'', or by other means, which reverses the meaning of the [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]]. The process of converting affirmative to negative is called '''negation''' – the grammatical rules for negation vary from language to language, and a given language may have more than one method of doing so.

Affirmative and negative responses (especially, though not exclusively, to [[question]]s) are often expressed using [[particle (grammar)|particle]]s or words such as [[yes and no|''yes'' and ''no'']], where ''yes'' is the affirmative and ''no'' the negative particle.

==Affirmative and negative responses==
{{main article|Yes and no}}
Special affirmative and negative words ([[particle (grammar)|particle]]s) are often found in responses to questions, and sometimes to other assertions by way of agreement or disagreement. In English, these are ''yes'' and ''no'' respectively, in French ''oui'', ''si'' and ''non'', in Swedish ''ja'', ''jo'' and ''nej'', and so on. Not all languages make such common use of particles of this type; in some (such as [[Welsh grammar|Welsh]]) it is more common to repeat the verb or another part of the predicate, with or without negation accordingly.

Complications sometimes arise in the case of responses to negative statements or questions; in some cases the response that confirms a negative statement is the negative particle (as in English: "You're not going out? No."), but in some languages this is reversed. Some languages have a distinct form to answer a negative question, such as French ''si'' and Swedish ''jo'' (these serve to contradict the negative statement suggested by the first speaker).

== Grammatical rules for negation ==

===Simple negation of verbs and clauses===
Languages have a variety of [[grammar|grammatical]] rules for converting affirmative [[verb phrase]]s or [[clause]]s into negative ones.

In many languages, an affirmative is made negative by the addition of a [[grammatical particle|particle]], meaning "not". This may be added before the [[verb phrase]], as with the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''no'':
* ''Está en casa.'' ("(S)he is at home", affirmative)
* '''''No''' está en casa.'' ("(S)he is not at home", negative)
Other examples of negating particles preceding the verb phrase include [[Italian language|Italian]] ''non'', [[Russian grammar|Russian]] не ''nye'' and [[Polish grammar|Polish]] ''nie'' (they can also be found in [[constructed language]]s: ''ne'' in [[Esperanto language|Esperanto]] and ''non'' in [[Interlingua grammar|Interlingua]]). In some other languages the negating particle follows the verb or verb phrase, as in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]:
*''Ik zie hem.'' ("I see him", affirmative)
*''Ik zie hem '''niet'''.'' ("I do not see him", negative)
Particles following the verb in this way include ''not'' in archaic and dialectal [[English language|English]] ("you remember not"), ''nicht'' in [[German language|German]] (''ich schlafe nicht'', "I am not sleeping"), and ''inte'' in [[Swedish Language|Swedish]] (''han hoppade inte'', "he did not jump").

In [[French language|French]], particles are added both before the verb phrase (''ne'') and after the verb (''pas''):
*''Je sais'' ("I know", affirmative)
*''Je '''ne''' sais '''pas''''' ("I don't know", negative).
However, in colloquial French the first particle is often omitted: ''Je sais pas''. Similar use of two negating particles can also be found in [[Afrikaans]]: ''Hy kan '''nie''' Afrikaans praat '''nie''''' ("He cannot speak Afrikaans").

In standard [[Modern English]], negation is achieved by adding ''not'' after an [[auxiliary verb]] (which here means one of a special grammatical class of verbs that also includes forms of the [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] ''be''; see [[English auxiliaries]]). If no such verb is present then the [[Auxiliary verb#Dummy|dummy auxiliary]] ''do'' (''does'', ''did'') is introduced – see [[do-support|''do''-support]].  For example:
*I have gone → I have '''not''' gone (''have'' is the auxiliary)
*He goes → He '''does not''' go (no auxiliary in the original sentence)
Different rules apply in [[subjunctive]], [[imperative mood|imperative]] and [[non-finite clause|non-finite]] clauses. For more details see {{slink|English grammar|Negation}}. (In [[Middle English]], the particle ''not'' could follow any verb, e.g. "I see not the horse.")

In some languages, like [[Welsh language|Welsh]], verbs have special inflections to be used in negative clauses. (In some language families, this may lead to reference to a negative [[grammatical mood|mood]].) An example is [[Japanese language|Japanese]], which conjugates verbs in the negative after adding the suffix ''-nai'' (indicating negation), e.g. ''taberu'' ("eat") and ''tabe'''nai''''' ("do not eat"). It could be argued that English has joined the ranks of these languages, since negation requires the use of an auxiliary verb and a distinct [[syntax]] in most cases; the form of the basic verb can change on negation, as in "he '''sings'''" vs. "he doesn't '''sing'''". [[Arnold Zwicky|Zwicky]] and [[Geoffrey Pullum|Pullum]] have shown that ''n't'' is an [[inflection]]al suffix, not a [[clitic]] or a derivational suffix.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Complex rules for negation also apply in [[Finnish language|Finnish]]; see {{slink|Finnish grammar|Negation of verbs}}. In some languages negation may also affect the dependents of the verb; for example in some [[Slavic languages]], such as [[Russian language|Russian]], the [[grammatical case|case]] of a [[direct object]] often changes from [[accusative]] to [[genitive]] when the verb is negated.

===Negation of other elements===
Negation can be applied not just to whole verb phrases, clauses or sentences, but also to specific elements (such as [[adjective]]s and [[noun phrase]]s) within sentences.&lt;ref&gt;The linguist D. Biber refers to two types of negation, synthetic ('no', 'neither' or 'nor' negation) and analytic ('not' negation). For example, "He is neither here nor there" (synthetic) or "He is not here" (analytic).&lt;/ref&gt; Ways in which this can be done again depend on the grammar of the language in question. English generally places ''not'' before the negated element, as in "I witnessed '''not a debate''', but a war." There are also negating affixes, such as the English [[prefix]]es ''non-'', ''un-'', ''in-'', etc. Such elements are called [[privative]]s.

===Multiple negation===
{{Main article|Double negative|Litotes}}
There also exist elements which carry a specialized negative meaning, including [[pronoun]]s such as ''nobody'', ''none'' and ''nothing'', [[determiners]] such as ''no'' (as in "no apples"), and adverbs such as ''never'', ''no longer'' and ''nowhere''.

Although such elements themselves have negative force, in some languages a clause in which they appear is additionally marked for ordinary negation. For example, in Russian, "I see nobody" is expressed as я никого́ не ви́жу ''ja nikovó nye vízhu'', literally "I nobody not see" – the ordinary negating particle не ''nye'' ("not") is used in addition to the negative pronoun никого́  ''nikovó'' ("nobody"). Italian behaves in a similar way: ''Non ti vede nessuno'', "nobody can see you", although ''Nessuno ti vede'' is also a possible clause with exactly the same meaning.

In  [[Russian language|Russian]], all of the elements ("not", "never", "nobody", "nowhere") would appear together in the sentence in their negative form. In Italian, a clause works much as in Russian, but ''non'' does not have to be there, and can be there only before the verb if it precedes all other negative elements: ''Tu non porti mai nessuno da nessuna parte''. "Nobody ever brings you anything here", however, could be translated ''Nessuno qui ti porta mai niente'' or ''Qui non ti porta mai niente nessuno''. In French, where simple negation is performed using ''ne ... pas'' (see above), specialized negatives appear in combination with the first particle (''ne''), but ''pas'' is omitted:
*''Je '''ne''' bois '''jamais''''' ("I '''never''' drink")
*''Je '''ne''' vois '''personne''''' ("I see '''nobody'''")
*''Je '''n'&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''ai '''jamais''' vu '''personne''''' ("I have '''never''' seen '''anybody'''") 
  
In [[Ancient Greek]], a simple negative (οὐ ''ou'' "not" or μή ''mḗ'' "not ([[Linguistic modality|modal]])") following another simple or compound negative (e.g. οὐδείς ''oudeís'' "nobody") results in an affirmation, whereas a compound negative following a simple or compound negative strengthens the negation:
* οὐδεὶς οὐκ ἔπασχέ τι ''oudeìs ouk épaskhé ti'', "nobody was not suffering something", i.e. "everybody was suffering"
* μὴ θορυβήσῃ μηδείς ''mḕ thorubḗsēi mēdeís'', "let (not) nobody raise an uproar", meaning "let nobody raise an uproar"

==Meaning of negation==
Simple grammatical negation of a clause in principle has the effect of converting a proposition to its [[negation|logical negation]] – replacing an assertion that something is the case by an assertion that it is not the case.

In some cases, however, particularly when a particular [[linguistic modality|modality]] is expressed, the semantic effect of negation may be somewhat different. For example, in English, the meaning of "you must not go" is not in fact the exact negation of that of "you must go" – this would be expressed as "you don't have to go" or "you needn't go". The negation "must not" has a stronger meaning (the effect is to apply the logical negation to the following infinitive rather than to the full clause with ''must''). For more details and other similar cases, see the relevant sections of [[English modal verbs]].

In some cases, by way of [[irony]], an affirmative statement may be intended to have the meaning of the corresponding negative, or vice versa. For examples see [[antiphrasis]] and [[sarcasm]].

For the use of double negations or similar as understatements ("not unappealing", "not bad", etc.) see [[litotes]].

'''Analogy''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ἀναλογία, ''analogia'', "proportion", from ''ana-'' "upon, according to" [also "against", "anew"] + ''logos'' "ratio" [also "word, speech, reckoning"]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da)nalogi%2Fa ἀναλογία],

In a narrower sense, analogy is an [[inference]] or an [[Logical argument|argument]] from one particular to another particular, as opposed to [[deductive reasoning|deduction]], [[inductive reasoning|induction]], and [[abductive reasoning|abduction]], in which at least one of the [[premise]]s, or the conclusion, is general rather than particular in nature. The term analogy can also refer to the relation between the source and the target themselves, which is often (though not always) a [[:wikt:similarity|similarity]], as in the [[analogy (biology)|biological notion of analogy]].
[[Image:Bohr atom model English.svg|thumb|200px|right|[[Ernest Rutherford|Rutherford's]] [[Rutherford model|model]] of the [[atom]] ([[Bohr model|modified]] by [[Niels Bohr]]) made an analogy between the atom and the [[Solar System|solar system]].]]

Analogy plays a significant role in [[problem solving]], as well as [[decision making]], [[argumentation]], [[perception]], [[generalization]], [[memory]], [[creativity]], [[invention]], prediction, [[emotion]], [[explanation]], [[conceptualization]] and [[communication]]. It lies behind basic tasks such as the identification of places, objects and people, for example, in [[face perception]] and [[facial recognition system]]s. It has been argued that analogy is "the core of cognition".&lt;ref&gt;[[Douglas Hofstadter|Hofstadter]] in Gentner et al. 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Specific analogical language comprises [[wikt:exemplar|exemplification]], [[Comparison (grammar)|comparisons]], [[metaphor]]s, [[simile]]s, [[allegory|allegories]], and [[parable]]s, but ''not'' [[metonymy]]. Phrases like ''and so on'', ''and the like'', ''as if'', and the very word ''[[like]]'' also rely on an analogical understanding by the receiver of a [[message]] including them. Analogy is important not only in [[ordinary language philosophy|ordinary language]] and [[common sense]] (where [[proverb]]s and [[idiom]]s give many examples of its application) but also in [[science]], [[philosophy]], [[law]] and the [[humanities]]. The concepts of [[association (psychology)|association]], comparison, [[correspondence (mathematics)|correspondence]], [[homology (mathematics)|mathematical]] and [[homology (biology)|morphological homology]], [[homomorphism]], [[iconicity]], [[isomorphism]], [[metaphor]], resemblance, and similarity are closely related to analogy. In [[cognitive linguistics]], the notion of [[conceptual metaphor]] may be equivalent to that of analogy. Analogy is also a basis for any comparative arguments as well as experiments whose results are transmitted to objects that have been not under examination (e.g., experiments on rats when results are applied to humans).

Analogy has been studied and discussed since [[classical antiquity]] by philosophers, scientists, theologists and [[law]]yers. The last few decades have shown a renewed interest in analogy, most notably in [[cognitive science]].

==Usage of the terms "source" and "target"==
With respect to the terms ''source'' and ''target'' there are two distinct traditions of usage:

* The logical and cultures and economics tradition speaks of an ''arrow'', ''[[homomorphism]]'', ''[[Map (mathematics)|mapping]]'', or ''[[morphism]]'' from what is typically the more complex ''domain'' or ''source'' to what is typically the less complex ''[[codomain]]'' or ''target'', using all of these words in the sense of mathematical [[category theory]].
* The tradition in [[cognitive psychology]], in [[literary theory]], and in specializations within [[philosophy]] outside of [[logic]], speaks of a [[Conceptual metaphor#Mappings|mapping]] from what is typically the more familiar area of experience, the ''source'', to what is typically the more problematic area of experience, the ''target''.

==Models and theories==

===Identity of relation===

In ancient [[Greek language|Greek]] the word ''αναλογια'' (''analogia'') originally meant [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportionality]], in the mathematical sense, and it was indeed sometimes translated to [[Latin]] as ''proportio''. From there analogy was understood as identity of relation between any two [[ordered pair]]s, whether of mathematical nature or not. [[Immanuel Kant|Kant's]] ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'' held to this notion. Kant argued that there can be exactly the same [[Logic of relatives|relation]] between two completely different objects. The same notion of analogy was used in the [[United States|US]]-based [[SAT]] tests, that included "analogy questions" in the form "A is to B as C is to ''what''?" For example, "Hand is to palm as foot is to ____?" These questions were usually given in the [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] format: HAND : PALM : : FOOT : ____ While most competent [[English language|English]] speakers will immediately give the right answer to the analogy question (''sole''), it is more difficult to identify and describe the exact relation that holds both between pairs such as ''hand'' and ''palm'', and between ''foot'' and ''sole''. This relation is not apparent in some [[lexical definition]]s of ''palm'' and ''sole'', where the former is defined as ''the inner surface of the hand'', and the latter as ''the underside of the foot''. Analogy and [[abstraction]] are different cognitive processes, and analogy is often an easier one. This analogy is not comparing ''all'' the properties between a hand and a foot, but rather comparing the ''relationship'' between a hand and its palm to a foot and its sole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v11n2/martin.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307062856/http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v11n2/martin.html |archivedate=2013-03-07 |df= }},
Michael A. Martin, ''The Use of Analogies and Heuristics in Teaching Introductory Statistical Methods''&lt;/ref&gt; While a hand and a foot have many dissimilarities, the analogy focuses on their similarity in having an inner surface. A computer algorithm has achieved human-level performance on multiple-choice analogy questions from the [[SAT]] test. The algorithm measures the similarity of relations between pairs of words (e.g., the similarity between the pairs HAND:PALM and FOOT:SOLE) by statistical analysis of a large collection of text. It answers SAT questions by selecting the choice with the highest relational similarity.&lt;ref&gt;Turney 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shared abstraction===

[[Image:Crepuscular rays8 - NOAA.jpg|thumb|300px|In several [[culture]]s,{{which|date=December 2012}} the [[Sun]] is the source of an analogy to [[God]].]]
Greek philosophers such as [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] actually used a wider notion of analogy. They saw analogy as a shared abstraction.&lt;ref name="Shelley"&gt;Shelley 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Analogous objects did not share necessarily a relation, but also an idea, a pattern, a regularity, an attribute, an effect or a philosophy. These authors also accepted that comparisons, metaphors and "images" (allegories) could be used as [[argument]]s, and sometimes they called them ''analogies''. Analogies should also make those abstractions easier to understand and give confidence to the ones using them.

The [[Middle Age]] saw an increased use and theorization of analogy. [[Rome|Roman]] lawyers had already used analogical reasoning and the Greek word ''analogia''. Medieval lawyers distinguished ''analogia legis'' and ''analogia iuris'' (see below). In [[Logic in Islamic philosophy|Islamic logic]], analogical reasoning was used for the process of qiyas in Islamic [[sharia]] law and [[fiqh]] jurisprudence. In [[Christianity|Christian]] [[theology]], analogical arguments were accepted in order to explain the attributes of [[God]]. [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]] made a distinction between ''equivocal'', ''univocal'' and ''analogical'' terms, the last being those like ''healthy'' that have different but related meanings. Not only a person can be "healthy", but also the food that is good for health (see the contemporary distinction between [[polysemy]] and [[homonymy]]). [[Thomas Cajetan]] wrote an influential treatise on analogy. In all of these cases, the wide Platonic and Aristotelian notion of analogy was preserved. [[James Francis Ross]] in ''Portraying Analogy'' (1982), the first substantive examination of the topic since Cajetan's ''De Nominum Analogia'', demonstrated that analogy is a systematic and universal feature of natural languages, with identifiable and law-like characteristics which explain how the meanings of words in a sentence are interdependent.

===Special case of induction===
On the contrary, [[Ibn Taymiyya]],&lt;ref name="Hallaq-94-5"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Logic of Legal Reasoning in Religious and Non-Religious Cultures: The Case of Islamic Law and the Common Law|last=Hallaq|first=Wael B.|journal=Cleveland State Law Review|volume=34|year=1985–1986|pages=79–96 [93–5]|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

;Premises
:''a'' is C, D, E, F, G
: ''b'' is C, D, E, F
;Conclusion
: ''b'' is probably G.

This view does not accept analogy as an autonomous mode of thought or inference, [[reduction (philosophy)|reducing]] it to induction. However, autonomous analogical arguments are still useful in science, philosophy and the humanities (see below), which makes this reduction philosophically uninteresting. Moreover, induction tries to achieve general conclusions, while analogy looks for particular ones.

===Shared structure===
[[Image:Latimeria chalumnae01.jpg|thumb|left|300px|According to Shelley (2003), the study of the [[coelacanth]] drew heavily on analogies from other fish.]]
Contemporary cognitive scientists use a wide notion of analogy, [[Extension (semantics)|extensionally]] close to that of Plato and Aristotle, but framed by Gentner's (1983) structure mapping theory.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Dedre Gentner]] et al. 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The same idea of [[Map (mathematics)|mapping]] between source and target is used by [[conceptual metaphor]] and [[conceptual blending]] theorists. Structure mapping theory concerns both [[psychology]] and [[computer science]]. According to this view, analogy depends on the [[Map (mathematics)|mapping]] or alignment of the elements of source and target. The mapping takes place not only between objects, but also between relations of objects and between relations of relations. The whole mapping yields the assignment of a predicate or a relation to the target. Structure mapping theory has been applied and has found considerable confirmation in [[psychology]]. It has had reasonable success in computer science and artificial intelligence (see below). Some studies extended the approach to specific subjects, such as [[metaphor]] and similarity.&lt;ref&gt;See Gentner et al. 2001 and [http://groups.psych.northwestern.edu/gentner/publications2.htm Gentner's publication page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100614055322/http://groups.psych.northwestern.edu/gentner/publications2.htm |date=2010-06-14 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Keith Holyoak]] and [[Paul Thagard]] (1997) developed their multiconstraint theory within structure mapping theory. They defend that the "[[coherence theory of truth|coherence]]" of an analogy depends on structural consistency, [[semantic similarity]] and purpose. Structural consistency is maximal when the analogy is an [[isomorphism]], although lower levels are admitted. Similarity demands that the mapping connects similar elements and relations of source and target, at any level of abstraction. It is maximal when there are identical relations and when connected elements have many identical attributes. An analogy achieves its purpose insofar as it helps solve the problem at hand. The multiconstraint theory faces some difficulties when there are multiple sources, but these can be overcome.&lt;ref name="Shelley"/&gt; Hummel and Holyoak (2005) recast the multiconstraint theory within a [[neural network]] architecture. A problem for the multiconstraint theory arises from its concept of similarity, which, in this respect, is not obviously different from analogy itself. Computer applications demand that there are some ''identical'' attributes or relations at some level of abstraction. The model was extended (Doumas, Hummel, and Sandhofer, 2008) to learn relations from unstructured examples (providing the only current account of how symbolic representations can be learned from examples).&lt;ref&gt;Doumas, Hummel, and Sandhofer, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mark Keane]] and Brayshaw (1988) developed their ''Incremental Analogy Machine'' (IAM) to include working memory constraints as well as structural, semantic and pragmatic constraints, so that a subset of the base analog is selected and mapping from base to target occurs in a serial manner.&lt;ref&gt;Keane, M.T. and Brayshaw, M. (1988). The Incremental Analogical Machine: a computational model of analogy. In [[Derek H. Sleeman|D. Sleeman]] (Ed). European working session on learning. (pp.53–62). London: Pitman.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Keane | first1 = M.T.

Eqaan Doug and his team&lt;ref&gt;See Chalmers et al. 1991&lt;/ref&gt; challenged the shared structure theory and mostly its applications in computer science. They argue that there is no line between [[perception]], including high-level perception, and analogical thought. In fact, analogy occurs not only after, but also before and at the same time as high-level perception. In high-level perception, humans make [[Knowledge representation|representations]] by selecting relevant information from low-level [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]]. Perception is necessary for analogy, but analogy is also necessary for high-level perception. Chalmers et al. conclude that analogy actually is high-level perception. Forbus et al. (1998) claim that this is only a metaphor.&lt;ref&gt;Forbus et al., 1998&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued (Morrison and Dietrich 1995) that Hofstadter's and Gentner's groups do not defend opposite views, but are instead dealing with different aspects of analogy.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison and Dietrich, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analogy and complexity===
Antoine Cornuéjols&lt;ref&gt;Cornuéjols, A. (1996). [http://www.lri.fr/~antoine/Papers/JFA96-final-osX.pdf Analogie, principe d’économie et complexité algorithmique] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604215148/http://www.lri.fr/~antoine/Papers/JFA96-final-osX.pdf |date=2012-06-04 }}. In ''Actes des 11èmes Journées Françaises de l’Apprentissage''. Sète.&lt;/ref&gt; has presented analogy as a ''principle of economy'' and ''computational complexity''.

Reasoning by analogy is a process of, from a given pair ''(x,f(x))'', extrapolating the function ''f''. In the standard modeling, analogical reasoning involves two "objects": the ''source'' and the ''target''. The target is supposed to be incomplete and in need for a complete description using the source. The target has an existing part ''S&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' and a missing part ''R&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''. We assume that we can isolate a situation of the source ''S&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'', which corresponds to a situation of target ''S&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'', and the result of the source ''R&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'', which correspond to the result of the target ''R&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''. With ''B&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'', the relation between ''S&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''R&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'', we want ''B&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'', the relation between ''S&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''R&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''.

'''''If the source and target are completely known:'''''

Using [[Kolmogorov complexity]] ''K(x)'', defined as the size of the smallest description of ''x'' and [[Solomonoff]]'s approach to [[inductive inference|induction]], Rissanen (89),&lt;ref&gt;Rissanen J. (1989) : ''Stochastical Complexity and Statistical Inquiry''. World Scientific
Publishing Company, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chris Wallace (computer scientist)|Wallace]] &amp; Boulton (68) proposed the principle of [[minimum description length]]. This principle leads to minimize the complexity ''K(target | Source)'' of producing the target from the source.

This is unattractive in Artificial Intelligence, as it requires a computation over abstract Turing machines. Suppose that ''M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''M&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' are local theories of the source and the target, available to the observer. The best analogy between a source case and a target case is the analogy that minimizes:

:''K(M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) + K(S&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;|M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) + K(B&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;|M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) + K(M&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;|M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) + K(S&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;|M&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;) + K(B&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;|M&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;)'' (1).

'''''If the target is completely unknown:'''''

All models and descriptions ''M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''M&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''B&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''S&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'', and ''S&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' leading to the minimization of:

:''K(M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) + K(S&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;|M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) + K(B&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;|M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) + K(M&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;|M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) + K(S&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;|M&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;)'' (2)

are also those who allow to obtain the relationship ''B&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'', and thus the most satisfactory ''R&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' for formula (1).

The analogical hypothesis, which solves an analogy between a source case and a target case, has two parts:
* Analogy, like induction, is a ''principle of economy''. The best analogy between two cases is the one which minimizes the amount of information necessary for the derivation of the source from the target (1). Its most fundamental measure is the computational complexity theory.
* When solving or completing a target case with a source case, the parameters which minimize (2) are postulated to minimize (1), and thus, produce the best response.

However, a ''cognitive agent'' may simply reduce the amount of information necessary for the interpretation of the source and the target, without taking into account the cost of data replication. So, it may prefer to the minimization of (2) the minimization of the following simplified formula:

:''K(M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) + K(B&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;|M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) + K(M&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;|M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;)

==Applications and types==

===In language===

====Language, literature and humour====

* Under the guise of metaphor, analogy enables people to transmit their thoughts and outlooks in an indirect or allusive manner.
* In literature and poetry analogy is used in order to make people laugh. The humoristic value of analogy can easily be noticed in cartoons and comic performances.
* Analogy helps humans in making linguistic generalizations and categorization.
* Analogy can be discerned in the creation and emergence of terms present in language (similarity that obtains between the persons, animals, things or events yields the need of understanding them together under one common notion).&lt;ref&gt;Maciej Koszowski (2017) Multiple Functions of Analogical Reasoning in Science and Everyday Life. Polish Sociological Review no. 1/2017, pp. 13-16.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Analogy may facilitate the using of particular terms and concepts as well as understanding  - upon the terms and phrases coined in language - the ways in which people comprehend the world and relate to each other.&lt;ref&gt;Maciej Koszowski (2017) Multiple Functions of Analogical Reasoning in Science and Everyday Life. Polish Sociological Review no. 1/2017, pp. 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Logic====
Logicians analyze how analogical reasoning is used in [[Argument from analogy|arguments from analogy]].

{{anchor|Analogy symbolism}}&lt;!--Redirect target--&gt;
An analogy can be stated using ''is to'' and ''as'' to represent the analogous relationship between two pairs of expressions, for example, "Smile is to mouth, as wink is to eye."  In the field of mathematics and logic, this can be formalized with [[Colon (punctuation)#Mathematics and logic|colon notation]] to represent the relationships, using single colon for ratio, and double colon for equality.&lt;ref name="REA-1994"&gt;{{cite book |author=Research and Education Association |editor1-last=Fogiel |editor1-first=M |title=Verbal Tutor for the SAT |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A17t-PP5xkgC&amp;pg=PA84 |accessdate=25 January 2018 |date=June 1994 |publisher=Research &amp; Education Assoc. |location=Piscataway, New Jersey |isbn=978-0-87891-963-5 |pages=84–86 |chapter=2. Analogies |oclc=32747316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of testing, the colon notation of ratios and equality is often borrowed, so that the example above might be rendered,  "Smile : mouth :: wink : eye" and pronounced the same way.&lt;ref name="REA-1994" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Schwartz-2007"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schwartz |first1=Linda |last2=Heidrich |first2=Stanley H.  |last3=Heidrich |first3=Delana S.  |title=Power Practice: Analogies and Idioms, eBook |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PaWURypwLcUC&amp;pg=PA4 |accessdate=25 January 2018 |date=1 January 2007 |publisher=Creative Teaching Press |location=Huntington Beach, Calif. |isbn=978-1-59198-953-0 |pages=4– |oclc=232131611}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rhetoric and argumentation====
* An analogy is a [[speech communication|spoken]] or [[Writing|textual]] comparison between two words (or sets of words) or situations to highlight some form of [[semantics|semantic]] or relational similarity between them. Such analogies can be used for purpose of persuasion, formation of attitudes and other forms of argumentation. They function more as ex post justification (or rationalization) of a decision one made before than as a means of inventing solutions for a given problem. Analogy may strengthen [[Politics|political]], theological and [[Philosophy|philosophical]] [[Logical argument|arguments]], even when the semantic (superficial) similarity is weak or non-existent, provided their being crafted carefully for the audience. Analogies are sometimes used to persuade those who cannot detect the flawed or non-existent arguments. The persuasive force of an analogy used for the sake of argumentation may stem not only from the mere similarity between the items (situations) compared, but also from the very emotions (both positive and negative) that are transferred from the things, persons or events chosen as a point of comparison.&lt;ref&gt;Maciej Koszowski (2017) Multiple Functions of Analogical Reasoning in Science and Everyday Life. Polish Sociological Review no. 1/2017, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Linguistics====&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Comparative method]] --&gt;
* An analogy can be the [[linguistics|linguistic]] process that reduces word forms perceived as irregular by remaking them in the shape of more common forms that are governed by rules. For example, the [[English language|English]] [[verb]] ''[[wiktionary:help|help]]'' once had the [[preterite]] ''holp'' and the past participle ''holpen''. These [[obsolete]] forms have been discarded and replaced by ''helped'' by the power of analogy (or by widened application of the [[productive (linguistics)|productive]] Verb-''ed'' rule.) This is called ''[[Morphological leveling|leveling]].'' However, irregular forms can sometimes be created by analogy; one example is the [[Comparison of American and British English#Verb morphology|American English]] past tense form of ''[[wiktionary:dive|dive]]'': ''dove'', formed on analogy with words such as ''drive'': ''drove''.
* [[Neologisms]] can also be formed by analogy with existing words. A good example is ''[[software]]'', formed by analogy with ''[[computer hardware|hardware]]''; other analogous neologisms such as ''[[firmware]]'' and ''[[vaporware]]'' have followed. Another example is the humorous&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/underwhelm|title=underwhelm - definition of underwhelm in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2017-04-07|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816122000/http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/underwhelm|archivedate=2016-08-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; term ''underwhelm'', formed by analogy with ''overwhelm''.
* Analogy is often presented as an alternative mechanism to [[generative linguistics|generative ''rules'']] for explaining [[productivity (linguistics)|productive]] formation of structures such as words. Others argue that in fact they are the same mechanism, that rules are analogies that have become entrenched as standard parts of the linguistic system, whereas clearer cases of analogy have simply not (yet) done so (e.g. Langacker 1987.445–447). This view has obvious resonances with the current views of analogy in cognitive science which are discussed above.

===In science===
* Analogies are above all used as a means of conceiving new ideas and hypotheses, which is called a heuristic function of analogical reasoning.
* Analogical arguments can play also probabative function, serving then as a means of proving the rightness of particular theses and theories. This application of analogical reasoning in science is, however, debatable. Probative value of analogy is of importance especially to those kinds of science in which logical or empirical proof is not possible such as theology, philosophy or cosmology in part where it relates to those areas of the cosmos (the universe) that are beyond any empirical observation and knowledge about them stems from the human insight and unsensory cognition.
* Analogy may be used in order to illustrate and teach (in order to enlighten pupils on the relations that happens between or inside certain things or phenomena, a teacher may refer to other things or phenomena that pupils are more familiar with).
* Analogy may help in creating or elucidating one theory (theoretical model) via the workings of another theory (theoretical model). Thus it can be used in theoretical and applied sciences in the form of models or simulations which can be considered as strong analogies. Other much weaker analogies assist in understanding and describing functional behaviours of similar systems. For instance, an analogy commonly used in electronics textbooks compares electrical circuits to hydraulics.&lt;ref&gt;Going with the flow: Using analogies to explain electric circuits. Mark D. Walker and David Garlovsky. School Science Review, 97, no. 361 (2016): 51-58.https://www.academia.edu/33380466/Going_with_the_flow_Using_analogies_to_explain_electric_circuits_Going_with_the_flow_Using_analogies_to_explain_electric_circuits&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the [[analog ear]] based on electrical, electronic or mechanical devices.
* Analogy can be helpful for the creation of notions and their systematization and classification, especially enabling scientists to make generalizations upon the discovery of an analogous structure or analogous internal laws present in different events or objects.&lt;ref&gt;Maciej Koszowski (2017) Multiple Functions of Analogical Reasoning in Science and Everyday Life. Polish Sociological Review no. 1/2017, pp. 4-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mathematics====
Some types of analogies can have a precise [[mathematical]] formulation through the concept of [[isomorphism]]. In detail, this means that given two mathematical structures of the same type, an analogy between them can be thought of as a [[bijection]] between them which preserves some or all of the relevant structure. For example, &lt;math&gt; \Bbb{R}^2 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \Bbb{C} &lt;/math&gt; are isomorphic as vector spaces, but the [[complex numbers]], &lt;math&gt; \Bbb{C} &lt;/math&gt;, have more structure than &lt;math&gt; \Bbb{R}^2 &lt;/math&gt; does: &lt;math&gt; \Bbb{C} &lt;/math&gt; is a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] as well as a [[vector space]].

[[Category theory]] takes the idea of mathematical analogy much further with the concept of [[functor]]s. Given two categories C and D, a functor ''f'' from C to D can be thought of as an analogy between C and D, because ''f'' has to map objects of C to objects of D and arrows of C to arrows of D in such a way that the compositional structure of the two categories is preserved. This is similar to the [[Analogy#Shared structure|structure mapping theory of analogy]] of Dedre Gentner, in that it formalizes the idea of analogy as a function which satisfies certain conditions.

Thus, the mind may use analogies between domains whose internal structures fit according with a [[natural transformation]] and reject those that do not.

See also [[case-based reasoning]].

====Anatomy====
{{See also|Analogy (biology)}}
In [[anatomy]], two anatomical structures are considered to be ''analogous'' when they serve similar [[role|functions]] but are not [[evolution]]arily related, such as the [[Leg (anatomy)|legs]] of [[vertebrate]]s and the legs of [[insect]]s. Analogous structures are the result of [[convergent evolution]] and should be contrasted with [[homology (biology)|homologous]] structures.

==== Engineering ====

Often a physical [[prototype]] is built to model and represent some other physical object. For example, [[wind tunnels]] are used to test scale models of wings and aircraft, which act as an analogy to full-size wings and aircraft.

For example, the [[MONIAC Computer|MONIAC]] (an [[analog computer]]) used the flow of water in its pipes as an analog to the flow of money in an economy.

==== Cybernetics ====

Where there is dependence and hence interaction between a pair or more of biological or physical participants communication occurs and the stresses produced describe internal models inside the participants. [[Gordon Pask|Pask]] in his [[Conversation Theory]] asserts there exists an [[Conversation Theory#Conversation|analogy]] exhibiting both similarities and differences between any pair of the participants' internal models or concepts.

===In normative matters===

====Morality====
Analogical reasoning plays a very important part in [[morality]]. This may be in part because morality is supposed to be impartial and fair. If it is wrong to do something in a situation A, and situation B is analogous to A in all relevant features, then it is also wrong to perform that action in situation B. [[Moral particularism]] accepts analogical moral reasoning, rejecting both deduction and induction, since only the former can do without moral principles.

====Law====&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Communist crime]] --&gt;
In [[law]], analogy is primarily used to resolve issues on which there is no previous authority. A distinction can be made between analogical reasoning employed in statutory law and analogical reasoning present in precedential law (case law).

=====Analogies in statutory law=====
In statutory law analogy is used in order to fill the so-called [[Non liquet|lacunas]] or gaps or loopholes.

First, a gap arises when a specific case or legal issue is not explicitly dealt with in written law. Then, one may try to identify a statutory provision which covers the cases that are similar to the case at hand and apply to this case this provision by analogy. Such a gap, in civil law countries, is referred to as a gap extra legem (outside of the law), while analogy which liquidates it is termed analogy extra legem (outside of the law). The very case at hand is named: an unprovided case.

Second, a gap comes into being when there is a statutory provision which applies to the case at hand but this provision leads in this case to an unwanted outcome. Then, upon analogy to another statutory provision that covers cases similar to the case at hand, this case is resolved upon this provision instead of the provision that applies to it directly. This gap is called a gap contra legem (against the law), while analogy which fills this gap is referred to as analogy contra legem (against the law).

Third, a gap occurs when there is a statutory provision which regulates the case at hand, but this provision is vague or equivocal. In such circumstances, to decide the case at hand, one may try to ascertain the meaning of this provision by recourse to statutory provisions which address cases that are similar to the case at hand or other cases that are regulated by vague/equivocal provision. A gap of this type is named gap intra legem (within the law) and analogy which deals with it is referred to as analogy intra legem (within the law).

The similarity upon which statutory analogy depends on may stem from the resemblance of raw facts of the cases being compared, the purpose (the so-called ratio legis which is generally the will of the legislature) of a statutory provision which is applied by analogy or some other sources.

Statutory analogy may be also based upon more than one statutory provision or even a spirit of law. In the latter case, it is called analogy iuris (from the law in general) as opposed to analogy legis (from a specific legal provision or provisions).

In statutory law analogy is also sometimes applied in order to liquidate the so-called conflicting or logical gap (i.e. the situation when two or more statutory provisions contradict each other) or the sui generis gap which stems from the lack of statutory regulation enabling the delivering of a decision whose passing is required by the law. Some other - less common as so-called ‘pertinent application of law’, ejusdem generis, typological notions  or presence of analogical pattern of reasoning in an a fortiori and comparative argument  - usages are also distinguished.&lt;ref&gt;See Maciej Koszowski, 	[http://www.aijcrnet.com/journals/Vol_7_No_1_March_2017/3.pdf The Scope of Application of Analogical Reasoning in Statutory Law]. American International Journal of Contemporary Research no. 1/2017 (v. 7): 16-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Analogies in precedential law (case law)=====
First, in precedential law (case law), analogies can be drawn from precedent cases (cases decided in past). The judge who decides the case at hand may find that the facts of this case are similar to the facts of one of precedential cases to an extent that the outcomes of these cases are justified to be the same or similar. Such use of analogy in precedential law pertains mainly to the so-called: cases of first impression, i.e. the cases which as yet have not been regulated by any binding judicial precedent (are not covered by a ratio decidendi of such a precedent).

Second, in precedential law, reasoning from (dis)analogy is amply employed, while a judge is distinguishing a precedent. That is, upon the discerned differences between the case at hand and the precedential case, a judge reject to decide the case upon the precedent whose ratio decidendi (precedential rule) embraces the case at hand.

Third, there is also much room for some other usages of analogy in the province of precedential law. One of them is resort to analogical reasoning, while resolving the conflict between two or more precedents which all apply to the case at hand despite dictating different legal outcome for that case. Analogy can also take part in ascertaining the contents of ratio decidendi, deciding upon obsolete precedents or quoting precedents form other jurisdictions. It is too visible in legal eductaion, notably in the US (the so-called 'case method').

An argument from analogy employed in precedential law is called case analogy as opposed to analogy employed in statutory law which is accordingly termed statutory analogy.&lt;ref&gt;See Maciej Koszowski, The Scope of Application of Analogical Reasoning in Precedential Law. Liverpool Law Review no. 1/2016 (v. 37): 9-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Analogies as a means of application of legal rules=====

In precedential law as well as in statutory law, analogy is also considered as a means of application of legal rules (statutory and precedential), serving thus as an alternative to legal deduction ([[legal syllogism]]). Then, there are compared instances to which a given rule applies with certainty with the facts of the case at hand. If the sufficient (relevant) similarity between them obtains, the rule is applied to the case at hand. Otherwise, the rule is deemed as inadequate for this case. Such analogy becomes a legal method.

Application of legal rules through analogy is more typical of the common law legal systems, especially when one deals with the so-called holdings (the denotation of a binding element of a judicial precedent in the US), being in civil law legal systems rather a proposition than an official mode of applying the law.

The instances from which analogy starts here off are called: base points, typical instances or paradigmatic cases.&lt;ref&gt;See Maciej Koszowski, Legal Analogy as an Alternative to the Deductive Mode of Legal Reasoning. The Indonesian Journal of International &amp; Comparative Law no. 1/2017: 73-87.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Restrictions on the use of analogy in law=====

In legal matters, sometimes the use of analogy is forbidden (by the very law or common agreement between judges and scholars). The most common instances concern criminal, administrative and tax law.

Analogy should not be resorted to in criminal matters whenever its outcome would be unfavorable to the accused or suspect. Such a ban finds its footing in the very principle: “''nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege''”, a principle which is understood in the way that there is no crime (punishment) unless it is expressly provided for in a statutory provision or an already existing judicial precedent.

Analogy should be applied with caution in the domain of tax law. Here, the principle: “''nullum tributum sine lege''” justifies a general ban on the employment of analogy that would lead to an increase in taxation or whose results would – for some other reason(s) – be to the detriment to the interests of taxpayers.

Extending by analogy those provisions of administrative law that restrict human rights and the rights of the citizens (particularly the category of the so-called “individual rights” or “basic rights”) is as a rule prohibited. Analogy generally should also not be resorted to in order to make  the citizen's burdens and obligations larger or more vexatious.

The other limitations on the use of analogy in law, among many others, pertain to:

* the analogical extension of statutory provisions that invlove exceptions to more general statutory regulation or provisions (this restriction flows from the well-known, especially in civil law continental legal systems, Latin maxims: “''exceptiones non sunt excendentae''”, “''exception est strictissimae interpretationis''” and “''singularia non sunt extendenda''”)
* the making of the use of an analogical argument with regard to those statutory provisions which comprise enumerations (lists)
* extending by analogy those statutory provisions that give impression that the Legislator intended to regulate some issues in an exclusive (exhaustive) manner (such a manner is especially implied when the wording of a given statutory provision involves such pointers as: “only”, “exclusively”, “solely”, “always”, “never”) or which have a plain precise meaning.

In civil (private) law, the use of analogy is as a rule permitted or even ordered by law. But also in this branch of law there are some restrictions confining the possible scope of the use of an analogical argument. Such is, for instance, the prohibition to use analogy in relation to provisions regarding time limits or a general ban on the recourse to analogical arguments which lead to extension of those statutory provisions which envisage some obligations or burdens or which order (mandate) something. The other examples concern the usage of analogy  in the field of property law, especially when one is going to create some new property rights by it or to extend these statutory provisions whose terms are unambiguous (unequivocal) and plain (clear), e.g.: be of or under cartian age.

The aforementioned bans on the use of analogy concern rather analogy which goes beyond the possible linguistic meaning of a statutory provision in question and do not pertain to analogy whose conclusions would remain within this meaning.&lt;ref&gt;See Maciej Koszowski, Restrictions on the Use of Analogy in Law. Liverpool Law Review no. 3/2016 (v. 37): 137-151.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Maciej Koszowski, The Scope of Application of Analogical Reasoning in Precedential Law. Liverpool Law Review no. 1/2016 (v. 37): 29-30&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Nomenclature=====

Analogy in law – apart from the terminological distinctions mentioned above – can be found also under such Latin names and phrases as:

* “argumentum a simile (a simili)”, i.e. an argument from similarity or an inference based upon similarity
* an argument or reasoning “a pari”
* “argumentum a similibus ad similia”
* “argumentum (inference) per analogiam”
* an argument "ab exemplo", i.e. an argument from paradigmatic examples.&lt;ref&gt;Maciej Koszowski, 	[http://www.aijcrnet.com/journals/Vol_7_No_1_March_2017/3.pdf The Scope of Application of Analogical Reasoning in Statutory Law]. American International Journal of Contemporary Research no. 1/2017 (v. 7): 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Uniqueness of legal analogy=====

Legal analogy is sometimes claimed to be of a different nature than analogy that occurs in empirical science and everyday life. It is due to several peculiar factors. First, there is the lack of possibility of verification of conclusions of legal analogy on empirical grounds, which entails the necessity of performance of a legal analogical argument both heuristic and probative function. Second, legal analogy, as the law itself, is by definition prescriptive, non-descriptive. Third, it has an obligatory character: a judge is in many circumstances obliged to reason by analogy (treat similar cases in a similar manner). Fourth, the use of analogy in law  rather does not hinge on complex underling doctrines or theories. Fifth, serious practical consequences flow from the use of analogy in law. Sixth, the points of comparison are easily recognizable in case of legal analogy. Seventh, analogy in law becomes a vehicle for extension of authority. Eighth, how to reason by analogy is a subject of legal training and education. Ninth, legal analogy has gained enormous amount of  attention and scrutiny amongst scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Maciej Koszowski, 	[http://journals.umcs.pl/sil/article/download/2830/pdf Why is analogy in empirical science and everyday life different from analogy in law?]. Studia Iuridica Lublinensia no. 2/ 2016: 127-143.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Structure of legal analogy=====

Legal analogy usually assumes the classical structure:

A case A possesses features X, Y, Z and has ascribed legal consequence G (the first premise).

An unregulated (unprovided) case B possesses features X, Y, Z (the second premise).

Therefore, the case B should be ascribed the legal consequence G (the analogical conclusion).

or:

There is a rule in force which addresses cases which features are A, B, C, D (the first premise).

There are unregulated (unprovided) cases which features are A, B, C and E or cases which features are A, B, C, D and E or cases which features are A, B, C and non-D (the second premise).

Therefore, there should be also a rule in force which addresses cases which features are A, B, C and E or A, B, C, D and E or  A, B, C and non-D that prescribes the same or similar legal consequece for these cases as the rule which addresses cases which features are A, B, C, D (the analogical conclusion).

Legal analogy can, however, assume also the structure of (mathematical) proportion, i.e.: A is to B as C is to D or A is to B as B is to C.&lt;ref&gt;Maciej Koszowski, [http://archiwum.ivr.org.pl/?ddownload=1482|Chaïm Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca’s Account of Analogy Applied to Law: the Proportional Model of Analogical Legal Reasoning], Archiwum Filozofii Prawa i Filozofii Społecznej no. 2/2016, pp. 8-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The contemporary proponents of proportional analogy, including legal one, are Chaïm Perelman and Lucie Olbrechts Tyteca.,&lt;ref&gt;Maciej Koszowski, [http://archiwum.ivr.org.pl/?ddownload=1482|Chaïm Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca’s Account of Analogy Applied to Law: the Proportional Model of Analogical Legal Reasoning], Archiwum Filozofii Prawa i Filozofii Społecznej no. 2/2016, pp. 6-10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chaim Perelman i Lucie Olbrechts-Tyteca, The New Rhetoric: A Treatise on Argumentation, Notre Dame 1969, for instance, p. 372.&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, in law, analogy of proportion takes the form:

1) Determination of the relation that obtains between the facts of the regulated (provided) case and its legal consequence.

2) Determination of the relation that obtains between the facts of the case at hand and their posited legal consequence (i.e. the consequence that is supposed to be potentially adequate for this case).

3) Having ascertained that the relations pointed out in points 1 and 2 are identical or similar to each other, attribution to the case at hand  the legal consequence which has been posited for that case.&lt;ref&gt;Maciej Koszowski, [http://archiwum.ivr.org.pl/?ddownload=1482|Chaïm Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca’s Account of Analogy Applied to Law: the Proportional Model of Analogical Legal Reasoning], Archiwum Filozofii Prawa i Filozofii Społecznej no. 2/2016, pp. 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In teaching strategies===
Analogies as defined in rhetoric are a comparison between words, but an analogy can be used in teaching as well. An analogy as used in teaching would be comparing a topic that students are already familiar with, with a new topic that is being introduced so that students can get a better understanding of the topic and relate back to previous knowledge. Shawn Glynn, a professor in the department of educational psychology and instructional technology at the University of Georgia,&lt;ref&gt;University of Georgia. Curriculum Vitae of Shawn M. Glynn. 2012. 16 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt; developed a theory on teaching with analogies and developed steps to explain the process of teaching with this method. The steps for teaching with analogies are as follows: Step one is introducing the new topic that is about to be taught and giving some general knowledge on the subject. Step two is reviewing the concept that the students already know to ensure they have the proper knowledge to assess the similarities between the two concepts. Step three is finding relevant features within the analogy of the two concepts. Step four is finding similarities between the two concepts so students are able to compare and contrast them in order to understand. Step five is indicating where the analogy breaks down between the two concepts. And finally, step six is drawing a conclusion about the analogy and comparison of the new material with the already learned material. Typically this method is used to learn topics in science.&lt;ref&gt;Glynn, Shawn M. Teaching with Analogies. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 Kerry Ruef, a teacher, began an entire program, which she titled [[The Private Eye Project]]. It is a method of teaching that revolves around using analogies in the classroom to better explain topics. She thought of the idea to use analogies as a part of curriculum because she was observing objects once and she said, "my mind was noting what else each object reminded me of..." This led her to teach with the question, "what does [the subject or topic] remind you of?" The idea of comparing subjects and concepts led to the development of The Private Eye Project as a method of teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Katie. Educational Leadership: Exploring the World with the Private Eye. September 1995. 16 October 2013 .&lt;/ref&gt; The program is designed to build critical thinking skills with analogies as one of the main themes revolving around it. While Glynn focuses on using analogies to teach science, The Private Eye Project can be used for any subject including writing, math, art, social studies, and invention. It is now used by thousands of schools around the country.&lt;ref&gt;The Private Eye Project. The Private Eye Project. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
There are also various pedagogic innovations now emerging that use visual analogies for cross-disciplinary teaching and research, for instance between science and the humanities.&lt;ref name=Petrucci&gt;{{Cite journal  | author = Mario Petrucci  | title = Crosstalk, Mutation, Chaos: bridge-building between the sciences and literary studies using Visual Analogy  | url = http://www.mariopetrucci.com/Visualizations.htm  | deadurl = no  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130925113131/http://mariopetrucci.com/Visualizations.htm  | archivedate = 2013-09-25  | df =   }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
====Catholic====
The Fourth Lateran Council of 1215 taught: ''For between creator and creature there can be noted no similarity so great that a greater dissimilarity cannot be seen between them.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.papalencyclicals.net/councils/ecum12-2.htm#2 Fourth Lateran Council of 1215]&lt;/ref&gt;

The theological exploration of this subject is called the ''analogia entis''. The consequence of this theory is that all true statements concerning God (excluding the concrete details of Jesus' earthly life) are analogical and approximations, without that implying any falsity.  Such analogical and true statements would include ''God is'', ''God is Love'', ''God is a consuming fire'', ''God is near to all who call him'', or God as Trinity, where ''being'', ''love'', ''fire'', ''distance'', ''number'' must be classed as analogies that allow human cognition of what is infinitely beyond positive or [[Via negativa|negative]] language.

The use of theological statements in syllogisms must take into account their essential analogical character, in that every analogy breaks down when stretched beyond its intended meaning.

===Everyday life===
* Analogy can be used in order to find solutions for the problematic situations (problems) that occur in everyday life. If something works with one thing, it may also work with another thing which is similar to the former.
* Analogy facilitates choices and predictions as well as opinions/assessments people are forced to do daily.
* Analogy is helpful in distribution of goods and privileges,  partition of burdens and dispension of treatment of other kind people deal with in everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;Maciej Koszowski (2017) Multiple Functions of Analogical Reasoning in Science and Everyday Life. Polish Sociological Review no. 1/2017, pp. 10-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hybrid analogies operating between disciplines===
Visual analogies have been developed that enable researchers to "investigate literary studies by means of attractive analogies taken principally from science and mathematics.  These analogies bring to literary discourse a stock of exciting visual ideas for teaching and research..." &lt;ref&gt;Visual Analogy/ Visualizations http://www.mariopetrucci.com/Visualizations.htm Retrieved: 08-05-2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Apollonian and Dionysian''' is a [[philosophical]] and literary [[concept]], or also a [[dichotomy]], based on [[Apollo]] and [[Dionysus]] in [[Greek mythology]].  Some [[Western culture|Western]] philosophical and literary figures have invoked this dichotomy in critical and creative works, most notably [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and later followers.  

In Greek mythology, Apollo and Dionysus are both [[son of God|sons]] of [[Zeus]]. Apollo is the god of the sun, of rational thinking and order, and appeals to logic, prudence and purity.  Dionysus is the god of wine and dance, of irrationality and chaos, and appeals to emotions and instincts. The [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] did not consider the two gods to be opposites or rivals, although often the two deities were entwined by nature.

==Nietzsche's version==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2017}}
Although the use of the concepts of the Apollonian and Dionysian is linked to [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]'s ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]'', the terms were used before him in [[German culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Del Caro, "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2709799 Dionysian Classicism, or Nietzsche's Appropriation of an Aesthetic Norm]", in ''[[Journal of the History of Ideas]]'', Vol. 50, No. 4 (Oct. - Dec., 1989), pp. 589–605 {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poet [[Friedrich Hölderlin|Hölderlin]] spoke of them, while [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann|Winckelmann]] talked of [[Dionysus|Bacchus]], the god of wine. After Nietzsche, others have continued to make use of the distinction. For example, [[Rudolf Steiner]] treated in depth the Apollonian and Dionysian and placed them in the general history and spiritual evolution of mankind.

[[File:Attic Black-Figure Lekythos with (Body) Dionysos between Maenads and Satyrs and (Shoulder) a Seated Man between Women and Men LACMA 50.9.43.jpg|thumb|230px|Attic Black-Figure Lekythos with (Body) Dionysos between Maenads and Sileni and (Shoulder) a Seated Man between Women and Men]]

Nietzsche's [[aesthetic]] usage of the concepts, which was later developed philosophically, first appeared in his book ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]'', which was published in 1872. His major premise here was that the fusion of Dionysian and Apollonian "''Kunsttriebe''" ("artistic impulses") form dramatic arts, or tragedies. He goes on to argue that this fusion has not been achieved since the ancient Greek tragedians. [[Nietzsche]] is adamant that the works of [[Aeschylus]] and [[Sophocles]] represent the apex of artistic creation, the true realization of tragedy; it is with [[Euripides]] that tragedy begins its downfall ("''Untergang''"). Nietzsche objects to Euripides's use of Socratic rationalism (the [[dialectic]]) in his tragedies, claiming that the infusion of [[ethics]] and [[reason]] robs tragedy of its foundation, namely the fragile balance of the Dionysian and Apollonian.

To further the split, Nietzsche diagnoses the [[Socratic method|Socratic Dialectic]] as being diseased in the manner that it deals with looking at life. The scholarly dialectic is directly opposed to the concept of the Dionysian because it only seeks to negate life; it uses reason to always deflect, but never to create. Socrates rejects the intrinsic value of the senses and life for "higher" ideals. Nietzsche claims in ''[[The Gay Science]]'' that when Socrates drinks the hemlock, he sees the hemlock as the cure for life, proclaiming that he has been sick a long time. (Section 340.) In contrast, the Dionysian existence constantly seeks to affirm life.  Whether in pain or pleasure, suffering or joy, the intoxicating revelry that Dionysus has for life itself overcomes the Socratic sickness and perpetuates the growth and flourishing of visceral life force—a great Dionysian 'Yes', to a Socratic 'No'. 
&lt;!-- As above, these two principles can only be described by provisional estimations and whatever Nietzsche states ought to mime that chord scrupulously, but these contrasts/notations might make it quite familiar to the reader wherewith their meaning can be adduced. Furthermore, something will have to be mentioned about the Greeks ''et cetera'' below in this section of the article; therefore, I have added a "section-stub" here. Consequently, other parts of this article will most likely require a slight alteration as well and additional evenhandedness, for this is a much debated topic. --&gt;

The interplay between the Apollonian and Dionysian is apparent, Nietzsche claimed in ''The Birth of Tragedy'', from their use in [[Greek tragedy]]: the tragic hero of the drama, the main protagonist, struggles to make order of his unjust fate, though he dies unfulfilled in the end. For the audience of such a drama, Nietzsche claimed, this tragedy allows them to sense an underlying essence, what he called the "Primordial Unity", which revives our Dionysian nature—which is almost indescribably pleasurable. However, he later dropped this concept saying it was "...burdened with all the errors of youth" (Attempt at Self-Criticism, §2), the overarching theme was a sort of metaphysical solace or connection with the heart of creation.

Different from [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s idea of the sublime, the Dionysian is all-inclusive rather than alienating to the viewer as a sublimating experience. The sublime needs critical distance, while the Dionysian demands a closeness of experience. According to Nietzsche, the critical distance, which separates man from his closest emotions, originates in Apollonian ideals, which in turn separate him from his essential connection with self. The Dionysian embraces the chaotic nature of such experience as all-important; not just on its own, but as it is intimately connected with the Apollonian. The Dionysian magnifies man, but only so far as he realizes that he is one and the same with all ordered human experience. The godlike unity of the Dionysian experience is of utmost importance in viewing the Dionysian as it is related to the Apollonian, because it emphasizes the harmony that can be found within one's chaotic experience.

==Other viewpoints==
===Post-modern reading===
Nietzsche's idea has been interpreted as an expression of ''fragmented consciousness'' or existential instability by a variety of modern and post-modern writers, especially [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Gilles Deleuze]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AeNOhsRjzrcC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;dq=Michel+Foucault+Apollonian+and+Dionysian&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=N5jHLWLXKP&amp;sig=tBkq0FoIuszQzCyAvLlF0aJUNcc&amp;hl=sr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dEJ4ULm3N8jxsga8jYCoBQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Michel%20Foucault%20Apollonian%20and%20Dionysian&amp;f=false|title=The Postmodernism Reader|first=Drolet |last=Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Postmodernism and the re-reading of modernity By Francis Barker, Peter Hulme, Margaret Iversen, Manchester University Press,1992, {{ISBN|978-0-7190-3745-0}} p. 258&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Peter Sloterdijk]], the Dionysian and the Apollonian form a dialectic; they are contrasting, but Nietzsche does not mean one to be valued more than the other.&lt;ref&gt;Thinker on Stage: Nietzsche's Materialism, translation by Jamie Owen Daniel; foreword by Jochen Schulte-Sasse, Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press, 1989. {{ISBN|0-8166-1765-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Truth being ''primordial pain'', our existential being is determined by the Dionysian/Apollonian dialectic.

Extending the use of the Apollonian and Dionysian onto an argument on interaction between the mind and physical environment, Abraham Akkerman has pointed to masculine and feminine features of city form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Femininity and Masculinity in City-Form: Philosophical Urbanism as a History of Consciousness|journal=Human Studies|first=Abraham|last=Akkerman|volume=29|issue=2|pages=229–256|doi= 10.1007/s10746-006-9019-4|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/9337128m117q48k2/|year= 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ruth Benedict===
Anthropologist [[Ruth Benedict]] used the terms to characterize cultures that value restraint and modesty (Apollonian) and ostentatiousness and excess (Dionysian). An example of an Apollonian culture in Benedict's analysis was the [[Zuñi people]] as opposed to the Dionysian [[Kwakiutl|Kwakiutl people]].&lt;ref&gt;BENEDICT, R. (1932), CONFIGURATIONS OF CULTURE IN NORTH AMERICA. American Anthropologist, 34: 1–27. doi: 10.1525/aa.1932.34.1.02a00020&lt;/ref&gt; The theme was developed by Benedict in her main work ''[[Patterns of Culture]]''.

[[Albert Szent-Györgyi]], who wrote that "a discovery must be, by definition, at variance with existing knowledge",&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Szent-Györgyi|first=Albert|date=1972-06-02|title=Dionysians and Apollonians|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/176/4038/966.1|journal=Science|language=en|volume=176|issue=4038|pages=966–966|doi=10.1126/science.176.4038.966|issn=0036-8075|pmid=17778411}}&lt;/ref&gt; divided scientists into two categories: the Apollonians and the Dionysians. He called scientific dissenters, who explored "the fringes of knowledge", Dionysians. He wrote, "In science the Apollonian tends to develop established lines to perfection, while the Dionysian rather relies on intuition and is more likely to open new, unexpected alleys for research...The future of mankind depends on the progress of science, and the progress of science depends on the support it can find. Support mostly takes the form of grants, and the present methods of distributing grants unduly favor the Apollonian."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Camille Paglia===
American humanities scholar [[Camille Paglia]] writes about the Apollonian and Dionysian in her 1990 bestseller ''[[Sexual Personae]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Paglia, Camille (1990). ''[[Sexual Personae|Sexual Personae: Art and Decadence from Nefertiti to Emily Dickinson]],'' New York: Vintage Books.{{isbn missing|date=September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The broad outline of her concept has roots in Nietzschean discourse, an admitted influence, although Paglia's ideas diverge significantly.

The Apollonian and Dionysian concepts comprise a dichotomy that serves as the basis of Paglia's theory of art and culture. For Paglia, the Apollonian is light and structured while the Dionysian is dark and [[chthonic]] (she prefers ''Chthonic'' to Dionysian throughout the book, arguing that the latter concept has become all but synonymous with [[hedonism]] and is inadequate for her purposes, declaring that "the Dionysian is no picnic."). The Chthonic is associated with females, wild/chaotic nature, and unconstrained sex/procreation. In contrast, the Apollonian is associated with males, clarity, celibacy and/or homosexuality, rationality/reason, and solidity, along with the goal of oriented progress: "Everything great in western civilization comes from struggle against our origins."&lt;ref&gt;Paglia (1990), p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

She argues that there is a biological basis to the Apollonian/Dionysian dichotomy, writing: "The quarrel between Apollo and Dionysus is the quarrel between the higher [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] and the older [[limbic]] and reptilian brains."&lt;ref&gt;Paglia (1990), p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Paglia attributes all the progress of human civilization to masculinity revolting against the Chthonic forces of nature, and turning instead to the Apollonian trait of ordered creation. The Dionysian is a force of chaos and destruction, which is the overpowering and alluring chaotic state of wild nature. Rejection of &amp;ndash; or combat with &amp;ndash; Chthonianism by socially constructed Apollonian virtues accounts for the historical dominance of men (including asexual and homosexual men; and childless and/or lesbian-leaning women) in science, literature, arts, technology and politics. As an example, Paglia states: "The male orientation of [[classical Athens]] was inseparable from its genius. Athens became great not despite but because of its misogyny."&lt;ref&gt;Paglia (1990), p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ontology]], the different kinds or ways of [[being]] are called '''categories of being'''; or simply '''categories'''. To investigate the categories of being is to determine the most fundamental and the broadest [[class (philosophy)|class]]es of entities.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} A distinction between such categories, in making the categories or applying them, is called an '''ontological distinction'''.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

==Early development==
The process of abstraction required to discover the number and names of the categories has been undertaken by many philosophers since [[Aristotle]] and involves the careful inspection of each concept to ensure that there is no higher category or categories under which that concept could be subsumed. The [[Scholasticism|scholars]] of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries developed Aristotle's ideas, firstly, for example by [[Gilbert de la Porrée|Gilbert of Poitiers]], dividing Aristotle's ten categories into two sets, primary and secondary, according to whether they inhere in the subject or not:
*Primary categories: Substance, Relation, Quantity and Quality
*Secondary categories: Place, Time, Situation, Condition, Action, Passion&lt;ref&gt;Reese W.L. ''Dictionary of Philosophy and Religion'' (Harvester Press, 1980)&lt;/ref&gt;
Secondly, following [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]’s likening of the classificatory hierarchy to a [[Porphyrian tree|tree]], they concluded that the major classes could be subdivided to form subclasses, for example, [[Substance theory|Substance]] could be divided into [[Genus]] and Species, and [[Quality (philosophy)|Quality]] could be subdivided into [[Property (philosophy)|Property]] and Accident, depending on whether the property was necessary or contingent.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''. cf Evangelou C. ''Aristotle’s Categories and Porphyry'' (E.J. Brill, Leiden, 1988)&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative line of development was taken by [[Plotinus]] in the second century who by a process of abstraction reduced Aristotle’s list of ten categories to five: Substance, Relation, Quantity, Motion and Quality.&lt;ref&gt;Plotinus ''Enneads'' (tr. Mackenna S. &amp; Page B.S., The Medici Society, London, 1930) VI.3.3&lt;/ref&gt; Plotinus further suggested that the latter three categories of his list, namely Quantity, Motion and Quality correspond to three different kinds of relation and that these three categories could therefore be subsumed under the category of Relation.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''. VI.3.21&lt;/ref&gt; This was to lead to the supposition that there were only two categories at the top of the hierarchical tree, namely Substance and Relation, and if relations only exist in the mind as many supposed, to the two highest categories, Mind and Matter, reflected most clearly in the dualism of [[René Descartes]].&lt;ref&gt;Descartes R. ''The Philosophical Works of Descartes'' (tr. Haldane E. &amp; Ross G., Dover, New York, 1911) Vol.1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern development==
An alternative conclusion however began to be formulated in the eighteenth century by [[Immanuel Kant]] who realised that we can say nothing about [[Substance theory|Substance]] except through the relation of the subject to other things.&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.3'' p.87&lt;/ref&gt; In the sentence "This is a house" the substantive subject "house" only gains meaning in relation to human use patterns or to other similar houses. The category of Substance disappears from [[Category (Kant)|Kant's tables]], and under the heading of Relation, Kant lists ''inter alia'' the three relationship types of Disjunction, Causality and Inherence.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'' pp.107,113&lt;/ref&gt; The three older concepts of Quantity, Motion and Quality, as [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce]] discovered, could be subsumed under these three broader headings in that [[Quantity]] relates to the subject through the relation of [[Logical disjunction|Disjunction]]; Motion relates to the subject through the relation of [[Causality]]; and [[Quality (philosophy)|Quality]] relates to the subject through the relation of [[Inherence]].&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.5'' pp.148-179&lt;/ref&gt; Sets of three continued to play an important part in the nineteenth century development of the categories, most notably in [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G.W.F. Hegel's]] extensive tabulation of categories,&lt;ref&gt;Stace W.T. ''The Philosophy of Hegel'' (Macmillan &amp; Co, London, 1924)&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Categories (Peirce)|C.S. Peirce's categories]] set out in his work on the logic of relations. One of Peirce's contributions was to call the three primary categories Firstness, Secondness and Thirdness&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.5'' pp.148-179&lt;/ref&gt; which both emphasises their general nature, and avoids the confusion of having the same name for both the category itself and for a concept within that category.

In a separate development, and building on the notion of primary and secondary categories introduced by the Scholastics, [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] introduced the idea that secondary or "derivative" categories could be derived from the primary categories through the combination of one primary category with another.&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.3'' p.116&lt;/ref&gt; This would result in the formation of three secondary categories: the first, "Community" was an example that Kant gave of such a derivative category; the second, "[[Linguistic modality|Modality]]", introduced by Kant, was a term which Hegel, in developing Kant's dialectical method, showed could also be seen as a derivative category;&lt;ref&gt;Hegel G.W.F. ''Logic'' (tr. Wallace W., Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1975) pp.124ff&lt;/ref&gt; and the third, "Spirit" or "Will" were terms that [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.15''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer A. ''On the Four-Fold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason''  1813 (tr. Payne E., La Salle, Illinois, 1974)&lt;/ref&gt; were developing separately for use in their own systems. [[Karl Jaspers]] in the twentieth century, in his development of existential categories, brought the three together, allowing for differences in terminology, as Substantiality, Communication and Will.&lt;ref&gt;Jaspers K. ''Philosophy'' 1932 (tr. Ashton E.B., University of Chicago Press, 1970) pp.117ff&lt;/ref&gt; This pattern of three primary and three secondary categories was used most notably in the nineteenth century by [[Peter Mark Roget]] to form the six headings of his [[Roget's Thesaurus|Thesaurus]] of English Words and Phrases. The headings used were the three objective categories of Abstract Relation, Space (including Motion) and Matter and the three subjective categories of Intellect, Feeling and Volition, and he found that under these six headings all the words of the English language, and hence any possible predicate, could be assembled.&lt;ref&gt;Roget P.M. ''Roget’s Thesaurus: The Everyman Edition'' 1952 (Pan Books, London, 1972)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Twentieth century development==
In the twentieth century the primacy of the division between the subjective and the objective, or between mind and matter, was disputed by, among others, [[Bertrand Russell]]&lt;ref&gt;Russell B. ''The Analysis of Mind'' (George Allen &amp; Unwin, London, 1921) pp.10,23&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Gilbert Ryle]].&lt;ref&gt;Ryle G. ''The Concept of Mind''  (Penguin, Harmondsworth, 1949) pp.17ff&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophy began to move away from the metaphysics of categorisation towards the linguistic problem of trying to differentiate between, and define, the words being used. [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]’s conclusion was that there were no clear definitions which we can give to words and categories but only a "halo" or "corona"&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein L. ''Philosophical Investigations'' 1953 (tr. Anscombe G., Blackwell, Oxford, 1978) pp.14,181&lt;/ref&gt; of related meanings radiating around each term. Gilbert Ryle thought the problem could be seen in terms of dealing with "a galaxy of ideas" rather than a single idea, and suggested that [[category mistake]]s are made when a concept (e.g. "university"), understood as falling under one category (e.g. abstract idea), is used as though it falls under another (e.g. physical object).&lt;ref&gt;Ryle G. ''Collected Papers'' (Hutchinson, London, 1971) Vol.II: ''Philosophical Arguments'' 1945, pp.201,202&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to the visual analogies being used, [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce]] and [[Clarence Irving Lewis|Lewis]],&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.1'' pp.52,82,106&lt;/ref&gt; just like [[Plotinus]] earlier,&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.9'' VI.5.5&lt;/ref&gt; likened the terms of propositions to points, and the relations between the terms to lines. Peirce, taking this further, talked of univalent, bivalent and trivalent relations linking predicates to their subject and it is just the number and types of relation linking subject and predicate that determine the category into which a predicate might fall.&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.5'' Vol I pp.159,176&lt;/ref&gt; Primary categories contain concepts where there is one dominant kind of relation to the subject. Secondary categories contain concepts where there are two dominant kinds of relation. Examples of the latter were given by [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] in his two propositions "the house is on the creek" where the two dominant relations are spatial location (Disjunction) and cultural association (Inherence), and "the house is eighteenth century" where the two relations are temporal location (Causality) and cultural quality (Inherence).&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.4'' pp.62,187&lt;/ref&gt; A third example may be inferred from Kant in the proposition "the house is impressive or [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]]" where the two relations are spatial or mathematical disposition (Disjunction) and dynamic or motive power (Causality).&lt;ref&gt;Kant I. ''Critique of Judgement'' 1790 (tr. Meredith J.C., Clarendon Press, Oxford 1952) p.94ff&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce]] and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]]&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.25'' pp.36,152&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the analogy of [[colour theory]] in order to illustrate the shades of meanings of words. Primary categories, like primary colours, are analytical representing the furthest we can go in terms of analysis and abstraction and include Quantity, Motion and Quality. Secondary categories, like secondary colours, are synthetic and include concepts such as Substance, Community and Spirit.

==Aristotle==
{{Main|Categories (Aristotle)}}
One of [[Aristotle]]’s early interests lay in the classification of the natural world, how for example the genus "animal" could be first divided into "two-footed animal" and then into "wingless, two-footed animal".&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle ''Metaphysics'' 1075a&lt;/ref&gt; He realised that the distinctions were being made according to the qualities the animal possesses, the quantity of its parts and the kind of motion that it exhibits. To fully complete the proposition "this animal is…" Aristotle stated in his work on the [[Categories (Aristotle)|Categories]] that there were ten kinds of predicate where...

"…each signifies either substance or quantity or quality or relation or where or when or being-in-a-position or having or acting or being acted upon".&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.2''&lt;/ref&gt;

He realised that predicates could be simple or complex. The simple kinds consist of a subject and a predicate linked together by the "categorical" or inherent type of relation. For Aristotle the more complex kinds were limited to propositions where the predicate is compounded of two of the above categories for example "this is a horse running". More complex kinds of proposition were only discovered after Aristotle by the Stoic, [[Chrysippus]],&lt;ref&gt;Long A. &amp; Sedley D. ''The Hellenistic Philosophers'' (Cambridge University Press, 1987) p.206&lt;/ref&gt; who developed the "hypothetical" and "disjunctive" types of [[syllogism]] and these were terms which were to be developed through the [[Scholasticism|Middle Ages]]&lt;ref&gt;Peter of Spain (''alias'' John XXI) ''Summulae Logicales''&lt;/ref&gt; and were to reappear in [[Category (Kant)|Kant's system of categories]].

''Category'' came into use with [[Aristotle]]'s essay ''[[Categories (Aristotle)|Categories]]'', in which he discussed univocal and [[equivocal]] terms, predication, and ten categories:&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2412/2412-h/2412-h.htm Categories]'', translated by [[Ella Mary Edghill|E. M. Edghill]]. For the Greek terms, see ''[http://meta.montclair.edu/ancient/greek/aristotle_greek/ The Complete Works of Aristotle in Greek]'' (requires DjVu), Book 1 (''Organon''), ''Categories'' Section 4 (DjVu file's page 6).{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2412/2412-h/2412-h.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-21 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102084057/http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2412/2412-h/2412-h.htm |archivedate=2013-11-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plotinus==
[[Plotinus]] in writing his ''[[Enneads]]'' around AD 250 recorded that "philosophy at a very early age investigated the number and character of the existents… some found ten, others less…. to some the genera were the first principles, to others only a generic classification of existents".&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.9'' VI.1.1&lt;/ref&gt; He realised that some categories were reducible to others saying "why are not Beauty, Goodness and the virtues, Knowledge and Intelligence included among the primary genera?"&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'' VI.2.17&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded that such [[Transcendentals|transcendental categories]] and even the [[Categories (Aristotle)|categories of Aristotle]] were in some way posterior to the three [[Eleatics|Eleatic]] categories first recorded in Plato's dialogue ''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]]'' and which comprised the following three coupled terms: 
*Unity/Plurality
*Motion/Stability
*Identity/Difference&lt;ref&gt;Plato ''Parmenides'' (tr. Jowett B., ''The Dialogues of Plato'', Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1875) p.162&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plotinus]] called these "the hearth of reality"&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.9'' Op.cit.1.4&lt;/ref&gt; deriving from them not only the three categories of Quantity, Motion and Quality but also what came to be known as "the three moments of the [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic world process]]":
*First, there existed the "One", and his view that "the origin of things is a contemplation"
*The Second "is certainly an activity… a secondary phase… life streaming from life… energy running through the universe"
*The Third is some kind of Intelligence concerning which he wrote "Activity is prior to Intellection… and self knowledge"&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'' III.8.5&lt;/ref&gt;

Plotinus likened the three to the centre, the radii and the circumference of a circle, and clearly thought that the principles underlying the categories were the first principles of creation. "From a single root all being multiplies". Similar ideas were to be introduced into Early Christian thought by, for example, [[Gregory of Nazianzus]] who summed it up saying "Therefore Unity, having from all eternity arrived by motion at duality, came to rest in [[trinity]]".&lt;ref&gt;Rawlinson A.E. (ed.) ''Essays on the Trinity and the Incarnation'' (Longmans, London, 1928) pp.241-244&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kant==

In the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' (1781), [[Immanuel Kant]] argued that the [[Category (Kant)|categories]] are part of our own mental structure and consist of a set of ''a priori'' concepts through which we interpret the world around us.&lt;ref&gt;	''Op.cit.3'' p.87&lt;/ref&gt; These concepts correspond to twelve logical functions of the understanding which we use to make judgements and there are therefore two tables given in the ''Critique'', one of the Judgements and a corresponding one for the [[Category (Kant)|Categories]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'' pp.107,113&lt;/ref&gt; To give an example, the logical function behind our reasoning from ground to consequence (based on the [[Hypothetical syllogism|Hypothetical relation]]) underlies our understanding of the world in terms of cause and effect (the [[Causality|Causal relation]]). In each table the number twelve arises from, firstly, an initial division into two: the Mathematical and the Dynamical; a second division of each of these headings into a further two: Quantity and Quality, and Relation and Modality respectively; and, thirdly, each of these then divides into a further three subheadings as follows.

[[Critique of the Kantian philosophy|Criticism of Kant's system]] followed, firstly, by [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], who amongst other things was unhappy with the term "Community", and declared that the tables "do open violence to truth, treating it as nature was treated by old-fashioned gardeners",&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer A. ''The World as Will and Representation'' (tr. Payne A., Dover Publications, London, New York, 1966) p.430&lt;/ref&gt; and secondly, by [[Walter Terence Stace|W.T.Stace]] who in his book ''The Philosophy of Hegel'' suggested that in order to make Kant's structure completely symmetrical a third category would need to be added to the Mathematical and the Dynamical.&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.15'' p.222&lt;/ref&gt; This, he said, Hegel was to do with his category of Notion.

==Hegel==
[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G.W.F. Hegel]] in his ''[[Science of Logic]]'' (1812) attempted to provide a more comprehensive system of categories than Kant and developed a structure that was almost entirely triadic.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt; So important were the categories to Hegel that he claimed "the first principle of the world, the Absolute, is a system of categories… the categories must be the reason of which the world is a consequent".&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'' pp.63,65&lt;/ref&gt;

Using his own logical method of combination, later to be called the [[Dialectic|Hegelian dialectic]], of arguing from thesis through antithesis to synthesis, he arrived, as shown in W.T.Stace's work cited, at a hierarchy of some 270 categories. The three very highest categories were Logic, Nature and Spirit. The three highest categories of Logic, however, he called Being, Essence and Notion which he explained as follows:
*[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Being]] was differentiated from Nothing by containing with it the concept of the "Other", an initial internal division that can be compared with Kant's category of Disjunction. Stace called the category of Being the sphere of common sense containing concepts such as consciousness, sensation, quantity, quality and measure.
*[[Essence]]. The "Other" separates itself from the "One" by a kind of motion, reflected in Hegel's first synthesis of "[[Becoming (philosophy)|Becoming]]". For Stace this category represented the sphere of science containing within it firstly, the thing, its form and properties; secondly, cause, effect and reciprocity, and thirdly, the principles of classification, identity and difference. 
*[[Notion (philosophy)|Notion]]. Having passed over into the "Other" there is an almost [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic return]] into a higher unity that in embracing the "One" and the "Other" enables them to be considered together through their inherent qualities. This according to [[Walter Terence Stace|Stace]] is the sphere of philosophy proper where we find not only the three types of logical proposition: Disjunctive, Hypothetical and Categorical but also the three transcendental concepts of [[Transcendentals|Beauty, Goodness and Truth]].&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.18'' pp.124ff&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer's]] category that corresponded with Notion was that of Idea, which in his "''Four-Fold Root of Sufficient Reason''" he complemented with the category of the Will.&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.20''&lt;/ref&gt; The title of his major work was "[[The World as Will and Representation|The World as Will and Idea]]". The two other complementary categories, reflecting one of Hegel's initial divisions, were those of Being and Becoming. At around the same time, [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] was developing his colour theories in the ''[[Theory of Colours|Farbenlehre]]'' of 1810, and introduced similar principles of combination and complementation, symbolising, for Goethe, "the primordial relations which belong both to nature and vision".&lt;ref&gt;Goethe J.W. von, ''The Theory of Colours'' (tr. Eastlake C.L., MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1970) p.350&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] in his ''[[Science of Logic]]'' accordingly asks us to see his system not as a tree but as a circle.

==Peirce==

[[Charles Sanders Peirce]], who had read Kant and Hegel closely, and who also had some knowledge of Aristotle, proposed a system of merely three phenomenological categories: [[Categories (Peirce)|Firstness, Secondness, and Thirdness]], which he repeatedly invoked in his subsequent writings. Like Hegel, C.S.Peirce attempted to develop a system of categories from a single indisputable principle, in Peirce's case the notion that in the first instance he could only be aware of his own ideas. 
	"It seems that the true categories of consciousness are first, feeling… second, a sense of resistance… and third, synthetic consciousness, or thought".&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.5'' p.200, cf Locke&lt;/ref&gt;
	Elsewhere he called the three primary categories: [[Quality (philosophy)|Quality]], Reaction and [[Meaning (semiotics)|Meaning]], and even [[Categories (Peirce)|Firstness, Secondness and Thirdness]], saying, "perhaps it is not right to call these categories conceptions, they are so intangible that they are rather tones or tints upon conceptions":&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'' p.179&lt;/ref&gt;     
*Firstness ([[Quality (philosophy)|Quality]]): "The first is predominant in feeling… we must think of a quality without parts, e.g. the colour of magenta… When I say it is a quality I do not mean that it "inheres" in a subject… The whole content of consciousness is made up of qualities of feeling, as truly as the whole of space is made up of points, or the whole of time by instants".
*Secondness (Reaction): "This is present even in such a rudimentary fragment of experience as a simple feeling… an action and reaction between our soul and the stimulus… The idea of second is predominant in the ideas of causation and of statical force… the real is active; we acknowledge it by calling it the actual".
*Thirdness ([[Meaning (semiotics)|Meaning]]): "Thirdness is essentially of a general nature… ideas in which thirdness predominate [include] the idea of a sign or representation… Every genuine triadic relation involves meaning… the idea of meaning is irreducible to those of quality and reaction… synthetical consciousness is the consciousness of a third or medium".&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'' pp.148-179&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Peirce's three categories correspond to the three concepts of relation given in Kant's tables, the sequence is now reversed and follows that given by [[Science of Logic|Hegel]], and indeed before Hegel of the three moments of the world-process given by [[Neoplatonism|Plotinus]]. Later, Peirce gave a mathematical reason for there being three categories in that although monadic, dyadic and triadic nodes are irreducible, every node of a higher valency is reducible to a "compound of triadic relations".&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'' p.176&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], who was developing "semiology" in France just as Peirce was developing "semiotics" in the US, likened each term of a proposition to "the centre of a constellation, the point where other coordinate terms, the sum of which is indefinite, converge".&lt;ref&gt;Saussure F. de,''Course in General Linguistics'' 1916 (tr. Harris R., Duckworth, London, 1983) p.124&lt;/ref&gt;

==Others==
[[Edmund Husserl]] (1962, 2000) wrote extensively about categorial systems as part of his [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].

For [[Gilbert Ryle]] (1949), a category (in particular a "[[category mistake]]") is an important semantic concept, but one having only loose affinities to an ontological category.

Contemporary systems of categories have been proposed by [[John G. Bennett]] (The Dramatic Universe, 4 vols., 1956–65), [[Wilfrid Sellars]] (1974), [[Reinhardt Grossmann]] (1983, 1992), Johansson (1989), Hoffman and Rosenkrantz (1994), [[Roderick Chisholm]] (1996), [[Barry Smith (ontologist)]] (2003), and [[Jonathan Lowe]] (2006).

==Statement==
The principle states that a [[Turing completeness|universal]] [[computer|computing device]] can [[simulation|simulate]] every [[physical process]].

==History==
The principle was stated by Deutsch in 1985 with respect to [[finitary]] machines and processes.&lt;!-- so who (re)interpreted it in the form stated here? --&gt; He observed that [[classical physics]], which makes use of the concept of [[real number]]s, cannot be simulated by a [[Turing machine]], which can only represent [[computable real]]s. Deutsch proposed that [[quantum computer]]s may actually obey the CTD principle, assuming that the laws of [[quantum physics]] can completely describe every physical process.

An earlier version of this thesis for classical computers was stated by Alan Turing's friend and student [[Robin Gandy]] in 1980&lt;ref&gt;Gandy, R. (1980).

[[File:Kepler-Bruno.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Figure 'M' (for Latin ''Mundus'') from [[Johannes Kepler]]'s 1617–1621 ''[[Epitome Astronomiae Copernicanae]]'', showing the [[Earth]] as belonging to just one of any number of similar stars.]]
In [[physical cosmology]], the '''Copernican principle''' is an alternative name for the  [[principle of relativity]], stating that humans, on the [[Earth]] or in the [[Solar system]], are not privileged observers of the [[universe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Peacock |first=John A. | title =  Cosmological Physics | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | page = 66 | year = 1998 |isbn= 0-521-42270-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Named for [[Copernican heliocentrism]], it is a working assumption that arises from a modified cosmological extension of [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus's]] argument of a moving Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bondi |first=Hermann| authorlink = Hermann Bondi | title = Cosmology | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1952 | pages = 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some sense, it is equivalent to the [[mediocrity principle]].

== Origin and implications ==

[[Hermann Bondi]] named the principle after Copernicus in the mid-20th century, although the principle itself dates back to the 16th-17th century [[paradigm shift]] away from the [[Ptolemaic system]], which placed [[Earth]] at the center of the [[universe]]. Copernicus proposed that the motion of the planets can be explained by reference to an assumption that the Sun and not Earth is centrally located and stationary. He argued that the [[apparent retrograde motion]] of the planets is an illusion caused by Earth's movement around the [[Sun]], which the [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican model]] placed at the centre of the universe. Copernicus himself was mainly motivated by technical dissatisfaction with the earlier system and not by support for any mediocrity principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuhn |first= Thomas S. | authorlink = Thomas Kuhn | title = The Copernican Revolution: Planetary Astronomy in the Development of Western Thought | publisher = [[Harvard University Press]] |year=1957 | isbn=978-0-674-17103-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, although the Copernican heliocentric model is often described as "demoting" Earth from its central role it had in the Ptolemaic geocentric model, it was successors to Copernicus, notably the 16th century [[Giordano Bruno]] who adopted this new perspective. The earth's central position had been interpreted as being in the "lowest and filthiest parts". Instead, as Galileo said, the earth is part of the "dance of the stars" rather than the "sump where the universe's filth and ephemera collect".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1038/scientificamerican0301-24a |journal= Scientific American |year=2001 |volume=284 |issue=3 |pages=24 |title= Copernican Counterrevolution |authorlink= George Musser |last=Musser |first=George  |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=in-brief-2001-03|bibcode = 2001SciAm.284c..24M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1511/2009.76.50 |journal= American Scientist |year=2009 |volume=97 |issue=1 |pages=50–57 |title= The Bones of Copernicus |first= Dennis |last=Danielson }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late 20th Century, Carl Sagan asked, "Who are we? We find that we live on an insignificant planet of a humdrum star lost in a galaxy tucked away in some forgotten corner of a universe in which there are far more galaxies than people."&lt;ref&gt;Sagan C, Cosmos (1980) p.193&lt;/ref&gt;

In cosmology, if one assumes the Copernican principle and observes that the universe appears [[Isotropy|isotropic]] or the same in all directions from our vantage point on Earth, then one can infer that the universe is generally [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneous]] or the same everywhere (at any given time) and is also isotropic about any given point. These two conditions make up the [[cosmological principle]].&lt;ref name="RowanRobinson1996" /&gt; In practice, astronomers observe that the universe has [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|heterogeneous]] or non-uniform structures up to the scale of [[galactic supercluster]]s, [[Galaxy filament|filaments]] and [[Void (astronomy)|great void]]s. It becomes more and more homogeneous and isotropic when observed on larger and larger scales, with little detectable structure on scales of more than about 200 million [[parsec]]s. However, on scales comparable to the radius of the observable universe, we see systematic changes with distance from Earth. For instance, galaxies contain more young stars and are less clustered, and [[quasars]] appear more numerous. While this might suggest that Earth is at the center of the universe, the Copernican principle requires us to interpret it as evidence for the evolution of the universe with time: this distant light has taken most of the age of the universe to reach us and show us the universe when it was young. The most distant light of all, [[cosmic microwave background radiation]], is isotropic to at least one part in a thousand.

Modern mathematical cosmology is based on the assumption that the Cosmological principle is almost, but not exactly, true on the largest scales. The Copernican principle represents the irreducible philosophical assumption needed to justify this, when combined with the observations.

[[Michael Rowan-Robinson]] emphasizes the Copernican principle as the threshold test for modern thought, asserting that: "It is evident that in the post-Copernican era of human history, no well-informed and rational person can imagine that the Earth occupies a unique position in the universe."&lt;ref name="RowanRobinson1996"&gt;{{cite book | last=Rowan-Robinson |first=Michael  |authorlink=Michael Rowan-Robinson | title = Cosmology| edition = 3rd | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | pages = 62–63  |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-19-851884-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bondi and [[Thomas Gold]] used the Copernican principle to argue for the [[perfect cosmological principle]] which maintains that the universe is also homogeneous in time, and is the basis for the [[steady-state cosmology]].&lt;ref name="BondiGold1948"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bondi|first=H.|author2=Gold, T.|title=The Steady-State Theory of the Expanding Universe|journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]|year=1948|volume=108|issue=3|pages=252–270|bibcode=1948MNRAS.108..252B|doi=10.1093/mnras/108.3.252}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this strongly conflicts with the evidence for cosmological evolution mentioned earlier:  the universe has progressed from extremely different conditions at the [[Big Bang]], and will continue to progress toward extremely different conditions, particularly under the rising influence of [[dark energy]], apparently toward the [[Big Freeze]] or [[Big Rip]].

Since the 1990s the term has been used (interchangeably with "the Copernicus method") for [[J. Richard Gott]]'s [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian-inference]]-based prediction of duration of ongoing events, a generalized version of the [[Doomsday argument]].{{clarify|date=April 2017}}

==Tests of the principle==
The Copernican principle has never been proven, and in the most general sense cannot be proven, but it is implicit in many modern theories of physics.  Cosmological models are often derived with reference to the [[Cosmological principle]], slightly more general than the Copernican principle, and many tests of these models can be considered tests of the Copernican principle.&lt;ref name=clarkson&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Clarkson | first1 = C. | last2 = Bassett | first2 = B. | last3 = Lu | first3 = T. | title = A General Test of the Copernican Principle | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.101.011301 | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 101 | year = 2008 | pmid =  | pmc = |arxiv = 0712.3457 |bibcode = 2008PhRvL.101a1301C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical===
Before the term Copernican principle was even coined, Earth was repeatedly shown not to have any special location in the universe. The [[Copernican Revolution]] dethroned Earth to just one of many planets orbiting the Sun. [[Proper motion]] was mentioned by Halley. [[William Herschel]] found that the Solar System is moving through space within our disk-shaped [[Milky Way]] galaxy. [[Edwin Hubble]] showed that our galaxy is just one of many galaxies in the universe. Examination of our galaxy's position and motion in the universe led to the [[Big Bang|Big Bang theory]] and the whole of modern [[cosmology]].

===Modern tests===

==Physics without the principle==
The standard model of cosmology, the [[Lambda-CDM model]], assumes the Copernican principle and the more general [[Cosmological principle]] and observations are largely consistent but there are always [[Unsolved problems in physics#Astronomy and astrophysics|unsolved problems]].  Some cosmologists and theoretical physicists design models lacking the Cosmological or Copernican principles, to constrain the valid values of observational results, to address specific known issues, and to propose tests to distinguish between current models and other possible models.

A prominent example in this context is the observed [[accelerating universe]] and the [[cosmological constant]] issue.  An alternative proposal to [[dark energy]] is that the universe is much more inhomogeneous than currently assumed, and specifically that we are in an extremely large low-density void.&lt;ref name=void&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = February | first1 = S. | last2 = Larena | first2 = J. | last3 = Smith | first3 = M. | last4 = Clarkson | first4 = C. | title = Rendering dark energy void | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2966.2010.16627.x | journal = Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society | pages = no | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = |arxiv = 0909.1479 |bibcode = 2010MNRAS.405.2231F }}&lt;/ref&gt;  To match observations we would have to be very close to the centre of this void, immediately contradicting the Copernican principle.

The '''Dehaene–Changeux model''' ('''DCM'''), also known as the '''global neuronal workspace''' or the '''global cognitive workspace model''' is a part of [[Bernard Baars]]'s "[[Global Workspace Theory|global workspace model]]" for consciousness.

It is a [[computer model]] of the [[neural correlates of consciousness]] programmed as a [[neural network]]. It attempts to reproduce the [[swarm behaviour]] {{clarify|date=November 2011}} of the [[brain]]'s ''higher cognitive functions'' such as [[consciousness]], [[decision-making]]&lt;ref&gt;Dehaene S, Changeux JP. '''Reward-dependent learning in neuronal networks for planning and decision making.''' Prog Brain Res. 2000;126:217-29.&lt;/ref&gt; and the central [[executive functions]]. It was developed by cognitive neuroscientists [[Stanislas Dehaene]] and [[Jean-Pierre Changeux]] beginning in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Dehaene S, Changeux JP. '''Experimental and theoretical approaches to conscious processing.''' Neuron. 2011 Apr 28;70(2):200-27.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been used to provide a predictive framework to the study of [[inattentional blindness]] and the solving of the [[Tower of London test]].&lt;ref&gt;Changeux JP, Dehaene S. '''Hierarchical neuronal modeling of cognitive functions: from synaptic transmission to the Tower of London.'''

'''Neural networks that learn temporal sequences by selection.''' Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1987 May;84(9):2727-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Dehaene–Changeux model was initially established as a [[spin glass]] neural network attempting to represent [[learning]] and to then provide a stepping stone towards [[machine learning|artificial learning]] among other objectives. It would later be used to predict observable reaction times within the [[Priming (psychology)|priming paradigm]]&lt;ref&gt;Epub 2010 Jan 25.

Conscious Cogn. 2010 Mar;19(1):86–97..&lt;/ref&gt; and in inattentional blindness.

==Structure==

===General structure===
The Dehaene–Changeux model is a meta neural network (i.e. a network of neural networks) composed of a very large number of [[integrate-and-fire]] [[neuron]]s programmed in either a [[stochastic]] or deterministic way. The neurons are organised in complex [[Thalamo-cortico-thalamic circuits|thalamo-cortical columns]] with long-range connexions and a critical role {{clarify|date=November 2011}} played by the interaction between [[Constantin von Economo|von Economo's areas]]. Each thalamo-cortical column is composed of [[pyramidal cell]]s and [[Interneuron|inhibitory interneurons]] receiving a long-distance excitatory [[Neuromodulation (biology)|neuromodulation]] which could represent [[noradrenergic]] input.

===A swarm and a multi-agent system composed of neural networks===
{{Synthesis|section|date=November 2011}}
Among others Cohen &amp; Hudson (2002) had already used "''Meta neural networks as intelligent agents for diagnosis ''"&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, M.E.;  Hudson, D.L.;  Meta neural networks as intelligent agents for diagnosis Neural Networks, 2002. IJCNN '02. Proceedings of the 2002 International Joint Conference on 233 – 238&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly to Cohen &amp; Hudson, Dehaene &amp; Changeux have established their model as an interaction of meta-neural networks (thalamocortical columns) themselves programmed in the manner of a "''hierarchy of neural networks that together act as an intelligent agent''", in order to use them as a system composed of a large scale of inter-connected intelligent agents for predicting the self-organized behaviour of the neural correlates of consciousness. It may also be noted that Jain et al. (2002) had already clearly identified [[spiking neuron]]s as intelligent agents&lt;ref&gt;L. C. Jain, Zhengxin Chen, Nikhil Ichalkaranje Intelligent agents and their applications Volume 98 de Studies in fuzziness and soft computing&lt;/ref&gt; since the lower bound for computational power of networks of [[Artificial neuron|spiking neurons]] is the capacity to simulate in real-time for boolean-valued inputs any [[Turing machine]].&lt;ref&gt;Maas, W. Lower Bound for the computational power of networks of spking neurons [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.55.933]&lt;/ref&gt; The '''DCM''' being composed of a very large number of interacting sub-networks which are themselves intelligent agents, it is formally a [[Multi-agent system]] programmed as a [[Swarm]] or neural networks and ''a fortiori'' of spiking neurons.

The authors provide the legend: "Shown are the constituents of the simulation (upper diagrams) and typical patterns of spontaneous activity that they can produce (lower tracings). We simulated a nested architecture in which spiking neurons (A) are incorporated within thalamocortical columns (B), which are themselves interconnected hierarchically by local and long-distance cortical connections (C) (see ''Materials and methods'' for details). While single neurons may generate sustained oscillations of [[membrane potential]]s (A), only the column and network levels generate complex waxing-and-waning [[Electroencephalography|EEG]]-like oscillations (B) and [[metastable]] global states of sustained firing (C)."&lt;ref&gt;Dehaene S, Changeux J-P (2005) '''Ongoing Spontaneous Activity Controls Access to Consciousness: A Neuronal Model for Inattentional Blindness.'''

==Behavior==
The DCM exhibits several surcritical {{clarify|date=November 2011}} [[Emergence|emergent behaviors]] such as [[multistability]] and a [[Hopf bifurcation]] between two very different regimes which may represent either [[sleep]] or [[arousal]] with a various [[all-or-none]] behaviors which Dehaene et al. use to determine a testable taxonomy between different states of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Dehaene S, Changeux JP, Naccache L, Sackur J, Sergent C. '''Conscious, preconscious, and subliminal processing: a testable taxonomy.''' Trends Cogn Sci. 2006 May;10(5):204-11. Epub 2006 Apr 17.&lt;/ref&gt; {{clarify|date=November 2011}}

==Scholarly reception==

===Self-organized criticality===
The Dehaene-Changeux Model contributed to the study of [[nonlinearity]] and [[self-organized criticality]] in particular as an explanatory model of the brain's emergent behaviors, including consciousness. Studying the brain's phase-locking and large-scale synchronization, Kitzbichler et al. (2011a) confirmed that criticality is a property of human brain functional network organization at all frequency intervals in the brain's physiological bandwidth.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzbichler MG, Smith ML, Christensen SR, Bullmore E. '''Broadband criticality of human brain network synchronization.''' PLoS Comput. Biol. 2009 Mar;5(3):e1000314. Epub 2009 Mar 20. {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, exploring the neural dynamics of cognitive efforts after, ''inter alia'', the Dehaene-Changeux Model, Kitzbichler et al. (2011b) demonstrated how cognitive effort breaks the [[modularity of mind]] to make human brain functional networks transiently adopt a more efficient but less economical configuration.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzbichler MG, Henson RN, Smith ML, Nathan PJ, Bullmore ET. '''Cognitive effort drives workspace configuration of human brain functional networks.''' J Neurosci. 2011 Jun 1;31(22):8259-70.&lt;/ref&gt; Werner (2007a) used the Dehaene-Changeux Global Neuronal Workspace to defend the use of statistical physics approaches for exploring phase transitions, scaling and universality properties of the so-called "Dynamic Core" of the brain, with relevance to the macroscopic electrical activity in [[EEG]] and [[Electromyography|EMG]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cogprints.org/5275/1/BrainDynamics.pdf Werner G. '''Brain dynamics across levels of organization.''' J Physiol Paris. 2007 Jul–Nov;101(4–6):273-9. Epub 2008 Jan 8.]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, building from the Dehaene-Changeux Model, Werner (2007b) proposed that the application of the twin concepts of scaling and universality of the theory of non-equilibrium phase transitions can serve as an informative approach for elucidating the nature of underlying neural-mechanisms, with emphasis on the dynamics of recursively [[Reentry (neural circuitry)|reentrant]] activity flow in intracortical and cortico-subcortical neuronal loops. [[Karl Friston|Friston]] (2000) also claimed that "''the nonlinear nature of asynchronous coupling enables the rich, context-sensitive interactions that characterize real brain dynamics, suggesting that it plays a role in functional integration that may be as important as synchronous interactions''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1692735/pdf/10724457.pdf | pmc=1692735 | pmid=10724457 | doi=10.1098/rstb.2000.0560 | volume=355 | title=The labile brain.

===States of consciousness and phenomenology===
It contributed to the study of phase transition in the brain under sedation, and notably GABA-ergic sedation such as that induced by propofol (Murphy et al. 2011, Stamatakis et al. 2010).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coma.ulg.ac.be/papers/vs/murphy_propofol.pdf Murphy M, Bruno MA, Riedner BA, Boveroux P, Noirhomme Q, Landsness EC, Brichant JF, Phillips C, Massimini M, Laureys S, Tononi G, Boly M.Propofol '''anesthesia and sleep: a high-density EEG study.''' Sleep. 2011 Mar 1;34(3):283-91A.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0014224 Stamatakis EA, Adapa RM, Absalom AR, Menon DK. '''Changes in resting neural connectivity during propofol sedation.''' PLoS One. 2010 Dec 2;5(12):e14224.] {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dehaene-Changeux Model was contrasted and cited in the study of [[collective consciousness]] and its pathologies (Wallace et al. 2007).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tbiomed.com/content/4/1/10 Wallace RM, Fullilove MT, Fullilove RE, Wallace DN. '''Collective consciousness and its pathologies: understanding the failure of AIDS control and treatment in the United States.''' Theor Biol Med Model. 2007 Feb 26;4:10. ]&lt;/ref&gt; Boly et al. (2007) used the model for a reverse somatotopic study, demonstrating a correlation between baseline brain activity and somatosensory perception in humans.&lt;ref&gt;Boly M, Balteau E, Schnakers C, Degueldre C, Moonen G, Luxen A, Phillips C, Peigneux P, Maquet P, Laureys S. '''Baseline brain activity fluctuations predict somatosensory perception in humans.''' Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2007 Jul 17;104(29):12187-92. Epub 2007 Jul 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Boly et al. (2008) also used the DCM in a study of the baseline state of consciousness of the human brain's [[default network]].&lt;ref&gt;Boly M, Phillips C, Tshibanda L, Vanhaudenhuyse A, Schabus M, Dang-Vu TT, Moonen G, Hustinx R, Maquet P, Laureys S.

'''Distinction''', the fundamental philosophical [[abstraction]], involves the recognition of difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sokolowski|first=Robert|date=1998-01-01|title=The Method of Philosophy: Making Distinctions|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/SOKTMO|journal=Review of Metaphysics|volume=51|issue=3|pages=515–532}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In classical philosophy, there were various ways in which things could be distinguished. The merely logical or virtual distinction, such as the difference between concavity and convexity, involves the mental apprehension of two definitions, but which cannot be realized outside the mind, as any concave line would be a convex line considered from another perspective. A real distinction involves a level of [[Ontology|ontological]] separation, as when squirrels are distinguished from llamas (for no squirrel is a llama, and no llama is a squirrel).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KmhCGt9hKC8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=copleston+history+of+philosophy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiKq8HBtozTAhUIRCYKHecUDC8Q6AEIHzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=formal%20distinction&amp;f=false|title=History of Philosophy Volume 2: Medieval Philosophy|last=Copleston|first=Frederick|date=2003-06-12|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9780826468963|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A real distinction is thus different than a merely conceptual one, in that in a real distinction, one of the terms can be realized in reality without the other being realized.

Later developments include [[Duns Scotus|Duns Scotus's]] [[formal distinction]], which developed in part out of the recognition in previous authors that there need to be an intermediary between logical and real distinctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wengert|first=R. G.|last2=Institute|first2=The Hegeler|date=1965-11-01|title=The Development of the Doctrine of the Formal Distinction in the Lectura Prima of John Duns Scotus|url=https://www.pdcnet.org//pdc/bvdb.nsf/purchase?openform&amp;fp=monist&amp;id=monist_1965_0049_0004_0571_0587&amp;onlyautologin=true|journal=Monist|volume=49|issue=4|pages=571–587|doi=10.5840/monist196549435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some relevant distinctions to the history of Western philosophy include:
* [[Contingency (philosophy)|Necessity and Contingency]]
* [[Inductive reasoning|Inductive]] and [[Deductive reasoning|Deductive]]

== Distinctions in Contemporary Thought ==

=== [[Analytic–synthetic distinction]] ===
While the there are anticipation of this distinction prior to Kant in the British [[Empiricism|Empiricists]] (and even further in [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] thought), it was Kant who introduced the terminology. The distinction concerns the relation of a subject to its predicate: analytic claims are those in which the subject contains the predicate, as in "All bodies are extended." Synthetic claims bring two concepts together, as in "All events are caused." The distinction was recently called into question by [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W.V.O. Quine]], in his paper "[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]."

=== [[A priori and a posteriori|''A priori'' and ''a posteriori'']] ===
The origins of the distinction are less clear, and it concerns the origins of [[knowledge]]. ''A posteriori'' knowledge arises from, or is caused by, experience. ''A priori'' knowledge may come temporally after experience, but its certainty is not derivable from the experience itself. [[Saul Kripke]] was the first major think to propose that there are analytic ''a posteriori'' knowledge claims.

== Notable Distinctions in Historical Authors ==

=== Aristotle ===
[[Aristotle]] makes the distinction between [[Potentiality and actuality|actuality and potentiality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/aristotle-metaphysics/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Cohen|first=S. Marc|date=2016-01-01|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actuality is a realization of the way a thing could be, while potency refers simply to the way a thing could be. There are two levels to each: matter itself can be anything, and becomes something actually by [[Four causes|causes]], making it something which then has the ability to be in a certain way, and that ability can then be realized. The matter of an ax can be an ax, then is made into an ax. The ax thereby is able to cut, and reaches a new form of actuality in actually cutting.

=== Aquinas ===
The major distinction [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]] makes is that of [[essence]] and [[existence]]. It is a distinction already in [[Avicenna]], but Aquinas maps the distinction onto the actuality/potentiality distinction of Aristotle, such that the essence of a thing is in potency to the existence of a thing, which is that thing's actuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/aq-meta/#H2|title=Aquinas: Metaphysics {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kant ===
In [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], the distinction between appearance and thing-in-itself is foundational to his entire philosophical project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Colin|first=Marshall,|title=Kant’s One Self and the Appearance/Thing-in-itself Distinction|url=https://www.academia.edu/2573493/Kants_one_self_and_the_appearance_thing-in-itself_distinction|journal=Kant-Studien|language=en|volume=104|issn=0022-8877}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction separates the way a thing appears to us on the one hand, and the way a thing really is.

An '''explanatory model''' is a useful description of why and how a thing works or an explanation of why a phenomenon is the way it is. The explanatory model is used as a substitute for "the&amp;nbsp;full&amp;nbsp;explanation" of the thing in question: 
* either because the full&amp;nbsp;explanation is unavailable
* or because the&amp;nbsp;full&amp;nbsp;explanation is too cumbersome to be practical in the case at hand.

Explanatory models do not claim to be a complete description/explanation of the absolute about the thing/phenomenon, nor do they even claim to, necessarily, be fully accurate. The description/explanation does, however, need to fit well enough to a sufficient portion of all the knowledge, observations and theoretical circumstances known about the thing/phenomenon, so that the explanatory model becomes useful.
That is: the description/explanation in an explanatory model, should be useful/helpful when one is about to make a decision or choice or when trying to successfully understand, explain or in some other way relate to the reality of the world around .Tewodros kassa

==Use of the term==
As most, if not all, explanations of anything, to a certain degree depend on [[axiom]]s, and thereby are incomplete and not really "the&amp;nbsp;''full''&amp;nbsp;explanation", then, strictly speaking, all explanations are in fact explanatory models.&lt;br&gt;
Yet,  the term "explanatory model" generally is used only when one feels the need to ''emphasize awareness of'' the incompleteness of an explanation (due to intentional simplification or due to lack of knowledge and understanding).

==Utility==
By being mindful of the difference between on the one hand: "absolute reality" and on the other hand: "the explanatory models that one has become accustomed to", then one will be better equipped to avoid erroneously rejecting important new knowledge, even when this new knowledge seem to clearly contradict that which one "knows" from before.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7500">A '''first principle''' is a basic, foundational, self-evident [[proposition]] or assumption that cannot be deduced from any other proposition or assumption. In [[philosophy]], first principles are taught by [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelians]], and nuanced versions of first principles are referred to as [[postulate]]s by [[Kantian]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Vernon Bourke, ''Ethics'', (New York: The Macmillan Co., 1966), 14.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[mathematics]], first principles are referred to as [[axiom]]s or postulates. In physics and other sciences, theoretical work is said to be from first principles, or ''[[ab initio]]'', if it starts directly at the level of established science and does not make assumptions such as empirical model and parameter fitting.

==In formal logic==
In a formal [[logical system]], that is, a set of [[proposition]]s that are consistent with one another, it is [[Logical possibility|possible]] that some of the statements can be deduced from other statements. For example, in the [[syllogism]], ''"All men are mortal; Socrates is a man; Socrates is mortal"'' the last claim can be deduced from the first two.

A first principle is an [[Axiom#Mathematical logic#Logical axioms|axiom]] that cannot be deduced from any other within that system. The classic example is that of [[Euclid's Elements]]; its hundreds of geometric propositions can be deduced from a set of definitions, postulates, and common notions: all three types constitute first principles.

==Philosophy in general==
In philosophy "first principles" are also commonly referred to as ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' terms and arguments, which are contrasted to ''[[a posteriori]]'' terms, reasoning or arguments, in that the former are simply assumed and exist prior to the reasoning process and the latter are deduced or inferred after the initial reasoning process. First principles are generally treated in the realm of philosophy known as [[epistemology]], but are an important factor in any [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] speculation.  

In philosophy "first principles" are often somewhat synonymous with ''[[A priori knowledge|a priori]]'', datum and [[axiomatic reasoning]].

==Aristotle's contribution==
[[Terence Irwin]] writes:
{{quote|When Aristotle explains in general terms what he tries to do in his philosophical works, he says he is looking for "first principles" (or "origins"; archai):
:In every systematic inquiry (methodos) where there are first principles, or causes, or elements, knowledge and science result from acquiring knowledge of these; for we think we know something just in case we acquire knowledge of the primary causes, the primary first principles, all the way to the elements. It is clear, then, that in the science of nature as elsewhere, we should try first to determine questions about the first principles. The naturally proper direction of our road is from things better known and clearer to us, to things that are clearer and better known by nature; for the things known to us are not the same as the things known unconditionally (haplôs). Hence it is necessary for us to progress, following this procedure, from the things that are less clear by nature, but clearer to us, towards things that are clearer and better known by nature. (Phys. 184a10–21)
The connection between knowledge and first principles is not axiomatic as expressed in Aristotle's account of a first principle (in one sense) as "the first basis from which a thing is known" (Met. 1013a14–15). The search for first principles is not peculiar to philosophy; philosophy shares this aim with biological, meteorological, and historical inquiries, among others. But Aristotle's references to first principles in this opening passage of the Physics and at the start of other philosophical inquiries imply that it is a primary task of philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;

==Descartes==
Profoundly influenced by [[Euclid]], [[Descartes]] was a [[rationalist]] who invented the [[foundationalist]] system of philosophy. He used the ''method of doubt'', now called [[Cartesian doubt]], to systematically doubt everything he could possibly doubt, until he was left with what he saw as purely indubitable truths. Using these self-evident propositions as his axioms, or foundations, he went on to deduce his entire body of knowledge from them. The foundations are also called ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' truths. His most famous proposition is "Je pense, donc je suis." (''I think, therefore I am'', or ''[[Cogito ergo sum]]'')

Descartes describes the concept of a first principle in the following excerpt from the preface to the ''[[Principles of Philosophy]]'' (1644):
{{quote|I should have desired, in the first place, to explain in it what philosophy is, by commencing with the most common matters, as, for example, that the word philosophy signifies the study of wisdom, and that by wisdom is to be understood not merely prudence in the management of affairs, but a perfect knowledge of all that man can know, as well for the conduct of his life as for the preservation of his health and the discovery of all the arts, and that knowledge to subserve these ends must necessarily be deduced from first causes; so that in order to study the acquisition of it (which is properly called [284] philosophizing), we must commence with the investigation of those first causes which are called Principles. Now these principles must possess two conditions: in the first place, they must be so clear and evident that the human mind, when it attentively considers them, cannot doubt of their truth; in the second place, the knowledge of other things must be so dependent on them as that though the principles themselves may indeed be known apart from what depends on them, the latter cannot nevertheless be known apart from the former. It will accordingly be necessary thereafter to endeavor so to deduce from those principles the knowledge of the things that depend on them, as that there may be nothing in the whole series of deductions which is not perfectly manifest.&lt;ref&gt;VOL I, Principles, Preface to the French edition. Author’s letter to the translator of the book which may here serve as a preface, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; }}

==In physics==
In [[physics]], a calculation is said to be ''from first principles'', or ''[[ab initio]]'', if it starts directly at the level of established laws of physics and does not make assumptions such as empirical [[Physical model|model]] and [[Curve fitting|fitting]] parameters.

For example, calculation of [[electronic structure]] using [[Schrödinger's equation]] within a set of approximations that do not include fitting the model to experimental data is an [[ab initio quantum chemistry methods|''ab initio'' approach]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3528">'''Gossen's Second “Law”''', named for [[Hermann Heinrich Gossen]] (1810–1858), is the assertion that an [[Economics|economic]] agent will allocate his or her expenditures such that the ratio of the [[marginal utility]] of each [[Good (economics)|good]] or [[Service (economics)|service]] to its price (the marginal expenditure necessary for its acquisition) is equal to that for every other good or service.  Formally,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial U/\partial x_i}{p_i}=\frac{\partial U/\partial x_j}{p_j}~\forall\left(i,j\right)&lt;/math&gt;
where
* &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is [[utility]]
* &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; is quantity of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th good or service
* &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; is the price of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th good or service

== Informal derivation ==
Imagine that an agent has spent money on various sorts of goods or services.  If the last unit of currency spent on goods or services of one sort bought a quantity with ''less'' marginal utility than that which would have been associated with the quantity of another sort that could have been bought with the money, then the agent would have been ''better off'' instead buying more of that other good or service.  Assuming that goods and services are continuously divisible, the only way that it is possible that the marginal expenditure on one good or service should not yield more utility than the marginal expenditure on the other (or ''vice versa'') is if the marginal expenditures yield ''equal'' utility.

== Formal derivation ==
Assume that utility, goods, and services have the requisite properties so that &lt;math&gt;\partial U/\partial x_i&lt;/math&gt; is [[Well-defined|well defined]] for each good or service.  An agent then optimizes
:&lt;math&gt;U\left(x_1 ,x_2 ,\dots,x_n\right)&lt;/math&gt;
subject to a [[budget constraint]]
:&lt;math&gt;W\geq\sum_{i=1}^n \left(p_i\cdot x_i \right)&lt;/math&gt;
where
* &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is the total available sum of money
Using the method of [[Lagrange multipliers]], one constructs the function
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}\left(x_1 ,x_2 ,\dots,x_n ,\lambda\right)=U\left(x_1 ,x_2 ,\dots,x_n\right)+\lambda\cdot\left[W-\sum_{i=1}^n \left(p_i\cdot x_i \right)\right]&lt;/math&gt;
and finds the first-order conditions for optimization as
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\lambda}=0&lt;/math&gt;
(which simply implies that all of &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; will be spent) and
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial x_i}=0~~\forall i&lt;/math&gt;
so that
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial U}{\partial x_i}-\lambda\cdot p_i =0~~\forall i&lt;/math&gt;
which is algebraically equivalent to
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial U/\partial x_i}{p_i}=\lambda~~\forall i&lt;/math&gt;
Since every such ratio is equal to &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, the ratios are all equal one to another:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial U/\partial x_i}{p_i}=\frac{\partial U/\partial x_j}{p_j}~\forall\left(i,j\right)&lt;/math&gt;

(Note that, as with any maximization using first-order conditions, the equations will hold only if the utility function satisfies specific concavity requirements and does not have maxima on the edges of the set over which one is maximizing.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4637">According to the '''growing block universe theory of time''' (or the '''growing block view'''), the past and present exist and the future does not exist. The present is an objective property, to be compared with a moving spotlight. By the passage of time more of the world comes into being; therefore, the block universe is said to be growing. The growth of the block is supposed to happen in the present, a very thin slice of [[spacetime]], where more of spacetime is continually coming into being.

The growing block view is an alternative to both [[eternalism (philosophy of time)|eternalism]] (according to which past, present, and future all exist) and [[presentism (philosophy of time)|presentism]] (according to which only the present exists). It is held to be closer to [[common sense|common-sense]] intuitions than the alternatives. [[C. D. Broad]] was a proponent of the theory (1923). Some modern defenders are [[Michael Tooley]] (in 1997) and [[Peter Forrest (philosopher)|Peter Forrest]] (in 2004).

==Criticism==
Recently several philosophers, David Braddon-Mitchell (2004), Craig Bourne and [[Trenton Merricks]] have noted that if the growing block view is correct then we have to conclude that we do not know whether now is now. (The first occurrence of "now" is an [[indexical]] and the second occurrence of "now" is the [[objective tensed property]]. Their observation implies the following sentence: "This part of spacetime has the property of being present".)

Take [[Socrates]] discussing, in the past, with [[Gorgias]], and at the same time thinking that the discussion is occurring now. According to the growing block view, [[Grammatical tense|tense]] is a real property of the world so his thought is about now, the objective present. He thinks, tenselessly, that his thought is occurring on the edge of being.  But we know he is wrong because he is in the past; he does not know that now is now. But how can we be sure we are not in the same position? There is nothing special with Socrates. Therefore, we do not know whether now is now.

However, some{{who|date=October 2017}} have argued that there is an ontological distinction between the past and the present. For instance, Forrest (2004) argues that although there exists a past, it is lifeless and inactive. Consciousness, as well as the flow of time, is not active within the past and can only occur at the boundary of the block universe in which the present exists.

In [[physics]], '''Hamilton's principle''' is [[William Rowan Hamilton]]'s formulation of the [[principle of stationary action]] (see that article for historical formulations). It states that the [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] of a physical system is determined by a [[calculus of variations|variational problem]] for a [[functional (mathematics)|functional]] based on a single function, the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]], which contains all physical information concerning the system and the forces acting on it. The variational problem is equivalent to and allows for the derivation of the ''[[differential equation|differential]]'' [[equations of motion]] of the physical system.  Although formulated originally for [[classical mechanics]], Hamilton's principle also applies to classical [[field (physics)|fields]] such as the [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] and [[gravity|gravitational]] [[field (physics)|fields]], and plays an important role in [[quantum mechanics]], [[quantum field theory]] and criticality theories.

The path taken by the system (red) has a stationary action (δ''S'' = 0) under small changes in the configuration of the system (δ'''q''').&lt;ref name=penrose&gt;{{cite book |author=R. Penrose| title=[[The Road to Reality]]| publisher= Vintage books| year=2007 | page = 474|isbn=0-679-77631-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

==Mathematical formulation==

Hamilton's principle states that the true evolution '''q'''(''t'') of a system described by ''N'' [[generalized coordinates]] '''q''' = (''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;) between two specified states '''q'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = '''q'''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and '''q'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = '''q'''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) at two specified times ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[stationary point]] (a point where the [[Calculus of variations|variation]] is zero), of the [[action (physics)|action]] [[functional (mathematics)|functional]]

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{S}[\mathbf{q}] \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  
\int_{t_1}^{t_2} L(\mathbf{q}(t),\dot{\mathbf{q}}(t),t)\, dt 
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;L(\mathbf{q},\dot{\mathbf{q}},t)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] [[function (mathematics)|function]] for the system.  In other words, any ''first-order'' perturbation of the true evolution results in (at most) ''second-order'' changes in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;.  The action &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[functional (mathematics)|functional]], i.e., something that takes as its input a [[function (mathematics)|function]] and returns a single number, a [[scalar (physics)|scalar]].  In terms of [[functional analysis]], Hamilton's principle states that the true evolution of a physical system is a solution of the functional equation

{{Equation box 1

\frac{\delta \mathcal{S}}{\delta \mathbf{q}(t)}=0
&lt;/math&gt;

===Euler–Lagrange equations derived from the action integral===

Requiring that the true trajectory '''q'''(''t'') be a [[stationary point]] of the action functional &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to a set of differential equations for '''q'''(''t'') (the '''Euler–Lagrange equations'''), which may be derived as follows.

Let '''q'''(''t'') represent the true evolution of the system between two specified states '''q'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = '''q'''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and '''q'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = '''q'''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) at two specified times ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and let '''ε'''(''t'') be a small perturbation that is zero at the endpoints of the trajectory

:&lt;math&gt;
\boldsymbol\varepsilon(t_1) = \boldsymbol\varepsilon(t_2) \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  0
&lt;/math&gt;

To first order in the perturbation '''ε'''(''t''), the change in the action functional &lt;math&gt;\delta\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; would be
:&lt;math&gt;
\delta \mathcal{S} = 
\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\;
\left[ L(\mathbf{q}+\boldsymbol\varepsilon,\dot{\mathbf{q}} +\dot{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}})- L(\mathbf{q},\dot{\mathbf{q}}) \right]dt = \int_{t_1}^{t_2}\; \left(
\boldsymbol\varepsilon \cdot \frac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{q}} + 
\dot{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}} \cdot \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}}  \right)\,dt      
&lt;/math&gt;

where we have expanded the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] ''L'' to first order in the perturbation '''ε'''(''t'').

Applying [[integration by parts]] to the last term results in

:&lt;math&gt;
\delta \mathcal{S} = 
\left[ \boldsymbol\varepsilon \cdot \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}}\right]_{t_1}^{t_2} + 
\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\; 
\left( \boldsymbol\varepsilon \cdot \frac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{q}}
- \boldsymbol\varepsilon \cdot \frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \right)\,dt
&lt;/math&gt;

The boundary conditions &lt;math&gt;
\boldsymbol\varepsilon(t_1) = \boldsymbol\varepsilon(t_2) \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  0
&lt;/math&gt; causes the first term to vanish

:&lt;math&gt;\delta \mathcal{S} = \int_{t_1}^{t_2}\; \boldsymbol\varepsilon \cdot\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{q}} - \frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \right)\,dt&lt;/math&gt;

Hamilton's principle requires that this first-order change &lt;math&gt;\delta \mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; is zero for all possible perturbations '''ε'''(''t''), i.e., the true path is a [[stationary point]] of the action functional &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; (either a minimum, maximum or saddle point).  This requirement can be satisfied if and only if

{{Equation box 1
|indent =:
|title='''[[Euler–Lagrange equations]]'''
|equation = &lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{q}} - \frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
|border=2
|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F5FFFA}}

These equations are called the Euler–Lagrange equations for the variational problem.

===Canonical momenta and constants of motion===

The '''conjugate momentum''' ''p&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' for a generalized coordinate ''q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' is defined by the equation

:&lt;math&gt;p_k \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_k}&lt;/math&gt;.

An important special case of the Euler–Lagrange equation occurs when ''L'' does not contain a generalized coordinate ''q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' explicitly,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial L}{\partial q_k}=0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_k} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{d p_k}{dt} = 0 \,,&lt;/math&gt;

that is, the conjugate momentum is a ''constant of the motion''.

In such cases, the coordinate ''q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' is called a '''cyclic coordinate'''.  For example, if we use polar coordinates ''t, r, θ'' to describe the planar motion of a particle, and if ''L'' does not depend on ''θ'', the conjugate momentum is the conserved angular momentum.

===Example: Free particle in polar coordinates===

Trivial examples help to appreciate the use of the action principle via the Euler–Lagrange equations. A free particle (mass ''m'' and velocity ''v'') in Euclidean space moves in a straight line. Using the Euler–Lagrange equations, this can be shown in [[coordinates (elementary mathematics)|polar coordinates]] as follows. In the absence of a potential, the Lagrangian is simply equal to the kinetic energy 
:&lt;math&gt; L = \frac{1}{2} mv^2= \frac{1}{2}m \left( \dot{x}^2 + \dot{y}^2 \right)&lt;/math&gt;
in orthonormal (''x'',''y'') coordinates, where the dot represents differentiation with respect to the curve parameter (usually the time, ''t''). Therefore, upon application of the Euler–Lagrange equations,

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{x}} \right) - \frac{\partial L}{\partial x} = 0 \qquad \Rightarrow  \qquad m\ddot{x} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

And likewise for ''y''. Thus the Euler–Lagrange formulation can be used to derive Newton's laws.

In polar coordinates (''r'', φ) the kinetic energy and hence the Lagrangian becomes

:&lt;math&gt; L = \frac{1}{2}m \left( \dot{r}^2 + r^2\dot{\varphi}^2 \right). &lt;/math&gt;

The radial ''r'' and ''φ'' components of the Euler–Lagrange equations become, respectively

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{r}} \right) - \frac{\partial L}{\partial r} = 0  \qquad
\Rightarrow  \qquad \ddot{r} -  r\dot{\varphi}^2 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\varphi}}  \right)-\frac{\partial L}{\partial \varphi} = 0  \qquad
\Rightarrow  \qquad \ddot{\varphi} + \frac{2}{r}\dot{r}\dot{\varphi} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The solution of these two equations is given by

:&lt;math&gt; r = \sqrt{(a t + b)^2 + c^2} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \varphi = \tan^{-1} \left( \frac{a t + b}{c} \right) + d &lt;/math&gt;

for a set of constants ''a, b, c, d'' determined by initial conditions.
Thus, indeed, ''the solution is a straight line'' given in polar coordinates: ''a'' is the velocity, ''c'' is the distance of the closest approach to the origin, and ''d'' is the angle of motion.

==Applied to deformable bodies==
Hamilton's principle is an important variational principle in [[Linear elasticity|elastodynamics]]. As opposed to a system composed of rigid bodies, deformable bodies have an infinite number of degrees of freedom and occupy continuous regions of space; consequently, the state of the system is described by using continuous functions of space and time. The extended Hamilton Principle for such bodies is given by

: &lt;math&gt; \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \left[ \delta W_e + \delta T - \delta U \right]dt = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where ''T'' is the kinetic energy, ''U'' is the elastic energy, ''W&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the work done by
external loads on the body, and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; the initial and final times. If the system is conservative, the work done by external forces may be derived from a scalar potential ''V''. In this case,

: &lt;math&gt; \delta \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \left[ T - (U + V) \right]dt = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

This is called Hamilton's principle and it is invariant under coordinate transformations.

==Comparison with Maupertuis' principle==

Hamilton's principle and [[Maupertuis' principle]] are occasionally confused and both have been called (incorrectly) the [[principle of least action]].  They differ in three important ways: 
* ''their definition of the [[action (physics)|action]]...'' 
:Maupertuis' principle uses an integral over the [[generalized coordinates]] known as the '''abbreviated action''' or [[reduced action]]
::&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}_{0} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \int \mathbf{p} \cdot d\mathbf{q}&lt;/math&gt; 
:where '''p''' = (''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''p&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;'') are the conjugate momenta defined above.  By contrast, Hamilton's principle uses &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;, the integral of the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] over [[time]].

*''the solution that they determine...''
:Hamilton's principle determines the trajectory '''q'''(''t'') as a function of time, whereas Maupertuis' principle determines only the shape of the trajectory in the generalized coordinates.  For example, Maupertuis' principle determines the shape of the ellipse on which a particle moves under the influence of an inverse-square central force such as [[gravitation|gravity]], but does not describe ''per se'' how the particle moves along that trajectory.  (However, this time parameterization may be determined from the trajectory itself in subsequent calculations using the [[conservation of energy]]).  By contrast, Hamilton's principle directly specifies the motion along the ellipse as a function of time.

*''...and the constraints on the variation.''
:Maupertuis' principle requires that the two endpoint states ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; be given and that energy be conserved along every trajectory (same energy for each trajectory). This forces the endpoint times to be varied as well. By contrast, Hamilton's principle does not require the conservation of energy, but does require that the endpoint times ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; be specified as well as the endpoint states ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Action principle for fields==

===Classical field theory===

{{main|Classical field theory}}

The '''action principle''' can be extended to obtain the [[equations of motion]] for [[field (physics)|fields]], such as the [[electromagnetic field]] or [[Einstein–Hilbert action|gravity]].

The [[Einstein equation]] utilizes the ''[[Einstein–Hilbert action]]'' as constrained by a [[variational principle]].

The path of a body in a gravitational field (i.e. free fall in space time, a so-called geodesic) can be found using the action principle.

===Quantum mechanics and quantum field theory===

{{main|Quantum field theory}}

In [[quantum mechanics]], the system does not follow a single path whose action is stationary, but the behavior of the system depends on all imaginable paths and the value of their action. The action corresponding to the various paths is used to calculate the [[Path integral formulation|path integral]], that gives the [[probability amplitude]]s of the various outcomes.

Although equivalent in classical mechanics with [[Newton's laws]], the '''action principle''' is better suited for generalizations and plays an important role in modern physics.  Indeed, this principle is one of the great generalizations in physical science. In particular, it is fully appreciated and best understood within [[quantum mechanics]]. [[Richard Feynman]]'s [[path integral formulation]] of quantum mechanics is based on a stationary-action principle, using path integrals. [[Maxwell's equations]] can be derived as conditions of stationary action.

'''Hume's fork''' is an explanation, developed by later [[philosopher]]s, of [[David Hume]]'s 1730s division of "relations of ideas" from "matters of fact and real existence".&lt;ref name=Flew&gt;[[Antony Flew]], ''A Dictionary of Philosophy'', rev 2nd edn (New York: St Martin's Press, 1984), [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA156&amp;dq=Hume's+fork p 156].&lt;/ref&gt;  A distinction is made between [[Modal logic|necessary]] versus [[contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] (concerning reality), {{nowrap|''[[A priori knowledge|a priori]]''}} versus {{nowrap|''[[a posteriori]]''}} (concerning knowledge), and [[analytic-synthetic distinction|analytic]] versus [[analytic-synthetic distinction|synthetic]] (concerning language). Relations of abstract ideas align on one side (necessary, ''a priori'', analytic), whereas concrete truths align on the other (contingent, ''a posteriori'', synthetic).&lt;ref name=Flew/&gt;

The "necessary" is generally true in all [[possible world]]s—usually by mere logical [[Validity (logic)|validity]]—whereas the "contingent" hinges on the way the real world is.  The ''a priori'' is knowable before or without, whereas the ''a posteriori'' is knowable only after or through, experience in an area of interest. The "analytic" is a statement true by virtue of its terms' meanings, and therefore a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]]—necessarily true but uninformative—whereas the "synthetic" is true by its terms' [[semantics|meanings]] in relation to a state of facts. In other words, analytic propositions are true by virtue of their meaning, while synthetic propositions are true by how their meaning relates to the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rey|first=Georges|title=The Analytic/Synthetic Distinction|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/analytic-synthetic/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2010 Edition)|accessdate=February 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers have used the terms differently, and there is debate over whether there is a legitimate distinction. 

==History&lt;!--'Kant's pitchfork' redirects here--&gt;==
Hume's strong [[empiricism]], as in Hume's fork as well as Hume's [[problem of induction]], was taken as a threat to [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s theory of motion.  [[Immanuel Kant]] responded with [[rationalism]] in his 1781 ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', where Kant attributed to the mind a causal role in sensory experience by the mind's aligning the environmental input by arranging those [[sense data]] into the experience of space and time.  Kant thus reasoned existence of the synthetic ''a priori''—combining meanings of terms with states of facts, yet known true without experience of the particular instance—replacing the two prongs of Hume's fork with a three-pronged-fork thesis ('''Kant's pitchfork'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;Hanna, Robert, ''Kant and the Foundations of Analytic Philosophy''. Clarendon Press, 2004. p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; and thus saving [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]].

[[Solar eclipse of May 29, 1919|In 1919]], Newton's theory fell to Einstein's [[general theory of relativity]]. In the late 1920s, the [[logical positivism|logical positivists]] rejected Kant's synthetic ''a priori'' and asserted Hume's fork, so called, while hinging it at language—the analytic/synthetic division—while presuming that by holding to analyticity, they could develop a [[logical syntax]] entailing, as a consequence of Hume's fork, both necessity and aprioricity, thus restricting science to claims [[verificationism|verifiable]] as either [[truth value|false or true]].  In the early 1950s, [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] undermined the analytic/synthetic division by explicating [[ontological relativity]], as every term in any statement has its meaning contingent on a vast network of knowledge and belief, the speaker's conception of the entire world.  By the early 1970s, [[Saul Kripke]] established the necessary ''a posteriori'', since if the [[Venus|Morning Star]] and the [[Venus|Evening Star]] are the same star, they are the same star by necessity, but this is known true by a human only through relevant experience.

Hume's fork remains basic in Anglo-American philosophy.  Many deceptions and confusions are foisted by surreptitious or unwitting conversion of a synthetic claim to an analytic claim, rendered true by necessity but merely a tautology, for instance the [[No true Scotsman|''No true Scotsman'' move]].  Simply put, Hume's fork has limitations. Related concerns are Hume's distinction of demonstrative versus probable reasoning&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Bunnin &amp; Jiyuan Yu. "Hume's Fork".  ''Blackwell's Dictionary of Western Philosophy''.  Blackwell, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garrett Thomson, ''Bacon to Kant: An Introduction to Modern Philosophy'', 2nd Edition, p 218.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hume's law]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Bunnin and Jiyuan Yu. "Hume's Fork". ''Blackwell's Dictionary of Western Philosophy''. Blackwell, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Hume makes other, important two-category distinctions, such as [[David Hume#Practical reason|beliefs versus desires]] and as impressions versus ideas.&lt;ref&gt;''Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'', Section II.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relations of ideas and matters of fact==

The first distinction is between two different areas of human study:

:All the objects of human reason or enquiry may naturally be divided into two kinds, to wit, ''relations of ideas'', and ''matters of fact''. Of the first kind are the sciences of [[Geometry]], [[Algebra]], and [[Arithmetic]] ...'' [which are] ''discoverable by the mere operation of thought ... Matters of fact, which are the second object of human reason, are not ascertained in the same manner; nor is our evidence of their truth, however great, of a like nature with the foregoing.
::: — ''[[An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding]]''&lt;ref&gt; ''Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'', Section IV, Part I.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume's fork is often stated in such a way that statements are divided up into two types:

* Statements about ideas. These are [[Analytic-synthetic distinction|analytic]], [[Modal logic|necessary]], and [[knowledge|knowable]] ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]''.
* Statements about the world. These are synthetic, [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingent]], and knowable ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]''.

In modern terminology, members of the first group are known as [[analytic proposition]]s and members of the latter as [[synthetic proposition]]s. This terminology comes from [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] (Introduction to ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', Section IV).

Into the first class fall statements such as ''"all bodies are extended"'', ''"all bachelors are unmarried"'', and truths of mathematics and logic. Into the second class fall statements like ''"the sun rises in the morning"'', and ''"all bodies have mass"''.

Hume wants to prove that [[certainty]] does not exist in science.  First, Hume notes that statements of the second type can never be entirely certain, due to the fallibility of our senses, the possibility of deception (see e.g. the modern [[brain in a vat]] theory) and other arguments made by philosophical skeptics. It is always logically possible that any given statement about the world is false.

Second, Hume claims that our belief in cause-and-effect relationships between events is not grounded on reason, but rather arises merely by habit or custom. Suppose one states: "Whenever someone on earth lets go of a stone it falls." While we can grant that in every instance thus far when a rock was dropped on Earth it went down, this does not make it logically necessary that in the future rocks will fall when in the same circumstances. Things of this nature rely upon the future conforming to the same principles which governed the past. But that isn't something that we can know based on past experience—all past experience could tell us is that in the past, the future has resembled the past.

Third, Hume notes that relations of ideas can be used only to prove other relations of ideas, and mean nothing outside of the context of how they relate to each other, and therefore tell us nothing about the world. Take the statement "An equilateral triangle has three sides of equal length." While some earlier philosophers (most notably [[Plato]] and [[Descartes]]) held that logical statements such as these contained the most formal reality, since they are always true and unchanging, Hume held that, while true, they contain no formal reality, because the truth of the statements rests on the definitions of the words involved, and not on actual things in the world, since there is no such thing as a true triangle or exact equality of length in the world. So for this reason, relations of ideas cannot be used to prove matters of fact.

The results claimed by Hume as consequences of his fork are drastic. According to him, relations of ideas can be proved with certainty (by using other relations of ideas), however, they don't really mean anything about the world. Since they don't mean anything about the world, relations of ideas cannot be used to prove matters of fact. Because of this, matters of fact have no certainty and therefore cannot be used to prove anything. Only certain things can be used to prove other things for certain, but only things about the world can be used to prove other things about the world. But since we can't cross the fork, nothing is both certain and about the world, only one or the other, and so it is impossible to prove something about the world with certainty.

If accepted, Hume's fork makes it pointless to try to prove the [[existence of God]] (for example) as a matter of fact. If God is not literally made up of physical matter, and does not have an observable effect on the world, making a statement about God is not a matter of fact. Therefore, a statement about God must be a relation of ideas. In this case if we prove the statement "God exists," it doesn't really tell us anything about the world; it is just playing with words. It is easy to see how Hume's fork voids the causal argument and the [[ontological argument]] for the existence of a non-observable God. However, this does not mean that the validity of Hume's fork would imply that God definitely does not exist, only that it would imply that the existence of God cannot be proven as a matter of fact without worldly evidence. 

Hume rejected the idea of any meaningful statement that did not fall into this schema, saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If we take in our hand any volume; of [[divinity]] or school [[metaphysics]], for instance; let us ask, Does it contain any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number? No. Does it contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence? No. Commit it then to the flames: for it can contain nothing but [[sophistry]] and illusion.{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=166|ps=, emphasis removed}} — ''[[An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding]]''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2857">The '''instantiation principle''' or '''principle of instantiation''' or '''principle of exemplification''' is the [[concept]] in [[metaphysics]] and [[logic]] (first put forward by [[David Malet Armstrong]]) that there can be no uninstantiated or unexemplified [[property (philosophy)|properties]] (or [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]]). In other words, it is impossible for a property to exist which is not had by some object.

Consider a chair. Presumably chairs did not exist 150,000 years ago. Thus, according to the principle of instantiation, the property of being a chair did not exist 150,000 years ago either. Similarly, if all red objects were to suddenly go out of existence, then the property of being red would likewise go out of existence.

To make the principle more plausible in the light of these examples, the existence of properties or universals is not tied to their actual existence now, but to their existence in space-time considered as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4445">[[File:Logical-hexagon.png|thumb|250px|right|The logical hexagon extends the [[square of opposition]] to six statements.]]

The '''logical hexagon''' (also called the '''hexagon of opposition''') is a [[conceptual model]] of the relationships between the [[truth value]]s of six [[statement (logic)|statement]]s. It is an extension of [[Aristotle]]'s [[square of opposition]]. It was discovered independently by both [[Augustin Sesmat]] and [[Robert Blanché]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://alessiomoretti.perso.sfr.fr/NOTLogicalHexagon.html N-opposition theory ''logical hexagon'']&lt;/ref&gt;

This extension consists in introducing two statements '''U''' and '''Y'''. Whereas '''U''' is the [[Logical disjunction|disjunction]] of '''A''' and '''E''', '''Y''' is the [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]] of the two traditional particulars '''I''' and '''O'''.

== Summary of relationships ==

The traditional square of opposition demonstrates two sets of contradictories '''A''' and '''O''', and '''E''' and '''I''' (i.e. they cannot both be true and cannot both be false), two contraries '''A''' and '''E''' (i.e. they can both be false, but cannot both be true), and two subcontraries '''I''' and '''O''' (i.e. they can both be true, but cannot both be false) according to Aristotle’s definitions. However, the logical hexagon provides that '''U''' and '''Y''' are also contradictory.

== Interpretations of the logical hexagon ==

The logical hexagon may be interpreted in various ways, including as a model of traditional logic, quantifications, modal logic, order theory, or paraconsistent logic.

For instance, the statement A may be interpreted as "Whatever x may be, if x is a man, then x is white."

    (x)(M(x) → W(x))

The statement E may be interpreted as "Whatever x may be, if x is a man, then x is non-white."

    (x)(M(x) → ~W(x))

The statement I may be interpreted as "There exists at least one x that is both a man and white."

The logical hexagon may be interpreted in various ways, including as a model of traditional logic, quantifications, modal logic, order theory, or paraconsistent logic.



=== Modal logic ===

The logical hexagon may be interpreted as a model of modal logic such that

* '''A''' is interpreted as [[necessary and sufficient condition|necessity]]
* '''E''' is interpreted as impossibility
* '''I''' is interpreted as [[logical possibility|possibility]]
* '''O''' is interpreted as 'not necessarily'
* '''U''' is interpreted as non-contingency
* '''Y''' is interpreted as [[contingency (philosophy)|contingency]]

== Further extension ==
It has been proven that both the square and the hexagon, followed by a “[[logical cube]]”, belong to a regular series of n-dimensional objects called “logical bi-simplexes of dimension n.” The pattern also goes even beyond this.&lt;ref&gt;Moretti, Pellissier&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3805">In [[economics]], '''marginal concepts''' are associated with a ''specific change'' in the quantity used of a [[Good (economics)|good]] or [[Service (economics)|service]], as opposed to some notion of the over-all significance of that class of good or service, or of some total quantity thereof.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

== Marginality ==

Constraints are conceptualized as a ''border'' or ''margin''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Wicksteed|Wicksteed, Philip Henry]]; ''The Common Sense of Political Economy'' (1910), Bk I Ch 2 and elsewhere.&lt;/ref&gt;  The location of the margin for any individual corresponds to his or her ''endowment'', broadly conceived to include opportunities.  This endowment is determined by many things including physical laws (which constrain how forms of energy and matter may be transformed), accidents of nature (which determine the presence of natural resources), and the outcomes of past decisions made both by others and by the individual himself or herself.

A value that holds true given particular constraints is a [[marginal value|''marginal'' value]].  A change that would be affected as or by a specific loosening or tightening of those constraints is a ''marginal'' change, as large as the smallest relevant division of that good or service.&lt;ref name="wieser_ein"&gt;von Wieser, Friedrich; ''Über den Ursprung und die Hauptgesetze des wirtschaftlichen Wertes'' &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''The Nature and Essence of Theoretical Economics''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; (1884), p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;  For reasons of tractability, it is often assumed in [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical analysis]] that goods and services are [[Continuum (theory)|continuously divisible]].  In such context, a marginal change may be an [[infinitesimal]] change or a [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]].  However, strictly speaking, the smallest relevant division may be quite large.

== Some important marginal concepts ==

The '''[[marginal use]]''' of a [[Good (economics)|good or service]] is the specific use to which an agent would put a given increase, or the specific use of the good or service that would be abandoned in response to a given decrease.&lt;ref name="wieser_ein" /&gt;

The '''[[marginal utility]]''' of a [[Good (economics)|good or service]] is the [[utility]] of the specific use to which an agent would put a given increase in that good or service, or of the specific use that would be abandoned in response to a given decrease.  In other words, marginal utility is the utility of the  [[marginal use]].

The '''[[marginal rate of substitution]]''' is the rate of substitution is the least favorable rate, at the margin, at which an agent is willing to exchange units of one good or service for units of another.

A '''[[marginal benefit]]''' is a benefit (howsoever ranked or measured) associated with a marginal change.

The term “'''[[marginal cost]]'''” may refer to an [[opportunity cost]] at the margin, or to marginal ''[[Money|pecuniary]]'' cost — that is to say marginal cost measured by forgone money.

Other marginal concepts include (but are not limited to):
* [[marginal product|marginal physical product]] (sometimes also known as “marginal product”)
* [[marginal rate of transformation]], the rate at which one output or result must be sacrificed in order to increase another output or result
* [[marginal revenue product]]
* [[marginal propensity to save]] and [[marginal propensity to consume|consume]]
* [[marginal tax rate]]

'''[[Marginalism]]''' is the use of marginal concepts to explain economic phenomena.

The related concept of [[elasticity (economics)|elasticity]] is the ratio of the incremental percentage change in one variable with respect to an incremental percentage change in another variable.

In [[economics]], the '''marginal propensity to consume''' ('''MPC''') is a metric that quantifies [[induced consumption]], the concept that the increase in personal consumer spending ([[consumption (economics)|consumption]]) occurs with an increase in [[disposable income]] (income after taxes and transfers). The proportion of disposable income which individuals spend on consumption is known as propensity to consume. MPC is the proportion of additional income that an individual consumes. For example, if a household earns one extra dollar of disposable income, and the marginal propensity to consume is 0.65, then of that dollar, the household will spend 65 cents and save 35 cents. Obviously, the household cannot spend ''more'' than the extra dollar (without borrowing).

According to [[John Maynard Keynes]], marginal propensity to consume is less than one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Keynes |first=John M. |title=[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]] |location=New York |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |page=96 |year=1936 |quote=The fundamental psychological law ... is that men [and women] are disposed, as a rule and on average, to increase their consumption as their income increases, but not as much as the increase in their income. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Mathematically, the &lt;math&gt;\mathit{MPC}&lt;/math&gt; function is expressed as the [[derivative]] of the [[consumption function]] &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; with respect to disposable income &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., the instantaneous slope of the &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;-&lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; curve.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathit{MPC}=\frac{dC}{dY}&lt;/math&gt;

or, approximately,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathit{MPC} = \frac{\Delta C}{\Delta Y}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\Delta C&lt;/math&gt; is the change in consumption, and &lt;math&gt;\Delta Y&lt;/math&gt; is the change in disposable income that produced the consumption.
Marginal propensity to consume can be found by dividing change in consumption by a change in income, or &lt;math&gt;\mathit{MPC}=\Delta C/\Delta Y&lt;/math&gt;. The MPC can be explained with the simple example:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Income!! Consumption
|-
| 120 || 120
|-
| 180 || 170
|}
		
Here &lt;math&gt;\Delta C= 50&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;\Delta Y= 60&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, &lt;math&gt;\mathit{MPC}=\Delta C/\Delta Y= 50/60= 0.83&lt;/math&gt; or 83%.
For example, suppose you receive a bonus with your paycheck, and it's $500 on top of your normal annual earnings. You suddenly have $500 more in income than you did before. If you decide to spend $400 of this marginal increase in income on a new business suit, your marginal propensity to consume will be 0.8 (&lt;math&gt;\$400/\$500&lt;/math&gt;).

[[File:MPC.png|thumb|The above figure illustrates the consumption function. The slope of the consumption function tells us how much consumption increases when disposable income increases by one currency unit. That is, the slope of the consumption function is the MPC.]]

The marginal propensity to consume is measured as the ratio of the change in consumption to the change in income, thus giving us a figure between 0 and 1. The MPC can be more than one if the subject borrowed money or dissaved to finance expenditures higher than their income. The MPC can also be less than zero if an increase in income leads to a reduction in consumption (which might occur if, for example, the increase in income makes it worthwhile to save up for a particular purchase). One minus the MPC equals the [[marginal propensity to save]] (in a two sector closed economy), which is crucial to [[Keynesian economics]] and a key variable in determining the value of the [[Multiplier (economics)|multiplier]].

In a standard Keynesian model, the MPC is less than the [[average propensity to consume]] (APC) because in the short-run some (autonomous) consumption does not change with income.  Falls (increases) in income do not lead to reductions (increases) in consumption because people reduce (add to) savings to stabilize consumption.  Over the long-run, as wealth and income rise, consumption also rises; the marginal propensity to consume out of long-run income is closer to the average propensity to consume.

The MPC is not strongly influenced by interest rates; consumption tends to be stable relative to income.  In theory one might think that higher interest rates would induce more saving (the substitution effect) but higher interest rates also mean than people do not have to save as much for the future.

Economists often distinguish between the marginal propensity to consume out of permanent income, and the marginal propensity to consume out of temporary income, because if consumers expect a change in income to be permanent, then they have a greater incentive to increase their consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Barro |first2=Vittorio |last2=Grilli |year=1994 |title=European Macroeconomics |location= |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=0333577647 |pages=417–8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that the Keynesian [[Multiplier (economics)|multiplier]] should be ''larger'' in response to permanent changes in income than it is in response to temporary changes in income (though the earliest Keynesian analyses ignored these subtleties). However, the distinction between permanent and temporary changes in income is often subtle in practice, and it is often quite difficult to designate a particular change in income as being permanent or temporary. What is more, the marginal propensity to consume should also be affected by factors such as the prevailing interest rate and the general level of [[consumer surplus]] that can be derived from purchasing.

== MPC and the multiplier ==
MPC's importance depends on the multiplier theory. MPC determines the value of the multiplier. The higher the MPC, the higher the multiplier and vice versa. The relationship between the multiplier and the propensity to consume is as follows:
:                                                 &lt;math&gt; Y = C+I &lt;/math&gt;
:                                                &lt;math&gt; \Delta Y = \Delta C + \Delta I &lt;/math&gt;
:                                                &lt;math&gt; \Delta Y = c\Delta Y + \Delta I &lt;/math&gt;               (where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\mathit{MPC}&lt;/math&gt;)
:                                                &lt;math&gt; \Delta Y - c\Delta Y = \Delta I&lt;/math&gt;
:                                                &lt;math&gt; \Delta Y(1-c) = \Delta I&lt;/math&gt;
:                                                &lt;math&gt; \Delta Y= \frac{\Delta I}{(1-c)}&lt;/math&gt;
:                                                &lt;math&gt; \frac {\Delta Y}{\Delta I} = \frac {1}{(1-c)}&lt;/math&gt;
:                                                 &lt;math&gt; K = \frac{1}{(1-c)} &lt;/math&gt;                   (where ,&lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is multiplier and &lt;math&gt;K = \frac {\Delta Y}{\Delta I})&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the MPC, the multiplier &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is, by definition, equal to &lt;math&gt;1/(1-MPC)&lt;/math&gt;. The multiplier can also be derived from MPS (marginal propensity to save) and it is the reciprocal of MPS, &lt;math&gt;K= 1/\mathit{MPS}&lt;/math&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!&lt;math&gt;\Delta C/\Delta Y&lt;/math&gt; (MPC)  !!&lt;math&gt;\Delta S/\Delta Y&lt;/math&gt; (MPS) [&lt;math&gt;1-\mathit{MPC}&lt;/math&gt;]!! |&lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; (multiplier coefficient)
|-
| 0 || 1 ||1
|-
| 1/2 || 1/2 || 2
|-
| 2/3 || 1/3 || 3
|-
| 3/4 || 1/4 || 4
|-
| 4/5 || 1/5 || 5
|-
| 8/9 || 1/9 || 9
|-
| 9/10 ||1/10 || 10
|-
| 1    || 0||  &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The above table shows that the size of the multiplier varies directly with the MPC and inversely with the MPS. Since the MPC is always greater than zero and less than one (i.e. &lt;math&gt;0&lt;\mathit{MPC} &lt;1&lt;/math&gt;), the multiplier is always between one and infinity (&lt;math&gt;1&lt;K&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;). If the multiplier is one, it means that the whole increment of income is saved and nothing is spent because the MPC is zero. On the other hand, an infinite multiplier implies that MPC is equal one and the entire increment of income is spent on consumption. It will soon lead to full employment in the economy and then create a limitless inflationary spiral. But these are rare phenomenon. Therefore, the multiplier coefficient varies between one and infinity.

== Significance of MPC ==
When income increases, the MPC falls but more than the APC. Conversely, when income falls, the MPC rises and the APC also rises but at a slower rate than the former. Such changes are only possible during cyclical fluctuations whereas in the short-run there is no change in the MPC and &lt;math&gt;\mathit{MPC}&lt;\mathit{APC}&lt;/math&gt;.
Keynes is concerned primarily with the MPC, for his analysis pertains to the short-run while the APC is useful in the long-run analysis. The post-Keynesian economists have come to the conclusion that over the long-run APC and MPC are equal and approximate 0.9. In the Keynesian analysis the MPC is given more prominence. Its value is assumed to be positive and less than unity which means that when income increases the whole of it is not spent on consumption. On the contrary, when income falls, consumption expenditure does not decline in the same proportion and never becomes zero. The Keynesian hypothesis is that the marginal propensity to consume is positive but less than unity (&lt;math&gt;0\le \Delta C/\Delta Y &lt;1&lt;/math&gt;) is of great analytical and practical significance. Besides telling us that consumption is an increasing function of income and it increases by less than the increment of income, this hypothesis helps in explaining
1)	The theoretical possibility of general [[overproduction]] or "[[underemployment equilibrium]]" and also
2)	The relative stability of a highly developed industrial economy. For it implies that the gap between income and consumption at all high levels of income is too wide to be easily filled by investment with the possible consequences that the economy may fluctuate around underemployment equilibrium.
Thus the economic significance of the MPC lies in filling the gap between income and consumption through planned investment to maintain the desired level of income.

=== MPC and nature of country ===
The MPC is higher in the case of poorer people than in rich&lt;ref&gt;http://equitablegrowth.org/equitablog/wealth-inequality-marginal-propensity-consume/&lt;/ref&gt;. When a person earns a higher income, the cost of their basic human needs amount to a smaller fraction of this income, and correspondingly their average propensity to save is higher than that of a person with a lower income. The marginal propensity to save of the richer classes is greater than that of the poorer classes. If, at any time, it is desired to increase aggregate consumption, then the purchasing power should be transferred from the richer classes (with low propensity to consume) to the poorer classes (with a higher propensity to consume). Likewise, if it is desired to reduce community consumption, the purchasing power must be taken away from the poorer classes by taxing consumption. The marginal propensity to consume is higher in a poor country and lower in the case of rich country. The reason is same as stated above. In the case of rich country, most common of the basic needs of the people have already been satisfied, and all the additional increments of income are saved, resulting in a higher marginal propensity to save but in a lower marginal propensity to consume. In a poor country, on the other hand, most of the basic needs of the people remain unsatisfied so that additional increments of income go to increase consumption, resulting in a higher marginal propensity to consume and a lower marginal propensity to save. This is the reason MPC is higher in the underdeveloped countries of Asia and Africa, and lower in developed countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Singapore and Germany.

=== The MPC of individuals ===
Much of the current discussion seems to rely on the MPC being unique to a country, and homogeneous across such an economic entity; and the theory and the mathematical formulae apply to this use of the term.  However, individuals have an MPC, and furthermore MPC is not homogeneous across society. Even if it was, the nature of the consumption is not homogeneous. Some consumption may be seen as more benevolent (to the economy) than others. Therefore, spending could be targeted where it would do most benefit, and thus generate the highest (closest to 1) MPC. This has traditionally been regarded as construction or other major projects (which also bring a direct benefit in the form of the finished product).
Clearly, some sectors of society are likely to have a much higher MPC than others. Someone with above average wealth or income or both may have a very low (short-term, at least) MPC of nearly zero—saving most of any extra income. But a pensioner, for example, will have an MPC of 1 or even greater than 1. This is because a pensioner is quite likely to spend every penny of any extra income. Further, if the extra income is seen as regular extra income, and guaranteed into the future, the pensioner may actually spend MORE than the extra £1. This would occur where the extra income stream gives confidence that the individual does not need to put aside as much in the form of savings; or perhaps can even dip into existing savings.
More importantly, this consumption is much more likely to occur in local small business—local shops, pubs and other leisure activities for example. These types of businesses are themselves likely to have a high MPC, and again the nature of their consumption is likely to be in the same, or next tier of businesses, and also of a benevolent nature.
Other individuals with a high, and benevolent, MPC would include almost anyone on a low income—students, parents with young children, and the unemployed.

Mental representation is the mental imagery of things that are not actually present to the senses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mckellar|first1=Peter|title=Imagination and thinking: A psychological analysis|date=1957|publisher=Oxford, England|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1958-00258-000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[contemporary philosophy]], specifically in fields of [[metaphysics]] such as [[philosophy of mind]] and [[ontology]], a mental representation is one of the prevailing ways of [[explanation|explaining]] and [[description|describing]] the nature of [[idea]]s and [[concept]]s.

Mental representations (or mental imagery) enable representing things that have never been experienced as well as things that do not exist.&lt;ref name="sternberg2009"&gt;{{cite book|author = Robert J. Sternberg|url = https://books.google.com/?id=la6mSK9vyIgC|title = Cognitive Psychology|year = 2009|isbn = 9780495506294}}&lt;/ref&gt; Think of yourself traveling to a place you have never visited before, or having a third arm. These things have either never happened or are impossible and do not exist, yet our brain and mental imagery allows us to imagine them. Although visual imagery is more likely to be recalled, mental imagery may involve representations in any of the sensory modalities, such as hearing, smell, or taste. [[Stephen Kosslyn]] proposes that images are used to help solve certain types of problems. We are able to visualize the objects in question and mentally represent the images to solve it.&lt;ref name="sternberg2009" /&gt;

Mental representations also allow people to experience things right in front of them—though the process of how the brain interprets the [[Mental content|representational content]] is debated.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

== Representational theories of mind ==

[[Representationalism]] (also known as [[Direct and indirect realism|indirect realism]]) is the view that representations are the main way we access external reality. Another major prevailing [[philosophical theory]] posits that concepts are entirely [[abstract object]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Ontology of Concepts—Abstract Objects or Mental Representations?|url=http://philosophy.dept.shef.ac.uk/papers/OntologyofConcepts.pdf|format=PDF|last1=Margolis|first1=Eric|last2=Laurence|first2=Stephen|authorlink2=Stephen Laurence|journal=Noûs|volume=41|issue=4|date=December 2007|pages=561–593|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0068.2007.00663.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The representational theory of mind attempts to [[explanation|explain]] the nature of [[idea]]s, [[concept]]s and other [[mental content]] in [[contemporary philosophy|contemporary]] [[philosophy of mind]], [[cognitive science]] and [[experimental psychology]]. In contrast to theories of naive or [[direct realism]], the representational theory of mind postulates the actual existence of mental representations which act as intermediaries between the [[observation|observing]] subject and the [[object (philosophy)|objects]], processes or other entities observed in the external world. These intermediaries stand for or represent to the mind the objects of that world.

For example, when someone arrives at the belief that his or her floor needs sweeping, the representational theory of mind states that he or she forms a mental representation that represents the floor and its state of cleanliness.

The original or "classical" representational theory probably can be traced back to [[Thomas Hobbes]] and was a dominant theme in classical [[empiricism]] in general. According to this version of the theory, the mental representations were images (often called "ideas") of the objects or states of affairs represented. For modern adherents, such as [[Jerry Fodor]], [[Steven Pinker]] and many others, the representational system consists rather of an internal [[Language of thought hypothesis|language of thought]] (i.e., mentalese). The contents of thoughts are represented in symbolic structures (the formulas of Mentalese) which, analogously to natural languages but on a much more abstract level, possess a [[syntax]] and [[semantics]] very much like those of natural languages. For the Spanish logician and cognitive scientist Luis M. Augusto, at this abstract, formal level, the syntax of thought is the set of symbol rules (i.e., operations, processes, etc. on and with symbol structures) and the semantics of thought is the set of symbol structures (concepts and propositions). Content (i.e., thought) emerges from the meaningful co-occurrence of both sets of symbols. For instance, "8 x 9" is a meaningful co-occurrence, whereas "CAT x §" is not; "x" is a symbol rule called for by symbol structures such as "8" and "9", but not by "CAT" and "§".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Unconscious representations 2: Towards an integrated cognitive architecture.|last = Augusto|first = Luis M.|date = 2014|journal = Axiomathes |volume=24|pages=19–43|doi = 10.1007/s10516-012-9207-y|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Strong vs weak, restricted vs unrestricted ===
There are two types of representationalism, strong and weak. Strong representationalism attempts to reduce phenomenal character to intentional content. On the other hand, weak representationalism claims only that phenomenal character supervenes on intentional content. Strong representationalism aims to provide a theory about the nature of phenomenal character, and offers a solution to the hard problem of consciousness. In contrast to this, weak representationalism does not aim to provide a theory of consciousness, nor does it offer a solution to the hard problem of consciousness.

Strong representationalism can be further broken down into restricted and unrestricted versions. The restricted version deals only with certain kinds of phenomenal states e.g. visual perception. Most representationalists endorse an unrestricted version of representationalism. According to the unrestricted version, for any state with phenomenal character that state’s phenomenal character reduces to its intentional content. Only this unrestricted version of representationalism is able to provide a general theory about the nature of phenomenal character, as well as offer a potential solution to the hard problem of consciousness. The successful reduction of the phenomenal character of a state to its intentional content would provide a solution to the hard problem of consciousness once a physicalist account of intentionality is worked out.

=== Problems for the unrestricted version ===
When arguing against the unrestricted version of representationalism people will often bring up phenomenal mental states that appear to lack intentional content. The unrestricted version seeks to account for all phenomenal states. Thus, for it to be true, all states with phenomenal character must have intentional content to which that character is reduced. Phenomenal states without intentional content therefore serve as a counterexample to the unrestricted version. If the state has no intentional content its phenomenal character will not be reducible to that state’s intentional content, for it has none to begin with.

A common example of this kind of state are moods. Moods are states with phenomenal character that are generally thought to not be directed at anything in particular. Moods are thought to lack directedness, unlike emotions, which are typically thought to be directed at particular things e.g. you are mad ''at'' your sibling, you are afraid ''of'' a dangerous animal. People conclude that because moods are undirected they are also nonintentional i.e. they lack intentionality or aboutness. Because they are not directed at anything they are not about anything. Because they lack intentionality they will lack any intentional content. Lacking intentional content their phenomenal character will not be reducible to intentional content, refuting the representational doctrine.

Though emotions are typically considered as having directedness and intentionality this idea has also been called into question. One might point to emotions a person all of a sudden experiences that do not appear to be directed at or about anything in particular. Emotions elicited by listening to music are another potential example of undirected, nonintentional emotions. Emotions aroused in this way do not seem to necessarily be about anything, including the music that arouses them.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Current Controversies in Philosophy of Mind|last = Kind|first = Amy|publisher = Routledge|year = 2014|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Responses&lt;!--'Directedness' redirects here--&gt; ===
In response to this objection a proponent of representationalism might reject the undirected nonintentionality of moods, and attempt to identify some intentional content they might plausibly be thought to possess. The proponent of representationalism might also reject the narrow conception of intentionality as being directed at a particular thing, arguing instead for a broader kind of intentionality.

There are three alternative kinds of '''directedness'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;/[[intentionality]] one might posit for moods.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
* Outward directedness: What it is like to be in mood M is to have a certain kind of outwardly focused representational content.
* Inward directedness: What it is like to be in mood M is to have a certain kind of inwardly focused representational content.
* Hybrid directedness: What it is like to be in mood M is to have both a certain kind of outwardly focused representational content and a certain kind of inwardly focused representational content.
In the case of outward directedness moods might be directed at either the world as a whole, a changing series of objects in the world, or unbound emotion properties projected by people onto things in the world. In the case of inward directedness moods are directed at the overall state of a person’s body. In the case of hybrid directedness moods are directed at some combination of inward and outward things.

=== Further objections ===
Even if one can identify some possible intentional content for moods we might still question whether that content is able to sufficiently capture the phenomenal character of the mood states they are a part of. Amy Kind contends that in the case of all the previously mentioned kinds of directedness (outward, inward, and hybrid) the intentional content supplied to the mood state is not capable of sufficiently capturing the phenomenal aspects of the mood states.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the case of inward directedness, the phenomenology of the mood does not seem tied to the state of one’s body, and even if one’s mood is reflected by the overall state of one’s body that person will not necessarily be aware of it, demonstrating the insufficiency of the intentional content to adequately capture the phenomenal aspects of the mood. In the case of outward directedness, the phenomenology of the mood and its intentional content do not seem to share the corresponding relation they should given that the phenomenal character is supposed to reduce to the intentional content. Hybrid directedness, if it can even get off the ground, faces the same objection.

== Philosophers ==
There is a wide debate on what kinds of representations exist. There are several philosophers who bring about different aspects of the debate. Such philosophers include Alex Morgan, Gualtiero Piccinini, and Uriah Kriegel—though this is not an exhaustive list.

=== Alex Morgan ===

There are "job description" representations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; That is representations that (1) represent something—have [[intentionality]], (2) have a special relation—the represented object does not need to exist, and (3) content plays a causal role in what gets represented:  e.g. saying "hello" to a friend, giving a glare to an enemy.

Structural representations are also important.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These types of representations are basically mental maps that we have in our minds that correspond exactly to those objects in the world (the intentional content). According to Morgan, structural representations are not the same as mental representations—there is nothing mental about them:  plants can have structural representations.

There are also internal representations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These types of representations include those that involve future decisions, episodic memories, or any type of projection into the future.

=== Gualtiero Piccinini ===

In [[Gualtiero Piccinini]]'s forthcoming work, he discusses topics on natural and nonnatural mental representations. He relies on the natural definition of mental representations given by Grice (1957)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Meaning|last = Grice|first = H.P.|date = 1957|journal = Philosophical Review |volume=66|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; where ''P entails that P''. e.g. Those spots mean measles, entails that the patient has measles. Then there are nonnatural representations:  ''P does not entail P''. e.g. The 3 rings on the bell of a bus mean the bus is full—the rings on the bell are independent of the fullness of the bus—we could have assigned something else (just as arbitrary) to signify that the bus is full.

=== Uriah Kriegel ===

There are also objective and subjective mental representations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Current Controversies in Philosophy of Mind|last = Kriegel|first = Uriah|publisher = Routledge|year = 2014|isbn = |location = |pages = 161–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objective representations are closest to tracking theories—where the brain simply tracks what is in the environment. If there is a blue bird outside my window, the objective representation is that of the blue bird. Subjective representations can vary person-to-person. For example, if I am colorblind, that blue bird outside my window will not ''appear'' blue to me since I cannot represent the blueness of blue (i.e. I cannot see the color blue). The relationship between these two types of representation can vary.

&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Objective varies, but the subjective does not:  e.g. brain-in-a-vat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subjective varies, but the objective does not:  e.g. color-inverted world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All representations found in objective and none in the subjective:  e.g. thermometer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All representations found in subjective and none in the objective:  e.g. an agent that experiences in a void.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Eliminativists think that subjective representations don't exist. Reductivists think subjective representations are reducible to objective. Non-reductivists think that subjective representations are real and distinct.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3663">'''Meta-systems''' have several definitions. In general, they link the concepts "[[system]]" and "[[meta-]]". A "meta-system" is about other systems, such as describing, generalizing, modelling, or analyzing the other system(s).

According to [[Valentin Turchin|Turchin]] and [[Cliff Joslyn|Joslyn]] (1997), this "natural" systemic definition is not sufficient for their Theory of Meta-system Transition,&lt;ref&gt;[http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/MST.html Metasystem Transition Theory], [[Valentin Turchin]], [[Cliff Joslyn]], 1993-1997&lt;/ref&gt; it also is not equivalent to the definition of ''[[system of systems]]'' in [[Autopoiesis|Autopoietic System]]s Theory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archonic.net Reflexive Autopoietic Systems Theory]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In economics ==
In [[economics]], meta-systems are like what [[Georges Bataille|Bataille]] calls general economies as opposed to the restricted economies of systems.

A book about the difference between general and restricted economies is ''Complementarity'' by [[Arshad Naim]]. In this case "meta" is defined as what is beyond: the meta-system is what lies beyond the system.

==In mathematics, biology and psychology==

In [[mathematics]], [[biology]] and [[psychology]], many variables have occurred within [[structure]]s and systems that [[determined]] the results, discoveries, [[Rate (mathematics)|rates]] and [[Value (mathematics)|value]](s) of [[set (mathematics)|sets]], systems, and developments within systems, structures, systems within structures and sets of structures.

A [[mathematical]]-modelling rule system for a [[Scientific modelling|domain]] D is an example of a meta-system in mathematics and [[science]], for similar and [[consistency]] of concrete or [[frequency]] found in [[computer models|models]] within a domain. 
These are all modes or models; where commonalities are more consistent with consecutive scores or values within a [[range (statistics)|ranged order]] and are good indicators for gauging [[probability|probabilities]], traits (psychology) or properties (biology).

== In cultural studies and sociology ==
Meta-systems in [[cultural studies]] and [[sociology]] refer to contexts, milieux, situations, [[ecosystem]]s, [[natural environment|environments]] and the [[biological process]] with the use of commonalities in behavioral [[Trait theory|trait]]s and human developments found surrounding a [[social]] or [[scientific]] system which the system must interact with in order to remain viable. Meta-systems have different structures and also are complementary to other structures of such systems. Without this complementarity in the [[values]], [[Human bonding|bonding]]s, or [[tact (psychology)|tact]], the systems could not remain productive, viable or operational.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

== In cybernetics==
The term "meta-system" (or "metasystem") in [[cybernetics]] is synonymous with [[management]] [[system]] or [[control system]]. [[Stafford Beer]], who founded [[management cybernetics]] with his [[viable system model]], speaks of metasystems that apply metalanguages which are able to find means of making decisions when necessary improvements cannot be made. In [[computer science]] this is known as the [[halting problem]]. Here metalanguage works in a larger context than the language it describes and has more [[variety (cybernetics)|variety]].

'''Negative affectivity''' ('''NA'''), or '''negative affect''', is a personality variable that involves the experience of negative emotions and poor self-concept.&lt;ref name="Watson &amp; Clark 1984"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Watson | first1 = D. | last2 = Clark | first2 = L.

People who express high negative affectivity view themselves and a variety of aspects of the world around them in generally negative terms.&lt;ref name="Watson &amp; Clark 1984" /&gt; Negative affectivity is strongly related to [[subjective life satisfaction|life satisfaction]]. Individuals high in negative affect will exhibit, on average, higher levels of distress, anxiety, and dissatisfaction, and tend to focus on the unpleasant aspects of themselves, the world, the future, and other people, and also evoke more negative life events.&lt;ref name="Jeronimus2014"/&gt; The similarities between these affective traits and life satisfaction have led some researchers to view both positive and negative affect with life satisfaction as specific indicators of the broader construct of [[subjective well-being]].

Negative affect arousal mechanisms can induce negative affective states as evidenced by a study conducted by Stanley S. Seidner on negative arousal and white noise. The study quantified reactions from Mexican and Puerto Rican participants in response to the devaluation of speakers from other ethnic origins.&lt;ref&gt;Seidner, Stanley S. (1991), Negative Affect Arousal Reactions from Mexican and Puerto Rican Respondents, Washington, D.C.: ERIC, ISBN ED346711 http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED346711&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED346711&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measurement ==
There are many instruments that can be used to measure negative affectivity, including measures of related concepts, such as neuroticism and trait anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Watson | first1 = D. | last2 = Clark | first2 = L. A. | year = 1984 | title = Negative affectivity: The disposition to experience aversive emotional states | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 96 | issue = 3| pages = 465–490 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.96.3.465 | pmid=6393179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two frequently used are:

==Benefits==
Recent studies indicate that negative affect has important, beneficial impacts on cognition and behavior. These developments are a remarkable departure from past psychological research, which is characterized by a unilateral emphasis on the benefits of [[positive affect]].&lt;ref name=Seed&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forgas|first=Joseph|title=Don't Worry, Be Sad! On the Cognitive, Motivational, and Interpersonal Benefits of Negative Mood|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|year=2013|volume=22|issue=3|pages=225–232|doi=10.1177/0963721412474458|url=http://cdp.sagepub.com/content/22/3/225.full.pdf|accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both states of affect influence mental processes and behavior.&lt;ref name=2ndary /&gt; Negative affect is regularly recognized as a "stable, heritable trait tendency to experience a broad range of negative feelings, such as worry, anxiety, self-criticisms, and a negative self-view". This allows one to feel every type of emotion, which is regarded as a normal part of life and human nature. So, while the emotions themselves are viewed as negative, the individual experiencing them should not be classified as a negative person or depressed. They are going through a normal process and are feeling something that many individuals may not be able to feel or process due to differing problems.

These findings complement [[evolutionary psychology]] theories that affective states serve adaptive functions in promoting suitable cognitive strategies to deal with environmental challenges.&lt;ref name=2ndary&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forgas|first=Joseph|title=Cognitive Theories of Affect|journal=Corsini Encyclopedia of Psychology|date=30 January 2010|pages=1–3|doi=10.1002/9780470479216.corpsy2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Positive affect is associated with assimilative, top-down processing used in response to familiar, benign environments. Negative affect is connected with accommodative, bottom-up processing in response to unfamiliar, or problematic environments.&lt;ref name=Bless&amp;Fiedler&gt;{{cite book|last=Forgas|first=Joseph|title=Affect in social thinking and behavior|year=2006|publisher=Psychology Press|location=New York, NY, US|isbn=1-84169-454-1|pages=65–84|author2=Herbert Bless|edition=12|editor1=Klaus Fiedler|editor2=Joseph Forgas|accessdate=4 December 2013|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=psyh&amp;AN=2006-21670-004&amp;site=ehost-live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, positive affectivity promotes simplistic [[heuristic]] approaches that rely on preexisting knowledge and assumptions. Conversely, negative affectivity promotes controlled, analytic approaches that rely on externally drawn information.&lt;ref name=Bless&amp;Fiedler /&gt;

Benefits of negative affect are present in areas of cognition including [[perception]], [[judgment]], [[memory]] and interpersonal personal relations.&lt;ref name=Seed /&gt;&lt;ref name=2ndary /&gt; Since negative affect relies more on cautious processing than preexisting knowledge, people with negative affect tend to perform better in instances involving [[deception]], manipulation, [[impression formation]], and [[stereotyping]]. Negative affectivity's analytical and detailed processing of information leads to fewer reconstructive-memory errors, whereas positive mood relies on broader schematic to thematic information that ignores detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bless, H, Schawarz, N|first=ed. by Shelly Chaiken|title=Dual-process Theories in Social Psychology|year=1999|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=1-57230-421-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, information processing in negative moods reduces the [[misinformation effect]] and increases overall accuracy of details.&lt;ref name=Seed /&gt; People also exhibit less interfering responses to stimuli when given descriptions or performing any [[cognitive]] task.&lt;ref name=Seed&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forgas|first=Joseph|title=Don't Worry, Be Sad! On the Cognitive, Motivational, and Interpersonal Benefits of Negative Mood|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|year=2013|volume=22|issue=3|pages=225–232|doi=10.1177/0963721412474458|url=http://cdp.sagepub.com/content/22/3/225.full.pdf|accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judgment===
People are notoriously susceptible to forming inaccurate judgments based on [[biases]] and limited information. Evolutionary theories propose that negative affective states tend to increase skepticism and decrease reliance on preexisting knowledge.&lt;ref name=Bless&amp;Fiedler /&gt; Consequently, judgmental accuracy is improved in areas such as [[impression formation]], reducing [[fundamental attribution error]], [[stereotyping]], and [[gullibility]].&lt;ref name=Seed /&gt; While sadness is normally associated with the hippocampus, it does not produce the same side effects that would be associated with feelings of pleasure or excitement. Sadness correlates with feeling blue or the creation of tears, while excitement may cause a spike in blood pressure and one's pulse. As far as judgment goes, most people think about how they themselves feel about a certain situation. They will jump right to their current mood when asked a question. However, some mistake this process when using their current mood to justify a reaction to a stimulus. If you're sad, yet only a little bit, chances are your reactions and input will be negative as a whole.

====Impression formation====
First impressions are one of the most basic forms of judgments people make on a daily basis; yet judgment formation is a complex and fallible process. Negative affect is shown to decrease errors in forming impressions based on presuppositions.&lt;ref name=Seed /&gt; One common judgment error is the [[halo effect]], or the tendency to form unfounded impressions of people based on known but irrelevant information.&lt;ref name=Seed /&gt; For instance, more attractive people are often attributed with more positive qualities. Research demonstrates that positive affect tends to increase the halo effect, whereas negative affect decreases it.&lt;ref name="Forgas (2011)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forgas|first=Joseph|title=She just doesn't look like a philosopher…? Affective influences on the halo effect in impression formatio|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|year=2011|volume=41|issue=7|pages=812–817|doi=10.1002/ejsp.842|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=67365761&amp;site=ehost-live|accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study involving undergraduate students demonstrated a halo effect in identifying a middle-aged man as more likely to be a philosopher than an unconventional, young woman.&lt;ref name="Forgas (2011)" /&gt; These halo effects were nearly eliminated when participants were in a negative affective state. In the study, researchers sorted participants into either happy or sad groups using an autobiographical mood induction task in which participants reminisced on sad or happy memories.&lt;ref name="Forgas (2011)" /&gt; Then, participants read a philosophical essay by a fake academic who was identified as either a middle-aged, bespectacled man or as a young, unorthodox-looking woman. The fake writer was evaluated on intelligence and competence. The positive affect group exhibited a strong halo effect, rating the male writer significantly higher than the female writer in competence.&lt;ref name="Forgas (2011)" /&gt; The negative affect group exhibited almost no halo effects rating the two equally. Researchers concluded that impression formation is improved by negative affect.&lt;ref name="Forgas (2011)" /&gt; Their findings support theories that negative affect results in more elaborate processing based upon external, available information.&lt;ref name="Forgas (2011)" /&gt;

====Fundamental attribution error====
The systematic, attentive approach caused by negative affect reduces [[fundamental attribution error]], the tendency to inaccurately attribute behavior to a person's internal character without taking external, situational factors into account.&lt;ref name="Forgas (1998) FAE"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forgas|first=Joseph|title=On being happy and mistaken: Mood effects on the fundamental attribution  error|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1998|volume=75|issue=2|pages=318–331|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.75.2.318|pmid=9731311}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forgas|first=Joseph|title=She just doesn't look like a philosopher…? Affective influences on the halo effect in impression formation|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|year=2011|volume=41|issue=7|pages=812–817|doi=10.1002/ejsp.842}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fundamental attribution error (FAE) is connected with positive affect since it occurs when people use top-down cognitive processing based on inferences. Negative affect stimulates bottom-up, systematic analysis that reduces fundamental attribution error.&lt;ref name="Forgas (1998) FAE" /&gt;

This effect is documented in FAE research in which students evaluated a fake debater on attitude and likability based on an essay the "debater" wrote.&lt;ref name="Forgas (1998) FAE" /&gt; After being sorted into positive or negative affect groups, participants read one of two possible essays arguing for one side or another on a highly controversial topic. Participants were informed that the debater was assigned a stance to take in the essay that did not necessarily reflect his views.&lt;ref name="Forgas (1998) FAE" /&gt;  Still, the positive affect groups rated debaters who argued unpopular views as holding the same attitude expressed in the essay. They were also rated as unlikeable compared to debaters with popular stances, thus, demonstrating FAE. In contrast, the data for the negative affect group displayed no significant difference in ratings for debaters with popular stance and debaters with unpopular stances.&lt;ref name="Forgas (1998) FAE" /&gt; These results indicate that positive affect assimilation styles promote fundamental attribution error, and negative affect accommodation styles minimize the error in respect to judging people.&lt;ref name=Seed /&gt;

====Stereotyping====
Negative affect benefits judgment in diminishing the implicit use of stereotypes by promoting closer attention to stimuli.&lt;ref name=Seed /&gt;  In one study, participants were less likely to discriminate against targets that appeared Muslim when in a negative affective state.&lt;ref name=Unkelbach&gt;{{cite journal|last=Unkelbach|first=Christian|author2=Joseph P. Forgas |author3=Thomas F. Denson |title=The turban effect: The influence of Muslim headgear and induced affect on aggressive responses in the shooter bias paradigm|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|year=2008|volume=44|pages=1409–1413|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2008.04.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; After organizing participants into positive and negative affect groups, researchers had them play a computer game. Participants had to make rapid decisions to shoot only at targets carrying a gun.&lt;ref name=Unkelbach/&gt; Some of the targets wore turbans making them appear Muslim. As expected, there was a significant bias against Muslim targets resulting in a tendency to shoot at them.&lt;ref name=Seed /&gt; However, this tendency decreased with subjects in negative affective states. Positive affect groups developed more aggressive tendencies toward Muslims.&lt;ref name=Unkelbach/&gt; Researchers concluded that negative affect leads to less reliance on internal stereotypes, thus decreasing judgmental bias.&lt;ref name=Seed /&gt;

====Gullibility====
Multiple studies have shown that negative affectivity has a beneficial role in increasing skepticism and decreasing gullibility.&lt;ref name=Seed /&gt; Because negative affective states increase external analysis and attention to details, people in negative states are better able to detect deception.&lt;ref name=Seed /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bless&amp;Fiedler /&gt;

Researchers have presented findings in which students in negative affective states had improved lie detection compared to students in positive affective states.&lt;ref name="Reinhard&amp;Schwarz (2010)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reinhard|first=Marc-André|author2=Norbert Schwarz|title=The Influence of Affective States on the Process of Lie Detection|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied|year=2012|volume=18|issue=4|pages=377–389|doi= 10.1037/a0030466}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study, students watched video clips of everyday people either lying or telling the truth. First, music was used to induce positive, negative, or neutral affect in participants.&lt;ref name="Reinhard&amp;Schwarz (2010)" /&gt; Then, experimenters played 14 video messages that had to be identified by participants as true or false. As expected, the negative affect group performed better in veracity judgments than the positive affect group who performed no better than chance.&lt;ref name="Reinhard&amp;Schwarz (2010)" /&gt; Researchers believe that the negative affect groups detected deception more successfully because they attended to stimulus details and systematically built inferences from those details.&lt;ref name="Reinhard&amp;Schwarz (2010)" /&gt;

===Memory===
Memory has been found to have many [[The Seven Sins of Memory|failures]] that effect the accuracy of recalled memories.&lt;ref name=textbook&gt;{{cite book|last=Robinson-Riegler|first=Bridget Robinson-Riegler, Gregory|title=Cognitive psychology: Applying the Science of the mind|publisher=Pearson Allyn &amp; Bacon|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-205-03364-5|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been especially pragmatic in criminal settings as eyewitness memories have been found to be less reliable than one would hope. However, the externally focused and accommodative processing of negative affect has a positive effect on the overall improvement of memory. This evidenced by reduction of the misinformation effect and the number of false memories reported.&lt;ref name=Seed /&gt; The knowledge implies that negative affect can be used to enhance eyewitness memory;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Joseph P. Forgas |editor2=Klaus Fiedler |editor3=Constantine Sedikides |title=Social thinking and interpersonal behavior|year=2013|publisher=Psychology Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-203-13967-7|pages=221–238|type=PDF|chapter=The upside of feeling down: The benefits of negative mood for social cognition and social behavior}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, additional research suggests that the extent to which memory is improved by negative affect does not sufficiently improve eyewitness testimonies to significantly reduce its error.

====Misinformation effect====
Negative affect has been shown to decrease susceptibility of incorporating misleading information, which is related to the misinformation effect.&lt;ref name=Seed /&gt; The '''misinformation effect''' refers to the finding that misleading information presented between the encoding of an event and its subsequent recall influences a witness's memory.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt; This corresponds to two types of memory failure:
:[[The Seven Sins of Memory|'''Suggestibility''']]: When recollections are influenced by the prodding or expectations of others creating [[Confabulation|false memories]].&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=LaPaglia|first=Jessica A.|author2=Wilford, Miko M. |author3=Rivard, Jillian R. |author4=Chan, Jason C. K. |author5= Fisher, Ronald P. |title=Misleading Suggestions can Alter Later Memory Reports even Following a Cognitive Interview|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|date=October 2013|doi=10.1002/acp.2950 |volume=28 |pages=1–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:[[Misattribution of memory|'''Misattribution''']]: When a witness gets confused and misattributes the misinformation to the original event. Also defined as the retroactive interference: When later information interferes with the ability to retain previously encoded information.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt;

=====In witness of events=====
Negative mood is shown to decrease suggestibility error. This is seen through reduced amounts of incorporation of false memories when misleading information is present. On the other hand, positive affect has shown to increase susceptibility to misleading information. An experiment with undergraduate students supported these results. Participants began the study in a lecture hall and witnessed what they thought was an unexpected five-minute belligerent encounter between an intruder and the lecturer. A week later, these participants watched a 10-minute-long video that generated either a positive, negative or neutral mood. They then completed a brief questionnaire about the previous incident between the intruder and lecturer that they witnessed the week earlier. In this questionnaire half of the participants received questions with misleading information and the other half received questions without any misleading information. This manipulation was used to determine if participants were susceptible to suggestibility failure. After 45 minutes of unrelated distractors participants were given a set of true or false questions which tested for false memories. Participants experiencing negative moods reported fewer numbers of false memories, whereas those experiencing positive moods reported a greater amount of false memories. This implies that positive affect promotes integration of misleading details and negative affect reduces the misinformation effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forgas|first=Joseph P.|author2=Laham, Simon M. |author3=Vargas, Patrick T. |title=Mood effects on eyewitness memory: Affective influences on susceptibility to misinformation|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|date=November 2005|volume=41|issue=6|pages=574–588|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2004.11.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=das&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Weiner|editor-first=Irving B.|title=Handbook of psychology|year=2012|publisher=Wiley|location=Hoboken, N.J.|isbn=9781118133880|edition=2nd |type=Web|chapter=Affective Influences on Cognition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====In recall of past public events=====
People who experience negative affectivity following an event report fewer reconstructive false memories. This was evidenced by two studies conducted around public events. The first surrounded the events of the televised O.J. Simpson trial. Participants were asked to fill out questionnaires three times: one week, two months and a year after the televised verdict. These questionnaires measured participant emotion towards the verdict and the accuracy of their recalled memory of what occurred during the trial. Overall the study found that although participant response to the event outcome did not affect the quantity of remembered information, it did influence the likelihood of false memory. Participants who were pleased with the verdict of the O.J. Simpson trial were more likely to falsely believe something occurred during the trial than those who were displeased with the verdict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levine|first=Linda|author2=Bluck, Susan|title=Painting with broad strokes: Happiness and the malleability of event memory|journal=Cognition &amp; Emotion|date=June 2004|volume=18|issue=4|pages=559–574|doi=10.1080/02699930341000446}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=das2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kensinger|first=Elizabeth A.|title=Negative Emotion Enhances Memory Accuracy: Behavioral and Neuroimaging Evidence|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|date= August 2007|volume=16|issue=4|pages=213–218|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00506.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another experiment found the same findings with Red Sox fans and Yankees fans in their overall memory of events that occurred in the final game of a 2004 playoff series in which the Red Sox defeated the Yankees.&lt;ref name=das2 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kensinger|first=Elizabeth A.|author2=Schacter, Daniel L.|title=When the Red Sox shocked the Yankees: Comparing negative and positive memories|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review|date=October 2006|volume=13|issue=5|pages=757–763|doi=10.3758/BF03193993}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that the Yankees fans had better memory of events that occurred than the Red Sox fans. The results from both of these experiments are consistent with the findings that negative emotion can lead to fewer memory errors and thus increased memory accuracy of events.&lt;ref name=das2 /&gt;

====Degree of enhanced memory====
Although negative affect has been shown to decrease the misinformation effect, the degree to which memory is improved is not enough to make a significant effect on witness testimony. In fact, emotions, including negative affect, are shown to reduce accuracy in identifying perpetrators from photographic lineups. Researchers demonstrated this effect in an experiment in which participants watched a video that induced either negative emotion or a neutral mood. The two videos were deliberately similar except for the action of interest, which was either a mugging (negative emotion) or a conversation (neutral emotion). After watching one of the two videos participants are shown perpetrator lineups, which either contained the target perpetrator from the video or a foil, a person that looked similar to the target. The results revealed that the participants who watched the emotion-induced video were more likely to incorrectly identify the innocent foil than to correctly identify the perpetrator. Neutral participants were more likely to correctly identify the perpetrator in comparison to their emotional counterparts. This demonstrates that emotional affect in forensic settings decreases accuracy of eyewitness memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Houston|first=Kate A.|author2=Clifford, Brian R. |author3=Phillips, Louise H. |author4= Memon, Amina |title=The emotional eyewitness: The effects of emotion on specific aspects of eyewitness recall and recognition performance.|journal=Emotion|year=2013|volume=13|issue=1|pages=118–128|doi=10.1037/a0029220}}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings are consistent with prior knowledge that stress and emotion greatly impair eyewitness ability to recognitive perpetrators.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt;

===Interpersonal benefits===
Negative affectivity can produce several interpersonal benefits. It can cause subjects to be more polite and considerate with others. Unlike positive mood, which causes less assertive approaches, negative affectivity can, in many ways, cause a person to be more polite and elaborate when making requests.&lt;ref name=Seed /&gt;

Negative affectivity increases the accuracy of social perceptions and inferences. Specifically, high negative-affectivity people have more negative, but accurate, perceptions of the impression they make to others. People with low negative affectivity form overly-positive, potentially inaccurate impression of others that can lead to misplaced trust.&lt;ref name=per&gt;{{cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Jennifer D.|author2=Fehr, Beverley|title=Self-esteem and perceptions of conveyed impressions: Is negative affectivity associated with greater realism?|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1990|volume=58|issue=1|pages=122–133|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.58.1.122|pmid=2308069}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Intergroup discrimination====
A research conducted by Forgas J.P studied how affectivity can influence intergroup discrimination. He measured affectivity by how people allocate rewards to [[in-group]] and [[Ingroups and outgroups|out-group]] members. In the procedure, participants had to describe their interpretations after looking at patterns of judgments about people. Afterwards, participants were exposed to a mood induction process, where they had to watch videotapes designed to elicit negative or positive affectivity. Results showed that participants with positive affectivity were more negative and discriminated more than participants with negative affectivity. Also, happy participants were more likely to discriminate between in-group and out-group members than sad participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forgas|first=Joseph P.|author2=Fiedler, Klaus|title=Us and them: Mood effects on intergroup discrimination.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1996|volume=70|issue=1|pages=28–40|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.70.1.28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negative affect is often associated with team selection. It is viewed as a trait that could make selecting individuals for a team irrelevant, thus preventing knowledge from becoming known or predicted for current issues that may arise.

====Communication====
Negative affectivity subconsciously signals a challenging social environment.
Negative mood may increase a tendency to conform to social norms.&lt;ref name="Watson &amp; Clark 1984"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Watson | first1 = D. | last2 = Clark | first2 = L. A. | year = 1984 | title = Negative affectivity: The disposition to experience negative aversive emotional states | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 96 | issue = | pages = 465–490 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.96.3.465 | pmid=6393179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study, college students where exposed to a mood induction process. After the mood induction process, participants were required to watch a show with positive and negative elements. After watching the show, they were asked to engage on a hypothetical conversation in which they "describe the episode (they) just observed to a friend". Their speech was recorded and transcribed during this task. Results showed that speakers in a negative mood had a better quality descriptions and greater amount of  information and details. These results show that negative mood can improve people's communication skills.&lt;ref name=com&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koch|first=Alex S.|author2=Forgas, Joseph P. |author3=Matovic, Diana |title=Can negative mood improve your conversation? Affective influences on conforming to Grice's communication norms|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|date=August 2013|volume=43|issue=5|pages=326–334|doi=10.1002/ejsp.1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A negative mood is closely linked to better conversation because it makes use of the hippocampus and different regions of the brain.{{cn|date=October 2018}} When someone is upset, that individual may see or hear things differently than an individual who is very upbeat and happy all the time. The small details the negative individual picks up may be something completely overlooked before. Anxiety disorders are often associated with over-thinking and ruminating on topics that would seem irrelevant and pointless to an individual without a disorder. [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder|OCD]] is one common anxiety trait that allows the affected individual a different insight on how things may appear to be. A person that makes use of his or her negative affect has a different view of the world and what goes on in it, thus making their conversations different and interesting to others.

====Self-disclosure====
Results of one study show that participants with negative affectivity were more careful with the information they shared with others, being more cautious with who they could trust or not. Researchers found that negative mood not only decreases intimacy levels but also increases caution in placing trust in others.&lt;ref name=self&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forgas|first=Joseph P.|title=Affective influences on self-disclosure: Mood effects on the intimacy and reciprocity of disclosing personal information.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2011|volume=100|issue=3|pages=449–461|doi=10.1037/a0021129|pmid=21171788}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Political campaigning}}

'''Negative campaigning''' or '''mudslinging''' is the process of deliberate spreading negative information about someone or something to worsen the [[public relations|public image]] of the described.

Deliberate spreading of such information can be motivated either by honest desire of the campaigner to warn others against real dangers or deficiencies of the described, or by the campaigner's dishonest ideas on methods of  winning in political, business or other spheres of competition against an honest rival.

The public image of an entity can be defined as [[reputation]], esteem, [[respect]], acceptance of the entity's appearance, [[values]] and behaviour by the general public of a given territory and/or a [[social group]], possibly within time limits. As target groups of public and their values differ, so negativity or positivity of a public image is relative: e.g. while in most societies having an honest source of income is a positive value and stealing is discouraged,  in the world of professional thieves honest work is frowned upon and stealing is encouraged. In [[polygamous]] societies [[monogamy]] is not viewed in the way it is valued in monogamous societies. Values of a society also change with time: e.g. homosexuality in [[Western culture]] was considered immoral and was [[Homosexuality#Legality|criminally prosecuted]] until the [[sexual revolution]] of the second half of the 20 century.
Thus negative campaigning to be successful has to take into account current values of the group it addresses. The degree of strictness in practicing the group's values as opposed to its tolerance for violating the norms has also to be taken into consideration: e.g. while in the [[Old Testament]] and other traditional religious societies [[adultery]] and [[prostitution]] were outlawed and supposed to be punished by death, modern Western societies show much greater tolerance to these.

In [[United States politics]], negative campaigning has been called "as [[American way of life|American]] as Mississippi mud" and "as American as apple pie".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The modern presidential campaign: Mudslinging, bombast, and the vitality of American politics|last = Scher|first = R. K.|publisher = M. E. Sharpe|year = 1997|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some research suggests negative campaigning is the norm in all political venues, mitigated only by the dynamics of a particular contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/politics/seminars/russian5.pdf|title=The Rational Attacker in Russia? Negative Campaigning in Russian Presidential Elections|doi=10.1111/1468-2508.00117|jstor=2691664|author1=Lee Sigelman|author2=Eric Shiraev|journal=The Journal of Politics|year=2002|volume=64|issue=1|pages=45–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Techniques ==

There are a number of techniques used in negative campaigning.  Among the most effective is running [[advertisement]]s attacking an opponent's personality, record, or opinion.  There are two main types of ads used in negative campaigning: attack and contrast.

Attack ads focus exclusively on the negative aspects of the opponent.  There is no positive content in an attack ad, whether it is about the candidate or the opponent.  Attack ads usually identify the risks associated with the opponent, often exploiting people’s fears to manipulate and lower the impression voters have of the opponent.  Because attack ads have no positive content, they have the potential to be more influential than contrast ads in shaping voters’ views of the sponsoring candidate’s opponent.&lt;ref name="Fridkin &amp; Kenney, 2004"&gt;Fridkin, K. L., &amp; Kenney, P. J. (2004). Do Negative Messages Work?: The Impact of Negativity on Citizens’ Evaluations of Candidates. American Politics Research, 32(570), 570–602. {{doi|10.1177/1532673X03260834}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike attack ads, contrast ads contain information about both the candidate and the opponent.  The information about the candidate is positive, while the information about the opponent is negative.  Contrast ads compare and contrast the candidate with the opponent, juxtaposing the positive information about the candidate with the negative information of the opponent.  Because contrast ads must contain positive information, contrast ads are seen as less damaging to the political process than attack ads.&lt;ref name="Fridkin &amp; Kenney, 2004"/&gt;

One of the most famous such ads was ''[[Daisy (television commercial)|Daisy Girl]]'' by the campaign of [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] that successfully portrayed Republican [[Barry Goldwater]] as threatening [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]]. Common negative campaign techniques include painting an opponent as soft on criminals, dishonest, corrupt, or a danger to the nation. One common negative campaigning tactic is attacking the other side for running a negative campaign.

Dirty tricks are also common in negative political campaigns. These generally involve secretly leaking damaging information to the media. This isolates a candidate from backlash and also does not cost any money. The material must be substantive enough to attract media interest, however, and if the truth is discovered it could severely damage a campaign. Other dirty tricks include trying to feed an opponent's team false information hoping they will use it and embarrass themselves.

Often a campaign will use outside organizations, such as [[lobbying|lobby groups]], to launch attacks. These can be claimed to be coming from a neutral source and if the allegations turn out not to be true the attacking candidate will not be damaged if the links cannot be proven. Negative campaigning can be conducted by proxy. For instance, highly partisan ads were placed in the [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004 U.S. presidential election]] by allegedly independent bodies like [[MoveOn.org]] and [[Swift Boat Veterans for Truth]].

[[Push poll]]s are attacks disguised as [[Robo call#Political calls|telephone polls]]. They might ask a question like "How would you react if Candidate A was revealed to beat his wife?", giving the impression that Candidate A might beat his wife. Members of the media and of the opposing party are deliberately not called making these tactics all but invisible and unprovable.

[[G. Gordon Liddy]] played a major role in developing these tactics during the [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] campaign playing an important advisory of rules that led to the [[campaign of 1972]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} [[James Carville]], campaign manager of [[Bill Clinton]]'s 1992 election, is also a major proponent of negative tactics.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} [[Lee Atwater]], best known for being an advisor to presidents [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George H.W. Bush]], also pioneered many negative campaign techniques seen in political campaigns today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/20/opinion/20sat3.html | work=The New York Times | title=The Political Legacy of Baaad Boy Atwater | first=Eleanor | last=Randolph | date=September 20, 2008 | accessdate=May 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages ==

Sponsors of overt negative campaigns often cite reasons to support [[mass communication]] of negative ideas. The [[Office of National Drug Control Policy]] uses negative campaigns to steer the public away from health risks. Similar negative campaigns have been used to rebut mass marketing by [[tobacco companies]], or to discourage [[drunk driving]]. Those who conduct negative political campaigns sometimes say the public needs to know about the person he or she is voting for, even if it is bad. In other words, if a candidate’s opponent is a crook or a bad person, then he or she should be able to tell the public about it.

[[Martin Wattenberg (political scientist)|Martin Wattenberg]] and [[Craig Brians]], of the University of California, Irvine, considered in their study whether negative campaigning mobilizes or alienates voters. They concluded that data used by [[Stephen Ansolabehere]] in a 1994 American Political Science Review article to advance the hypothesis that negative campaigning demobilizes voters was flawed.

A subsequent study done by Ansolabehere and [[Shanto Iyengar]] in 1995&lt;ref name="Ansolabehere, S. 1995"&gt;Ansolabehere, S. &amp; Iyengar, S. (1995). Going negative: How campaign advertising shrinks and polarizes the electorate. New York: The Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; corrected some of the previous study's flaws. This study concluded that negative advertising suppressed voter turnout, particularly for Independent voters. They speculated that campaigns tend to go negative only if the Independent vote is leaning toward the opponent. In doing so, they insure that the swing voters stay home, leaving the election up to base voters. They also found that negative ads have a greater impact on Democrats than on Republicans. According to them, base Republicans will vote no matter what (and will vote only for a Republican), but Democrats can be influenced to either stay home and not vote at all or to switch sides and vote for a Republican. This, combined with the effect negativity has on Independents, led them to conclude that Republicans benefit more from going negative than Democrats.

Other researchers have found different, more positive outcomes from negative campaigns. [[Rick Farmer]], PhD, an assistant professor of political science at the [[University of Akron]] found that negative ads are more memorable than positive ads when they reinforce a preexisting belief and are relevant to the central issues of a marketing campaign. Researchers at the [[University of Georgia]] found the impact of negative ads increases over time, while positive ads used to counteract negative ads lack the power of negative ads&amp;nbsp;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0DTI/is_11_32/ai_n8569068 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050622031838/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0DTI/is_11_32/ai_n8569068 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2005-06-22 |title=Sock it to 'em: can a negative marketing campaign have positive results? Here's what to know before you strike the first blow &amp;#124; Entrepreneur &amp;#124; Find Articles at BNET |publisher=Findarticles.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-15 |year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research also suggests negative campaigning introduces controversy and raises public awareness through additional news coverage&amp;nbsp;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economics.ucr.edu/news/SWET/Garrett_Asay.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060323181046/http://www.economics.ucr.edu/news/SWET/Garrett_Asay.pdf |date=March 23, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most recently, [[Kyle Mattes]] and [[David P. Redlawsk]] in ''The Positive Case for Negative Campaigning'' show through surveys and experiments that negative campaigning provides informational benefits for voters. Without negativity, voters would not have full information about all of their choices, since no candidate will say anything bad about herself. They argue that candidates have to point out the flaws in their opponents for voters to be fully informed.

== Risks and consequences ==
Some strategists say that an effect of negative campaigning is that while it motivates the base of support it can alienate centrist and undecided voters from the political process, reducing [[voter turnout]] and radicalizing politics.&lt;ref name="Ansolabehere, S. 1995"/&gt; 
In a study done by Gina Garramone about how negative advertising affects the political process, it was found that a consequence of negative campaigning is greater image discrimination of the candidates and greater attitude polarization.  While positive ads also contributed to the image discrimination and attitude polarization, Garramone found that negative campaigning played a more influential role in the discrimination and polarization than positive campaigning.&lt;ref name="Garramone 1990"&gt;Garramone, G. M., Atkin, C. K., Pinkleton, B. E., &amp; Cole, R. T. (1990, Summer). Effects of Negative Political Advertising on the Political Process. Journal of Broadcasting and Electronic Media, 34(3), 299–311. {{doi|10.1080/08838159009386744}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Negative ads can produce a backlash. A [[1993 Chrétien attack ad|disastrous ad]] was run by the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada]] in the [[Canadian federal election, 1993|1993 Canadian federal election]], apparently emphasizing [[Liberal Party of Canada]] leader [[Jean Chrétien]]'s [[Bell's Palsy]] partial facial paralysis in a number of unflattering photos, with the subtext of criticizing his platforms. Chrétien took maximum advantage of the opportunity to gain the public's sympathy as a man who struggled with a physical disability and his party's subsequent overwhelming victory in the election helped reduce the governing Conservatives to two seats.

A similar backlash happened to the Liberal Party in the [[Canadian federal election, 2006|2006 federal election]] for running an [[2006 Liberal Party of Canada election ads|attack ad]] that suggested that [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] leader [[Stephen Harper]] would use Canadian soldiers to patrol Canadian cities, and impose some kind of martial law. The ad was only available from the Liberal Party's web site for a few hours prior to the release of the attack ads on television; nevertheless, it was picked up by the media and widely criticized for its absurdity, in particular the sentence "we're not making this up; we're not allowed to make this stuff up". Liberal MP Keith Martin expressed his disapproval of "whoever the idiot who approved that ad was," shortly before Liberal leader Paul Martin (no relation) stated that he had personally approved them. The effect of the ads was to diminish the credibility of the party's other attack ads. It offended many Canadians, particularly those in the military, some of whom were fighting in [[Afghanistan]] at the time.  (See [[Canadian federal election, 2006]])

More recently, in the 2008 US Senate race in [[North Carolina]], Republican incumbent [[Elizabeth Dole]] attempted an attack ad on Democratic challenger [[Kay Hagan]], who had taken a small lead in polls, by tying her to [[atheists]]. Dole's campaign released an ad questioning Hagan's religion and it included a voice saying "There is no God!" over a picture of Kay Hagan's face. The voice was not Hagan's but it is believed the ad implied that it was. Initially, it was thought the ad would work as religion has historically been a very important issue to voters in the American south, but the ad produced a backlash across the state and Hagan responded forcefully with an ad saying that she was a Sunday school teacher and was a religious person. Hagan also claimed Dole was trying to change the subject from the economy (the ad appeared around the same time as the [[2008 financial crisis]]). Hagan's lead in polls doubled and she won the race by a nine-point margin.

Because of the possible harm that can come from being seen as a negative campaigner, candidates often pledge to refrain from negative attacks. This pledge is usually abandoned when an opponent is perceived to be "going negative," with the first retaliatory attack being, ironically, an accusation that the opponent is a negative campaigner.

While some research has found advantages and other has found disadvantages, some studies find no difference between negative and positive approaches&amp;nbsp;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://americandemocracy.nd.edu/working_papers/documents/Arceneaux_Nickerson_Negative_Messages.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325013318/http://americandemocracy.nd.edu/working_papers/documents/Arceneaux_Nickerson_Negative_Messages.pdf |date=March 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research published in the Journal of Advertising found that negative political advertising makes the body want to turn away physically, but the mind remembers negative messages. The findings are based on research conducted by James Angelini, professor of communication at the [[University of Delaware]], in collaboration with Samuel Bradley, assistant professor of advertising at [[Texas Tech University]], and Sungkyoung Lee of [[Indiana University]], which used ads that aired during the 2000 presidential election. During the study, the researchers placed electrodes under the eyes of willing participants and showed them a series of 30-second ads from both the [[George W. Bush]] and [[Al Gore]] campaigns. The electrodes picked up on the "startle response," the automatic eye movement typically seen in response to snakes, spiders and other threats. Compared to positive or neutral messages, negative advertising prompted greater reflex reactions and a desire to move away.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newswise.com/articles/view/545187/ Viewers Are Repulsed by Negative Campaign Ads] Newswise, Retrieved on October 9, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The advertisement caught the attention of [[:sr:Регулаторно_тело_за_електронске_медије|REM]], which resulted in a suspend of the advertisement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rts.rs/page/stories/sr/story/2728/izbori-2018/3042256/rem-obustaviti-emitovanje-spota-liste-aleksandar-vucic--zato-sto-volimo-beograd.html|title=REM: Obustaviti emitovanje spota liste "Aleksandar Vučić – Zato što volimo Beograd"|last=Serbia|first=RTS, Radio televizija Srbije, Radio Television of|access-date=2018-02-18|language=sr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6961">The '''negative double''' is a form of [[takeout double]] in [[Contract bridge|bridge]]. It is made by the responder after his right-hand opponent [[overcall]]s on the first round of bidding, and is used to show both support for the unbid suits as well as some values. It is treated as forcing, but not unconditionally so. In practice, the negative double is sometimes used as a sort of catch-all, made when no other call properly describes responder's hand. Therefore, a partnership might even treat the negative double as a wide-ranging call that merely shows some values.

==Usage==

Using the modern negative double convention, it is understood that a double over an initial overcall is conventional, and ''not'' for penalties (but see [[#Playing for penalties|Playing for penalties]]). For example, using this convention, the following doubles would be regarded as negative, not for penalty:

*1{{Clubs}} – (1{{Diams}}) – Dbl
*1m – (1M) – Dbl
*1{{Hearts}} – (1{{Spades}}) – Dbl
*1M – (2m) – Dbl

In understandings regarding negative doubles, the emphasis is on major suit lengths. This is largely due to the special value that tournament play, especially the pairs game, places on major suits. Since the mid-1980s, the negative double has been used mainly to stand in for a bid in an unbid major suit.

Most partnerships using the negative double agree that it applies only through a particular level of overcall. For example, they may agree that the double of an overcall through 3{{Spades}} is negative, and that beyond 3{{Spades}} a double is for penalties.

At [[rubber bridge]] many players are reluctant to give up the penalty double of an overcall, and so do not use the double as conventional.

==History of terms used for this bid==

The term ''negative double'' was initially employed to distinguish it from the ''penalty'', or ''business'', or ''positive'' double, and signified a double over an opponent's opening bid whose meaning was a request for partner to bid his best suit. Around 1930, the term ''informatory double'' replaced ''negative double'', and that term later gave way to ''[[takeout double]]'' as it is used at present; the original term ''negative double'' fell into disuse.

In 1957, [[Alvin Roth (bridge)|Alvin Roth]] in his partnership with [[Tobias Stone]] appropriated the abandoned term ''negative double'' to denote a conventional double by responder over an overcall and gave it its current meaning.&lt;ref name=OEB7303&gt;{{OEB|7|303}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bid was also briefly known as ''Sputnik'', because it was as new as the [[Sputnik|satellite of that name]] that the Soviet Union had recently launched. The term is still used sometimes in Europe.&lt;ref name =OEB7303/&gt;

==Forcing==

The negative double is generally [[forcing bid|forcing]], but opener might pass to convert the double to a penalty double. There is a special agreement called [[negative free bid]]s, under which (after the overcall) the bid of a new suit by responder is not forcing. However, most negative doublers play that a new suit response (or [[Contract bridge glossary#F|free bid]]), whether at the one level or higher, is forcing.

The negative double loses even more definition when it can be made with a very broad range of strength, from roughly six HCP up to game forcing values. In a pinch, players use it to "get by this round of bidding."

==Playing for penalties==

The negative double does not cause the partnership to completely lose the ability to penalize an overcall. There are two ways that the overcall can be doubled for penalties. For example:

*1{{Diams}} – (1{{Hearts}}) – Dbl  – (Pass); '''Pass'''

Responder makes a negative double, and opener passes for penalties. This position is analogous to one in which a player makes a takeout double and his partner passes the double, converting it to a penalty double.

*1{{Diams}} – (1{{Hearts}}) – Pass – (Pass); Dbl – (Pass) – '''Pass'''

Responder passes the overcall, opener makes a re-opening double, and responder passes that double for penalties. This can be dangerous, because opener often doesn't know whether responder is simply too weak to make any call, or is hoping that opener can re-open with a double.

These situations are rare, though, and the more so because some five-card major partnerships play negative doubles ''over minor suit openings only.'' The rationale is that responder knows much more about opener's distribution after a major suit opening than after a minor suit opening, and can better judge whether to play in opener's major suit, to play for penalties by doubling, or to show a suit of his own.

==Support for unbid suits==

Partnerships have different understandings about the length in unbid suits that is shown by a negative double, and the understandings differ according both to which suits remain unbid and to the current level of the bidding. Nevertheless, the following are popular understandings:

*After 1{{Clubs}} – (1{{Diams}}),  a negative double is often understood to show at least four cards in both hearts and spades. The degree of support for this agreement has grown over the years. A poll of experts taken in 1983&lt;ref&gt;[[Bridge World Standard]] BWS84 poll results in [[The Bridge World]], July 1984, 17-22.&lt;/ref&gt; showed that about half concurred that doubler should have at least four hearts and at least four spades; a similar poll taken in 2000&lt;ref name="BWS2001 poll results"&gt;[http://www.bridgeworld.com/default.asp?d=bw_standard&amp;f=bwspolls.html BWS2001 poll results]&lt;/ref&gt; showed 80% in concurrence.
*After 1m – (1{{Hearts}}), a popular agreement is that a negative double shows exactly four spades. Responder would bid 1{{Spades}} with five or more. However, in 2000, this approach was favored by fewer than two thirds of polled experts.&lt;ref name="BWS2001 poll results"/&gt;
*After 1m – (1{{Spades}}), in contrast to the prior sequence, most experts prefer the negative double here to show at ''least'' four hearts – not ''exactly'' four hearts.
*After 1M – (2m), most play that a negative double shows at least four cards in the other major.
*After 1{{Diams}} – (2{{Clubs}}), few play that double shows at least four cards in ''each'' major, but most play that doubler shows at least one major at least four cards long.
*After 1{{Hearts}} - (1{{Spades}}) or 1{{Spades}} - (2{{Hearts}}), the negative double shows at least 4 cards in each minor because there are no unbid major suits.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2939">'''Negative free bid''' is a [[contract bridge]] [[Glossary of contract bridge terms#treatment|treatment]] whereby a [[Glossary of contract bridge terms#freebid|free bid]] by responder over an opponent's overcall shows a long suit in a weak hand and is not forcing. This is in contrast with standard treatment, where a free bid can show unlimited values and is unconditionally forcing. The treatment is a relatively recent invention, and has become quite popular, especially in expert circles.

Negative free bids resolve relatively frequent situations where the responder holds a long suit with which he would like to compete for a partscore, but is deprived from bidding it by opponent's overcall.

==Example==
{| class="wikitable" style="float:left; margin-right:10px;"
!width="25%"|West||width="25%"|North||width="25%"|East||width="25%"|South
|- align=center
|||1{{diams}}||1{{spades}}||?
|} 
For example, if South holds:&amp;nbsp;{{BridgeHandInline|86|KJ10852|K6|532}}, partner opens 1{{Diams}} and East overcalls 1{{Spades}}, he couldn't bid 2{{Hearts}} in standard methods, as it would show 10+ [[Hand evaluation|high-card points]], and a [[negative double]] would be too off-shape. With NFB treatment in effect though, he can bid 2{{Hearts}} which the partner may pass (unless he has extra values and support, or an excellent suit of its own without tolerance for hearts).
{{clear}}
However, as a [[corollary]], negative free bids affect the scope of negative double; if the hand is suitable for "standard" forcing free bid (10-11+ points), a negative double has to be made first and the suit bid only in the next round. Thus, the negative double can be made with the following types of hand:
*A weakish hand with unbid suits (unbid major)
*A stronger hand with unbid suits
*A strong (opening bid or more) one-suited hand.
This can sometimes allow the opponents to [[preempt]] effectively. 
{| class="wikitable" style="float:left; margin-right:10px;"
!width="25%"|West||width="25%"|North||width="25%"|East||width="25%"|South
|- align=center
|1{{Diams}}||1{{Hearts}}||Dbl||4{{Hearts}}
|- align=center
|?|| || ||
|} 
For example, West, holding: {{BridgeHandInline|KJ103|J8|AKQ104|J2}}, after this auction is in an awkward situation — he doesn't know whether partner has spades or not; whether South was bidding to make or to [[sacrifice (bridge)|sacrifice]] — is it correct to double, bid 4{{Spades}} or pass?

'''Negative luminescence''' is a physical phenomenon by which an electronic device emits less [[thermal radiation]] when an [[electric current]] is passed through it than it does in [[thermal equilibrium]] (current off). When viewed by a [[thermal camera]], an operating negative luminescent device looks colder than its environment.

== Physics ==
Negative luminescence is most readily observed in [[semiconductor]]s. Incoming [[infrared]] radiation is absorbed in the material by the creation of an [[electron–hole pair]]. An [[electric field]] is used to remove the electrons and holes from the region before they have a chance to recombine and re-emit thermal radiation. This effect occurs most efficiently in regions of low charge carrier density.

Negative luminescence has also been observed in semiconductors in orthogonal electric and magnetic fields. In this case, the junction of a diode is not necessary and the effect can be observed in bulk material. A term that has been applied to this type of negative luminescence is ''galvanomagnetic luminescence''.

Negative luminescence might appear to be a violation of [[Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation]]. This is not true, as the law only applies in [[thermal equilibrium]].

Another term that has been used to describe negative luminescent devices is "[[Emissivity]] switch", as an electric current changes the effective emissivity.

== History ==
This effect was first seen by Russian physicists in the 1960s in A.F.Ioffe Physicotechnical Institute, Leningrad, Russia. Subsequently, it was studied in [[semiconductors]] such as [[indium antimonide]] (InSb), [[germanium]] (Ge) and [[indium arsenide]] (InAs) by workers in [[West Germany]], [[Ukraine]] (Institute of Semiconductor Physics, [[Kiev]]), Japan ([[Chiba University]]) and the United States. It was first observed in the mid-infrared (3-5 [[µm]] [[wavelength]]) in the more convenient [[diode]] structures in InSb [[heterostructure]] diodes by workers at the [[Defence Research Agency]], [[Great Malvern]], [[United Kingdom|UK]] (now [[QinetiQ]]). These British workers later demonstrated LWIR band (8-12&amp;nbsp;µm) negative luminescence using [[HgCdTe|mercury cadmium telluride]] [[diode]]s.

Later the [[Naval Research Laboratory]], [[Washington DC]], started work on negative luminescence in [[mercury cadmium telluride]] (HgCdTe). The phenomenon has since been observed by several university groups around the world.

In [[information theory]] and [[statistics]], '''negentropy''' is used as a measure of distance to normality.  The concept and phrase "negative entropy" was introduced by [[Erwin Schrödinger]] in his 1944 popular-science book ''[[What is Life? (Schrödinger)|What is Life?]]''&lt;ref&gt;Schrödinger, Erwin, ''What is Life – the Physical Aspect of the Living Cell'', Cambridge University Press, 1944&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[Léon Brillouin]] shortened the phrase to ''negentropy'',&lt;ref&gt;Brillouin, Leon: (1953) "Negentropy Principle of Information", ''J. of Applied Physics'', v. '''24(9)''', pp. 1152–1163&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Léon Brillouin, ''La science et la théorie de l'information'', Masson, 1959&lt;/ref&gt; to express it in a more "positive" way: a living system imports negentropy and stores it.&lt;ref&gt;Mae-Wan Ho, [http://www.i-sis.org.uk/negentr.php What is (Schrödinger's) Negentropy?], Bioelectrodynamics Laboratory, Open university Walton Hall, Milton Keynes&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, [[Albert Szent-Györgyi]] proposed replacing the term ''negentropy'' with ''syntropy''. That term may have originated in the 1940s with the Italian mathematician [[Luigi Fantappiè]], who tried to construct a unified theory of [[biology]] and [[physics]]. [[Buckminster Fuller]] tried to popularize this usage, but ''negentropy'' remains common.

In a note to ''[[What is Life?]]'' Schrödinger explained his use of this phrase.
{{cquote|[...] if I had been catering for them [physicists] alone I should have let the discussion turn on ''[[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]]'' instead. It is the more familiar notion in this context. But this highly technical term seemed linguistically too near to ''[[energy]]'' for making the average reader alive to the contrast between the two things.}}

In 2009, Mahulikar &amp; Herwig redefined negentropy of a dynamically ordered sub-system as the specific entropy deficit of the ordered sub-system relative to its surrounding chaos.&lt;ref&gt;Mahulikar, S.P. &amp; Herwig, H.: (2009) "Exact thermodynamic principles for dynamic order existence and evolution in chaos", ''Chaos, Solitons &amp; Fractals'', v. '''41(4)''', pp. 1939–1948&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, negentropy has SI units of (J kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) when defined based on specific entropy per unit mass, and (K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) when defined based on specific entropy per unit energy. This definition enabled: ''i'') scale-invariant thermodynamic representation of dynamic order existence, ''ii'') formulation of physical principles exclusively for dynamic order existence and evolution, and ''iii'') mathematical interpretation of Schrödinger's negentropy debt.

==Information theory==
In [[information theory]] and [[statistics]], negentropy is used as a measure of distance to normality.&lt;ref&gt;Aapo Hyvärinen, [http://www.cis.hut.fi/aapo/papers/NCS99web/node32.html Survey on Independent Component Analysis, node32: Negentropy], Helsinki University of Technology Laboratory of Computer and Information Science&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aapo Hyvärinen and Erkki Oja, [http://www.cis.hut.fi/aapo/papers/IJCNN99_tutorialweb/node14.html Independent Component Analysis: A Tutorial, node14: Negentropy], Helsinki University of Technology Laboratory of Computer and Information Science&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruye Wang, [http://fourier.eng.hmc.edu/e161/lectures/ica/node4.html Independent Component Analysis, node4: Measures of Non-Gaussianity]&lt;/ref&gt; Out of all [[Distribution (mathematics)|distributions]] with a given mean and variance, the normal or [[Gaussian distribution]] is the one with the highest entropy. Negentropy measures the difference in entropy between a given distribution and the Gaussian distribution with the same mean and variance. Thus, negentropy is always nonnegative, is invariant by any linear invertible change of coordinates, and vanishes [[if and only if]] the signal is Gaussian.

Negentropy is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;J(p_x) = S(\varphi_x) - S(p_x)\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;S(\varphi_x)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[differential entropy]] of the Gaussian density with the same [[mean]] and [[variance]] as &lt;math&gt;p_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S(p_x)&lt;/math&gt; is the differential entropy of &lt;math&gt;p_x&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;S(p_x) = - \int p_x(u) \log p_x(u) \, du&lt;/math&gt;

Negentropy is used in [[statistics]] and [[signal processing]]. It is related to network [[Information entropy|entropy]], which is used in [[independent component analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;P. Comon, Independent Component Analysis – a new concept?, ''Signal Processing'', '''36''' 287–314, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Didier G. Leibovici and Christian Beckmann, [http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/analysis/techrep/tr01dl1/tr01dl1/tr01dl1.html An introduction to Multiway Methods for Multi-Subject fMRI experiment], FMRIB Technical Report 2001, Oxford Centre for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain (FMRIB), Department of Clinical Neurology, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Headley Way, Headington, Oxford, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Correlation between statistical negentropy and Gibbs' free energy==
[[File:Wykres Gibbsa.svg|275px|thumb|right|[[Willard Gibbs]]’ 1873 '''available energy''' ([[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]]) graph, which shows a plane perpendicular to the axis of ''v'' ([[volume]]) and passing through point A, which represents the initial state of the body. MN is the section of the surface of [[dissipated energy]]. Qε and Qη are sections of the planes ''η'' = 0 and ''ε'' = 0, and therefore parallel to the axes of ε ([[internal energy]]) and η ([[entropy]]) respectively. AD and AE are the energy and entropy of the body in its initial state, AB and AC its ''available energy'' ([[Gibbs energy]]) and its ''capacity for entropy'' (the amount by which the entropy of the body can be increased without changing the energy of the body or increasing its volume) respectively.]]
There is a physical quantity closely linked to [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] ([[free enthalpy]]), with a unit of entropy and isomorphic to negentropy known in statistics and information theory. In 1873, [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|Willard Gibbs]] created a diagram illustrating the concept of free energy corresponding to [[free enthalpy]]. On the diagram one can see the quantity called [[capacity for entropy]]. This quantity is the amount of entropy that may be increased without changing an internal energy or increasing its volume.&lt;ref&gt;Willard Gibbs, [http://www.ufn.ru/ufn39/ufn39_4/Russian/r394b.pdf A Method of Geometrical Representation of the Thermodynamic Properties of Substances by Means of Surfaces], ''Transactions of the Connecticut Academy'', 382–404 (1873)&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, it is a difference between maximum possible, under assumed conditions, entropy and its actual entropy. It corresponds exactly to the definition of negentropy adopted in statistics and information theory. A similar physical quantity was introduced in 1869 by [[François Jacques Dominique Massieu|Massieu]] for the [[isothermal process]]&lt;ref&gt;Massieu, M. F. (1869a). Sur les fonctions caractéristiques des divers fluides. ''C. R. Acad. Sci.'' LXIX:858–862.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Massieu, M. F. (1869b). Addition au precedent memoire sur les fonctions caractéristiques. ''C. R. Acad. Sci.'' LXIX:1057–1061.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Massieu, M. F. (1869), ''Compt. Rend.'' '''69''' (858): 1057.&lt;/ref&gt; (both quantities differs just with a figure sign) and then [[Max Planck|Planck]] for the [[Isothermal process|isothermal]]-[[Isobaric process|isobaric]] process.&lt;ref&gt;Planck, M. (1945). ''Treatise on Thermodynamics''. Dover, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the Massieu–Planck [[thermodynamic potential]], known also as ''[[free entropy]]'', has been shown to play a great role in the so-called entropic formulation of [[statistical mechanics]],&lt;ref&gt;Antoni Planes, Eduard Vives, [http://www.ecm.ub.es/condensed/eduard/papers/massieu/node2.html Entropic Formulation of Statistical Mechanics], Entropic variables and Massieu–Planck functions 2000-10-24 Universitat de Barcelona&lt;/ref&gt; applied among the others in molecular biology&lt;ref&gt;John A.

==Brillouin's negentropy principle of information==
In 1953, [[Léon Brillouin]] derived a general equation&lt;ref&gt;Leon Brillouin, The negentropy principle of information, ''J. Applied Physics'' '''24''', 1152–1163 1953&lt;/ref&gt; stating that the changing of an information bit value requires at least kT ln(2) energy. This is the same energy as the work [[Leó Szilárd]]'s engine produces in the idealistic case. In his book,&lt;ref&gt;Leon Brillouin, ''Science and Information theory'', Dover, 1956&lt;/ref&gt; he further explored this problem concluding that any cause of this bit value change (measurement, decision about a yes/no question, erasure, display, etc.) will require the same amount of energy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2833">An '''organizing principle''' is a core assumption from which everything else by proximity can derive a classification or a value.  It is like a central reference point that allows all other objects to be located, often used in a [[conceptual framework]]. Having an organizing principle might help one simplify and get a handle on a particularly complicated domain or phenomenon.  On the other hand, it might create a deceptive prism that colors one's judgment.

The '''original camera negative''' ('''OCN''') is the film in a traditional film-based [[movie camera]] which captures the original image.  This is the film from which all other copies will be made. It is known as '''raw stock''' prior to exposure.

The size of a roll varies depending on the [[film gauge]] and whether or not a new roll, [[re-can]], or [[short end]] was used. One hundred or 400 foot rolls are common in 16mm, while 400 or 1,000 foot (ft) rolls are used in 35mm work. While these are the most common sizes, other lengths such as 200, 800, or 1,200 ft may be commercially available from film stock manufacturers, usually by special order. Rolls of 100 and 200 ft are generally wound on spools for daylight-loading, while longer lengths are only wound around a plastic core. Core-wound stock has no exposure protection outside its packaging, and therefore must be loaded into a [[camera magazine]] within a [[darkroom]] or changing bag/tent in order to prevent the film being fogged.

== Value ==
Original camera negative is of great value, as if lost or damaged it cannot be re-created without re-shooting the scene, something which is often impossible. It also contains the highest-quality version of the original image available, before any analog resolution and dynamic range loss from copying. For these reasons, original camera negative is handled with great care, and only by specialized trained people in dedicated film laboratories.

==Procedures in the laboratory==
After the film is processed by the [[film lab]], camera rolls are assembled into lab rolls of 1,200 to 1,500 ft. Work prints may be made for viewing dailies or editing the picture on film.

Once [[film editing]] is finalized, a [[negative cutting|negative cutter]] will conform the negative using the [[Keykode]] on the edge of the film as a reference, cutting the original camera negative and incorporating any opticals (titles, dissolves, fades, and special effects), and cementing it together into several rolls. 

The edited original negative is then copied to create a safety positive which can be used as a backup to create a usable negative. At this point, an [[answer print]] will be created from the original camera negative, and upon its approval, [[interpositive]]s (IPs) and [[internegative]]s (INs) are created, from which the [[release print]]s are made. Generally speaking, the original camera negative is considered too important and delicate to be used for any processes more than necessary, as each pass through a lab process carries the risk of further degrading the quality of the negative by scratching the emulsion. Once an answer print is approved, the interpositives and internegatives are regarded as the earliest generation of the finished and graded film, and are almost always used for transfers to video or new film restorations. The original camera negatives is usually regarded as a last resort in the event that all of the intermediate elements have been compromised or lost.

The more popular a film is, the higher the likelihood that the original negative is in a worse shape, due to the need to return to the original camera negative to strike new interpositives to replace the exhausted ones, and thus create more internegatives and release prints. Before 1969, 35mm prints were struck directly from the original negative, often running into hundreds of copies, and causing further wear on the original.{{Citation needed|reason=Oh really? I can imagine that prints from the early years of film were struck directly off the original negative, but I seriously doubt this continued through the Golden Age and as late as 1969. --Retro00064|date=June 2013}}

== Digital cameras ==
Physical [[film stock]] is still occasionally used in film-making, particularly in prestige productions where the director and cinematographer have the power to require the extra cost, but as of 2016, it is becoming increasingly rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dga.org/Craft/DGAQ/All-Articles/1503-Summer-2015/Industry-Film-is-Dead.aspx|title=Christopher Nolan fights to keep film alive|last=Hart|first=Hugh|date=Summer 2015|website=www.dga.org|publisher=Directors Guild of America|access-date=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern cinematography, the camera is usually a [[digital camera]], and no physical negative exists. However, the concept of "camera original material" is still used to describe camera image data. Camera original material that has not yet been ingested, duplicated, and archived is in a similar precarious state to original camera negative in a film process. One of the jobs of the [[digital imaging technician]] is to ensure that digital camera original material is backed up as soon as possible.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1004">'''Phonemic imagery''' refers to the processing of thoughts as words rather than as symbols or other images.  It is sometimes referred to as the equivalent of [[Intrapersonal communication|inner speech]]&lt;ref name=Velmans/&gt; or [[Imagined speech|covert speech]],{{cn|date=December 2013}} and sometimes considered as a third phenomenon, separate from but similar to these other forms of internal speech.{{cn|date=December 2013}}

Phonemic imagery is a part of the philosophy of [[consciousness]] rather than [[linguistics]] as it is considered an internal phenomenon of consciousness observed through [[Introspection|reflection]] rather than amenable to [[empirical]] observation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9632">'''Pontryagin's maximum (or minimum) principle''' is used in [[optimal control]] theory to find the best possible control for taking a [[dynamical system]] from one state to another, especially in the presence of constraints for the state or input controls. It was formulated in 1956 by the Russian mathematician [[Lev Pontryagin]] and his students.&lt;ref&gt;See ref. below for first published work.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has as a special case the [[Euler–Lagrange equation]] of the [[calculus of variations]].

The principle states, informally, that the ''control Hamiltonian'' must take an extreme value over controls in the set of all permissible controls. Whether the extreme value is maximum or minimum depends both on the problem and on the sign convention used for defining the Hamiltonian. The normal convention, which is the one used in [[Hamiltonian (control theory)|Hamiltonian]], leads to a maximum hence ''maximum principle'' but the sign convention used in this article makes the extreme value a minimum.

If &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of values of permissible controls then the principle states that the optimal control &lt;math&gt;u^*&lt;/math&gt; must satisfy:
:&lt;math&gt;H(x^*(t),u^*(t),\lambda^*(t),t) \leq H(x^*(t),u,\lambda^*(t),t), \quad \forall u \in \mathcal{U}, \quad t \in [t_0, t_f]&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;x^*\in C^1[t_0,t_f]&lt;/math&gt; is the optimal state trajectory and &lt;math&gt;\lambda^* \in BV[t_0,t_f]&lt;/math&gt; is the optimal [[costate]] trajectory.&lt;ref&gt;More info on [[Smoothness#Order of continuity|C&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;]] and [[Bounded variation|BV]] spaces&lt;/ref&gt;

The result was first successfully applied to minimum time problems where the input control is constrained, but it can also be useful in studying state-constrained problems.

Special conditions for the Hamiltonian can also be derived. When the final time &lt;math&gt;t_f&lt;/math&gt; is fixed and the Hamiltonian does not depend explicitly on time &lt;math&gt;\left(\tfrac{\partial H}{\partial t} \equiv 0\right)&lt;/math&gt;, then:
:&lt;math&gt;H(x^*(t),u^*(t),\lambda^*(t)) \equiv \mathrm{constant}\,&lt;/math&gt;
and if the final time is free, then:
:&lt;math&gt;H(x^*(t),u^*(t),\lambda^*(t)) \equiv 0.\,&lt;/math&gt;
More general conditions on the optimal control are given below.

When satisfied along a trajectory, Pontryagin's minimum principle is a [[necessary condition]] for an optimum. The [[Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation]] provides a [[Necessity and sufficiency|necessary and sufficient condition]] for an optimum, but this condition must be satisfied over the whole of the state space.

While the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation admits [[Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation#Extension to stochastic problems|a straightforward extension]] to stochastic optimal control problems, the minimum principle does not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yong|first1=J.|last2=Zhou|first2=X. Y.|title=Stochastic Controls: Hamiltonian Systems and HJB Equations|date=1999|publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maximization and minimization==

The principle was first known as ''Pontryagin's maximum principle'' and its proof is historically based on maximizing the Hamiltonian. The initial application of this principle was to the maximization of the terminal speed of a rocket. However, as it was subsequently mostly used for minimization of a performance index it has here been referred to as the ''minimum principle''.  Pontryagin's book solved the problem of minimizing a performance index.&lt;ref&gt;See p.13 of the 1962 book of Pontryagin et al. referenced below.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notation==
In what follows we will be making use of the following notation.
:&lt;math&gt;
\Psi_T(x(T))= \frac{\partial \Psi(x)}{\partial T}|_{x=x(T)} \,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\Psi_x(x(T))=\begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial
\Psi(x)}{\partial x_1}|_{x=x(T)} &amp; \cdots &amp; \frac{\partial
\Psi(x)}{\partial x_n} |_{x=x(T)}
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
H_x(x^*,u^*,\lambda^*,t)=\begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial H}{\partial x_1}|_{x=x^*,u=u^*,\lambda=\lambda^*}
&amp; \cdots &amp; \frac{\partial H}{\partial x_n}|_{x=x^*,u=u^*,\lambda=\lambda^*}
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
L_x(x^*,u^*)=\begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial L}{\partial x_1}|_{x=x^*,u=u^*}
&amp; \cdots &amp; \frac{\partial L}{\partial x_n}|_{x=x^*,u=u^*}
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
f_x(x^*,u^*)=\begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_1}|_{x=x^*,u=u^*} &amp; \cdots &amp; \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_n}|_{x=x^*,u=u^*} \\
\vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\ \frac{\partial f_n}{\partial x_1}|_{x=x^*,u=u^*} &amp;
\ldots &amp; \frac{\partial f_n}{\partial x_n}|_{x=x^*,u=u^*}
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Formal statement of necessary conditions for minimization problem==
Here the necessary conditions are shown for minimization of a functional. Take &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to be the state of the [[dynamical system]] with input &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;, such that
:&lt;math&gt;
\dot{x}=f(x,u), \quad x(0)=x_0, \quad u(t) \in \mathcal{U}, \quad t \in
[0,T]
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of admissible controls and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the terminal (i.e., final) time of the system. The control &lt;math&gt;u \in \mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt; must be chosen for all &lt;math&gt;t \in [0,T]&lt;/math&gt; to minimize the objective functional &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; which is defined by the application and can be abstracted as

:&lt;math&gt;
J=\Psi(x(T))+\int^T_0 L(x(t),u(t)) \,dt
&lt;/math&gt;

The constraints on the system dynamics can be adjoined to the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; by introducing time-varying [[Lagrange multipliers|Lagrange multiplier]] vector &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, whose elements are called the costates of the system. This motivates the construction of the [[Hamiltonian (control theory)|Hamiltonian]] &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; defined for all &lt;math&gt;t \in [0,T]&lt;/math&gt; by:
:&lt;math&gt;
H(x(t),u(t),\lambda(t),t)=\lambda^{\rm T}(t)f(x(t),u(t))+L(x(t),u(t)) \,
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\lambda^{\rm T}&lt;/math&gt; is the transpose of &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.

Pontryagin's minimum principle states that the optimal state trajectory &lt;math&gt;x^*&lt;/math&gt;, optimal control &lt;math&gt;u^*&lt;/math&gt;, and corresponding Lagrange multiplier vector &lt;math&gt;\lambda^*&lt;/math&gt; must  minimize the Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; so that

:&lt;math&gt;
(1) \qquad H(x^*(t),u^*(t),\lambda^*(t),t)\leq H(x^*(t),u,\lambda^*(t),t) \,
&lt;/math&gt;

for all time &lt;math&gt;t \in [0,T]&lt;/math&gt; and for all permissible control inputs &lt;math&gt;u \in \mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt;. It must also be the case that

:&lt;math&gt;
(2) \qquad \Psi_T(x(T))+H(T)=0 \,
&lt;/math&gt;

Additionally, the [[costate equations]]

:&lt;math&gt;
(3) \qquad -\dot{\lambda}^{\rm T}(t)=H_x(x^*(t),u^*(t),\lambda(t),t)=\lambda^{\rm T}(t)f_x(x^*(t),u^*(t))+L_x(x^*(t),u^*(t))
&lt;/math&gt;

must be satisfied. If the final state &lt;math&gt;x(T)&lt;/math&gt; is not fixed (i.e., its differential variation is not zero), it must also be that the terminal costates are such that

:&lt;math&gt;
(4) \qquad \lambda^{\rm T}(T)=\Psi_x(x(T)) \,
&lt;/math&gt;

These four conditions in (1)-(4) are the necessary conditions for an optimal control. Note that (4) only applies when &lt;math&gt;x(T)&lt;/math&gt; is free. If it is fixed, then this condition is not necessary for an optimum.

A '''principle''' is a concept or value that is a guide for behavior or evaluation. In [[law]], it is a [[Legal rule|rule]] that has to be or usually is to be followed, or can be desirably followed, or is an inevitable consequence of something, such as the laws observed in  nature or the way that a system is constructed. The principles of such a system are understood by its users as the essential characteristics of the system, or reflecting system's designed purpose, and the effective operation or use of which would be impossible if any one of the principles was to be ignored.&lt;ref&gt;Alpa, Guido (1994) [http://digitalcommons.law.ggu.edu/annlsurvey/vol1/iss1/2/ General Principles of Law], ''Annual Survey of International &amp; Comparative Law'', Vol. 1: Is. 1, Article 2. from [[Golden Gate University School of Law]]&lt;/ref&gt; A system may be explicitly based on and implemented from a document of principles as was done in IBM's [[IBM System/360 architecture|360/370]] ''Principles of Operation''.

Examples of principles are, [[entropy (disambiguation)|entropy]] in a number of fields, [[least action]] in physics, those in descriptive comprehensive and fundamental law: [[doctrine]]s or assumptions forming  normative rules of conduct, [[separation of church and state]] in statecraft, the [[central dogma of molecular biology]], [[wikt:fairness|fairness]] in ethics, etc.

In common English, it is a substantive and collective term referring to rule governance, the absence of which, being "unprincipled", is considered a character defect. It may also be used to declare that a reality has diverged from some ideal or norm as when something is said to be true only "in principle" but not in fact.

==As law==
===As moral law===
[[File:Socrates BM GR1973.03-27.16.jpg|thumb|[[Socrates]] preferred to face execution rather than betray his moral principles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosophy.lander.edu/ethics/socrates.html "The Ethics of Socrates."] ''Philosophy''.  25 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;|upright=0.9]]
{{main|Ethics}}
A principle represents values that orient and rule the conduct of persons in a particular society.  To "act on principle" is to act in accordance with one's moral ideals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/us/politics/jeff-flake-transcript-senate-speech.html "Full Transcript: Jeff Flake’s Speech on the Senate Floor."] ''New York Times''.  24 October 2017.  25 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Principles are absorbed in childhood through a process of [[socialization]]. There is a presumption of liberty of individuals that is restrained.  Exemplary principles include [[First, do no harm]], the [[golden rule]] and the [[doctrine of the mean]].

===As a juridic law===
{{Main|Principle of legality}}
It represents a set of values that inspire the written norms that organize the life of a society submitting to the powers of an authority, generally the State. The law establishes a legal obligation, in a coercive way; it therefore acts as principle [[Classical conditioning|conditioning]] of the action that limits the liberty of the individuals. See, for examples, the [[territorial principle]], [[homestead principle]], and [[precautionary principle]].

===As scientific law===
[[Archimedes principle]], relating buoyancy to the weight of displaced water, is an early example of a  [[law (principle)|law]] in science. Another early one developed by [[Malthus]] is the ''population principle'', now called the [[Malthusian principle]].&lt;ref&gt;Elwell, Frank W.  [http://www.faculty.rsu.edu/users/f/felwell/www/Theorists/Essays/Malthus1.htm "T. Robert Mathus's Principle ...."] ''Rogers State University''.  2013.  25 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Freud also wrote on principles, especially the [[reality principle]] necessary to keep the id and [[pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]] in check. Biologists use the [[principle of priority]] and [[principle of Binominal nomenclature]] for precision in naming [[species]]. There are many principles observed in physics, notably in [[cosmology]] which observes the [[mediocrity principle]], the [[anthropic principle]], the [[principle of relativity]] and the [[cosmological principle]]. Other well-known principles include the [[uncertainty principle]] in [[quantum mechanics]] and the [[pigeonhole principle]] and [[superposition principle]] in mathematics.

==As axiom or logical fundament==
===Principle of sufficient reason===
{{Main|Principle of sufficient reason}}
The principle states that every event has a rational explanation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sufficient-reason/ "Principle of Sufficient Reason."] ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.  7 September 2016.  25 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The principle has a variety of expressions, all of which are perhaps best summarized by the following:

:For every entity ''x'', if ''x'' exists, then there is a sufficient explanation for why ''x'' exists.
:For every event ''e'', if ''e'' occurs, then there is a sufficient explanation for why ''e'' occurs.
:For every proposition ''p'', if ''p'' is true, then there is a sufficient explanation for why ''p'' is true.

However, one realizes that in every sentence there is a direct relation between the predicate and the subject. To say that "the Earth is round", corresponds to a direct relation between the subject and the predicate.

===Principle of non-contradiction===
[[File:Aristoteles Louvre.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bust (sculpture)|Portrait bust]] of Aristotle; an [[Roman Empire|Imperial Roman]] copy of a lost [[bronze sculpture]] made by [[Lysippos]]]]
{{Main|Law of noncontradiction}}
According to [[Aristotle]], “It is impossible for the same thing to belong and not to belong at the same time to the same thing and in the same respect.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-noncontradiction/ "Aristotle on Non-contradiction."] ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.  12 June 2015.  25 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, it is not possible that in exactly the same moment and place, it rains and doesn't rain.&lt;ref&gt;[https://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl201/modules/Philosophers/Aristotle/aristotle_laws_of_thought.html "Great Philosophers."] ''Oregon State University''.  2002.  25 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principle of excluded middle===
{{Main|Law of excluded middle}}
The principle of the excluding third or "principium tertium exclusum" is a principle of the traditional logic formulated canonically by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] as: either ''A'' is ''B'' or ''A'' isn't ''B''. It is read the following way: either ''P'' is true, or its denial ¬''P'' is.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://name.umdl.umich.edu/AAT3201.0001.001|title=Principia mathematica, by Alfred North Whitehead ... and Bertrand Russell.|last=Whitehead|first=Alfred North|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is also known as "''tertium non datur''" ('A third (thing) is not). Classically it is considered to be one of the most important fundamental principles or laws of thought (along with the principles of identity, no contradiction and sufficient reason).

In philosophy and rhetoric, the '''principle of humanity''' states that when interpreting another speaker we must assume that his or her beliefs and desires are connected to each other and to reality in some way, and attribute to him or her "the propositional attitudes one supposes one would have oneself in those circumstances".&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Dennett]], "Mid-Term Examination," in The Intentional Stance, p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of humanity was named by [[Richard Grandy]] (then an assistant professor of philosophy at [[Princeton University]]) who first expressed it in 1973.

The '''principle of nonvacuous contrast''' is a logical or methodological principle which requires that a genuine predicate never refer to everything, or to nothing, within its [[universe of discourse]].

A '''process reference model''' is a [[Conceptual model|model]] that has generic functionality and can be used more than once in different models. The creator of a process model benefits from existing process reference models by not needing to reinvent the process model but only reusing it as a starting point in creating a process model for a specific purpose.

==Process model reuse==
During the identification of processes ideal for reuse, the designer needs to (1) Get approval (2) Provide Organization Scope Context and (3) Identify Process [[Standardization]] Opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;Marne de Vries, Alta van der Merwe, Paula Kotze and Aurona Gerber. (2011) A Method for Identifying Process Reuse Opportunities to Enhance the Operating Model. 2011 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Scientific law versus Scientific theories.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Scientific theories explain why something happens, whereas Scientific Laws record what happens.]]
The '''laws of science''', also called '''[[scientific law]]s''' or '''scientific principles''', are statements that describe or [[prediction|predict]] a range of [[natural phenomena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|law of nature}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each scientific law is a statement based on [[reproducibility|repeated]] [[experiment]]al [[observation]]s that describes some aspect of the [[Universe]]. The term ''law'' has diverse usage in many cases (approximate, accurate, broad, or narrow [[scientific theory|theories]]) across all fields of [[natural science]] ([[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[geology]], [[astronomy]], etc.). Scientific laws summarize and explain a large collection of facts determined by [[experiment]], and are tested based on their ability to predict the results of future experiments. They are developed either from facts or through [[mathematics]], and are strongly supported by [[Empirical evidence|empirical]] [[evidence]]. It is generally understood that they reflect causal relationships fundamental to reality, and are discovered rather than invented.&lt;ref name="McComas2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=William F. McComas|title=The Language of Science Education: An Expanded Glossary of Key Terms and Concepts in Science Teaching and Learning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aXzGBAAAQBAJ|date=30 December 2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-94-6209-497-0|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laws reflect scientific knowledge that experiments have repeatedly verified (and never [[Falsifiability|falsified]]). Their accuracy does not change when new theories are worked out, but rather the scope of application, since the equation (if any) representing the law does not change. As with other scientific knowledge, they do not have absolute certainty (as mathematical [[theorems]] or [[Identity (mathematics)|identities]] do), and it is always possible for a law to be overturned by future observations. A law can usually be formulated as one or several statements or [[equation]]s, so that it can be used to predict the outcome of an experiment, given the circumstances of the processes taking place.

Laws differ from [[hypotheses]] and [[postulates]], which are proposed during the [[Scientific method|scientific process]] before and during validation by experiment and observation. [[Hypotheses]] and [[postulates]] are not laws since they have not been verified to the same degree and may not be sufficiently general, although they may lead to the formulation of laws. A law is a more solidified and formal statement, distilled from repeated experiment. Laws are narrower in scope than [[Scientific theory|scientific theories]], which may contain one or several laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncse.com/evolution/education/definitions-fact-theory-law-scientific-work Definitions from the NCSE]&lt;/ref&gt; Science distinguishes a law or theory from facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://dels.nas.edu/resources/static-assets/materials-based-on-reports/reports-in-brief/role_of_theory_final.pdf | title=The Role of Theory in Advancing 21st Century Biology: Catalyzing Transformative Research |publisher = The National Academy of Sciences |year =2007 |journal=Report in Brief |}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calling a law a [[scientific fact|fact]] is [[ambiguous]], an [[overstatement]], or an [[equivocation]].&lt;ref name=gouldfact&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_fact-and-theory.html | first = Stephen Jay | last = Gould | authorlink = Stephen Jay Gould | title  = Evolution as Fact and Theory | journal = Discover | volume = 2 | issue = 5 | date = 1981-05-01 | pages = 34–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the nature of a scientific law is a question in [[philosophy]] and although scientific laws describe nature mathematically, scientific laws are practical conclusions reached by the [[scientific method]]; they are intended to be neither laden with [[ontology|ontological]] commitments nor statements of logical [[wikt:absolute#Noun|absolutes]].

According to the [[unity of science]] thesis, ''all'' scientific laws follow fundamentally from physics. Laws which occur in other sciences ultimately follow from [[physical law]]s. Often, from mathematically fundamental viewpoints, [[universal constant]]s emerge from a scientific law.

==Overview==
A scientific law always applies under the same conditions, and implies that there is a causal relationship involving its elements. [[Scientific fact|Factual]] and well-confirmed statements like "Mercury is liquid at standard temperature and pressure" are considered too specific to qualify as scientific laws. A central problem in the [[philosophy of science]], going back to [[David Hume]], is that of distinguishing causal relationships (such as those implied by laws) from principles that arise due to [[constant conjunction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Laws differ from [[scientific theory|scientific theories]] in that they do not posit a mechanism or explanation of phenomena: they are merely distillations of the results of repeated observation. As such, a law is limited in applicability to circumstances resembling those already observed, and may be found false when extrapolated. [[Ohm's law]] only applies to linear networks, [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] only applies in weak gravitational fields, the early laws of [[aerodynamics]] such as [[Bernoulli's principle]] do not apply in case of [[compressible flow]] such as occurs in [[transonic]] and [[supersonic]] flight, [[Hooke's law]] only applies to [[strain (physics)|strain]] below the [[elastic limit]], etc. These laws remain useful, but only under the conditions where they apply.

Many laws take [[mathematics|mathematical]] forms, and thus can be stated as an equation; for example, the [[law of conservation of energy]] can be written as &lt;math&gt;\Delta E = 0&lt;/math&gt;, where E is the total amount of energy in the universe. Similarly, the [[first law of thermodynamics]] can be written as &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}U=\delta Q-\delta W\,&lt;/math&gt;.

The term "scientific law" is traditionally associated with the [[natural sciences]], though the [[social sciences]] also contain laws.&lt;ref name=Ehrenberg&gt;[[Andrew S. C. Ehrenberg]] (1993), "[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v365/n6445/pdf/365385a0.pdf Even the Social Sciences Have Laws]", [[Nature (journal)|Nature]], 365:6445 (30), page 385.{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a scientific law in social sciences is [[Zipf's law]].

Like theories and hypotheses, laws make predictions (specifically, they predict that new observations will conform to the law), and can be [[Falsifiability|falsified]] if they are found in contradiction with new data.

== Conservation laws ==

===Conservation and symmetry===
{{main article|Symmetry (physics)}}

Most significant laws in science are [[conservation laws]]. These fundamental laws follow from homogeneity of space, time and [[phase (waves)|phase]], in other words ''symmetry''.

*'''[[Noether's theorem]]:''' Any quantity which has a continuous differentiable symmetry in the action has an associated conservation law.
* [[Conservation of mass]] was the first law of this type to be understood, since most macroscopic physical processes involving masses, for example collisions of massive particles or fluid flow, provide the apparent belief that mass is conserved. Mass conservation was observed to be true for all chemical reactions. In general this is only approximative, because with the advent of relativity and experiments in nuclear and particle physics: mass can be transformed into energy and vice versa, so mass is not always conserved, but part of the more general conservation of mass-energy.
*'''[[Conservation of energy]]''', '''[[Conservation of momentum|momentum]]''' and '''[[Conservation of angular momentum|angular momentum]]''' for isolated systems can be found to be [[Time translation symmetry|symmetries in time]], translation, and rotation.
*'''[[Conservation of charge]]''' was also realized since charge has never been observed to be created or destroyed, and only found to move from place to place.

===Continuity and transfer===

Conservation laws can be expressed using the general [[continuity equation]] (for a conserved quantity) can be written in differential form as:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}=-\nabla \cdot \mathbf{J} &lt;/math&gt;

where ρ is some quantity per unit volume, '''J''' is the [[flux]] of that quantity (change in quantity per unit time per unit area). Intuitively, the [[divergence]] (denoted ∇•) of a [[vector field]] is a measure of flux diverging radially outwards from a point, so the negative is the amount piling up at a point, hence the rate of change of density in a region of space must be the amount of flux leaving or collecting in some region (see main article for details). In the table below, the fluxes, flows for various physical quantities in transport, and their associated continuity equations, are collected for comparison.

==Laws of classical mechanics==

===Principle of least action===

{{Main|Principle of least action}}

All of classical mechanics, including [[Newton's laws]], [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrange's equations]], [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamilton's equations]], etc., can be derived from this very simple principle:

:&lt;math&gt; \delta \mathcal{S} = \delta\int_{t_1}^{t_2} L(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{\dot{q}}, t) dt = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{S} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[action (physics)|action]]; the integral of the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]]

:&lt;math&gt; L(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{\dot{q}}, t) = T(\mathbf{\dot{q}}, t)-V(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{\dot{q}}, t)&lt;/math&gt;

of the physical system between two times ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The kinetic energy of the system is ''T'' (a function of the rate of change of the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration]] of the system), and [[potential energy]] is ''V'' (a function of the configuration and its rate of change). The configuration of a system which has ''N'' [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]] is defined by [[generalized coordinates]] '''q''' = (''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... ''q&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;'').

There are [[Canonical coordinates|generalized momenta]] conjugate to these coordinates, '''p''' = (''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''p&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;''), where:

:&lt;math&gt;p_i = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i}&lt;/math&gt;

The action and Lagrangian both contain the dynamics of the system for all times. The term "path" simply refers to a curve traced out by the system in terms of the [[generalized coordinates]] in the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]], i.e. the curve '''q'''(''t''), parameterized by time (see also [[parametric equation]] for this concept).

The action is a ''[[functional (mathematics)|functional]]'' rather than a ''[[function (mathematics)|function]]'', since it depends on the Lagrangian, and the Lagrangian depends on the path '''q'''(''t''), so the action depends on the ''entire'' "shape" of the path for all times (in the time interval from ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Between two instants of time, there are infinitely many paths, but one for which the action is stationary (to the first order) is the true path. The stationary value for the ''entire continuum'' of Lagrangian values corresponding to some path, ''not just one value'' of the Lagrangian, is required (in other words it is ''not'' as simple as "differentiating a function and setting it to zero, then solving the equations to find the points of [[maxima and minima]] etc", rather this idea is applied to the entire "shape" of the function, see [[calculus of variations]] for more details on this procedure).&lt;ref&gt;Feynman Lectures on Physics: Volume 2, R.P. Feynman, R.B. Leighton, M. Sands, Addison-Wesley, 1964, {{isbn|0-201-02117-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notice ''L'' is ''not'' the total energy ''E'' of the system due to the difference, rather than the sum:

:&lt;math&gt;E=T+V&lt;/math&gt;

Kibble, European Physics Series, McGraw-Hill (UK), 1973, {{isbn|0-07-084018-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; general approaches to classical mechanics are summarized below in the order of establishment. They are equivalent formulations, Newton's is very commonly used due to simplicity, but Hamilton's and Lagrange's equations are more general, and their range can extend into other branches of physics with suitable modifications.

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t} \left ( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i } \right ) = \frac{\partial L}{\partial q_i} &lt;/math&gt;

Using the definition of generalized momentum, there is the symmetry:

'''[[Newton's laws of motion]]'''

They are low-limit solutions to [[theory of relativity|relativity]]. Alternative formulations of Newtonian mechanics are [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] and [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] mechanics.

The laws can be summarized by two equations (since the 1st is a special case of the 2nd, zero resultant acceleration):

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{p}}{\mathrm{d}t}, \quad \mathbf{F}_{ij}=-\mathbf{F}_{ji} &lt;/math&gt;

where '''p''' = momentum of body, '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; = force ''on'' body ''i'' ''by'' body ''j'', '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''ji''&lt;/sub&gt; = force ''on'' body ''j'' ''by'' body ''i''.

For a [[dynamical system]] the two equations (effectively) combine into one:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{p}_\mathrm{i}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \mathbf{F}_{E} + \sum_{\mathrm{i} \neq \mathrm{j}} \mathbf{F}_\mathrm{ij} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

in which '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; = resultant external force (due to any agent not part of system). Body ''i'' does not exert a force on itself.

From the above, any equation of motion in classical mechanics can be derived.

==Laws of gravitation and relativity==

===Modern laws===

;[[Special relativity]]

Postulates of special relativity are not "laws" in themselves, but assumptions of their nature in terms of ''relative motion''.

Often two are stated as "the laws of physics are the same in all [[inertial frames]]" and "the [[speed of light]] is constant". However the second is redundant, since the speed of light is predicted by [[Maxwell's equations]]. Essentially there is only one.

The said posulate leads to the [[Lorentz transformations]] – the transformation law between two [[frame of reference]]s moving relative to each other. For any [[4-vector]]

:&lt;math&gt;A' =\Lambda A &lt;/math&gt;

this replaces the [[Galilean transformation]] law from classical mechanics. The Lorentz transformations reduce to the Galilean transformations for low velocities much less than the speed of light ''c''.

The magnitudes of 4-vectors are invariants - ''not'' "conserved", but the same for all inertial frames (i.e. every observer in an inertial frame will agree on the same value), in particular if ''A'' is the [[four-momentum]], the magnitude can derive the famous invariant equation for mass-energy and momentum conservation (see [[invariant mass]]):

:&lt;math&gt; E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2 &lt;/math&gt;

in which the (more famous) [[mass-energy equivalence]] ''E'' = ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is a special case.

;[[General relativity]]

General relativity is governed by the [[Einstein field equation]]s, which describe the curvature of space-time due to mass-energy equivalent to the gravitational field. Solving the equation for the geometry of space warped due to the mass distribution gives the [[metric tensor]]. Using the geodesic equation, the motion of masses falling along the geodesics can be calculated.

;[[Gravitomagnetism]]

In a relatively flat spacetime due to weak gravitational fields, gravitational analogues of Maxwell's equations can be found; the '''GEM equations''', to describe an analogous ''[[Gravitomagnetism|gravitomagnetic field]]''. They are well established by the theory, and experimental tests form ongoing research.&lt;ref name="Gravitation and Inertia"&gt;Gravitation and Inertia, I. Ciufolini and J.A.

[[Maxwell's equations]] give the time-evolution of the [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field|magnetic]] fields due to [[electric charge]] and [[Electric current|current]] distributions. Given the fields, the [[Lorentz force]] law is the [[equation of motion]] for charges in the fields.

These equations can be modified to include [[magnetic monopole]]s, and are consistent with our observations of monopoles either existing or not existing; if they do not exist, the generalized equations reduce to the ones above, if they do, the equations become fully symmetric in electric and magnetic charges and currents. Indeed, there is a duality transformation where electric and magnetic charges can be "rotated into one another", and still satisfy Maxwell's equations.

;Pre-Maxwell laws

These laws were found before the formulation of Maxwell's equations. They are not fundamental, since they can be derived from Maxwell's Equations. Coulomb's Law can be found from Gauss' Law (electrostatic form) and the Biot–Savart Law can be deduced from Ampere's Law (magnetostatic form). Lenz' Law and Faraday's Law can be incorporated into the Maxwell-Faraday equation. Nonetheless they are still very effective for simple calculations.

In actuality, optical properties of matter are significantly more complex and require quantum mechanics.

== Laws of quantum mechanics==

Quantum mechanics has its roots in [[postulates of quantum mechanics|postulates]]. This leads to results which are not usually called "laws", but hold the same status, in that all of quantum mechanics follows from them.

One postulate that a particle (or a system of many particles) is described by a [[wavefunction]], and this satisfies a quantum wave equation: namely the [[Schrödinger equation]] (which can be written as a non-relativistic wave equation, or a [[relativistic wave equation]]). Solving this wave equation predicts the time-evolution of the system's behaviour, analogous to solving Newton's laws in classical mechanics.

Other postulates change the idea of physical observables; using [[operators (physics)|quantum operators]]; some measurements can't be made at the same instant of time ([[Uncertainty principle]]s), particles are fundamentally indistinguishable. Another postulate; the [[wavefunction collapse]] postulate, counters the usual idea of a measurement in science.

== Laws of chemistry ==
{{Main|Chemical law}}

'''Chemical laws''' are those [[natural law|laws of nature]] relevant to [[chemistry]]. Historically, observations led to many empirical laws, though now it is known that chemistry has its foundations in [[quantum mechanics]].

;[[Quantitative analysis (chemistry)|Quantitative analysis]]

The most fundamental concept in chemistry is the [[law of conservation of mass]], which states that there is no detectable change in the quantity of matter during an ordinary [[chemical reaction]]. Modern physics shows that it is actually [[energy]] that is conserved, and that [[Mass–energy equivalence|energy and mass are related]]; a concept which becomes important in [[nuclear chemistry]]. [[Conservation of energy]] leads to the important concepts of [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]], [[thermodynamics]], and [[chemical kinetics|kinetics]].

Additional laws of chemistry elaborate on the law of conservation of mass.  [[Joseph Proust]]'s [[law of definite composition]] says that pure chemicals are composed of elements in a definite formulation; we now know that the structural arrangement of these elements is also important.

[[John Dalton|Dalton]]'s [[law of multiple proportions]] says that these chemicals will present themselves in proportions that are small whole numbers (i.e. 1:2 for [[Oxygen]]:[[Hydrogen]] ratio in water); although in many systems (notably [[Biomolecule|biomacromolecules]] and [[minerals]]) the ratios tend to require large numbers, and are frequently represented as a fraction.

More modern laws of chemistry define the relationship between energy and its transformations.

;[[Reaction kinetics]] and [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibria]]

* In equilibrium, molecules exist in mixture defined by the transformations possible on the timescale of the equilibrium, and are in a ratio defined by the intrinsic energy of the molecules—the lower the intrinsic energy, the more abundant the molecule. [[Le Chatelier's principle]] states that the system opposes changes in conditions from equilibrium states, i.e. there is an opposition to change the state of an equilibrium reaction.
* Transforming one structure to another requires the input of energy to cross an energy barrier; this can come from the intrinsic energy of the molecules themselves, or from an external source which will generally accelerate transformations.  The higher the energy barrier, the slower the transformation occurs.
* There is a hypothetical intermediate, or ''transition structure'', that corresponds to the structure at the top of the energy barrier.  The [[Hammond's postulate|Hammond–Leffler postulate]] states that this structure looks most similar to the product or starting material which has intrinsic energy closest to that of the energy barrier.  Stabilizing this hypothetical intermediate through chemical interaction is one way to achieve [[catalysis]].
* All chemical processes are reversible (law of [[microscopic reversibility]]) although some processes have such an energy bias, they are essentially irreversible.
* The reaction rate has the mathematical parameter known as the [[rate constant]]. The [[Arrhenius equation]] gives the temperature and [[activation energy]] dependence of the rate constant, an empirical law.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11668">'''Signed zero''' is [[zero]] with an associated [[Plus and minus signs|sign]]. In ordinary arithmetic, the number 0 does not have a sign, so that −0, +0 and 0 are identical. However, in [[computing]], some number representations allow for the existence of two zeros, often denoted by '''−0''' ('''negative zero''') and '''+0''' ('''positive zero'''), regarded as equal by the numerical comparison operations but with possible different behaviors in particular operations. This occurs in the ''sign and magnitude'' and ''ones' complement'' [[signed number representation]]s for integers, and in most [[floating-point number]] representations. The number 0 is usually encoded as +0, but can be represented by either +0 or −0.

The [[IEEE 754]] standard for floating-point arithmetic (presently used by most computers and programming languages that support floating point numbers) requires both +0 and −0. Real arithmetic with signed zeros can be considered a variant of the [[extended real number line]] such that 1/−0 = −[[infinity|∞]] and 1/+0 = +∞; [[Division (mathematics)|division]] is only [[Indeterminate form|undefined]] for [[Plus-minus sign|±]]0/±0 and ±∞/±∞.

Negatively signed zero echoes the [[mathematical analysis]] concept of approaching 0 from below as a [[one-sided limit]], which may be denoted by ''x''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;0&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, ''x''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;0−, or ''x''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;↑0.  The notation "−0" may be used informally to denote a small negative number that has been [[rounding|rounded]] to zero.  The concept of negative zero also has some theoretical applications in [[statistical mechanics]] and other disciplines.

It is claimed that the inclusion of signed zero in IEEE&amp;nbsp;754 makes it much easier to achieve numerical accuracy in some critical problems,&lt;ref&gt;[[William Kahan]], "Branch Cuts for Complex Elementary Functions, or Much Ado About Nothing's Sign Bit", in [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=59678 ''The State of the Art in Numerical Analysis''] (eds. Iserles and Powell), Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; in particular when computing with [[complex number|complex]] elementary functions.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Kahan]], [http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/Math185/Derivative.pdf Derivatives in the Complex z-plane], p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the concept of signed zero runs contrary to the general assumption made in most mathematical fields that negative zero is the same thing as zero.  Representations that allow negative zero can be a source of errors in programs, if software developers do not take into account that while the two zero representations behave as equal under numeric comparisons, they yield different results in some operations.

==Representations==
The widely used [[two's complement]] encoding does not allow a negative zero.  In a 1+7-bit [[signed magnitude|sign-and-magnitude]] representation for integers, negative zero is represented by the bit string {{gaps|1000|0000}}. In an 8-bit [[one's complement]] representation, negative zero is represented by the bit string {{gaps|1111|1111}}. In all three encodings, positive zero is represented by {{gaps|0000|0000}}.

[[Image:IEEE 754 Single Negative Zero.svg|thumb|right|400px|Negative zero by IEEE 754 representation in [[binary32]] ]]
In [[IEEE floating-point standard|IEEE 754]] binary floating point numbers, zero values are represented by the biased exponent and [[significand]] both being zero. Negative zero has the sign bit set to one.  One may obtain negative zero as the result of certain computations, for instance as the result of [[arithmetic underflow]] on a negative number, or &lt;code&gt;−1.0×0.0&lt;/code&gt;, or simply as &lt;code&gt;−0.0&lt;/code&gt;.

In [[IEEE 754-2008|IEEE 754]] decimal floating point encoding, a negative zero is represented by an exponent being any valid exponent in the range for the encoding, the true significand being zero, and the sign bit being one.

==Properties and handling==
The IEEE 754 floating point standard specifies the behavior of positive zero and negative zero under various operations.  The outcome may depend on the current [[floating point#Rounding modes|IEEE rounding mode]] settings.

===Notation===
In systems that include both signed and unsigned zeros, the notation &lt;math&gt;0^+&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0^-&lt;/math&gt; is sometimes used for signed zeros.

===Arithmetic===
Addition and multiplication are commutative, but there are some special rules that have to be followed, which mean the usual mathematical rules for algebraic simplification may not apply. The &lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt; sign below shows the signed result of the operations.

The usual rule for signs is always followed when multiplying or dividing:

* &lt;math&gt;\frac{-0}{ \left| x \right| } = -0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; different from 0)
* &lt;math&gt;(-0) \cdot (-0) = +0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

There are special rules for adding or subtracting signed zero:

* &lt;math&gt;x + (\pm 0) = x\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; different from 0)
* &lt;math&gt;(-0) + (-0) = (-0) - (+0) = -0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;(+0) + (+0) = (+0) - (-0) = +0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;x - x = x + (-x) = +0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (for any finite &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, −0 when rounding toward negative)

Because of negative zero (and also when the rounding mode is upward or downward), the expressions {{nowrap|−(''x'' − ''y'')}} and {{nowrap|(−''x'') − (−''y'')}}, for floating-point variables ''x'' and ''y'', cannot be replaced by {{nowrap|''y'' − ''x''}}. However {{nowrap|(−0) + ''x''}} can be replaced by ''x'' with rounding to nearest (except when ''x'' can be a [[NaN#Signaling NaN|signaling NaN]]).

Some other special rules:

* &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-0} = -0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://speleotrove.com/decimal/daops.html#refsqrt|title=Decimal Arithmetic: Arithmetic operations{{snd}}square-root|first=Mike|last=Cowlishaw|authorlink=Mike Cowlishaw|date=7 April 2009|publisher=speleotrove.com ([[IBM Corporation]])|accessdate=7 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\frac{-0}{-\infty} = +0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;  (follows the sign rule for division)
* &lt;math&gt;\frac{\left|x\right|}{-0} = -\infty\,\!&lt;/math&gt;  (for non-zero &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, follows the sign rule for division)
* &lt;math&gt;{\pm 0} \times {\pm \infty} = \mbox{NaN}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; ([[Not a Number]] or interrupt for [[indeterminate form]])
* &lt;math&gt;\frac{\pm 0}{\pm 0} = \mbox{NaN}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Division of a non-zero number by zero sets the divide by zero [[flag (computing)|flag]], and an operation producing a NaN sets the invalid operation flag. An [[exception handling|exception handler]] is called if enabled for the corresponding flag.

===Comparisons===
According to the IEEE&amp;nbsp;754 standard, negative zero and positive zero should compare as equal with the usual (numerical) comparison operators, like the &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; operators of [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[Java programming language|Java]].  In those languages, special programming tricks may be needed to distinguish the two values:

* [[Type punning]] the number to an integer type, so as to look at the sign bit in the bit pattern;
* using the ISO C &lt;code&gt;copysign()&lt;/code&gt; function (IEEE&amp;nbsp;754 copySign operation) to copy the sign of the zero to some non-zero number;
* using the ISO C &lt;code&gt;signbit()&lt;/code&gt; macro (IEEE&amp;nbsp;754 isSignMinus operation) that returns whether the sign bit of a number is set;
* taking the reciprocal of the zero to obtain either 1/(+0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;+∞ or 1/(−0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−∞ (if the [[division by zero]] exception is not trapped).

Note: [[Cast (computer programming)|Casting]] to integral type will not always work, especially on two's complement systems.

However, some programming languages may provide alternative comparison operators that do distinguish the two zeros. This is the case, for example, of the &lt;tt&gt;equals&lt;/tt&gt; method in Java's &lt;code&gt;Double&lt;/code&gt; wrapper class.&lt;ref&gt;[http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Double.html#equals%28java.lang.Object%29 http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Double.html#equals(java.lang.Object)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific uses==
Informally, one may use the notation "−0" for a negative value that was rounded to zero.  This notation may be useful when a negative sign is significant; for example, when tabulating [[Celsius]] temperatures, where a negative sign means ''below freezing''.

In statistical mechanics, one sometimes uses [[negative temperature]]s to describe systems with [[population inversion]], which can be considered to have a temperature greater than positive infinity, because the coefficient of energy in the population distribution function is &amp;minus;1/Temperature. In this context, a temperature of &amp;minus;0 is a (theoretical) temperature larger than any other negative temperature, corresponding to the (theoretical) maximum conceivable extent of population inversion, the opposite extreme to +0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Charles Kittel|Kittel, Charles]] and [[Herbert Kroemer]] | title=Thermal Physics (2nd ed.) | publisher=W.

[[File:Blank stop sign octagon.svg|thumb|upright|A red [[octagon]] symbolizes "stop" even without the word.|alt=Silhouette of a red octagon]]

A '''symbol''' is a mark, sign  or word that indicates, signifies, or is understood as representing an idea, object, or relationship. Symbols allow people to go beyond what is [[know]]n or seen by creating linkages between otherwise very different concepts and experiences. All communication (and data processing) is achieved through the use of symbols. Symbols take the form of words, sounds, gestures, ideas or visual images and are used to convey other ideas and beliefs. For example, a red octagon may be a symbol for "STOP". On a map, a blue line might represent a river. [[Numeral system|Numerals]] are symbols for [[number]]s. [[Alphabet]]ic letters may be symbols for sounds. Personal names are symbols representing individuals. A red rose may symbolize love and compassion. The [[variable (mathematics)|variable]] 'x', in a mathematical equation, may symbolize the position of a particle in space.

In [[cartography]], an organized collection of symbols forms a [[Legend (map)#Map symbology|legend]] for a map.

==Etymology==
The word ''symbol'' derives from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] σύμβολον ''symbolon'', meaning "token,  watchword" from σύν ''syn'' "together" and βάλλω ''bállō'' " "I throw, put." The sense evolution in Greek is from "throwing things together" to "contrasting" to "comparing" to "token used in comparisons to determine if something is genuine." Hence, "outward sign" of something. The meaning "something which stands for something else" was first recorded in 1590, in [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[Faerie Queene]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=symbol&amp;searchmode=none Online Etymological Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
In considering the effect of a symbol on the psyche, in his seminal essay ''The Symbol without Meaning'' [[Joseph Campbell]] proposes the following definition:
''A symbol is an energy evoking, and directing, agent''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Joseph|title=Flight of the Wild Gander:- The Symbol without Meaning|year=2002|publisher=New World Library|location=California|isbn=1-57731-210-4|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, expanding on what he means by this definition Campbell says:

:"a symbol, like everything else, shows a double aspect. We must distinguish, therefore between the 'sense' and the 'meaning' of the symbol. It seems to me perfectly clear that all the great and little symbolical systems of the past functioned simultaneously on three levels: the corporeal of waking consciousness, the spiritual of dream, and the ineffable of the absolutely unknowable. The term 'meaning' can refer only to the first two but these, today, are in the charge of science – which is the province as we have said, not of symbols but of signs. The ineffable, the absolutely unknowable, can be only sensed. It is the province of art which is not 'expression' merely, or even primarily, but a quest for, and formulation of, experience evoking, energy-waking images: yielding what [[Sir Herbert Read]] has aptly termed a 'sensuous apprehension of being'.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, ''The Symbol without Meaning p153''&lt;/ref&gt;
Jared Elisha defined symbolism that is something that stands for another, it can be place, object, or a person

[[Heinrich Zimmer]] gives a concise overview of the nature, and perennial relevance, of symbols.

:"Concepts and words are symbols, just as visions, rituals, and images are; so too are the manners and customs of daily life. Through all of these a transcendent reality is mirrored. There are so many metaphors reflecting and implying something which, though thus variously expressed, is ineffable, though thus rendered multiform, remains inscrutable. Symbols hold the mind to truth but are not themselves the truth, hence it is delusory to borrow them. Each civilisation, every age, must bring forth its own."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Heinrich Zimmer; edited by Joseph|title=Philosophies of India|year=1969|publisher=Princeton Univ. Press|location=Princeton|isbn=0-691-01758-1|pages=1–2|edition=9. paperback print.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''Signs and Symbols, ''it is stated that ''A symbol ... is a visual image or sign representing an idea -- a deeper indicator of a universal truth.''&lt;ref&gt;Dorling Kindersley Limited. Signs and Symbols. p.6. {{ISBN|978-0-7566-3393-6}}. 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Symbols are a means of complex communication that often can have multiple levels of meaning.&lt;ref name= "Womack"&gt;Womack, Mari. Symbols and Meaning: A Concise Introduction. California: AltaMira Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; This separates symbols from [[sign]]s, as signs have only one meaning.

Human cultures use symbols to express specific ideologies and social structures and to represent aspects of their specific culture.  Thus, symbols carry meanings that depend upon one’s cultural background; in other words, the meaning of a symbol is not inherent in the symbol itself but is culturally learned.&lt;ref name="Womack" /&gt;

Symbols are the basis of all human understanding and serve as vehicles of conception for all human knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Langer, Susanne K.  A Theory of Art, Developed From: Philosophy in a New Key. New York: Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt; Symbols facilitate understanding of the world in which we live, thus serving as the grounds upon which we make judgments.&lt;ref name="Catherine"&gt;Palczewski, Catherine, and Ice, Richard, and Fritch, John. Rhetoric in Civic Life. Pennsylvania: Strata Publishing, Inc., 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, people use symbols not only to make sense of the world around them, but also to [[Identification (psychology)|identify]] and cooperate in society through [[constitutive rhetoric]].

==Symbols and semiotics==

[[Semiotics]] is the study of signs, symbols, and signification as communicative behavior. Semiotics studies focus on the relationship of the signifier and the signified, also taking into account interpretation of visual cues, body language, sound, and other contextual clues.  Semiotics is linked with both [[linguistics]] and psychology.  Semioticians thus not only study what a symbol implies, but also how it got its meaning and how it functions to make meaning in society.  Symbols allow the human brain continuously to create meaning using sensory input and decode symbols through both [[denotation]] and [[connotation]].

==Psychoanalysis, rhetoric and archetypes==
Swiss psychoanalyst [[Carl Jung]], who studied [[archetype]]s, proposed an alternative definition of symbol, distinguishing it from the term ''[[Sign (linguistics)|sign]]''. In Jung's view, a sign stands for something known, as a word stands for its referent. He contrasted this with ''symbol'', which he used to stand for something that is unknown and that cannot be made clear or precise.  An example of a symbol in this sense is [[Christ]] as a symbol of the [[archetype]] called ''[[Self in Jungian psychology|self]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Christ, A symbol of the self CW vol 9i Aion RKP 1958&lt;/ref&gt; For example, written languages are composed of a variety of different symbols that create words, p. . Through these written words humans communicate with each other. [[Kenneth Burke]] described ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' as a "[[Definition of man|symbol-using, symbol making, and symbol misusing animal]]" to suggest that a person creates symbols as well as misuses them. One example he uses to indicate what he means by the misuse of symbol is the story of a man who, when told that a particular food item was whale blubber, could barely keep from throwing it up. Later, his friend discovered it was actually just a dumpling. But the man's reaction was a direct consequence of the symbol of "blubber" representing something inedible in his mind. In addition, the symbol of "blubber" was created by the man through various kinds of [[learning]].

Burke goes on to describe symbols as also being derived from [[Sigmund Freud]]'s work on [[Condensation (psychology)|condensation]] and [[Displacement (psychology)|displacement]], further stating that symbols are not just relevant to the [[The Interpretation of Dreams|theory of dreams]] but also to "normal symbol systems". He says they'''{{clarify|date=December 2013}}'''&lt;!--What is "they"?--&gt; are related through "substitution", where one word, phrase, or symbol is substituted for another in order to change the meaning{{clarify|date=December 2013}}&lt;!--The meaning of what?--&gt;. In other words, if one person does not understand a certain word or phrase, another person may substitute a synonym or symbol in order to get the meaning across. However, upon learning the new way of interpreting a specific symbol, the person may change his or her already-formed ideas to incorporate the new information{{clarify|date=December 2013}}&lt;!--This is still not clear.  These last two sentences do not clearly support or explain the one before it--&gt;.

[[Jean Dalby Clift]] says that people not only add their own interpretations to symbols, they also create personal symbols that represent their own understanding of their lives: what she calls "core images" of the person.  She argues that symbolic work with these personal symbols or core images can be as useful as working with dream symbols in psychoanalysis or counseling.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Dalby Clift, ''Core Images of the Self: A Symbolic Approach to Healing and Wholeness''.  Crossroad, 1992. {{page needed|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William Indick suggests that the symbols that are commonly found in myth, legend, and fantasy fulfil psychological functions and hence are why archetypes such as "the hero," "the princess" and "the witch" have remained popular for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130629202403/http://www.mcfarlandpub.com/book-2.php?id=978-0-7864-6039-7 Indick, William. Ancient Symbology in Fantasy Literature: A Psychological Study. Jefferson: McFarland &amp;, 2012. Print.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paul Tillich==

[[Paul Tillich]] argued that, while signs are invented and forgotten, symbols are born and die.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Theology of Culture|last = Tillich|first = Paul|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1964|isbn = 0195007115|location = |pages = 58}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are, therefore, dead and living symbols. A living symbol can reveal to an individual hidden levels of meaning and transcendent or religious realities.  For Tillich a symbol always "points beyond itself" to something that is unquantifiable and mysterious; symbols open up the "depth dimension of reality itself".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Theology of Culture|last = Tillich|first = Paul|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1964|isbn = 0195007115|location = |pages = 59}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Symbols are complex, and their meanings can evolve as the individual or culture evolves. When a symbol loses its meaning and power for an individual or culture, it becomes a dead symbol.
When a symbol becomes identified with the deeper reality to which it refers, it becomes idolatrous as the "symbol is taken for reality." The symbol itself is substituted for the deeper meaning it intends to convey. The unique nature of a symbol is that it gives access to deeper layers of reality which are otherwise inaccessible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Theology of Culture|last = Tillich|first = Paul|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1964|isbn = 0195007115|location = |pages = 54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of context in symbolism==
{{Original research|section|date=January 2010}}
A symbol's [[Meaning (non-linguistic)|meaning]] may be modified by various factors including popular usage, [[history]], and contextual [[intent (law)|intent]].

===Historical meaning===
The history of a symbol is one of many factors in determining a particular symbol's apparent meaning. Consequently, symbols with emotive power carry problems analogous to [[false etymologies]].

===Context===
The context of a symbol may change its meaning.  Similar five-pointed stars might signify a [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] officer or a member of the [[armed services]], depending upon the [[uniform]].

== Symbols in Cartography ==
[[File:Cartographic Symbols.jpg|thumb|The three categories of cartographic symbol shapes.]]
Symbols are used in cartography to communicate geographical information (generally as point, line, or area features).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Principles of map design |last=Tyner |first=Judith A. |date=2010|publisher=Guilford Press |isbn=9781606235447 |location=New York |oclc=437300476}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with other symbols, visual variables such as size, shape, orientation, texture, and pattern provide meaning to the symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Cartography : thematic map design |last=Dent |first=Borden D. |last2=Torguson |first2=Jeffrey |last3=Hodler |first3=T. W. |isbn=0072943823 |edition=6th |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education |oclc=184827987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The form, or shape, of a cartographic symbol is classified into one of three main groups:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=How maps work : representation, visualization, and design |last=MacEachren |first=Alan M. |date=1995 |publisher=Guilford Press |isbn=0898625890 |location=New York |oclc=31078855}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pictorial/Representational''' - a shape or image that clearly resembles the geographic feature being symbolized and can be interpreted without a legend.

'''Associative''' - a mixture of pictorial and geometric elements that produce an easily recognizable shape.

'''Abstract/Geometric''' - completely arbitrary shapes chosen to represent a certain feature.

==Symbolic action==
A '''symbolic action''' is an action that has no, or little, practical effect but symbolizes, or signals, what the actor wants or believes.  The action conveys meaning to the viewers.

Symbolic action may overlap with [[symbolic speech]], such as the use of [[flag burning]] to express hostility or saluting the flag to express patriotism.&lt;ref name="Bagossy2008"&gt;Bagossy, Renate. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=4LyziXxw238C&amp;pg=PA16 The Difficulty of the Amendment Process of the Constitution of the United States of America and Freedom of Speech and its limits]''. GRIN Verlag; 2008-08-11 [cited 5 November 2012]. {{ISBN|9783640129546}}. p. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to intense public criticism, businesses, organizations, and governments may take symbolic actions rather than, or in addition to, directly addressing the identified problems.&lt;ref name="Bednar2008"&gt;Bednar, Michael Kay. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=7Fyefq5LV8sC How Symbolic Action Affects the Media as a Governance Mechanism]''. ProQuest; 2008. {{ISBN|9780549738817}}. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Symbolic actions are sometimes derided as [[slacktivism]].

The Circumplex Model is a graphical representation of emotional states. Fundamentally, it is a circle with pleasant on the left, unpleasant on the right, activation on the top, and deactivation on the bottom. All the other emotions are placed around the circle as combinations of these four basic states. It is based on the theory that people experience emotions as overlapping and ambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=2367156|year=2005|author1=Posner|first1=J|title=The circumplex model of affect: An integrative approach to affective neuroscience, cognitive development, and psychopathology|journal=Development and Psychopathology|volume=17|issue=3|pages=715–734|last2=Russell|first2=J.

S.|doi=10.1017/S0954579405050340|pmid=16262989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Group dynamics are the distinctive behaviors and attitudes observed by people in groups, and the study thereof. It is of most interest in the business world, the workforce, or any other setting where the performance of a group is important. [[Joseph E McGrath]] enlarged the circumplex model to include group dynamics, based on the work of Shaw, Carter, Hackman, Steiner, Shiflett, Taylor, Lorge, Davis, Laughlin, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A CIRCUMPLEX MODEL OF GROUP TASK TYPES|url=https://www.uni-muenster.de/imperia/md/content/psyifp/aeechterhoff/wintersemester2011-12/vorlesungkommperskonflikt/mcgrath_groupinteractperfom_1984.pdf|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are four quadrants in this model representing: generating a task, choosing correct procedure, conflict resolution, and execution, and again there are subtypes distributed around the circle. He used this model as a research tool to evaluate group task performance.

== Group dynamics ==
[[Group dynamics]] involve the influential actions, processes and changes that exist both within and between groups.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book
| title = Group dynamics
| last = Forsyth
| first = D. R.
| publisher = Wadsworth

| location = New York
| pages = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Group dynamics also involve the scientific study of group processes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Through extensive research in the field of group dynamics, it is now well known that all groups, despite their innumerable differences, possess common properties and dynamics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Social psychological researchers have attempted to organize these commonalities, in order to further understand the genuine nature of group processes.

For instance, social psychological research indicates that there are numerous goal-related interactions and activities that groups of all sizes undertake . These interactions have been categorized by [[Robert F. Bales]], who spent his entire life attempting to find an answer to the question, "What do people do when they are in groups?".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; To simplify the understanding of group interactions, Bales concluded that all interactions within groups could be categorized as either a ''relationship interaction'' (or socioemotional interaction) or a ''task interaction''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

| last = Bales
| first = R. F.
| publisher = Transaction

| isbn = 
| location = New Brunswick, NJ
| pages = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
Just as Bales was determined to identify the basic types of '''interactions''' involved in groups, [[Joseph E. McGrath]] was determined to identify the various '''goal-related activities''' that are regularly displayed by groups. McGrath contributed greatly to the understanding of group dynamics through the development of his '''circumplex model of group tasks'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

| pages = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; As intended, McGrath's model effectively organizes all group-related activities by distinguishing between four basic group goals. These goals are referred to as the circumplex model of group task's four quadrants, which are categorized based on the dominant performance process involved in a group's task of interest.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Breakdown ===
The four quadrants are as follows: 
# '''''Generating''' ideas or plans''
# '''''Choosing''' a solution''
# '''''Negotiating''' a solution to a conflict'' 
# '''''Executing''' a task''

To further differentiate the various goal-related group activities, McGrath further sub-divides these four categories, resulting in eight categories in total. The breakdown of these categories is as follows:

1. &lt;u&gt;'''''Generating''' ideas or plans''&lt;/u&gt;
* '''''&lt;u&gt;Type 1&lt;/u&gt;''' – Planning tasks''
** E.g. Generating plans
* '''''&lt;u&gt;Type 2&lt;/u&gt;''' – Creativity tasks''
** E.g. Generating ideas
2. ''&lt;u&gt;'''Choosing''' a solution&lt;/u&gt;''
* '''''&lt;u&gt;Type 3&lt;/u&gt;''' – Intellective tasks''
** E.g. Solving problems with correct answers
* '''''&lt;u&gt;Type 4&lt;/u&gt;''' – Decision-making tasks''
** E.g. Deciding issues with no right answer
3. ''&lt;u&gt;'''Negotiating''' a solution to a conflict&lt;/u&gt;'' 
* '''''&lt;u&gt;Type 5&lt;/u&gt;''' – Cognitive conflict tasks''
** E.g. Resolving conflicts of viewpoints 
* '''''&lt;u&gt;Type 6&lt;/u&gt;''' – Mixed-motive tasks''
** E.g. Resolving conflicts of interest 
4. ''&lt;u&gt;'''Executing''' a task&lt;/u&gt;'' 
* '''''&lt;u&gt;Type 7&lt;/u&gt;''' – Contests/battles/competitive tasks''
** E.g. Resolving conflicts of power 
* '''''&lt;u&gt;Type 8&lt;/u&gt;''' – Performance/psychomotor tasks''
** E.g. Executing performance tasks

=== Details ===
According to [[Joseph E. McGrath|McGrath]] and [[Kravitz]] (1982),&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; the four most commonly represented tasks in the group dynamics literature are intellective tasks, decision-making tasks, cognitive conflict tasks and mixed-motive tasks.

The circumplex model of group tasks takes the organization of goal-related activities a step further by distinguishing between tasks that involve cooperation between group members, cooperation tasks (Types 1, 2, 3 and 8) and tasks that often lead to conflict between group members, conflict tasks (Types 4, 5, 6 and 7).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Additionally, McGrath's circumplex model of group tasks also distinguishes between tasks that require action (behavioural tasks) and tasks that require conceptual review (conceptual tasks). 'Behavioural tasks' include Types 1, 6, 7 and 8, while 'conceptual tasks' include Types 2, 3, 4 and 5.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Visual representation ==
The circumplex model of group tasks is, evidently, a very detailed and complex model. To allow for a more thorough understanding of its properties, a visual representation of the model has been developed. (Need a diagram of the model)

== Further explanation ==
Since the circumplex model of group tasks is quite detailed and complex, numerous social psychological researchers have attempted to describe the model in various ways to ensure readers obtain an optimal understanding of the model. For instance, according to Stratus and McGrath (1994),&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal
| last = Straus
| first = Susan G.
| last2 = McGrath
| first2 = Joseph E.

| access-date = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; the four quadrants and the various task types with which they contain all relate to one another within a two-dimensional space. More specifically, [[Susan G. Stratus|Stratus]] and [[Joseph E. McGrath|McGrath]] (1994)&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; states that the horizontal dimension of the circumplex model of group tasks visual representation reflect the extent to which a task entails cognitive versus behavioural performance requirements. Likewise, the vertical dimension of the circumplex model of group tasks visual representation reflects the extent and form of interdependence among members.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
