'''Back in Time''' is an education book app for [[iOS]] about the history of the universe, earth, life and mankind that uses a time analogy to explain different timescales.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/app/id450345693|title=Back in Time|last=LANDKA|first=|date=|website=App Store|language=en-US|isbn=978-989-97421-0-9|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Released in September 22, 2011, it was developed by the software company Landka in collaboration with scientific institutions such as [[European Space Agency|ESA]]/[[Hubble Space Telescope]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.spacetelescope.org/announcements/ann1202/|title=Educational App with ESA/Hubble Content in New York Times Top 10 Best iPad Apps|last=Usher|first=Oli|date=|website=Hubble Space Telescope {{!}} ESA|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=2012-01-18|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The app was featured worldwide in the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] and rapidly became a success, reaching the top sales of iPad book apps in 38 countries.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.publico.pt/2012/01/24/p3/noticia/esta-app-portuguesa-foi-a-mais-vendida-em-38-paises-1812886|title=Portuguese app reaches top sales in 38 countries|last=Coentrão|first=Abel|date=2012-01-24|work=PÚBLICO|access-date=|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://expresso.sapo.pt/sociedade/iappi-portuguesa-no-top-de-vendas-dos-eua-video=f698824#gs.yx_E6sU|title=Portuguese app in the US top sales|last=|first=|date=2012-10-01|work=Jornal Expresso|access-date=|language=pt-PT}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Back in Time'' was distinguished by [[The New York Times|''The New York Times'']] and selected for the top 10 apps of the year.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/05/technology/personaltech/amid-an-avalanche-of-ipad-apps-the-best-of-2011-app-smart.html?_r=0|title=iPad Apps - the Best of 2011 - App Smart|last=|first=|date=2012-01-05|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; In 2012 it was recognized with a [[World Summit Awards|World Summit Award]] ([[United Nations|UN]] based initiative).&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldsummitawards.org/winner/back-in-time/|title=Back in Time {{!}} WSA 2012 Winners|last=|first=|date=|website=World Summit Awards|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==
''Back in Time'' is a cross between a history textbook and a multimedia encyclopedia. The app presents 50 key events since the beginning of the universe until the present day covering different timescales such as the [[chronology of the universe]], the [[Geological history of Earth|geological history of earth]], the [[evolutionary history of life]] and [[History of the world|human history]].&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.commonsensemedia.org/app-reviews/back-in-time|title=Back in Time - App Review|last=Panarelli|first=Liz|date=|work=Common Sense Media|access-date=2018-10-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2011/10/back-in-time-for-ipad-see-the-history-of-the-universe-in-24-hours/|title=Back In Time For iPad: See The History Of The Universe In 24 Hours|last=Chan|first=Casey|date=2011-10-06|work=Gizmodo|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to better understand these timescales, the app proposes a time analogy where the entire [[age of the universe]] (13.7 billion years) is scaled into a 24-hour clock. Navigation is possible by browsing several timelines or by rewinding the pointers of a clock to go back in time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The text of each chapter is complemented with images, videos, interactive timelines, animations and trivia. The app's soundtrack was produced by [[Rodrigo Leão]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Time analogy ==
''Back in Time'' presents the most relevant events in history using a 24-hour clock as a time analogy. This analogy scales the entire [[age of the universe]] (13.7 billion years) into a single day (24 hours) so that the beginning of the universe (Big Bang) started at 0:00h and at present time the imaginary clock reads 24:00h. ''Back in Time'' uses this analogy as a method to visualize and compare key events in the [[Chronology of the universe|history of the universe]], of [[History of Earth|earth]], [[Evolutionary history of life|life]], and [[History of the world|human history]]. This analogy was originally proposed by Astronomer Bob Lambert from the [[:it:Osservatorio_John_J._McCarthy|John J. McCarthy Observatory]] as a tool for helping students visualizing large timescales.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Bilingual education''' involves teaching academic content in two languages, in a native and secondary language with varying amounts of each language used in accordance with the program model.Bilingual education refers to the utilization of two languages as means of instruction for students and considered part of or the entire school curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ascd.org/publications/curriculum_handbook/413/chapters/Bilingual_Education@_Effective_Programming_for_Language-Minority_Students.aspx|title=Bilingual Education: Effective Programming for Language-Minority Students|last=ASCD|website=ascd.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bilingual education program models==
The following are several different types of bilingual education program models:
*[[Transitional bilingual education|Transitional Bilingual Education]]. This involves education in a child's native language, typically for no more than three years, to ensure that students do not fall behind in content areas like mathematics, science, and social studies while they are learning English. Research has shown that many of the skills learned in the native language can be transferred easily to the second language later. The goal is to help students transition to mainstream, English-only classrooms as quickly as possible, and the linguistic goal of such programs is English acquisition only. In a transitional bilingual program, the student's primary language is used as a vehicle to develop literacy skills and acquire academic knowledge. It is used to develop literacy and academic skills in the primary language
* '''Two-Way''' or '''Dual Language Immersion''' Bilingual Education. Dual Language or Two-Way Immersion education refers to programs that provide grade-level content and literacy instruction to all students through two languages, English and a partner language. These programs are designed to help native and non-native English speakers become bilingual and biliterate. There are four main types of dual language programs, these programs refer to how a student would best learn with Dual Language Immersion based on their previous language skills.
**'''Developmental, or maintenance bilingual programs.''' These programs enroll students who are native speakers of the partner language to learn English.
**'''Bilingual immersion programs.''' This program enrolls both native English speaker and native speakers of the partner language.
**'''Foreign language Immersion.''' This program primarily enrolls students who speak English as their native language.
**'''Heritage language programs.''' These programs enroll students who primarily dominant in english, but a close relative (parents, grandparents) speak the partner language.
**There are two basic models for Dual Language Immersion The first model is '''90/10 model'''. The two-way bilingual immersion program has 90% of the instructions in grade K-1 in minority language which is less supported by the broader society and 10% in the majority language . This proportion gradually changes in the majority language until the curriculum is equally divided in both languages by 5th grade.  The two-way bilingual immersion program is based on the principle of clear curriculum separation of the two languages of instruction. Teachers do not repeat or translate the subject matter in second language but strengthen concepts taught in one language across the two languages in a spiral curriculum in order to provide cognitive challenge(Thomas &amp; Collier. 1997). The languages of instructions are alternated by theme or content area.  This type of immersion is required to develop the dual language proficiency, as social language can be mastered in couple of years, but a higher level of competency is required to read social studies texts or solve mathematics word problems, roughly around 5 to 7 years (Collier, 1987). The goal of gradually increasing the majority of the language is for instruction to become 50% of English and 50% of the partner language. The second model is the '''50/50 model'''. In the 50/50 model English and the partner language are used equally throughout the program.

The United States Congress introduced the Bilingual Act in 1968 defining bilingual education’s term program. This program of instruction is intended for children who are not fully proficient in the English language. Instructions are given so pupils can achieve the necessary competence in English as well as their native languages taking into consideration the children’s cultural heritage. This could be integrated into the subjects or courses of study enabling the students to grow effectively throughout the educational system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://education.uslegal.com/bilingualism/landmark-legislation/bilingual-education-act-1968/|title=Bilingual Education Act (1968) – Education|last=Inc.|first=US Legal|website=education.uslegal.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (1968) was another meaningful measure for bilingual education. Title VII (Bilingual Education Act) created federal guidelines for bilingual education. The decree recognized the “''Special educational needs of the large numbers children of limited English-speaking ability in the United States''.” Said Enactment specified the federal government’s obligation to provide subsidy for creative bilingual programs. Title VII was amended many times since its introduction. The decree became part of the America Schools Act in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://study.com/academy/lesson/transitional-bilingual-education-programs-pros-cons.html|title=Transitional Bilingual Education Programs: Pros &amp; Cons {{!}} Study.com|work=Study.com|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dual Immersion classrooms encourage students but with the permission it may be enthusiastic &amp;' native language development, making an important contribution to heritage language maintenance and allows language minority students to remain in classrooms with their native English-speaking peers, resulting in linguistic and socio-cultural advantages (Christian, 1996b). As of May 2005, there were 317 dual immersion programs operating in elementary schools in the United States in 10 different languages(Center for Applied Linguistics, 2005).

Dual Language programs are less common in US schools, although research indicates they are extremely effective in helping students learn English well and aiding the long-term performance of English learners in school. Native English speakers benefit by learning a second language. English language learners (ELLs) are not segregated from their peers.&lt;ref&gt;(Center for Applied Linguistics, 2005; Thomas &amp; Collier, 1997; Lindholm-Leary, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; These students are taught in their mother tongue yet still in the typical 'American' classroom they need to be in, for both cognitive and social benefits. 
* Another form of Bilingual Education is a type of '''Dual Language''' program that has students study in two different ways: 1) A variety of academic subjects are taught in the students' second language, with specially trained bilingual teachers who can understand students when they ask questions in their native language, but always answer in the second language; and 2) Native language literacy classes improve students' writing and higher-order language skills in their first language. Research has shown that many of the skills learned in the native language can be transferred easily to the second language later. In this type of program, the native language classes do not teach academic subjects. The second-language classes are content-based, rather than grammar-based, so students learn all of their academic subjects in the second language.&lt;ref name="What is Dual Language Education"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dlenm.org/what-is-dual-language-education.aspx|title=What is Dual Language Education?|website=dlenm.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dual language is a type of bilingual education where students learn about reading and writing in two languages. In the United States, majority of programs are English and Spanish but new partner languages have emerged lately such as Japanese, Korean, French, Mandarin, and Arabic. The concept of Dual Language promotes bilingualism, improved awareness of cultural diversity, and higher levels of academic achievement by means of lessons in two languages.&lt;ref name="What is Dual Language Education"/&gt; 
* '''Late-Exit''' or '''Developmental''' Bilingual Education. Education is in the child's native language for an extended duration, accompanied by education in English. The goal is to develop literacy in the child's native language first, and transfer these skills to the second language. This education is ideal for many English learning students, but in many instances the resources for such education are not available.

==Myths surrounding bilingual education==
Many myths and much prejudice has grown around bilingual education. Researchers from the UK and Poland have listed the most entrenched misconceptions:&lt;ref name="ParadowskiBator2016"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Paradowski MB, Bator A |title=Perceived effectiveness of language acquisition in the process of multilingual upbringing by parents of different nationalities  |journal=International Journal of Bilingual Education and Bilingualism |volume=21  |issue=6  |pages=1–19 |year=2016 |doi=10.1080/13670050.2016.1203858}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* bi- or multilinguals are exceptions to the ‘default’ monolingual ‘norm’;
* in order to deserve the label ‘bi-/multilingual’, one needs to have an equal, ‘perfect’, ‘nativelike’ command of both/all her/his languages;
* childhood bilingualism may be detrimental to both linguistic and cognitive development and consequently lead to poorer results at school;
* exposing a child to more than one tongue may cause language impairment or deficits, or that for children already diagnosed with impairments two languages mean too much unnecessary pressure and effort;
*children do not have enough time to learn both languages, therefore it is better if they only acquire the majority language.

These are all harmful convictions which have long been debunked,&lt;ref name="ParadowskiBator2016"/&gt; yet still persist among many parents. It is important to understand what constitutes the decision for sending children to a bilingual school. The decision should be based on, appropriate age, curriculum, and the preference of the child.&lt;ref name="biling"&gt;{{cite web|last=Racoma|first=Bernadine|title=The Pros and Cons of Sending Your Kids to a Bilingual School|url=https://www.daytranslations.com/blog/2014/03/the-pros-and-cons-of-sending-your-kids-to-a-bilingual-school-3924|website=Day Translations|date=2014-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|date=June 2017|certain=y}}

In spite of these myths surrounding language education, there are numerous significant benefits to a child's development when exposed to secondary language education. The American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages has identified over twenty benefits to a child's development when provided adequate secondary language education, therefore debunking the vast majority of myths that may inhibit such education &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Crane |first1=John |title=When Will Public Elementary Schools in the US Finally Start Teaching Foreign Languages? |url=https://medium.com/@jcrane1/when-will-public-elementary-schools-in-the-us-finally-start-teaching-foreign-languages-6cbc2716161b |website=Medium.com |accessdate=16 November 2018|date=2018-09-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==By country or region==

===Africa===
In the African region, Countries such as Mozambique have taken the lead in bilingual education. The Ministry of Education and Human Development has made primary education fully bilingual in 2017. Children will be taught 16 Mozambican dialects during their early years of schooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201503190228.html|title=Mozambique: Fully Bilingual Primary Education as From 2017|date=2015-03-19|work=Agencia de Informacao de Mocambique (Maputo)|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many African states introduce mother languages as subjects and education tools along commonly spoken international or foreign languages. Mother language instruction is terminated immediately during the schooling cycle and leaves only the international language established. It becomes a disadvantage that contributes to substantial lack of motivation on the part of teachers, students, and parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.globalpartnership.org/blog/mother-language-education-africa|title=Mother language education in Africa|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{expand section|date=May 2016|1=e.g., [https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-0-387-30424-3_122], [http://www.edqual.org/publications/published-research/clegg07.pdf.1], [http://www.praesa.org.za/files/2012/07/Paper6.pdf], [https://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/sites/teacheng/files/C413%20Juba%20Publication_FINAL_WEB%20ONLY%20v3.pdf], [https://books.google.com/books?id=FMoWyso1vuQC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=bilingual+education+africa&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwik4vGxwrfMAhWjIqYKHYA0B58Q6AEIIzAA], [https://books.google.com/books?id=D6iIlllyNCEC&amp;pg=PA171&amp;dq=bilingual+education+africa&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwik4vGxwrfMAhWjIqYKHYA0B58Q6AEIRTAG], etc.}}

====Senegal====
Although bilingual schools exist, the majority of Senegalese schools teach in French and follow the French system. However, studies have shown that approximately 80% of teachers use a 'local language' in order to communicate with all of their students.&lt;ref name="World Data on Education, Senegal"&gt;United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization. International Bureau of Education. [http://www.ibe.unesco.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Publications/WDE/2010/pdf-versions/Senegal.pdf "World Data on Education, Senegal"]. UNESCO-IBE, 2010. Web. (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===
[[Asia]] is the [[Earth|Earth's]] largest and most populous [[continent]], located primarily in the [[Eastern Hemisphere|eastern]] and [[northern hemisphere]]s. It includes a large number of countries, some of which are grouped into subregions.

====China====
In the [[Autonomous regions of China]] many children of the country's major ethnic minorities attend public schools where the medium of instructions is the local language, such as e.g. [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]] or [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]]. Traditionally, the textbooks there were little different from merely a translated version of the books used in the Chinese schools throughout the country; however, as of 2001, a move was on foot to create more teaching materials with locally based content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|

|publisher= Springer|year= 2004
|isbn= 978-1-4020-8038-8|pages =119–120}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Classes of [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] as second language are also offered in these minority schools, and the central government makes increasing efforts to make them more effective. A law passed in February 2001 provided for the Mandarin-as-second-language classes in the ethnic-minority schools to start in the early years of elementary school whenever local conditions permit, rather than in the senior years of elementary school, as it was practiced before.&lt;ref&gt;Zhou (2004), pp. 119-120&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, it has been reported that Chinese has been used as the medium of instructions in some [[Autonomous county|autonomous counties]] even though less than 50% of the population "spoke and understood some Chinese"; this mismatch was thought to have contributed to the low grades earned by the students on the math and Chinese exams.&lt;ref&gt;Zhou (2004), p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Hong Kong =====
In [[Hong Kong]] where both [[English language|English]] and [[Cantonese]] are official, both languages are taught in school and are mandatory subjects. Either English or Cantonese is used as the medium of instruction for other subjects. Increasingly, there are a large number of [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]]-speaking schools in operation throughout Hong Kong as well since 1996. Study of Mandarin is mandatory in junior years (from Grade 1 to Grade 9). Hong Kong also has a bilingual education program using both Cantonese and Hong Kong Sign Language.

=====Macao=====
Chinese and Portuguese are the official languages of [[Macau]], but English plays an unofficial and highly prominent role. English is the language of instruction at the University of Macau and at some secondary schools. Other schools use Cantonese as the language of instruction. {{as of|2013}} there was one Portuguese-medium school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.languageonthemove.com/multilingual-macau/|title=Multilingual Macau|date=April 22, 2013|publisher=languageonthemove.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Japan====
{{More citations needed|date=March 2007}}
In Japan, the need for bilingualism (mostly Japanese and English) has been pointed out, and there are some scholars who advocate teaching children subjects such as mathematics using English rather than Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://japansociology.com/2013/06/08/bilingual-education-in-japan/|title=Bilingual Education in Japan|date=2013-06-08|work=JAPANsociology|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of this proposal, subjects such as history, however, would be taught solely in Japanese.

On the island of [[Hokkaido]], the indigenous and endangered [[Ainu language]] is receiving newfound interest with establishment of a small number of bilingual Ainu-Japanese elementary schools.

The largest non-Japanese, non-native to Japan minority are the [[Koreans in Japan|Koreans]]. Bilingual education in [[Korean language]] is provided by Korean international schools, more of which are affiliated with [[Chongryon]].

====Middle East====

=====The Arab World=====
Schools in the [[Middle East]] follow dual or triple language programmes.  The triple language programme is most commonly found in [[Lebanon]], [[Tunisia]], [[Syria]], and often implemented as well in [[Egypt]].  History, grammar, literature and the [[Arabic language]] are taught in the native language (Arabic), whereas Mathematics and sciences are generally taught in English and/or French.  In Lebanon, however, science and mathematics are taught in either French or English, depending on the school's administration or the grade level.  It is not uncommon to find French- or English- only schools, though usually these institutions are primarily international establishments.

In most [[Gulf countries]] as well as [[Jordan]], English is introduced as a second language early on alongside the primary medium of instruction, Arabic.  In [[Iraq]] however, triple language programmes are, like in Lebanon and Syria, normal, except rather than using French, [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] is taught alongside Arabic and English due to Iraq's considerably sized Kurdish minority in the north, and bilingual official language policy regarding Kurdish.

In [[Morocco]], [[Berber languages|Berber]] can be used as a regional medium of elementary education, with widespread use of French and Arabic in higher grades. Due to Morocco's history of French colonialism, sole French-medium education is very widespread.

=====Israel=====
Normally, Israelis are taught in either Hebrew or Arabic depending on religion and ethnicity. Within the standard education system, thorough study of English is compulsory, and depending on the primary medium of education, Arabic or Hebrew are introduced as third languages with significantly lesser emphasis placed on achieving solid proficiency.  Within Hebrew-medium programmes, other foreign languages such as French, German, Russian, or Yiddish can often be studied as well.

Israel is also home to several international schools whereby the sole medium of education is either [[English language|English]] or [[French language|French]]. In general, as English is taught early on across all Israeli schools, most Israelis become comfortably bilingual, much like what one would see in The Netherlands or Scandinavian countries. This in combination with a large proportion of English-language programming on television that is merely subtitled and seldom dubbed.

Recent peace initiatives have also led to a small number of bilingual and multi-religious schools in which both Hebrew and Arabic are used in equal emphasis.  The [[Hand in Hand: Center for Jewish Arab Education in Israel]] runs four bilingual schools, and the [[Neve Shalom]] peace village also hosts a local school.

====Mongolia====
There has been long standing encouragement to teach at least one other language other than Mongolian. Traditionally [[Russian language]] was taught during middle school and high school. After the 1990 transition to democracy, English language has been gaining more ground in Mongolian schools. Today many public schools at all levels teach one other language that are usually English, Russian, Korean, Japanese or Chinese. Although the core curriculum is in Mongolian, it is generally encouraged by the government and the public that the students should have some command of a secondary language when they graduate from high school. Also there are other private schools that teach their curricula in English.

====South Asia====
[[South Asia]] is the [[south]]ern [[region]] of the [[Asia]]n [[continent]], comprising the [[Himalayas|sub-Himalayan]] [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]] (SAARC) countries and, [[#Definition by South Asian Studies programs|for some authorities]], adjoining countries to the west and east.

=====Bangladesh=====
In Bangladesh, Bengali is the first language. However, it has a colonial past and English is widely used in administrations, schools, courts etc. Bangladeshi children start English as Second Language quite early in their age (mostly from age 5-6). In National Curriculum, English is given an importance and it is taught compulsorily until twelfth grade. There are Government approved curriculum as well as other international systems of Educations which maintains English as a 'medium of instruction'.

=====India=====
{{Main|Bilingualism in India}}
The official languages of the Union of [[India]] are [[Hindi]] and English, with 21 other regional languages holding co-official status, including: [[Assamese language|Assamese]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Bodo language|Bodo]], [[Dogri]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Kannada]], [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]], [[Konkani language|Konkani]], [[Maithili language|Maithili]], [[Malayalam]], [[Meitei language|Manipuri]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Nepali language|Nepali]], [[Odia language|Odia]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Sanskrit]], [[Santali language|Santali]], [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]] and [[Urdu]].

Education in India follows the [[Three-language formula]], where children are to be taught English (or the medium of instruction in the school, grades 1-12), The Second Language (grades 1-10) is the Official language of the state (In most non-Hindi states) or Hindi (in the others), in a few states some schools offer a choice between the State Language and Hindi, and the third language (grades 5-8, often Hindi (in the non-Hindi states), the regional language of the state (if the student opted for Hindi as the second language,  a foreign language or Sanskrit). An exception is [[Tamil Nadu]] where only [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and English are taught.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

English-medium schools often find favour with parents, especially in urban areas, due to English's international prestige, India's Colonial heritage, its usage in Indian business and it being the medium of instruction in most Indian universities.

=====Philippines=====
In July 2009 [[Department of Education (Philippines)|Department of Education]] moved towards [[Education in the Philippines#Breakdown of the Program|mother-tongue based learning]] initially by issuing an order which allowed two alternative three-year bridging plans. Depending on the bridging plan adopted, the Filipino and English languages are to be phased in as the language of instruction beginning in the third and fourth grades.&lt;ref&gt;.

In 2007, President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] signed a directive in Spain that would reintroduce teaching and learning the Spanish language in the Philippine school system starting in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://getrealphilippines.com/blog/2012/07/re-introduction-of-spanish-mandated-by-arroyo-in-2007-trumpeted-by-bs-aquino-today/|title=Re-introduction of Spanish mandated by Arroyo in 2007, trumpeted by BS Aquino today|date=July 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The order, Memorandum Order No. 276, s. 2007, issued on November 29, 2007, ordered the Department of Education to encourage the teaching and learning of the Spanish language throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ph/2007/11/29/memorandum-order-no-276-s-2007/|title= Memorandum Order No. 276, s. 2007|date=November 29, 2007|work=Official Gazette|publisher=Government of the Philippines}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Singapore=====
In Singapore, education is bilingual. The medium of instruction is in English and the learning of the mother tongue is compulsory. The mother tongue subject is usually [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Malay language|Malay]] or [[Tamil language|Tamil]], the other official languages of Singapore. They are taught till pre-university level. Previously, students either attended an English-medium or a "vernacular school", which taught in one of the mother tongues. In 1960, government legislation standardised the primary medium of instruction to English, with the different vernacular languages ("mother tongue") allocated as the second language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Development of Education in Singapore since 1965|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EDUCATION/Resources/278200-1121703274255/1439264-1153425508901/Development_Edu_Singapore_draft.pdf |accessdate=29 November 2012 |work= Associate Professor Goh Chor Boon and Professor S. Gopinathan|publisher=National Institute of Education | date=June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students may also choose to learn a third language (German, French, Japanese, etc.) in secondary school and junior college or, if their respective school does not offer the language, at a [[Ministry of Education (Singapore)|MOE]] Language Centre. This option is limited however, to the top 10% of any PSLE cohort; prospective third language students must have also scored A grades for English and their second language. Singaporean students returning from abroad who did not learn a second language may be exempted from their mother tongue and learn another second language in place of the mother tongue; however, such exemptions are rare and only granted on a case-to-case basis.

=====Thailand and Malaysia=====
Since the mid-1990s bilingual approaches to schooling and higher education have become popular in parts of [[South-east Asia]], especially in [[Thailand]] and [[Malaysia]] where different models have been applied, from L2 immersion (content taught in a non-native language) to parallel immersion, where core subjects are taught in both the mother-tongue and a second language (usually English).

English has been taught in schools in Malaysia as it is a [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] country (former British colony). During the 1980s to 1990s, when schools were nationalised under the government of Prime Minister [[Mahathir Mohamad]], English became a second language instead of the primary language of instruction. The Malaysian government reversed its decision to have Maths and Science taught in English, but is implementing different programmes designed to improve English language teaching within schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Malaysia drops English language teaching|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/10/malaysia-tefl|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=10 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision has raised numerous debates, with various groups arguing for and against the use of English in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The sad state of English in Malaysia|url=http://news.asiaone.com/news/malaysia/sad-state-english-malaysia|publisher=[[AsiaOne]]|work=[[The Straits Times]]|date=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the existence of vernacular schools and prominent usage of dialects, some Chinese and Indian children become trilingual, speaking Malay, English and their mother tongue or dialect. However, English is still widely spoken as a [[de facto]] language of trade and academia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Child Language Development in Singapore and Malaysia|chapter=The Malaysian Sociolinguistic Situation:An Overview|page=7|first1=Irene F.H.|last1=Wong|first2=Henry|last2=Thambyrajah|editor-first=Anna|editor-last=Kwan-Terry|date=1991|publisher=[[NUS Press|Singapore University Press]]|isbn=9789971691493}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The difficulties and disputes characteristic of the US experience have not been replicated in these Asian countries, though they are not without controversy.  Generally, it can be said that there is widespread acknowledgment of the need to improve English competence in the population, and bilingual approaches, where language is taught through subject content, are seen to be the most effective means of attaining this.  The most significant limiting factors are the shortage of teachers linguistically competent to teach in a second language and the costs involved in use of expatriate native speakers for this purpose.

===Australia===
In [[Australia]], some schools teach bilingual programs which cater to children speaking languages other than English. Baldauf&lt;ref&gt;(2005)&lt;/ref&gt; explains that these programs are now beginning to benefit from more government support. Bilingual education for Indigenous students, however, has only received intermittent official backing. In the Northern Territory, for example, bilingual programs for Indigenous students begun with Federal Government support in the early 1970s, but by December 1998 the Northern Territory Government had announced its decision to shift $3 million away from the 29 bilingual programs to a Territory-wide program teaching English as a second language. Within 12 months though the government had softened its position. Most bilingual programs were allowed to continue under the guise of two-way education. Then on 24 August 2005, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training announced that the government would be "revitalizing bi-lingual education" at 15 Community Education Centres: [[Alekerange, Northern Territory|Alekerange]], [[Angurugu, Northern Territory|Angurugu]], [[Borroloola, Northern Territory|Borroloola]], [[Gapuwiyak, Northern Territory|Gapuwiyak]], [[Gunbalanya, Northern Territory|Gunbalanya]], [[Kalkaringi, Northern Territory|Kalkaringi]], [[Lajamanu, Northern Territory|Lajamanu]], [[Maningrida, Northern Territory|Maningrida]], [[Milingimbi Island|Milingimbi]], [[Ramingining, Northern Territory|Ramingining]], [[Ngkurr, Northern Territory|Ngkurr]], Shepherdson College, [[Numbulwar, Northern Territory|Numbulwar]], [[Yirrkala, Northern Territory|Yirrkala]] and [[Yuendumu, Northern Territory|Yuendumu]]. This revitalisation is conceived as part of an effort aimed at "providing effective education from pre-school through to senior secondary at each of the Territory's 15 Community Education Centres". As Harris &amp; Devlin (1986) observe, "Aboriginal bilingual education in Australia represents much more than a range of education programs. It has been a measure of non-Aboriginal commitment to either assimilation or cultural pluralism". In 2008 it again shifted with the government attempting to force the nine remaining bilingual schools to teach the first four hours of classes in English.

===Europe===
The ''[[European Schools]]'' group is a network of thirteen private schools in EU countries that provide multilingual and multicultural education at nursery, primary and secondary levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Locations of the European Schools |url=https://www.eursc.eu/en/European-Schools/locations |website=Office of the Secretary-General of the European Schools |accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Organisation of studies |url=https://www.eursc.eu/en/European-Schools/studies/studies-organisation |website=Office of the Secretary-General of the European Schools |accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Belgium====
[[Belgium]] has three official languages: [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]]. The constitution guarantees free education, so private schools can use any language, but state(-recognised) schools teach in the language of the language area where it is located. For [[Brussels]], which is an officially bilingual French-Dutch area, schools use either Dutch or French as medium.

Even though Belgium has two major languages (Dutch in Flanders, and French in Wallonia), bilingual instruction does rarely occur since Belgian law only permits education in one official language. In Flanders, bilingual instruction is only allowed as a short-term project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Agirdag|first=Orhan|title=Exploring bilingualism in a monolingual school system: insights from Turkish and native students from Belgian schools|journal=British Journal of Sociology of Education|date=1 May 2010|volume=31|issue=3|pages=307–321|doi=10.1080/01425691003700540|url=https://ugent.academia.edu/OrhanAgirdag/Papers/202294/Exploring_Bilingualism_In_a_Monolingual_School_System_Insights_From_Turkish_and_Native_Students_From_Belgian_Schools}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====France====
{{See also|Language policy in France}}
[[France]] has one official language, [[French language|French]]. However, regional provincial languages including [[Corsican language|Corsican]], [[Breton language|Breton]], [[Gallo language|Gallo]], [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Franco-Provençal language|Franco-Provençal]], [[Occitan language|Occitan]], and [[Catalan language|Catalan]] have charter protection, and bilingual education programmes and regional language course electives have been established. However, due to the strict French-language policy imposed by national government, there is no centrally allocated funding for any of these programmes. All funding is at the municipal level, with many of the regional languages face extreme endangerment. France is known for wanting to maintain its lingual and cultural roots, and speaking a language other than French or mixing French with other languages is looked down on. This is apparent the French educational system, where French is highly prioritized over other languages and emphasis is put not only on the maintenance of the French language, but also on pushing students not to integrate French with other languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Costa|first=James|date=6 Mar 2010|title=France and Language (s): Old Policies and New Challenges in Education.

====Netherlands====
In the [[Netherlands]], there are around 100 bilingual schools. In these schools, the first language is Dutch, whereas the second language is usually English and occasionally German. In the province of [[Friesland]], where [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]] is an official language, some primary schools are trilingual, teaching in Dutch, West Frisian, and English. Most bilingual secondary schools are TVWO (Bilingual Preparatory Scientific Education), but THAVO (Bilingual Higher General Secondary Education) and TVMBO-TL (Bilingual Preparatory Vocational Education - Theoretical Learning Pathway)&lt;ref&gt;TVMBO-TL was recently introduced at O.R.S.

====Republic of Ireland====
The Republic of Ireland has two official languages, [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[English language|English]]. With the [[Irish language]] facing endangerment, as well as the presence of regions where Irish is still spoken as native (referred to as the [[Gaeltacht]]), the [[Irish constitution]] protects and reserves the right for education to be established through the medium of either official language, and it thus is.

An Irish-medium school is referred to as [[Gaelscoil]] (plural, Gaelscoileanna) This movement has been met with some success in that 10% of the schooling in Ireland is conducted in Irish. The movement has also been successful in setting up schools in both urban and rural areas, ranging from Dublin and Cork, to the traditional Gaeltacht regions.

====Spain====

=====Andalusia=====
In [[Andalusia]] (Spain's second southernmost region), things have changed drastically concerning bilingual education since the introduction of the Plurilingualism Promotion Plan by the autonomous government. The plan was born as the realization for the Andalusian territory of the European language policies regarding the teaching and learning of languages. With special strength in the past ten years bilingual education has worked at most elementary schools.

In addition to this new European scene, the Scheme for the Promotion of Plurilingualism has learned a lot from the first experimental bilingual sections set up in some schools by the Andalusian government in 1998. Following the content-based approach, French and German were used to partly teach other subjects. This successful experience, as show the international tests that the students have been given, is the starting point for a more ambitious scene, where 400 schools will be involved in the next four years, more languages, especially English, will take part, and a lot of investigation and implementation of the Integrated Curriculum of languages must be carried out.

Being aware of the necessity of the Andalusian people to adapt to the new scenario, a major government plan, called "strategies for the second modernization of Andalusia", was designed in 2003. The document also underlined language diversity as a source of richness and a valuable heritage of humankind which needs to be looked after.

It was then clear that a scheme was needed to carry out this new language policy in the territory, especially affecting education, with clear goals, timing and funding.

The scheme is to be developed through five major programmes and also an organization and assessment plan.

The programmes are:
*Bilingual schools
*Official Schools of Languages
*Plurilingualism and teachers
*Plurilingualism and society
*Organization and assessment plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juntadeandalucia.es/averroes/plurilinguismo/planing.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205105956/http://www.juntadeandalucia.es/averroes/plurilinguismo/planing.pdf|archive-date=2009-02-05|title=Plurilingualism Promotion Plan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Basque Country, Navarre, Galicia, Catalonia, Valencia and the Balearic Islands=====
In addition to [[Castilian Spanish]] being the primary [[official language]] of [[Spain]], the kingdom also has several co-official regional languages which enjoy equal and unbiased constitutional protection and promotion: [[Catalan language|Catalan/Valencian]] (in [[Catalonia]], [[Valencian Community|Valencia]] and the [[Balearic Islands]]), [[Galician language|Galician]] (in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]), [[Basque language|Basque]] (in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] and the northern zone of [[Navarre]]) and [[Aranese]] (in [[Val d'Aran]], [[Catalonia]]).

Many schools are bilingual in the regional language as well as Castilian at both the elementary and secondary levels. Regional universities also often provide programmes through the regional medium. Education in all co-official languages uses to receive both national and regional funding.

Unlike [[France]] in which regional languages face incredible endangerment and possible extinction, Spain's long-established approach to making regional bilingual education mandatory has served often as a model for both the survival and thriving state of the languages indigenous to the country.

====Sweden====
[[Sweden]] has one official language and five recognized minority languages,&lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M. (2004). Planning for multilingualism and minority language rights in Sweden. ''Language Policy, 3''(2), 181-201.&lt;/ref&gt; though [[Swedish language|Swedish]] is to great extent the only one of these in which education is offered. During the 21st century more and more schools started to offer national programs in [[English language|English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Agirdag|first=Orhan|title=The International School Consultancy Group|url=http://www.iscresearch.com/information/isc-news.aspx|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000123/http://www.iscresearch.com/information/isc-news.aspx|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom and dependencies====
The British Isles have several indigenous languages apart from [[English language|English]]. These include [[Welsh language|Welsh]] (official in Wales), [[Irish Language|Irish]], [[Manx Gaelic]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]], [[Scottish Gaelic]], and the [[Scots language]] (which is sometimes considered as a dialect of English).

[[Scotland]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Wales]], [[Cornwall]], and the [[Isle of Man]] have each established bilingual programmes which provide education through the medium of their indigenous language. Most often, except for the cases of Manx and Cornish, these programmes exist where the language is spoken communally as a first language.

=====Wales=====
Roughly a quarter of schoolchildren in Wales now receive their education through the [[Welsh medium education|medium of Welsh]], and children wishing to join a Welsh medium school ({{Lang-cy|ysgol Gymraeg}}) do not have to speak Welsh to go to one if they are young enough to learn the language quickly. Welsh medium education has met with great success across Wales since the first such schools opened in the 1940s. There are current plans to extend further provision in urban centres such as [[Cardiff]], [[Newport, Wales|Newport]], [[Swansea]] and [[Llanelli]] to cater for growing demand; this has caused controversy in some areas.

Welsh-speaking areas use Welsh-medium education almost exclusively. Parents have a legal right for their children to receive education in Welsh, and each local authority caters for this. In the Western flank of Wales, [[Carmarthenshire]], [[Ceredigion]], [[Gwynedd]] and [[Anglesey]], most primary and secondary schools are Welsh medium or have bilingual streams. Some 75-80% of all pupils in [[Carmarthenshire]] and [[Ceredigion]] receive their education through the medium of Welsh, with this figure increasing in Gwynedd to around 90%.

In English-medium schools, the study of Welsh is compulsory and must be taught from age 5 to age 16 in all state-funded schools.

=====Northern Ireland=====
Irish Gaelic received official recognition in Northern Ireland for the first time in 1998 under the [[Good Friday Agreement]]. A cross-border body known as [[Foras na Gaeilge]] was established to promote the language in both Northern Ireland and the Republic.
The British government in 2001 ratified the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]]. Irish Gaelic (in respect only of Northern Ireland) was specified under Part III of the Charter, thus giving it a degree of protection and status somewhat comparable to the Welsh language in Wales and Scottish Gaelic in Scotland. This included a range of specific undertakings in relation to education, translation of statutes, interaction with public authorities, the use of placenames, media access, support for cultural activities and other matters (whilst the Ulster variant of [[Scots language|Scots]], known as [[Ulster Scots dialects|Ulster Scots]], was specified under Part II of the Charter.)

The Education (Northern Ireland) Order 1998 states: "It shall be the duty of the Department (of Education) to encourage and facilitate the development of Irish-medium education."

There are no Ulster Scots-medium schools, even at primary level.

===Americas===

====North America====

=====Canada=====
{{Main|Official bilingualism in Canada}}

======English and French======
In [[Canada]], education is under provincial jurisdiction. However, the federal government has been a strong supporter of establishing Canada as a bilingual country and has helped pioneer the [[French immersion]] programs in the public education systems throughout Canada. In French-immersion, students with no previous French language training, usually beginning in Kindergarten or grade 1, do all of their school work in French. Depending on provincial jurisdiction, some provinces also offer an extended French program that begins in grade 5 which offers relatively more courses in French. In this case the student takes French immersion until grade nine but may continue throughout their high school education. Similar English-immersion programmes also exist for Francophone children.

Education is generally monolingual in either English or French according to the majority population within which a school is located.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} The second official language is introduced with allocated time provided each week for instruction in the language as a subject.

======Quebec======
Quebec is Canada's only legally monolingual French-speaking province. Based on section 59 of Canada's Constitution Act of 1982, provides that not all of the language rights listed under Canada's official bilingualism policy in previous section 23 will apply in Quebec. Specifically:

(1) In Quebec, a child may be educated in English only if at least one parent or a sibling was educated in Canada in English.

(2)In New Brunswick, Canada's only officially bilingual province, students have the right to education in the official language which they understand; students able to understand both languages have the right to education in either system.

(3) In the rest of Canada, a child may be educated in French if at least one parent or a sibling was educated in Canada in French, or if at least one parent has French as his or her mother tongue (defined in section 23 as "first language learned and still understood").

One practical consequence of this asymmetry is that all migrants who arrive in Quebec from foreign countries are required to place their children in French-language schools. This includes immigrants whose mother tongue is English and immigrants who received their schooling in English.

On the other hand, Section 23 provides a nearly universal right to English-language schooling for the children of Canadian-born anglophones living in Quebec.
Section 23 also provides, in theory, a nearly universal right to French-language schooling for the children of all francophones living outside Quebec, including immigrants from French-speaking countries who settle outside Quebec, and who are Canadian citizens.

Another element of asymmetry between Quebec and most anglophone provinces is that while Quebec provides public English-language primary and secondary education throughout the province, most other provinces provide French-language education only "where numbers warrant."

======First Nations reserves and Inuit settlements======
Canada also has bilingual programmes for [[First Nations]]' languages on numerous [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Canadian aboriginal]] reserves in combination with either English, French, or both. Some programmes are gradually being established, whilst others are already long established. Most notable bilingual programmes that exist include [[Inuktitut]], [[Inuinnaqtun]], [[Cree]], [[Blackfoot]], [[Ojibwe]], [[Mohawk language|Mohawk]], [[Mi'kmaq language|Mi'kmaq]], and Pacific Coast [[Salish languages]].

Many of these programmes were set up in the late 1980s and early 1990s by academic [[linguists]] wishing to preserve the languages, respectively - especially in areas where there either is a healthy speaking base, or an endangerment of as low as two remaining speakers of a language. Prior to this, as late as the 1970s and early 1980s, First Nations and [[Inuit]] in Canada, as Native Americans in the United States, were forced into [[Canadian Indian residential school system|residential schools]] imposed on them by the Canadian government to integrate indigenous cultures into European-Canadian society. This came with the dramatic loss of the languages, religious beliefs, and cultures themselves due to widespread use of corporal punishment and mental abuse. As of 2010, new programmes are mushrooming across Canada to try to save what is left, but are often met with mixed success and funding challenges at federal, provincial, and reserve levels.

======Other minority languages======
In the province of [[British Columbia]], the city of [[Vancouver]] since 2002 has established a new bilingual Mandarin Chinese-English immersion programme at the elementary school level in order to accommodate Vancouver's both historic and present strong ties to the Chinese-speaking world, already in itself having a very sizeable Chinese population local to the city. Six Vancouver schools have thus far adopted the programme, and a secondary school track to continue thereupon is being designed. Other suburbs within what is referred to as the [[Greater Vancouver Regional District]] are also considering adopting the programme into a small number of schools. Similar programmes are being developed for both [[Hindi]] and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] to serve in representing the large South Asian cultural community and its interests in the [[City of Surrey]]. By default, most schools in British Columbia teach through English, with French immersion options available. In both English and French-medium schools, one can study and take government exams in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]], [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[German language|German]] at the secondary level.

In [[Alberta]], the city of [[Edmonton]] has had a well established Chinese (Mandarin) bilingual education program ([[Edmonton Chinese Bilingual Education Association]]) since 1982. The program is currently offered in 13 schools throughout the city consisting of 6 elementary schools, 4 junior high schools and 3 high schools. Students enrolled in any of the elementary schools spend half a day learning in Chinese and the other half in English.

In [[Manitoba]], [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] communities have played an extensive role in the development and history of the province. Bilingual Ukrainian-English education programmes have therefore long been established, alongside smaller programmes introducing and implementing [[French language|French]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] in the town of [[Gimli, Manitoba|Gimli]], and [[First Nations]]' languages.

Private Islamic and Jewish schools across Canada also have bilingual and trilingual programmes that include [[Arabic]] or [[Hebrew]], respectively.

In [[Cape Breton Island|Cape Breton]] and other parts of [[Nova Scotia]], a number of secondary schools now offer the option of taking introductory courses in [[Scottish Gaelic]], as reflecting upon the province's both intimate and dark history with the Gaelic language and Highland Scottish diaspora.

=====United States=====
[[File:SER-Niños Charter School.jpg|thumb|[[SER-Niños Charter School]], a bilingual [[charter school|state charter school]] in the [[Gulfton, Houston|Gulfton]] area of [[Houston]], [[Texas]]]]
Bilingual education in the U.S. focuses on English Language Learners (ELL).

The emphasis on English rejects that the student has a dominant language as part of their identity and culture that will continue to develop with time. According to the [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education]] website, a bilingual education program is "an educational program for [[limited English proficiency|limited English proficient]] students". (The Office of English Language Acquisition, 2009).{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} The term "limited English proficiency" remains in use by the federal government, but has fallen out of favor elsewhere. According to [http://www.bankstreet.edu/literacyguide/ell.html Bankstreet's Literacy Guide] this shift is due to the fact that the term ELL represents a more accurate reflection of language acquisition. The term "English language learner" is now preferred in schools and educational research to refer to a student whose first language is not English and who needs language support services in order to succeed in school.

In the United States, proponents of the practice argue that it will not only help to keep non-English-speaking children from falling behind their peers in math, science, and social studies while they master English, but such programs teach English better than English-only programs. For many students, the process of learning literacy and a new language simultaneously is simply an overwhelming task, so bilingual programs began as a way to help such students develop native language literacy first - research by Cummins,&lt;ref&gt;(1997)&lt;/ref&gt; a central researcher in the field, shows that skills such as literacy developed in a first language will transfer to English. Opponents of bilingual education argue that it delays students' mastery of English, thereby retarding the learning of other subjects as well. In [[California]], where at least one-third of students were enrolled in bilingual classes in the mid-1990s,&lt;ref name="'70s 270"&gt;{{cite book |title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 978-0-465-04195-4|pages= 270–271|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; there has been considerable politicking for and against bilingual education.

The very first instance of bilingual education in the United States occurred with Polish immigrants in the first permanent English settlement of [[Virginia]] in what is now the United States. The Poles provided the community with manufactured pitch necessary to prevent the sinking of ships, and glass works among other industries. When the [[House of Burgesses]] met in 1619, the rights extended only to Englishmen. The Poles, in turn, launched the first recorded strike in the New World.&lt;ref name="In Quest of a Cultural Identity"&gt;{{cite book |title= In Quest of a Cultural Identity: An Inquiry for the Polish Community|last= Seidner|first= Stanley S.|year= 1976|publisher= IUME, Teachers College, [[Columbia University]]|location= New York, New York|id= ERIC ED167674|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED167674&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED167674 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In dire need of their skills and industries, the Poles received the "[[rights of Englishmen]]," and established the first bilingual schools with subjects taught in English and Polish.&lt;ref name="In Quest of a Cultural Identity"/&gt;  From this first documented historic beginning, bilingual education existed in some form or another in the United States. During the 18th century, Franciscan missionaries from California to Texas used indigenous languages for translating and teaching the Catholic catechism to Native Americans. By the mid-19th century, private and public bilingual schools had include such native languages as Czech, Dutch, French, German, Norwegian, Spanish, and Swedish.&lt;ref name="The American bilingual Tradition"&gt;{{cite book |title= The American bilingual Tradition|last= Kloss|first= Heinz|origyear= 1977|year= 1998|publisher= Newbury House|location= Rowley, MA|isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ohio became the first state in 1839, to adopt a bilingual education law, authorizing German-English instruction at parents' request. Louisiana enacted an identical provision for French and English in 1847, and the New Mexico Territory did so for Spanish and English in 1850.&lt;ref name="Bilingual Education: History, Politics, Theory and Practice"&gt;{{cite book |title= Bilingual Education: History, Politics, Theory and Practice|last= Crawford|first= James|year= 1999|publisher= BES|location= Los Angeles, CA|isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 19th century, about a dozen states had passed similar laws. Elsewhere, many localities provided bilingual instruction without state sanction, in languages as diverse as Norwegian, Italian, Polish, Czech, and Cherokee.&lt;ref name="Bilingual Education: History, Politics, Theory and Practice"/&gt; Beginning in 1959, public schools in Miami introduced bilingual programs. In 1968 the U.S., with Title VII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, or, informally, the [[Bilingual Education Act]], Congress first mandated bilingual education in order to give immigrants access to education in their "first" language. The Act was amended in 1988.&lt;ref name="Bilingual Education: History, Politics, Theory and Practice"/&gt;  Federal spending on bilingual education jumped from $7.5 million in 1968 to $150 million by 1979.&lt;ref name="'70s 270"/&gt;

A 1974 [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruling, ''[[Lau v. Nichols]]'', gave further momentum to bilingual education.&lt;ref name="'70s 270"/&gt;  Here, the Court held that [[San Francisco]] schools violated minority language students' rights when they educated students in the same classes as other students&lt;ref name="'70s 270"/&gt; without special provisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rethinkingschools.org/archive/17_02/Bili172.shtml Bilingual Education Is A Human and Civil Right - Volume 17 No. 2 - Winter 2002/2003 - Rethinking Schools Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Taken together, the [[Bilingual Education Act]] and the ''Lau v. Nichols'' ruling mandated that schools needed to at least provide some type of services to support English language learners, though neither specified what type of educational program needed to be provided.  As such, both bilingual and English-only programs flourished after the law's passage and the court ruling.&lt;ref name="'70s 270"/&gt;

The [[Bilingual Education Act]] was terminated in 2001 by new federal education policy, with the passage of [[No Child Left Behind]] by the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]]. This law offers no support for native language learning, but rather emphasized accountability in English only, and mandates that all students, including ELLs, are tested yearly in English.

The majority of U.S. high school students in the United States are required to take at least one to two years of a second language.  The vast majority of these classes are either French or Spanish.  In a large number of schools this is taught in a manner known as [[Language immersion|FLES]], in which students learn about the second language in a manner similar to other subjects such as mathematics or science.  Some schools use an additional method known as [[FLEX (Language Teaching)|FLEX]] in which the "nature of the language" and culture are also taught. High school education almost never uses "immersion" techniques.

======Controversy in the United States======
In recent times there has been a lot of discussion about bilingual education. In the 2009 U.S. Supreme Court decision, [[Horne v. Flores]], the majority opinion stated, "Research on ELL instruction indicates there is documented, academic support for the view that SEI ([[Structured English Immersion]]) is significantly more effective than bilingual education."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Proponents of bilingual education claim that it is not only easier for students to learn English if they are literate in their first language, but that such students will learn English better and become bilingual and biliterate.&lt;ref&gt;(see Krashen, 2002; August &amp; Hakuta, 1997; Crawford, 2000; Cummins, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; One study shows that English language learners introduced to a transitional bilingual program gained a fair amount of English comprehension and reading skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tong |first=F. |author2=Lara-Alecio, R. |author3=Irby, B. |author4=Mathes, P. |author5=Kwok, O. |date=2008 |title=Accelerating Early Academic Oral English Development in Transitional Bilingual and Structured English Immersion Programs |journal=American Educational Research Journal |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=1011–1044 |doi=10.3102/0002831208320790 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents further claim that effective bilingual programs strive to achieve proficiency in both English and the students' home language. Dual language or Two-Way bilingual programs are one such approach, whereby half of the students speak English and half are considered English language learners (ELLs). The teacher instructs in English and in the ELLs' home language. The dual purpose of this type of classroom is to teach the children a new language and culture, and language diversity in such classrooms is seen as a resource. Programs in English only eradicate the native languages immigrants bring to this country, while dual language bilingual programs serve to maintain such languages in an "additive" context, where a new language is added without the first being lost. One paper states that two-way developmental bilingual education programs in elementary school have the most success in language minority students' long term academic achievement. These students will maintain their gains in academic performance in secondary level academic classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Collier |first=Virginia P. |date=Fall 1995 |title=Acquiring a Second Language for School |journal=Directions in Language &amp; Education - National Clearinghouse for Bilingual Education |volume=1 |issue=4 |quote=To assure cognitive and academic success in a second language, a student's first language system, oral and written, must be developed to a high cognitive level at least through the elementary-school years.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another study shows the positive results of a two-way bilingual education program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=National Center for Research on Cultural Diversity and Second Language Learning |date=March 1999 |title=Two-Way Bilingual Education Programs in Practice: A National and Local Perspective |journal=Center for Applied Linguistics |url=http://www.cal.org/resources/Digest/ed379915.html |accessdate=2008-03-14 |quote=Two-way programs provide both sets of students with ample exposure to the two languages, allowing them to progress academically in both languages and gain an appreciation of another culture. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314215044/http://www.cal.org/resources/digest/ed379915.html |archivedate=14 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study suggests that the transitional bilingual education method can improve development of the native language without hindering the development of the English language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Duran |first=L.K. |author2=Roseth, C.J. |author3=Hoffman, P. |date=2010 |title=An experimental study comparing English-only and Transitional Bilingual Education on Spanish-speaking preschoolers' early literacy development |journal=Early Chilhood Research Quarterly |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=207–217 |doi=10.1016/j.ecresq.2009.10.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some mistakenly believe that once a student can converse in English (Basic interpersonal communication skills - BICS), they will naturally perform well academically (cognitive academic language proficiency - CALP) in English. It has been postulated that BICS and CALP are two different sets of skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book   |last =Carrasquillo  | first =Angela L  |author2=Rodriguez, Vivian  | title =Language Minority Students in the Mainstream Classroom | publisher =Multilingual Matters Ltd. | year =1996  | location =Bristol, PA  | page =202 |url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED392281&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED392281  | isbn =978-1-85359-297-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of bilingual education claim that students with other primary languages besides Spanish are placed in Spanish classes rather than taught in their native languages&lt;ref name="'70s 270"/&gt; and that many bilingual education programs fail to teach students English.&lt;ref name="'70s 270"/&gt; Critics of bilingual education have claimed that studies supporting bilingual education tend to have poor methodologies and that there is little empirical support in favor of it.

The controversy over bilingual education is often enmeshed in a larger political and cultural context. Opponents of bilingual education are sometimes accused of [[racism]] and [[xenophobia]]. This is especially so in the case of such groups as [[English First (lobbying organization)|English First]], which is a conservative organization that promotes the stance that English should be the official language of the United States. In [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] and other cities, Minister of education of the [[Young Lords]], Tony Baez and others held marches and other activities to promote bilingual education. Proponents of bilingual education are frequently accused of practicing [[identity politics]], to the detriment of children and of immigrants.
:"To aid and monitor the education of English language learners (ELL)through mother-tongue and English education, the federal government enacted the Bilingual Education Act (Title V11) of the elementary and secondary Education Act in 1968. As an offshoot of president Lyndon B. Johnson's war on poverty, the act strove to help disenfranchised language-miniority students, especially Hispanics. Unfortunately, the acts aims were somewhat ambiguous. As Crawford (2000a) writes 'enacted at the apex of the Great Society, bilingual education act of 1968 passed congress without a single dissent. Americans have spent the past 30 years debating what it was meant to accomplish'." (p.&amp;nbsp;107).&lt;ref&gt;Ovando, Carlos J. (2003). "Bilingual Education in the United States: Historical Development and Current Issues" [http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/detail?accno=EJ666800 (Bilingual Research Journal, 27(1), 1-24.)]&lt;/ref&gt;

======California======
[[California]] is the state with the highest number of English Learners (ELs) in the United States. One out of three students in California is an EL.&lt;ref name="'70s 270"/&gt; In June 1998, [[Proposition 227]] was passed by 61% of the California electorate. This proposition mandates that ELs be placed in structured English immersion for a period "not normally to exceed one year," then be transferred to mainstream classrooms taught "overwhelmingly in English."&lt;ref&gt;[http://primary98.sos.ca.gov/VoterGuide/Propositions/227text.htm State of California] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618094226/http://primary98.sos.ca.gov/VoterGuide/Propositions/227text.htm |date=2010-06-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This proposition also gave parents the possibility to request alternative programs for their children, however, the availability of waivers and information to parents have been a challenge in the implementation of this proposition.&lt;ref&gt;Parrish et al., (2002). "Proposition 227 and Instruction of English Learners in California: Evaluation Update" [http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED482963&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=eric_accno&amp;accno=ED482963 (U.S. Department of Education)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the California Department of Education contracted with the American Institutes for Research (AIR) and WestEd to conduct a five-year evaluation of the effects of Proposition 227.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.air.org/news/documents/227Report.pdf |title=American Institutes for Research (AIR) |access-date=2007-07-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913185100/http://www.air.org/news/documents/227Report.pdf |archive-date=2007-09-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study methodology focused on "A combination of student achievement analysis, phone interviews, case study site visits, and written surveys was used to examine such questions as how the proposition was implemented, which EL services are most and least effective, and what [[unintended consequence]]s resulted from Proposition 227's implementation."

The authors caution about the limitations in the statewide data. California does not have the capacity to link student academic progress over time across years; however, using student-level linked data over time from the Los Angeles Unified School District, and complementing that analysis with surveys, site visits and interviews, the study found "no conclusive evidence favoring one instructional program over another." Students who remained in bilingual education have similar academic growth trajectories when compared with students who switched to English Immersion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.wested.org/cs/we/view/rs/661 |title=WestEd: Effects of the Implementation of Proposition 227 on the Education of English Learners, K-12: 2002 Report&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2007-07-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711042851/http://www.wested.org/cs/we/view/rs/661 |archive-date=2007-07-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

California, among other states, also has many public schools which have Immersion programs, most commonly Spanish/English Immersion but also including other languages. Immersion programs include native speakers of both languages and include instruction in both languages, with primary (grade) schools typically having 90% instruction in the minority language in the early grades, transitioning to 50% instruction in each of the minority language and English in the upper grades.

Proposition 227 has been repealed in 2016 by [[California Proposition 58 (2016)]].

======Arizona======
California was followed by [[Arizona]] in the passage of similar legislation, [[English for Children (Arizona Proposition 203, 2000)|Arizona Proposition 203]], which ended several programs previously available to ESL students. Arizona was the first state to provide bilingual education in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="'70s 270"/&gt;

======Georgia======
During the 1990s the state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] increased its foreign born population by 233%. That was the second largest increase in the country, and Georgia is the sixth fastest growing state in the United States. Georgia has the seventh largest illegal immigrant population in the country; in the 2000 census 228,000 illegal immigrants lived in the state. During the 1980s and 1990s a labor shortage in the carpet industry contributed to an increase in the Hispanic population of Whitfield County, Georgia. Today almost half of the students in the Dalton (the hub of Whitfield County) public schools are Hispanic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-2416 New Georgia Encyclopedia: Whitfield County]&lt;/ref&gt;

Erwin Mitchell, a local Dalton lawyer, founded the [[Georgia Project]] in 1996 to help teach the influx of Hispanic students who have moved into the Dalton public schools. The Georgia Project partners with the [[University of Monterrey]] in Monterrey, [[Mexico]] to bring teachers from Mexico to Georgia Schools. Sixty teachers from the University of Monterrey have taught in Georgia since 1997, and they typically teach for two to three years on [[H-1B visa]]s. The Georgia Project also has a Summer Institute that trains American teachers to speak Spanish and learn about Mexican culture. The Georgia Project is a bilingual/bicultural program that is primarily funded from federal education appropriations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://communityresourcebank.org/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=874 National Immigration Forum: Community Resource Bank, Success Stories, The Georgia Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

======Native American Reservations======
Following similar [[First Nations]]' models to [[Canada]], academic [[linguists]] throughout the [[United States]] are working closely with [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] reservations communities to establish immersion and second-language programs for a number of respective tribal languages including [[Navajo language|Navajo]], [[Hopi]], [[Cherokee]], [[Ojibwe]], [[Lakhota]], and [[Sioux]], among others. Due to the combination of often a violent and isolative relationship between European settlers and Native Americans, their languages and communities have suffered dramatically in terms of facing extreme endangerment or extinction. The success of these programmes is mixed, depending largely on how healthy the status of the language in question is.

However, English-medium education still remains most widely used. Native programs often suffer a lack of state support in terms of funding or encouragement due in large part to the strong preference towards a melting-pot society. [[Native American boarding schools]], which enforced white American values and the English language were extensively used as late as the 1990s, and were notorious for implementing corporal punishment if a Native child was caught speaking his or her language or freely practicing their tribal faith.

====South America====

=====Argentina=====
There are many English-Spanish schools in Argentina. Several of them are in the provinces where the Irish who were part of the local Elite used to live. While medium to big sized cities are likely to have several bilingual schools, bilingual education remains an exception rather than the norm and is generally reserved for the upper classes. There is not a nationally encompassing bilingual program available for public schools. Because of the ties that have historically bound private education to religious institutions, many of the bilingual schools in the country are Roman Catholic schools. For example, out of the three available bilingual schools in a medium-sized city such as Mar del Plata, two of them (Holy Mary of Northern Hills and Holy Trinity College) are practicing Roman Catholic schools. {{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

== Effects of mother-tongue instruction ==
Continuing to foster the abilities of children's mother tongue along with other languages has proven essential for their personal and educational development because they retain their cultural identity and gain a deeper understanding of language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cummins|first=Jim|date=2001|title=Bilingual children's mother tongue: Why is it important for education|url=|journal=Sprogforum|volume=19|pages=15–20|via=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two 2016 studies of mother-tongue instruction in Ethiopia and Kenya respectively show that it had positive outcomes for the students in both countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seid|first=Yared|date=2016-12-01|title=Does learning in mother tongue matter?

Winzer", p. 463, Gallaudet University Press, 1993, {{ISBN|1-56368-018-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The subject of '''blindness and education''' has included evolving approaches and public perceptions of how best to address the special needs of blind students. The practice of institutionalizing the [[blindness|blind]] in asylums has a history extending back over a thousand years, but it was not until the 18th century that authorities created schools for them where blind children, particularly those more privileged, were usually educated in such specialized settings. These institutions provided simple vocational and adaptive training, as well as grounding in academic subjects offered through alternative formats. Literature, for example, was being made available to blind students by way of embossed Roman letters.

==Ancient Egypt==
The Ancient Egyptians were the first civilisation to display an interest in the causes and cures for disabilities and during some periods blind people are recorded as representing a substantial portion of the poets and musicians in society.&lt;ref&gt;"''Everybody belongs''", Arthur H. Shapiro, p. 152, Routledge, 2000, {{ISBN|0-8153-3960-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] (c. 2040-1640 BCE), [[Harper's Songs|blind harpists]] are depicted on tomb walls.&lt;ref name="Middle Egyptian p343"/&gt; They were not exclusively interested in the causes and cures for blindness but also the social care of the individual.&lt;ref name=Winzer/&gt;

==Early institutions for the blind==
Asylums for the Industrious Blind were established in [[Edinburgh]] and [[Bristol]] in 1765, but the first school anywhere, to expressly teach the blind was set up by Henry Dannett in [[Liverpool]] as the School for the Instruction of the Indigent Blind. It taught the blind children skills in manual crafts although there was no formal education as such. Other institutions set up at that time were: the School for the Indigent Blind in [[London]] and the Asylum and School for the Indigent Blind at [[Norwich]].

In [[France]], the [[Institut National des Jeunes Aveugles]] was established in 1784 by [[Valentin Haüy]]. Haüy's impulse to help the blind began when he witnessed the blind being mocked during a religious street festival.{{sfn|Herbermann|1913}} In May 1784, at [[Saint-Germain-des-Prés]], he met a young beggar, [[François Lesueur]]; he was his first student. He developed a method of raised letters, to teach Lesueur to read, and compose sentences. He made rapid progress, and Haüy announced the success, in September 1784 in the ''[[Journal de Paris]]'', then receiving encouragement from the [[French Academy of Sciences]].

With the help of the Philanthropic Society Haüy founded the Institute for Blind Youth, the [[Institut National des Jeunes Aveugles]], in February 1785. Building on the philanthropic spinning workshop for the blind, the institution of Blind Children was dedicated on 26 December 1786. Its purpose was to educate students and teach them manual work: spinning, and letterpress.

Attempts to actually educate the blind were first attempted towards the end of the century. Until that time they were considered mostly ineducable and un-trainable. One of the major figures in the movement to educate the blind was [[Sébastien Guillié]]. He established the first [[ophthalmology|ophthalmological]] clinic in France and became director of the school in Paris.

==Braille system==
[[Louis Braille]] attended Haüy's school in 1819 and later taught there. He soon became determined to fashion a system of reading and writing that could bridge the critical gap in communication between the sighted and the blind. In his own words: "Access to communication in the widest sense is access to knowledge, and that is vitally important for us if we [the blind] are not to go on being despised or patronized by condescending sighted people. We do not need pity, nor do we need to be reminded we are vulnerable. We must be treated as equals – and communication is the way this can be brought about."&lt;ref name=Olmstrom&gt;Olmstrom, pp. 161–162.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Braille alfabet.jpg|thumb|right|Alphabet chart for English [[braille]]. The letter "W" is not part of the French alphabet, and was only appended to the additional letters with diacritics.]]
In 1821, Braille learned of a communication system devised by Captain [[Charles Barbier]] of the French Army.&lt;ref&gt;Kugelmass (1951), pp. 108–115.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marsan"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.avh.asso.fr/rubriques/infos_braille/actes/Louis%20Braille%20-%20a%20brief%20overview.htm |title=Louis Braille: A Brief Overview |author=Marsan, Colette |year=2009 |publisher=Association Valentin Haüy |accessdate=7 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RNIB&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.rnib.org.uk/aboutus/aboutsightloss/famous/Pages/louisbraille.aspx |title=Who was Louis Braille? |year=2010 |publisher=Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) |accessdate=7 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Barbier's "[[night writing]]", was a code of dots and dashes impressed into thick paper. These impressions could be interpreted entirely by the fingers, letting soldiers share information on the battlefield without having light or needing to speak.&lt;ref name=Farrell96&gt;Farrell, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

The captain's code turned out to be too complex to use in its original military form, but it inspired Braille to develop a system of his own.&lt;ref&gt;Kugelmass (1951), pp. 117–118.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farrell, pp. 96–97.&lt;/ref&gt; Braille worked tirelessly on his ideas, and his system was largely completed by 1824, when he was just fifteen years of age.&lt;ref name=Olmstrom/&gt;&lt;ref name=Farrell98&gt;Farrell, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; From Barbier's night writing, he innovated by simplifying its form and maximizing its efficiency. He made uniform columns for each letter, and he reduced the twelve raised dots to six. He published his system [[1829 braille|in 1829]], and by the second edition in 1837 had discarded the dashes because they were too difficult to read. Crucially, Braille's smaller cells were capable of being recognized as letters with a single touch of a finger.&lt;ref name=Farrell98/&gt;

==Education for the blind==
The first school with a focus on proper education was the Yorkshire School for the Blind in England. Established in 1835, it taught arithmetic, reading and writing, while at the school of the [[London Society for Teaching the Blind to Read]] founded in 1838 a general education was seen as the ideal that would contribute the most to the prosperity of the blind. Educator Thomas Lucas introduced the Lucas Type, an early form of embossed text different from the Braille system.

Another important institution at the time was the General Institution for the Blind at [[Birmingham]] (1847), which included training for industrial jobs alongside a more general [[curriculum]]. The first school for blind adults was founded in 1866 at [[Worcester]] and was called the College for the Blind Sons of Gentlemen.

In 1889 the Edgerton Commission published a report that recommended that the blind should receive compulsory education from the age of 5–16 years. The law was finally passed in 1893, as an element of the broader Elementary Education Act. This act ensured that blind people up to the age of 16 years were entitled to an Elementary-Level Education as well as to Vocational Training.

The 1880s also saw the introduction of compulsory elementary education for the Blind throughout the United States. (However, most states of the United States did not pass laws specifically making elementary education compulsory ''for the blind'' until after 1900.&lt;ref&gt;''The Blind: Their Condition and the Work Being Done for Them in the United States'', Harry Best, p372, The Macmillan Company, 1919&lt;/ref&gt;){{clarify|date=October 2012}}

[[File:Blind children examining taxidermied reptiles and preserved shells (Sunderland Museum, June 1913).jpg|thumb|alt=1910s photo of school children being taught to use touch to identify various creatures at Sunderland Museum.|Children from the Sunderland Council Blind School using touch to identify different creatures at [[Sunderland Museum]], 1910s.]]
By this time, reading codes - chiefly [[Braille]] and [[New York Point]] - had gained favor among educators as embossed letters (such as [[Moon type]] were said by some to be difficult to learn and cumbersome to use, and so (DOT CODES) were either newly created or imported from well-established schools in Europe. Though New York Point was widely accepted for a time, Braille has since emerged the victor in what some blindness historians have dubbed “the War of the Dots.”

The more respected residential schools were staffed by competent teachers who kept abreast of the latest developments in educational theory. While some of their methods seem archaic by today’s standards - particularly where their Vocational Training options are concerned - their efforts did pave the way for the education and integration of blind students in the 20th century. &lt;!--What is blind?--&gt;

The early 20th century saw a handful of blind students enrolled in their neighborhood schools, with special educational supports. Most still attended residential institutions, but that number dropped steadily as the years wore on - especially after the white cane was adopted into common use as a mobility tool and symbol of blindness in the 1930s.

==Aniruddha’s Bank for The Blind==

An estimated 253 million people live with vision impairment: 36 million are blind and 217 million have moderate to severe vision impairment in the world with nearly 80 lakhs in India itself out of which number of blind students is close to 30 lakhs. Blind students continue to study with huge efforts and surmounting all obstacles with positive attitude. As per the law of nature, when one sensory organ does not function in human body, the other sensory organs become more active to compensate the defect. In case of blind person, hearing and touch are very active and play an important role.
[[Aniruddha%27s Bank for the Blind#|Aniruddha’s Bank for The Blind]] conceptualized and operationalized by Shree Aniruddha Upasana Foundation, Mumbai, India supports the education for blind in an affectionate and unique way. The bank, records the study curriculum in 12 languages like English, Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, Tamil, Kannada, Bengali, Malayalam, Telugu, Sanskrit and so on by the people who are well versed in their own mother tongue. Till date, the recorded CDs have made a difference in the lives of blind people in almost 26 states of India and a few regions of neighbouring country Pakistan too. The bank maintains high quality and standard of the CDs by regular and diligent verification.

==Today==
[[File:Honolulu-Library-for-Blind&amp;Handicapped.JPG|left|thumb|Waikiki-Kapahulu Library for the Blind and Physically Handicapped in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]]]]
Most blind and visually impaired students now attend their neighborhood schools{{where|date=February 2016}}, often aided in their educational pursuits by regular teachers of academics and by a team of professionals who train them in alternative skills: Orientation and Mobility (O and M) training - instruction in independent travel - is usually taught by contractors educated in that area, as is Braille.

Blind children may also need special training in understanding spatial concepts, and in self-care, as they are often unable to learn visually and through imitation as other children do. Moreover, [[home economics]] and education dealing with [[anatomy]] are necessary for children with severe visual impairments.

Since only ten percent of those registered as legally blind have no usable [[Visual perception|vision]], many students are also taught to use their remaining sight to maximum effect, so that some read print (with or without optical aids) and travel without canes.

A combination of necessary training tailored to the unique needs of each student, and solid academics, is going a long way towards producing blind and visually impaired students capable of dealing with the world independently.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17350">'''CNCD Decision 323/2006''' is a decision of [[Romania|Romania's]] [[National Council for Combating Discrimination]] (CNCD) regarding the display of religious symbols in public schools. The decision was brought to the CNCD by Emil Moise, a teacher and parent from [[Buzău County]], who stated that the public display of [[Romanian Orthodox icons|Orthodox icons]] in classrooms constitutes an infringement of Romania's [[separation of church and state]] and discriminates against atheist, agnostic and non-religious people.

On November 21, 2006, the CNCD upheld Moise's complaint, ruling that the [[Ministry of Education, Research and Youth (Romania)|Ministry of Education]], who operates public schools, must "respect the secular character of the state and the autonomy of religion" and that "religious symbols must only be shown during religion lessons or in areas dedicated exclusively to religious education." On June 11, 2008, the [[High Court of Cassation and Justice (Romania)|High Court of Cassation and Justice]] ruled that the presence of icons in schools is legal, in effect overturning the CNCD's decision.

==History==

In 2005, Emil Moise (who affirms himself to be Christian-Orthodox)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ziua.ro/display.php?data=2006-11-18&amp;id=211404 Emil Moise a dat în judecată Inspectoratul Judeţean] (''Emil Moise has sued the County Inspectorate''), ''[[Ziua]]'', 18 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; took the Buzău County School Inspectorate to court due to the presence of Romanian Orthodox icons in his daughter's school, the Margareta Sterian Art High School in [[Buzău]]. He claimed that the presence of such religious symbols in a state institution is an infringement of Romania's constitutionally-guaranteed freedom of conscience and freedom of religion. The Buzău County Court ruled on March 27, 2005, in Decision 157/2005, that:

{{quote|The existence of religious symbols on the walls of school chancelleries, halls and classrooms does not infringe the fundamental rights of freedom of conscience, thought and the freedom of religious belief, and that of equality in student's rights, and does not represent a discriminatory situation for the plaintiff's daughter, a student at the Margareta Sterian Art High School in Buzău, who attends religion classes. It must be noted that in the case of this educational institution there exists a special situation in comparison to other schools run by the Buzău County School Inspectorate, in that the majority of icons exhibited in this institutions are elaborate works of the high school's students and are considered objects of art."}}

In this way, the County Court rejected Moise's complaint, upholding the maintenance of the religious symbols in the Margareta Sterian Art High School. Moise appealed to the Ploieşti Court of Appeals, which upheld the County Court's decision on July 20, 2006.

In July 2006, Moise filed a complaint at the National Council for Combating Discrimination, or CNCD, Romania's anti-discrimination and equality watchdog, claiming discrimination on the basis of religion under Romania's anti-discrimination law of 2000, and asking for the removal of religious symbols from all Romanian public education institutions.

On November 13, 2006, a number of Romanian non-governmental organisations sent a letter to the CNCD backing Moise's complaint. These included the Pro Democratia Association, the [[Noesis Cultural Society]], the Education 2000+ Centre, the Centre for International Studies, [[Accept (organization)|Accept]], the Agency for Press Monitoring, the Pro Europa League, the Centre for Juridical Resources, the Centre for Independent Journalism and the Solidarity for Freedom of Conscience. The political analyst [[Cristian Pârvulescu]], the human rights activist [[Renate Weber]] and the Romanian branch of [[Indymedia]] also supported the complaint.
&lt;ref&gt;Adriana Petrescu et al., [http://romania.indymedia.org/ro/2006/11/1713.shtml Scrisoare catre CNCD re: simboluri religioase] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070102035609/http://www.romania.indymedia.org/ro/2006/11/1713.shtml |date=2007-01-02 }} ("Letter to the CNCD re: religious symbols"), Indymedia Româna, 13 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 14, 2006, Emil Moise was interviewed at the CNCD's headquarters in Bucharest. On the same date, the Secretary of State for Religious Affairs, Adrian Lemeni, also made a submission to the CNCD, asking that the religious symbols be maintained in schools. He argued that Orthodox icons were not an object of "religious veneration", but rather a symbol of freedom, "as well as having a powerful national symbols, being considered expressions of Romania's spiritual and cultural heritage." He concluded by saying that:

{{quote|We consider, in principle, that the display of religious symbols on the public walls of educational institutions does not constitute a breach of other people's rights and liberties so as to necessitate their removal, a solution which has not been adopted in any other European state with traditions similar to those of Romania.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salvati-icoanele.info/2006/11/21/scrisoarea-secretarului-de-stat-pentru-culte-adrian-lemeni-catre-cncd/ Poziţia Secretarului de Stat pentru Culte Adrian Lemeni la audierea din comisia CNCD] (''The position of the Secretary of State for Religious Affairs, Adrian Lemeni'')&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Decision==

The CNCD's decision on Moise's complaint was made on November 21, 2006. On this date, the organisation disclosed a press release outlining that its decision and stating that a more complete explanation will be available in 15 days, according to law. The decision stipulated that:

{{quote|the Ministry of Education must elaborate and implement an internal regulation, in a reasonable amount of time, that regulates the presence of religious symbols in institutions of public education. This internal norm must be based on the following principles:

# It must assure the right to education and access to culture on the basis of equality;
# It must respect the right of parents to assure their children's education based on their religious and philosophical beliefs;
# It must respect the secular character of the state and the autonomy of religions;
# It must assure the freedom of religion, conscience and beliefs of all children on the basis of equality;
# '''Religious symbols may only be displayed during religious education classes and in areas intended exclusively for religious education'''.}}

The CNCD's president, [[Csaba Ferenc Asztalos]], stated that "[Through this decision], we recognised the relationship between the state and religions in Romania; we haven't touched on the historical recognition of the contributions of Christianity to the formation of the Romanian people. Now we call on the state, through the Ministry of Education, to assume its responsibilities on what happens in schools in this respect."&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/romanian/news/story/2006/11/061122_simboluri_religioase_romania.shtml Şcoala - cu sau fără simboluri religioase?] (''School - with or without religious symbols?''), [[BBC]] Romanian Service, November 22, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response==

The CNCD decision provoked widespread public debate on the issue of religious symbols of public schools, and also on the overall role of religion in Romanian society.

===Emil Moise===

Emil Moise lauded the CNCD's decision to uphold his complaint, claiming it was "an extraordinary result" in the separation between church and state, and that "this is what the legislation for combating discrimination states". He also declared that, "the Ministry of Education has a single thing to do now: to respect the CNCD's recommendation. Otherwise, I will return to court..."&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;

===Government===

After the CNCD's ruling, the [[Ministry of Education and Research of Romania|Ministry of Education and Research]] responded that "due to the special character of the decisions which must be taken", it would send the ruling to the Education Commission of the [[Parliament of Romania|Romanian Parliament]] for debate. After the CNCD decision was fully published, the Ministry issued a comment stating it will not implement the CNCD's decision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edu.ro/index.php/pressrel/7103/(''Prezenţa simbolurilor religioase în şcoli trebuie să fie decisă de comunitate, de părinţii elevilor şi, nu în ultimul rând, de şcoală'')]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, 12 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious groups===

The Patriarchate of the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]] issued a press release on November 23, 2006 criticising the CNCD decision as an attack on "freedom of religion". The release stated that "the presence of religious symbols in schools is not the result of an imposition, but rather of the desire and consent of parents, teachers and students in conformity with the religious and cultural values which they share. Consequently, a decision to exclude [these symbols] would represent a brutal and unjustified measure of restraining religious liberty, contrary to European democratic principles. Such a decision would lead to the discrimination of Romanian [religious] believers."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patriarhia.ro/Stiri/2006/115.html Comunicat de presă - 23 noiembrie 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070109021730/http://www.patriarhia.ro/Stiri/2006/115.html |date=2007-01-09 }} (''Press release - 23 November 2006''), Patriarchy of the Romanian Orthodox Church&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the spokesperson of the Orthodox Church, Constantin Stoica, declared that the issue of religious symbols in schools should be resolved by local communities and not be regulated by "neither the Church, nor the Ministry of Education, nor the CNCD". He also declared that "just as the majority must respect the rights of minorities, minorities must also respect the rights of the majority",&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; echoing the Church's line that the CNCD decision went against Romania's Orthodox majority, which forms approximately 87% of the population according to the 2002 census.

Other religious groups also criticised the CNCD's decision. The [[Roman Catholicism in Romania|Roman Catholic]] Archbishopric of Bucharest characterised the decision as "abusive and discriminatory" and going against the "sensibilities and religious freedoms of the Romanian people". The [[Armenian Orthodox Church]] in Romania compared the decision to a nihilistic stance, and stated that while "Emil Moise wishes to be a defender of the rights of atheist children... the atheist is indifferent, neutral, on the subject of symbols of the divinity; he denies rather than combats God."&lt;ref name="religious-response"&gt;[http://www.ziua.ro/display.php?data=2006-11-29&amp;id=211988 Doar CNCD şi Moise din Buzău sunt ofensaţi de icoane] (''Just the CNCD and Emil Moise from Buzău are offended by icons''), ''[[Ziua]]'', 29 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Murat Yusuf]], the mufti of [[Islam in Romania|Romania's small Islamic community]] opposed the decision, saying that Romania was an example of religious tolerance and co-existence, and that such a law was hence unnecessary. He stated that the Muslim community has lived for "more than eight centuries in these lands" and "the existence of other religious symbols in public institutions never bothered us and does not bother us now."&lt;ref name="religious-response" /&gt;

Speaking on behalf of the [[History of the Jews in Romania|even smaller Jewish community]], Aurel Vainer, who represents the Federation of Jewish Communities of Romania in [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Parliament]], noted that "the Romanian people is in large part a Christian people" and characterised the debate as one that "serves no purpose in our country." He described the presence of icons as "a right won by Romania's Christians" and saw no hindrance to their continued display in schools.&lt;ref name="religious-response" /&gt;

===Civic Media petition===

On November 22, 2006, an online petition was started by Civic Media, a journalism [[NGO]], with the aim of overturning the CNCD decision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salvati-icoanele.info/2006/11/20/catre-guvernul-romaniei/ Petiţie-scrisoare deschisă pentru păstrarea simbolurilor religioase în şcoli]&lt;/ref&gt; The petition stated that the decision was "anti-European", "anti-religious" and "discriminatory" to Romania's Orthodox majority. It also cited court rulings in Italy and Greece which upheld the right of public schools to display Christian symbols such as crosses. The petition was signed by more than 3,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://civicmedia.ro/acm/index.php?option=com_wrapper&amp;Itemid=41 Semnaţi pentru icoanele din şcoli!] (''Sign for the icons in schools''), Civic Media petition&lt;/ref&gt; Civic Media, founded in 2000, has been involved in conservative religious campaigning before, starting a similar petition in 2006 to prevent the construction of a modern shopping centre near St Joseph's Cathedral ([[Roman Catholic]]) in Bucharest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://civicmedia.ro/acm/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=25&amp;Itemid=37 Despre Civic Media] (''About Civic Media'')&lt;/ref&gt;

The petition was also supported by roughly 150 organisations like Altermedia, and the Romanian Association for Heritage or the ROST Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Ionel Dâncu, [http://www.9am.ro/stiri-revista-presei/A/54327/Urmasii-lui-Zelea-Codreanu-iau-cu-asalt-Romania Urmasii lui Zelea Codreanu iau cu asalt Romania], ''Curentul'', 6 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Ionut Dulamita, [http://www.cotidianul.ro/index.php?id=9888&amp;art=26229&amp;cHash=81635d41ae Ura da in clocot pe Internet], ''[[Cotidianul]], 27 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Lucian Mîndruţă, [http://www.dilemaveche.ro/index.php?nr=124&amp;cmd=articol&amp;id=1544 Ţara necunoscută.

Giurescu]], [[Constantin Bălăceanu-Stolnici]]), the president of the [[National Initiative Party]], [[Cozmin Guşă]], and the youth wing of the [[Christian-Democratic National Peasants' Party (Romania)|Christian-Democratic People's Party]]. Two major teachers unions (the National Education Federation and Spiru Haret Union, with almost 120,000 members) and three major media organisations endorsed the petition (MediaSind Media Union, the Romanian Journalists' Society and The Romanian Union of Professional Journalists).

Civic Media also stated that they will appeal the CNCD's decision in court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civicmedia.ro/?p=28 Civic Media contestă categoric decizia CNCD anti-religie, inclusiv în instanţă] (''Civic Media categorically contests the CNCD's anti-religious decision, including in court''), Civic Media, 22 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overturning of CNCD Decision===

On June 11, 2008, the [[High Court of Cassation and Justice (Romania)|High Court of Cassation and Justice]] ruled that the presence of icons in schools is legal, in effect overturning the CNCD's decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.mediafax.ro/social/icoanele-raman-in-scoli-prezenta-lor-este-legala-2705772 "Icoanele rămân în şcoli, prezenţa lor este legală"], Mediafax, 12 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The ruling has been confirmed later in a separate cause brought before the Court by another NGO, "Pro-vita".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.salvati-icoanele.info/2009/05/27/decizia-anti-simboluri-religioase-a-cncd-anulata-a-doua-oara/ "Decizia anti-simboluri religioase a CNCD, anulată a doua oară"], 27 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9444">The '''Changjiang (Yangtze River) Scholar''' award ({{zh|c=长江学者奖励计划|p=chángjiāng xuézhě jiānglì jìhuà}}), is the highest academic award issued to an individual in [[higher education]] by the [[Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Education]] of the [[People's Republic of China]].&lt;ref name="Nature"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harvard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WUSL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NWU" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MOE" /&gt;&lt;ref name="people's daily"/&gt;  The award is also known as the "Cheung Kong Scholar" award&lt;ref name="lksf" /&gt; and is referred to in English both internationally and by official Chinese government publications as the "Yangtze River" Scholar award.&lt;ref name="NWU"/&gt;&lt;ref name="european union"/&gt;&lt;ref name="china daily"/&gt;&lt;ref name="global times"/&gt;

==History==
The initial funding for this program was provided by the Hong Kong-based [[Li Ka Shing Foundation]] (李嘉诚基金会), with the goal of elevating research at Chinese universities to the highest levels internationally.&lt;ref name="scholars abroad" /&gt;&lt;ref name="1000 plan" /&gt;  The program began in August 1998. 

The program has enabled Chinese universities to provide international recognition to leading academics, but has led to difficulties for less prestigious universities in China. Individuals who receive the Changjiang (Yangtze River) Scholar award have become targets for recruitment by competing Chinese universities so frequently that the Ministry of Education issued a notice in 2013 barring universities from hiring away Changjiang professors, and another 2017 discouraging Chinese universities from recruiting away top faculty from one another.&lt;ref name="Nature"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ChinaMOE"/&gt;

==Selection==
The Changjiang Scholars Program mainly recognizes China’s domestic top scholars, who receive the prestigious title of Changjiang Distinguished Professor at their own Chinese universities and are provided with some research resources to enhance the recipients' research programs.&lt;ref name="MOE" /&gt;  This is in contrast to the [[Thousand Talents Program (China)|Thousand Talents Plan]], which recruits top experts from overseas and is administered separately and directly by the central government.&lt;ref name="Nature"/&gt;

Although the award is rarely granted to foreign scientists, a few renowned international scholars are chosen each year.&lt;ref name="Harvard" /&gt;  These internationally renowned scholars include Nobel Prize Laureates&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.nsd.pku.edu.cn/article.asp?articleid=6975|title=Gary S.

Although these professorships can be affiliated with any university in China, they are awarded disproportionately to individuals affiliated with the most prestigious ([[C9 League]]) universities.&lt;ref name="Elsevier"/&gt;

'''Creativity''' is a phenomenon whereby something new and somehow valuable is formed. The created item may be intangible (such as an [[idea]], a [[scientific theory]], a [[musical composition]], or a [[joke]]) or a physical object (such as an [[invention]], a [[Literature|literary work]], or a [[painting]]).

Scholarly interest in creativity is found in a number of disciplines, primarily [[psychology]], [[business studies]], and [[cognitive science]], but also [[education]], [[technology]], [[engineering]], [[philosophy]] (particularly [[philosophy of science]]), [[theology]], [[sociology]], [[linguistics]],  and [[economics]], covering  the relations between creativity and general [[intelligence]], personality type, mental and neurological processes, mental health, or [[artificial intelligence]]; the potential for fostering creativity through education and training; the fostering of creativity for national economic benefit, and the application of creative resources to improve the effectiveness of teaching and learning.

== Etymology ==
The [[lexeme]] in the English word ''creativity'' comes from the [[Latin]] term ''creō'' "to create, make": its [[Morphological derivation|derivational suffixes]] also come from Latin. The word "create" appeared in English as early as the 14th century, notably in Chaucer, to indicate divine creation&lt;ref name="RuncoAlbert"&gt;{{cite book|last=Runco|first=Mark A.|title=The Cambridge Handbook of Creativity|year=2010|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-73025-9|author2=Albert, Robert S.|editor=[[James C. Kaufman]] |editor2=Robert J. Sternberg|chapter=Creativity Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in [[The Parson's Tale]]&lt;ref&gt;"And eke Job saith, that in hell is no order of rule. And albeit that God hath '''created''' all things in right order, and nothing without order, but all things be ordered and numbered, yet nevertheless they that be damned be not in order, nor hold no order."&lt;/ref&gt;). However, its modern meaning as an act of human creation did not emerge until after [[Age of Enlightenment|the Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name=RuncoAlbert /&gt;

== Definition ==
In a summary of scientific research into creativity, Michael Mumford suggested: "Over the course of the last decade, however, we seem to have reached a general agreement that creativity involves the production of novel, useful products" (Mumford, 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;110),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mumford | first1 = M. D. | year = 2003 | title = Where have we been, where are we going? Taking stock in creativity research | url = | journal = [[Creativity Research Journal]] | volume = 15 | issue = 2–3| pages = 107–120 | doi=10.1080/10400419.2003.9651403}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, in [[Robert Sternberg]]'s words, the production of "something original and worthwhile".&lt;ref name="Sternberg Cognitive Psychology 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sternberg|first1=Robert J.|title=Cognitive Psychology|date=2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-133-38701-5|page=479|edition=6|chapter=Creativity}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authors have diverged dramatically in their precise definitions beyond these general commonalities: Peter Meusburger reckons that over a hundred different analyses can be found in the literature.&lt;ref name="Meusburger1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Meusburger|first=Peter|title=Milieus of Creativity: An Interdisciplinary Approach to Spatiality of Creativity|year=2009|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-9876-5 |editor=Meusburger, P. |editor2=Funke, J. |editor3=Wunder, E.|chapter=Milieus of Creativity: The Role of Places, Environments and Spatial Contexts}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an illustration, one definition given by [[Ellis Paul Torrance|Dr. E. Paul Torrance]] described it as "a process of becoming sensitive to problems, deficiencies, gaps in knowledge, missing elements, disharmonies, and so on; identifying the difficulty; searching for solutions, making guesses, or formulating hypotheses about the deficiencies: testing and retesting these hypotheses and possibly modifying and retesting them; and finally communicating the results."&lt;ref name="Torrance Test Manual Verbal"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Torrance|first1=Paul|title=The Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking-Norms-Technical Manual Research Edition|publisher=Personnel Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|page=6|chapter=Verbal Tests. Forms A and B-Figural Tests, Forms A and B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aspects ==
Theories of creativity (particularly investigation of why some people are more creative than others) have focused on a variety of aspects. The dominant factors are usually identified as "the four Ps" — process, product, person, and place (according to [[James Melvin Rhodes|Mel Rhodes]]).&lt;ref&gt;Mel Rhodes: [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/20342603?uid=3737864&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21103750220081''An Analysis of Creativity.''] in Phi Delta Kappan 1961, Vol. 42,  No. 7, p. 306–307&lt;/ref&gt; A focus on ''process'' is shown in cognitive approaches that try to describe thought mechanisms and techniques for creative thinking. Theories invoking divergent rather than convergent thinking (such as [[J. P. Guilford|Guilford]]), or those describing the staging of the creative process (such as [[Graham Wallas|Wallas]]) are primarily theories of creative process. A focus on creative ''product'' usually appears in attempts to measure creativity (psychometrics, see below) and in creative ideas framed as successful [[memetics|memes]].&lt;ref name="Gabora"&gt;{{cite journal|last=[[Liane Gabora|Gabora, Liane]]|year=1997|title= The Origin and Evolution of Culture and Creativity|journal=Journal of Memetics – Evolutionary Models of Information Transmission|volume=1|url=http://cogprints.org/794/1/oecc.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychometric approach to creativity reveals that it also involves the ability to produce more.&lt;ref name="Sternberg 2009 468"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sternberg|first=Robert J.|title=Cognitive Psychology|year=2009|publisher=CENGAGE Learning|isbn=978-0-495-50629-4|page=468|editor=Jaime A. Perkins |editor2=Dan Moneypenny |editor3=Wilson Co}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A focus on the nature of the creative ''person'' considers more general intellectual habits, such as openness, levels of [[Ideation (creative process)|ideation]], autonomy, expertise, exploratory behavior, and so on. A focus on ''place'' considers the circumstances in which creativity flourishes, such as degrees of autonomy, access to resources, and the nature of gatekeepers. Creative lifestyles are characterized by nonconforming attitudes and behaviors as well as flexibility.&lt;ref name="Sternberg 2009 468" /&gt;

== History of the concept ==
{{Main|History of the concept of creativity}}
[[File:Plato-raphael.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Greek philosophers like Plato rejected the concept of creativity, preferring to see art as a form of discovery. Asked in ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', "Will we say, of a painter, that he makes something?", Plato answers, "Certainly not, he merely [[mimesis|imitates]]."&lt;ref name="Six Ideas p. 244"&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], ''A History of Six Ideas: an Essay in Aesthetics'', p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

=== Ancient views ===
Most ancient cultures, including thinkers of [[Ancient Greece]],&lt;ref name="Six Ideas p. 244" /&gt; [[History of China#Ancient China|Ancient China]], and [[Outline of ancient India|Ancient India]],&lt;ref name="Albert99"&gt;{{cite book|last=Albert|first= R. S.|author2=Runco, M. A.|year=1999|editor = Sternberg, R. J.|title= Handbook of Creativity|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]|chapter=:A History of Research on Creativity}}&lt;/ref&gt; lacked the concept of creativity, seeing art as a form of discovery and not creation. The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] had no terms corresponding to "to create" or "creator" except for the expression "''poiein''" ("to make"), which only applied to ''poiesis'' (poetry) and to the ''poietes'' (poet, or "maker") who made it. [[Plato]] did not believe in art as a form of creation. Asked in ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Plato, The Republic, Book X – [[wikisource:The Republic/Book X]]&lt;/ref&gt; "Will we say, of a painter, that he makes something?", he answers, "Certainly not, he merely [[mimesis|imitates]]."&lt;ref name="Six Ideas p. 244" /&gt;

It is commonly argued that the notion of "creativity" originated in [[Western culture]] through [[Christianity]], as a matter of [[Revelation|divine inspiration]].&lt;ref name="RuncoAlbert" /&gt; According to the historian [[Daniel J.

=== The Enlightenment and after ===
The rejection of creativity in favor of discovery and the belief that individual creation was a conduit of the divine would dominate the West probably until the [[Renaissance]] and even later.&lt;ref name="NiuSternberg" /&gt; The development of the modern concept of creativity begins in the [[Renaissance]], when creation began to be perceived as having originated from the abilities of the individual, and not God. This could be attributed to the leading intellectual movement of the time, aptly named [[humanism]], which developed an intensely human-centric outlook on the world, valuing the intellect and achievement of the individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Humanism - Rome Reborn: The Vatican Library &amp; Renaissance Culture {{!}} Exhibitions - Library of Congress|url = https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/vatican/humanism.html|website = www.loc.gov|date = 1993-01-08|accessdate = 2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this philosophy arose the [[Renaissance man]] (or polymath), an individual who embodies the principals of humanism in their ceaseless courtship with knowledge and creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Leonardo da Vinci {{!}} Italian artist, engineer, and scientist|url = http://www.britannica.com/biography/Leonardo-da-Vinci|website = Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate = 2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most well-known and immensely accomplished examples is [[Leonardo da Vinci]].

However, this shift was gradual and would not become immediately apparent until the Enlightenment.&lt;ref name="Albert3" /&gt; By the 18th century and the [[Age of Enlightenment]], mention of creativity (notably in [[aesthetics]]), linked with the concept of [[imagination]], became more frequent.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz80"&gt;{{cite book |author=Tatarkiewicz, Władysław |authorlink=Władysław Tatarkiewicz |title=A History of Six Ideas: an Essay in Aesthetics |location=Translated from the Polish by [[Christopher Kasparek]], The Hague |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff |year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the writing of [[Thomas Hobbes]], imagination became a key element of human cognition;&lt;ref name="RuncoAlbert" /&gt; [[William Duff (writer)|William Duff]] was one of the first to identify imagination as a quality of [[genius]], typifying the separation being made between talent (productive, but breaking no new ground) and genius.&lt;ref name="Dacey" /&gt;

As a direct and independent topic of study, creativity effectively received no attention until the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Dacey" /&gt; Runco and Albert argue that creativity as the subject of proper study began seriously to emerge in the late 19th century with the increased interest in individual differences inspired by the arrival of [[Darwinism]]. In particular, they refer to the work of [[Francis Galton]], who through his [[Eugenics|eugenicist]] outlook took a keen interest in the heritability of intelligence, with creativity taken as an aspect of genius.&lt;ref name="RuncoAlbert" /&gt;

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, leading mathematicians and scientists such as [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] (1896) and [[Henri Poincaré]] (1908) began to reflect on and publicly discuss their creative processes.

=== Twentieth century to the present day ===
The insights of Poincaré and von Helmholtz were built on in early accounts of the creative process by pioneering theorists such as [[Graham Wallas]]&lt;ref name="Wallas26"&gt;{{cite book |author=Wallas, G. |title=Art of Thought |year=1926 |authorlink=Graham Wallas}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Max Wertheimer]]. In his work ''Art of Thought'', published in 1926, Wallas presented one of the first models of the creative process. In the Wallas stage model, creative insights and illuminations may be explained by a process consisting of 5 stages:
:(i) ''preparation'' (preparatory work on a problem that focuses the individual's mind on the problem and explores the problem's dimensions),
:(ii) ''incubation'' (where the problem is internalized into the unconscious mind and nothing appears externally to be happening),
:(iii) ''intimation'' (the creative person gets a "feeling" that a solution is on its way),
:(iv) ''illumination'' or insight (where the creative idea bursts forth from its [[preconscious]] processing into conscious awareness);
:(v) ''verification'' (where the idea is consciously verified, elaborated, and then applied).
Wallas' model is often treated as four stages, with "intimation" seen as a sub-stage.

Wallas considered creativity to be a legacy of the [[evolution]]ary process, which allowed humans to quickly adapt to rapidly changing environments. Simonton&lt;ref name="Simonton99"&gt;{{cite book |author=Simonton, D. K. |year=1999 |title=Origins of genius: Darwinian perspectives on creativity |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides an updated perspective on this view in his book, ''Origins of genius: Darwinian perspectives on creativity''.

In 1927, [[Alfred North Whitehead]] gave the Gifford Lectures at the University of Edinburgh, later published as ''[[Process and Reality]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Whitehead|first=Alfred North|title=Process and reality : an essay in cosmology ; Gifford Lectures delivered in the University of Edinburgh during the session 1927–28|year=1978|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-02-934580-1|edition=Corrected}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is credited with having coined the term "creativity" to serve as the ultimate category of his metaphysical scheme: "Whitehead actually coined the term – our term, still the preferred currency of exchange among literature, science, and the arts. . . a term that quickly became so popular, so omnipresent, that its invention within living memory, and by Alfred North Whitehead of all people, quickly became occluded".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Steven|title=Introduction: Whitehead Now|journal=Configurations|year=2005|volume=1|issue=13|pages=1–33}}. Cf. [[Michel Weber]] and Will Desmond (eds.). ''[https://www.academia.edu/279955/Handbook_of_Whiteheadian_Process_Thought Handbook of Whiteheadian Process Thought]'' (Frankfurt / Lancaster, Ontos Verlag, Process Thought X1 &amp; X2, 2008) and Ronny Desmet &amp; Michel Weber (edited by), ''[https://www.academia.edu/279940/Whitehead._The_Algebra_of_Metaphysics Whitehead. The Algebra of Metaphysics. Applied Process Metaphysics Summer Institute Memorandum]'', Louvain-la-Neuve, Les Éditions Chromatika, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The formal [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] measurement of creativity, from the standpoint of orthodox [[Psychology|psychological]] literature, is usually considered to have begun with [[J. P. Guilford]]'s 1950 address to the [[American Psychological Association]], which helped popularize the topic&lt;ref name="Sternberg99"&gt;{{cite book |author=Sternberg, R. J. |author2=Lubart, T. I. |chapter=The Concept of Creativity: Prospects and Paradigms |editor=Sternberg, R. J. |title=Handbook of Creativity |year=1999 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |authorlink=Robert Sternberg |isbn=978-0-521-57285-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and focus attention on a scientific approach to conceptualizing creativity. (It should be noted that the London School of Psychology had instigated psychometric studies of creativity as early as 1927 with the work of H. L. Hargreaves into the Faculty of Imagination,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hargreaves | first1 = H. L. | year = 1927 | title = The faculty of imagination: An enquiry concerning the existence of a general faculty, or group factor, of imagination | url = | journal = British Journal of Psychology | volume = Monograph Supplement 3 | issue = | pages = 1–74 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it did not have the same impact.) Statistical analysis led to the recognition of creativity (as measured) as a separate aspect of human cognition to [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]]-type intelligence, into which it had previously been subsumed. Guilford's work suggested that above a threshold level of IQ, the relationship between creativity and classically measured intelligence broke down.&lt;ref name="Kozbelt"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kozbelt|first=Aaron|title=The Cambridge Handbook of Creativity|year=2010|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-73025-9 |author2=Beghetto, Ronald A. |author3=Runco, Mark A.|editor=[[James C. Kaufman]] |editor2=Robert J. Sternberg|chapter=Theories of Creativity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Four C" model ===
[[James C. Kaufman]] and Beghetto introduced a "four C" model of creativity; ''mini-c'' ("transformative learning" involving "personally meaningful interpretations of experiences, actions, and insights"), ''little-c'' (everyday problem solving and creative expression), ''Pro-C'' (exhibited by people who are professionally or vocationally creative though not necessarily eminent) and ''Big-C'' (creativity considered great in the given field). This model was intended to help accommodate models and theories of creativity that stressed competence as an essential component and the historical transformation of a creative domain as the highest mark of creativity. It also, the authors argued, made a useful framework for analyzing creative processes in individuals.&lt;ref name="KaufBeg2009"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/a0013688|last=Kaufman|first=James C.|author2=Beghetto, Ronald A.|title=Beyond Big and Little: The Four C Model of Creativity|journal=[[Review of General Psychology]]|year=2009|volume=13|issue=1|pages=1–12|authorlink=James C. Kaufman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contrast of terms "Big C" and "Little c" has been widely used. Kozbelt, Beghetto and Runco use a little-c/Big-C model to review major theories of creativity.&lt;ref name=Kozbelt /&gt; [[Margaret Boden]] distinguishes between h-creativity (historical) and p-creativity (personal).&lt;ref name="Boden2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boden|first=Margaret|title=The Creative Mind: Myths And Mechanisms|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-297-82069-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Craft makes a similar distinction between "high" and "little c" creativity.&lt;ref name="Craft1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Craft|first=Anna|title=Creativity in education|year=2001|publisher=Continuum International|isbn=978-0-8264-4863-7 |editor=Craft, A. |editor2=Jeffrey, B. |editor3=Leibling, M. |chapter='Little C' creativity}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cites [[Ken Robinson (educationalist)|Ken Robinson]] as referring to "high" and "democratic" creativity. [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi]]&lt;ref name="Csik1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Csíkszentmihályi |first=Mihály|title=Creativity:Flow and the Psychology of Discovery and Invention|year=1996|publisher=Harper Collins|isbn=978-0-06-092820-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; has defined creativity in terms of those individuals judged to have made significant creative, perhaps domain-changing contributions. Simonton has analysed the career trajectories of eminent creative people in order to map patterns and predictors of creative productivity.&lt;ref name="Simonton97"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.104.1.66|last=Simonton|first=D.

== Theories of creative processes ==
There has been much empirical study in [[psychology]] and [[cognitive science]] of the processes through which creativity occurs. Interpretation of the results of these studies has led to several possible explanations of the sources and methods of creativity.

=== Incubation ===
Incubation is a temporary break from [[creative problem solving]] that can result in insight.&lt;ref name="EoC Incubation"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=S. M.|title=Encyclopedia of Creativity Volume I|year=2011|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-375039-6|pages=653–657|edition=2nd|editor=M. A. Runco |editor2=S. R. Pritzker|chapter=Incubation}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been some empirical research looking at whether, as the concept of "incubation" in [[Graham Wallas|Wallas]]' model implies, a period of interruption or rest from a problem may aid creative problem-solving. Ward&lt;ref name="Ward2003"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ward, T. |year=2003 |chapter=Creativity |editor= Nagel, L. |title=Encyclopaedia of Cognition |location=New York |publisher=Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt; lists various hypotheses that have been advanced to explain why incubation may aid creative problem-solving, and notes how some [[empirical evidence]] is consistent with the hypothesis that incubation aids creative problem-solving in that it enables "forgetting" of misleading clues. Absence of incubation may lead the problem solver to become [[fixation (psychology)|fixated]] on inappropriate strategies of solving the problem.&lt;ref name="Smith1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Steven M.|title=The Creative Cognition Approach|year=1995|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|editor=Steven M. Smith |editor2=Thomas B. Ward |editor3=Ronald A. Finke|chapter=Fixation, Incubation, and Insight in Memory and Creative Thinking}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work disputes the earlier hypothesis that creative solutions to problems arise mysteriously from the unconscious mind while the conscious mind is occupied on other tasks.&lt;ref name=Anderson2000&gt;"{{cite book |author=Anderson, J. R. |year=2000 |title=Cognitive psychology and its implications |publisher=Worth Publishers |isbn=978-0-7167-1686-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
This earlier hypothesis is discussed in [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi|Csikszentmihalyi]]'s five phase model of the creative process which describes incubation as a time that your unconscious takes over. This allows for unique connections to be made without your consciousness trying to make logical order out of the problem.&lt;ref&gt;Csikszentmihalyi, Mihaly (1996). ''Creativity : Flow and the Psychology of Discovery and Invention.'' New York: Harper Perennial. {{ISBN|0-06-092820-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Convergent and divergent thinking ===
[[J. P. Guilford]]&lt;ref name="Guilford67"&gt;{{cite book |author=Guilford, J. P. |year=1967 |title=The Nature of Human Intelligence |authorlink=J. P. Guilford}}&lt;/ref&gt; drew a distinction between convergent and divergent production (commonly renamed [[convergent thinking|convergent]] and [[divergent thinking]]). Convergent thinking involves aiming for a single, correct solution to a problem, whereas divergent thinking involves creative generation of multiple answers to a set problem. Divergent thinking is sometimes used as a synonym for creativity in psychology literature. Other researchers have occasionally used the terms ''flexible'' thinking or [[fluid and crystallized intelligence|fluid intelligence]], which are roughly similar to (but not synonymous with) creativity.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

=== Creative cognition approach ===
In 1992, Finke et al. proposed the "Geneplore" model, in which creativity takes place in two phases: a generative phase, where an individual constructs mental representations called preinventive structures, and an exploratory phase where those structures are used to come up with creative ideas. Some evidence shows that when people use their imagination to develop new ideas, those ideas are heavily structured in predictable ways by the properties of existing categories and concepts.&lt;ref name="Ward1995"&gt;Ward, T.B. (1995). What’s old about new ideas. In S. M. Smith, T. B. Ward &amp; R. A. &amp; Finke (Eds.) ''The creative cognition approach'', 157–178, London: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Weisberg&lt;ref name="Weisberg93"&gt;{{cite book |author=Weisberg, R. W. |year=1993 |title=Creativity: Beyond the myth of genius |publisher=Freeman |isbn=978-0-7167-2119-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued, by contrast, that creativity only involves ordinary cognitive processes yielding extraordinary results.

=== The Explicit–Implicit Interaction (EII) theory ===
Helie and Sun&lt;ref name="HelieSun2010"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Helie S. |author2=Sun R. | year = 2010 | title = Incubation, insight, and creative problem solving: A unified theory and a connectionist model | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 117 | issue = 3| pages = 994–1024 | doi=10.1037/a0019532 | pmid=20658861|citeseerx=10.1.1.405.2245 }}&lt;/ref&gt; recently proposed a unified framework for understanding [[creative problem-solving|creativity in problem solving]], namely the Explicit–Implicit Interaction (EII) theory of creativity. This new theory constitutes an attempt at providing a more unified explanation of relevant phenomena (in part by reinterpreting/integrating various fragmentary existing theories of [[Incubation (psychology)|incubation]] and [[insight]]).

The EII theory relies mainly on five basic principles, namely:
# The co-existence of and the difference between explicit and implicit knowledge; 
# The simultaneous involvement of implicit and explicit processes in most tasks; 
# The redundant representation of explicit and implicit knowledge; 
# The integration of the results of explicit and implicit processing;
# The iterative (and possibly bidirectional) processing. 
A computational implementation of the theory was developed based on the [[CLARION (cognitive architecture)|CLARION cognitive architecture]] and used to simulate relevant human data. This work represents an initial step in the development of process-based theories of creativity encompassing incubation, insight, and various other related phenomena.

=== Conceptual blending ===
{{Main|Conceptual blending}}
In ''[[The Act of Creation]]'', [[Arthur Koestler]] introduced the concept of ''bisociation'' — that creativity arises as a result of the intersection of two quite different frames of reference.&lt;ref name="Koestler64"&gt;{{cite book |author=Koestler, A. |title=The Act of Creation |year=1964 |authorlink=Arthur Koestler |isbn=978-0-330-73116-4 |publisher=Pan Books |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea was later developed into conceptual blending. In the 1990s, various approaches in cognitive science that dealt with [[metaphor]], [[analogy]], and [[structure mapping]] have been converging, and a new integrative approach to the study of creativity in science, art and humor has emerged under the label [[conceptual blending]].

=== Honing theory ===
Honing theory, developed principally by psychologist [[Liane Gabora]], posits that creativity arises due to the self-organizing, self-mending nature of a worldview. The creative process is a way in which the individual hones (and re-hones) an integrated worldview. Honing theory places emphasis not only on the externally visible creative outcome but also the internal cognitive restructuring and repair of the worldview brought about by the creative process. When faced with a creatively demanding task, there is an interaction between the conception of the task and the worldview. The conception of the task changes through interaction with the worldview, and the worldview changes through interaction with the task. This interaction is reiterated until the task is complete, at which point not only is the task conceived of differently, but the worldview is subtly or drastically transformed as it follows the natural tendency of a worldview to attempt to resolve dissonance and seek internal consistency amongst its components, whether they be ideas, attitudes, or bits of knowledge.

A central feature of honing theory is the notion of a potentiality state.&lt;ref&gt;Gabora, L. &amp; Saab, A. (2011). Creative interference and states of potentiality in analogy problem solving. ''Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society''. July 20–23, 2011, Boston MA.&lt;/ref&gt; Honing theory posits that creative thought proceeds not by searching through and randomly ‘mutating’ predefined possibilities, but by drawing upon associations that exist due to overlap in the distributed neural cell assemblies that participate in the encoding of experiences in memory. Midway through the creative process one may have made associations between the current task and previous experiences, but not yet disambiguated which aspects of those previous experiences are relevant to the current task. Thus the creative idea may feel ‘half-baked’. It is at that point that it can be said to be in a potentiality state, because how it will actualize depends on the different internally or externally generated contexts it interacts with.

Honing theory is held to explain certain phenomena not dealt with by other theories of creativity, for example, how different works by the same creator are observed in studies to exhibit a recognizable style or 'voice' even through in different creative outlets. This is not predicted by theories of creativity that emphasize chance processes or the accumulation of expertise, but it is predicted by honing theory, according to which personal style reflects the creator's uniquely structured worldview. Another example is in the environmental stimulus for creativity. Creativity is commonly considered to be fostered by a supportive, nurturing, trustworthy environment conducive to self-actualization. However, research shows that creativity is also associated with childhood adversity, which would stimulate honing.

=== Everyday imaginative thought ===
In everyday thought, people often spontaneously imagine alternatives to reality when they think "if only...".&lt;ref&gt;Roese, N. J. &amp; Olson, J. M. (1995). ''What Might Have Been: The Social Psychology of Counterfactual Thinking''. Mahwah, New Jersey: Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt; Their [[counterfactual thinking]] is viewed as an example of everyday creative processes.&lt;ref&gt;Markman, K. Klein, W. &amp; Suhr, E. (eds) (2009). ''Handbook of mental simulation and the human imagination.'' Hove, Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proposed that the creation of counterfactual alternatives to reality depends on similar cognitive processes to rational thought.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ruth M. J. Byrne|Byrne, R. M. J.]] (2005). The Rational Imagination: How People Create Counterfactual Alternatives to Reality. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assessing individual creative ability ==
=== Creativity quotient ===
There was a ''creativity quotient'' developed similar to the [[intelligence quotient]] (IQ). It makes use of the results of divergent thinking tests (see below) by processing them further. It gives more weight to ideas that are radically different from other ideas in the response.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Snyder|first=Allan|date=2004|title=The creativity quotient: An objective scoring of ideational fluency|journal=Creativity Research Journal|volume=16|issue=4|pages=415–419|doi=10.1080/10400410409534552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychometric approach ===
[[J. P. Guilford]]'s group,&lt;ref name="Guilford67" /&gt; which pioneered the modern [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] study of creativity, constructed several tests to measure creativity in 1967:
* Plot Titles, where participants are given the plot of a story and asked to write original titles.
* Quick Responses is a word-association test scored for uncommonness.
* Figure Concepts, where participants were given simple drawings of objects and individuals and asked to find qualities or features that are common by two or more drawings; these were scored for uncommonness.
* Unusual Uses is finding unusual uses for common everyday objects such as bricks.
* Remote Associations, where participants are asked to find a word between two given words (e.g. Hand _____ Call)
* Remote Consequences, where participants are asked to generate a list of consequences of unexpected events (e.g. loss of gravity)

Building on Guilford's work, [[Ellis Paul Torrance|Torrance]]&lt;ref&gt;(Torrance, 1974)&lt;/ref&gt; developed the [[Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://people.uncw.edu/caropresoe/GiftedFoundations/SocialEmotional/Creativity-articles/Kim_Can-we-trust-creativity-tests.pdf|title=Can We Trust Creativity Tests?|author=Kim, Kyung Hee|year=2006|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|volume=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; They involved simple tests of divergent thinking and other problem-solving skills, which were scored on:
* '''Fluency''' – The total number of interpretable, meaningful, and relevant ideas generated in response to the stimulus.
* '''Originality''' – The statistical rarity of the responses among the test subjects.
* '''Elaboration''' – The amount of detail in the responses.

Such tests, sometimes called ''Divergent Thinking (DT)'' tests have been both supported&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kim | first1 = K.

Considerable progress has been made in automated scoring of [[divergent thinking]] tests using semantic approach. When compared to human raters, [[Natural language processing|NLP]] techniques were shown to be reliable and valid in scoring the originality.&lt;ref&gt;Forster, E. A., &amp; Dunbar, K. N. (2009). Creativity evaluation through latent semantic analysis. In Proceedings of the 31st Annual meeting of the Cognitive Science Society (pp. 602–607).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harbison, I. J., &amp; Haarmann, H. (2014). Automated scoring of originality using semantic representations. In Proceedings of the 36th Annual meeting of the Cognitive Science Society (poster paper).&lt;/ref&gt; The reported computer programs were able to achieve a correlation of 0.60 and 0.72 respectively to human graders.

Semantic networks were also used to devise originality scores that yielded significant correlations with socio-personal measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Acar | first1 = S. | last2 = Runco | first2 = M.

=== Social-personality approach ===
Some researchers have taken a social-personality approach to the measurement of creativity. In these studies, personality traits such as independence of judgement, self-confidence, attraction to complexity, aesthetic orientation, and risk-taking are used as measures of the creativity of individuals.&lt;ref name="Sternberg99" /&gt; A [[meta-analysis]] by Gregory Feist showed that creative people tend to be "more open to new experiences, less conventional and less conscientious, more self-confident, self-accepting, driven, ambitious, dominant, hostile, and impulsive." Openness, conscientiousness, self-acceptance, hostility, and impulsivity had the strongest effects of the traits listed.&lt;ref name=Feist /&gt; Within the framework of the [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five]] model of personality, some consistent traits have emerged.&lt;ref name="Batey, M. 2006 p. 355-429"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Batey | first1 = M. | last2 = Furnham | first2 = A. | year = 2006 | title = Creativity, intelligence and personality: A critical review of the scattered literature | url = | journal = Genetic, Social, and General Psychology Monographs | volume = 132 | issue = 4| pages = 355–429 | doi=10.3200/mono.132.4.355-430}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Openness to experience]] has been shown to be consistently related to a whole host of different assessments of creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Batey | first1 = M. | last2 = Furnham | first2 = A.

Compared to non-artists, artists tend to have higher levels of openness to experience and lower levels of conscientiousness, while scientists are more open to experience, [[Conscientiousness|conscientious]], and higher in the confidence-dominance facets of extraversion compared to non-scientists.&lt;ref name=Feist&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Feist | first1 = G.

=== Self-report questionnaires ===
An alternative are biographical methods. These methods use quantitative characteristics such as the number of publications, patents, or performances of a work. While this method was originally developed for highly creative personalities, today it is also available as [[Self-report study#Questionnaires and interviews|self-report questionnaires]] supplemented with frequent, less outstanding creative behaviors such as writing a short story or creating your own recipes. For example, the [[Creativity Achievement Questionnaire|Creative Achievement Questionnaire]], a self-report test that measures creative achievement across 10 domains, was described in 2005 and shown to be reliable and valid when compared to other measures of creativity and to independent evaluation of creative output.&lt;ref&gt;(Carson, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the English original, it was also used in a Chinese,&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ying-Yao|first=Wang, Chia-Chi{{!}}Ho, Hsiao-Chi{{!}}Cheng, Chih-Ling{{!}}Cheng|date=2014-00-00|title=Application of the Rasch Model to the Measurement of Creativity: The Creative Achievement Questionnaire.|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1088863|journal=Creativity Research Journal|language=en|volume=26|issue=1|issn=1040-0419}}&lt;/ref&gt; French,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bendetowicz|first=David|last2=Urbanski|first2=Marika|last3=Aichelburg|first3=Clarisse|last4=Levy|first4=Richard|last5=Volle|first5=Emmanuelle|date=2017-01|title=Brain morphometry predicts individual creative potential and the ability to combine remote ideas|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0010945216303161|journal=Cortex|volume=86|pages=216–229|doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2016.10.021|pmid=27919546|issn=0010-9452}}&lt;/ref&gt; and German-speaking&lt;ref name="Form 440–450"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Form|first=Sven|last2=Schlichting|first2=Kerrin|last3=Kaernbach|first3=Christian|date=2017-11|title=Mentoring functions: Interpersonal tensions are associated with mentees' creative achievement.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|language=en|volume=11|issue=4|pages=440–450|doi=10.1037/aca0000103|issn=1931-390X}}&lt;/ref&gt; version.

== Creativity and intelligence ==
The potential relationship between creativity and [[intelligence]] has been of interest since the late 1900s, when a multitude of influential studies – from Getzels &amp; Jackson,&lt;ref name="Getzels, J. W. 1962"&gt;Getzels, J. W., &amp; Jackson, P. W. (1962). Creativity and intelligence: Explorations with gifted students. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Barron,&lt;ref name="Barron, F. 1963"&gt;Barron, F. (1963). Creativity and psychological health. Princeton: D. Van Nostrand Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallach &amp; Kogan,&lt;ref name="Wallach, M. A. 1965"&gt;Wallach, M. A., &amp; Kogan, N. (1965). Modes of thinking in young children: A study of the creativity-intelligence distinction. New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston.&lt;/ref&gt; and Guilford&lt;ref name="Guilford, J. P. 1967"&gt;Guilford, J. P. (1967). The nature of human intelligence. New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; – focused not only on creativity, but also on intelligence. This joint focus highlights both the theoretical and practical importance of the relationship: researchers are interested not only if the constructs are related, but also how and why.&lt;ref&gt;Plucker, J., &amp; Renzulli, J. S. (1999). Psychometric approaches to the study of human creativity. In R. J. Sternberg (Ed.), Handbook of creativity (pp. 35–60). New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are multiple theories accounting for their relationship, with the 3 main theories as follows:

*Threshold Theory – Intelligence is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for creativity. There is a moderate positive relationship between creativity and intelligence until IQ ~120.&lt;ref name="Barron, F. 1963" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guilford, J. P. 1967" /&gt;
*Certification Theory – Creativity is not intrinsically related to intelligence. Instead, individuals are required to meet the requisite level intelligence in order to gain a certain level of education/work, which then in turn offers the opportunity to be creative. Displays of creativity are moderated by intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, J. R. (1989). Cognitive processes in creativity. In J. A. Glover, R. R. Ronning, &amp; C. R. Reynolds (Eds.), Handbook of creativity (pp. 135–145). New York: Plenum.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Interference Theory – Extremely high intelligence might interfere with creative ability.&lt;ref name="Sternberg, R. J. 1996"&gt;Sternberg, R. J. (1996). Successful Intelligence. NewYork: Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sternberg and O’Hara&lt;ref name="Sternberg, R. J. 1999 pp. 251"&gt;Sternberg, R. J., &amp; O’Hara, L. A. (1999). Creativity and intelligence. In R. J. Sternberg (Ed.), Handbook of creativity (pp. 251–272). Cambridge, MA: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a framework of 5 possible relationships between creativity and intelligence:
#Creativity is a subset of intelligence
#Intelligence is a subset of creativity
#Creativity and intelligence are overlapping constructs
#Creativity and intelligence are part of the same construct (coincident sets)
#Creativity and intelligence are distinct constructs (disjoint sets)

=== Creativity as a subset of intelligence ===
A number of researchers include creativity, either explicitly or implicitly, as a key component of intelligence.

''Examples of theories that include creativity as a subset of intelligence''

*Gardner’s  [[Theory of multiple intelligences]] (MIT)&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, H. (1993). Creating minds. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; – implicitly includes creativity as a subset of MIT. To demonstrate this, Gardner cited examples of different famous creators, each of whom differed in their types of intelligences e.g. Picasso (spatial intelligence); Freud (intrapersonal); Einstein (logical-mathematical); and Gandhi (interpersonal).
*Sternberg’s Theory of Successful intelligence&lt;ref name="Sternberg, R. J. 1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sternberg, R. J. 1999 pp. 251" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sternberg, R. J., Kaufman, J. C., &amp; Grigorenko, E. L. (2008). Applied intelligence. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Triarchic theory of intelligence]]) includes creativity as a main component, and comprises 3 sub-theories: Componential (Analytic), Contextual (Practical), and Experiential (Creative). Experiential sub-theory – the ability to use pre-existing knowledge and skills to solve new and novel problems – is directly related to creativity.
*The [[Cattell–Horn–Carroll theory]] includes creativity as a subset of intelligence. Specifically, it is associated with the broad group factor of long-term storage and retrieval (Glr). Glr narrow abilities relating to creativity include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kaufman | first1 = J. C. | last2 = Kaufman | first2 = S. B. | last3 = Lichtenberger | first3 = E. O. | year = 2011 | title = Finding creativity on intelligence tests via divergent production | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of School Psychology | volume = 26 | issue = | pages = 83–106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ideational fluency, associational fluency, and originality/creativity. Silvia et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Silvia | first1 = P. J. | last2 = Beaty | first2 = R. E. | last3 = Nusbaum | first3 = E.

Martindale&lt;ref&gt;Martindale, C. (1999). Biological bases of creativity. In R. J. Sternberg (Ed.), Handbook of creativity (pp. 137– 152). New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; extended the CHC-theory in the sense that it was proposed that those individuals who are creative are also selective in their processing speed Martindale argues that in the creative process, larger amounts of information are processed more slowly in the early stages, and as the individual begins to understand the problem, the processing speed is increased.
*The Dual Process Theory of Intelligence&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, J.C., Kaufman, S.B., &amp; Plucker, J.A. (2013). Contemporary theories of intelligence. In J. Reisberg (Ed.), The Oxford Handbook of Cognitive Psychology (pp. 811-822). New York, NY: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; posits a two-factor/type model of intelligence. Type 1 is a conscious process, and concerns goal directed thoughts, which are explained by ''g''. Type 2 is an unconscious process, and concerns spontaneous cognition, which encompasses daydreaming and implicit learning ability. Kaufman argues that creativity occurs as a result of Type 1 and Type 2 processes working together in combination. The use of each type in the creative process can be used to varying degrees.

=== Intelligence as a subset of creativity ===
In this relationship model, intelligence is a key component in the development of creativity.

''Theories of creativity that include intelligence as a subset of creativity''

*Sternberg &amp; Lubart’s Investment Theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sternberg | first1 = R. J. | last2 = Lubart | first2 = T. I. | year = 1991 | title = An investment theory of creativity and its development | url = | journal = Human Development | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 1–32 | doi=10.1159/000277029}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sternberg | first1 = R. J. | last2 = Lubart | first2 = T. I. | year = 1992 | title = Buy low and sell high: An investment approach to creativity | url = | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 1 | issue = 1| pages = 1–5 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.1992.tb00002.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the metaphor of a stock market, they demonstrate that creative thinkers are like good investors – they buy low and sell high (in their ideas). Like under/low-valued stock, creative individuals generate unique ideas that are initially rejected by other people. The creative individual has to persevere, and convince the others of the ideas value. After convincing the others, and thus increasing the ideas value, the creative individual ‘sells high’ by leaving the idea with the other people, and moves onto generating another idea. According to this theory, six distinct, but related elements contribute to successful creativity: intelligence, knowledge, thinking styles, personality, motivation, and environment. Intelligence is just one of the six factors that can either solely, or in conjunction with the other five factors, generate creative thoughts.
*Amabile’s Componential Model of Creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Amabile | first1 = T. M. | year = 1982 | title = Social psychology of creativity: A consensual assessment technique | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 43 | issue = 5| pages = 997–1013 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.43.5.997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amabile, T. M. (1996). Creativity in context: Update to "The Social Psychology of Creativity". Boulder: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, there are 3 within-individual components needed for creativity – domain-relevant skills, creativity-relevant processes, and task motivation – and 1 component external to the individual: their surrounding social environment. Creativity requires a confluence of all components. High creativity will result when an individual is: intrinsically motivated, possesses both a high level of domain-relevant skills and has high skills in creative thinking, and is working in a highly creative environment.
*Amusement Park Theoretical Model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baer | first1 = J. | last2 = Kaufman | first2 = J. C. | year = 2005 | title = Bridging generality and specificity: The Amusement Park Theoretical (APT) Model of creativity | url = | journal = Roeper Review | volume = 27 | issue = 3| pages = 158–163 | doi=10.1080/02783190509554310}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this 4-step theory, both domain-specific and generalist views are integrated into a model of creativity. The researchers make use of the metaphor of the amusement park to demonstrate that within each of these creative levels, intelligence plays a key role:
**To get into the amusement park, there are initial requirements (e.g., time/transport to go to the park). Initial requirements (like intelligence) are necessary, but not sufficient for creativity. They are more like prerequisites for creativity, and if an individual does not possess the basic level of the initial requirement (intelligence), then they will not be able to generate creative thoughts/behaviour.
**Secondly are the subcomponents – general thematic areas – that increase in specificity. Like choosing which type of amusement park to visit (e.g. a zoo or a water park), these areas relate to the areas in which someone could be creative (e.g. poetry).
**Thirdly, there are specific domains. After choosing the type of park to visit e.g. waterpark, you then have to choose which specific park to go to. Within the poetry domain, there are many different types (e.g. free verse, riddles, sonnet, etc.) that have to be selected from.
**Lastly, there are micro-domains. These are the specific tasks that reside within each domain e.g. individual lines in a free verse poem / individual rides at the waterpark.

=== Creativity and intelligence as overlapping yet distinct constructs ===
This possible relationship concerns creativity and intelligence as distinct, but intersecting constructs.

''Theories that include Creativity and Intelligence as Overlapping Yet Distinct Constructs''

*Renzulli’s Three-Ring Conception of Giftedness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Renzulli | first1 = J. S. | year = 1978 | title = What makes giftedness? Reexamining a definition | url = | journal = Phi Delta Kappan | volume = 60 | issue = | pages = 180–261 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this conceptualisation, giftedness occurs as a result from the overlap of above average intellectual ability, creativity, and task commitment. Under this view, creativity and intelligence are distinct constructs, but they do overlap under the correct conditions.
*[[PASS theory of intelligence]]. In this theory, the planning component – relating to the ability to solve problems, make decisions and take action – strongly overlaps with the concept of creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Naglieri | first1 = J. A. | last2 = Kaufman | first2 = J. C. | year = 2001 | title = Understanding intelligence, giftedness, and creativity using PASS theory | url = | journal = Roeper Review | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 151–156 | doi=10.1080/02783190109554087}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Threshold Theory (TT). A number of previous research findings have suggested that a threshold exists in the relationship between creativity and intelligence – both constructs are moderately positively correlated up to an IQ of ~120. Above this threshold of an IQ of 120, if there is a relationship at all, it is small and weak.&lt;ref name="Getzels, J. W. 1962" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barron, F. 1963" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Torrance, E. P. (1962). Guiding creative talent. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; TT posits that a moderate level of intelligence is necessary for creativity.

In support of the TT, Barron&lt;ref name="Barron, F. 1963" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barron, F. (1969). Creative person and creative process. New York: Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston.&lt;/ref&gt; reported finding a non-significant correlation between creativity and intelligence in a gifted sample; and a significant correlation in a non-gifted sample. Yamamoto&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yamamoto | first1 = K | year = 1964 | title = Creativity and sociometric choice among adolescents | url = | journal = Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 64 | issue = 2| pages = 249–261 | doi=10.1080/00224545.1964.9919564| pmid = 14238998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in a sample of secondary school children, reported a significant correlation between creativity and intelligence of ''r'' = .3, and reported no significant correlation when the sample consisted of gifted children. Fuchs-Beauchamp et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fuchs-Beauchamp | first1 = K. D. | last2 = Karnes | first2 = M. B. | last3 = Johnson | first3 = L.

Cho et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cho | first1 = S. H. | last2 = Nijenhuis | first2 = J. T. | last3 = van Vianen | first3 = N. E.

Jauk et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jauk | first1 = E. | last2 = Benedek | first2 = M. | last3 = Dunst | first3 = B. | last4 = Neubauer | first4 = A.

Much modern day research reports findings against TT. Wai et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wai | first1 = J. | last2 = Lubinski | first2 = D. | last3 = Benbow | first3 = C. P. | year = 2005 | title = Creativity and occupational accomplishments among intellectually precocious youths: An age 13 to age 33 longitudinal study | url = | journal = Journal of Educational Psychology | volume = 97 | issue = 3| pages = 484–492 | doi=10.1037/0022-0663.97.3.484}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a study using data from the longitudinal Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth – a cohort of elite students from early adolescence into adulthood – found that differences in SAT scores at age 13 were predictive of creative real-life outcomes 20 years later. Kim’s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kim | first1 = K. H. | year = 2005 | title = Can only intelligent people be creative? | url = | journal = Journal of Secondary Gifted Education | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 57–66 }}&lt;/ref&gt; meta-analysis of 21 studies did not find any supporting evidence for TT, and instead negligible correlations were reported between intelligence, creativity, and divergent thinking both below and above IQ's of 120. Preckel et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Preckel | first1 = F. | last2 = Holling | first2 = H. | last3 = Wiese | first3 = M. | year = 2006 | title = Relationship of intelligence and creativity in gifted and non-gifted students: An investigation of threshold theory | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 40 | issue = | pages = 159–170 | doi=10.1016/j.paid.2005.06.022}}&lt;/ref&gt; investigating fluid intelligence and creativity, reported small correlations of ''r'' = .3 to ''r'' = .4 across all levels of cognitive ability.

=== Creativity and intelligence as coincident sets ===
Under this view, researchers posit that there are no differences in the mechanisms underlying creativity in those used in normal problem solving; and in normal problem solving, there is no need for creativity. Thus, creativity and Intelligence (problem solving) are the same thing. Perkins&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, D. N. (1981) The mind’s best work. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; referred to this as the ‘nothing-special’ view.

Weisberg &amp; Alba&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weisberg | first1 = R. W. | last2 = Alba | first2 = J. W. | year = 1981 | title = An examination of the alleged role of "fixation" in the solution of several "insight" problems | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: General | volume = 110 | issue = 2| pages = 169–192 | doi=10.1037/0096-3445.110.2.169}}&lt;/ref&gt; examined problem solving by having participants complete the 9-dot problem (see [[Thinking outside the box#Nine dots puzzle]]) – where the participants are asked to connect all 9 dots in the 3 rows of 3 dots using 4 straight lines or less, without lifting their pen or tracing the same line twice. The problem can only be solved if the lines go outside the boundaries of the square of dots. Results demonstrated that even when participants were given this insight, they still found it difficult to solve the problem, thus showing that to successfully complete the task it is not just insight (or creativity) that is required.

=== Creativity and intelligence as disjoint sets ===
In this view, creativity and intelligence are completely different, unrelated constructs.

Getzels and Jackson&lt;ref name="Getzels, J. W. 1962" /&gt; administered 5 creativity measures to a group of 449 children from grades 6-12, and compared these test findings to results from previously administered (by the school) IQ tests. They found that the correlation between the creativity measures and IQ was ''r'' = .26. The high creativity group scored in the top 20% of the overall creativity measures, but were not included in the top 20% of IQ scorers. The high intelligence group scored the opposite: they scored in the top 20% for IQ, but were outside the top 20% scorers for creativity, thus showing that creativity and intelligence are distinct and unrelated.

However, this work has been heavily criticised. Wallach and Kogan&lt;ref name="Wallach, M. A. 1965" /&gt; highlighted that the creativity measures were not only weakly related to one another (to the extent that they were no more related to one another than they were with IQ), but they seemed to also draw upon non-creative skills. McNemar&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McNemar | first1 = O | year = 1964 | title = Lost: Our Intelligence? Why? | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 19 | issue = 12| pages = 871–882 | doi=10.1037/h0042008}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted that there were major measurement issues, in that the IQ scores were a mixture from 3 different IQ tests.

Wallach and Kogan&lt;ref name="Wallach, M. A. 1965" /&gt; administered 5 measures of creativity, each of which resulted in a score for originality and fluency; and 10 measures of general intelligence to 151 5th grade children. These tests were untimed, and given in a game-like manner (aiming to facilitate creativity). Inter-correlations between creativity tests were on average ''r'' = .41. Inter-correlations between intelligence measures were on average ''r'' = .51 with each other. Creativity tests and intelligence measures correlated ''r'' = .09.

The authors write that "creative innovation might require coactivation and communication between regions of the brain that ordinarily are not strongly connected." Highly creative people who excel at creative innovation tend to differ from others in three ways:
* they have a high level of specialized knowledge,
* they are capable of [[convergent and divergent production|divergent thinking]] mediated by the [[frontal lobe]].
* and they are able to modulate [[neurotransmitter]]s such as [[norepinephrine]] in their frontal lobe.

Thus, the frontal lobe appears to be the part of the [[cerebral cortex|cortex]] that is most important for creativity.

This article also explored the links between creativity and sleep, [[mood disorder|mood]] and [[substance dependence|addiction disorders]], and [[depression (mood)|depression]].

In 2005, Alice Flaherty presented a three-factor model of the creative drive. Drawing from evidence in brain imaging, drug studies and lesion analysis, she described the creative drive as resulting from an interaction of the frontal lobes, the [[temporal lobe]]s, and [[dopamine]] from the [[limbic system]]. The frontal lobes can be seen as responsible for idea generation, and the temporal lobes for idea editing and evaluation. Abnormalities in the frontal lobe (such as depression or anxiety) generally decrease creativity, while abnormalities in the temporal lobe often increase creativity. High activity in the temporal lobe typically inhibits activity in the frontal lobe, and vice versa. High dopamine levels increase general [[arousal]] and goal directed behaviors and reduce [[latent inhibition]], and all three effects increase the drive to generate ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Flaherty AW | year = 2005 | title = Frontotemporal and dopaminergic control of idea generation and creative drive | url = | journal = J Comp Neurol | volume = 493 | issue = 1| pages = 147–53 | pmid = 16254989 | pmc = 2571074 | doi=10.1002/cne.20768}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2015 study on creativity found that it involves the interaction of multiple neural networks, including those that support associative thinking, along with other [[default mode network]] functions.&lt;ref name=PMID_26003860&gt;{{ cite journal |last1 = Mayseless |first1 = Naama |last2 = Eran |first2 = Ayelet |last3 = Shamay-Tsoory |first3 = Simone G |year = 2015 |title = Generating original ideas: The neural underpinning of originality. |journal = NeuroImage |quote = These results are in line with the dual model of creativity, according to which original ideas are a product of the interaction between a system that generates ideas and a control system that evaluates these ideas. |laysummary = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26003860 |doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.05.030|pmid = 26003860 |pages = 232–9 |volume = 116 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Working memory and the cerebellum ===
Vandervert&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert 2003a, 2003b; Vandervert, Schimpf &amp; Liu, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; described how the brain's frontal lobes and the cognitive functions of the [[cerebellum]] collaborate to produce creativity and innovation. Vandervert's explanation rests on considerable evidence that all processes of [[working memory]] (responsible for processing all thought&lt;ref&gt;Miyake &amp; Shah, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;) are adaptively modeled for increased efficiency by the cerebellum.&lt;ref&gt;Schmahmann, 1997, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The cerebellum (consisting of 100 billion neurons, which is more than the entirety of the rest of the brain&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, Korbo &amp; Pakkenberg, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;) is also widely known to adaptively model all bodily movement for efficiency. The cerebellum's adaptive models of working memory processing are then fed back to especially frontal lobe working memory control processes&lt;ref&gt;Miller &amp; Cohen, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; where creative and innovative thoughts arise.&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert, 2003a&lt;/ref&gt; (Apparently, creative insight or the "aha" experience is then triggered in the temporal lobe.&lt;ref&gt;Jung-Beeman, Bowden, Haberman, Frymiare, Arambel-Liu, Greenblatt, Reber &amp; Kounios, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;)

According to Vandervert, the details of creative adaptation begin in "forward" cerebellar models which are anticipatory/exploratory controls for movement and thought. These cerebellar processing and control architectures have been termed Hierarchical Modular Selection and Identification for Control (HMOSAIC).&lt;ref&gt;Imamizu, Kuroda, Miyauchi, Yoshioka &amp; Kawato, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; New, hierarchically arranged levels of the cerebellar control architecture (HMOSAIC) develop as mental mulling in working memory is extended over time. These new levels of the control architecture are fed forward to the frontal lobes. Since the cerebellum adaptively models all movement and all levels of thought and emotion,&lt;ref&gt;Schmahmann, 2004,&lt;/ref&gt; Vandervert's approach helps explain creativity and innovation in sports, art, music, the design of video games, technology, mathematics, the [[child prodigy]], and thought in general.

Essentially, Vandervert has argued that when a person is confronted with a challenging new situation, visual-spatial working memory and speech-related working memory are decomposed and re-composed (fractionated) by the cerebellum and then blended in the cerebral cortex in an attempt to deal with the new situation. With repeated attempts to deal with challenging situations, the cerebro-cerebellar blending process continues to optimize the efficiency of how working memory deals with the situation or problem.&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert, in press-a&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently, he has argued that this is the same process (only involving visual-spatial working memory and pre-language vocalization) that led to the evolution of language in humans.&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert, 2011, in press-b&lt;/ref&gt; Vandervert and Vandervert-Weathers have pointed out that this blending process, because it continuously optimizes efficiencies, constantly improves prototyping attempts toward the invention or innovation of new ideas, music, art, or technology.&lt;ref&gt;Vandervert &amp; Vandervert-Weathers, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Prototyping, they argue, not only produces new products, it trains the cerebro-cerebellar pathways involved to become more efficient at prototyping itself. Further, Vandervert and Vandervert-Weathers believe that this repetitive "mental prototyping" or mental rehearsal involving the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex explains the success of the self-driven, individualized patterning of repetitions initiated by the teaching methods of the [[Khan Academy]]. The model proposed by Vandervert has, however, received incisive critique from several authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = J. | year = 2007 | title = On Vandervert et al.

=== REM sleep ===
Creativity involves the forming of associative elements into new combinations that are useful or meet some requirement. Sleep aids this process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature02223 |author1=Wagner U. |author2=Gais S. |author3=Haider H. |author4=Verleger R. |author5=Born J. | year = 2004 | title = Sleep inspires insight | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 427 | issue = 6972| pages = 352–5 | pmid = 14737168 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rapid eye movement sleep|REM]] rather than [[Non-rapid eye movement sleep|NREM sleep]] appears to be responsible.&lt;ref name="Cai"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0900271106 |author1=Cai D.

It is proposed that REM sleep adds creativity by allowing "neocortical structures to reorganize associative hierarchies, in which information from the hippocampus would be reinterpreted in relation to previous semantic representations or nodes."&lt;ref name="Cai" /&gt;

== Affect ==
Some theories suggest that creativity may be particularly susceptible to affective influence. As noted in [[voting behavior]], the term "affect" in this context can refer to liking or disliking key aspects of the subject in question. This work largely follows from findings in psychology regarding the ways in which affective states are involved in human judgment and decision-making.&lt;ref name=Winkielman2007&gt;{{Citation

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Positive affect relations ===
According to [[Alice M. Isen|Alice Isen]], positive affect has three primary effects on cognitive activity:
# Positive affect makes additional cognitive material available for processing, increasing the number of cognitive elements available for association;
# Positive affect leads to defocused attention and a more complex cognitive context, increasing the breadth of those elements that are treated as relevant to the problem;
# Positive affect increases cognitive flexibility, increasing the probability that diverse cognitive elements will in fact become associated. Together, these processes lead positive affect to have a positive influence on creativity.

[[Barbara Fredrickson]] in her [[broaden-and-build]] model suggests that positive emotions such as joy and love broaden a person's available repertoire of cognitions and actions, thus enhancing creativity.

According to these researchers, positive emotions increase the number of cognitive elements available for association (attention scope) and the number of elements that are relevant to the problem (cognitive scope).

Various meta-analyses, such as Baas et al. (2008) of 66 studies about creativity and affect support the link between creativity and positive affect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mark A.

== Creativity and artificial intelligence ==
[[Jürgen Schmidhuber]]'s formal [[theory]] of creativity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidhuber | first1 = Jürgen | year = 2006 | title = Developmental Robotics, Optimal Artificial Curiosity, Creativity, Music, and the Fine Arts | url = | journal = Connection Science | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 173–187 | doi=10.1080/09540090600768658| citeseerx = 10.1.1.474.6919 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidhuber | first1 = Jürgen | year = 2010 | title = Formal Theory of Creativity, Fun, and Intrinsic Motivation (1990–2010) | url = | journal = IEEE Transactions on Autonomous Mental Development | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 230–247 | doi=10.1109/tamd.2010.2056368}}&lt;/ref&gt; postulates that creativity, curiosity, and interestingness are by-products of a simple [[Computational learning theory|computational]] principle for measuring and optimizing learning progress. Consider an agent able to manipulate its environment and thus its own [[sensory system|sensory]] inputs. The agent can use a [[black box]] optimization method such as [[reinforcement learning]] to learn (through informed trial and error) sequences of actions that maximize the expected sum of its future [[reward system|reward]] signals. There are extrinsic reward signals for achieving externally given goals, such as finding food when hungry. But Schmidhuber's [[Loss function|objective function]] to be maximized also includes an additional, intrinsic term to model "wow-effects." This non-standard term motivates purely creative behavior of the agent even when there are no external goals. A wow-effect is formally defined as follows. As the agent is creating and predicting and encoding the continually growing history of actions and sensory inputs, it keeps improving the predictor or encoder, which can be implemented as an [[artificial neural network]] or some other [[machine learning]] device that can exploit regularities in the data to improve its performance over time. The improvements can be measured precisely, by computing the difference in computational costs (storage size, number of required synapses, errors, time) needed to encode new observations before and after learning. This difference depends on the encoder's present subjective knowledge, which changes over time, but the theory formally takes this into account. The cost difference measures the strength of the present "wow-effect" due to sudden improvements in [[data compression]] or computational speed. It becomes an intrinsic reward signal for the action selector. The objective function thus motivates the action optimizer to create action sequences causing more wow-effects. Irregular, random data (or noise) do not permit any wow-effects or learning progress, and thus are "boring" by nature (providing no reward). Already known and predictable regularities also are boring. Temporarily interesting are only the initially unknown, novel, regular patterns in both actions and observations. This motivates the agent to perform continual, open-ended, active, creative exploration.

According to Schmidhuber, his objective function explains the activities of scientists, artists, and [[comedian]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Video of [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]]'s keynote at the 2011 Winter Intelligence Conference, Oxford: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnbZzcruGu0 Universal AI and Theory of Fun and Creativity.

Youtube, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, [[physicist]]s are motivated to create experiments leading to observations obeying previously unpublished [[physical law]]s permitting better [[data compression]]. Likewise, composers receive intrinsic reward for creating non-arbitrary melodies with unexpected but regular harmonies that permit wow-effects through data compression improvements.
Similarly, a comedian gets intrinsic reward for "inventing a novel joke with an unexpected [[punch line]], related to the beginning of the story in an initially unexpected but quickly learnable way that also allows for better compression of the perceived data."&lt;ref&gt;Kurzweil AI: [http://www.kurzweilai.net/when-creative-machines-overtake-man Transcript] of [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]]'s TEDx talk (2012): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ35zNlyG-o&amp;list=PL194623EBA834DB77&amp;index=11 When creative machines overtake man]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mental health ==
{{Main|Creativity and mental illness}}
A study by psychologist [[J. Philippe Rushton]] found creativity to correlate with [[intelligence]] and [[psychoticism]].&lt;ref&gt;(Rushton, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found creativity to be greater in [[Schizotypal personality disorder|schizotypal]] than in either normal or [[Schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] individuals. While divergent thinking was associated with bilateral activation of the [[prefrontal cortex]], schizotypal individuals were found to have much greater activation of their ''right'' prefrontal cortex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.schres.2005.06.016 |pmid=16125369 |url=http://exploration.vanderbilt.edu/news/news_schizotypes.htm |accessdate=2006-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060215212520/http://exploration.vanderbilt.edu/news/news_schizotypes.htm |archivedate=2006-02-15 |df= |volume=80 |issue=2–3 |title=Verbal creativity and schizotypal personality in relation to prefrontal hemispheric laterality: A behavioral and near-infrared optical imaging study |year=2005 |journal=Schizophrenia Research |pages=271–282 | last1 = Folley | first1 = Bradley S. | last2 = Park | first2 = Sohee|pmc=2817946 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This study hypothesizes that such individuals are better at accessing both hemispheres, allowing them to make novel associations at a faster rate.

Particularly strong links have been identified between creativity and [[mood disorder]]s, particularly [[Bipolar disorder|manic-depressive disorder]] (a.k.a. [[bipolar disorder]]) and [[Major depressive disorder|depressive disorder]] (a.k.a. [[Major depressive disorder|unipolar disorder]]). In ''Touched with Fire: Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament'', [[Kay Redfield Jamison]] summarizes studies of mood-disorder rates in [[writer]]s, [[poet]]s, and [[artist]]s. She also explores research that identifies [[mood disorder]]s in such famous writers and artists as [[Ernest Hemingway]] (who shot himself after [[Electroconvulsive therapy|electroconvulsive treatment]]), [[Virginia Woolf]] (who drowned herself when she felt a depressive episode coming on), composer [[Robert Schumann]] (who died in a mental institution), and even the famed [[Visual arts|visual artist]] [[Michelangelo]]. A different case study suggested for Schumann a difference between bipolar disorder and "creative bipolarity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holm-Hadulla|first=Rainer Matthias|last2=Koutsoukou-Argyraki|first2=Asimina|date=2017|title=Bipolar Disorder and/or Creative Bipolarity: Robert Schumann's Exemplary Psychopathology - Combining Symptomatological and Psychosocial Perspectives with Creativity Research|url=https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/479883|journal=Psychopathology|language=english|volume=50|issue=6|pages=379–388|doi=10.1159/000479883|pmid=29017153|issn=0254-4962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study looking at 300,000 persons with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or unipolar depression, and their relatives, found overrepresentation in creative professions for those with bipolar disorder as well as for undiagnosed siblings of those with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.

There was no association for those with unipolar depression or their relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kyaga | first1 = S. | last2 = Lichtenstein | first2 = P. | last3 = Boman | first3 = M. | last4 = Hultman | first4 = C. | last5 = Långström | first5 = N. | last6 = Landén | first6 = M. | title = Creativity and mental disorder: Family study of 300 000 people with severe mental disorder | doi = 10.1192/bjp.bp.110.085316 | journal = The British Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 199 | issue = 5 | pages = 373–379 | year = 2011 | pmid =  21653945| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another case study suggested a difference between severe mood disorders and "creative melancholy", pointing out mild and moderate depression may inspire creative achievements while severe depression inhibits and may even destroy creative activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holm-Hadulla|first=Rainer M.|last2=Roussel|first2=Martin|last3=Hofmann|first3=Frank-Hagen|date=2010-12|title=Depression and creativity — The case of the german poet, scientist and statesman J.

Another study involving more than one million people, conducted by Swedish researchers at the Karolinska Institute, reported a number of correlations between creative occupations and mental illnesses. Writers had a higher risk of anxiety and bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, unipolar depression, and substance abuse, and were almost twice as likely as the general population to kill themselves. Dancers and photographers were also more likely to have bipolar disorder.&lt;ref name="bbc health-19959565"&gt;Roberts, Michelle. Creativity 'closely entwined with mental illness'. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-19959565. 16 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as a group, those in the creative professions were no more likely to suffer from psychiatric disorders than other people, although they were more likely to have a close relative with a disorder, including anorexia and, to some extent, autism, the Journal of Psychiatric Research reports.&lt;ref name="bbc health-19959565" /&gt;

According to psychologist Robert Epstein, PhD, creativity can be obstructed through stress.&lt;ref name="apa.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/gradpsych/2009/01/creativity.aspx|title=The science of creativity|website=apa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Creativity and personality ==
Creativity can be expressed in a number of different forms, depending on unique people and environments. A number of different theorists have suggested models of the creative person. One model suggests that there are kinds to produce growth, innovation, speed, etc. These are referred to as the four "Creativity Profiles" that can help achieve such goals.&lt;ref&gt;(DeGraff, Lawrence 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;
:(i) ''Incubate'' (Long-term Development)
:(ii) ''Imagine'' (Breakthrough Ideas)
:(iii) ''Improve'' (Incremental Adjustments)
:(iv) ''Invest'' (Short-term Goals)

Research by Dr Mark Batey of the Psychometrics at Work Research Group at [[Manchester Business School]] has suggested that the creative profile can be explained by four primary creativity traits with narrow facets within each

: (i) "Idea Generation" (Fluency, Originality, Incubation and Illumination)
: (ii) "Personality" (Curiosity and Tolerance for Ambiguity)
: (iii) "Motivation" (Intrinsic, Extrinsic and Achievement)
: (iv) "Confidence" (Producing, Sharing and Implementing)

This model was developed in a sample of 1000 working adults using the statistical techniques of Exploratory Factor Analysis followed by Confirmatory Factor Analysis by Structural Equation Modelling.&lt;ref&gt;(Batey &amp; Irwing, 2010) {{cite web |url=http://www.e-metrixx.com/creativity-profit/me2-spec/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710161255/http://www.e-metrixx.com/creativity-profit/me2-spec/ |archivedate=2011-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important aspect of the creativity profiling approach is to account for the tension between predicting the creative profile of an individual, as characterised by the [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] approach, and the evidence that team creativity is founded on diversity and difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Nijstad B. A. |author2=De Dreu C.

One characteristic of creative people, as measured by some psychologists, is what is called ''divergent production''. ''Divergent production'' is the ability of a person to generate a diverse assortment, yet an appropriate amount of responses to a given situation.&lt;ref&gt;(Guilford, 1950)&lt;/ref&gt; One way of measuring ''divergent production'' is by administering the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking.&lt;ref&gt;(Torrance, 1974, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt; The Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking assesses the diversity, quantity, and appropriateness of participants responses to a variety of open-ended questions.

Other researchers of creativity see the difference in creative people as a cognitive process of dedication to problem solving and developing expertise in the field of their creative expression. Hard working people study the work of people before them and within their current area, become experts in their fields, and then have the ability to add to and build upon previous information in innovative and creative ways. In a study of projects by design students, students who had more knowledge on their subject on average had greater creativity within their projects.&lt;ref&gt;(Christiaans &amp; Venselaar, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The aspect of motivation within a person's personality may predict creativity levels in the person. Motivation stems from two different sources, intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation is an internal drive within a person to participate or invest as a result of personal interest, desires, hopes, goals, etc. Extrinsic motivation is a drive from outside of a person and might take the form of payment, rewards, fame, approval from others, etc. Although extrinsic motivation and intrinsic motivation can both increase creativity in certain cases, strictly extrinsic motivation often impedes creativity in people.&lt;ref&gt;(Amabile, 1996; Prabhu et al., 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

From a personality-traits perspective, there are a number of traits that are associated with creativity in people.&lt;ref&gt;(Feist, 1998, 1999; Prabhu et al., 2008; Zhang &amp; Sternberg, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Creative people tend to be more open to new experiences, are more self-confident, are more ambitious, self-accepting, impulsive, driven, dominant, and hostile, compared to people with less creativity.

From an evolutionary perspective, creativity may be a result of the outcome of years of generating ideas. As ideas are continuously generated, the need to evolve produces a need for new ideas and developments. As a result, people have been creating and developing new, innovative, and creative ideas to build our progress as a society.&lt;ref&gt;(Campbell, 1960)&lt;/ref&gt;

In studying exceptionally creative people in history, some common traits in lifestyle and environment are often found. Creative people in history usually had supportive parents, but rigid and non-nurturing. Most had an interest in their field at an early age, and most had a highly supportive and skilled mentor in their field of interest. Often the field they chose was relatively uncharted, allowing for their creativity to be expressed more in a field with less previous information. Most exceptionally creative people devoted almost all of their time and energy into their craft, and after about a decade had a creative breakthrough of fame. Their lives were marked with extreme dedication and a cycle of hard-work and breakthroughs as a result of their determination.&lt;ref&gt;(Gardner, 1993a, Policastro &amp; Gardner, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another theory of creative people is the ''investment theory of creativity''. This approach suggest that there are many individual and environmental factors that must exist in precise ways for extremely high levels of creativity opposed to average levels of creativity. In the ''investment'' sense, a person with their particular characteristics in their particular environment may see an opportunity to devote their time and energy into something that has been overlooked by others. The creative person develops an undervalued or under-recognised idea to the point that it is established as a new and creative idea. Just like in the financial world, some investments are worth the buy in, while others are less productive and do not build to the extent that the investor expected. This ''investment theory of creativity'' views creativity in a unique perspective compared to others, by asserting that creativity might rely to some extent on the right investment of effort being added to a field at the right time in the right way.&lt;ref&gt;(Sternberg &amp; Lubart, 1991, 1995, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Malevolent creativity ==
Malevolent creativity (MC) focuses on the "darker side" of creativity.&lt;ref name="The dark side of creativity"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McLaren | first1 = R. B. | year = 1993 | title = The dark side of creativity | url = | journal = Creat. Res. J. | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 137–144 | doi = 10.1080/10400419309534472 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of creativity is not typically accepted within society and is defined by the intention to cause harm to others through original and innovative means. MC should be distinguished from negative creativity in that negative creativity may unintentionally cause harm to others, whereas MC is explicitly malevolently motivated. MC is often a key contributor to crime and in its most destructive form can even manifest as terrorism. However, MC can also be observed in ordinary day-to-day life as lying, cheating and betrayal.&lt;ref name="Measure Malevolent Creativity 2016"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hao | first1 = N | last2 = Tang | first2 = M | last3 = Yang | first3 = J | last4 = Wang | first4 = Q | last5 = Runco | first5 = MA | year = 2016 | title = A New Tool to Measure Malevolent Creativity: The Malevolent Creativity Behavior Scale | url = | journal = Frontiers in Psychology | volume = 7 | issue = | page = 682 | doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00682 | pmid = 27242596 | pmc = 4870273 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although everyone shows some levels of MC under certain conditions, those that have a higher propensity towards malevolent creativity have increased tendencies to deceive and manipulate others to their own gain. Although levels of MC appear to dramatically increase when an individual is placed under unfair conditions, personality is also a key predictor in anticipating levels of malevolent thinking. Researches Harris and Reiter-Palmon investigated the role of aggression in levels of MC, in particular levels of implicit aggression and the tendency to employ aggressive actions in response to problem solving.  The personality traits of physical aggression, conscientiousness, emotional intelligence and implicit aggression all seem to be related with MC.&lt;ref name="The dark side of creativity"/&gt; Harris and Reiter-Palmon's research showed that when subjects were presented with a problem that triggered malevolent creativity, participants high in implicit aggression and low in premeditation expressed the largest number of malevolently-themed solutions. When presented with the more benign problem that triggered prosocial motives of helping others and cooperating, those high in implicit aggression, even if they were high in impulsiveness, were far less destructive in their imagined solutions. They concluded premeditation, more than implicit aggression controlled an individual’s expression of malevolent creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harris | first1 = D.

The current measure for malevolent creativity is the 13 item test Malevolent Creativity Behaviour Scale (MCBS) &lt;ref name="Measure Malevolent Creativity 2016"/&gt;

===Malevolent creativity and crime===
Malevolent creativity has strong links with crime. As creativity requires deviating from the conventional, there is a permanent tension between being creative and producing products that go too far and in some cases to the point of breaking the law. Aggression is a key predictor of malevolent creativity, and studies have also shown that increased levels of aggression also correlates to a higher likelihood of committing crime.&lt;ref&gt;Aggression: A social psychological analysis.

== Creativity across cultures ==
Creativity is viewed differently in different countries.&lt;ref&gt;Sternberg RJ 'Introduction' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (2006) (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' pp 1-9. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, cross-cultural research centred on [[Hong Kong]] found that Westerners view creativity more in terms of the individual attributes of a creative person, such as their aesthetic taste, while Chinese people view creativity more in terms of the social influence of creative people e.g. what they can contribute to society.&lt;ref&gt;Niu W (2006) 'Development of Creativity Research in Chinese Societies' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' pp 386-387. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mpofu et al. surveyed 28 African languages and found that 27 had no word which directly translated to 'creativity' (the exception being [[Arabic]]).&lt;ref&gt;Mpofu E et al (2006) 'African Perspectives on Creativity' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' p 465. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of [[linguistic relativity]], i.e. that language can affect thought, suggests that the lack of an equivalent word for 'creativity' may affect the views of creativity among speakers of such languages. However, more research would be needed to establish this, and there is certainly no suggestion that this linguistic difference makes people any less (or more) creative; [[Africa]] has a rich heritage of creative pursuits such as [[music]], [[art]], and [[storytelling]]. Nevertheless, it is true that there has been very little research on creativity in Africa,&lt;ref&gt;Mpofu E et al (2006) 'African Perspectives on Creativity' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' p 458. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there has also been very little research on creativity in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;Preiss DD and Strasser K (2006) 'Creativity in Latin America' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' p 46. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creativity has been more thoroughly researched in the northern hemisphere, but here again there are cultural differences, even between countries or groups of countries in close proximity. For example, in Scandinavian countries, creativity is seen as an individual attitude which helps in coping with life's challenges,&lt;ref&gt;Smith GJW and Carlsson I (2006) 'Creativity under the Northern Lights' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' p 202. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in Germany, creativity is seen more as a process that can be applied to help solve problems.&lt;ref&gt;Preiser S (2006) 'Creativity Research in German-Speaking Countries' in Kaufman JC and Sternberg RJ (eds) ''The International Handbook of Creativity'' p 175. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-54731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In organizations ==
[[File:Training meeting in a ecodesign stainless steel company in brazil.JPG|thumb|right|Training meeting in an eco-design stainless steel company in [[Brazil]]. The leaders among other things wish to cheer and encourage the workers in order to achieve a higher level of creativity.]]

It has been the topic of various research studies to establish that organizational effectiveness depends on the creativity of the workforce to a large extent. For any given organization, measures of effectiveness vary, depending upon its mission, environmental context, nature of work, the product or service it produces, and customer demands. Thus, the first step in evaluating organizational effectiveness is to understand the organization itself — how it functions, how it is structured, and what it emphasizes.

Amabile&lt;ref name="Amabile98"&gt;(Amabile, 1998; Sullivan and Harper, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; argued that to enhance creativity in business, three components were needed:
* Expertise (technical, procedural and intellectual knowledge),
* Creative thinking skills (how flexibly and imaginatively people approach problems),
* and Motivation (especially [[intrinsic motivation]]).

There are two types of motivation:
* [[Motivation|extrinsic motivation]] – [[Externality|external]] factors, for example [[threat]]s of being fired or money as a reward,
* [[intrinsic motivation]] – comes from inside an individual, satisfaction, enjoyment of work, etc.

Six managerial practices to encourage motivation are:
* Challenge – matching people with the right assignments;
* Freedom – giving people [[autonomy]] choosing means to achieve goals;
* [[Resource]]s – such as time, money, space, etc. There must be balance fit among resources and people;
* Work group features – [[Cultural diversity|diverse]], supportive teams, where members share the excitement, willingness to help, and recognize each other's talents;
* [[Supervisor]]y encouragement – recognitions, cheering, praising;
* Organizational support – value emphasis, information sharing, [[collaboration]].

Nonaka, who examined several successful Japanese companies, similarly saw creativity and knowledge creation as being important to the success of organizations.&lt;ref name="Nonaka91"&gt;(Nonaka, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, he emphasized the role that [[tacit knowledge]] has to play in the creative process.

In business, [[originality]] is not enough. The idea must also be appropriate—useful and [[Cause of action|actionable]].&lt;ref&gt;Amabile, T. M. (1998). "How to kill creativity". Harvard Business Review&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Siltala, R. 2010. Innovativity and cooperative learning in business life and teaching. University of Turku&lt;/ref&gt; [[Competitive intelligence|Creative competitive intelligence]] is a new solution to solve this problem. According to Reijo Siltala it links creativity to [[innovation]] process and [[competitive intelligence]] to creative workers.

Creativity can be encouraged in people and professionals and in the workplace. It is essential for innovation, and is a factor affecting economic growth and businesses. In 2013, the sociologist Silvia Leal Martín, using the Innova 3DX method, suggested measuring the various parameters that encourage creativity and innovation: corporate culture, work environment, leadership and management, creativity, self-esteem and optimism, locus of control and learning orientation, motivation, and fear.&lt;ref&gt;Leal, S. y Urrea J. "Ingenio y Pasión" (2013), Lid Publishers (Spanish) and Forbes India Magazine http://forbesindia.com/article/ie/new-trends-in-innovation-management/33905/1#ixzz2iiuuDxVq&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, social psychologists, organizational scientists, and management scientists who conduct extensive research on the factors that influence creativity and innovation in teams and organizations have developed integrative theoretical models that emphasize the roles of team composition, team processes, and organizational culture, as well as the mutually reinforcing relationships between them in promoting innovation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Woodman | first1 = R.

The investigation by Loo (2017) &lt;ref&gt;Loo, S. (2017) Creative Working in the Knowledge Economy. Abingdon, Oxfordshire: Routledge Ltd. {{ISBN|9781138211391}}; {{ISBN|9781315453095}}. https://www.routledge.com/Creative-Working-in-the-Knowledge-Economy/Loo/p/book/9781138211391&lt;/ref&gt; on creative working in the knowledge economy brings together studies of creativity as delineated in this web page. It offers connections with the sections on the ‘”Four C” model’, ‘Theories of creative processes’, ‘Creativity as a subset of intelligence’, ‘Creativity and personality’, and ‘In organisations’ It is the last section that the investigation addresses.

Research studies of the knowledge economy may be classified into three levels: macro, meso and micro. Macro studies refer to investigations at a societal or transnational dimension. Meso studies focus on organisations. Micro investigations centre on the minutiae workings of workers. There is also an interdisciplinary dimension such as research from businesses (e.g. Burton-Jones, 1999; Drucker, 1999), economics (e.g. Cortada, 1998; Reich, 2001; Florida, 2003), education (e.g. Farrell and Fenwick, 2007; Brown, Lauder and Ashton, 2011), human resource management (e.g. Davenport, 2005), knowledge and organizational management (Alvesson, 2004; Defillippi, Arthur and Lindsay, 2006; Orr, Nutley, Russell, Bain, Hacking and Moran, 2016), sociology, psychology, and knowledge economy-related sectors – especially information technology (IT) software (e.g. O’Riain, 2004; Nerland, 2008) and advertising (e.g. Grabher, 2004; Lury, 2004) (Loo, 2017).

Loo (2017) studies how individual workers in the knowledge economy use their creativity and know-how in the advertising and IT software sectors. It examines this phenomenon across three developed countries of England, Japan and Singapore to observe global perspectives. Specifically, the study uses qualitative data from semi-structured interviews of the related professionals in the roles of creative directing and copywriting (in advertising), and systems software developing and software programme managing.

The study offers a conceptual framework (Loo, 2017, p.&amp;nbsp;49) of a two-dimensional matrix of individual and collaborative working styles, and single and multi-contexts. The investigation draws on literature sources from the four disciplines of economics (e.g. Reich, 2001; Quah, 2002), management (e.g. ,Drucker, 1994; Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995; von Hippel, 2006), sociology (e.g. Zuboff, 1988; Bell, 1973; Lash and Urry, 1994; Castells, 2000; Knorr Cetina, 2005),  and psychology (e.g. Gardner, 1984; Csikszentmihalyi, 1988; Sternberg, Kaufman and Pretz, 2004). The themes arising from the analysis of knowledge work and creativity literature serve to create a distinct theoretical framework of creative knowledge work.  These workers apply their cognitive abilities, creative personalities and skill sets in the areas of science, technology, or culture industries to invent or discover new possibilities – e.g. a medium, product or service. These work activities may be done individually or collectively. Education, training and ‘encultured environments’ are necessary for the performance of these creative activities. Acts of creativity are viewed as asking new questions over and above those questions asked by an intelligent person, seeking novelty when reviewing a situation (Gardner, 1993), and creating something that is different and novel, i.e. a ‘variation’ on the idea of existing ideas in a domain (Csikszentmihalyi, 1988). This framework is evidenced by the empirical chapters on the micro-workings of creative workers in the two knowledge economy sectors from global perspectives.

This investigation identifies a definition of creative work, three types of work and the necessary conditions for it to occur. These workers use a combination of creative applications including anticipatory imagination, problem-solving, problem seeking, and generating ideas and aesthetic sensibilities. Taking aesthetic sensibilities as an example, for a creative director in the advertising industry, it is a visual imagery whether still or moving via a camera lens, and for a software programmer, it is the innovative technical expertise in which the software is written. There are specific creative applications for each of the sectors such as emotional connection in the advertising sector, and the power of expression and sensitivity in the IT software sector. In addition to the creative applications, creative workers require abilities and aptitudes to carry out their roles. Passion for one’s job is generic. For copywriters, this passion is identified with fun, enjoyment and happiness alongside attributes such as honesty (regarding the product), confidence, and patience in finding the appropriate copy. Knowledge is also required in the disciplines of the humanities (e.g. literature), the creative arts (e.g. painting and music) and technical-related know-how (e.g. mathematics, computer sciences and physical sciences). In the IT software, technical knowledge of computer languages (e.g. C++) is especially significant for programmers whereas the degree of technical expertise may be less for a programme manager, as only knowledge of the relevant language is necessary to understand the issues for communicating with the team of developers and testers.

There are three types of work. One is intra-sectoral (e.g. ‘general sponge’ and ’in tune with the zeitgeist’ [advertising], and ‘power of expression’ and ‘sensitivity’ [IT software]). The second is inter-sectoral (e.g. ‘integration of advertising activities’ [advertising], and ‘autonomous decentralized systems’ [ADS] [IT software]). The third relates to changes in culture/practices in the sectors (e.g. ‘three-dimensional trust’ and ‘green credentials’ [advertising], and ‘collaboration with HEIs and industry’ and ‘ADS system in the Tokyo train operator’ [IT software]).

The necessary conditions for creative work to exist are a supportive environment such as supportive information, communications and electronic technologies (ICET) infrastructure, training, work environment and education.

This investigation has implications for lifelong learning of these workers informally and formally. Teaching institutions need to offer multi-disciplinary knowledge of humanities, arts and sciences and it has impacts on the programme structure, delivery approaches and assessments. At a macro level, governments need to offer a rich diet of cultural activities, outdoor activities and sports fixtures that inform potential creative workers in the areas of video gaming and advertising. This study has implications for work organisations that support and encourage collaborative working alongside individual working, offer opportunities to engage in continuous professional development (formally and informally), and foster an environment, which promotes experiential functioning and supports experimentation.

'''[[Team Composition]]'''

Diversity between team members’ backgrounds and knowledge can increase team creativity by expanding the total collection of unique information that is available to the team and introducing different perspectives that can integrate in novel ways. However, under some conditions, diversity can also decrease team creativity by making it more difficult for team members to communicate about ideas and causing interpersonal conflicts between those with different perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harvey | first1 = S | year = 2013 | title = A different perspective: The multiple effects of deep level diversity on group creativity | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 49 | issue = 5| pages = 822–832 | doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2013.04.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the potential advantages of diversity must be supported by appropriate team processes and organizational cultures in order to enhance creativity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Paletz | first1 = S.

'''Team Processes'''

Team communication [[norm (social)|norm]]s, such as respecting others’ expertise, paying attention to others’ ideas, expecting information sharing, tolerating disagreements, [[negotiation|negotiating]], remaining open to others’ ideas, learning from others, and building on each other’s ideas, increase team creativity by facilitating the social processes involved with [[brainstorming]] and [[problem solving]]. Through these processes, team members are able to access their collective pool of knowledge, reach shared understandings, identify new ways of understanding problems or tasks, and make new connections between ideas. Engaging in these social processes also promotes positive team [[Affect (psychology)|affect]], which facilitates collective creativity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[Organizational culture|'''Organizational Culture''']]

Supportive and motivational environments that create [[psychological safety]] by encouraging risk taking and tolerating mistakes increase team creativity as well.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Organizations in which [[help-seeking]], [[Helping behavior|help giving]], and [[collaboration]] are rewarded promote innovation by providing opportunities and contexts in which team processes that lead to collective creativity can occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hargadon | first1 = A.

==Economic views of creativity==
Economic approaches to creativity have focussed on three aspects — the impact of creativity on economic growth, methods of modelling markets for creativity, and the maximisation of economic creativity (innovation).

In the early 20th century, [[Joseph Schumpeter]] introduced the economic theory of ''[[creative destruction]]'', to describe the way in which old ways of doing things are endogenously destroyed and replaced by the new. Some economists (such as [[Paul Romer]]) view creativity as an important element in the recombination of elements to produce new technologies and products and, consequently, economic growth. Creativity leads to [[capital (economics)|capital]], and creative products are protected by [[intellectual property]] laws.

[[Mark A. Runco]] and Daniel Rubenson have tried to describe a "[[Behavioral economics|psychoeconomic]]" model of creativity.&lt;ref name="RubRunc1992"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0732-118X(92)90021-Q|last=Rubenson|first=Daniel L.|author2=Runco, Mark |authorlink2=Mark A. Runco |title=The psychoeconomic approach to creativity|journal=New Ideas in Psychology|year=1992|volume=10|issue=2|pages=131–147}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such a model, creativity is the product of endowments and active investments in creativity; the costs and benefits of bringing creative activity to market determine the supply of creativity. Such an approach has been criticised for its view of creativity consumption as always having positive [[utility]], and for the way it analyses the value of future innovations.&lt;ref name="Diamond1992"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0732-118X(92)90023-S|last=Diamond|first=Arthur M.|title=Creativity and Interdisciplinarity: A Response to Rubenson and Runco|journal=New Ideas in Psychology|year=1992|volume=10|issue=2|pages=157–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[creative class]]'' is seen by some to be an important driver of modern economies. In his 2002 book, ''The Rise of the Creative Class'', [[economist]] [[Richard Florida]] popularized the notion that regions with "3 T's of economic development: Technology, Talent and Tolerance" also have high concentrations of [[creative professional]]s and tend to have a higher level of economic development.

==Fostering creativity==
{{Main|Creativity techniques}}

Several different researchers have proposed methods of increasing the creativity of an individual. Such ideas range from the [[Psychology|psychological]]-cognitive, such as [[Alex Faickney Osborn|Osborn]]-[[Sid Parnes|Parnes]] [[Creative_problem-solving|Creative Problem Solving Process]], [[Synectics]], science-based creative thinking, Purdue Creative Thinking Program, and [[Edward de Bono]]'s [[lateral thinking]]; to the highly structured, such as [[TRIZ]] (the Theory of Inventive Problem-Solving) and its variant Algorithm of Inventive Problem Solving (developed by the Russian scientist [[Genrich Altshuller]]), and Computer-Aided [[Morphological analysis (problem-solving)|morphological analysis]].

Daniel Pink, in his 2005 book ''A Whole New Mind'', repeating arguments posed throughout the 20th century, argues that we are entering a new age where creativity is becoming increasingly important. In this ''conceptual age'', we will need to foster and encourage ''right-directed thinking'' (representing creativity and emotion) over ''left-directed thinking'' (representing logical, analytical thought). However, this simplification of 'right' versus 'left' brain thinking is not supported by the research data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/lives-the-brain/201004/creativity-the-brain-and-evolution|title=Creativity, the Brain, and Evolution|website=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Stimulating and rewarding curiosity and exploration
# Building motivation, especially internal motivation
# Encouraging confidence and a willingness to take risks
# Focusing on mastery and self-competition
# Promoting supportable beliefs about creativity
# Providing opportunities for choice and discovery
# Developing self-management (metacognitive skills)
# Teaching techniques and strategies for facilitating creative performance

==Creativity and education policies==

Some see the conventional system of [[education|schooling]] as "stifling" of creativity and attempt (particularly in the [[preschool]]/[[kindergarten]] and early school years) to provide a creativity-friendly, rich, imagination-fostering environment for young children.&lt;ref name=Nickerson99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name="Csik99handbook"&gt;{{cite book|last=Csíkszentmihályi|first=Mihály|title=Handbook of Creativity|year=1999|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|editor=R.

M.|title=Why creativity now?|journal=Educational Leadership|year=2009|volume=67|issue=1|pages=22–26|authorlink=Ken Robinson (British author)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have seen this as important because technology is advancing our society at an unprecedented rate and creative problem solving will be needed to cope with these challenges as they arise.&lt;ref name=RobAzzam2009 /&gt; In addition to helping with problem solving, creativity also helps students identify problems where others have failed to do so.&lt;ref name=Nickerson99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name= Csik99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paris, C., Edwards, N., Sheffield, E., Mutinsky, M., Olexa, T., Reilly, S., &amp; Baer, J. (2006). How early school experiences impact creativity. In J. C. Kaufman &amp; J. Baer (Eds.), Creativity and Reason in Cognitive Development (pp. 333–350). New York, NY: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; See the Waldorf School as an example of an education program that promotes creative thought.

Promoting intrinsic motivation and problem solving are two areas where educators can foster creativity in students. Students are more creative when they see a task as intrinsically motivating, valued for its own sake.&lt;ref name=Csik99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name=RobAzzam2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name="ByrgeHanson2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Byrge|first=C.|author2=Hanson.

(1993). Evolution and flow. In M. Csikszentmihalyi (Ed.), The evolving self: A psychology for the third millennium (pp. 175–206). New York: Harper Perennial.&lt;/ref&gt; To promote creative thinking, educators need to identify what motivates their students and structure teaching around it. Providing students with a choice of activities to complete allows them to become more intrinsically motivated and therefore creative in completing the tasks.&lt;ref name=Nickerson99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Advisory Committee on Creative and Cultural Education (1998). All our futures: Creativity, culture, and education. UK: NACCCE&lt;/ref&gt;

Teaching students to solve problems that do not have well defined answers is another way to foster their creativity. This is accomplished by allowing students to explore problems and redefine them, possibly drawing on knowledge that at first may seem unrelated to the problem in order to solve it.&lt;ref name=Nickerson99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name=Csik99handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name= RobAzzam2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ByrgeHanson2009 /&gt; In adults, mentoring individuals is another way to foster their creativiy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The manifesto : a guide to developing a creative career|last=Torrance|first=E.

===Scotland===
In the [[Education in Scotland|Scottish education system]], creativity is identified as a core skillset for learning, life and work and is defined as “a process which generates ideas that have value to the individual.  It involves looking at familiar things with a fresh eye, examining problems with an open mind, making connections, learning from mistakes and using imagination to explore new possibilities.” [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/practice-exemplars/Creativity%203-18%20curriculum%20review%20(impact%20report)] The need to develop a shared language and understanding of creativity and its role across every aspect of learning, teaching and continuous improvement was identified as a necessary aim [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/learning-resources/Creative%20Learning%20Networks] and a set of four skills is used to allow educators to discuss and develop creativity skills across all subjects and sectors of education – curiosity, open—mindedness, imagination and problem solving. [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/learning-resources/What%20are%20creativity%20skills?] Distinctions are made between creative learning (when learners are using their creativity skills), creative teaching (when educators are using their creativity skills) and creative change (when creativity skills are applied to planning and improvement). [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/documents/creativity/cre24_infographics/cre24-the-big-picture.pdf] Scotland’s national Creative Learning Plan [http://www.creativescotland.com/resources/our-publications/plans-and-strategy-documents/scotlands-creative-learning-plan-2013] supports the development of creativity skills in all learners and of educators’ expertise in developing creativity skills. A range of resources have been created to support and assess this [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/Pages/Search.aspx?k=Creativity%20infographics] including a national review of creativity across learning by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate for Education. [https://education.gov.scot/improvement/practice-exemplars/Creativity%203-18%20curriculum%20review%20(impact%20report)]

===United States===
Creativity has also been identified as one of the key [[21st century skills]] and as one of the  [[Four Cs of 21st century learning]] by educational leaders and theorists in the United States.

==History==
The earliest documentation of critical thinking are the teachings of [[Socrates]] recorded by Plato. Socrates established the fact that one cannot depend upon those in "authority" to have sound knowledge and insight. He demonstrated that persons may have power and high position and yet be deeply confused and irrational. He established the importance of asking deep questions that probe profoundly into thinking before we accept ideas as worthy of belief.

He established the importance of seeking evidence, closely examining reasoning and assumptions, analyzing basic concepts, and tracing out implications not only of what is said but of what is done as well. His method of questioning is now known as "Socratic Questioning" and is the best known critical thinking teaching strategy. In his mode of questioning, Socrates highlighted the need for thinking for clarity and logical consistency. Socrates asked people questions to reveal their irrational thinking or lack of reliable knowledge. Socrates demonstrated that having authority does not ensure accurate knowledge. He established the method of questioning beliefs, closely inspecting assumptions and relying on evidence and sound rationale. Plato recorded Socrates' teachings and carried on the tradition of critical thinking. Aristotle and subsequent Greek skeptics refined Socrates' teachings, using systematic thinking and asking questions to ascertain the true nature of reality beyond the way things appear from a glance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.criticalthinking.org/pages/a-brief-history-of-the-idea-of-critical-thinking/408|title=A Brief History of the Idea of Critical Thinking|website=www.criticalthinking.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Socrates set the agenda for the tradition of critical thinking, namely, to reflectively question common beliefs and explanations, carefully distinguishing beliefs that are reasonable and logical from those that—however appealing to our native egocentrism, however much they serve our vested interests, however comfortable or comforting they may be—lack adequate evidence or rational foundation to warrant belief.

Critical thinking was described by Richard W. Paul as a movement in two waves (1994).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Re-Thinking Reason|last=Walters|first=Kerry|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=1994|isbn=|location=Albany|pages=181–98|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "first wave" of critical thinking is often referred to as 
a 'critical analysis' that is clear, [[rationality|rational]] thinking involving [[critique]]. Its details vary amongst those who [[operational definition|define]] it. According to Barry K. Beyer (1995), critical thinking means making clear, reasoned judgments. During the process of critical thinking, ideas should be reasoned, well thought out, and judged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://myweb.wvnet.edu/~jelkins/critproj/overview.html|title = The Critical Thinking Movement: Alternating Currents in One Teacher's Thinking|first=James R. | last=Elkins|accessdate = 23 March 2014 |website =myweb.wvnet.edu |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. National Council for Excellence in Critical Thinking&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.criticalthinking.org//|title=Critical Thinking Index Page|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines critical thinking as the "&lt;nowiki&gt;intellectually disciplined process of actively and skillfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing, synthesizing, or evaluating information gathered from, or generated by, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or communication, as a guide to belief and action.&lt;/nowiki&gt;"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.criticalthinking.org/pages/defining-critical-thinking/766|title=Defining Critical Thinking|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Critical Thinking Skills Diagram.jpg|thumb|

]]
In the term '''critical thinking''', the word ''[[wikt:critical|critical]]'', (Grk. κριτικός = ''kritikos'' = "critic") derives from the word '''critic''' and implies a [[critique]]; it identifies the intellectual capacity and the means "of judging", "of judgement", "for judging", and of being "able to discern".&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Lesley. (ed.) ''The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary'' (1993) p. 551.&lt;/ref&gt; The intellectual roots of critical&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dictionary.com/e/critical-thinking/|title=Lexical Investigations: Critical Thinking - Everything After Z by Dictionary.com|date=2013-06-25|work=Everything After Z by Dictionary.com|access-date=2018-04-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; thinking are as [[Ancient history|''ancient'']] as its etymology, traceable, ultimately, to the [[Teachings and philosophy of Swami Vivekananda|teaching]] practice and vision of '''''[[Socrates]]'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/socrates-9488126|title=Socrates|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2,500 years ago who discovered by a method of probing questioning that people could not rationally justify their confident claims to [[Knowledge|knowledge.]]

==Definitions==
Traditionally, critical thinking has been variously defined as follows:

* Thinking about one's thinking in a manner designed to organize and clarify, raise the efficiency of, and recognize errors and biases in one's own thinking. Critical thinking is not 'hard' thinking nor is it directed at solving problems (other than 'improving' one's own thinking). Critical thinking is inward-directed with the intent of maximizing the [[rationality]] of the thinker. One does not use critical thinking to solve problems—one uses critical thinking to improve one's process of thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Carmichael, Kirby; letter to Olivetti, Laguna Salada Union School District, May 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "An appraisal based on careful analytical evaluation"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/critical+analysis|title=critical analysis|newspaper=TheFreeDictionary.com|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary critical thinking scholars have expanded these traditional definitions to include qualities, concepts, and processes such as creativity, imagination, discovery, reflection, empathy, connecting knowing, feminist theory, subjectivity, ambiguity, and inconclusiveness.  Some definitions of critical thinking exclude these subjective practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Re-Thinking Reason|last=Walters|first=Kerry|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=1994|isbn=|location=Albany|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logic and rationality==
{{main article|Logic and rationality}}
{{refimprove section|date=November 2016|reason=need to follow standard wikipedia reference style}}
The ability to reason logically is a fundamental skill of rational agents, hence the study of the form of correct argumentation is relevant to the study of critical thinking.

"First wave" logical [[thinking]] consisted of understanding the connections between two concepts or points in thought. It followed a philosophy where the [[Thought|thinker]] was removed from the train of thought and the connections and the analysis of the connect was devoid of any bias of the thinker. Kerry Walters describes this ideology in his essay Beyond Logicism in Critical Thinking, "A logistic approach to critical thinking conveys the message to students that thinking is legitimate only when it conforms to the procedures of informal (and, to a lesser extent, formal) logic and that the good thinker necessarily aims for styles of examination and appraisal that are analytical, abstract, universal, and objective. This model of [[thinking]] has become so entrenched in conventional academic wisdom that many educators accept it as canon".&lt;ref name="Walters1994"/&gt; The adoption of these principals parallels themselves with the increasing reliance on a quantitative understanding of the world.

In the ‘second wave’ of critical thinking, as defined by [[Kerry S. Walters]] (Re-thinking Reason, 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;1), many authors moved away from the logocentric mode of critical thinking that the ‘first wave’ privileged, especially in institutions of higher [[learning]]. Walters summarizes logicism as "the unwarranted assumption that good thinking is reducible to logical thinking".&lt;ref name="Walters1994"/&gt;

"A logistic approach to critical thinking conveys the message to students that thinking is legitimate only when it conforms to the procedures of informal (and, to a lesser extent, formal) logic and that the good thinker necessarily aims for styles of examination and appraisal that are analytical, abstract, universal, and objective."&lt;ref name="Walters1994"/&gt;
As the ‘second wave’ took hold, scholars began to take a more inclusive view of what constituted as critical thinking. Rationality and logic are still widely accepted in many circles as the primary examples of critical thinking.

===Deduction, abduction and induction===
{{main|logical reasoning}}
There are three types of [[logical reasoning]] Informally, two kinds of logical reasoning can be distinguished in addition to formal [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]]: [[inductive reasoning|induction]] and [[abductive reasoning|abduction]].
* [[Deductive reasoning|Deduction]] is the conclusion of a consequence given premises that logically follow by [[modus ponens]].
  e.g., X is human and all humans have a face so X has a face.
* [[Inductive reasoning|Induction]] is drawing a conclusion from a pattern that is guaranteed by the strictness of the structure to which it applies.
  e.g., The sum of even integers is even.
  2x+2y = 2(x+y); The sum of integers is an integer and x and y are integers, so 2x+2y=2z where z is an integer, thus 2z is an even integer, so the sum of even integers is even.
* [[Abductive reasoning|Abduction]] is drawing a conclusion using a [[heuristic]] that is likely, but not inevitable given some foreknowledge.
  e.g., I observe sheep in a field, and they appear white from my viewing angle, so sheep are white.
       Contrast with the deductive statement:"Some sheep are white on at least one side."
&lt;!--Start copypasta--&gt;

===Critical thinking and rationality===
Kerry S. Walters (Re-thinking Reason, 1994) argues that rationality demands more than just logical or traditional methods of problem solving and analysis or what he calls the "calculus of justification" but also considers "[[cognitive]] acts such as [[imagination]], conceptual creativity, [[intuition]] and insight" (p.&amp;nbsp;63). These "functions" are focused on discovery, on more abstract processes instead of linear, rules-based approaches to problem-solving. The linear and non-sequential mind must both be engaged in the [[rational]] [[mind]].&lt;ref name="Walters1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kerry S. Walters|title=Re-Thinking Reason: New Perspectives in Critical Thinking|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TfT32n2Hvd0C|year=1994|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-2095-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability to critically analyze an argument – to dissect structure and components, thesis and reasons – is essential. But so is the ability to be flexible and consider non-traditional alternatives and perspectives. These complementary functions are what allow for critical thinking to be a practice encompassing imagination and intuition in cooperation with traditional modes of deductive inquiry.&lt;ref name="Walters1994"/&gt;

==Functions==
The list of core critical thinking skills includes observation, interpretation, analysis, inference, evaluation, explanation, and [[metacognition]]. According to Reynolds (2011), an individual or group engaged in a strong way of critical thinking gives due consideration to establish for instance:&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Martin (2011). Critical thinking and systems thinking: towards a critical literacy for systems thinking in practice. In: Horvath, Christopher P. and Forte, James M. eds. Critical Thinking. New York: Nova Science Publishers, pp. 37–68.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Evidence through reality
* Context skills to isolate the problem from context
* Relevant criteria for making the judgment well
* Applicable methods or techniques for forming the judgment
* Applicable theoretical constructs for understanding the problem and the question at hand

In addition to possessing strong critical-thinking skills, one must be disposed to engage problems and decisions using those skills. Critical thinking employs not only [[logic]] but broad [[intellect]]ual criteria such as clarity, [[credibility]], [[accuracy]], precision, [[relevance]], depth, [[breadth]], significance, and fairness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first= Elizabeth A., &amp; And Others |year=1995|title= National Assessment of College Student Learning: Identifying College Graduates' Essential Skills in Writing, Speech and Listening, and Critical Thinking.

==Procedure==
Critical thinking calls for the ability to:
* Recognize problems, to find workable means for meeting those problems
* Understand the importance of prioritization and order of precedence in problem solving
* Gather and marshal pertinent (relevant) information
* Recognize [[unstated assumption]]s and values
* Comprehend and use [[language]] with accuracy, clarity, and [[wikt:discernment|discernment]]
* Interpret data, to appraise evidence and evaluate arguments
* Recognize the existence (or non-existence) of logical relationships between propositions
* Draw warranted conclusions and generalizations
* Put to test the conclusions and generalizations at which one arrives
* Reconstruct one's patterns of beliefs on the basis of wider experience
* Render accurate judgments about specific things and qualities in everyday life

In sum:

"A persistent effort to examine any belief or supposed form of knowledge in the light of the evidence that supports or refutes it and the further conclusions to which it tends."&lt;ref name=glaser&gt;{{Cite book| title=An Experiment in the Development of Critical Thinking| edition=| author=Edward M. Glaser| year=1941| publisher=New York, Bureau of Publications, Teachers College, Columbia University| isbn=0-404-55843-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habits or traits of mind==
The habits of [[mind]] that characterize a person strongly disposed toward critical thinking include a desire to follow reason and evidence wherever they may lead, a systematic approach to problem solving, [[inquisitiveness]], even-handedness, and confidence in [[reasoning]].&lt;ref&gt;The National Assessment of College Student Learning: Identification of the Skills to be Taught, Learned, and Assessed, NCES 94–286, US Dept of Education, Addison Greenwood (Ed), Sal Carrallo (PI). See also, Critical thinking: A statement of expert consensus for purposes of educational assessment and instruction. ERIC Document No. ED 315–423&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a definition analysis by Kompf &amp; Bond (2001), critical thinking involves problem solving, decision making, [[metacognition]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://serc.carleton.edu/NAGTWorkshops/metacognition/teaching_metacognition.html|title=Teaching Metacognition|website=Metacognition|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; rationality, rational thinking, [[reasoning]], [[knowledge]], [[intelligence]] and also a moral component such as reflective thinking. Critical thinkers therefore need to have reached a level of maturity in their development, possess a certain attitude as well as a set of taught skills.

==Research==
Edward M. Glaser proposed that the ability to think critically involves three elements:&lt;ref name=glaser/&gt;

#An attitude of being disposed to consider in a thoughtful way the problems and subjects that come within the range of one's experiences
#Knowledge of the methods of logical [[inquiry]] and reasoning
#Some skill in applying those methods.
Educational programs aimed at developing critical thinking in children and adult learners, individually or in group problem solving and decision making contexts, continue to address these same three central elements.

The Critical Thinking project at Human Science Lab, [[London]], is involved in scientific study of all major [[educational system]] in prevalence today to assess how the systems are working to promote or impede critical thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://humansciencelab.org.uk/research/| title=Research at Human Science Lab |publisher=Human Science Lab | access-date=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary cognitive psychology regards human reasoning as a complex process that is both reactive and reflective.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, S.A. (2002) "Two Systems of Reasoning," in ''Heuristics and Biases: The Psychology of Intuitive Judgment'', Govitch, Griffin, Kahneman (Eds), Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-79679-8}}; ''Thinking and Reasoning in Human Decision Making: The Method of Argument and Heuristic Analysis'', Facione and Facione, 2007, California Academic Press.  {{ISBN|978-1-891557-58-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between critical thinking skills and critical thinking dispositions is an empirical question. Some people have both in abundance, some have skills but not the disposition to use them, some are disposed but lack strong skills, and some have neither. A measure of critical thinking dispositions is the California Measure of Mental Motivation&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OT12dZ0binIC&amp;pg=PA46 ''Research on Sociocultural Influences on Motivation and Learning''], p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; and the California Critical Thinking Dispositions Inventory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walsh|first=Catherine, M.|date=2007|title=California Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory: Further Factor Analytic Examination|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.2466/pms.104.1.141-151|journal=SAGE|volume=104|pages=141–151|via=SAGE|doi=10.2466/pms.104.1.141-151}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CriTT is an alternative measure that examines student beliefs and attitudes about critical thinking&lt;ref&gt;Stupple, E.

Development of the Critical Thinking Toolkit (CriTT): A measure of student attitudes and beliefs about critical thinking. Thinking Skills and Creativity, 23, 91-100.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
[[John Dewey]] is one of many educational leaders who recognized that a curriculum aimed at building thinking skills would benefit the individual learner, the community, and the entire democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, John. (1910). ''How we think.'' Lexington, MA: D.C. Heath &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical thinking is significant in academics due to being significant in learning. Critical thinking is significant in the learning process of [[internalization]], in the construction of basic ideas, principles, and theories inherent in content.  And critical thinking is significant in the learning process of application, whereby those ideas, principles, and theories are implemented effectively as they become relevant in learners' lives.

Each discipline adapts its use of critical thinking concepts and principles. The core concepts are always there, but they are embedded in subject-specific content. For students to learn content, intellectual engagement is crucial. All students must do their own thinking, their own construction of knowledge. Good teachers recognize this and therefore focus on the questions, readings, activities that stimulate the mind to take ownership of key concepts and principles underlying the subject.

Historically, teaching of critical thinking focused only on logical procedures such as formal and informal logic. This emphasized to students that good thinking is equivalent to logical thinking. However, a second wave of critical thinking, urges educators to value conventional techniques, meanwhile expanding what it means to be a critical thinker. In 1994, Kerry Walters&lt;ref&gt;Walters, Kerry. (1994). ''Re-Thinking Reason''. Albany, NY: State University of New York Press.&lt;/ref&gt; compiled a conglomeration of sources surpassing this logical restriction to include many different authors’ research regarding connected knowing, empathy, gender-sensitive ideals, collaboration, world views, intellectual autonomy, morality and enlightenment. These concepts invite students to incorporate their own perspectives and experiences into their thinking.

In the English and Welsh school systems, ''Critical Thinking'' is offered as a subject that 16- to 18-year-olds can take as an [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-Level]]. Under the [[OCR (exam board)|OCR]] [[exam board]], students can sit two exam papers for the AS: "Credibility of Evidence" and "Assessing and Developing Argument". The full Advanced [[General Certificate of Education|GCE]] is now available: in addition to the two AS units, candidates sit the two papers "Resolution of Dilemmas" and "Critical Reasoning". The A-level tests candidates on their ability to think critically about, and analyze, arguments on their deductive or inductive validity, as well as producing their own arguments. It also tests their ability to analyze certain related topics such as credibility and ethical decision-making. However, due to its comparative lack of subject content, many universities do not accept it as a main A-level for admissions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ocr.org.uk/qualifications/asa_levelgceforfirstteachingin2008/critical_thinking/faqs.html Critical Thinking FAQs from Oxford Cambridge and RSA Examinations] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411150135/http://www.ocr.org.uk/qualifications/asa_levelgceforfirstteachingin2008/critical_thinking/faqs.html |date=11 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the AS is often useful in developing reasoning skills, and the full Advanced [[General Certificate of Education|GCE]] is useful for degree courses in politics, philosophy, history or [[theology]], providing the skills required for critical analysis that are useful, for example, in biblical study.

There used to also be an [[Advanced Extension Award]] offered in Critical Thinking in the UK, open to any A-level student regardless of whether they have the Critical Thinking A-level. [[Cambridge International Examinations]] have an A-level in Thinking Skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cie.org.uk/qualifications/academic/uppersec/alevel/subject/aleveldetails?assdef_id=765_804|title=Cambridge International AS and A Level subjects|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2008, [[Assessment and Qualifications Alliance]] has also been offering an A-level Critical Thinking specification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aqa.org.uk/qual/gce/critical_thinking_new.php "New GCEs for 2008"], Assessment and Qualifications Alliance {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217221100/http://www.aqa.org.uk/qual/gce/critical_thinking_new.php |date=17 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[OCR (exam board)|OCR]] [[exam board]] have also modified theirs for 2008. Many examinations for university entrance set by universities, on top of A-level examinations, also include a critical thinking component, such as the [[LNAT]], the [[UKCAT]], the [[BioMedical Admissions Test]] and the [[Thinking Skills Assessment]].

In [[Qatar]], critical thinking was offered by [[AL-Bairaq]]—an outreach, non-traditional educational program that targets high school students and focuses on a curriculum based on [[STEM fields]]. The idea behind [[AL-Bairaq]] is to offer high school students the opportunity to connect with the research environment in the Center for Advanced Materials (CAM) at Qatar University. Faculty members train and mentor the students and help develop and enhance their critical thinking, problem-solving, and teamwork skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qu.edu.qa/offices/research/CAM/dmsprogram/index.php |accessdate=5 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419220638/http://www.qu.edu.qa/offices/research/CAM/dmsprogram/index.php |title=

===Efficacy===
In 1995, a meta-analysis of the literature on teaching effectiveness in higher [[education]] was undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;Lion Gardiner, Redesigning Higher Education: Producing Dramatic Gains in Student Learning, in conjunction with: ERIC Clearinghouse on Higher Education, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;
The study noted concerns from higher [[education]], [[politician]]s, and [[business]] that higher education was failing to meet society's requirements for well-educated citizens.  It concluded that although faculty may aspire to develop students' [[thinking]] skills, in practice they have tended to aim at facts and concepts utilizing lowest levels of [[cognition]], rather than developing intellect or [[values]].

In a more recent meta-analysis, researchers reviewed 341 quasi- or true-experimental studies, all of which used some form of standardized critical thinking measure to assess the outcome variable.&lt;ref name="Abrami, P. C. 2014"&gt;Abrami, P. C., Bernard, R. M., Borokhovski, E., Waddington, D. I., Wade, C. A., &amp; Persson, T. (2014). Strategies for Teaching Students to Think Critically: A Meta-Analysis. Review of Educational Research, 1–40&lt;/ref&gt; The authors describe the various methodological approaches and attempt to categorize the differing assessment tools, which include standardized tests (and second-source measures), tests developed by teachers, tests developed by researchers, and tests developed by teachers who also serve the role as the [[researcher]].  The results emphasized the need for exposing students to real-world problems and the importance in encouraging open dialogue within a supportive environment.  Effective strategies for teaching critical thinking are thought to be possible in a wide variety of [[educational]] settings.&lt;ref name="Abrami, P. C. 2014"/&gt; One attempt to assess the [[humanities]]' role in teaching critical thinking and reducing belief in [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] claims was made at [[North Carolina State University]]. Some success was noted and the researchers emphasized the value of the humanities in providing the skills to evaluate current events and qualitative data in context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frazier |first1=Kendrick |authorlink1=Kendrick Frazier |title=Humanities, Too: In New Study, History Courses in Critical Thinking Reduce Pseudoscientific Beliefs |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2017 |volume=41 |issue=4 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Scott Lilienfeld]] notes that there is some evidence to suggest that basic critical thinking skills might be successfully taught to children at a younger age than previously thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lilienfeld |first1=Scott |authorlink1=Scott Lilienfeld |title=Teaching Skepticism: How Early Can We Begin? |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2017 |volume=41 |issue=5 |pages=30-31 |url=https://www.csicop.org/si/show/teaching_skepticism_how_early_can_we_begin |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180810182835/https://www.csicop.org/si/show/teaching_skepticism_how_early_can_we_begin |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2018-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance in academia==
Critical thinking is an important element of all professional fields and academic disciplines (by referencing their respective sets of permissible questions, evidence sources, criteria, etc.). Within the framework of [[scientific skepticism]], the process of critical thinking involves the careful acquisition and interpretation of information and use of it to reach a [[theory of justification|well-justified]] conclusion. The concepts and principles of critical thinking can be applied to any context or case but only by reflecting upon the nature of that application. Critical thinking forms, therefore, a system of related, and overlapping, modes of thought such as anthropological thinking, sociological thinking, historical thinking, political thinking, [[psychological]] thinking, philosophical thinking, mathematical thinking, chemical thinking, biological thinking, ecological thinking, legal thinking, ethical thinking, musical thinking, thinking like a painter, sculptor, engineer, business person, etc. In other words, though critical thinking principles are universal, their application to disciplines requires a process of reflective [[contextualism|contextualization]].

Critical thinking is considered important in the academic fields because it enables one to analyze, evaluate, explain, and restructure their thinking, thereby decreasing the risk of adopting, acting on, or thinking with, a false belief. However, even with knowledge of the methods of logical inquiry and reasoning, mistakes can happen due to a thinker's inability to apply the methods or because of character traits such as [[egocentrism]]. Critical thinking includes identification of [[prejudice]], [[bias]], propaganda, self-deception, distortion, [[misinformation]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://philosophy.hku.hk/think/fallacy/biases.php |title=[F08] Cognitive biases |last1=Lau |first1=Joe |last2=Chan |first2=Jonathan |date= |website=Critical thinking web |publisher= |access-date=2016-02-01 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given research in [[cognitive psychology]], some [[education|educators]] believe that schools should focus on teaching their students critical thinking [[skill]]s and cultivation of intellectual traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.criticalthinking.org/pages/critical-thinking-moral-integrity-and-citizenship-teaching-for-the-intellectual-virtues/487 |title=Critical Thinking, Moral Integrity and Citizenship |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=Criticalthinking.org |publisher= |access-date=2016-02-01 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical thinking skills can be used to help nurses during the assessment process. Through the use of critical thinking, nurses can question, evaluate, and reconstruct the nursing care process by challenging the established theory and practice. Critical thinking skills can help nurses problem solve, reflect, and make a conclusive decision about the current situation they face. Critical thinking creates "new possibilities for the development of the nursing knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;Catching the wave: understanding the concept of critical thinking (1999) {{DOI|10.1046/j.1365-2648.1999.00925.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the sociocultural, environmental, and political issues that are affecting healthcare delivery, it would be helpful to embody new techniques in nursing. Nurses can also engage their critical thinking skills through the Socratic method of dialogue and reflection. This practice standard is even part of some regulatory organizations such as the College of Nurses of Ontario – Professional Standards for Continuing Competencies (2006).&lt;ref&gt;College of Nurses of Ontario – Professional Standards for 
[http://www.cno.org/Global/4-LearnAboutStandardsAndGuidelines/prac/learn/modules/profstands/slides/Competence.pdf Continuing Competencies (2006)]&lt;/ref&gt;
It requires nurses to engage in [[Reflective Practice]] and keep records of this continued professional development for possible review by the College.

Critical thinking is also considered important for [[human rights education]] for [[toleration]]. The [[International Day for Tolerance|Declaration of Principles on Tolerance]] adopted by [[UNESCO]] in 1995 affirms that "education for tolerance could aim at countering factors that lead to fear and exclusion of others, and could help young people to develop capacities for independent judgement, ''critical thinking'' and ethical [[reasoning]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=UNESCO |title=International Day for Tolerance . Declaration of Principles on Tolerance, Article 4, 3 |url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13175&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical thinking is used as a way of deciding whether a claim is true, partially true, or false. It is a tool by which one can come about reasoned conclusions based on a reasoned process.

==In computer-mediated communication==
The advent and rising popularity of online courses has prompted some to ask if computer-mediated communication (CMC) promotes, hinders, or has no effect on the amount and quality of critical thinking in a course (relative to face-to-face communication). There is some evidence to suggest a fourth, more nuanced possibility: that CMC may promote some aspects of critical thinking but hinder others. For example, Guiller et al. (2008)&lt;ref name="Guiller2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guiller|first1=Jane|last2=Durndell|first2=Alan|last3=Ross|first3=Anne|title=Peer interaction and critical thinking: Face-to-face or online discussion?|journal=Learning and Instruction|date=2008|volume=18|pages=187–200|doi=10.1016/j.learninstruc.2007.03.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that, relative to face-to-face discourse, online discourse featured more justifications, while face-to-face discourse featured more instances of students expanding on what others had said. The increase in justifications may be due to the asynchronous nature of online discussions, while the increase in expanding comments may be due to the spontaneity of ‘real time’ discussion. Newman et al. (1995)&lt;ref name="Newman1995"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Newman|first1=D R|last2=Webb|first2=Brian|last3=Cochrane|first3=Clive|title=A content analysis method to measure critical thinking in face-to-face and computer supported group learning|journal=Interpersonal Computing and Technology|date=1995|volume=3|issue=September 1993|pages=56–77|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2648.2007.04569.x|pmid=18352969}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed similar differential effects. They found that while CMC boasted more important statements and linking of ideas, it lacked novelty. The authors suggest that this may be due to difficulties participating in a brainstorming-style activity in an asynchronous environment. Rather, the asynchrony may promote users to put forth “considered, thought out contributions.”

Researchers assessing critical thinking in online discussion forums often employ a technique called Content Analysis,&lt;ref name="Newman1995" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guiller2008" /&gt; where the text of online discourse (or the transcription of face-to-face discourse) is systematically coded for different kinds of statements relating to critical thinking. For example, a statement might be coded as “Discuss ambiguities to clear them up” or “Welcoming outside knowledge” as positive indicators of critical thinking. Conversely, statements reflecting poor critical thinking may be labeled as “Sticking to prejudice or assumptions” or “Squashing attempts to bring in outside knowledge.” The frequency of these codes in CMC and face-to-face discourse can be compared to draw conclusions about the quality of critical thinking.

Searching for evidence of critical thinking in discourse has roots in a definition of critical thinking put forth by Kuhn (1991),&lt;ref name="Kuhn1991"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kuhn|first1=D|title=The skills of argument|date=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; which emphasizes the social nature of discussion and knowledge construction. There is limited research on the role of social experience in critical thinking development, but there is some evidence to suggest it is an important factor. For example, research has shown that 3- to 4-year-old children can discern, to some extent, the differential creditability&lt;ref name="Koenig2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koenig|first1=M A|last2=Harris|first2=P L|title=Preschoolers mistrust ignorant and inaccurate speakers|journal=Child Development|date=2005|volume=76|pages=1261–77|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2005.00849.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and expertise&lt;ref name="Lutz2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lutz|first1=D J|last2=Keil|first2=F C|title=Early understanding of the division of cognitive labor|journal=Child Development|date=2002|volume=73|pages=1073–84|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00458}}&lt;/ref&gt; of individuals. Further evidence for the impact of social experience on the development of critical thinking skills comes from work that found that 6- to 7-year-olds from China have similar levels of skepticism to 10- and 11-year-olds in the United States.&lt;ref name="Heyman2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heyman|first1=G D|last2=Fu|first2=G|last3=Lee|first3=K|title=Evaluating claims peoplemake about themselves: The development of skepticism|journal=Child Development|date=2007|volume=78|pages=367–75|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2007.01003.x|pmc=2570105}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the development of critical thinking skills was solely due to maturation, it is unlikely we would see such dramatic differences across cultures.

'''Cultural-historical activity theory''' ('''CHAT''')&lt;ref&gt;Or [[activity theory]] (AT), as it is also known. {{harvnb|Kaptelinin|Nardi|2006|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a theoretical framework&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nardi|1996|page=7}} notes that activity theory is a "''a research framework and set of perspectives''", not a hard and fast methodology or strongly predictive single theory.&lt;/ref&gt; which helps to understand and analyse the relationship between the human mind (what people think and feel) and activity (what people do).&lt;ref name="Daniels10"&gt;{{harvnb|Daniels|et al.|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KaptNard6"&gt;{{harvnb|Kaptelinin|Nardi|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roth|Lee|2007|page=192}}: ''"CHAT was conceived of as a concrete psychology immersed in everyday [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/praxis praxis]"'': "''consciousness is located in everyday practice: you are what you do''" {{harvnb|Nardi|1996|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It traces its origins to the founders&lt;ref&gt;In the 1920s till the mid 1930s.&lt;/ref&gt; of the cultural-historical school of Russian psychology [[L. S. Vygotsky]]&lt;ref name="bioBook"&gt;Yasnitsky, A. (2018). [https://www.routledge.com/Vygotsky-An-Intellectual-Biography/Yasnitsky/p/book/9781138806740 Vygotsky: An Intellectual Biography].

Lektorsky in {{harvnb|Engeström|Miettinen|Punamäki|1999|p=66}};[http://resources.iupsys.net/iupsys/index.php/iupsysresources/565-iupsys-bib-2000/43662-the-activity-approach-and-psychology-2004-  Brushlinskii, A.

Engeström would be happy to also include [in the account of A.T.] reference to Luria, Zinchenko (father, Peter, and son, Vladimir), Elkonin, Davydov, Brushlinsky and Rubstov (as well as to various other figures who have influenced activity-theory in the West, such as Dewey, Mead, and Wittgenstein). {{harvnb|Bakhurst|2009|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Political restrictions in its country of origin (Stalinist Russia) had suppressed the cultural-historical psychology – also known as the Vygotsky School – in the mid-thirties. This meant that the core "[[Activity theory|activity]]" concept remained confined to the field of psychology, although {{harvnb|Blunden|2010}}, in "''An Interdisciplinary Theory of Activity''", argues that it has the potential to evolve as a genuinely interdisciplinary concept. See also {{harvnb|Nussbaumer|2012|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vygotsky's important insight into the dynamics of consciousness was that it is essentially subjective and shaped by the history of  each individual's social and cultural experience.&lt;ref name="Vyg78"/&gt; Especially since the 1990s, CHAT has attracted a growing interest among academics worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kaptelinin|Nardi|2006}} Introduction&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere CHAT has been defined as "a cross-disciplinary framework for studying how humans purposefully transform natural and social reality, including themselves, as an ongoing culturally and historically [[Situated learning|situated]], materially and socially [[Cultural mediation|mediated]] process".&lt;ref&gt;CHAT explicitly incorporates the mediation of activities by ''society'', which means that it can be used to link concerns normally independently examined by sociologists of education and (social) psychologists. {{harvnb|Roth|Lee|2007}} and {{harvnb|Roth|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Core ideas are: 1) humans act collectively, learn by doing, and communicate in and via their actions; 2) humans make, employ, and adapt tools of all kinds to learn and communicate; and 3) community is central to the process of making and interpreting meaning – and thus to all forms of learning, communicating, and acting.&lt;ref name="Leont78"&gt;{{harvnb|Leontiev|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Activity Theory in a Nutshell. Ch 3 in {{harvnb|Kaptelinin|Nardi|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term CHAT was coined by Michael Cole&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cole|1996|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; and popularized by Yrjö  Engeström&lt;ref&gt;The activity theoretical framework, as recently as the 1990s, was still referred to as "''one of the best kept secrets of academia''" {{harvnb|Engeström|1993|page=64}}; {{harvnb|Roth|Lee|2007|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; to promote the unity of what, by the 1990s, had become a variety of currents&lt;ref&gt;Prominent among those currents are [[Cultural-historical psychology]], in use since the 1930s, and [[Activity theory]] in use since the 1960s.&lt;/ref&gt; harking back to Vygotsky's work.&lt;ref name="Stets05"&gt;{{harvnb|Stetsenko|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yama07"&gt;{{harvnb|Yamagata|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical overview==

===Origins: revolutionary Russia===
CHAT traces its lineage to [[dialectical materialism]], classical [[German philosophy]],&lt;ref name="Enge99"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In particular Goethe's [http://home.mira.net/~andy/works/goethe.htm romantic science] ideas which were later taken up by [[Hegel]]. The meaning of "activity" in the conceptual sense is rooted in the German word ''Tätigkeit''. Hegel is considered the first philosopher to point out that the development of humans' knowledge is not spiritually given, but developed in history from living and working in natural environments.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blunden, A. 2012, [http://home.mira.net/~andy/works/origins-chat.htm "The Origins of Cultural Historical Activity Theory"] ; Blunden, A. [http://ethicalpolitics.org/chat/Genealogy-CHAT.htm Genealogy of CHAT] (graph).&lt;/ref&gt; and the work of [[Lev Vygotsky]], [[Aleksei N. Leontiev]] and [[Aleksandr Luria]], known as ''"the founding troika"''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blunden|2011|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Cultural-historical psychology|cultural-historical]] approach to [[Social Psychology]]. In a radical departure from the [[behaviorism]] and [[reflexology]] that dominated much of psychology in the early 1920s, they formulated, in the spirit of [[Karl Marx]]'s [[Theses on Feuerbach]], the concept of activity, i.e., "artifact-mediated and object-oriented action".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vygotsky|1978|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"''A human individual never reacts directly (or merely with inborn reflexes) to the environment. Consciousness and conscious action must be the central object of study for psychological science, since it is this that distinguishes humanity. The relationship between human agent and objects of environment is mediated by cultural means, tools and signs. Human action has a tripartite structure.''"({{harvnb|CRADLE|2009}})&lt;/ref&gt; By bringing together the notion of history and culture in the understanding of human activity, they were able to transcend the [[Cartesian dualism]] between subject and object, internal and external, between people and society, between individual inner consciousness and the outer world of society.&lt;ref&gt;At the beginning of and into the mid-20th century, Psychology was dominated by schools of thought that ignored real life processes in psychological functioning (e.g. [[Gestalt psychology]], [[Behaviorism]] and [[Cognitivism (psychology)]]).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lev Vygotsky]], who created the foundation of cultural-historical psychology, based on the concept of mediation, published six books on psychology topics during a working life which spanned only ten years. He died of TB in 1934 at the age of 37. A.N. Leont'ev worked with Lev Vygotsky and Alexandr Luria from 1924 to 1930, collaborating on the development of a [[Marxist psychology]]. Leontiev left Vygotsky's group in Moscow in 1931, to take up a position in [[Kharkov]]. There he was joined by local psychologists, including Pyotr Galperin and [[Pyotr Zinchenko]].&lt;ref&gt;For a history of what came to be known as the [[Kharkov School of Psychology]] re: Yasnitsky &amp; Ferrari, 2008 in: History of Psychology Vol. 11, No. 2, 101–121.&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to work with Vygotsky for some time but, eventually, there was a split, although they continued to communicate with one another on scientific matters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/understanding-vygotsky-a-quest-for-synthesis/oclc/786677274?referer=null&amp;ht=edition Veer and Valsiner, 1991]&lt;/ref&gt; Leontiev returned to Moscow in 1934. Contrary to popular belief, Vygotsky's work per se was never banned in Stalinist&lt;ref&gt;''When Stalin succeeded Lenin in 1924, the Soviet Union gradually turned into a dictatorship.

(Ilienkov by his own hand. – see: [http://home.mira.net/~andy/works/soviet-psychology.htm Blunden, 2009 "Soviet Cultural Psychology"]).&lt;/ref&gt; contact was made with the West.

===Developments in the West===
Michael Cole, then a young [[Indiana University]] psychology post-graduate exchange student, arrived in Moscow in 1962 for a one-year stint of research under Alexandr Luria. Keenly aware of the gulf between Soviet and American psychology, he was one for the first Westerners to present Luria's and Vygotsky's idea to an Anglo-Saxon public.&lt;ref&gt;e.g.: Luria's [http://www.marxists.org/archive/luria/works/1979/mind/ "The Making of Mind"] translated by Cole.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.mira.net/~andy/works/soviet-psychology.htm Blunden, 2009].&lt;/ref&gt; This, and a steady flow of books translated from the Russian&lt;ref&gt;The earliest books translated into English are Lev Vygotsky's [http://www.marxists.org/archive/vygotsky/works/words/ "Thought and Language"](1962), Luria's [https://www.marxists.org/archive/luria/works/1976/problem.htm "Cognitive Development"] (1976), Leontiev's [http://www.marxists.org/archive/leontev/works/1978/index.htm|title= Activity, Consciousness, and Personality] (1978) and Wertsch's [http://news.wustl.edu/people/Pages/WertschJamesV.aspx "The Concept of Activity in Soviet Psychology"] (1981).&lt;/ref&gt; ensured the gradual establishment of a solid Cultural Psychology base in the west.&lt;ref&gt;"Historians may come to identify in Michael Cole the single most influential person for acquainting Western scholars to this tradition, both through his writings and through the mediating role of his Laboratory for Comparative Human Cognition (LCHC) at the University of California, San Diego" ({{harvnb|Roth|2007|page=190}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Another American scholar, James V. Wertsch, after completing his PhD at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1975, spent a year as a postdoctoral fellow in Moscow to study linguistics and neuropsychology.

ISCRAT became a formal legal organization with its own by-laws in [[Amsterdam]], 1992. Other ISCRAT conferences: Rome (1993), Moscow (1995), [[Aarhus]] (1998) and [[Amsterdam]] (2002), when ISCRAT and the Conference for Socio Cultural Research merged into ISCAR.

===The three generations of activity theory===
In his 1987 ''"Learning by expanding"'', Engeström&lt;ref name="Enge87"&gt;{{harvnb|Engestrōm|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; offers a very detailed account of the diverse sources, philosophical and psychological, that inform activity theory. In subsequent years, however, a simplified picture has emerged from his and other researchers' work, namely the idea that (to date) there are three principal 'stages' or 'generations'&lt;ref&gt;'Generations' does not imply a 'better-worse' value judgment. Each illustrates a different aspect and exists in its own right.&lt;/ref&gt; of activity theory, or "cultural-historical activity theory (CHAT).&lt;ref name="Eng09b"&gt;{{harvnb|Engeström|2009b}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yama10"&gt;{{harvnb|Yamagata|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nussbaumer|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Enge99a"&gt;{{harvnb|Engeström|1999a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bakh09"&gt;{{harvnb|Bakhurst|2009|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst the first generation built on Vygotsky's notion of mediated action, from the individual's perspective, and the second generation built on Leont'ev's notion of activity system, with emphasis on the collective,&lt;ref&gt;An activity system is a collective in which one or more human actors labor to cyclically transform an object (a raw material or problem) in order to repeatedly achieve an outcome (a desired result). {{harvnb|Spinuzzi|2012|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; the third generation, which appeared in the mid-nineties, builds on the idea of multiple interacting activity systems focused on a partially shared object, and boundary-crossings between them.&lt;ref name="Eng09b"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0742051X08001698 | doi=10.1016/j.tate.2008.09.014 | volume=25 | issue=3 | title=Using activity systems analysis to identify inner contradictions in teacher professional development | year=2009 | journal=Teaching and Teacher Education | pages=507–517 | last1 = Yamagata-Lynch | first1 = Lisa C. | last2 = Haudenschild | first2 = Michael T.}}; Engeström, 2008, [http://lchc.ucsd.edu/mca/Paper/ISCARkeyEngestrom.pdf "The Future of Activity Theory" p. 6].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AkkerBakker"&gt;{{harvnb|Akkerman|Bakker|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====First generation – Vygotsky====
The first generation emerges from Vygotsky's theory of [[cultural mediation]], which was a response to [[behaviorism]]'s explanation of consciousness, or the development of the human mind, by reducing "mind" to a series of atomic components or structures associated primarily with the brain as "stimulus – response" (S-R) processes. Vygotsky argued that the relationship between a human subject and an object is never direct but must be sought in society and culture as they evolve historically, rather than in the human brain or individual mind unto itself.&lt;ref&gt;Vygotsky saw the past and present as fused within the individual, that the "''present is seen in the light of history''" ({{harvnb|Vygotsky|1978}}).&lt;/ref&gt; His cultural-historical psychology attempted to account for the social origins of language and thinking.  To Vygotsky, consciousness emerges from human activity mediated by artifacts (tools) and signs.&lt;ref name="Vyg78"&gt;{{harvnb|Vygotsky|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;These artifacts, which can be physical tools, such as hammers, ovens, or computers; cultural artifacts, including language; or theoretical artifacts, like algebra or feminist standpoint theory, are created and/or transformed in the course of an activity, which, in the first generation framework, happens at the individual level.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Vygotsky Basic Mediated Action.jpg|thumb|285px|First Generation CHAT]] This idea of semiotic mediation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wells | first1 = G | year = 2007 | title = Semiotic Mediation, Dialogue and Construction of Knowledge | url = http://people.ucsc.edu/~gwells/Files/Papers_Folder/Semiotic%20Mediation%20and%20Ed.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Human Development | volume = 50 | issue = 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is embodied in Vygotsky's famous triangular model&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vygotsky|1978|page=40}}: this original diagram – (in which "X" stands for 'mediation') – has subsequently been reformulated by, among others, the original [http://www.cs.hut.fi/u/aura/paivin_seminaari/activity_theory.pdf triangle] being inverted.&lt;/ref&gt; which features the Subject (S), Object (O), and Mediating Artifact triad:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Engeström|2001|page=134}}. Vygotsky's triangular representation of mediated action attempts to explain human consciousness development in a manner that did not rely on dualistic stimulus–response (S-R) associations.&lt;/ref&gt; in mediated action the Subject, Object, and Artifact stand in a dialectical relationship whereby each affects the other and the activity as a whole.&lt;ref name="Stets05"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yama07"&gt;{{harvnb|Yamagata|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"''the dialectic relationship between subject and object as a fundamental unit of analysis for all human endeavour''" {{harvnb|Hasan|2007|page=3.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For Vygotsky's idea of a ''"complex, mediated act"'' commonly expressed as a triad of subject, object and mediating artifact, see {{harvnb|Vygotsky|1987|page=40.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vygotsky argues that the use of signs leads to a specific structure of human behavior, which breaks away from mere biological development allowing the creation of new forms of culturally-based psychological processes – hence the importance of (cultural-historical) context: individuals could no longer be understood without their cultural environment, nor society without the ''agency'' of the individuals who use and produced these artifacts. The objects became cultural entities, and action oriented towards the objects became the key to understanding the human psyche.&lt;ref&gt;Vygotsky makes the point that ''"man himself determines his behavior with the help of an artificially created stimulus means."'' (as cited by Norris Minick in Vol I of "The Collected Works of L.S. Vygotsky", 1987, PLENUM – New York/London, p.21);&lt;/ref&gt; In the Vygotskyan framework the unit of analysis, however, remains principally the individual. First-generation activity theory has been used to understand individual behavior by examining the ways in which a person's objectivized actions are culturally ''mediated''.&lt;ref&gt;''Mediation'' is perhaps the key theoretical idea behind activity: we don't just use tools and symbol systems; instead, our everyday lived experience is significantly mediated and intermediated by our use of tools and symbols systems. Activity theory helps frame, therefore, our understanding of such mediation.&lt;/ref&gt;  Besides a strong focus on material and symbolic mediation, internalization&lt;ref&gt;In Vygotskyan psychology internalization is a theoretical concept that explains how individuals process what they learned through mediated action in the development of individual consciousness.&lt;/ref&gt; of external (social, societal, and cultural) forms of mediation, another important, aspect of first generation CHAT is the concept of the [[zone of proximal development]] (ZPD),&lt;ref name="Vyg78"&gt;{{harvnb|Vygotsky|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning, as advanced in ''Mind in Society'' (1978), ''"the distance between the actual developmental level as determined by independent problem solving and the level of potential development as determined through problem solving under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable peers"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vygotsky|1978|page=86}} –  Restated, ZPD is the theoretical range of what a performer can do with competent peers and assistance, as compared with what can be accomplished on one's own({{harvnb|Andersson|2013|page=21}}; DeVane &amp; Squire in {{harvnb|Jonassen|Land|2012|page=245}}).&lt;/ref&gt; ZDP is one of the major legacies of Vygotsky's work in the social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;see for example [[Collaborative learning]].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Second generation – Leontiev====
While Vygotsky formulated practical human activity as the general explanatory category in human psychology, he did not fully clarify its precise nature. The second generation moves, beyond Vygotsky's individually-focused to A.N. Leontiev's&lt;ref&gt;Leontiev, (variously spelled Leont'ev/Leontyev) was, with [[Alexander Luria]], one of Vygotsky's pupils in the late 1920s and 1930s. After Vygotsky's death, Leontyev became the principal theoretical contributor within the Vygotskian social-historical school.&lt;/ref&gt; collective model. In Engeström's&lt;ref name="Enge87"/&gt; now famous graphic depiction of second-generation activity, the unit of analysis has been expanded to include collective motivated activity toward an object, making room for understanding how collective action by social groups mediates activity.&lt;ref&gt;Leontiev's breakthrough was twofold: first he theorized activity as resulting from the confluence of a human subject, the object of his/her activity (predmet/[[w:ru:Предмет|Предмет(Russian)]] "the target or content of a thought or action" (Kaptelinin, 2005, p. 6), and the tools (including symbol systems) that mediate the object(ive); second, he saw activity as essentially tripartite in structure, being composed of unconscious operations on/with tools, conscious but finite actions which are goal-directed, and higher level activities which are object-oriented and driven by motives (Leontiev, at times, seems to conflate object and motive, which is potentially problematic).&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the inclusion of ''community'', ''rules'', ''division of labor'' and the importance of analyzing their interactions with each other.&lt;ref name="Enge99a"/&gt; Rules may be explicit or implicit. Division of labor refers to the explicit and implicit organization of the community involved in the activity.  Engeström&lt;ref name="Enge87"/&gt; articulated the clearest distinction between classic Vygotskian psychology, which emphasizes the way semiotic and cultural systems mediate human ''action'', and Leontiev's second-generation  CHAT, which is focused on the meditational effects of the systemic organization of human ''activity''. [[File:Second Generation CHAT.jpg|thumb|285px|Second Generation CHAT]] In insisting that activity only exists in relation to rules, community and division of labor, Engeström expands ''the unit of analysis'' for studying human behavior from that of individual activity to a collective ''activity system''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Engeström|1987}} first popularized the triangular representation of the activity system in chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;While the ''unit of analysis'', for Vygotsky, is "individual activity" and, for Leontiev, the "collective activity system", for [[Jean Lave]] and others working around [[situated cognition]] the unit of analysis is "practice", "[[community of practice]]", and "participation". Other scholars analyze "the relationships between the individual's psychological development and the development of social systems". re: Minick in {{harvnb|Cole|Engeström|Vasquez|1997|page=125}}; {{harvnb|Lave|Wenger|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collective ''activity system'' includes the social, psychological, cultural and institutional perspectives in the analysis. In this conceptualization context or activity systems are inherently related to what Engeström argues are the deep-seated material practices and socioeconomic structures of a given culture. These societal dimensions had not been taken sufficiently into account by Vygotsky's, earlier, more 'simple' triadic model:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leontiev|1979|page=163}};{{harvnb|Engeström|1999|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hard07"&gt;{{harvnb|Hardman|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Leontiev's understanding, thought and cognition should be understood as a part of social life – as a part of the means of production and systems of social relations on one hand, and the intentions of individuals in certain social conditions on the other.&lt;ref name="Leont78"&gt;{{harvnb|Leontiev|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the second generation diagram, activity is positioned in the middle, mediation at the top, adding rules, community and division of labor at the bottom. The minimum components of an ''activity system'' are:  the subject; the object; outcome; mediating instruments/tools/artifacts; rules and signs; community and division of labor.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his famous example of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20041110023910/http://home.hio.no/~kristihh/1_lektor/paper/hunt.htm 'primeval collective hunt'],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leontiev|1981|page=210–213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leontiev clarifies the crucial difference between an individual ''action'' ("the beater frightening game") and a collective ''activity'' ("the hunt"). While individuals' actions (frightening game) are different from the overall ''goal'' of the activity (hunt), they all share in the same ''motive'' (obtaining food). ''Operations'', on the other hand, are driven by the conditions and tools at hand, i.e. the objective circumstances under which the hunt is taking place. To understand the separate actions of the individuals, one needs to understand the broader ''motive'' behind the activity as a whole: this accounts for the three hierarchical levels of human functioning:&lt;ref name="Enge87"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kuutti, K. in {{harvnb|Nardi|1996|page=30}};  {{harvnb|Roth|Lee|2007}}; {{harvnb|Hardman|2007}}; {{harvnb|Bozalek, et al.|2014|page=15.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''object''-related motives drive the collective activity (top); ''goals'' drive individual/group action(s) (middle); ''conditions'' and ''tools'' drive automated operations (lower level).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leontyev|2009|page=400–405}} ; {{harvnb|Blunden|2011|page=201}}; {{harvnb|Nussbaumer|2012|page=39}}; DeVane &amp; Squire in {{harvnb|Jonassen|Land|2012|page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Third generation – Engeström et al.====
After Vygotsky's foundational work on the individual's higher psychological functions&lt;ref name="Vyg78"&gt;{{harvnb|Vygotsky|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Leontiev's extension of these insights to collective activity systems,&lt;ref&gt;Engeström in {{harvnb|Engeström|Miettinen|Punamäki|1999|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; questions of diversity and dialogue between different traditions or perspectives became increasingly serious challenges, when, especially in the post-1990s, activity theory 'went international'. The work of Michael Cole and Yrjö Engeström in the 1970s and 1980s – mostly in parallel, but occasionally in collaboration – brought activity theory to a much wider audience of scholars in Scandinavia and North America.&lt;ref&gt;"[Activity Theory]  ''is not only used in Russia, where it originated, but also in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Norway, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, the United States and other countries.''". ({{harvnb|Kaptelinin|Nardi|2006|page=6}})&lt;/ref&gt; Once the lives and biographies of all the participants and the history of the wider community are taken into account, ''multiple activity systems'' need to be considered, positing, according to Engeström, the need for a "third generation" to "''develop conceptual tools to understand dialogue, multiple perspectives, and networks of interacting activity Systems''".&lt;ref&gt;"''Activities do not exist in isolation, they are part of a broader system of relations in which they have meaning.''" ({{harvnb|Lave|Wenger|1991|page=53.}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Enge01"&gt;{{harvnb|Engeström|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Enge09a"&gt;{{harvnb|Engeström|2009a}}&lt;/ref&gt; This larger canvas of active individuals (and researchers) embedded in organizational, political, and discursive practices constitutes a tangible advantage of second- and third-generation CHAT over its earlier Vygotskian ancestor, which focused on mediated action in relative isolation&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roth|Lee|2007|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third generation activity theory is the application of ''Activity Systems Analysis'' (ASA)&lt;ref name="Yama10"&gt;{{harvnb|Yamagata|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See "Activity Systems Analysis" (ASA) section below.&lt;/ref&gt; in developmental research where investigators take a participatory and interventionist role in the participants' activities and change their experiences. [[File:Third Generation CHAT.jpg|thumb|285px|Third Generation CHAT]] Engeström's&lt;ref name="Enge87"/&gt; now famous diagram, or ''basic activity triangle'', – (which adds rules/norms, intersubjective community relations, and division of labor, as well as multiple activity systems sharing an object) – has become the principal third generation model among the research community for analysing individuals and groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blunden|2012|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Engeström summarizes the current state of CHAT with five principles:
# The activity system as primary unit of analysis: the basic third generation model includes minimally two interacting activity systems. 
# Multi-voicedness: an activity system is always a community of multiple points of views, traditions and interests.
# Historicity: activity systems take shape and get transformed over long stretches of time. Potentials and problems can only be understood against the background of their own histories. 
# The central role of contradictions as sources of change and development.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Engeström|2001|page=137.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Activity Systems' possibility for ''expansive transformation'' (cycles of qualitative transformation):  when object and motive are reconceptualized a radically wider horizon opens up.&lt;ref name="Enge01"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nygård|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Most often, learning technologists have used third-generation CHAT as a guiding theoretical framework to understand how technologies are adopted, adapted, and configured through use in complex social situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jonasen|Land|2012|page=242}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hardman|2007}} Introduction: "''A flurry of recent publications indicates that Activity Theory is proving a useful tool for studying work setting''" She mentions, among others, Product design, Collaborative activity, Studies in creativity, Educational interventions. Although not as widely known in the US, [http://faculty.washington.edu/kfoot/Publications/Foot-CHAT-explored-dist-tf.pdf Kirsten Foot] mentions use of CHAT in Educational curricula development, Mental health care, Organizational processes and Public policy.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;More recently, Engeström has acknowledged that the third generation model limited to analysing 'reasonably well-bounded' systems and that, in view of new, often web-based participatory practices a rethink is needed. (See "[[#"Fourth generation"|Fourth Generation]]" below.)&lt;/ref&gt;

"''Objectivized Activity''" is perceived to be closer to both the letter and the spirit of dynamic, interactive, dialectical weighting of Leontiev's original ''predmetnaya dyaetel'nost''.&lt;/ref&gt; has been used in a Social Development context.

===CHAT-inspired research and practice since the 1980s===
Especially over the last two decades, CHAT has offered a theoretical lens informing research and practice, in that it posits that learning takes place through collective activities that are purposefully conducted around a common object.  Starting from the premise that learning is a social and cultural process that draws on historical achievements, its [[systems thinking]]-based perspectives allow insights into the real world.&lt;ref name="Enge01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Enge09a"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mutizwa Mukute, M.&amp; Lotz-Sisitka, H. 2012 [http://lchc.ucsd.edu/mca/Journal/pdfs/19-4-mukute.pdf "Working With Cultural-Historical Activity Theory and Critical Realism to Investigate and Expand Farmer Learning in Southern Africa"]. Rhodes University. SA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Foot14"&gt;{{harvnb|Foot|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Change Laboratory (CL)====
Change Laboratory (CL) is a CHAT-based method for formative intervention in activity systems and for research on their developmental potential as well as processes of expansive learning, collaborative concept-formation, and transformation of practices, elaborated in the mid-nineties&lt;ref&gt;In 1997, according to [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6880603 Santally et al., 2014, p. 3]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sannino, 2008 [http://lchc.ucsd.edu/mca/Journal/pdfs/15-3-sannino.pdf "From Talk to Action: Experiencing Interlocution in Developmental Interventions"] Sannino sees in Yves Clot's Vygotsky-inspired [http://tap.sagepub.com/content/21/5/681.full.pdf '''Clinic of Activity'''] (''Clinique de l'Activité'') a potentially complementary – (to CL, that is) – intervention method. (See also Clot, Yves, 2009 [http://lchc.ucsd.edu/MCA/Mail/xmcamail.2012_01.dir/pdfHqmCdPgVef.pdf Clinic of Activity: The Dialogue as Instrument] in {{harvnb|Sannino|et al|2009}}).&lt;/ref&gt; by the Finnish Developmental Work Research [http://www.edu.helsinki.fi/activity/ (DWR)] group.&lt;ref&gt;Which became [http://www.helsinki.fi/cradle/ CRADLE] in 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Enge05a"&gt;{{harvnb|Engeström|2005a}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The CL method relies on collaboration between the practitioners of the activity being analyzed and transformed, and academic researchers or interventionists supporting and facilitating collective developmental processes.&lt;ref name="Enge01"/&gt; On the basis of Engeström's theory of ''expansive learning'',&lt;ref name="Enge87"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Expansive learning is described by {{harvnb|Engeström|2008|page=130}} as a process which "''begins with individual subjects questioning accepted practices, and it gradually expands into a collective movement or institution.'' – The theory enables a "''longitudinal and rich analysis of inter-organizational learning [] by using observational as well as interventionist designs in studies of work and organization''". ([http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1108/13665620710777084 Engeström &amp; Kerosuo, 2007])&lt;/ref&gt; the foundation of an interventionist research approach at DWR&lt;ref name="Enge05a"/&gt; was elaborated in the 1980s, and developed further in the 1990s as an intervention method now known as ''Change Laboratory''.&lt;ref name="EngeVirkk"&gt;{{harvnb|Engeström|Virkkunen et al.|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "CRAD09"&gt;{{harvnb|CRADLE|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; CL interventions are used both to study the conditions of change and to help those working in organizations to develop their work, drawing on participant observation, interviews, and the recording and videotaping of meetings and work practices.  Initially, with the help of an external interventionist, the first stimulus that ''is beyond the actors' present capabilities'', is produced in the Change Laboratory by collecting first-hand empirical data on problematic aspects of the activity. This data may comprise difficult client cases, descriptions of recurrent disturbances and ruptures in the process of producing the outcome. Steps in the CL process: Step 1 Questioning; Step 2 Analysis;  Step 3 Modeling; Step 4 Examining; Step 5 Implementing; Step 6 Reflecting; Step 7 Consolidating.  These seven action steps for increased understanding are described by Engeström as ''expansive learning'', or phases of an outwardly expanding spiral,&lt;ref&gt;Virkkunen, Makinen &amp; Lintula in {{harvnb|Daniels|et al.|2010|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; while multiple kinds of actions can take place at any time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Engestrőm|Sannino|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phases of the model simply allow for the identification and analysis of the dominant action type during a particular period of time. These learning actions are provoked by contradictions.&lt;ref&gt;Engeström. Y. in: {{harvnb|Engeström|Miettinen|Punamäki|1999|page=384}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Contradictions are not simply conflicts or problems, but are "''historically accumulating structural tensions within and between activity systems''" ({{harvnb|Engeström|2001|page= 137}}).&lt;/ref&gt; CL is used by a team or work unit or by collaborating partners across the organizational boundaries, initially with the help of an interventionist-researcher.&lt;ref name="Foot14"&gt;{{harvnb|Foot|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EngeVirkk"/&gt; The CL method has been used in agricultural contexts,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [http://xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/14514153/1465618386/name/14.%20Cultural%20Historical%20Activity%20Theory%20Expansive%20Learning%20and%20Agency%20in%20Permaculture.pdf Mukute, M., 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; educational and media settings,&lt;ref&gt;[https://helda.helsinki.fi/handle/10138/19805 Teräs, M., 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; health care&lt;ref&gt;[http://ethesis.helsinki.fi/julkaisut/kay/kasva/vk/kerosuo/abstract.html Kerosuo, H., 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tap.sagepub.com/content/21/5/598.short Engeström, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; and learning support.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6880603 Santally et al., 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Other examples, among others, in {{harvnb|Daniels|et al.|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Activity systems analysis (ASA)====
''Activity systems analysis'' is a CHAT-based method,&lt;ref&gt;Which uses Activity Theory concepts such as mediated action, goal-directed activity and dialectical relationship between the organism and the environment.&lt;/ref&gt; discussed in {{harvnb|Engeström|1987}}/{{harvnb|Engeström|1993}} and in Cole &amp; Engeström, 1993,&lt;ref&gt;Cole, M., &amp; Engeström, Y. (1993). "A cultural–historical approach to distributed cognition" in: [https://www.amazon.com/Distributed-Cognitions-Psychological-Considerations-Computational/dp/0521574234 Salomon, G (Ed), 1993.]&lt;/ref&gt; for understanding human activity in real-world situations with data collection, analysis, and presentation methods that address the complexities of human activity in natural settings aimed to advance both theory and practice. It is based on Vygotsky's concept of mediated action and captures human activity in a triangle model that includes the subject, tool, object, rule, community, and division of labor.&lt;ref name="Enge87"/&gt; Subjects are participants in an activity, motivated toward a purpose or attainment of the object. The object can be the goal of an activity, the subject's motives for participating in an activity, and the material products that subjects gain through an activity. Tools are socially shared cognitive and/or material resources that subjects can use to attain the object. Informal or formal rules regulate the subject's participation while engaging in an activity. The community is the group or organization to which subjects belong. The division of labor is the shared participation responsibilities in the activity determined by the community. Finally, the outcome is the consequences that the subject faces because of his/her actions driven by the object. These outcomes can encourage or hinder the subject's participation in future activities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/2593117/Activity_systems_analysis_methods Yamagata "Activity Systems Analysis Methods]&lt;/ref&gt; In Part 2 of her video "''Using Activity Theory to understand human behaviour''", {{harvnb|vanderRiet|2010}} shows how activity theory is applied to the problem of behavior change and HIV and AIDs (in South Africa). The video focuses on sexual activity as the activity of the system, and illustrates how an ''Activity System Analysis'', through a historical and current account of the activity, provides a way of understanding lack of behavior change in response to HIV and AIDS. In her eponymous book ''"Activity Systems Analysis Methods."'', {{harvnb|Yamagata|2010|page=37ss}} describes seven ASA case studies which fall ''"into four distinct work clusters. These clusters include works that help (a) understand developmental work research (DWR), (b) describe real-world learning situations, (c) design human computer interaction systems, and (d) plan solutions to complicated work-based problems"''.

====Human–computer interaction (HCI)====
When HCI&lt;ref&gt;[[Human-Computer Interaction]] – the study, planning, design and uses of the interfaces between people ([[user (computing)|user]]s) and computers.&lt;/ref&gt; first appeared on the scene as a separate field of study in the early 1980s, HCI adopted the [[information processing]] paradigm of computer science as the model for human cognition, predicated on prevalent [[cognitive psychology]] criteria, which, it was soon realized, failed to account for individuals' interests, needs and frustrations involved, nor of the fact that the technology critically depends on complex, meaningful, social, and dynamic contexts in which it takes place.&lt;ref&gt;Kuutti in {{harvnb|Nardi|1996|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kaptelinin|Nardi|2006|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adopting a CHAT theoretical perspective had important implications for understanding how people use interactive technologies: the realization, for example, that a computer is typically an object of activity rather than a mediating artefact means that people interact with the world through computers, rather than with computer 'objects'.&lt;ref name="KaptNard6"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaptelinin, Victor "Activity Theory" in {{harvnb|Soegaard|Friis|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Susanne Bødker|Bødker, S.]] "A Human Activity approach to User Interfaces"  in: [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1207/s15327051hci0403_1 Human-Computer Interaction, 1989, Volume 4, pp.171–195]&lt;/ref&gt; A number of diverse methodologies outlining techniques for human–computer interaction design have emerged since the rise of the field in the 1980s. Most design methodologies stem from a model for how users, designers, and technical systems interact. [[Bonnie Nardi]] produced the – hitherto – most applicable collection of activity theoretical HCI literature.&lt;ref name="KaptNard6"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nardi|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Systemic-structural activity theory (SSAT)====
SSAT builds on the general theory of activity to provide an effective basis for both experimental and analytic methods of studying human performance, using carefully developed units of analysis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bedny | first1 = G. | last2 = Karwowski | first2 = W. | year = 2003 | title = A Systemic-Structural Activity Approach to the Design of Human–Computer Interaction Tasks | url = | journal = International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction | volume = 16 | issue = 2| pages = 235–260 | doi=10.1207/s15327590ijhc1602_06| citeseerx = 10.1.1.151.8384 }}&lt;/ref&gt; SSAT approaches cognition both as a process and as a structured system of actions or other functional information-processing units, developing a taxonomy of human activity through the use of structurally organized units of analysis. The systemic-structural approach to activity design and analysis involves identifying the available means of work, tools and objects; their relationship with possible strategies of work activity; existing constraints on activity performance; social norms and rules; possible stages of object transformation; and changes in the structure of activity during skills acquisition.This method is demonstrated by applying it to the study of a human–computer interaction task.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bedny, I.|Karwowski, W.|Bedny G.|2014}}; {{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/10447310903575507 | volume=26 | issue=4 | title=A Method of Human Reliability Assessment Based on Systemic-Structural Activity Theory | year=2010 | journal=International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction | pages=377–402 | last1 = Bedny | first1 = I.

==Future==

===Evolving field of study===
The strengths of CHAT are grounded both in its long historical roots and extensive contemporary use: it offers a philosophical and cross-disciplinary perspective for analyzing diverse human practices as development processes in which both individual and social levels are interlinked, as well as interactions and boundary-crossings.&lt;ref name="AkkerBakker"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crossing boundaries involves "''encountering difference, entering into [] unfamiliar territory, requiring cognitive retooling''".  Tuomi-Grōhn &amp; Engeström, 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pU-ZCkQExcIC  "New Perspectives on Transfer and Boundary Crossing" p.4.]&lt;/ref&gt; between activity systems&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Engeström|1999c}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kuutti, N. Ch 2 in {{harvnb|Nardi|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the focus of studies of organizational learning has increasingly shifted away from learning within single organizations or organizational units, towards learning in multi‐organizational or inter‐organizational networks, as well as to the exploration and better understanding of interactions in their social context, multiple contexts and cultures, and the dynamics and development of particular activities. This shift has generated, among others, such concepts as "networks of learning"&lt;ref&gt;Miettinen in {{harvnb|Engeström|et al.|1999|page=325}} "Transcending traditional school learning: Teachers' work and networks of learning."&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[networked learning]]",&lt;ref&gt;Wikipedia, launched in 2001, is one of the most successful instances of networked learning to date.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Engeström|Kerosuo|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[coworking]],&lt;ref name= "EngSann"&gt;{{harvnb|Sannino|et al.|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and knotworking.&lt;ref name="Enge04"&gt;{{harvnb|Engeström|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spinuzzi|2011}}; {{harvnb|Spinuzzi|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Industry of late has seen strong growth in nonemployer firms (NEFs), thanks to changes in long-term employment trends and developments in mobile technology&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. {{harvnb|Castells|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; which have led to more work from remote locations, more distance collaboration, and more work organized around temporary projects.&lt;ref name="Spin14"&gt;{{harvnb|Spinuzzi|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developments such as these and new forms of social production or [[commons-based peer production]], such as e.g. [[open source]]&lt;ref&gt;Software, the source code of which is available for modification or enhancement by anyone.&lt;/ref&gt; development and cultural production in [[peer-to-peer]] (P2P) networks, have become a key focus in Engeström's more recent work.&lt;ref name="Enge04"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Social production processes are simultaneous, multi-directional and often reciprocal. The density and complexity of these processes blur distinctions between process and structure. The object of the activity is unstable, resists control and standardization, and requires rapid integration of expertise from various locations and traditions. (Engeström in {{harvnb|Sannino|et al.|2009|page=309}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. [https://web.archive.org/web/20150128132610/http://www.open.ac.uk/opencetl/files/opencetl/file/ecms/web-content/Engestrom-(2007)-From-communities-of-practice-to-mycorrhizae.pdf Engeström] in: [https://books.google.com/books?hl=es&amp;lr=&amp;id=Mv6H0dm1CvgC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1985&amp;dq=Communities+of+practice:+Critical+perspectives&amp;ots=O3Ye0f0Uop&amp;sig=ZSIypdAKreTaGxOdWl-TxbClnfA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Communities%20of%20practice%3A%20Critical%20perspectives&amp;f=false Hughes, Jewson &amp; Unwin, 2007] Ch. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Fourth generation"===
The rapid rise of new forms of activities characterised by web-based social and participatory practices,&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Spinuzzi, 2010: shift from bureaucracies (1970s), to adhocracies (1990s), to all-edge adhocracies (2010s), in: [http://www.slideshare.net/spinuzzi/all-edge-understanding-the-new-workplace-networks "''All Edge: Understanding the New Workplace Networks''".]&lt;/ref&gt; 
,&lt;ref&gt;By 2008, Engeström's examples become 'less bounded': ''runaway objects'' – or 'partially shared large-scale objects in complex, distributed multi-activity fields'-, ''wildfire'', and ''mycorrhizae-like'' activities, are examples of this shift. ({{harvnb|Engeström|2009b}}; Engeström in {{harvnb|Sannino|2009|page=310}}; {{harvnb|Spinuzzi|2011}}).&lt;/ref&gt; phenomena such as [[distributed workforce]] and the dominance of knowledge work, prompts a rethink of the third generation model, bringing with it the need, as suggested by Engestrōm, for a new, ''fourth generation'' activity system model.&lt;ref&gt;aka "4GAT" e.g. {{harvnb|Spinuzzi|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sannino|et al.|2009|page=310}} Ch. 19 "The Future of Activity Theory: A rough draft."&lt;/ref&gt; which activity theorists indeed have been working on in recent years.&lt;ref name="Daniels10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EngSann"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fourth Generation (4GAT) analysis should allow better examination of how activity networks interact and interpenetrate, and, at times, contradict each other. People "''working alone together''" may illuminate other examples of distributed, interorganizational, collaborative knowledge work.{{harvnb|Spinuzzi|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fourth generation CHAT, the object(ive) will typically comprise multiple perspectives and contexts and be inherently transient; collaborations between actors, too, are likely to be temporary, with multiple boundary crossings between interrelated activities.&lt;ref name="AkkerBakker"/&gt; Fourth-generation activity theorists have specifically developed activity theory to better accommodate Castells's (and others') insights into how work organization has shifted in the [[network society]]: they hence will focus less on the workings of individual activity systems (often represented by triangles) and more on the interactions across activity systems functioning in networks.&lt;ref name="Spin14"&gt;{{harvnb|Spinuzzi|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Yamazumi|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For an example of a fourth generation analytical diagram see {{harvnb|Spinuzzi|2014|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2017 ISCAR congress (August, Quebec City) has the following theme: ''''Taking a 360° view of the landscape of cultural-historical activity research:The state of our scholarship in practice''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14177">The '''Dalton Plan''' is an educational concept created by [[Helen Parkhurst]]. It is inspired by the intellectual ferment at the turn of the 20th century. Educational thinkers such as [[Maria Montessori]] and [[John Dewey]] influenced Parkhurst while she created the Dalton Plan. Their aim was to achieve a balance between a child's talent and the needs of the community.

==Helen Parkhurst==
The American teacher Helen Parkhurst (1886-1973) developed at the beginning of the twentieth century the Dalton Plan to reform the then current pedagogics and the then usual manner of classroom management. She wanted to break the teacher-centered lockstep teaching. During her first experiment, which she implemented in a small elementary school as a young teacher in 1904, she noticed that when students are given freedom for self-direction and self-pacing and to help one another, their motivation increases considerably and they learn a lot more. In a later experiment in 1911 and 1912 Parkhurst re-organized the education in a large school for nine to fourteen year-olds. Instead of each grade, each subject was appointed its own teacher and its own classroom. The subject teachers made assignments: they converted the subject matter for each grade into learning assignments. In this way, learning became the students’ own work; they could carry out their work independently, work at their own pace and plan their work themselves. The classroom turned into a laboratory, a place where students are working, furnished and equipped as work spaces, tailored to meet the requirements of specific subjects. Useful and attractive learning materials, instruments and reference books were put within the students’ reach. The benches were replaced by large tables to facilitate co-operation and group instruction. This second experiment formed the basis for the next experiments, those in Dalton and New York, from 1919 onwards. The only addition was the use of graphs, charts enabling students to keep track of their own progress in each subject. From now on it was called the Dalton Plan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://xs4all.academia.edu/PietvanderPloeg/Dalton-education "Dalton education"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921 en 1922 Parkhurst explained the theory of the Dalton Plan in a series of articles published in “The Times Educational Supplement” and in her book “Education on the Dalton Plan”. It can be reconstructed as follows. The Dalton Plan is an “efficiency measure”: “a simple and economic reorganization of the school” (Parkhurst, 1922, 46). Lockstep teaching is not efficient, because: it is the teacher who does all the work. The Dalton Plan “creates conditions which enable ... the learner to learn” (34). Learning is the same as experience: “Experience is the best and indeed the only real teacher” (152). The school has to provide for sufficient experience. This cannot be achieved by keeping students as passive recipients, separating them from one another, holding them in one place, requiring them to remain silent, making them learn lessons by heart and subjecting them to whole class recitation. We can provide for experience through the “liberation of the pupil” and the “socialization of the school” (46). In the Dalton Plan, freedom is the opportunity to do the schoolwork oneself, to organize it oneself (how where and when) and to carry it out at one’s own pace, particularly to do it undisturbed and to work with commitment and concentration. Self-activity brings about experience. Something similar applies in the Dalton Plan to interaction and co-operation. When students are permitted to interact and work freely with one another and with teachers, in varying groups, in varied locations, with varied resources and materials, they come into contact with one another, the teachers, the subject matter and the learning materials in different ways. This means more experience and consequently more learning.&lt;ref&gt;[https://xs4all.academia.edu/PietvanderPloeg/Dalton-education "Dalton education"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==World wide==

In the 1920s and 1930s,, Dalton education was spread throughout the world. There is no certainty regarding the exact numbers of Dalton schools, but there was Dalton education in America, Australia, England, Germany, the Netherlands, the Soviet Union, India, China and Japan. Particularly in the Netherlands, China and Japan, Dalton education has remained in existence. In recent years there has been a revival of international interest. It crops up again, for instance, in England, Germany, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The Netherlands is the country with the highest density of Dalton schools. In 2013 there were five hundred; most of them elementary schools.{{fact|date=July 2017}} Comprising five percent of all elementary schools, Dalton education is by far the largest educational reform movement in the Netherlands.{{fact|date=July 2017}}  And, contrary to Montessori, [[Jenaplan_schools|Jena Plan]] and [[Waldorf education]], it is steadily on the increase. The only Dalton school in the USA, is the school that Helen Parkhurst founded herself in 1919, and which she was subsequently to direct for more than twenty years: the Dalton School in New York. It is a renowned school. But today its fame is not due to its origins as an experiment in progressive education: the [[Dalton School]] is one of the most expensive private schools in New York.&lt;ref&gt;[https://xs4all.academia.edu/PietvanderPloeg/Dalton-education "Dalton education"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
{{Expand section|date=October 2013}}
Parkhurst's specific objectives were as follows:&lt;ref name=dewey&gt;Evelyn Dewey, [https://archive.org/details/daltonlaboratory00deweiala The Dalton Laboratory Plan], E.P. Dutton, 1922&lt;/ref&gt;
# To tailor each student's program to his or her needs, interests and abilities. 
# To promote each student's [[independence]] and dependability. 
# To enhance the student's social skills. 
# To increase their sense of responsibility toward others.

She developed a three-part plan that continues to be the structural foundation of a Dalton education:&lt;ref name=dewey /&gt;
# The [[House system|House]], a social community of students.
# The Assignment, a monthly goal which students contract to complete.
# The Laboratory, a subject-based classrooms intended to be the center of the educational experience. The laboratory involves students from fourth grade through the end of secondary education.

Students move between subject "laboratories" (classrooms) and explore themes at their own pace.

==Introduction in UK==

On May 27, 1920, a very enthusiastic article describing the working of the Dalton Plan in detail was published in the ''Times' Educational Supplement''.  Parkhurst "has given to the secondary school the leisure and culture of the University student; she has uncongested the curriculum; she has abolished the teacher's nightly preparation of classes and the child's nightmare of homework.  At the same time the children under her regime cover automatically all the ground prescribed for examinations 'of matriculation standard,' and examination failures among them are nil."{{cn|date=February 2017}}

The Dalton Plan is a method of education by which pupils work at their own pace, and receive individual help from the teacher when necessary. There is no formal class instruction.  Students draw up time-tables and are responsible for finishing the work on their syllabuses or assignments.  Students are also encouraged to help each other with their work. The underlying aim of the Dalton Plan is to achieve the highest mental, moral, physical and spiritual development of the pupil.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

In the spring of 1921, English headmistress [[Rosa Bassett]] went to the Children's University School and stayed with Parkhurst. They spent hours talking about education. Parkhurst found Bassett in complete agreement with her ideas: "She was Dalton," Parkhurst wrote 50 years later. She described Bassett and Belle Rennie as the two people in England who were most enthusiastic and most helpful about the introduction of the Dalton Plan.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

It was in 1922 that the UK Board of Education gave official approval and many hundreds of schools in England adopted some form of the Dalton Plan. That same year Parkhurst published ''Education on the Dalton Plan''. In time it was claimed that there were a thousand "Dalton" schools in Japan, another thousand in India, and many in the Soviet Union, Poland, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

==Schools==
Today there are a number of schools around the world and that employ variations of teaching methods based on the Dalton Plan. Most of the schools listed below interpret the Dalton Plan according to their needs. In some cases, they retain only a minimal part of the original Dalton Plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Educator|url=https://www.educator.com|publisher=Educator|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Dalton International]]&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the only schools that have strong affiliation with Helen Parkhurst's Dalton School in New York are Dalton Tokyo and Dalton Nagoya.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11705">[[File:EcoCAR final SATURN copy.jpg|thumb|400px|right|An international university competition which challenges teams to lead in the development of advanced automotive technologies]]
'''EcoCAR: The NeXt Challenge''' is a three-year competition that builds on the 19-year history of [[United States Department of Energy|U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)]] [[Advanced Vehicle Technology Competitions (AVTC)|advanced vehicle technology competitions]] by giving engineering students the chance to design and build advanced vehicles that demonstrate leading-edge automotive technologies, with the goal of minimizing the environmental impact of personal transportation and illustrating pathways to a sustainable transportation future. The DOE has again joined [[General Motors|General Motors (GM)]], the [[Government of Canada]] (Transport Canada, Natural Resources Canada), and other sponsors for this new competition series, named the EcoCAR Challenge. [[Argonne National Laboratory]], a DOE research and development facility, will organize and operate the EcoCAR Challenge. Some previous types of advanced vehicle technology competitions include FutureTruck, FutureCar, and [[Challenge X]]. These type of competitions are usually supported by one or more of the [[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)#United States and Canada|Big Three American Automobile Manufacturers]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecocar2.org/ecocarchallenge|title=EcoCAR: The NeXt Challenge|website=www.ecocar2.org|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background on EcoCAR ==
The DOE announced a Notice of Program Interest for North American colleges and universities with accredited engineering programs to compete for the opportunity to participate in EcoCAR: The NeXt Challenge—a new international collegiate vehicle engineering competition—through a request-for-proposal (RFP) process in 2008.

EcoCAR seeks to advance the level of vehicle technology capable of reducing petroleum consumption and [[greenhouse gas]] (GHG) emissions while demonstrating the real-world performance of a range of technology options. Schools interested in receiving an RFP describing in detail the requirements for competing for one of the up to 17 available slots in EcoCAR were invited to express their interest.

== Technology Development ==
The technologies explored in EcoCAR are identical to those being investigated by the automotive industry to meet the demands of improved energy efficiency and dramatic reductions in [[Greenhouse gas]] (GHG)s, as well as to address [[Zero-emissions vehicle|California zero-emissions vehicle (ZEV)]] regulations. These technologies include full-function electric, hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and fuel cell hybrid vehicles. The only fuels approved for use in EcoCAR are [[Common ethanol fuel mixtures|E10 ethanol]], [[E85|E85 ethanol]], [[Biodiesel|B20 biodiesel]], compressed gaseous hydrogen, and the energy carrier electricity.

Teams selected will design and integrate advanced-technology powertrains, lightweight materials, and aerodynamic improvements into a production vehicle. Using this approach, EcoCAR will explore pathways for future vehicles while giving the student participants the knowledge and experience they need to rapidly develop critical engineering skills and become the next generation of leaders in the automotive industry.

EcoCAR is based on a real-world integrated vehicle design and development process. Teams of engineers from the selected schools will develop their vehicles following a modified GM Global Vehicle Development Process (GVDP) for each phase of the three-year competition. By the end of the competition, the sponsors expect fully developed vehicles equivalent to prototypes ready for a production decision. While applying proven methods for engineering successful prototype vehicles, students will learn real-world engineering skills that will make them highly effective in the automotive industry. At the conclusion of each of EcoCAR’s three years, a week-long competition involving all of the participating schools will take place at a GM vehicle proving ground or other appropriate location in [[North America]].

== Participation ==
[[File:Seed Money.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Virginia Tech's Team Leader, Adam Robinson, accepting GM's Seed Money]]
Teams will receive $10,000 in seed money in Year One, a wide range of powertrain components, a vehicle donated by GM, and technical and mentoring support from the competition sponsors. EcoCAR teams will also have a GM mentor knowledgeable in technologies relevant to the team assigned to assist them during the competition. Substantial funds will also be provided to each university to support a full-time graduate student who will provide the team with leadership and continuity over the three-year program.

Schools will be required to match cash seed money donations from EcoCAR sponsors and to provide class credit for students participating in the competition, release time equal to at least one class per semester for a faculty advisor from the engineering school, and logistical and promotional support for their team. Teams may also be asked to match seed money each year to support a full-time, graduate-level engineering team leader. A signed letter of support will be required from the Dean of the Engineering Department with each proposal. If accepted into EcoCAR, each school will be required to sign an annual Good Faith Agreement reaffirming the school's full support of their team and explicitly stating its willingness to participate in all EcoCAR activities with at least one faculty advisor in attendance.

== Outreach ==
[[File:MiddleSchoolOutreach.jpg|thumb|255px|right|Virginia Tech team members Mark Meyer, left, and Graham Burkholder, right, show how their hybrid controller works to interested middle school students.]]
As part of the competition, EcoCAR teams are required to participate in different types of outreach events. These events include things such as press releases, community outreach, K-12 education, etc. Each team is asked to reach out to their communities and get them interested in EcoCAR.

== Year One results ==
In Year One (2009), teams use modeling and simulation to develop their vehicle architecture. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecocar2.org/ecocar-challenge_media|title=EcoCAR Challenge_Media|website=www.ecocar2.org|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecocar2.org/ecocarchallenge/Y1%20Program.pdf|title=Y1 Program.pdf|last=|first=|date=|website=Y1 Program.pdf|publisher=|page=5|access-date=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6444">A '''foundation programme''', '''foundation program''', '''foundation year''', '''foundation year programme''' or '''foundation year program''' is a one-year introductory course to a full multi-year degree curriculum offered by many universities in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] and elsewhere. These programmes may be intended for students not yet in a degree program or may form part of a specific degree course. Some programmes are designed specifically for either domestic or international students.

==United Kingdom==

In the UK, foundation year programmes, also known as "year zero" or "gateway programmes", are designed to develop skills and subject-specific knowledge to ensure a student to advance to a degree course. They may be offered as stand-alone one-year courses or integrated into degree programmes. Some programmes are for students who have not received suitable grades at [[GCE Advanced Level|A Level]] or [[IB Diploma Programme|IB]] while others are aimed at students who did not have the opportunity to take such qualifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ucas.com/undergraduate/what-and-where-study/ucas-undergraduate-what-study|title=UCAS Undergraduate: what to study|at=2.

The '''history of [[school counseling]]''' around the world varies greatly based on how different countries and local communities have chosen to provide academic, career, college readiness, and personal/social skills and competencies to [[K-12]] children and their families based on economic and [[social capital]] resources and public versus private educational settings in what is now called a school counseling program.&lt;ref name=ASCA&gt;{{cite book|author = American School Counselor Association|date = 2005|title = The ASCA National Model: A framework for school counseling programs|location = Alexandria, USA|publisher = Author}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History ==

===Early years===
The first school counselors in the United States emerged in the late 1800s, the time of the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wvde.state.wv.us/counselors/history.html|title=School Counseling: A Brief Historical Overview|last=Schimmel|first=Christine|date=2008|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the United States may not be the first place that school counseling was recognized. There have been traces of school counselors dating back to the late 16th century. An argument has been made that says that counseling and guidance principles began in ancient Greece and Rome with the philosophical teachings of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]. Evidence suggests that techniques of modern-day counseling was practiced by Catholic priests in the Middle Ages. [https://www.academia.edu/22638618/Origin_And_Development_Of_Guidance_And_Counseling_Practice_In_Tanzanian_Schools_1.0._Overview_Track_record_and_Background_of_Advice_and_Counseling_in_general_in_school_Practice_and_other_setting Tomaso Garzoni] wrote a book called “[https://www.academia.edu/22638618/Origin_And_Development_Of_Guidance_And_Counseling_Practice_In_Tanzanian_Schools_1.0._Overview_Track_record_and_Background_of_Advice_and_Counseling_in_general_in_school_Practice_and_other_setting Universal Plaza of all the Professions in the World” (1626)], which was a text about career options. This relates to what a school counselor in high school and college would talk to students about today.

In the United States, the school counseling profession began as a vocational guidance movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wvde.state.wv.us/counselors/history.html|title=School Counseling|website=wvde.state.wv.us|access-date=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ863872 Jesse B. Davis] is considered the first school counselor in the United States because he was the first to implement systematic guidance programs in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pope|first=Mark|title=Jesse Buttrick Davis (1871-1955): Pioneer of Vocational Guidance in the Schools|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ863872|journal=Career Development Quarterly|language=en|volume=57|issue=3|pages=248–258|issn=0889-4019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907, he became the principal of a high school and encouraged the school English teachers to use compositions and lessons to relate career interests, develop character, and avoid behavioral problems. Many others during this time did the same. For example, in 1908, [[Frank Parsons (school counselor)|Frank Parsons]], "Father of Vocational Guidance" established the Bureau of Vocational Guidance to assist young people in making the transition from school to work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.careers.govt.nz/practitioners/career-practice/career-theory-models/parsons-theory/|title=Parsons' theory|website=www.careers.govt.nz|access-date=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1920s to the 1930s, school counseling and guidance grew because of the rise of progressive education in schools. [[National Association for College Admission Counseling]] is founded in 1937. This movement emphasized personal, social, moral development. Many schools reacted to this movement as anti-educational, saying that schools should teach only the fundamentals of education. This, combined with the economic hardship of the [[Great Depression]], led to a decline in school counseling and guidance.

In the 1940s, the U.S. used [[psychologist]]s and counselors to select, recruit, and train military personnel. This propelled the counseling movement in schools by providing ways to test students and meet their needs. Schools accepted these military tests openly. Also, Carl Rogers' emphasis on helping relationships during this time influenced the profession of school counseling.

===1950s and 60s===

In the 1950s the government established the Guidance and Personnel Services Section in the Division of State and Local School Systems. In 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik I. Out of concern that the Russians were beating the U.S. in the space race, which had military implications, and that there were not enough scientists and mathematicians, the American government passed the [[National Defense Education Act]], which spurred a huge growth in vocational guidance through large amounts of funding. Since the 1960s, the profession of school counseling has continued to grow as new legislation and new professional developments were established to refine and further the profession and improve education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Schmidt|first1 = J.J.|date = 2003|title = Counseling in schools: essential services and comprehensive programs|edition = 4th|location = Boston, USA|publisher = Allyn and Bacon}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 1, 2006, congress officially declared February 6–10 as [[National School Counseling Week]].

The 1960s was also a time of great federal funding in the United States for land grant colleges and universities interested in establishing and growing what are now known as Counselor Education programs. School counseling began to shift from a focus exclusively on career development to a focus on student personal and social issues paralleling the rise of social justice and civil rights movements in the United States. It was also in the late 60s and early 1970s that [[Norm Gysbers]] began the work to shift from seeing school counselors as solitary professionals into a more strategic and systemic goal of having a comprehensive developmental school counseling program for all students K-12.&lt;ref name=ASCA/&gt; His and his colleagues' work and research evidence showing strong correlations between fully implemented school counseling programs and student academic success was critical to beginning to show an evidence base for the profession especially at the high school level based on their work in the state of Missouri.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Lapan|first1 = R. T.|last2 = Gysbers|first2 = N. C.|last3 = Sun|first3 = Y|date = 1997|title = The impact of more fully implemented guidance programs on the school experiences of high school students: A statewide evaluation study|journal = Journal of Counseling and Development|volume = 75|pages = 292–302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s and 90s===
But school counseling in the 1980s and early 1990s in the United States was not seen as a player in educational reform efforts buffeting the  educational community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Stone|first1 = C.

In response, Campbell &amp; Dahir (1997) consulted widely with school counselors at the elementary, middle, and high school levels and created the [[ASCA National Standards for School Counseling]] with three core domains (Academic, Career, Personal/Social), nine standards, and specific competencies and indicators for K-12 students.&lt;ref name=ASCA/&gt;

The publication of the ASCA standards in 1997 ushered in a unique period of professionalization and strengthening of school counseling identity, roles, and programs.  A year later, the first systemic [[meta-analysis]] of school counseling was published and gave the profession a wake-up call in terms of the need to focus on outcome research and the small set of methodologically accurate school counseling outcome research studies in academic, career, and personal/social domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Whiston|first1 = S.

===National Center for Transforming School Counseling===

The National Center for Transforming School Counseling (NCTSC) at The Education Trust was founded in 2003. Its foci included (1) changing how school counseling was taught at the graduate level in Counselor Education programs and (2) changing the practices of K-12 school counselors in districts throughout the USA to teach school counselors prevention and intervention skills to help close achievement and opportunity gaps for all students. By 2008, NCTSC consultants had worked in over 100 districts including most major cities.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

In 2008, Rowman Littlefield Education published The New School Counselor: Strategies for Universal Academic Achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Schellenberg|first1 = R.|date = 2008|title = The New School Counselor: Strategies for Universal Academic Achievement|location = Lanham, USA |publisher = Rowman Littlefield Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; The text, written by Rita Schellenberg, a practicing school counselor and counselor educator, describes the new vision for school counseling and guides school counselors and pre-service school counselors through accountable, data-driven programming. Schellenberg introduces Standards Blending, a crosswalking strategy that hold the potential to be culturally sensitive and effective in enhancing academic achievement and closing the achievement gap.&lt;ref name="Schellenberg, R. 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Schellenberg|first1 = R.|last2 =  Grothaus|first2 = T|date = 2009|title = Promoting cultural responsiveness and closing the achievement gap with standards blending|journal = Professional School Counseling|volume = 12|pages = 440–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Schellenberg|first1 = R.|date = 2007|title = Standards blending: Aligning school counseling programs with school academic achievement missions|journal = Virginia Counselors Journal|volume = 29|pages = 13–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent history===

In 2002, the [[American School Counselor Association]] released the ASCA National Model framework for school counseling programs, written by Dr. Trish Hatch and Dr. Judy Bowers, comprising some of the top school counseling components in the field into one model—the work of Norm Gysbers, Curly &amp; Sharon Johnson, Robert Myrick, Dahir &amp; Campbell's ASCA National Standards, and the skill-based focus for closing gaps from the Education Trust's Pat Martin and Reese House into one document. ASCA also developed the RAMP (Recognized ASCA Model Programs) Awards to honor school counseling programs that have fully implemented the ASCA National Model with demonstrable evidence of success for K-12 students (www.schoolcounselor.org).

In 2003, the Center for School Counseling Outcome Research &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = CSCORE|url = http://www.umass.edu/schoolcounseling/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Dimmitt|first1 = C.|last2 = Carey|first2 = J. C.|last3 = Hatch|first3 = T|date = 2007|title = Evidence-based school counseling: Making a difference with data-driven practices|location = Thousand Oaks, USA|publisher = Corwin Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; was developed as a clearinghouse for [[evidence-based practice]] with regular research briefs disseminated and original research projects developed and implemented with founding director Jay Carey. One of the research fellows, Tim Poynton, developed the EZAnalyze software program for all school counselors to use as free-ware to assist in using data-based interventions.

In 2004, the ASCA Code of Ethics was substantially revised to focus on issues of equity, closing gaps, and ensuring all students received access to a K-12 school counseling program.&lt;ref name = schoolcounselor&gt;{{cite web|title = American School Counselor Association|url = http://www.schoolcounselor.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Office for School Counselor Advocacy]] (NOSCA) developed scholarships for research on college counseling by K-12 school counselors and how it is taught in School Counselor Education programs. They also created Advocacy Awards to focus on best practices in college counseling programs in K-12 schools that show effective school counseling practices in creating college-going cultures with demonstrated results in ensuring high rates of college admissions for large percentages of students of nondominant backgrounds.

In 2008, The first NOSCA study was released by Jay Carey and colleagues focusing on innovations in selected College Board "Inspiration Award" schools where school counselors collaborated inside and outside their schools for high college-going rates and strong college-going cultures in schools with large numbers of students of nondominant backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = The College Board|date = 2008|title =  Inspiration &amp; innovation: Ten effective counseling practices from the College Board's Inspiration Award schools|location = Washington, D.C., USA|publisher = Author}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2008, the American School Counselor Association released School Counseling Competencies focused on assisting school counseling programs to effectively implement school counseling programs based on the ASCA Model.&lt;ref name = schoolcounselor/&gt;

The ASCA Model encourages professional school counselors to use crosswalking strategies and to create action plans and results reports that demonstrate "how" school counselors are making a difference in the lives of students.  The most recent version of the ASCA National Model was published in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = American School Counselor Association|url = http://www.ascanationalmodel.org/content.asp?contentid=54|title = The ASCA National Model—New Edition Released|accessdate =  August 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''In Schools We Trust''''' is a book written by [[Deborah Meier]] and published on August 1, 2002. Meier uses her experiences as the founding principal of the [[Mission Hill School]] in Boston, and previous experiences leading the Central Park East schools in New York, to illustrate her vision for school reform in America. The book is broken down into three sections that focus first on the importance of building trust among the various constituencies in schools, then the challenge or threat that high-stakes standardized testing presents to building trust in schools, and finally, a broader vision for how particular systemic and policy changes could be made to increase the likelihood that schools build the trust that is necessary for schools to be effective.

== Summary ==

In the first section, she argues that the main failing of today's public schools is that students do not develop relationships with their teachers. She says that because the school system encourages a separation between a students' school life and their outside life, teachers are missing out on teaching to students' interests. Her main thesis in this section is that teachers need to focus on teaching to students' interests to help engage them in learning which, in turn, will lower drop out rates. Next, she emphasizes the need for parents to be present in their children's schools. She argues that because parents are rarely invited into schools it makes it difficult to place their trust in the school.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Bonnie. "In Schools We Trust: Book Review". Educational Technology &amp; Society, 2002, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Her hope is that if teachers and parents can join together in teaching their child that it will be much more effective. She also recognizes the inherent flaws in the educational system saying "We are-in short-perhaps the only civilization in history that organizes its youth so that the nearer they get to being adults the less and less likely they are to know any adults" &lt;ref&gt;Meier, Deborah. "In Schools We Trust: Creating Communities of Learning in an Era of Testing and Standardization." Beacon, 2002. p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Through her schools she has tried to reverse this trend and allow older students to have more personal relationships with adults and has found that these students are more likely to succeed.

She then moves into a discussion of the history of standardized tests and her experiences with them through her own teaching. She explains that because of the high anxiety that comes with state standardized testing certain ethnic communities are put at a large disadvantage. She states that lower income students are [[setting up to fail|set up to fail]] and thus closes their window of opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Bonnie. "In Schools We Trust: Book Review". Educational Technology &amp; Society, 2002, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; She argues that if the test culture continues, tests will become the only factor of success and inspiration will become vastly undervalued.  The final section is her responding to the criticisms of her ideas and restating her main points. She states that each student is different and each community is different and argues that national and state politicians are not the right people to be designing curriculum. She argues that large public schools can be broken down into many small communities, which will improve overall performance. She also hopes that standardized tests are given less weight in the future since, she believes, they do not give a complete picture of each student. She closes with an answer to her main question: "For me the most important answer to the question 'why save public education?' is this: It is in schools that we learn the art of living together as citizens, and it is in public schools that we are obliged to defend the idea of a public, not only a private, interest." &lt;ref&gt;Meier, Deborah. In Schools We Trust: Creating Communities of Learning in an Era of Testing and Standardization." Beacon, 2002. p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

This book has been celebrated in the education community since its release in 2002. In one review, Bonnie Brown states that [[Deborah Meier]] is "a legendary school founder and reformer" &lt;ref&gt;Brown, Bonnie. "In Schools We Trust: Book Review". Educational Technology &amp; Society, 2002, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; and states that this book is "a well-written book that acknowledges the trouble and turmoil our public schools are facing with standardized testing" &lt;ref&gt;Brown, Bonnie. "In Schools We Trust: Book Review". Educational Technology &amp; Society, 2002, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Brown continues to praise the book and even argues that "If other educators read this beautifully written book with an open mind, and put her concepts into practice, it can possibly revolutionize the current state of our public school system." &lt;ref&gt;Brown, Bonnie. "In Schools We Trust: Book Review". Educational Technology &amp; Society, 2002, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In another review, Milly Marmur writes that she sees the book making a strong impact. She believes it has ideas that are useful to the wider educational community and may even be able to influence the political community to create the change she hopes for.&lt;ref&gt;Marmur, Milly. "In Schools We Trust." Publishers Weekly, 2002, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Nicholas Meier also reviewed this book in April 2005 and was also impressed with the issues that were discussed. Overall, he feels that "Meier's writing style is engaging" &lt;ref&gt;Meier, Nicholas. "In Schools We Trust Review". 2005, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; and states that throughout the book she presents the deepest and most profound questions that the American school system faces and presents reasonable solutions that have been shown to succeed. He also links to other authors that have praised this book, such as [[Jonathan Kozol]], [[Mike Rose (educator)]], [[Publishers Weekly]] and [[Ted Sizer]].

The number of Indian students studying abroad rapidly increased by 163% between 1999 and 2006 to reach 145,539 as compared to slower growth of 25% between 2006 and 2013 to reach 181,872, according an analysis of UNESCO data. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Choudaha|first=Rahul|date=March 2017|title=Three waves of international student mobility (1999-2020)|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4RmnCsexL7ZckFpR1FXVFFQZ2M/view|journal=Studies in Higher Education|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1080/03075079.2017.1293872|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Students of Indian origin are [[Student migration|traveling]] in higher numbers than ever before to pursue [[higher education]] abroad. Nearly 85% of internationally mobile Indian students head for five countries—the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and New Zealand{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}—but China and Germany are both emerging destinations for Indian students heading abroad, though the numbers heading for Germany are still relatively small. In 2006, of the 123,000 studying outside India, 76,500 chose the US, followed by the UK; in 2001 India overtook China as the source of the largest number of foreign students in the United States.

German universities have started offering several master's programs in English, attracting Indian students.

==Other major destinations==
Nearly 85% of internationally mobile Indian students head for five countries: the US, UK, Australia, Canada and New Zealand, but in addition to Germany, China, Ukraine, Russia and Georgia are some emerging destination for Indian students heading abroad.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Romania and Ukraine has also emerged as a destination for Indian students of medicine as the education system is regulated under the [[European Union]] and is of a higher quality than in the countries of the former USSR quality is relatively better compared to Ex-USSR, China, and the Philippines.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Many Indian students are also opting for higher education in the Netherlands because of the high quality of education, availability of more than 2,000 courses taught completely in English, and access to the European Union including career opportunities after graduation.&lt;ref&gt;B.

==Background==

John Lawrence Childs was born in [[Eau Claire, Wisconsin]].  He graduated from the University of Wisconsin at Madison with a Journalism degree in 1911.  He also began working with the [[Young Men's Christian Association]] (YMCA) then.

==Career==

From 1912 to 1915, Childs headed the YMCA's Midwest chapter in [[Kankakee, Illinois]].  In 1916, he worked in [[Peking, China]] as a YMCA missionary.  John Dewey stayed at Childs' home during his own visit to China. In 1922, Childs returned to the U.S..  In 1923, he began graduate studies at [[Union Theological Seminary (New York City)|Union Theological Seminary]] (UTC): one of his professors at the Teachers College was [[W. H. Kilpatrick]].  In 1924, he went back to China.  In 1927, he returned to States to study for a doctorate.

In 1931, Dr. Childs joined the faculty of Teachers College.  In 1935, he became associate professor and, in 1938. 

In 1935, Childs also joined the [[American Federation of Teachers]] (AFT) but in 1937 resigned due to rise in Communist influence.  (His departure followed election of [[Jerome Davis (sociologist)|Jerome Davis]], a colleague at UTC and in the YMCA.) 

In 1944, he was elected state chair of the [[Liberal Party of New York]].  On January 5, 1947, he resigned to give more time to his job as director of education at Columbia's Teachers College.  At the time of his resignation, the Liberal Party of New York was expected to become the political agency of [[Americans for Democratic Action]], whose formation was announced days before Child's resignation.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children''' (KABC) is a clinical instrument (psychological [[diagnostic test]]) for assessing cognitive development. Its construction incorporates several recent developments in both psychological theory and statistical methodology. The test was developed by [[Alan S. Kaufman]] and [[Nadeen L. Kaufman]] in 1983 and revised in 2004. The test has been translated and adopted for many countries, such as the Japanese version of the K-ABC by the Japanese psychologists Tatsuya Matsubara, Kazuhiro Fujita, Hisao Maekawa, and [[Toshinori Ishikuma]].

The KABC also gives special attention to certain emerging testing needs, such as use with [[handicapped]] groups, application to problems of [[learning disabilities]], and appropriateness for [[cultural]] and [[natural language|linguistic]] [[minorities]]. The authors rightly caution, however, that success in meeting these special needs must be judged through practical use over time. They also point out that the KABC should not be regarded as "the complete test battery"; like any other test, it should be supplemented and corroborated by other instruments to meet individual needs, such as the [[Stanford-Binet]], [[Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale]], [[Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children]], [[McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities (MSCA)|McCarthy scales]], or [[neuropsychological test]]s.

==History==

The original KABC was developed from [[Neuropsychology|neuropsychological theory]], merging left brain-right brain research on cerebral specialisation (e.g., Sperry, 1968) with Luria’s sequential simultaneous processing dichotomy (Luria, 1966) and work in cognitive psychology. The KABC  focuses on the processes needed to solve problems rather than their content i.e. verbal vs. non verbal. The KABC was one of the first intelligence tests to be principally derived from strong theoretical basis and the first intelligence test to be based in neuropsychological theory (Reynolds &amp; Kamphaus, 1997). An important feature of the KABC is that it yielded smaller than average score differences than was typical between African American and European American ethnic groups, making it particularly useful when assessing children of difference ethnicities.

The second edition (KABC-II) which was published in 2004, is an individually administered measure of the processing and cognitive abilities of children and adolescents aged 3–18. As with the original KABC, the KABC-II is a theory-based instrument. However the KABC-II differs in its conceptual framework and test structure. While the KABC is grounded in simultaneous/sequential processing approach the KABC-II incorporates two distinct theoretical models. The KABC-II is grounded in a dual theoretical foundation: the [[Cattell–Horn–Carroll theory|Cattell-Horn-Carroll]] (CHC) psychometric model of broad and narrow abilities and [[Alexander Luria|Luria]]’s neuropsychological theory of processing.

There are a number of important revisions in the KABC-II:

* The age range has been widened, additional scales developed and the theoretical foundation expanded.
* Eight of the original 16 subtests can be found in the KABC-II and 10 new subtests have been introduced.
* Four subtests have been removed from the measurement of Simultaneous processing: Magic Window, Spatial Memory, Photo Series and Matrix Analogies.
* Three have been retained: Triangles, Face Recognition and Gestalt Closure and three new ones have been added: Conceptual Thinking, Block Counting and Rover.
* The Learning Ability scale is new as is the Planning Scale. The Knowledge scale is made up of two original subtests (Expressive Vocabulary and Riddles) and a new addition Verbal Knowledge.

With the KABC-II, the examiner can choose which theoretical model to follow. Typically the Cattell-Horn-Carroll model is useful for children from a mainstream cultural and language background. Or if Crystallized Ability would not be a fair indicator of the child’s cognitive ability, examiners may choose the Luria model which excludes verbal ability.

==Test format==
The KABC-II has 18 subtests of two types: core and supplementary. Before testing the examiner decides which model to follow: Luria or CHC.  The subtests are grouped into 4 or 5 scales depended on the age and interpretive model chosen. Luria’s model consists of four scales: Sequential Processing Scale, Simultaneous processing Scale, Learning Ability and Planning Ability. CHC model renames these: Short Term Memory (Gsm), Visual Processing (Gv), Long Term Storage and Retrieval (Glr) and Fluid Reasoning (Gf) plus an additional 5th scale Crystallised Ability (Gc).

KABC-II scales and their subtests include:

'''Simultaneous/Gv'''

* Triangles: the child assembles several foam triangles to match a picture.
* Face Recognition: the child looks a photographs of one or two faces for 5 seconds and then selects the correct face/faces shown in a difference pose from a selection.
* Block Counting: The child counts the number of blocks in a picture of a stack of blocks, some of the blocks are partially hidden.
* Conceptual Thinking: The child selects one picture from a set of 4 or 5 which does not belong with the set.
* Rover: The child moves a toy dog to a bone on a grid that contains several obstacles trying to find the quickest path to the bone.
* Gestalt Closure: The child mentally fills in the gaps in a partially completed inkblot drawing and names or describes the object/action depicted in the drawing.
* Pattern Reasoning (ages 5 and 6).
* Story Completion (ages 5 and 6).

'''Sequential/Gsm'''

* Word Order: The assessor reads the names of common objects, the child the touches a series of silhouettes of these objects in the same order they were read out in.
* Number Recall: The assessor reads a string of numbers and the child repeats the string in the same order. The strings range from 2 to 9 digits.
* Hand Movements: the child copies a series of taps the examiner makes on the table with the fist, palm or side of the hand.

'''Planning/Gf'''

* Pattern Reasoning (ages 7–18): the child is shown a series of stimulus that form a logical linear pattern with one stimulus missing. The child selects the missing stimulus from several options.
* Story Completion (ages 7–18): the child is shown a row of pictures that tell a story, some pictures are missing. The child selects several pictures from a selection that are needed to complete the story and places them in the correct location.

'''Learning/Glr'''

* Atlantis: the assessor teaches the child nonsense names for pictures of fish, shells and plants. The child then has to point to the correct picture when read out the nonsense name.
* Atlantis Delayed: the child repeats the Atlantis subtest 15–25 minutes later to demonstrate delayed recall.
* Rebus: the assessor teaches the child the word or concept associated with a rebus (drawing) and the child reads aloud phrases and sentences composed of these rebuses.
* Rebus Delayed: the child repeats the Rebus subtest 15–25 minutes later to demonstrate delayed recall of paired associates.

'''Knowledge(Gc) included in the CHC model only

* Riddles: the examiner says several characteristics of a concrete or abstract verbal concept, and the child has to point to it or name it.
* Expressive Vocabulary: measures the Childs ability to say the correct names of objects and illustrations.
* Verbal Knowledge: the child selects from an array for 6 pictures the one that corresponds to a vocabulary word or answers a general information question.

KABC-II yields two general intelligence composite scores: Mental Processing Index (MPI; Luria’s model) and Fluid-Crystallised Index (FCI; CHC model). The Luria model takes 25–60 minutes to administer while the CHC model takes 30–75 minutes to administer depending on the child’s age.

==Psychometric properties==
The KABC-II was standardised between 2001 and 2003 on 3,025 3- to 18-year-olds in 39 states and the District of Columbia. The KABC-II is co normed with the [[Alan S. Kaufman#Overview_of_Kaufman.27s_tests|KTEA-II]] (Kaufman &amp; Kaufman, 2004b). Correlation studies have been completed with: KABC, [[Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children|WISC]], WISC-III, [[WPPSI]]-III, [[KAIT]], WJ-III COG, [[PIAT]]-R, WJ-III ACH and [[WIAT]]-II. Special group studies (clinical validity studies) included: those with Emotional Disturbances, [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]], [[Autism|Autistic Disorder]], [[Intellectual disability]], Learning Disability (Written expression, Mathematics and Reading) and those classed as Gifted.

The internal consistency reliability coefficient for core and supplementary subtests demonstrate the KABC-II has good reliability. The median reliability for the 3-6 age band is .85 (range .69-.92) and .87 (range .74-.93) for 7-18. Retest reliabilities of the global scales ranged from 0.72 to 0.94 where retest stability increasing with age.

==Uses==
The KABC-II helps to identify an individual’s strengths and weaknesses in cognitive ability and mental processing. The information proved by the KABC-II can facilitate clinical and educational planning, treatment planning and placement decisions. As with most psychological assessments the utility can be improved when combined with other tools.

==Translations==
The approach to understanding intelligence with the most supported and published research over the longest period of time is based on psychometric testing. It is also by far the most widely used in practical settings. Intelligence quotient (IQ) tests include the Stanford-Binet, Raven's Progressive Matrices, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale and the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children. There are also psychometric tests that are not intended to measure intelligence itself but some closely related construct such as scholastic aptitude. In the United States examples include the SSAT, the SAT, the ACT, the GRE, the MCAT, the LSAT, and the GMAT.[1]
Intelligence tests are widely used in educational,[18] business, and military settings because of their efficacy in predicting behavior. IQ and g (discussed in the next section) are correlated with many important social outcomes—individuals with low IQs are more likely to be divorced, have a child out of marriage, be incarcerated, and need long-term welfare support, while individuals with high IQs are associated with more years of education, higher status jobs and higher income.[19] Intelligence is significantly correlated with successful training and performance outcomes, and IQ/g is the single best predictor of successful job performance.[1][20]

The '''Keller Plan''', also called the '''Personalized System of Instruction''' (PSI), was developed by [[Fred S. Keller]] with J. Gilmour Sherman, Carolina Bori, and Rodolpho Azzi in the middle 1960s as an innovative method of instruction for the then-new [[University of Brasília]]&lt;ref&gt;Keller, F. S. (1967). Engineering personalized instruction in the classroom. Revista Interamericana de Psicologia/Interamerican Journal of Psychology, 1(3).&lt;/ref&gt;. PSI was conceived of as an application of [[B. F. Skinner|Skinner]]'s theories of learning, grounded in [[operant conditioning]] strategies of [[behaviorism]].

==Principles==
Keller argued that effective instruction should incorporate five principles, the essential elements of the Keller Plan:&lt;ref&gt;Keller, F. S. (1968). Goodbye teacher… Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis 1, 79-89&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1007&amp;context=physicspsikeller&lt;/ref&gt;

* Written materials—The primary presentation of new content should be through written texts.  Given the forms of media available at the time when the Keller Plan was developed (e.g., lectures, movies, audio records, television, radio, paper-based text, etc.), paper-based texts gave students the greatest freedom; books and texts are portable, can be read at one's own pace, can be started and stopped at any time, can be easily reviewed, and can be marked by the reader.  As an application of [[behaviorism]], the Keller Plan was meant to maximize the number of operant behaviors that could be reinforced; this could best be done with written materials rather than have the learner be a passive observer of other media.  [[Digital media]] available today could provide the same kinds of learner control and presumably could be incorporated in a contemporary implementation of PSI.
* Units of content—Subject matter material should be broken down into separable, meaningful units. These units could have various kinds of relationships; for example, one could provide prerequisites for understanding a second, or the second could provide deeper elaboration of a proceeding unit.  In any case, specific learning objectives should be definable for each discrete unit of content.
* Self-paced instruction—Students should be allowed to advance through the course material at their own pace.  While an instructor might specify the order in which learning units are completed, the learners should decide when and at what rate they learn.  Learners could move through a course as quickly or slowly as they choose.
* Unit mastery—Students must satisfy a mastery requirement in one unit before proceeding to the next.  Typically, a unit in PSI would have more than one equivalent form of assessment—for example, three quizzes of equal difficulty or three primary sources or data sets to be analyzed.  Students must demonstrate mastery of a unit's objectives to a certain level of quality.  If the student does not reach the threshold, they are redirected to unit materials (or supplements if provided) and then take an equivalent form of the unit assessment.  From the point of view of behaviorism, demonstrating mastery and being allowed to continue to a subsequent unit was presumed to be reinforcing
* Proctors—Human [[proctor#Education|proctors]] are an important part of the Keller Plan.  The proctors could be "external" to the course (adults or peers brought to the course from external sources) or "internal" (advanced students in the course who are doing well, have completed all units to date, and have good interpersonal skills).  Proctors were the arbiters of unit mastery; they would "certify" mastery, discuss areas of weakness, and direct students to the next units.  Behaviorists were always concerned about bringing conditioned behaviors under the control of "natural" reinforcers; interactions with the proctors were presumed to provide natural social reinforcers that encouraged learning behaviors and perseverance in the course.

While traditional teaching is "same pace, different learning", a key distinguishing factor of PSI is that it instead advocates "different pace, same learning". A traditional course might have all students follow the same weekly lectures, exercises, etc., and then sit an end-of-course exam at the same date — but possibly with huge variation in learning outcomes (e.g., 95% achievement for a strong student, but just 55% for a weak one). In a course run according to PSI, all students must pass a high threshold of achievement on each module within the course (for instance 90%). The difference between weak and strong students would then be that the stronger ones be able to finish the course quicker, while the weaker ones would need more time.&lt;ref name = buskist91&gt;Buskist, W., Cush, D., &amp; DeGrandpre, R.

The Keller Plan has mainly been used in [[higher education]], particularly as a more personalized form of instruction in large classes, but there is nothing inherent in Keller's formulation to restrict its application to particular grade levels, content, or types of courses&lt;ref name=buskist91 /&gt;; for instance the papers &lt;ref&gt;Klishis, M. J., Hursh, D. C., &amp; Klishis, L. A. (1980). Individualized spelling: An application and evaluation of PSI in the elementary school. Journal of Personalized Instruction, 4, 148-156.&lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;ref&gt;Callahan, C., &amp; Smith, R. M. (1990). Keller's personalized system of instruction in a junior high gifted program. Roeper Review, 13(1), 39-44.&lt;/ref&gt; report on usage in elementary school and junior high school, respectively. There has been a good deal of research on the effectiveness of PSI which indicated that it had robust, significantly positive effects on learning when compared to more traditional lecture-based formats.&lt;ref&gt;Kulik, J. A., Kulik, C. L. C., &amp; Cohen, P. A. (1979). A meta-analysis of outcome studies of Keller's personalized system of instruction. American Psychologist, 34(4), 307.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ironsmith, M., &amp; Eppler, M. A. (2007). Faculty forum: Mastery learning benefits low-aptitude students. Teaching of Psychology, 34(1), 28-31.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in some cases, self-pacing was also seen to have problems with student withdrawal and procrastination &lt;ref&gt;Reiser, R. A., &amp; Sullivan, H. J. (1977). Effects of self-pacing and instructor-pacing in a PSI course. The Journal of Educational Research, 71(1), 8-12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Semb, G., Glick, D. M., &amp; Spencer, R. E. (1979). Student withdrawals and delayed work patterns in self-paced psychology courses. Teaching of psychology, 6(1), 23-25.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In spite of much documented success, PSI has not taken off massively. Education is still dominated by "same pace, different learning" approaches, and the number of new research publications about PSI gradually declined after its heyday in the 70's&lt;ref name=buskist91 /&gt;. Several possible reasons are given for this, not the least that PSI represented a too radical deviation from established teaching practices and educational management routines &lt;ref name=buskist91 /&gt;&lt;ref name=sherman92&gt;Sherman, J. G. (1992). Reflections on PSI: Good news and bad. Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis, 25(1), 59-64.&lt;/ref&gt;. Other explanations include conflicts within the PSI movement&lt;ref name=sherman92 /&gt; and the challenge that PSI demands more teaching effort&lt;ref&gt;Grant, L. K., &amp; Spencer, R. E. (2003). The personalized system of instruction: Review and applications to distance education. The International Review of Research in Open and Distributed Learning, 4(2).&lt;/ref&gt;. However, it has been speculated that PSI might see a revival with modern educational technology, as information technology could gradually alleviate teacher burdens related to frequent testing and feedback, as well as mitigate the increased administrative complexity that courses with student self-pacing have over those with instructor-set pace.&lt;ref&gt;Eyre, H. L. (2007). Keller's Personalized System of Instruction: Was it a Fleeting Fancy or is there a Revival on the Horizon?. The Behavior Analyst Today, 8(3), 317.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9934">The '''Laura Spence Affair''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] political controversy in 2000, ignited after the failure of high-flying [[state school]] pupil Laura Spence to secure a place at the [[University of Oxford]].

==Background==
Laura Spence was a pupil at [[Monkseaton High School|Monkseaton Community High School]], a state school in [[Whitley Bay]], [[North Tyneside]].  In 1999, she applied for a place to [[Medical education in the United Kingdom|read medicine]] at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]] (there were one hundred students in her school year, but she was the only one to apply for a university place at "[[Oxbridge]]").  Spence had taken ten [[GCSE]]s, obtaining the top A* grade in each, and had been predicted (and later achieved) top [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-level]] grades in Chemistry, Biology, English and Geography.&lt;ref name="war"&gt;[http://education.guardian.co.uk/oxbridge/article/0,,326388,00.html The war of Laura's rejection], ''[[The Observer]]'', 28 May 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="truth"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/883358.stm Laura's moment of truth], [[BBC News]], 17 August 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  Spence was interviewed by [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College]] but she was not offered a place because &amp;mdash; according to the college &amp;mdash; other candidates, of whom there were 22 for 5 positions, had equally good qualifications and had performed better at interview. The reason given for Spence's [[Oxbridge reject|rejection]] was, as one BBC report put it, that she "did not show potential".&lt;ref name="Harvard"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/759114.stm Oxford 'reject' wins Harvard scholarship], [[BBC News]], 22 May 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The same report said that Spence was one of ten British students to be awarded a $65,000 [[scholarship]] by [[Harvard University]], where she later on studied [[biochemistry]].&lt;ref name="Harvard"/&gt; However, Harvard does not award scholarships to attract individual students; it admits students on a [[need-blind]] basis and then, separately, awards financial aid based solely on familial need.&lt;ref name="financial aid"&gt;[https://college.harvard.edu/financial-aid/applying-aid/prospective-students Financial Aid for Prospective Students], Harvard University website, accessed 15 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political row==
A political row broke out after [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] and then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Gordon Brown]] (who later became [[Prime Minister]]) commented on the decision at a [[Trades Union Congress]] reception. Brown accused Oxford of [[elitism]], saying that Spence's rejection was an 'absolute scandal' and that he believed she had been discriminated against by 'an old establishment interview system'.  Spence's headteacher, Dr Paul Kelley, also said he believed Oxford was 'missing out' and that he thought that Spence had been rejected because of her being from the north east of England. The University of Oxford rebutted all allegations of discrimination. The BBC reported that [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College]] had offered only five places to study medicine but had received twenty-two applicants, and that Oxford received a similar number of applications from state schools and private schools in the north east of England, and accepted a similar proportion from each.&lt;ref name="Harvard"/&gt; The admissions tutor at Magdalen, Andrew Hobson, also denied the claims, pointing out that he was from [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]].&lt;ref name = "telegraph"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml;jsessionid=05J53B0LJY4AXQFIQMFCFFWAVCBQYIV0?html=/archive/2000/05/23/nharv23.html State school applicants to Oxford drop to 54pc], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 28 October 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Colin Lucas|Dr Colin Lucas]], [[Vice-Chancellor]] of Oxford, said that Brown's remarks were "disappointing", and an unnamed Conservative spokesman reportedly told the BBC: "This is ignorant prejudice. Why doesn't Gordon Brown get on with delivering at least some of the things Labour were elected on, rather than telling universities which candidates they should pick for which courses, when he can't possibly know the full facts."&lt;ref name="attack"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/764141.stm Chancellor attacks Oxford admissions], [[BBC News]], 26 May 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ensuing debate, those who disagreed with the Chancellor advanced a range of arguments: some believed there was no discrimination; some felt Brown did not have his facts straight and therefore should not have offered a public opinion; and some believed that Oxford was correct in not offering Laura Spence a place.  When the issue was raised at an Oxford edition of the [[BBC|BBC's]] political discussion show ''[[Question Time (TV series)|Question Time]]'' in October 2000, Professor [[Robert Winston]] said that Spence did not deserve a place, because "you have to be committed to the course, and Laura Spence clearly wasn't committed because she didn't even end up studying medicine."&lt;ref name="winston"&gt;[http://www.oxfordstudent.com/mt2000wk3/News/oxford_in_question Oxford In Question] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927023002/http://www.oxfordstudent.com/mt2000wk3/News/oxford_in_question |date=2007-09-27 }}, [[The Oxford Student]], 26 October 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; (Harvard, along with most other universities in the USA, does not [[Medical school in the United States|offer medicine]] as an [[Undergraduate education#American system|undergraduate degree]]: Spence later went on to study Medicine at Cambridge as a [[postgraduate]]&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/she-could-get-a-place-to-study-at-oxford-or-cambridge-so-why-is-dominique-off-to-harvard-instead-506412.html She could get a place to study at Oxford or Cambridge. So why is Dominique off to Harvard instead?], ''[[The Independent]]'', 11 September 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;).

Spence herself did not get involved in the arguments, subsequently saying that she tried to ignore the row by focusing on revision and not watching television for a week.&lt;ref name="right"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/1443063.stm Oxford was right, says Laura], [[BBC News]], 17 July 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[House of Lords]] debate on [[Universities in the United Kingdom|Higher Education]] on 15 June 2000, [[Roy Jenkins|Lord Jenkins of Hillhead]], a [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] [[peerage|peer]] and then [[Chancellor]] of Oxford University, criticised Brown for his comments on student admissions, saying that "nearly every fact he used was false", and that Brown's speech on Spence had been a "little Blitzkrieg in being an act of sudden unprovoked aggression", but "The target was singularly ill-chosen."  [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] peer [[Janet Young, Baroness Young|Baroness Young]] stated that it was "an ultimate disgrace to use a young girl, a sixth former, in this way".&lt;ref name="peers"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/792021.stm Peers condemn Oxford attack], [[BBC News]], 15 June 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

==After the row==
The Laura Spence Affair recurred in the headlines in the UK throughout the summer of 2000 (both before &lt;ref&gt;[http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/story/0,,255380,00.html Oxford blues], [[The Guardian]], May 24, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; and after Brown's speech), and is arguably one of the major events that pushed [[widening participation|"widening participation" in Higher Education]] into the political spotlight in the United Kingdom. It also caused a party political row over a [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|select committee]] report on [[higher education]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/1159267.stm Row over university report], [[BBC News]], 8 February 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spence completed her studies at Harvard in 2004, and planned to return to the UK to pursue a medical career.  She also encouraged more British students to study in the US, citing the "broader, more balanced curriculum" of a [[liberal arts]] education and the availability of scholarships and need-based financial aid to assist with fees that may seem "astronomically prohibitive".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/3537724.stm Laura Spence urges students to US], [[BBC News]], 5 August 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was later reported that she was studying medicine at the [[University of Cambridge]].&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt;

In 2007 ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' revisited the affair, comprehensively reviewing the political statements at the time set against the facts of the case, and subsequent political and educational fall-out. It was highly critical of Gordon Brown's "spectacular own goal".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/education/article2060831.ece "University Challenge"], Godfrey Smith, [[The Sunday Times]] (London), July 15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On Saturday 25 October 2008, Spence graduated from [[Wolfson College, Cambridge]], with a degree in Medicine. Cambridge said she graduated from her medicine course with distinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1080686/Former-comprehensive-girl-centre-Oxford-elitism-row-graduates-Cambridge.html |title=Former comprehensive girl at centre of Oxford elitism row graduates from Cambridge &amp;#124; Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2008-10-26 |accessdate=2010-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6269">[[Image:Pisa.Baptistery.lectern.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Marble lectern in the [[Pisa Baptistery]], Italy]]
A '''lectern''' (from the Latin ''lectus'', past participle of ''legere'', "to read") is a reading desk, with a slanted top, usually placed on a stand or affixed to some other form of support, on which documents or books are placed as support for reading aloud, as in a [[scripture]] reading, [[lecture]], or [[sermon]]. To facilitate eye-contact and improve posture when facing an audience, lecterns may have adjustable height and slant. People generally use lecterns while standing.

In pre-modern usage, the word lectern was used to refer specifically to the "reading desk or stand ... from which the Scripture lessons (''lectiones'') ... are chanted or read."&lt;ref&gt;Lectern, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pAwbAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA71 ''Chambers's Cyclopaedia'', Vol. VI] W. and R. Chambers, 1864; pp. 71-72.&lt;/ref&gt; One 1905 dictionary states that "the term is properly applied only to the class mentioned [church book stands] as independent of the [[pulpit]]."&lt;ref&gt;D. C. Gilman, H. T. Peck and F. M. Colby (eds), Lectern, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rYpRAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA68 ''The New International Cyclopaedia'', Vol. XII], Dodd, Mead and Co., 1905; p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1920s, however, the term was being used in a broader sense, for example, in reference to a memorial service in [[Carnegie Hall]], it was stated that "the lectern from which the speakers talked was enveloped in black."&lt;ref&gt;Domestic News: New York, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rIflAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA181 ''The Reform Advocate'', Vol LV], No. 7, September 18, 1920; p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lecterns used in academia—generally in seminar rooms and lecture theatres—may have certain features that common lecterns lack, based on the technological sophistication of the venue. These features usually include a microphone stand, audio-visual controls, sometimes even an integrated computer and recording system. Lecterns of this sort are generally attached or integrated into a large desk, as the amount of support material tends to be larger in academic contexts than in straightforward public talks.

=== Religious context ===
[[File:Adlerpult mit Fledermaus.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.50|Eagle lectern in the choir hall of [[Aachen cathedral]] with a [[bat]] cast in 1874 in [[Stolberg (Rhineland)|Stolberg]]. The bat on the eagle's back serves to stabilize the damaged lectern.]]

==== Christian ====
In the [[Christian Church]], the lectern is usually the stand on which the [[Bible]] rests and from which the "lessons" (reading from Scripture) are read during the service. The lessons may be read or chanted by a priest, deacon, minister, or layperson, depending upon the liturgical traditions of the community. The lectern is normally set in front of the pews, so that the reader or speaker faces the congregation.

Lecterns are often made of wood. They may be either fixed in place or portable. A lectern differs from a [[pulpit]], the latter being used for [[sermon]]s. Churches that have both a lectern and a pulpit will often place them on opposite sides. The lectern will generally be smaller than the pulpit, and both may be adorned with [[antipendia]] in the color of the [[liturgical year|liturgical season]].

In monastic churches and cathedrals, a separate lectern is commonly set in the centre of the [[choir (architecture)|choir]]. Originally this would have carried the [[antiphonal]] book, for use by the [[cantor (church)|cantor]] or [[precentor]] leading the singing of the [[Canonical hours|divine office]]. Lecterns are often eagle-shaped to symbolise [[John the Apostle]].&lt;ref&gt;''How to read a church'', Richard Taylor, London 2003, {{ISBN|1-84413-053-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Ferguson, ''Signs and Symbols in Christian Art'', New York 1966&lt;/ref&gt; Especially in North America and Great Britain lecterns are sometimes made as 'angel lecterns'.

==== Jewish ====

Because the [[Torah scroll]]s are generally large, the central feature of the [[Bema#Judaism|bimah]] in a [[synagogue]] is a table large enough to hold an open Torah along with a [[Tikkun (book)|tikkun]] or [[Chumash (Judaism)|Chumash]] (reference books used to check the reading). In some synagogues, this table may resemble a large lectern.

In traditional [[yeshiva]]s and some synagogues, students and members of the congregation may use small desks called ''shtenders'' ({{lang-yi|שטענדער}}). These closely resemble conventional lecterns, and indeed, one shtender may be used as a lectern by the [[Hazzan]] leading the service. Note however that each study group in a yeshivah may have its own shtender and in some older synagogues, individual members of the congregation may have their own shtenders.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel C. Heilman, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=kl_63a6NGXsC&amp;pg=PA3 The People of the Book]'', University of Chicago Press, 1983, Transaction Publishers, 2009; see Chapter 1, page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hanoch Teller, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=zvS2lbrTjjQC&amp;pg=PA169 Sunset]'', Feldheim Publishers, 1987; page 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional shtenders frequently incorporate a locker under the desktop where prayerbooks and study material may be locked when not in use, and many feature a footrest for comfort during extended study sessions or standing prayers. Some older synagogues have large collections of shtenders.

'''Lifewide learning''' ('''LWL''') is a [[teaching strategy]] and an approach to learning and personal development that involves real contexts and authentic settings. The goal is to address different kinds of learning not covered in a [[traditional classroom]]. By including LWL with a traditional classroom, students are better equipped to attain [[whole person development]] and to develop the [[lifelong learning]] skills.&lt;ref name="NAME"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.edb.gov.hk/index.aspx?nodeID=3110&amp;langno=1 | title=EDB Life-wide Learning | accessdate=2008-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the focus of education in Hong Kong and was developed for higher education at the University of Surrey England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Learning for a Complex World: A lifewide concept of learning, education and personal development|last=Jackson|first=Norman Jeffrey|publisher=Authorhouse|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4567-9370-8|location=United States of America|pages=347}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lifewide education]] is the means by which an institution encourages, supports and recognizes learners' lifewide learning. It is an approach to visualising learning and personal development as a whole of life enterprise.

Lifewide learning adds important detail to the broad pattern of human development we call lifelong learning – all the learning and development one gains as one progresses along the pathway of one's life. Lifewide learning recognizes that most people, no matter what their age or circumstances, simultaneously inhabit a number of different spaces – like work or education, being a member of a family, being involved in clubs or societies, traveling, taking holidays, and looking after their own well-being mentally, physically, and spiritually. So the timeframes of lifelong learning and the spaces of life-wide learning will characteristically intermingle, and who we are and who we are becoming are the consequences of this intermingling.

Most people have the freedom to choose which spaces they want to occupy and how they want to occupy them. In these spaces, they  make decisions about what to be involved in, meet and interact with different people, have different sorts of relationships, adopt different roles and identities, and think, behave and communicate in different ways. In these different spaces, they encounter different sorts of challenges and problems, seize, create or miss opportunities, and aspire to live and achieve their ambitions. The promise of lifewide education is that people can more fully appreciate and value their lives for the potential they hold for enabling them to become the people they want and need to become (in other words, their everyday pathway to [[self-actualization|actualising]] themselves).

[http://www.lifewideeducation.uk/ 'Lifewide Education'] a not for profit, community-based organisation was founded in 2011 to encourage and support the growth and exchange of knowledge and practices in educational settings relating to lifewide learning. Its programme of scholarly work explores the many dimensions of lifewide learning.

'''Mentorship''' is a relationship in which a more experienced or more knowledgeable person helps to guide a less experienced or less knowledgeable person. The [[mentor]] may be older or younger than the person being mentored, but he or she must have a certain area of expertise.&lt;ref name="MasteryWorks"/&gt; It is a learning and development partnership between someone with vast experience and someone who wants to learn.&lt;ref name="MasteryWorks"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Farren Ph.D.|first1=Caela|title=Eight Types of Mentor: Which Ones Do You Need?|url=http://www.masteryworks.com/newsite/downloads/Article3_EightTypesofMentors-WhichOnesdoyouNeed.pdf|publisher=MasteryWorks}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mentorship experience and relationship structure affect the "amount of psychosocial support, career guidance, role modeling, and communication that occurs in the mentoring relationships in which the protégés and mentors engaged."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fagenson-Eland | first1 = Ellen A. | last2 = Marks | first2 = Michelle A. | last3 = Amendola | first3 = Karen L. | year = 1997 | title = Perceptions of mentoring relationships | url = | journal = Journal of Vocational Behavior | volume = 51 | issue = 1| pages = 29–42 | doi=10.1006/jvbe.1997.1592}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The person in receipt of mentorship may be referred to as a '''''protégé''''' (male), a '''''protégée''''' (female), an [[Apprenticeship|apprentice]] or, in the 2000s, a '''mentee'''.

[[File:Age Teaching Youth.jpg|thumb|right|200px|William Blake's watercolor of "Age teaching youth", a Romantic representation of mentorship. Blake represented this type of relationship in many of his works, including the illustrations of his ''[[Songs of Innocence]]''. The original object is currently held by [[Tate Britain]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/blake-age-teaching-youth-n05183| title = William BlakeAge Teaching Youth c.1785-90| publisher = [[Tate Britain]]| accessdate = January 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The roots of the practice are lost in antiquity. The word itself was inspired by the character of [[Mentor (Odyssey)|Mentor]] in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]''. Though the actual Mentor in the story is a somewhat ineffective old man, the goddess [[Athena]] takes on his appearance in order to guide young [[Telemachus]] in his time of difficulty.

Historically significant systems of mentorship include the [[Guru–shishya tradition|guru–disciple tradition]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.yogicwayoflife.com/the-guru-disciple-tradition/|title=Guru Disciple Tradition - The Spiritual Lineage|date=2016-10-07|work=Yogic Way Of Life|access-date=2018-06-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;practiced in [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]], [[Elder (administrative title)|Elder]]s, the discipleship system practiced by [[Rabbi]]nical [[Judaism]] and the [[Christianity|Christian]] church&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bible.org/article/being-first-century-disciple|title=Being a First-Century Disciple|work=Bible.org|access-date=2018-06-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and [[apprentice|apprenticing]] under the medieval [[guild]] system&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://technicaleducationmatters.org/2009/05/13/chapter-3-the-guilds-and-apprenticeships/|title=Chapter 3 – The Guilds and Apprenticeships|website=technicaleducationmatters.org|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In the United States, advocates for workplace equity in the second half of the twentieth century popularized the term "mentor" and concept of career mentorship as part of a larger [[social capital]] lexicon which also includes terms such as [[glass ceiling]], bamboo ceiling,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Asian American and Pacific Islander Work Group Report|url = http://www.eeoc.gov/federal/reports/aapi.html|website = www.eeoc.gov|accessdate = 2016-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[personal network|networking]], [[role model]], and [[gatekeeper]]—serving to identify and address the problems barring non-dominant groups from professional success. Mainstream business literature subsequently adopted the terms and concepts, promoting them as pathways to success for all career climbers. In 1970, these terms were not in the general American vocabulary; by the mid-1990s they had become part of everyday speech.&lt;ref name="Laird, Pamela Walker"/&gt;

== Professional bodies and qualifications ==
The [[European Mentoring and Coaching Council]], also called the EMCC, is the leading global body in terms of creating and maintaining a range of industry standard frameworks, rules and processes across the mentoring and related supervision and coaching fields e.g. a code of practice for those practising mentoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m3tAv72yfBMC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;dq=emcc%20mentoring&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjJwKzB8bfTAhUGU1AKHa1mBa0Q6AEIITAA#v=onepage&amp;q=emcc%20mentoring&amp;f=false|title=Facilitating Reflective Learning Through Mentoring &amp; Coaching|first1=Anne|last1=Brockbank|first2=Ian|last2=McGill|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Kogan Page Publishers|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vH1LpGVEgPgC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=emcc%20mentoring&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjJwKzB8bfTAhUGU1AKHa1mBa0Q6AEIOjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=emcc%20mentoring&amp;f=false|title=The Complete Guide to Mentoring: How to Design, Implement and Evaluate Effective Mentoring Programmes|first=Hilarie|last=Owen|date=3 October 2011|publisher=Kogan Page Publishers|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F1vf9RatJhkC&amp;pg=PA123&amp;dq=emcc%20mentoring&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi5lYud8rfTAhUCEVAKHSmuD0g4ChDoAQgoMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=emcc%20mentoring&amp;f=false|title=Coaching and Mentoring in Health and Social Care: The Essentials of Practice for Professionals and Organisations|first=Julia|last=Foster-Turner|date=1 May 2005|publisher=Radcliffe Publishing|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Techniques ==
The focus of mentoring is to develop the whole person and so the techniques are broad and require wisdom in order to be used appropriately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Effective Teaching and Mentoring| author=Daloz, L. A. | year=1990 | publisher=Jossey Bass | location=San Francisco | pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A 1995 study of mentoring techniques most commonly used in business&lt;ref name="Aubrey1995"&gt;{{cite book |title=Working Wisdom: Timeless Skills and Vanguard Strategies for Learning Organizations |publisher=Jossey Bass |year=1995 |pages=23, 44–47, 96–97 |author1=Aubrey, Bob  |author2=Cohen, Paul |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; found that the five most commonly used techniques among mentors were:

# ''Accompanying:'' making a commitment in a caring way, which involves taking part in the learning process side-by-side with the learner.
# ''Sowing:'' mentors are often confronted with the difficulty of preparing the learner before he or she is ready to change. Sowing is necessary when you know that what you say may not be understood or even acceptable to learners at first but will make sense and have value to the mentee when the situation requires it.
# ''Catalyzing:'' when change reaches a critical level of pressure, learning can escalate. Here the mentor chooses to plunge the learner right into change, provoking a different way of thinking, a change in identity or a re-ordering of values.
# ''Showing:'' this is making something understandable, or using your own example to demonstrate a skill or activity. You show what you are talking about, you show by your own behavior.
# ''Harvesting:'' here the mentor focuses on "picking the ripe fruit": it is usually used to create awareness of what was learned by experience and to draw conclusions. The key questions here are: "What have you learned?", "How useful is it?".

Different techniques may be used by mentors according to the situation and the mindset of the mentee, and the techniques used in modern organizations can be found in ancient education systems, from the Socratic technique of harvesting to the accompaniment method of learning used in the apprenticeship of itinerant cathedral builders during the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name="Aubrey1995"/&gt; Leadership authors Jim Kouzes and [[Barry Z. Posner]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Credibility |author1=Posner, B.  |author2=Kouzes, J.  |lastauthoramp=yes | year=1993 | publisher=Jossey Bass | location=San Francisco | pages=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; advise mentors to look for "teachable moments" in order to "expand or realize the potentialities of the people in the organizations they lead" and underline that personal credibility is as essential to quality mentoring as skill.
[[File:Senior editor mentoring junior editor.jpg |thumb|right|200px|A senior editor mentors a junior editor.]]
'''Multiple mentors''': A new and upcoming trend is having multiple mentors.&lt;ref name=Ensher2003&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ensher|first1=E.|last2=Heun|first2=C.|last3=Blanchard|first3=A.|title=Online mentoring and computer-mediated communication: New directions in research|journal=Journal of Vocational Behavior|volume=63|pages=264–288|doi=10.1016/s0001-8791(03)00044-7|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be helpful because we can all learn from each other. Having more than one mentor will widen the knowledge of the person being mentored. There are different mentors who may have different strengths.

'''Profession or trade mentor''': This is someone who is currently in the trade/profession you are entering. They know the trends, important changes and new practices that you should know to stay at the top of your career. A mentor like this would be someone you can discuss ideas regarding the field, and also be introduced to key and important people that you should know.

'''Industry mentor''': This is someone who doesn't just focus on the profession. This mentor will be able to give insight on the industry as a whole. Whether it be research, development or key changes in the industry, you need to know.

'''Organization mentor''': Politics in the organizations are constantly changing. It is important to be knowledgeable about the values, strategies and products that are within your company, but also when these things are changing. An organization mentor can clarify missions and strategies, and give clarity when needed.

'''Work process mentor''': This mentor can speed quickly over the bumps, and cut through the unnecessary work. This mentor can explain the 'ins and outs' of projects, day to day tasks, and eliminate unnecessary things that may be currently going on in your work day. This mentor can help to get things done quickly and efficiently.

'''Technology mentor''': This is an up-and-coming, incredibly important position. Technology has been rapidly improving, and becoming more a part of day to day transactions within companies. In order to perform your best, you must know how to get things done on the newest technology. A technology mentor will help with technical breakdowns, advise on systems that may work better than what you're currently using, and coach you through new technology and how to best use it and implement it into your daily life.

These mentors are only examples. There can be many more different types of mentors. Look around your workplace, your life, and see who is an expert that you can learn something from.&lt;ref name="MasteryWorks"/&gt;

[[File:What is mentoring (14805966275).jpg|thumb|right|400px|Some elements of mentoring.]]

There are two broad types of mentoring relationships: formal and informal.{{cn|date=June 2018}} Formal mentoring relationships are set up by an administrative unit or office in a company or organization, which solicits and recruits qualified individuals who are willing to mentor, provides training to the mentors, and then helps to match the mentors up with a person in need of mentoring. While formal mentoring systems contain numerous structural and guidance elements, they still typically allow the mentor and mentee to have an active role in choosing who they want to work with. Formal mentoring programs which simply assign mentors to mentees without giving these individuals a say have not performed well. Even though a mentor and a mentee may seem perfectly matched "on paper", in practice, they may have different working or learning styles. As such, giving the mentor and the mentee the opportunity to help select who they want to work with is a widely used approach. Informal mentoring occurs without the use of structured recruitment, mentor training and matching services. Informal mentoring arrangements can develop naturally from [[business networking]] situations in which a more experienced individual meets a new employee, and the two strike up a rapport.

In addition to these broad types, there are also peer, situational and supervisory mentoring relationships.{{cn|date=June 2018}} These tend to fall under the categories of formal and informal mentoring relationships. Informal relationships develop on their own between partners. Formal mentoring, on the other hand, refers to a structured process supported by the organization and addressed to target populations. '''Youth mentoring programs''' assist at-risk children or youth who lack role models and sponsors&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ctb.ku.edu/en/table-of-contents/implement/youth-mentoring/overview/main|title=Chapter 22. Youth Mentoring Programs {{!}} Section 1. Building Youth Mentoring Programs {{!}} Main Section {{!}} Community Tool Box|website=ctb.ku.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In business, formal mentoring is part of [[talent management]] strategies which are used to groom key employees, newly hired graduates, high potential-employees and future leaders. The matching of mentor and mentee is often done by a mentoring coordinator, often with the help of a computerized database registry. The use of the database helps to match up mentees with mentors who have the type of experience and qualifications they are seeking.
[[File:Lynne Featherstone mentoring at Youth For Change (14677364996).jpg|thumb|right|200px|A woman provides mentoring at the Youth For Change program.]]
There are formal mentoring programs that are values-oriented, while social mentoring and other types focus specifically on career development. Some mentorship programs provide both social and vocational support. In well-designed formal mentoring programs, there are program goals, schedules, training (for both mentors and protégés), and evaluation. In 2004 Metizo created the first mentoring certification for companies and business schools in order to guarantee the integrity and effectiveness of formal mentoring. Certification is attributed jointly by the organization and an external expert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metizo.com/home/how-metizo-certifies-personal-development |title=How Metizo certifies personal development |publisher=Metizo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many kinds of mentoring relationships from school or community-based relationships to e-mentoring relationships. These mentoring relationships vary&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.inc.com/entrepreneurs-organization/4-key-facets-of-successful-mentoring-relationships.html|title=4 Key Facets of Successful Mentoring Relationships|date=2017-08-11|work=Inc.com|access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be influenced by the type of mentoring relationship that is in effect. That is whether it has come about as a formal or informal relationship. Also there are several models have been used to describe and examine the sub-relationships that can emerge. For example, Buell describes how mentoring relationships can develop under a cloning model, nurturing model, friendship model and apprenticeship model. The cloning model is about the mentor trying to "produce a duplicate copy of him or her self." The nurturing model takes more of a "parent figure, creating a safe, open environment in which mentee can both learn and try things for him-or herself." The friendship model are more peers "rather than being involved in a hierarchical relationship." Lastly, the apprenticeship is about less "personal or social aspects... and the professional relationship is the sole focus".&lt;ref name="Buell2004"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Buell | first = Cindy | title = Models of Mentoring in Communication |journal = Communication Review | issue = 1 | issn = 1479-5795 |date = January 2004 |pages = 56–73 | volume = 53 | doi=10.1080/0363452032000135779}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the sub-groups of formal and informal mentoring relationships: peer mentoring relationships are relationships where individuals are at the same skill training, similar positions and stages of career. However, one person may be more knowledgeable in a certain aspect or another, but they can help each other to progress in their work. A lot of time, peer relationships provide a lot of support, empathy and advice because the situations are quite similar.

'''Situational mentoring''': Short-term relationships in which a person mentors for a specific purpose. This could be a company bringing an expert in regarding social media, or internet safety. This expert can mentor employees to make them more knowledgeable about a specific topic or skill.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

'''Supervisory mentoring''': This kind of mentoring has'go to' people who are supervisors. These are people who have answers to many questions, and can advise to take the best plan of action. This can be a conflict of interest relationship because many supervisors do not feel comfortable also being a mentor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://research.wustl.edu/Resources/PERCSS/library/Pages/mentoringtypes.aspx research.wustl.edu], Washington University in St. Louis.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mentoring circles''': Participants from all levels of the organization propose and own a topic. They then meet in groups to discuss the topic, which motivates them to grow and become more knowledgeable. Flash mentoring is ideal for job shadowing, reverse mentoring, and more.

'''Flash mentoring''': Creates a low-pressure environment for mentoring that focuses on single meetings rather than a traditional, long-term mentoring relationship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronus.com/modern-mentoring-flash-mentoring-for-organizations chronus.com], Chronus.&lt;/ref&gt;

These benefits for a mentee depend on which of the different (not mutually exclusive) functions is performed by the mentor. Originally, the concept of mentoring functions was developed based on [[qualitative research]] in a organizational context with functions being subsumed under two major factors: [[psychosocial support]] (e.g. [[Role model|role modeling]], friendship, emotional support, encouragement) and career-related support (e.g. providing advice, discussing goals).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kram|first=Kathy E.|date=1983|title=Phases of the Mentor Relationship|url=http://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/255910|journal=Academy of Management Journal|language=en|volume=26|issue=4|pages=608–625|doi=10.5465/255910|issn=0001-4273|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early quantitative approach found role modeling to be a distinct third factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scandura|first=Terri A.|last2=Ragins|first2=Belle Rose|date=1993|title=The Effects of Sex and Gender Role Orientation on Mentorship in Male-Dominated Occupations|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0001879183710468|journal=Journal of Vocational Behavior|volume=43|issue=3|pages=251–265|doi=10.1006/jvbe.1993.1046|issn=0001-8791|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mentoring for [[Academic achievement|college success]], a fourth function concerning knowledge transfer was additionally identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nora|first=Amaury|last2=Crisp|first2=Gloria|date=November 2007|title=Mentoring Students: Conceptualizing and Validating the Multi-Dimensions of a Support System|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.2190/CS.9.3.e|journal=Journal of College Student Retention: Research, Theory &amp; Practice|language=en|volume=9|issue=3|pages=337–356|doi=10.2190/cs.9.3.e|issn=1521-0251}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later research also found this function in the context of mentoring [[creativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Form|first=Sven|last2=Schlichting|first2=Kerrin|last3=Kaernbach|first3=Christian|date=2017|title=Mentoring functions: Interpersonal tensions are associated with mentees’ creative achievement.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/aca0000103|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|language=en|volume=11|issue=4|pages=440–450|doi=10.1037/aca0000103|issn=1931-390X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Especially in the workplace, there are also many benefits for an employer in developing a mentorship program for new and current employees.

'''Career development''': Setting up a career development mentoring program for employees enables an organization to help junior employees to learn the skills and behaviours from senior employees that the junior employees need to advance to higher-responsibility positions. This type of mentoring program can help to align organizational goals with employees' personal career goals (of progressing within the organization). It gives employees the ability to advance professionally and learn more about their work. This collaboration also gives employees a feeling of engagement with the organization, which can lead to better retention rates and increased employee satisfaction.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

'''High potential mentoring''': The most talented employees in organizations tend to be difficult to retain, as they are usually seeking greater challenges and responsibilities, and they are likely to leave for a different organization if they do not feel that they are being given the opportunity to develop. Top talent, whether in an innovation or management role, have incredible potential to make great things happen for an organization. Creating a mentoring program for high-potential employees that gives them one-on-one guidance from senior leaders can help to build the engagement of these talented employees, give them the opportunity to develop, and increase their retention in the organization.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

'''Diversity mentoring''': One of the top ways to innovate is by bringing in new ideas from senior employees and leaders from underrepresented groups (e.g., women, ethnic minorities, etc.). Who is an underrepresented group depends on the industry sector and country. In many Western countries, women and ethnic minorities are significantly underrepresented in executive positions and boards of directors. In some traditionally gender segregated occupations, such as [[education]] and [[nursing]], however, women may be the dominant gender in the workforce. Mentors from underrepresented groups can empower employees from underrepresented groups to increase their confidence to take on higher-responsibility tasks and prepare for leadership roles. By developing employees from diverse groups, this can give the organization access to new ideas, new ways of looking at problems, and new perspectives. This also brings cultural awareness and intercultural  dialogue into the workplace.{{cn|date=June 2018}}
[[File:119th Wing Airman promotes mentoring youth 150416-Z-WA217-001.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A US Air Force member providing youth mentoring.]]
'''Reverse mentoring''': While mentoring typically involves a more experienced, typically older employee or leader providing guidance to a younger employee, the opposite approach can also be used. In the 2000s, with the rise of digital innovations, Internet applications and [[social media]], in some cases, new, young employees are more familiar with these technologies than senior employees in the organizations. The younger generations can help the older generations to expand and grow towards current trends. Everyone has something to bring to the table, this creates a "two way street" within companies where younger employees can see the larger picture, and senior employees can learn from young employees.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

'''Knowledge transfer mentoring''': Employees must have a certain set of skills in order to accomplish the tasks at hand. Mentoring is a great approach to help employees get organized, and give them access to an expert that can give feedback, and help answer questions that they may not know where to find answers to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chronus|title=Mentoring &amp; Talent Development Solutions|url=http://chronus.com/how-to-use-mentoring-in-your-workplace|website=chronus.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mentorship provides critical benefits to individuals as well as organizations. Although mentorship can be important for an individual's career advancement, in the United States it historically has been most apparent in relation to the advancement of women and minorities in the workplace. Until recent decades, American men in dominant ethnic groups gained most of the benefits of mentorship without consciously identifying it as an advancement strategy. American women and minorities, in contrast, more pointedly identified and pursued mentorship in the second half of the twentieth century as they sought to achieve the professional success they had long been denied.&lt;ref name="Laird, Pamela Walker"/&gt;

In a 1958 study, Margaret Cussler showed that, for each female executive she interviewed who did not own her own company, "something—or someone—gave her a push up the ladder while others halted on a lower rung." Cussler concluded that the relationship between the "sponsor and protégé" (the vocabulary of "mentorship" was not yet in common use) was the "magic formula" for success.&lt;ref name="Cussler, Margaret"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cussler|first=Margaret|title=The Woman Executive|year=1958|publisher=Harcourt, Brace and Co.|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1970s, numerous publications had established the centrality of mentorship to business success for everyone and particularly for women trying to break into the male-dominated business world. These publications noted the many specific benefits provided by mentorship, which included insider information, education, guidance, moral support, inspiration, sponsorship, an example to follow, protection, promotion, the ability to "bypass the hierarchy," the projection of the superior's "reflected power," access to otherwise invisible opportunities, and [[Tutor|tutelage]] in corporate politics.&lt;ref name="Laird, Pamela Walker"/&gt;

This literature also showed the value of these benefits. A ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' survey of 1,250 top executives published in 1979, for example, showed that most had been mentored or sponsored and that those who received such assistance reported higher income, a better education, a quicker path to achievement, and more job satisfaction than those who did not.&lt;ref name="Roche, Gerard R."&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roche|first=Gerard R.|title=Much Ado about Mentors|journal=Harvard Business Review|date=January–February 1979|pages=14–28|volume=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; The literature particularly emphasized the necessity of mentoring for businesswomen's success.&lt;ref name="Laird, Pamela Walker"/&gt; For example, although women made up less than one percent of the executives in the ''Harvard Business Review'' survey, all of these women reported being mentored.&lt;ref name="Roche, Gerard R."/&gt; In subsequent decades, as mentoring became a widely valued phenomenon in the United States, women and minorities in particular continued to develop mentoring relationships consciously as they sought professional advancement.&lt;ref name="Laird, Pamela Walker"/&gt;

==Contemporary research and practice in the US==
Research in the 1970s, partly in response to a study by [[Daniel Levinson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Seasons of a Man's Life |last1=Levinson |first1=Daniel S. |last2=Darrow |first2=C. N, |last3=Klein |first3=E. B. |last4=Levinson |first4=M. |year=1978 |location=New York |publisher=Random House. |isbn=0-394-40694-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; led some women and African Americans to question whether the classic "white male" model was available or customary for people who are newcomers in traditionally white male organizations. In 1978 [[Edgar Schein]] described multiple roles for successful mentors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Career Dynamics: Matching Individual and Organizational Needs |last1=Schein |first1=Edgar H. |publisher=Addison-Wesley |date=June 1978 |isbn=0-201-06834-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He identified seven types of mentoring roles in his book entitled, ''Career Dynamics: Matching individual and organizational needs'' (1978). He said that some of these roles require the teacher to be in a position of power such as "opener of doors, protector, sponsor and leader."{{cn|date=June 2018}}

Capability frameworks encourage managers to mentor staff. A manager can mentor their own staff, but more likely will mentor staff in other parts of their organisation, staff in special programs (such as graduate and leadership programs), staff in other organisations or members of professional associations.

Mentoring covers a range of roles. Articulating these roles is useful not only for understanding what role you play, but also for writing job applications. Demonstrating how you go about mentoring needs a language of behaviours.

Two of Schein's students, Davis and Garrison, undertook to study successful leaders of both genders and at least two races. Their research presented evidence for the roles of: cheerleader, coach, confidant, counsellor, developer of talent, "griot" (oral historian for the organization or profession), guardian, guru, inspiration, master, "opener of doors", patron, role model, pioneer, "seminal source", "successful leader", and teacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Davis, Jr |first1=Robert L. |last2=Garrison |first2=Patricia A. |year=1979 |title=Mentoring: in search of a typology (MIT Sloan Master Thesis)}}&lt;/ref&gt; They described multiple mentoring practices which have since been given the name of "mosaic mentoring" to distinguish this kind of mentoring from the single mentor approach.

Mosaic mentoring is based on the concept that almost everyone can perform one or another function well for someone else — and also can learn along one of these lines from someone else. The model is seen as useful for people who are "non-traditional" in a traditional setting, such as people of color and women in a traditionally white male organization. The idea has been well received in medical education literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Periyakoil, Vyjeyanthi S. |title=Journal of Palliative Medicine |date=October 2007 |volume=10 |issue=5 |pages=1048–1049 |doi=10.1089/jpm.2006.9911 |journal=Journal of Palliative Medicine |pmid=17985959}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also mosaic mentoring programs in various faith-based organizations.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

==Corporate programs==
[[File:MOI PA video mentoring (4476152064).jpg|thumb|right|200px|A NATO mentor trains two broadcasters on video editing and storytelling techniques.]] 
Corporate mentoring programs are used by mid-size to large organizations to further the development and retention of employees. Mentoring programs may be formal or informal and serve a variety of specific objectives including acclimation of new employees, skills development, employee retention and diversity enhancement.

===Formal programs===
Formal mentoring programs offer employees the opportunity to participate in an organized mentoring program. Participants join as a mentor, protégé or both by completing a mentoring profile. Mentoring profiles are completed as written forms on paper or computer or filled out via an online form as part of an online mentoring system. Protégés are matched with a mentor by a program administrator or a mentoring committee, or may self-select a mentor depending on the program format.

Informal mentoring takes places in organizations that develop a culture of mentoring but do not have formal mentoring in place. These companies may provide some tools and resources and encourage managers to accept mentoring requests from more junior members of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://smartblogs.com/leadership/2012/04/13/how-can-corporate-mentoring-work-for-your-company/],''SmartBlog on Leadership'', 13 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of 1,162 employees found that "satisfaction with a mentoring relationship had a stronger impact on attitudes than the presence of a mentor, whether the relationship was formal or informal, or the design of a formal mentoring program."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ragins | first1 =  | last2 = Rose | first2 = Belle | last3 = Cotton | first3 = John L. | last4 = Miller | first4 = Janice S. | year = 2000 | title = Marginal mentoring: The effects of type of mentor, quality of relationship, and program design on work and career attitudes | url = | journal = Academy of Management Journal | volume = 43 | issue = 6| pages = 1177–1194 | doi=10.2307/1556344}}&lt;/ref&gt; So even when a mentoring relationship is established, the actual relationship is more important than the presence of a relationship.

Fortune 500 companies are also implementing formal mentoring programs on a global scale. [[Cardinal Health]] has had an enterprise-wide formal mentoring initiative in place since 2011. The initiative encompasses nine formal mentoring programs, some enterprise-wide and some limited to specific business segments and functions. Goals vary by program, with some focused on employees facing specific challenges or career milestones and others enabling more open-ended learning and development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mentorcliq.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Cardinal-Health-Mentoring-Case-Study-Conducted-by-APQC-1.pdf|title=Cardinal Health INC Case Study - Technical Mentoring|last=|first=|date=2015|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New-hire programs===
New-hire mentoring programs are set up to help new employees acclimate more quickly into the organization. In new-hire mentoring programs, newcomers to the organization (protégés) are paired with more experienced people (mentors) in order to obtain information, good examples, and advice as they advance. It has been claimed that new employees who are paired with a mentor are twice as likely to remain in their job than those who do not receive mentorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Kaye | first1 = Beverly |last2=Jordan-Evans| title = Love 'Em or Lose Em: Getting Good People to Stay| publisher = Berrett-Koehler Publishers, Inc | year = 2005 | location = San Francisco | page = 117 | isbn=978-1-57675-327-9 |first2=Sharon }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These mentoring relationships provide substance for career growth and benefit both the mentor and the protégé. For example, the mentor gets to show leadership by giving back and perhaps being refreshed about their own work. The organization receives an employee that is being gradually introduced and shaped by the organization's culture and operation because they have been under the mentorship of an experienced member. The person being mentored networks, becomes integrated easier in an organization, gets experience and advice along the way.&lt;ref name="Pompper2006"/&gt; It has been said that "joining a mentor's network and developing one's own is central to advancement" and this is possibly why those mentored tend to do well in their organizations.&lt;ref name="Pompper2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pompper |first1=D. |last2=Adams |first2=J. |title=Under the microscope: Gender and mentor-protege relationships |journal=Public Relations Review |issue=32 |pages=309–315 |publisher=Science Direct |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the organizational setting, mentoring usually "requires unequal knowledge",&lt;ref name="BozemanFeeney2007"/&gt; but the process of mentorship can differ. Bullis describes the mentoring process in the forms of phase models. Initially, the "mentee proves himself or herself worthy of the mentor's time and energy". Then cultivation occurs which includes the actual "coaching...a strong interpersonal bond between mentor and mentee develops". Next, under the phase of separation, "the mentee experiences more autonomy". Ultimately, there is more of equality in the relationship, termed by Bullis as Redefinition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bullis |first1=C. |last2=Bach |first2=W. B. |title=Are mentor relationships helping organizations? An exploration of developing mentee-mentor-organizational identification using turning point analysis |journal=Communication Quarterly |issue=3 |pages=199–213 |year=1989 |volume=37 |doi=10.1080/01463378909385540 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===High-potential programs===
High-potential mentoring programs are used to groom up-and-coming employees deemed to have the potential to move up into [[leadership]] or executive roles. Here the employee (protégé) is paired with a senior-level leader (or leaders) for a series of [[career]]-[[coaching]] interactions. These programs tend to be smaller than more general mentoring programs and mentees must be selected based on a list of eligibility criteria to participate. Another method of high-potential mentoring is to place the employee in a series of jobs in disparate areas of an organization (e.g., human resources, sales, operations management, etc.) all for short periods of time, so they can learn in a "hands-on", practical fashion, about the organization's structure, culture, and methods.

==Matching approaches==
;Matching by committee
Mentees are matched with mentors by a designated mentoring committee or mentoring administrator usually consisting of senior members of the training, learning and development group and/or the human resources departments.  The matching committee reviews the mentors' profiles and the coaching goals sought out by the mentees and makes matches based on areas for development, mentor strengths, overall experience, skill set, location and objectives.

;Matching through self-match technology
Mentoring technology, typically based on computer software, can be used to facilitate matches allowing mentees to search and select a mentor based on their own development and coaching needs and interests. This mentee-driven methodology increases the speed in which matches are created and reduces the amount of administrative time required to manage the program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nobscot.com/press/Workforce_Mentor-Scout-Client-Success-Story.pdf],''Matchmaker, Matchmaker Make Me a Mentor Match'', Workforce Magazine, 16 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The quality of matches increases as well with self-match programs because the greater the involvement of the mentee in the selection of their mentor, the better the outcome of the mentorship.&lt;ref name="Allen TD, Eby LT, Lentz e 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Allen |first1=TD. |last2=Eby |first2=LT. |last3=Lentz |first3=E |title=Mentorship behaviors and mentorship quality associated with formal mentoring programs: closing the gap between research and practice |journal=Journal of Applied Psychology |volume=91 | issue = 3 |pages=567–578|year=2006 |doi=10.1037/0021-9010.91.3.567|pmid=16737355 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a variety of online mentoring technology programs available that can be utilized to facilitate this mentee-driven matching process.

;Speed mentoring
[[Speed Networking|Speed mentoring]] follows some of the procedures of [[speed dating]]. Mentors and mentees are introduced to each other in short sessions, allowing each person to meet multiple potential matches in a very short timeframe. Speed mentoring occur as a one-time event in order for people "to meet potential mentors to see if there is a fit for a longer term engagement."&lt;ref&gt;http://iainstitute.org/documents/mentoring/Speed-Mentoring-Procedures-on-site-event.doc&lt;/ref&gt;

==In education==
{{main|Peer mentoring}}
In many secondary and post-secondary schools, mentorship programs are offered to support students in program completion, confidence building and transitioning to further education or the workforce. There are also [[peer mentoring]] programs designed specifically to bring under-represented populations into science and engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oied.ncsu.edu/divweb/msa/peer-mentor-program/|title=Think and Do The Extraordinary|website=oied.ncsu.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Internet has brought university alumni closer to graduating students. Graduate university alumni are engaging with current students in career mentorship through interview questions and answers. The students with the best answers receive professional recommendations from industry experts build a more credible CV.

=== Instructional coaches ===

Instructional coaches are former teachers or principals that have shown effectiveness in their work of teaching or leading and go through additional training to learn more about the technical skills needed to be an effective coach.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The art of coaching: effective strategies for school transformation|last=Aguilar|first=Elena|publisher=Jossey-Bass|year=2013|isbn=|location=San Francisco|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her book ''The Art of Coaching'', Elena Aguilar recommends that a coach "must have been an effective teacher for at least five years."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Though skills that were effective in the classroom are a must, the coach must also be confident in working with adults, bringing strong listening, communication, and data analysis skills to the coaching position.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Ultimately, an instructional coach is a former teacher who was successful in the classroom and is respected in the field, with the respect carrying over into this new position.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://piic.pacoaching.org/index.php/piic-coaching/what-is-an-instructional-coach|title=What is an Instructional Coach?|last=Dupree|first=Orlena|website=piic.pacoaching.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Activities ====
Coaches seek to work one-on-one with teachers or in a small group setting with teachers to build student achievement in the classroom based on data collected and discussed by both teacher or coach.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  According to Melinda Mangin and KaiLonnie Dunsmore, instructional coaching models may include: "cognitive coaching, clinical supervision, peer coaching and mentoring, formal literacy coaching, informal coaching, or a mixed model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Promoting quality assurance in literacy instruction: The preparation, inquiries and practices of literacy professionals|last=Bukowiecki|first=E.|publisher=New Foundations|year=2012|isbn=|location=Philadelphia|pages=24–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers have described categories of coaching such as data-oriented, student-oriented, managerial, and coaches who work with individual teachers or with groups of teachers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title="Coach" can mean many things: Five categories of literacy coaches in Reading First|last=Deussen|first=T.|last2=Coskie|first2=T.|last3=Robinson|first3=L.|last4=Autio|first4=E.|publisher=U.S. Department of Education, Institute of Education Sciences, National Center for Education Evaluation and Regional Assistance|year=2007|isbn=|location=Washington D.C.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mangin|first=Melinda M.|last2=Dunsmore|first2=KaiLonnie|date=2014-05-14|title=How the Framing of Instructional Coaching as a Lever for Systemic or Individual Reform Influences the Enactment of Coaching|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0013161X14522814|journal=Educational Administration Quarterly|language=en|volume=51|issue=2|pages=179–213|doi=10.1177/0013161x14522814}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ultimately, coaching roles are designed to increase teacher capacity and push teacher improvement through learning opportunities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The practice of instructional coaching is embedded within the work of a teacher, not in isolation of their everyday teaching.  In other words, the coach works with the teacher throughout the school year and meets during the school day with the teacher regarding current lessons, planning, and the observations/data collected.  The discussions between the instructional coach and teacher are built upon mutual respect and a trusting relationship through confidentiality.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Overall, instructional coaching is meant to serve as professional development for the teacher(s).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A coach's main responsibility in this way is to change practice and build knowledge on "new instructional materials, programs, and initiatives" with the teacher.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;   This professional development can come through discussion, but also can come in other forms.  Instructional coaches can model lessons and instructional strategies in the teachers' classroom to show examples and have teachers feel more confident in using these strategies.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Instructional Coaching: A Partnership Approach to Improving Instruction|last=Knight|first=J.|publisher=Corwin Press|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Teacher observations is one of the most powerful ways that coaches can put data for change in front of teachers.  Coaches doing observations and collecting data to debrief with teachers helps paint a picture for teacher improvement.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Effectiveness ====
According to a three-year research study done by the Pennsylvania Institute for Instructional Coaching, there was an increase in student success when instructional coaching was used in the classroom.  This, however, could not be viewed as solely "instructional coaching" in isolation of other factors.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://piic.pacoaching.org/images/PIICdocuments/Research_and_Eval/piic_report_abstract.pdf|title=Instructional Coaching and  Student Outcomes: Findings from a Three Year Pilot Study|last=Medrich|first=E.A.|last2=Fitzgerald|first2=R.|date=2013|website=|access-date=March 20, 2017|last3=Skomsvold|first3=P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The coaching "model emphasizes the simultaneous use of four strategies: one-on-one teacher engagement; evidence-based literacy practices applied across the curriculum; data analytics; and reflection on practice."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Yet, teachers have shared that:

* Ninety-one percent of teachers coached regularly stated that coaches helped them understand and use new teaching strategies.
* Seventy-nine percent of teachers coached regularly said that their coach played a significant role in improving their classroom instruction and practice.
* Teachers who were regularly coached one-on-one reported that:
** They made significant changes in their instructional practice.
** Their students were more engaged in the classroom and enthusiastic about learning.
** Attendance increased dramatically in their classes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In addition to this, "the most effective professional development model is thought to involve follow-up activities, usually in the form of long-term support, coaching in teachers' classrooms, or ongoing interaction with colleagues."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ball|first=D. L.|date=1996|title=Teacher Learning and the Mathematics Reforms:  What We Think We Know and What We Need to Learn|url=|journal=The Phi Delta Kappan|volume=77|pages=500–508}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In most cases, instructional coaching can provide this support and meet this definition of effective professional development.

===== Administrative support =====
There should also be support from administration around the instructional coaching to align the work of the coach and teacher with the school's mission or vision.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Knight focuses on the partnership with the principal being at the core of successful coaching.  Knight explains that the principal and the instructional coach need to be aligned in their goals for the coaching occurring.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  If they have differing desired outcomes for teaching, then the teacher will be receiving mixed messages and caught between improvement and a standstill.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Aguilar suggests that coaches continually ask about the school's goals as well as action steps to meet these and bring into daily coaching.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===== Data-driven strategies =====
In conjunction with this partnership and observations, Knight's belief of data usage is critical for teacher improvement during coaching sessions.  Knight shares how giving opinions and telling a teacher how to improve stops the learning for the teacher and instead creates a barrier between the coach and teacher and makes the teacher expect hand-holding.  Instead, the data needs to tell a story for the teacher to determine moves to try to improve.  This allows ownership for the teacher as well as understanding of their work in conjunction with the work.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===== Relationship building =====
The relationship and trust between the coach and coachee are a critical component of coaching.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  A coach having specific content knowledge and respect in a teacher's field of teaching would help build trust. Another way to build this trust is through confidentiality.  By keeping all conversations confidential and sticking to that, the coachee knows that your word is good.  In addition to relationship building, it is important to let the coachee feel comfortable talking to you about anything—there may need to be the time when a crisis they are facing trumps conversation about the lesson.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Starting a coaching conversation about how life is going for a coachee is also important to relationship building.

===== Content and pedagogical knowledge =====
According to Nelson and Sassi, "knowledge of pedagogical process and content knowledge must be fused" in both understanding teaching and observing teaching.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nelson|first=Barbara Scott|last2=Sassi|first2=Annette|date=2016-06-29|title=Shifting Approaches to Supervision: The Case of Mathematics Supervision|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00131610021969100|journal=Educational Administration Quarterly|language=en|volume=36|issue=4|pages=553–584|doi=10.1177/00131610021969100}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, an instructional coach that is working with a math teacher should know "current mathematics education reform efforts are built on the notion that the ideas in a subject, and the ways in which students and teachers work with the ideas, matter."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shulman|first=L.|date=1986|title=Those who understand: Knowledge growth in teaching. Educational Researcher|url=|journal=Educational Researcher|volume=57|pages=4–14|doi=10.3102/0013189x015002004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It seems clear that a deep pedagogical knowledge as well as deep content specific knowledge are required for the teacher to have confidence in the coach and for the coach to be able to step in and assume the role of the teacher.

Knowledge that coaches need to be effective span just content and pedagogical knowledge.  Aguilar uses the ladder of inference to allow coaches to evaluate their own thoughts, and ultimately use this ladder to help principals and teachers evaluate their own beliefs before jumping to assumptions. Aguilar states that her "list of beliefs has changed over the years. You can change yours, too.  The point is to be mindful of the beliefs from which we're working and to notice the effect of working from those beliefs." Beliefs can change about approaches to teaching, classroom management, or even content knowledge.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Blended mentoring==
Blended mentoring is an implementation of information technology (IT) into the traditional mentoring program&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Celia|first=Argente-Linares, Eva{{!}}Pérez-López, M. Carmen{{!}}Ordóñez-Solana,|date=2016/00/00|title=Practical Experience of Blended Mentoring in Higher Education.|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1127848|journal=Mentoring &amp; Tutoring: Partnership in Learning|language=en|volume=24|issue=5|issn=1361-1267}}&lt;/ref&gt;, intended to give to career counseling and development services the opportunity to adopt mentoring in their ordinary practice.

==Reverse mentoring==
In the reverse mentoring situation, the mentee has less overall experience (typically as a result of age) than the mentor (who is typically older), but the mentee has more knowledge in a particular area, and as such, reverses the typical constellation. Examples are when young internet or mobile savvy [[millennial generation]] teens train executives in using their high end [[smartphone]]s. They in turn sometimes offer insight in business processes.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

==Business mentoring==
The concept of mentoring has entered the business domain as well. This is different from being an [[apprentice]]; a business mentor provides guidance to a business owner or an [[entrepreneur]] on the entrepreneur's business&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/271908|title=10 Places to Find Mentors and Advisors for Entrepreneurs|last=DeMers|first=Jayson|date=2016-03-17|work=Entrepreneur|access-date=2018-06-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. An apprentice learns a trade by working on the job with the "employer".

A 2012 literature review by EPS-PEAKS investigated the practice of business mentoring, with a focus on the [[MENA|Middle-East and North Africa region]].&lt;ref&gt;Pompa, C. (2012) [http://partnerplatform.org/?dk6sxm5w Literature Review on enterprise mentoring]. [http://partnerplatform.org/eps-peaks EPS-PEAKS] query response.&lt;/ref&gt; The review found strong evidence to suggest that business mentoring can have real benefits for entrepreneurs, but highlights some key factors that need to be taken into account when designing mentoring programmes for this to be the case, such as the need to balance a formal and informal approach and to appropriately match mentors and mentees.

'''NOTECHS''' is a system used to assess the non-technical (social and cognitive) skills of crew members in the aviation industry.  Introduced in the late 1990s, the system has been widely used by airlines during crew selection process, picking out individuals who possess capable skills that are not directly related to aircraft controls or systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Averamaete|first1=Van|title=NOTECHS: Non-technical skill evaluation in JAR-FCL|url=http://www.phoenixaviation.ca/NOTECHS%20JAR-FCL.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In aviation, 70 percent of all accidents are induced from pilot error, lack of communication and decision making being two contributing factors to these accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Helmreich, R.L., &amp; Foushee|title=Why crew resource management? Empirical and theoretical bases of human factors training in aviation.|date=1993|publisher=Academic Press.|location=San Diego, CA|pages=3–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;  NOTECHS assess and provide feedback on the performance of pilots' social and cognitive skills to help minimize pilot error and enhance safety in the future.  NOTECHS system also aims to improve the [[Crew Resource Management]] training system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Warton|first1=Chris|title=Pilot Training Evaluation Techniques|date=2012|url=https://www.nbaa.org/events/amc/2011/news/presentations/1010-Mon/NBAA2011-Pilot-Marking-System-Bombardier.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure of NOTECHS ==
Two main non-technical skills that transfer to the aircraft are social and cognitive skills.  Social skills are behaviors mostly done verbally through communication, allowing crew members to discuss possible conflicts and work together to resolve problems.  It heavily emphasizes teamwork, a critical component for an effective operation of aircraft which impacts aviation safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nagel|first1=D.C|title=Human error in aviation operations|date=1988|publisher=Academic Press|location=San Diego, CA|pages=263–303}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Ruffell|title=A Simulator study of the interaction of pilot workload with errors, vigilance and decisions|date=1979|publisher=NASA-Ames Research Center|location=Moffett Field, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples of communication between crew members include acknowledging commands, conducting briefings, and conveying information, all essential components for a safe and efficient flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sexton, B.J.  |author2=Helmreich, R.L.|title=Analyzing cockpit communication: the links between language, performance, error, and workload|date=2000|pages=63–68|edition=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Federal Aviation Administration]] also announced that important areas of communication improvements include pre-flight briefings, and landing procedures.  Cognitive skills are mental processes occurred for gaining situation awareness and selecting decisions, it includes tasks such as planning, prioritizing and decision making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Jim Dow  |author2=Susan Martin|title=Flight Competency by Design: A Qualitative Shift|url=https://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/civilaviation/standards/systemsafety-cass-2003-susanmartin-3213.htm|website=Transport Canada|accessdate=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This set of skill cannot be observed directly, but it can be inferred by examiners when pilot state a decision, an option has taken place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Flin|first1=Rhona|title=Development of the NOTECHS (non-technical skills) system for assessing pilots’ CRM skills|date=2003|url=http://www.abdn.ac.uk/iprc/uploads/files/NOTECHS%20HFAS%20proof%20copy.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A pilot with a strong cognitive mind is more proficient in emergency situations, having a bigger mental capacity to assess the situation and monitor progression on goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aviation Safety Letter|url=http://www.tc.gc.ca/Publications/en/TP185/PDF/HR/TP185E_1_2012.pdf|website=Transport Canada|publisher=Transport Canada|accessdate=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The framework for NOTECHS is divided into three different levels. 
# Category
# Element
# Behavior Marker

=== Category ===
Social and Cognitive skills are the main non-technical skills evaluated.  Both can be broken down into four different categories:
* Co-operation: Skill in which a pilot is able to work and communicate actively among group members and create a mutual working environment 
* Leadership &amp; Managerial: It focuses on pilots' ability to coordinate and manage a task, problem or direct an entire group. This exercise is usually in put in the views of a 'Pilot In Command'
* Situation Awareness: A pilot's perception of the elements in the surrounding, including the aircraft systems, external environment, time, and "the projection of their status in the future"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Endlsey|first1=M|title=Toward a theory of situation awareness in dynamic systems|date=1995|pages=32–64|edition=37|ref=Human Factors}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Decision Making: The ability to recognize a problem, evaluate possible options and choose the final outcome.

=== Element ===
Elements are subset of a category.  For example, the elements under Co-operation are: Team-building and maintaining, Considering Others, Supporting others, and Conflict Solving.  All these elements tie in with the theme of being a group, communicating and cooperating as a team.  The test subjects are evaluated in the following elements:
{| class="wikitable"

|-
|Co-operation
|Team building &amp; maintaining

=== Behavior marker ===
NOTECHS system added the behavior markers under each element in order to "assist the examiner to describe the observed behavior in standardized and objective phraseology"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Avermaete|title=NOTECHS: Non-technical skill evaluation in JAR-FCL|date=1998|url=http://www.phoenixaviation.ca/NOTECHS%20JAR-FCL.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It gives an indication whether a specific action in accordance to the element projects a positive or a negative impact in the overall skill. 
{| class="wikitable"
!Element
!Positive behavior
!Negative behavior
|-
|Considering others
|Helps other crew members in demanding situations
|Hesitates to offer assistance to crew members
|}

== Rating system ==
Individuals rated through NOTECHS are given feedback on their skill performance.  The results provide an indication on which categories they thrive in, and sections that need improvements.  Members are evaluated in each structure element and given a rating on a five-point scale. The scale ranges from very good, good, acceptable, poor, very poor.  In addition, a final overall rating is required in each element, indicating whether it was acceptable or unacceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Flin|first1=Rhona|title=Development of the NOTECHS (non-technical skills) system for assessing pilots’ CRM skills|date=2003|url=http://www.abdn.ac.uk/iprc/uploads/files/NOTECHS%20HFAS%20proof%20copy.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To ensure crew members are given fair and non-accidental evaluation, the Joint Aviation Authorities implemented five operating rules to follow while using the NOTECHS for assessment.
# Only observable behavior is to be assessed: A crew members' personality or emotional attitudes are ignored during the evaluation, and only visible behavior is recorded.  
# Need for Technical Consequence: To receive an unacceptable rating on a non technical skill, the flight safety must be compromised in relation to "Objective technical consequence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Flin|first1=Rhona|title=Development of the NOTECHS (non-technical skills) system for assessing pilots’ CRM skills|date=2003|url=http://www.abdn.ac.uk/iprc/uploads/files/NOTECHS%20HFAS%20proof%20copy.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Acceptable or Unacceptable rating required: In a situation where an examiner is ambiguous with the results of an element, a two-point rating system: ACCEPTABLE or UNACCEPTABLE, is given to finalize the test without any confusion
# Repetition required: Showing of unacceptable behavior will lead the examiner to conduct multiple tries of the same skill test to verify it was not accidental.  Repetition helps to conclude if there is a significant problem in a certain skill
# Explanation required: For each skill given an unacceptable rating, the examiner must state why it was deemed unacceptable and how safety could have been compromised in the short and long term.  A detailed explanation is helpful because it pinpoints out the specific mistakes occurred.

== Usage and relation to Crew Resource Management ==
As an assessment tool, NOTECHS system is heavily used to evaluate crew resource management performance.  CRM is designed to teach pilots about cognitive and interpersonal skills for an effective, safe flight; NOTECHS underlay as a standard guideline for crew members to follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=CAA|title=Crew Resource Management (CRM) Training. Guidance for Flight Crew, CRM Instructors (CRMIs) and CRM Instructor-Examiners (CRMIEs)|date=2003|publisher=Civil Aviation Authority|location=Gatwick, Sussex|url=http://www.caa.co.uk|accessdate=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As NOTECHS evaluation system is based on standardized conditions of acceptable skills and behaviors organized by practitioners, it aims to improve by whether the provided guidance actually enhances the performance of crew members in the work environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goeters|first1=K|title=Evaluation of the effects of CRM training by the assessment of non-technical skills under LOFT|date=2002|publisher=Human Factors and Aerospace Safety|pages=71–86|edition=2|accessdate=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7135">In [[education]], '''narrative evaluation''' is a form of performance measurement and feedback which can be used as an alternative or supplement to [[grade (education)|grading]].  Narrative evaluations generally consist of several paragraphs of written text about a student's individual performance and course work. The style and form of narrative evaluations vary significantly among the educational institutions using them, and they are sometimes combined with other performance metrics, including [[Grading in the United States|letter and number grades]] and pass/fail designations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2424">'''People's Teacher of the USSR''' ({{lang-ru|Народный учитель СССР}}) was an honorary title granted to [[teacher]]s of the [[Soviet Union]]; it was established on 30 December 1977.
Following the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union]] (1990) the title was modified in ''[[National Teacher of the Russian Federation]]''.

The title was conferred, to teachers of Soviet [[secondary schools|secondary]] or [[Professional technical school|vocational schools]] and also to civil servants employed by educational institutions, for worthwhile contributions to the national education system and mainly in teaching [[communism]] to children and young people. It was bestowed owing proposals addressed by the USSR Education Department or by the National Education Committee; together with the medal a diploma of the [[Supreme Soviet]]'s presidency was given to the awarded people.

== Design ==
The medal has a [[circle|circular]] shape and its [[diameter]] is 30&amp;nbsp;mm.  
The central part of the front side is occupied by an open book and a torch encircled by the inscription "Народный учитель СССР" (''People's Teacher of the USSR'') and, above, two [[bay laurel]] branches and the [[hammer and sickle]] symbol.
On the [[Recto and verso|verso]] appears the inscription ''Народный учитель СССР — гордость советского общества (National Teacher of the USSR – Pride of sovietic society).

'''Réseau Canopé''' is a French public institution under the supervision of the [[French Ministry of Education]]. As the publishing arm of the  National Education service, it performs editing, production and dissemination of educational and administrative resources for professional education. It contributes to the development of [[Educational technology|information and communication technologies in education]] (ICTs) as well as artistic and cultural education. "Canopé" stands for ''Conception et accompagnement des nouvelles offres pour l'éducation'' ("Design and Support of New Offers for Education").

In 2014, it replaced the '''National Centre for Educational Documentation''' (''Centre national de documentation pédagogique'', CNDP) and its regional (CRDP) and departmental (CDDP) branches. These and a few other institutions formed the SCÉRÉN network (''Services, Culture, Éditions, Ressources pour l'Éducation nationale'': "Services, Culture, Publishing, Resources for National Education").

The network also includes:
* the [[Centre de liaison de l'enseignement et des médias d'information]] (Clemi);
* the [[Centre de ressources et d’information sur les multimédias pour l’enseignement supérieur]] (Cerimes);
* the National Education Museum.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13551">The '''STEM pipeline''' is a term used to describe the educational pathway for students in the [[STEM fields]], (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics). The start and end of this STEM pipeline are disputed, but it is often considered to begin in early education and extend into graduation or an adult career in STEM.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bu.edu/stem/files/2015/02/The-STEM-Pipeline-booklet1.3-36.pdf|title=The STEM Pipeline|last=Inside Higher Ed|first=|date=2015-02-09|website=Boston University STEM Education Initiatives|publisher=Inside Higher Ed|access-date=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The "pipeline" metaphor is based on the idea that having sufficient graduates requires both having sufficient input of students at the beginning of their studies, and retaining these students through completion of their academic program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Educational Pipeline FAQ| accessdate = 2015-03-02| url = http://www.highereducation.org/reports/pipeline/faq.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; The STEM pipeline is a key component of [[Diversity (business)|workplace diversity]] and of [[Workforce|workforce development]] that ensures sufficient qualified candidates are available to fill scientific and technical positions.

The STEM pipeline was promoted in the United States from the 1970s onwards, as “the push for STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education appears to have grown from a concern for the low number of future professionals to fill STEM jobs and careers and economic and educational competitiveness.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Ryan|last2=Brown|first2=Joshua|last3=Reardon|first3=Kristin|last4=Merrill|first4=Chris|title=Understanding STEM: Current Perceptions|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ918930|journal=Technology and Engineering Teacher|language=en|volume=70|issue=6|pages=5–9|issn=2158-0502}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, this metaphor is commonly used to describe retention problems in STEM fields, called “leaks” in the pipeline. For example, the White House reported in 2012 that 80% of minority groups and women who enroll in a STEM field switch to a non-STEM field or drop out during their undergraduate education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waldrop|first=M. Mitchell|date=2015-07-16|title=Why we are teaching science wrong, and how to make it right|url=http://www.nature.com/news/why-we-are-teaching-science-wrong-and-how-to-make-it-right-1.17963|journal=Nature|volume=523|issue=7560|pages=272–274|doi=10.1038/523272a}}&lt;/ref&gt; These leaks often vary by field, gender, ethnic and racial identity, socioeconomic background, and other factors, drawing attention to structural inequities involved in STEM education and careers.

==Current efforts==
The STEM pipeline concept is a useful tool for programs aiming at increasing the total number of graduates, and is especially important in efforts to increase the number of underrepresented minorities and women in STEM fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ihep.org/sites/default/files/uploads/docs/pubs/report_diversifying_the_stem_pipeline_report.pdf|title=Diversifying the STEM pipeline: the Model Replication Institutions Program|last=Institute for Higher Education Policy|accessdate=2015-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using STEM methodology, educational policymakers can examine the quantity and retention of students at all stages of the K&amp;ndash;12 educational process and beyond, and devise programs and interventions to improve educational processes and outcomes. STEM programs focus on increasing social and academic supports for students. STEM programs may also focus on bringing students together with professionals in their field, to provide mentoring, [[role model]]s and learning opportunities in industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stempipelineinstitute.com/?page_id=9|title=STEM Methodology - Teachers in teams, STEM Innovation at work|work=STEM Pipeline Institute|accessdate=2015-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maintaining a healthy and diverse STEM pipeline has been a concern in several developed countries, such as the United Kingdom, the United States, and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sciencecampaign.org.uk/CaSEDiversityinSTEMreport2014.pdf|title=Improving Diversity in STEM: A report by the Campaign for Science and Engineering (CaSE)|last=King's College, London|work=Campaign for Science and Engineering (CaSE)|accessdate=2015-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.elsevier.com/connect/stem-diversity-initiatives-what-works-what-doesnt|title=STEM diversity initiatives—what works, what doesn't|last=Larkin|first=Marilynn|date=2014-02-12|work=Elsevier Connect|accessdate=2015-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/president-obama-launches-educate-innovate-campaign-excellence-science-technology-en|title=President Obama Launches "Educate to Innovate" Campaign for Excellence in Science, Technology, Engineering &amp; Math (Stem) Education|date=2009-11-23|work=The White House|accessdate=2015-03-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150308185543/http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/president-obama-launches-educate-innovate-campaign-excellence-science-technology-en|archivedate=2015-03-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the [[United States]], although efforts to increase the number of [[women]] and [[African Americans]] in STEM fields have been ongoing, as recently as 2010 the results have been evaluated as "poor".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Robelin| first = Erik W.| title = U.S. Gets Poor Grades in Nurturing STEM Diversity| work = Education Week| accessdate = 2015-03-02| date = 2010-03-22| url = http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2010/03/22/27stem.h29.html?tkn=NWVFcgAJIKVsbeYl2%2BToW1DL8nSEuQXi5ytU&amp;cmp=clp-edweek}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Davis-Lowe| first = OPAS Diversity Committee| title = Fostering STEM Diversity| work = Elsevier Connect| accessdate = 2015-03-02| date = November 2007| url = http://www.elsevier.com/connect/stem-diversity-initiatives-what-works-what-doesnt}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, one report declared that "traditionally underrepresented groups remain underrepresented",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Stem pipeline problems to aid STEM diversity| work = Phys.org| accessdate = 2015-03-02| date = 2014-06-18| url = http://phys.org/news/2014-06-stem-pipeline-problems-aid-diversity.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; while another article commented, "You can go through your entire scholarly trajectory in [[computer science]] without seeing one face of color", where "of color" refers to African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Institute for African American Mentoring in Computing Sciences| title = Creating a Computer Science Pipeline for African Americans| work = Wisconsin Center for Education Research| accessdate = 2015-03-02| date = 2014-04-28| url = http://www.wcer.wisc.edu/news/coverStories/2014/Creating_a_Computer_Science_Pipeline_for_African_%20Americans.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

STEM pipeline programs in the US have been created at various levels. Examples include: the Technology Leadership Institute at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] at the college and university level,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Lack of diversity part of equation in STEM fields| work = Pittsburgh Post-Gazette| accessdate = 2015-03-02| date = 2009-02-10| url = http://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2009/02/10/Lack-of-diversity-part-of-equation-in-STEM-fields/stories/200902100187}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Nevada STEM pipeline at the state level &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Nevada STEM Pipeline, Your Resource for Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics Programs| accessdate = 2015-03-02| url = http://www.nvstempipeline.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Broadening Participation in Computing Alliances at the national level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 28| issue = 1| pages = –2014| last = Charleston| first = LaVar J| title = Creating a Pipeline for African American Computing Science Faculty: An Innovative Faculty/Research Mentoring Program Model| journal = Journal of Faculty Development| accessdate = 2015-03-02| url = http://weilab.wceruw.org/documents/Creating%20a%20Pipeline%20for%20African%20American%20Computing%20Science%20Faculty%20-%20An%20Innovative%20Faculty-Research%20Mentoring%20Program%20Model.pdf|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Educational attainment factors ==
High Schools in the United States implement a STEM pipeline program that combines a dual pathway that enhances mathematical, engineering, and scientific skills along with a supportive group that aims to help underrepresented students aspire to become leaders in the STEM field. Students benefit from the moral support and motivational skills that mentors implement for their correct academic preparation. Teachers, and college mentors become in the life of the students in the program a guidance in their path to be the next generation of leaders. Furthermore, staff members aid students to feel integrated and cared for their well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://grants.nih.gov/training/minority_participation.pdf|title=Expanding underrepresented minority participation|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their path to pursue higher education in the STEM fields, underrepresented students are awarded scholarships that aid them throughout their college years. Scholarships are a factor that allows underrepresented to focus on their academic and allows them to be persistent throughout their years in college.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cue.usc.edu/files/2016/01/DC_Testimony.pdf|title=BROADENING PARTICIPATION IN STEM|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The STEM pipeline program provides a multitude of workshops, and extracurricular activities to work on social and professional development. Moreover, it arranges networking with minorities that went through the program and now currently work in the science, or health field. In addition, to the benefits as an alumnus of the program, every student is invited to become advocates within their community with the goal of increasing the amount of underrepresented students in STEM fields &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digitalcommons.uncfsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1080&amp;context=jri|title=The STEM Pipeline: Recruiting and Retaining African American Female Engineers|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The support of programs such as the STEM pipeline program aims to increase diversity in the workplace with the ambition to create an inclusive safe area where all the members of the team can contribute to the development of innovative ideas in their respective field. Additionally, the diversity of collaborating with different ideas enhances the outcome of the team's desired goal, and facilitates better planning of the timeline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stelar.edc.org/sites/stelar.edc.org/files/ITEST_Preparing_Workforce_FINAL_hires.pdf|title=Preparing Tomorrow’s STEM Workforce Through Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public reactions==
The concept of the STEM pipeline has been met with resistance for its pragmatic overtones. National Science Board Vice Chairman Kelvin Droegemeier calls for a movement away from thinking about the necessary number of STEM workers, in favor of considering the necessary knowledge and skills for the success of all workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=134866|title=Revisiting the STEM workforce {{!}} NSF - National Science Foundation|website=www.nsf.gov|access-date=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The linearity of the STEM pipeline concept has been criticized as neglecting the wide variety of possible career pathways, including interdisciplinary studies, intermittent careers, and STEM-informed work in non-technical fields. A 2015 commentary in Inside Higher Ed suggested that the "leaky pipeline" metaphor may be viewed as pejorative towards individuals who leave the academic track for employment, or use their technical background as the basis for a career in a non-technical field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2015/03/03/essay-calls-ending-leaky-pipeline-metaphor-when-discussing-women-science#.VPXuS0yfvkw.twitter|title=Essay calls for ending the 'leaky pipeline' metaphor when discussing women in science|last=Miller|first=David|date=2015-03-03|work=@insidehighered|accessdate=2015-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 commentary in ''Science'' observed that [[Margaret Thatcher]] and [[Angela Merkel]] could be considered two "leaks" in the pipeline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Penner|first=A.&amp;nbsp;M.|date=2015-01-16|title=Gender inequality in science|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.aaa3781|journal=Science|volume=347|issue=6219|pages=234–235|doi=10.1126/science.aaa3781|issn=0036-8075|accessdate=2015-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have said that increasing the STEM pipeline is not enough to promote workplace diversity. Women and minorities in STEM such as [[Tracy Chou]] have argued that STEM companies must also focus on internal reforms, such as reevaluating inequitable hiring practices and unsupportive workplace culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@triketora/where-are-the-numbers-cb997a57252|title=Where are the numbers?|last=Chou|first=Tracy|date=2013-10-11|website=Medium|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''school leaving age''' is the minimum age a person is legally allowed to cease attendance at an institute of [[compulsory education|compulsory]] [[secondary education]]. Most countries have their school leaving age set the same as their minimum full-time employment age, thus allowing smooth transition from education into employment, whilst a few have it set just below the age at which a person is allowed to be employed.

In contrast, there are numerous countries that have several years between their school leaving age and their legal minimum employment age, thus in some cases preventing any such transition for several years. Countries which have their employment age set below the school leaving age of 5 years old but  (mostly developing countries), risk giving children the opportunity to leave their education early to earn money for their families.

==Leaving age by country==
Some countries have different leaving or employment ages, but in certain countries like China and Japan, the average age at which people graduate is 15, depending upon part-time or full-time learning or employment. The table below states the school leaving ages in countries across the world and their respective minimum employment age, showing a comparison of how many countries have synchronised these ages. All information is taken from the Right to Education Project's table unless otherwise indicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.right-to-education.org/node/279 |title=Country Table - At What Age?...are school-children employed, married and taken to court|publisher=The Right to Education Project|accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, all children between those ages, even if they're refugees or new, have to attend school.
Not attending school with-out proper reason for example; sickness or a doctors visit, is illegal and is seen as wagging which is seen as fraud and punishable by law. Until the age of 12 children cannot be punished by law, but as soon as your child or you turn 12 years of age or older, you can be held responsible for wagging.
Punishments can be done as a fine, temporary jail time or a community service job done under supervision. Fines can be up to € 3 900 00.
These punishments can be given to the student and/or his or her legal parent or guardian.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31613">'''School prayer''', in the context of religious liberty, is state-sanctioned or mandatory [[prayer]] by students in public [[schools]]. Depending on the country and the type of school, state-sponsored prayer may be required, permitted, or prohibited. Countries which prohibit or limit school prayer often differ in their reasons for doing so: In the United States, school prayer cannot be required of students in accordance with the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]]. In [[Canada]], school-sponsored prayer is disallowed under the concept of [[Freedom of conscience]] as outlined in the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Canadian Charter on Rights &amp; Fundamental Freedoms]]. School-sponsored prayer is disallowed in [[France]] as a byproduct of its status as a [[laicism|laïcist]] (religiously neutral) nation. Countries that allow or require school and other state-sponsored prayer include [[Greece]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Iran]], [[Australia]], [[Italy]] and the [[United Kingdom]].

== Countries that prohibit school-sponsored prayer ==

=== United States ===
{{Main|Education in the United States|Religion in the United States}}

In the [[United States]], [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]] are banned from conducting religious observances such as prayer. The legal basis for this prohibition is the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] to the United States Constitution, which requires that

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first part of the amendment ("Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion") is known as the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment|Establishment Clause]] of the First Amendment, while the second part ("or prohibiting the free exercise thereof") is known as the [[Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment|Free Exercise Clause]].

Though each of these clauses originally applied only to the central [[Federal government of the United States|US government]], the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] extended the scope of the entire First Amendment to all levels of government, including the state level,&lt;ref name="mar"&gt;Marshall, W. P. (1999). The School Prayer Decisions. Constitutional Commentary, 16(3), 535. Retrieved from EBSCOhost.&lt;/ref&gt; thus compelling states and their subject schools to adopt an equally detached approach to [[religion]] in schools.

==== School prayer prior to 1962 ====
In the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries, it was common practice for public schools to open with an oral [[prayer]] or [[Bible]] reading.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edgerton Bible Case]] (Weiss v. District Board [1890]): case in 1890 centering around ''in-school prayer''.&lt;/ref&gt;{{not in ref|date=February 2016}} Catholics would sometimes object to the distinct Protestant observations performed in the local schools. For instance, in the [[Edgerton Bible Case]] (''Weiss v. District Board'' (1890)), the [[Wisconsin Supreme Court]] ruled in favor of [[Catholics]] who objected to the use of the [[King James Bible]] in [[Wisconsin]] public schools.  This ruling was based on the state constitution and only applied in Wisconsin.

==== A Turning Point: The "Regents' Prayer" and ''Engel v. Vitale'' ====
The media and popular culture often erroneously credit atheist [[Madalyn Murray O'Hair]] with removing school prayer from US public schools, when the [[Abington School District v. Schempp|case against recitation of the Lord's Prayer in Baltimore schools]] was decided by the Supreme Court in 1963. A more significant case had reached the Supreme Court one year prior, suddenly changing the legal climate for school prayer in the US.&lt;ref name="LAATS, ADAM 1963"&gt;LAATS, ADAM. "Our Schools, Our Country: American Evangelicals, Public Schools, And The Supreme Court Decisions Of 1962 And 1963." Journal of Religious History 36.3 (2012): 319-334. Academic Search Complete. Web. 28 Oct. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, the [[New York Board of Regents]] developed a [[prayer]] recommended (but not required) for the school districts under its purview. The prayer was relatively short: "Almighty God, we acknowledge our dependence on Thee, and we beg Thy blessings upon us, our parents, our teachers, and our country."&lt;ref name ="mar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Boston, Rob 2012"&gt;Boston, Rob. "How Five New York Families Ended Coercive Prayer In America's Public Schools." Church &amp; State 65.6 (2012): 12. MasterFILE Complete. Web. 28 Oct. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The board stated that the prayer would "combat juvenile delinquency and counter the spread of Communism."&lt;ref name="Boston, Rob 2012"/&gt;

Seven years later, Steven I. Engel, a Jew, was upset to see his son’s hands clasped and his head bent in prayer. He told his son that this was “not the way we say prayers.” Engel, a founding member of the [[New York Civil Liberties Union]], brought action along with Daniel Lichtenstein, Monroe Lerner, Lenore Lyons, and Lawrence Roth, all parents of children in the Long Island, New York public school system, against [[Herricks Union Free School District|Union Free School District No. 9]] for its adoption and subsequent prescription of the so-called "[[Christian child's prayer#Regent's prayer|Regent's prayer]]", arguing that it constituted the state-sponsored establishment of religion in violation of citizens’ [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights via the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;Engel v. Vitale. (1999). Supreme Court Cases: The Dynamic Court (1930–1999), N.PAG. Retrieved from EBSCOhost.&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of the Regent's prayer was initially upheld in both [[New York State Unified Court System|New York State Court]] and in the [[New York Court of Appeals]], prompting Engels to petition the [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] in the ''[[Engel v. Vitale]]'' case in 1962. With its 8–1 vote to make public recitation of the Regents' Prayer in public schools unlawful, the U.S. Supreme Court made its first-ever decision on prayer in public schools. It made its second in 1963—the ''[[Abington School District v. Schempp]]'' ruling, which made the corporate reading of the Bible and recitation of the Lord's Prayer unlawful in public schools.&lt;ref name="LAATS, ADAM 1963" /&gt;

==== 1963 and after ====
In these two landmark decisions, ''[[Engel v. Vitale]]'' (1962) and ''[[Abington School District v. Schempp]]'' (1963), the Supreme Court established what is now the current prohibition on state-sponsored prayer in US schools. While the ''Engel'' decision held that the promulgation of an official state-school prayer stood in violation of the First Amendment’s [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment|Establishment Clause]] (thus overruling the [[New York State Unified Court System|New York Courts]]’ decisions), ''Abington'' held that [[Bible]] readings and other public school-sponsored religious activities were prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;''School District of Abington Township, Pennsylvania v. Schempp''. (1999). Supreme Court Cases: The Dynamic Court (1930–1999), N.PAG. Retrieved from EBSCOhost.&lt;/ref&gt; Madalyn Murray's lawsuit, ''Murray v. Curlett'', contributed to the removal of compulsory Bible reading from the public schools of the United States, and has had lasting and significant effects.

Until the lawsuit, it was commonplace for students to participate in many types of religious activities while at school, including religious instruction itself. Nonreligious students were compelled to participate in such activities and were not usually given any opportunity to opt out. The Murray suit was combined with an earlier case, so the Court might have acted without Murray's intervention. With the success of the lawsuit, the intent of the Constitution with regard to the relationship between church and state again came under critical scrutiny and has remained there to this day. While students do continue to pray in public schools, even in organized groups such as "[[See You at the Pole]]", the lawsuit disallowed schools from including prayer as a compulsory activity required of every student. The success of O'Hair's lawsuit led to subsequent lawsuits by Mormon and Catholic families in Texas in 2000 to limit compulsory prayer at school-sponsored football games.

Following these two cases came the Court's decision in ''[[Lemon v. Kurtzman]]'' (1971), a ruling that established the [[Lemon test]] for religious activities within schools. The Lemon test states that, in order to be constitutional under the Establishment Clause, any practice sponsored within state-run schools (or other public state-sponsored activities) must adhere to the following three criteria:&lt;ref&gt;Lemon v. Kurtzman. (1999). Supreme Court Cases: The Dynamic Court (1930–1999), N.PAG. Retrieved from EBSCOhost.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Have a secular purpose;
# Must neither advance nor inhibit religion; and
# Must not result in an excessive entanglement between government and religion.

==== Controversy ====
Reactions to ''Engel'' and ''Abington'' were widely negative, and many school districts and states have attempted to reestablish school-sponsored prayer in different forms since 1962.&lt;ref name ="wal"&gt;Wallace v. Jaffree. Great American Court Cases. Ed. Mark Mikula and L. Mpho Mabunda. Vol. 1: Individual Liberties. Detroit: Gale, 1999. Gale Opposing Viewpoints In Context. Web. 7 Sep. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1990s, controversy in the courts has tended to revolve around prayer at school-sponsored extracurricular activities. Examples can be seen in the cases of ''[[Lee v. Weisman]]'' (1992) and ''[[Santa Fe Independent School Dist. v. Doe]]'' (2000), where public prayers at graduation ceremonies and those conducted via public address system prior to high school games (at state school facilities before a school-gathered audience) were, respectively, ruled unconstitutional.

Despite their attempts to present a clear stance on school-sponsored religious activity, ''Engel'', ''Abington'', and the cases for which these serve as [[precedent]] are cited by some proponents of school prayer as evidence of a contradiction between the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses.&lt;ref name="lee"&gt;Lee v. Weisman. Great American Court Cases. Ed. Mark Mikula and L. Mpho Mabunda.
Vol. 1: Individual Liberties. Detroit: Gale, 1999. Gale Opposing Viewpoints In Context.
Web. 7 Sep. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; While the Establishment Clause proscribes the state sponsorship of religion, the Free Exercise Clause forbids state interference in individual religious exercise. Where a state entity moves to accommodate the right to individual religious expression under the latter clause, opponents of that "expression" may cite such accommodation as state "promotion" of one religious activity over another.&lt;ref&gt;Establishment Clause. (2006). In L. J. Fundukian &amp; J. Wilson (Eds.), American Law Yearbook 2005 (pp. 60-64). Detroit: Gale.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the Free Exercise Clause, the courts have consistently stated that students' setting forth of religious views through prayer cannot be forbidden unless such activity can be shown to cause disruption in the school, yet it remains beyond the scope of the state to require such practice.&lt;ref name="sep"&gt;Preface to "Does Separation of Church and State Threaten Religious Liberty?" (2003). In J. D. Torr (Ed.), Current Controversies. Civil Liberties. San Diego: Greenhaven Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, anyone is allowed to pray in schools in the United States, as long as it is not officially sponsored by the school and it does not disrupt others from doing their work.

''The United States Supreme Court: A Political and Legal Analysis'' discussed the results of a 1991 survey, stating that: "The Court's school prayer decisions were, and still are, deeply unpopular with the public, many politicians and most religions organizations. 95 percent of the population believe in God and some 60 percent belong to a religious organization. In a 1991 opinion poll, 78 percent of Americans support the reintroduction of school prayer."&lt;ref&gt;McKeever, Robert J. ''The United States Supreme Court: A Political and Legal Analysis''. Manchester University Press. 1997. p 34.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of public support for school prayer in the United States, ''The Oxford Companion to the Supreme Court of the United States'' reports, "the public's support for school prayer was translated by various state legislatures into statutes aiding religious schools and practices."&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Kermit. Ely, James W.  Grossman, Joel B. ''The Oxford Companion to the Supreme Court of the United States.'' Oxford University Press. 2005. p 1061.&lt;/ref&gt;  Analysis of multiple polls since the 1970s by sociologist Philip Schwadel showed support for school prayer dipped slightly but remains popular with the majority of Americans, with a recent 2011 poll showing 65 percent support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/01/03/study-catholic-protestant-support-for-in-school-prayer-falls|title=Study: Catholic, Protestant Support for In-School Prayer Falls|author=Jason Koebler|work=US News &amp; World Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== American Public Opinion ====
Questions regarding whether prayer should be present or absent in the United States public school system have been causing controversy for decades due to the need to allow religious freedom and guarantee the rights of the first amendment in the United States constitution. Although the topic has many opponents as well as those who are indifferent to the issue, a 2014 Gallup poll indicates that the majority of Americans, 61%, are in favor of daily prayer in the classroom and 37% oppose daily worship&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/09/what-americans-think-about-the-state-of-education-school-prayer-and-math/432687/|title=What Americans Think About the State of Education, School Prayer, And Math|last=Vasilogambros|first=Matt|date=2015-09-01|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results show that those who attend church on a regular basis are 33% more likely to support prayer in schools than those who rarely attend church (82% and 49%, respectively).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.gallup.com/poll/177401/support-daily-prayer-schools-dips-slightly.aspx|title=In U.S., Support for Daily Prayer in Schools Dips Slightly|last=Inc.|first=Gallup,|work=Gallup.com|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, political ideology also plays a role in determining attitudes towards prayer in schools. Those who identify as Republican are more inclined to support daily prayer than Democrats and Independents, as 80% of Republicans, 64% of Independents, and 45% of Democrats are in favor.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Studies show that these numbers have been steadily dropping since 2001, but the majority of Americans continue to support having religion in the education system.

=== Canada ===

==== British Columbia ====
Prior to 1944, in [[British Columbia]], the ''Public Schools Act'' (1872) permitted the use of the [[Lord’s Prayer]] in opening or closing school. In 1944, the government of [[British Columbia]] amended the ''Public Schools Act'' to provide for compulsory [[Bible]] reading at the opening of the school day, to be followed by a compulsory recitation of the [[Lord’s Prayer]]. This amendment appeared as section 167 of the ''Public Schools Act'', and read as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bccla.org/positions/freespeech/69religion.html "BCCLA Position Paper Religion in public schools, 1969"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110224340/http://www.bccla.org/positions/freespeech/69religion.html |date=2010-01-10 }} Retrieved December 04,2006&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;167. All public schools shall be opened by the reading, without explanation or comment, of a passage of Scripture to be selected from readings prescribed or approved by the Council of Public Instruction. The reading of the passage of Scripture shall be followed by the recitation of the Lord’s Prayer, but otherwise the schools shall be conducted on strictly secular and non-sectarian principles. The highest morality shall be inculcated, but no religious dogma or creed shall be taught. 1948, c.42, s.167&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The compulsory nature of the [[Bible]] reading and prayer recitation was slightly modified by regulations drawn up by the Council of Public Instruction. These regulations provided that either a teacher or student who has conscientious ground for objecting to the religious observances may be excused from them. The procedure to be followed in such cases was outlined in the regulations, which follow in full:&lt;blockquote&gt;Division (15)—Scripture Readings (Section 167)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;15.01 Where a teacher sends a written notice to the Board of School Trustees or official trustee by whom he is employed that he has conscientious objections to conducting the. ceremony of reading prescribed selections from the Bible and reciting the Lord’s Prayer (as provided by Section 167 of the Public Schools Act), he shall be excused from such duty, and in such case it shall be the duty of the Board of School Trustees or official trustee concerned to arrange with the Principal to have the ceremony conducted by some other teacher in the school, or by a school trustee, or, where neither of these alternatives is possible, by one of the senior pupils of the school or by some other suitable person other than an ordained member of a religious sect or denomination.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;15.02 Where the parent or guardian of any pupil attending a public school sends a written notice to the teacher of the pupil stating that for conscientious reasons he does not wish the pupil to attend the ceremony of reading prescribed selections from the Bible and reciting the Lord’s Prayer at the opening of school, the teacher shall excuse the pupil from attendance at such ceremony and at his discretion may assign the pupil some other useful employment at school during that period, but the pupil so excused shall not be deprived of any other benefits of the school by reason of his non-attendance at the ceremony.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1982, the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] received royal assent. Section 2 of the charter guaranteeing freedom of conscience and freedom of religion trumped Section 167 of the ''Public Schools Act'' (1872). Sixteen years later in 1996, based on precedent that would be established in [[Ontario]] (1989), required recitation of the [[Lord’s Prayer]] as outlined in the ''Public Schools Act'' would be held to violate the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Charter of Rights and Freedoms]].

==== Ontario ====
The challenges to [[Christian]] opening and closing exercises occurred mainly in [[Ontario]] with the crucial case being fought in The [[Court of Appeal for Ontario|Ontario Court of Appeal]] in 1988.&lt;ref name="chr"&gt;*[http://web.efc-canada.org/NetCommunity/Page.aspx?&amp;pid=734&amp;srcid=190&amp;__nccssubcid=61&amp;__nccsct=Charter+section+2(a)+cases "Charter section 2(a) cases"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715001037/http://web.efc-canada.org/NetCommunity/Page.aspx?&amp;pid=734&amp;srcid=190&amp;__nccssubcid=61&amp;__nccsct=Charter+section+2(a)+cases |date=2007-07-15 }} Retrieved December 04, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Zylberberg v. Sudbury Board of Education (Director)''' The Ontario Court of Appeal ruled that the use of the [[Lord’s Prayer]] in opening exercises in public schools offended the Charter s. 2(a). 1988. (1988), 65 O.R. (2d) 641, 29 O.A.C. 23 (C.A.). Education regulations did not require the use of the [[Lord's Prayer]] and there was an exemption provision. The [[Court of Appeal for Ontario|Ontario Court of Appeal]] ruled that the regulation infringed religious freedom because schools could use only the [[Lord's Prayer]] rather than a more inclusive approach. It was argued that the exemption provision effectively stigmatized children and coerced them into a religious observance which was offensive to them.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Court of Appeal for Ontario|Ontario Court of Appeal]] was persuaded by the argument that the need to seek exemption from [[Christian]] exercises is itself a form of religious discrimination. The judges described as insensitive the position of the respondents that it was beneficial for the minority children to confront the fact of their difference from the majority.

==== Russow v. British Columbia ====
In 1989, [[Joan Russow]] challenged, in the [[Supreme Court of British Columbia|British Columbia Supreme Court]], the ''Public Schools Act’s'' requirement that in [[British Columbia]] all public schools were to be opened with the Lord’s Prayer and a Bible reading. The argument was similar to the ''Zylberberg'' case and the result was the same: The offending words in the ''Public Schools Act'' were removed as being inconsistent with [[freedom of conscience]] and religion guarantees in the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]. Further following the ''Zylberberg'' case to strike down use of the [[Lord’s Prayer]] in schools,&lt;ref&gt;Zylberberg v. Sudbury Board of Education [Director], 1989, and Russow v. AG [BC], 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Supreme Court of British Columbia|British Columbia Supreme Court]] incorporated the [[Court of Appeal for Ontario|Ontario Court of Appeal's]] decision in ''Zylberberg'' in its entirety.

From 1871 to 1989, observance of school prayer had declined.

With the unfavorable court decision, the requirement for [[Christian]] morning exercises was replaced with the following clauses found in the ''School Act'' (1996) in [[British Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=School Act|url=http://www.bced.gov.bc.ca/legislation/schoollaw/|work=British Columbia Revised School Statues}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Conduct:&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;76 (1) All schools and Provincial schools must be conducted on strictly secular and nonsectarian principles.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;(2) The highest morality must be inculcated, but no religious dogma or creed is to be – taught in a school or Provincial school.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== France ===
As a secular state ([[laïcité]]), [[France]] has no school prayers. Instead, public servants are advised to keep their religious faith private, and may be censured if they display it too openly. The [[French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools]] goes beyond restricting prayer in schools and bans the wearing of conspicuous religious symbols by pupils in public [[Primary education|primary]] and [[Secondary education in France|secondary schools]].

=== Turkey ===
The predominantly [[Muslim]] country of [[Turkey]]  is in the public sphere a strongly [[Secular state|secular]] nation. In this regard, it is much like [[France]], on whose system of [[Laïcité|laïcism]] its founder [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] modelled the rules on religion when he reformed his country in the early 20th century. School prayer is therefore unknown, and suspected religious motivations can cause serious difficulties for public servants. Despite its primarily secular stance, however, courses of religion and morals (which are dominantly [[Islam]]ic) are compulsory to all students during the last years of elementary and throughout high school. In these instances, various [[Salat|Islamic prayers]] and verses are both taught and tested for.

== Countries that permit school-sponsored prayer ==

=== United Kingdom ===
{{Main|Education in the United Kingdom|Religion in the United Kingdom}}{{Outdated section|date=March 2018}}
In [[England and Wales]], the [[School Standards and Framework Act 1998]] states that all pupils in [[state schools]] must take part in a daily act of [[Collective Worship (schools in England and Wales)|collective worship]], unless their parents request that they be excused from attending.&lt;ref name="BHA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanism.org.uk/education/parents/worship-your-rights|title="Collective Worship" and school assemblies: your rights|publisher=British Humanist Association|accessdate=2009-04-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423190617/http://humanism.org.uk/education/parents/worship-your-rights|archivedate=2009-04-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The majority of these acts of collective worship are required to be "wholly or mainly of a broadly [[Christianity|Christian]] character", with two exceptions:
* Religious schools, which should provide worship appropriate to the school's religion (although most religious schools in the UK are Christian.)
* Schools where the [[local education authority]]'s [[Standing Advisory Council on Religious Education]] has determined that Christian worship would not be appropriate for part or all of the school.

Despite this statutory requirement for schools to hold a daily act of collective worship, most do not. [[Ofsted]]'s 2002-03 annual report, for example, stated that 80% of [[secondary schools]] were not providing daily worship for all pupils.&lt;ref name="Ofsted"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archive2.official-documents.co.uk/document/deps/ofsted/170/05-secondary.html|title=Standards and Quality 2002/03|date=2004-02-04|publisher=Ofsted|accessdate=2009-04-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101030003158/http://www.archive2.official-documents.co.uk/document/deps/ofsted/170/05-secondary.html|archivedate=2010-10-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Department of Education in England states that all schools must maintain religious prayer in schools in order to reflect the beliefs and traditions of the country, which is predominantly of the Christian faith. However, a recent BBC radio study shows that 64% of children (out of 500) do not attend or participate in daily acts of worship or prayer.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-14794472|title=Schools 'not providing worship'|date=2011-09-06|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding public opinion in the United Kingdom for mandated school prayer, the numbers are relatively similar. In fact, a 2011 survey conducted by BBC found that 60% of parents (out of the 1,743 questioned) believed that the legislation that requires group worship should not be enforced at all.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Although parents do retain the right to officially keep their children from taking part in daily worship, there are critics who claim the legislation should be changed or discarded completely in order to allow for religious freedom and cater to the wants of parents, children, and staff.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Ongoing debate ==

=== Arguments for and against school prayer ===
The issue of school prayer remains contentious even where courts as diverse as those in [[Canada]], the [[United States]], [[Russia]], and [[Poland]] attempt to strike a balance between religious and secular activity in state-sponsored arenas.&lt;ref name="sep" /&gt; Some arguments have held that religion in schools is both an effective sociomoral tool&lt;ref&gt;There Should Be Prayer and Bible Study in Public Schools.

In recent years [[Yoga as exercise|yoga exercise]] has been introduced into some public schools in the U.S., despite modern yoga's historical roots as a [[Hinduism|Hindu]] religious practice. Advocates for the programs say they help children to relax and concentrate, but critics counter that the programs violate the separation of church and state.&lt;ref name="yoga in school"&gt;{{cite news|title=Yoga causes controversy in public schools|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16859368/ns/health-childrens_health/t/yoga-causes-controversy-public-schools/#.UAsSaWE7Xko|newspaper=Associated Press|date=January 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yoga in NY schools"&gt;{{cite news|title=Parents, Religious Leaders Want Yoga Out of New York High School |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,432044,00.html|publisher=Associated Press|date=October 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Moment of silence" ===
Despite ongoing debate, there are some instances where religious freedom and secular stability have been temporarily balanced. In the [[United States]], some administrations have introduced a "[[moment of silence]]" or "moment of reflection" in which a student may, if he or she wishes to, offer a silent [[prayer]]. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] decision in ''[[Wallace v. Jaffree]]'' (1984) held that a [[moment of silence]] in schools for the purpose of individual [[prayer]] or [[meditation]] constituted a valid application of the [[Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment|Free Exercise Clause]], while a [[moment of silence]] for the clear intended purpose of a state-approved devotional activity constituted a violation of the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment|Establishment Clause]].&lt;ref name="wal" /&gt; In this same case, the issue of school prayer was further complicated by a distinction made between a public assembly attended by participants of their own free will, and a public event where attendance is legally required. A voluntarily attended [[United States Congress|Congress]] may open [[United States Congress#Sessions|sessions]] with a prayer, but schools full of public pupils may not. Here the [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] has interpreted the issue as revolving around the degree of a government’s ability to indoctrinate its citizens.&lt;ref name="wal" /&gt;  If it appears that participants at a state-sponsored event are more likely to influence the State itself, courts may treat prayer as "legislative prayer". If, on the other hand, the State is more likely to influence participants at its events, courts may treat prayer as "state-sponsored" prayer and thereby rule it unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;School Board Meeting Prayer Ruled Unconstitutional. (2011). Education Week, 31(1), 4. Retrieved from EBSCOhost.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Secular education''' is a system of public education in countries with a [[secular]] government or [[separation of church and state|separation]] between [[religion]] and [[Sovereign state|state]].

An example of a secular educational system would be the [[Education in France|French public educational system]], where [[French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools|conspicuous religious symbols]] have been banned in schools. 
While some religious groups are hostile to secularism and see such measures as promoting [[atheism]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.missionislam.com/homed/response.htm The Islamic Response to the Secular Educational System]&lt;/ref&gt; other citizens claim that the display of any religious symbol constitutes an infringement of the [[separation of church and state]] and a discrimination against atheist, agnostic and non-religious people.

'''Senioritis''' is a [[Colloquialism|colloquial term]] mainly used in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] to describe the decreased [[motivation]] toward studies displayed by students who are nearing the end of their [[high school]], [[college]], and [[graduate school]] careers, or the end of the school year in general. It combines the word ''senior'' with the suffix ''-itis'', which technically denotes [[inflammation]] but in colloquial speech is assumed to mean a general illness.

== Research ==
Writer [[James Samuel Coleman|James Coleman]], Chairman of the President's Panel of Youth, urged changes in the high school curriculum to address the problem of senioritis. These concerns gave rise to the implementation of a "Senior Semester" in many high schools throughout the country, which allowed seniors to spend time outside of the school or attend seminars in their specific interests. In 1974, for example, [[McKeesport Area High School]] in [[Pennsylvania]] received a grant from the [[Richard King Mellon Foundation]] to establish a "Senior Semester" Program.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The ''Evaluation Report for Senior Semester Program 1974-75 McKeesport Area Senior High School, McKeesport, Pennsylvania'' was produced by the Office of Measurement and Evaluation, University of Pittsburgh, July 1975.  The ''Director's Report for Senior Semester Program 1974-75'' by Dr. Lester F. Jipp can be found at ERIC ED 157 165.

The [[College Board]], the [[National Youth Leadership Council]], and other youth-serving organizations suggest that there are many ways schools can help young people make the most of their senior year instead of succumbing to the temptation to take it easy once graduation is assured. Giving young people opportunities to make their academic work more meaningful through [[service-learning]], or other forms of [[experiential education]], can increase students' academic aspirations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nylc.org/inaction_init_downloads.cfm?oid=3698 Martin et al. "The Impact of Service-Learning on the Transitions to Adulthood", ''Growing to Greatness 2006''] St. Paul: NYLC, page 19.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218185622/http://www.nylc.org/inaction_init_downloads.cfm?oid=3698 |date=December 18, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consequences ==

In some more serious cases where students allow their grades to drop quite significantly, especially failing, [[university|universities]] may rescind offers of [[University and college admissions|admission]]. Those who experience senioritis are often shocked when colleges and universities send them a letter the summer before their fall semester starts telling them that they can no longer attend the college due to failure in the academic rigor that they promised in the interview or application process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Tanya|last= Schevitz|title= Colleges crack down on taking freshmen with 'senioritis'|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/10/10/BAGL9LLT7J1.DTL&amp;hw=senioritis&amp;sn=031&amp;sc=511 |work= The San Francisco Chronicle|date= October 10, 2006|accessdate=2008-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, it is widely known that most colleges do not rescind, and even the most elite schools only revoke a very small number of students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Jay|last= Mathews|title= In Praise of Senioritis|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/03/AR2008020302355.html |work= The Washington Post|date= February 4, 2008|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, senioritis in high school may still cause the incoming college freshmen not to be as adequately prepared for the rigor of college level studies, and may decrease their ability to gain entrance scholarships. Because [[Advanced Placement]], [[International Baccalaureate]], and other advanced classes generally do not have their final exams until early May, they provide a challenge to seniors who are battling with senioritis issues, since most college and university admissions are decided in March and April and students in advanced classes have to overcome the pull of senioritis during the time gap between those two events. In addition, some advanced classes have tests, projects, and other major things relevant to the curriculum spread throughout the second semester; thereby ensuring that students remain busy with a constant stream of deadlines.

Social studies the practice of promoting a [[student]] (usually a general education student, rather than a [[special education]] student) to the next [[Educational stage|grade]] after the current school year, regardless of if they learned the necessary material or if they are often absent. This is done in order to keep the students with their peers by age, that being the intended social grouping. It is sometimes referred to as promotion based on '''seat time''', or the amount of time the child spent sitting in school. This is based on the enrollment criteria for Kindergarten, which is being 4 or 5 years old (5 or 6 years old for 1st graders) at the beginning of the school year. The intention is for the students to be able to graduate from high school level education before their 19th birthday.

Advocates of social promotion argue that promotion is done in order not to harm the students' or their classmates' [[self-esteem]], to encourage socialization by age (together with their [[Cohort (statistics)|age cohort]]), to facilitate student involvement in sports teams, or to promote a student who is weak in one subject on the basis of strength in the other areas.

In [[Canada]] and the [[United States]], social promotion is normally limited to [[primary education]], because comprehensive [[secondary education]] is more flexible about determining which level of students take which classes due to the graduation requirements, which makes the concept of social promotion much less meaningful.
 
In some countries, [[grade retention]] is allowed when students haven't learned the necessary material or if they are often absent.

The opposite of social promotion would be to promote students once they learned the necessary material. This might be called "merit promotion", similar to the concept of a "merit civil service". The scope of the promotion might then be either to the next grade or to the next course in the same field. In a curriculum based on grades, this is usually called "mid-term promotion". In a curriculum based on courses rather than grades, the promotion is open-ended and is better understood as satisfying a prerequisite for the next course.

==Pros==
Supporters of social promotion policies do not defend social promotion so much as say that [[grade retention|retention]] is even worse. They argue that retention is not a cost-effective response to poor performance when compared to cheaper or more effective interventions, such as additional tutoring and summer school. They point to a wide range of research findings that show no advantage to, or even harm from, retention, and the tendency for gains from retention to wash out.

Harm from grade retention cited by these critics include:
* Increased drop-out rates of repeaters over time
* This may be proven true by data from studies by Allenseorth (2005), and the data recorded by Frey (2005) where drop out rates in Minnesota schools for non-repeaters nearly doubled from non-repeaters at 12.4% and to retained student drop out rates jumping to 27.2%
* No evidence of long-term academic benefit for retained students
* Increased rates of [[mental disorders]] and dangerous behaviors such as drinking, drug-use, crime, teenage pregnancy, depression, and suicide among repeaters as compared with similarly performing promoted students.
* Feeling left out with kids from different age groups, which means that being too old may lead to bullying, having fewer friends, and being ridiculed.

Critics of retention also note that retention has hard financial costs for school systems: requiring a student to repeat a grade is essentially to add one student for a year to the school system, assuming that the student does not drop out. Some parents worry that older retained students will victimize younger students.

==Cons==
Opponents of social promotion argue that it cheats children of education. When socially promoted children reach higher levels of education, they may be unprepared, may fail courses, and may not make normal progress towards graduation.

Opponents of social promotion argue that it has the following negative impacts:
* Students who have to wait for the end of the school year to move on to more advanced studies are denied present success.
* Students promoted to a class for which they are known to be unable to do the work are positioned for further failure.
* Students can have so many easy successes during subsequent years that either their study skills deteriorate or they become so frustrated with banal lessons that they drop out.
* Students can have many failures during the subsequent years, which is frustrating for them and may increase the risk of dropping out.
* Their frustration at sitting through "baby classes" can lead to classroom disruptions or the humiliation of others.
* Their frustration can lead to classroom disruptions, which can diminish the achievement of others.
* It sends the message to all students that they can get by without working hard.
* It forces the next teacher to deal with already-prepared and under-prepared students while trying to teach the prepared
* It gives parents and students a false sense of their children's progress.
* It creates social fiefdoms of same-age peers, their consequent peer pressure causing bullying and drug abuse.

Some hold that most students at the elementary school level don't take their education seriously and therefore retention is most likely not to be effective. Since most middle school students value their education more {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}, retention should be used if they are judged not to have adequate skills before entering high school.

It can also be argued that social promotion, by keeping most students at the elementary school level from advancing at their own pace, is the reason they don't take their education seriously. Eliminating the social promotion system would then make the incentives of merit promotion more effective at the beginning of each student's academic career.

== Statistics ==
In the United States,  retention is more common for boys and non-white students than it is for girls and white students. By the time students reach high school, the retention rate for boys is about ten percentage points higher than for girls. In the early grades, retention rates are similar among [[white Americans]], [[African Americans]], and [[Hispanics in the United States|Hispanic Americans]]. By high school, the rate is about 15 percentage points higher for African Americans and Hispanics than for whites.{{full citation needed|date=April 2012}}

There is much to be said about social promotion and retention. If students are socially promoted, some argue that they are being disadvantaged because they haven't learned the material. If they are retained, students will be older than their peers in the classroom, which may cause problems as well. African American boys are the group that are most often retained in school. By the time the students reach the ages of 15-17, 50% of African American boys are either below the grade of their peers that age or have dropped out of school. In contrast, only 30% of white girls ages 15–17 are below the modal grade of their peers.&lt;ref&gt;Hauser, Robert M. Should We End Social Promotion? Truth and Consequences. N.p.: n.p., n.d. Center for Demography and Ecology The University of Wisconsin-Madison. Web. 20 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, educational researcher [http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~hauser/ Robert Hauser] said of the New York City school district:  "In its plan to end social promotion the administration appears to have [included] ... an enforcement provision—flunking kids by the carload lot—about which the great mass of evidence is strongly negative.  And this policy will hurt poor and minority children most of all." [Glavin, C. (2014, February 5). Studies. Retrieved from http://www.k12academics.com/education-issues/social-promotion/studies#.WSBLyLwrK8o]

In a study of 99,000 Florida students, Jay P. Greene and Marcus A. Winters [http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/edfp.2007.2.4.319] found that "retained students slightly outperformed socially promoted students in reading in the first year after retention, and these gains increased substantially in the second year. Results were robust across two distinct IV comparisons: an across-year approach comparing students who were essentially separated by the year in which they happened to have been born, and a regression discontinuity design." ["Revisiting Grade Retention: An evaluation of Florida's test-based Promotion Policy in Education and Finance Policy, MIT Press, 2006]

== History ==
With the proliferation of graded schools in the middle of the 19th century, retention became a common practice, as were mid-term promotions.  In fact, a century ago, approximately half of all American students were retained at least once before the age of 13.&lt;ref name=Rose&gt;Rose, Janet S.;  et al.  "A Fresh Look at the Retention-Promotion Controversy."  Journal of School Psychology, v21 n3 p201-11 Fall 1983. [http://www.eric.ed.gov:80/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ292730&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ292730]&lt;/ref&gt;

Social promotion began to spread in the 1930s along with concerns about the psychosocial effects of retention.&lt;ref name=Rose /&gt;  This trend reversed in the 1980s, as concern about slipping academic standards rose.

The practice of grade retention in the U.S. has been climbing steadily since the 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;Leckrone, M. J. &amp; B. G. Griffith. (2006) “Retention realities and educational standards.” In ''Children &amp; Schools'' 28(1) p53-58  See article at http://www.redorbit.com/news/education/357610/retention_realities_and_educational_standards/&lt;/ref&gt; although local educational agencies may or may not follow this trend.  For example, in 1982, [[New York City]] schools stopped social promotions. Within a few years, the problems caused by the change in policy led the city to start social promotion again. In 1999, the city once again eliminated social promotion; it reinstated it after the number of repeaters had mounted to 100,000 by 2004, driving up costs and leading to cutbacks in numerous programs, including those for helping underachievers.

==Alternatives==
Apart from the social promotion, there is the [[grade retention]], in which students repeat a grade when they are judged to be a low performer. The aim of grade retention is to help the student learn and sharpen skills such as organization, management, [[study skills]], literacy and academic which are very important before entering the next grade, [[Higher education|college]] and the [[labor force]].

In the US simple social promotion was not held to be an adequate alternative to the grade retention.  Current theories among academic scholars prefer to address underperformance problems with remedial help. Students with singular needs or disabilities require special teaching approaches, equipment, or care within or outside a regular classroom. Since students with intellectual disabilities are handled separately, schools may treat two students with identical achievements differently, if one of the students is low-performing, but typically developing,  and the other student is low-performing due to a disability.

Apart from the social promotion, there is the merit promotion, either by mid-term promotion or by using a course-based curriculum with a directed acyclic graph of prerequisites similar to college curricula. This alternative is unique in allowing each student to advance at his or her own pace. It would also save school districts money by ending the practice of warehousing "talented and gifted students" and allowing those students to graduate early.

[[File:LockeEducation1693.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Page reads "Some Thoughts Concerning Education. London, Printed for A. and J. Churchill, at the Black Swan in Pater-noster-row, 1693."|Title page from the first edition of [[John Locke|Locke's]] ''Some Thoughts Concerning Education'' (1693)]]
'''''Some Thoughts Concerning Education''''' is a 1693 treatise&lt;!--do not link to treatise - it redirects to "tract (literature)" which is not the same thing--&gt; on the education of gentlemen written by the English philosopher [[John Locke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |author-link=|year=1693 |editor-last= |editor-first= |contribution= |title=Some Thoughts Concerning Education|volume= |edition= 1|publisher=A.and J.

It was translated into almost all of the major written European languages during the eighteenth century, and nearly every European writer on education after Locke, including [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], acknowledged its influence.

In his ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding|Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1690), Locke outlined a new [[philosophy of mind|theory of mind]], contending that the gentleman's mind was a ''[[tabula rasa]]'' or "blank slate"; that is, it did not contain any [[innate idea]]s. ''Some Thoughts Concerning Education'' explains how to educate that mind using three distinct methods: the development of a healthy body; the formation of a virtuous character; and the choice of an appropriate academic curriculum.

Locke wrote the letters that would eventually become ''Some Thoughts'' for an aristocratic friend, but his advice had a broader appeal since his educational principles suggested anyone could acquire the same kind of character as the aristocrats for whom Locke originally intended the work.

==Historical context==
{{Locke}}
Rather than writing a wholly original philosophy of education, Locke, it seems, deliberately attempted to popularise several strands of seventeenth-century educational reform at the same time as introducing his own ideas. English writers such as [[John Evelyn]], [[John Aubrey]], [[John Eachard]], and [[John Milton]] had previously advocated "similar reforms in curriculum and teaching methods," but they had not succeeded in reaching a wide audience.&lt;ref&gt;Ezell, Margaret J.M. "John Locke's Images of Childhood: Early Eighteenth-Century Responses to ''Some Thoughts Concerning Education''." ''Eighteenth-Century Studies'' 17.2 (1983–84), 141.&lt;/ref&gt; Curiously, though, Locke proclaims throughout his text that his is a revolutionary work; as Nathan Tarcov, who has written an entire volume on ''Some Thoughts'', has pointed out, "Locke frequently explicitly opposes his recommendations to the 'usual,' 'common,' 'ordinary,' or 'general' education."&lt;ref&gt;Tarcov, Nathan. ''Locke's Education for Liberty''. Chicago: University  of Chicago Press (1984), 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

As England became increasingly [[mercantilism|mercantilist]] and [[secularism|secularist]], the [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] educational values of the [[Renaissance]], which had enshrined [[scholasticism]], came to be regarded by many as irrelevant.&lt;ref&gt;Axtell, James L. "Introduction." ''The Educational Writings of John Locke''. Ed. James L. Axtell. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press (1968), 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Following in the intellectual tradition of [[Francis Bacon]], who had challenged the cultural authority of the [[classics]], reformers such as Locke, and later [[Philip Doddridge]], argued against [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] and [[Oxford University|Oxford]]'s decree that "all Bachelor and Undergraduates in their Disputations should lay aside their various Authors, such that caused many dissensions and strives in the Schools, and only follow [[Aristotle]] and those that defend him, and take their Questions from him, and that they exclude from the Schools all steril and inane Questions, disagreeing from the ancient and true Philosophy [sic]."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Frances A. Yates, "Giodano Bruno's Conflict with Oxford." ''Journal of the Warburg Institute'' 2.3 (1939), 230.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of demanding that their sons spend all of their time studying [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and [[Latin]] texts, an increasing number of families began to demand a practical education for their sons; by exposing them to the [[scientific revolution|emerging sciences]], [[history of mathematics|mathematics]], and the modern languages, these parents hoped to prepare their sons for the changing economy and, indeed, for the new world they saw forming around them.&lt;ref&gt;Axtell, 69&amp;ndash;87.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text==
In 1684 Edward Clarke asked his friend, John Locke, for advice on raising his son and heir, Edward, Jr.; Locke responded with a series of letters that eventually served as the basis of ''Some Thoughts Concerning Education''.&lt;ref&gt;Axtell, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; But it was not until 1693, encouraged by the Clarkes and another friend, [[William Molyneux]], that Locke actually published the treatise; Locke, "timid" when it came to public exposure, decided to publish the text anonymously.&lt;ref&gt;Axtell, 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Locke revised and expanded the text five times before he died,&lt;ref&gt;Axtell, 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; he never substantially altered the "familiar and friendly style of the work."&lt;ref name="Tarcov, 79."&gt;Tarcov, 79.&lt;/ref&gt; The "Preface" alerted the reader to its humble origins as a series of letters and, according to Nathan Tarcov, who has written an entire volume on ''Some Thoughts'', advice that otherwise might have appeared "meddlesome" became welcome. Tarcov claims Locke treated his readers as his friends and they responded in kind.&lt;ref name="Tarcov, 79."/&gt;

==Pedagogical theory==
Of Locke's major claims in the ''[[Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' and ''Some Thoughts Concerning Education'', two played a defining role in eighteenth-century educational theory. The first is that education makes the man; as Locke writes at the opening of his treatise, "I think I may say that of all the men we meet with, nine parts of ten are what they are, good or evil, useful or not, by their education."&lt;ref&gt;Locke, John. ''Some Thoughts Concerning Education and of the Conduct of the Understanding.'' Eds. Ruth W. Grant and Nathan Tarcov. Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Co., Inc. (1996), 10; see also Tarcov, 108.&lt;/ref&gt; In making this claim, Locke was arguing against both the [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustinian]] view of man, which grounds its conception of humanity in [[original sin]], and the [[René Descartes|Cartesian]] position, which holds that man innately knows basic logical propositions.&lt;ref&gt;Ezell, 140.&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Essay'' Locke posits an "empty" mind—a ''[[tabula rasa]]''—that is "filled" by experience. In describing the mind in these terms, Locke was drawing on [[Plato]]'s ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theatetus]]'', which suggests that the mind is like a "wax tablet".&lt;ref&gt;Simons, Martin. "Why Can't a Man Be More Like a Woman? (A Note on John Locke's Educational Thought)." ''Educational Theory'' 40.1 (1990), 143.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Locke argued strenuously for the ''tabula rasa'' theory of mind, he nevertheless did believe in innate talents and interests.&lt;ref&gt;Yolton, John W. ''The Two Intellectual Worlds of John Locke: Man Person, and Spirits in the'' Essay. Ithaca: Cornell University Press (2004), 29–31 and John Yolton, ''Locke: An Introduction''. New York: Basil Blackwell (1985), 19–20; see also Tarcov, 109.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, he advises parents to watch their children carefully to discover their "aptitudes," and to nurture their children's own interests rather than force them to participate in activities which they dislike&lt;ref&gt;Yolton, ''John Locke and Education'', 24&amp;ndash;5.&lt;/ref&gt;—"he, therefore, that is about children should well study their natures and aptitudes and see, by often trials, what turn they easily take and what becomes them, observe what their native stock is, how it may be improved, and what it is fit for."&lt;ref&gt;Locke, ''Some Thoughts'', 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Locke also discusses a theory of the self. He writes: "the little and almost insensible impressions on our tender infancies have very important and lasting consequences."&lt;ref&gt;Locke, ''Some Thoughts'', 10.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the "[[Association of Ideas|associations of ideas]]" made when young are more significant than those made when mature because they are the foundation of the self—they mark the ''tabula rasa''. In the ''Essay'', in which he first introduces the theory of the association of ideas, Locke warns against letting "a foolish maid" convince a child that "goblins and sprites" are associated with the darkness, for "darkness shall ever afterwards bring with it those frightful ideas, and they shall be so joined, that he can no more bear the one than the other."&lt;ref&gt;Locke, John. ''An Essay Concerning Human Understanding''. Ed. [[Roger Woolhouse]]. New York: Penguin Books (1997), 357.&lt;/ref&gt;

Locke's emphasis on the role of experience in the formation of the mind and his concern with false associations of ideas has led many to characterise his theory of mind as passive rather than active, but as Nicholas Jolley, in his introduction to Locke's philosophical theory, points out, this is "one of the most curious misconceptions about Locke."&lt;ref&gt;Jolley, 28.&lt;/ref&gt; As both he and Tarcov highlight, Locke's writings are full of directives to  seek out knowledge actively and reflect on received opinion; in fact, this was the essence of Locke's challenge to innatism.&lt;ref&gt;Tarcov, 83ff and Jolley 28ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Body and mind===
Locke advises parents to carefully nurture their children's physical "habits" before pursuing their academic education.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, ''Some Thoughts'', 11–20.&lt;/ref&gt; As many scholars have remarked, it is unsurprising that a trained physician, as Locke was, would begin ''Some Thoughts'' with a discussion of children's physical needs, yet this seemingly simple generic innovation has proven to be one of Locke's most enduring legacies—Western child-rearing manuals are still dominated by the topics of food and sleep.&lt;ref&gt;Hardyment, Christina. ''Dream Babies: Child Care from Locke to Spock''. London: Jonathan Cape (1983), 226; 246–7; 257–72.&lt;/ref&gt; To convince parents that they must attend to the health of their children above all, Locke quotes from [[Juvenal]]'s ''Satires''—"a sound mind in a sound body." Locke firmly believed that children should be exposed to harsh conditions while young to inure them to, for example, cold temperatures when they were older: "Children [should] be not too ''warmly clad or covered'', winter or summer" (Locke's emphasis), he argues, because "bodies will endure anything that from the beginning they are accustomed to."&lt;ref&gt;Locke, ''Some Thoughts'', 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, to prevent a child from catching chills and colds, Locke suggests that "his ''feet to be washed'' every day in cold water, and to have his ''shoes'' so thin that they might leak and ''let in water'' whenever he comes near it" (Locke's emphasis).&lt;ref name="Locke, ''Some Thoughts'', 12."&gt;Locke, ''Some Thoughts'', 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Locke posited that if children were accustomed to having sodden feet, a sudden shower that wet their feet would not cause them to catch a cold. Such advice (whether followed or not) was quite popular; it appears throughout [[John Newbery]]'s children's books in the middle of the eighteenth century, for example, the first best-selling children's books in England.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in the "Preface" to ''A Little Pretty Pocket-Book'', Newbery recommended that parents feed their child a "common Diet only, cloath him thin, let him have good Exercise, and be as much exposed to Hardships as his natural Constitution will admit" because "the Face of a child, when it comes into the World, (says the great Mr. Locke) is as tender and susceptible of Injuries as any other Part of the Body; yet by being always exposed, it becomes Proof against the severest Season, and the most inclement Weather." ''A Little Pretty Pocket-Book, Intended for the Instruction and Amusement of Little Master Tommy, and Pretty Miss Polly''. 10th edition. London: Printed for J. Newbery (1760), 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Locke also offers specific advice on topics ranging from bed linens to diet to sleeping regimens.

===Virtue and reason===
Locke dedicates the bulk of ''Some Thoughts Concerning Education'' to explaining how to instill virtue in children. He defines virtue as a combination of self-denial and rationality: "that a man is able to ''deny himself'' his own desires, cross his own inclinations, and purely follow what reason directs as best, though the appetite lean the other way" (Locke's emphasis).&lt;ref&gt;Locke, ''Some Thoughts'', 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Future virtuous adults must be able not only to practice self-denial but also to see the rational path. Locke was convinced that children could reason early in life and that parents should address them as reasoning beings. Moreover, he argues that parents should, above all, attempt to create a "habit" of thinking rationally in their children.&lt;ref&gt;Yolton, ''Two Intellectual Worlds'', 31&amp;ndash;2.&lt;/ref&gt; Locke continually emphasises habit over rule—children should internalise the habit of reasoning rather than memorise a complex set of prohibitions. This focus on rationality and habit corresponds to two of Locke's concerns in the ''[[Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]''. Throughout the ''Essay'', Locke bemoans the irrationality of the majority and their inability, because of the authority of custom, to change or forfeit long-held beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Locke, ''Essay'', 89–91.&lt;/ref&gt; His attempt to solve this problem is not only to treat children as rational beings but also to create a disciplinary system founded on esteem and disgrace rather than on rewards and punishments.&lt;ref&gt;Yolton, ''Introduction'', 22&amp;ndash;4.&lt;/ref&gt; For Locke, rewards such as sweets and punishments such as beatings turn children into sensualists rather than rationalists; such sensations arouse passions rather than reason.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, ''Some Thoughts'', 34&amp;ndash;8.&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that "such a sort of ''slavish discipline'' makes a ''slavish temper''" (Locke's emphasis).&lt;ref&gt;Locke, ''Some Thoughts'', 34.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:LockeEssay.jpg|200px|thumb|left|alt=Page reads "An Essay Concerning Humane Understanding. In Four Books. Written by John Locke, Gent. The Fourth Edition, with large Additions. Eccles. XI. 5. As thou knowest not what is the way of the Spirit, nor how the bones do grow in the Womb of her that is with Child: even so thou knowest not the works of God, who maketh all things. Quam bellum est velle consteri potius nescire quod nescias, quam ista effutientum nauseare, atque ipsum sibi displicere! Cic. de Natur. Deor. l. I. London: Printed for Awasham and John Churchil, at the Black-Swan, in Pater-Noster-Row; and Samuel Manship, at the Ship in Cornhill, near the Royal Exchange, MDCC."|Title page from the fourth edition of ''[[Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'']]
What is important to understand is what exactly Locke means when he advises parents to treat their children as reasoning beings. Locke first highlights that children "love to be treated as Rational Creatures," thus parents should treat them as such. Tarcov argues that this suggests children can be considered rational only in that they respond to the desire to be treated as reasoning creatures and that they are "motivated only [by] rewards and punishments" to achieve that goal.&lt;ref&gt;Tarcov, 117&amp;ndash;8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, Locke wants children to become adults as quickly as possible. As he argues in ''Some Thoughts,'' "the only fence against the world is a thorough knowledge of it, into which a young gentleman should be entered by degrees as he can bear it, and the earlier the better."&lt;ref&gt;Locke, ''Some Thoughts'', 68.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Second Treatise on Government]]'' (1689), he contends that it is the parents' duty to educate their children and to act for them because children, though they have the ability to reason when young, do not do so consistently and are therefore usually irrational; it is the parents' obligation to teach their children to become rational adults so that they will not always be fettered by parental ties.&lt;ref&gt;Yolton, ''John Locke and Education'', 29–30; Yolton, ''Two Intellectual Worlds'', 34–37; Yolton, ''Introduction'', 36&amp;ndash;7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic curriculum===
Locke does not dedicate much space in ''Some Thoughts Concerning Education'' to outlining a specific curriculum; he is more concerned with convincing his readers that education is about instilling virtue and what Western educators would now call critical-thinking skills.&lt;ref&gt;Yolton, ''Introduction'', 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Locke maintains that parents or teachers must first teach children ''how'' to learn and to enjoy learning. As he writes, the instructor "should remember that his business is not so much to teach [the child] all that is knowable, as to raise in him a love and esteem of knowledge; and to put him in the right way of knowing and improving himself."&lt;ref&gt;Locke, ''Some Thoughts'', 195.&lt;/ref&gt; But Locke does offer a few hints as to what he thinks a valuable curriculum might be. He deplores the long hours wasted on learning [[Latin]] and argues that children should first be taught to speak and write well in their native language,&lt;ref&gt;Locke, ''Some Thoughts'', 143.&lt;/ref&gt; particularly recommending ''[[Aesop's Fables]]''.  Most of Locke's recommendations are based on a similar principle of utility.&lt;ref&gt;Bantock, G. H. "'The Under-labourer' in Courtly Clothes: Locke." ''Studies in the History of Educational Theory: Artifice and Nature, 1350–1765''. London: George Allen and Unwin (1980), 241.&lt;/ref&gt; So, for example, he claims that children should be taught to draw because it would be useful to them on their foreign travels (for recording the sites they visit), but poetry and music, he says, are a waste of time. Locke was also at the forefront of the [[scientific revolution]] and advocated the teaching of [[geography]], [[astronomy]], and [[anatomy]].&lt;ref&gt;Bantock, 240-2.&lt;/ref&gt; Locke's curricular recommendations reflect the break from [[scholasticism|scholastic]] [[humanism]] and the emergence of a new kind of education—one emphasising not only science but also practical professional training. Locke also recommended, for example, that every (male) child learn a trade.&lt;ref&gt;John Dunn, in his influential ''Political Thought of John Locke'', has interpreted this "calling" as a Calvinist religious doctrine. Tarcov has criticized this reading, however, writing: "Dunn’s exposition of the doctrine and its providentialist character is based on Puritan and secondary sources, and he gives no clear evidence for attributing it in this form to Locke." (Tarcov 127)&lt;/ref&gt; Locke's pedagogical suggestions marked the beginning of a new [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] ethos that would come to define [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Bantock, 244.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Class==
When Locke began writing the letters that would eventually become ''Some Thoughts on Education'', he was addressing an aristocrat, but the final text appeals to a much wider audience.&lt;ref&gt;Leites, Edmund. "Locke's Liberal Theory of Parenthood." ''Ethnicity, Identity, and History''. Eds. Joseph B. Maier and Chaim I. Waxman. New Brunswick: Transaction Books (1983), 69–70.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Locke writes: "I place ''Vertue'' [sic] as the first and most necessary of those Endowments, that belong to a Man or a Gentleman."&lt;ref&gt;Locke, ''Some Thoughts'', 102.&lt;/ref&gt; James Axtell, who edited the most comprehensive edition of Locke's educational writings, has explained that although "he was writing for this small class, this does not preclude the possibility that many of the things he said about education, especially its main principles, were equally applicable to ''all'' children" (Axtell's emphasis).&lt;ref&gt;Axtell, 52 and Yolton, ''John Locke and Education'', 30&amp;ndash;1.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a contemporary view as well; Pierre Coste, in his introduction in the first French edition in 1695, wrote, "it is certain that this Work was particularly designed for the education of Gentlemen: but this does not prevent its serving also for the education of all sorts of Children, of whatever class they are."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Axtell, 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

While it is possible to apply Locke's general principles of education to all children, and contemporaries such as Coste certainly did so, Locke himself, despite statements that may imply the contrary, believed that ''Some Thoughts'' applied only to the wealthy and the [[middle class|middle-class]] (or as they would have been referred to at the time, the "middling sorts"). One of Locke's conclusions in ''Some Thoughts Concerning Education'' is that he "think[s] a Prince, a Nobleman, and an ordinary Gentleman's Son, should have different Ways of Breeding."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Locke|first=John|title=Some thoughts concerning education|edition=13|date=1764|publisher=Printed for A. Millar, H. Woodfall, J. Wiston and B. White ...|location=London|page=324|url=https://archive.org/stream/13somethoughtscon00lockuoft#page/324/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Peter Gay writes, "[i]t never occurred to him that every child should be educated or that all those to be educated should be educated alike. Locke believed that until the school system was reformed, a gentleman ought to have his son trained at home by a tutor. As for the poor, they do not appear in Locke's little book at all."&lt;ref&gt;Gay, Peter. "Locke on the Education of Paupers." ''Philosophers on Education: Historical Perspectives''. Ed. Amélie Oksenberg Rorty. London: Routledge (1998), 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his "Essay on the Poor Law," Locke turns to the education of the poor; he laments that "the children of labouring people are an ordinary burden to the parish, and are usually maintained in idleness, so that their labour also is generally lost to the public till they are 12 or 14 years old."&lt;ref&gt;Locke, John. "An Essay on the Poor Law." ''Locke: Political Essays''. Ed. [[Mark Goldie]]. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press (1997), 190.&lt;/ref&gt; He suggests, therefore, that "working schools" be set up in each parish in England for poor children so that they will be "from infancy [three years old] inured to work."&lt;ref&gt;Locke, "Essay on the Poor Law," 190.&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on to outline the economics of these schools, arguing not only that they will be profitable for the parish, but also that they will instill a good work ethic in the children.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, "An Essay on the Poor Law," 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender==
Locke wrote ''Some Thoughts Concerning Education'' in response to his friend Samuel Clarke's query on how to educate his son, so the text's "principal aim", as Locke states at the beginning, "is how a young gentleman should be brought up from his infancy." This education "will not so perfectly suit the education of ''daughters''; though where the difference of sex requires different treatment, it will be no hard matter to distinguish" (Locke's emphasis).&lt;ref name="Locke, ''Some Thoughts'', 12."/&gt; This passage suggests that, for Locke, education was fundamentally the same for men and women—there were only small, obvious differences for women. This interpretation is supported by a letter he wrote to Mrs. Clarke in 1685 stating that "since therefore I acknowledge no difference of sex in your mind relating ... to truth, virtue and obedience, I think well to have no thing altered in it from what is [writ for the son]."&lt;ref&gt;Locke, John. "Letter to Mrs. Clarke, February 1685." ''The Educational Writings of John Locke''. Ed. James L. Axtell. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press (1968), 344.&lt;/ref&gt;  Martin Simons states that Locke "suggested, both by implication and explicitly, that a boy's education should be along the lines already followed by some girls of the intelligent genteel classes."&lt;ref&gt;Simons, 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than sending boys to schools which would ignore their individual needs and teach them little of value, Locke argues that they should be taught at home as girls already were and "should learn useful and necessary crafts of the house and estate."&lt;ref&gt;Simons, 140; see also Tarcov, 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Like his contemporary [[Mary Astell]], Locke believed that women could and should be taught to be rational and virtuous.&lt;ref&gt;Simons, 139 and 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

But Locke does recommend several minor "restrictions" relating to the treatment of the female body. The most significant is his reining in of female physical activity for the sake of physical appearance: "But since in your girls care is to be taken too of their beauty as much as health will permit, this in them must have some restriction ... 'tis fit their tender skins should be fenced against the busy sunbeams, especially when they are very hot and piercing."&lt;ref&gt;Locke, "Letter to Mrs. Clarke," 344.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Locke's statement indicates that he places a greater value on female than male beauty, the fact that these opinions were never published allowed contemporary readers to draw their own conclusions regarding the "different treatments" required for girls and boys, if any.&lt;ref&gt;Leites, 69–70.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, compared to other pedagogical theories, such as those in the best-selling conduct book ''The Whole Duty of a Woman'' (1696), the female companion to ''[[The Whole Duty of Man]]'' (1657), and Rousseau's ''[[Emile: Or, On Education|Emile]]'' (1762), which both proposed entirely separate educational programs for women, Locke's ''Some Thoughts'' appears far more egalitarian.

==Reception and legacy==
[[File:JohnLocke.png|right|200px|thumb|alt=Half-length portrait of a man with a shock of neck-length white hair who is wearing a loose brown robe and white shirt.|John Locke by [[Godfrey Kneller]] (1697)]]
Along with Rousseau's ''[[Emile: Or, On Education|Emile]]'' (1762), Locke's ''Some Thoughts Concerning Education'' was one of the foundational eighteenth-century texts on educational theory. In Britain, it was considered the standard treatment of the topic for over a century. For this reason, some critics have maintained that ''Some Thoughts Concerning Education'' vies with the ''[[Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' for the title of Locke's most influential work. Some of Locke's contemporaries, such as seventeenth-century German philosopher and mathematician [[Gottfried Leibniz]], believed this as well; Leibniz argued that ''Some Thoughts'' superseded even the ''Essay'' in its impact on European society.&lt;ref&gt;Ezell, 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

Locke's ''Some Thoughts Concerning Education'' was a runaway best-seller. During the eighteenth century alone, ''Some Thoughts'' was published in at least 53 editions: 25 English, 16 French, six Italian, three German, two [[Dutch language|Dutch]], and one [[Swedish language|Swedish]].&lt;ref&gt;Pickering, Samuel F., Jr. ''John Locke and Children's Books in Eighteenth-Century England''. Knoxville: The University of Tennessee Press (1981), 10; See Axtell 100–104 for a complete list of editions.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also excerpted in novels such as [[Samuel Richardson]]'s ''[[Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded|Pamela]]'' (1740–1), and it formed the theoretical basis of much children's literature, particularly that of the first successful children's publisher, [[John Newbery]]. According to James Secord, an eighteenth-century scholar, Newbery included Locke's educational advice to legitimise the new genre of children's literature. Locke's imprimatur would ensure the genre's success.&lt;ref&gt;Secord, James A. "Newton in the Nursery: Tom Telescope and the Philosophy of Tops and Balls, 1761–1838." ''History of Science'' 23 (1985), 132–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the eighteenth century, Locke's influence on educational thought was widely acknowledged. In 1772 James Whitchurch wrote in his ''Essay Upon Education'' that Locke was "an Author, to whom the Learned must ever acknowledge themselves highly indebted, and whose Name can never be mentioned without a secret Veneration, and Respect; his Assertions being the result of intense Thought, strict Enquiry, a clear and penetrating Judgment."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Pickering, 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Writers as politically dissimilar as [[Sarah Trimmer]], in her periodical ''[[The Guardian of Education]]'' (1802–06),&lt;ref&gt;Trimmer, Sarah. ''The Guardian of Education''. Bristol: Thoemmes Press (2002), 1:8–9, 108; 2:186–7; 4:74–5.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Maria Edgeworth]], in the educational treatise she penned with her father, ''[[Practical Education]]'' (1798), invoked Locke's ideas. Even Rousseau, while disputing Locke's central claim that parents should treat their children as rational beings, acknowledged his debt to Locke.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, ''Emile, or on Education''. Trans. Allan Bloom. New York: Basic Books (1979), 47 and 107&amp;ndash;25.&lt;/ref&gt;

John Cleverley and D. C. Phillips place Locke's ''Some Thoughts Concerning Education'' at the beginning of a tradition of educational theory which they label "environmentalism". In the years following the publication of Locke's work, [[Etienne Bonnot de Condillac]] and [[Claude Adrien Helvétius]] eagerly adopted the idea that people's minds were shaped through their experiences and thus through their education. Systems of teaching children through their senses proliferated throughout Europe. In Switzerland, [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]], relying on Locke's theories, developed the concept of the "object lesson."&lt;!--don't link; page is about something different--&gt; These lessons focused pupils' attention on a particular thing and encouraged them to use all of their senses to explore it and urged them to use precise words to describe it. Used throughout Europe and America during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, these object lessons, according to one of their practitioners "if well-managed, cultivate Sense-Perception, or Observation, accustom children to express their thoughts in words, increase their available stock of words and of ideas, and by thus storing material for thinking, also prepare the way for more difficult and advanced study."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in John Cleverley and D.C. Phillips, ''Visions of Childhood: Influential Models from Locke to Spock''. New York: Teachers College (1986), 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such techniques were also integral to [[Montessori method|Maria Montessori's]] methods in the twentieth century. According to Cleverley and Phillips, the television show [[Sesame Street]] is also "based on Lockean assumptions—its aim has been to give underprivileged children, especially in the inner cities, the simple ideas and basic experiences that their environment normally does not provide."&lt;ref&gt;Cleverley and Phillips, 26.&lt;/ref&gt; In many ways, despite Locke's continuing influence, as these authors point out, the twentieth century has been dominated by the "[[Nature versus nurture|nature vs. nurture]]" debate in a way that Locke's century was not. Locke's optimistic "environmentalism," though qualified in his text, is now no longer just a moral issue – it is also a scientific issue.&lt;ref&gt;Cleverley and Phillips, Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], a '''sophomore''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɑː|f|m|ɔr}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɒ|f|ə|m|ɔr}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sophomore|title=Sophomore - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary|publisher=|accessdate=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/american/sophomore|title=sophomore|publisher=|accessdate=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a student in the second year of study at [[high school]] or college.

==Education in the United States==

===High school===
The [[Education in the United States#School grades|10th grade]] is the second year of a student's [[High school#United States|high school]] period (usually aged 15–16) and is referred to as sophomore year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[How to Read a Book]]'', the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelean]] [[philosopher]] and founder of the "[[Great Books of the Western World]]" program [[Mortimer Adler]] says, "There have always been literate ignoramuses, who have read too widely, and not well. The Greeks had a name for such a mixture of learning and folly which might be applied to the bookish but poorly read of all ages. They are all 'sophomores.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Adler|first= Mortimer|date= 1972|title= How to Read a Book|publisher= Simon and Schuster|page= 11|isbn=0671212095}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High-school sophomores are expected to begin preparing for the college application process, including increasing and focusing their extracurricular activities. Students at this level are also considered to be developing greater ability for abstract thinking.&lt;ref name="washpost"&gt;{{cite news

===College/University===
In the United States, college sophomores are advised to begin thinking of career options and to get involved in volunteering or social organisations on or near campus.&lt;ref name="yale1"&gt;{{cite web

}} NB: In the US the term 'College' is used synonymously for 'University' whereas this is not the case in other English speaking countries.  A college was originally a society of scholars incorporated within, or in connection with, a University, or otherwise formed for purposes of study or instruction - however in the US where commonly only one college was formed then the terms became interchangeable.  In the UK where many Universities have more than one college and where there are colleges outside the University framework that do not always study to the same level the term is not interchangeable so should be used with care to avoid misunderstandings;  Everywhere else in the English speaking world 'University' is more commonly used.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Strahlendes Klima e.V''' is a registered [[non-profit organization]] that produces films and media focusing on the issues of energy and resources for an [[environmentally friendly]], more climate conscious world. Their main concept is to build a [[decentralised]] activist network in order to distribute topical content in terms of [[open licence]] publications. By offering free educational media they aim to raise awareness for environmental conservation.&lt;ref name="Educational media for German schools at Deutscher Bildungsserver"&gt;

== History ==
In late 2006 political scientist [[Kerstin Schnatz]] and cinematographer [[Isabel Huber]] began to research on uranium. They intended to do a documentary film focussing on the origins of nuclear power, especially the [[nuclear cycle]] and [[uranium mining]]. After having gathered a film crew of volunteers, the film was shot in Australia, France and Germany. In 2009 the international version of the documentary "Uranium - is it a country?" (53 min.) was released and nominated for the newcomer's award "Goldener Schlüssel" at [[Kasseler Dokumentarfilm- und Videofest]] in Germany.&lt;ref name="Dok-Fest Kassel 2009"&gt;
                      {{cite web
                      | url     = http://filmladen.de/dokfest_alt/alt/2009/programm-en/cview/269
                      | title   = Uranium - Is it a Country? - Eine Spurensuche nach der Herkunft von Atomstrom

                      }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film crew decided to distribute the documentary under an [[open licence]] model&lt;ref name="Uranium - is it a country? - Licence"&gt;
                      {{cite web
                      | url     = http://strahlendesklima.de/en/uranium/lizenz/

                      }}&lt;/ref&gt;
to spread the content. The film has been screened thousands of times all around the world due to its [[decentralised]] [[Film distributor|distribution]] coordinated by online networking activists.
It has been used heavily for political campaigning up to the [[German federal election]] in September 2009&lt;ref name="Screening Ludwigsburg"&gt;

In the summer of 2010 the film crew decided to found a [[non-profit organisation]] (Strahlendes Klima e.V.) to keep up the work on envirenmental issues.

== Activities ==

Strahlendes Klima e.V. helps activists to organize film screenings and debates on environmental issues.
They organise workshops for schools and non-profits and release educational films and media on a regular basis. In 2010 "At Eyelevel" their film about [[indigenous peoples]] facing the problems of uranium mining was released.

In 2011 [[Goethe Institut]]-Shanghai invited the organisation to visit [[China]]. A short film treating [[renewable energies]] in China is expected to be released in mid-2012.&lt;ref name="Projekt China"&gt;
                      {{cite web

They recently started the shooting of a new feature-length documentary on sustainable waste strategies, which will be available licensed under [[creative commons]] by 2013.

Within [[Higher education|higher-education]], '''Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowships (SURF)''' are a common summer immersion experience which supplement research activities that occur during the academic year. Typically, these highly competitive [[undergraduate]] programs are overseen by a member of a [[Faculty (university)|college's faculty]], who provide general guidance to the undergraduate's research work.  Areas of research vary widely, and can come from any art or science discipline.

Often, SURF participants are given a [[stipend]] to cover living expenses for the duration of the project.  SURF projects are also, more often than not, used for college credit, though this will vary according to the institution.

Many colleges give students the option to carry out a one or two semester senior research project, also under the SURF banner. Majors in a department follow a core of course requirements intended to gradually introduce students to the research process. By following this core, undergraduates reach their senior year adequately prepared for meaningful, independent research. A distinctive element of many SURF experiences is that the project results in a written thesis defended before a faculty panel in the presence of the department and students.

'''Tele-TASK''' is a university research project in the [[e-learning]] area. It can be applied to lecture recording, post-processing and distribution. Research topics include e-learning, tele-teaching, semantic web, video analysis, speech recognition, collaborative learning, social networking, web technologies, recommendation systems, statistics and video codecs and conversion.

The project was founded by [[Christoph Meinel]] and his research group at the [[University of Trier]]. When he accepted the chair for Internet Technologies and Systems&lt;ref name="Internet Technologies and Systems"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chair for Internet Technologies and Systems|url=http://hpi.de/meinel/chair/prof_dr_ch_meinel.html?L=1.|website=hpi.de|accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Hasso Plattner Institute]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Website of the Hasso Plattner Institute|url=http://hpi.de|website=hpi.de|accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[University of Potsdam]]/Germany, the tele-TASK project also moved with him.

Reference software was developed as proof of concept, such as an online e-lecture archive&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=E-Lecture archive of tele-TASK|url=http://www.tele-task.de|website=tele-task.de|accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[lecture recording]] system and a post-production tool.

Test anxiety can also be labeled as anticipatory anxiety, situational anxiety or evaluation anxiety. Some anxiety is normal and often helpful to stay mentally and physically alert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://brain.edusoft.ro/index.php/brain/article/view/131/260 | title=The Impact of Test Anxiety on Test Performance among Iranian EFL Learners |author1=Parviz Birjandi  |author2=Minoo Alemi  |lastauthoramp=yes | journal=BRAIN.

Inferior performance arises not because of intellectual problems or poor academic preparation, but because testing situations create a sense of threat for those experiencing test anxiety; anxiety resulting from the sense of threat then disrupts attention and memory function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sarason | first1 = I.G. | year = 1957 | title = Test anxiety, general anxiety, and intellectual performance | url = | journal = Journal of Consulting Psychology | volume = 21 | issue = 6| pages = 485–490 | doi=10.1037/h0043012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sarason | first1 = I.G. | year = 1959 | title = Intellectual and personality correlates of test anxiety | url = | journal = The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology | volume = 59 | issue = 2| pages = 272–275 | doi=10.1037/h0042200}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sarason | first1 = I.G. | year = 1963 | title = Test anxiety and intellectual performance | url = | journal = The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology | volume = 66 | issue = | pages = 73–75 | doi=10.1037/h0047059}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sarason, I.G.

==Signs and symptoms==

Researchers believe that feelings of anxiety arise to prepare a person for threats.&lt;ref name="DePhil"&gt;DePhil, M.B., Brilot, B., Nettle, D. (2011). Anxiety: An Evolutionary Approach. Canadian Journal of Psychiatry, 56(12):707-715&lt;/ref&gt; In humans, anxiety symptoms are distributed along a continuum and different symptom levels of anxiety predict outcomes. Responses consist of increased heart rate, stress hormone secretion, restlessness, vigilance, and fear of a potentially dangerous environment.&lt;ref name="DePhil"/&gt; Anxiety prepares the body physically, cognitively, and behaviourally to detect and deal with threats to survival. As a result, a person’s body begins to hyperventilate to allow more oxygen to enter the bloodstream, divert blood to muscles, and sweat to cool the skin.&lt;ref name="DePhil"/&gt; In  individuals, the degree to which an anxiety response is developed is based on the probability of bad things happening in the environment and the individual’s ability to cope with them. In the case of test taking, this might be a failing exam grade that prevents the student from being accepted to a post-secondary institution. A person's beliefs about their own competencies are a form of self-knowledge, which plays an important role in analyzing situations that might be threatening. When a person has feelings of low competence about their abilities they are likely to anticipate negative outcomes such as failure, under uncertain conditions. Thus, evaluative situations including tests and exams, are perceived as more threatening by students who have low competencies.&lt;ref name="Putwain"/&gt;

There is a difference between generalized anxiety disorders (GAD) and test anxiety. GAD is characterized by "trait anxiety" which results in a person experiencing high levels of stress across a wide range of situations. In contrast, people with test anxiety have a "state anxiety" which results in high levels of nervousness specific to testing.&lt;ref&gt;sady, J.C. (2010). Test anxiety: Contemporary theories and implications for learning. In J.C. Cassady (Ed.), Anxiety in schools: The causes, consequences, and solutions for academic anxieties (pp. 7-26). New York, NY: Peter Lang&lt;/ref&gt;

Symptoms of test anxiety can range from moderate to severe. "Students who exhibit moderate symptoms are still able to perform relatively well on exams. Other students with severe anxiety will often experience [[panic attacks]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cherry|first=Kendra|title=Test Anxiety Symptoms|url=http://psychology.about.com/od/mentalhealth/a/test-anxiety-symptoms.htm|work=The New York Times Company|accessdate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common physical symptoms include: headache, upset stomach, feeling of fear, feeling of dread, shortness of breath, sweating, pacing or fidgeting, crying, racing thoughts and blanking out.

During states of excitement or stress, the body releases [[adrenaline]]. Adrenaline is known to cause physical symptoms that accompany test anxiety, such as increased heart rate, sweating, and rapid breathing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lyness|first=D'Arcy|title=Test Anxiety|url= http://kidshealth.org/teen/school_jobs/school/test_anxiety.html|work=The Nemours Foundation.|accessdate=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases having adrenaline is a good thing. It is helpful when dealing with stressful situations, ensuring alertness and preparation.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen S., Kozlovsky N., Matar M.A., Kaplan Z., Zohar J. and Cohen H. (2012). Post-exposure sleep deprivation facilitates correctly-timed interactions between glucocorticoid and adrenergic systems which attenuate traumatic stress responses. ''Neuropsychopharmacology'' 37; 2388–2404&lt;/ref&gt; But for some people the symptoms are difficult or impossible to handle, making it impossible to focus on tests.

Test anxiety consists of:

*'''Physiological overarousal''' – often termed ''[[emotionality]]''.  [[Somatic symptom disorder|Somatic]] signs include headaches, stomach aches, nausea, diarrhea, excessive sweating, shortness of breath, light-headedness or fainting, rapid heartbeat and dry mouth. Test anxiety can also lead to panic attacks, in which the student may have a sudden intense fear, difficulty breathing, and extreme discomfort.
*'''Worry and dread''' – maladaptive cognitions. This includes catastrophic expectations of gloom and doom, fear of failure, random thoughts, feelings of inadequacy, self-condemnation, negative self-talk, frustration and comparing oneself unfavorably to others.
*'''Cognitive/Behavioral''' – poor concentration, "going blank" or "freezing," confusion, and poor organization.  The inability to concentrate leads to impaired performance on tests. Fidgeting during or outright avoidance of the test. Students often report "blanking out" even though they have studied sufficiently for the test.&lt;ref name="New York Times Company"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cherry|first=Kendra|title=Test Anxiety Symptoms|url=http://psychology.about.com/od/mentalhealth/a/test-anxiety-symptoms.htm|work=About.com|accessdate=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Emotional''' – low self-esteem, depression, anger, and a feeling of hopelessness.&lt;ref name="New York Times Company"/&gt;

==Causes==
Research shows that parental pressure is associated with greater worry, test irrelevant thoughts, and stronger bodily symptoms relating to anxiety during a test.&lt;ref name="Putwain"/&gt;

Other causes of test anxiety may include fear of failure, [[procrastination]], and previous poor test performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=ADAA|title=Test Anxiety|url=http://www.adaa.org/living-with-anxiety/children/test-anxiety|work=Anxiety Disorder Association of America|accessdate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well, characteristics of the test environment such as: nature of the task, difficulty, atmosphere, time constraints, examiner characteristics, mode of administration and physical setting can affect the level of anxiousness felt by the student.&lt;ref name= "Salend"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Putwain"/&gt; Researchers Putwain &amp; Best (2011),&lt;ref name="Best"&gt;Putwain D.W., Best, N. (2011). Fear appeals in the primary classroom: effects on test anxiety and test grade. Learning and Individual Differences, 21 580-584&lt;/ref&gt; examined test performance among elementary children when the teacher put pressure on the students in an attempt to create a more high stress environment. Their findings showed that students performed worse in high threat situations and experienced more test anxiety and worrisome thoughts than when in a low threat environment.

Test anxiety is known to develop into a vicious cycle. After experiencing test anxiety on one test, the student may become so fearful of it happening again they become more anxious and upset than they would normally, or even than they experienced on the previous test. If the cycle continues without acknowledgement, or the student seeking help, the student may begin to feel helpless in the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cherry|first=Kendra|title=Causes of Test Anxiety|url=http://psychology.about.com/od/mentalhealth/a/test-anxiety-causes.htm|work=The New York Times Company|accessdate=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People who experience test anxiety often have parents or siblings who have test anxiety or other types of anxiety. Anxiety does seem to have some genetic components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rodriguez|first=Diana|title=Overcoming College Anxiety|url=http://www.everydayhealth.com/college-health/overcoming-college-test-anxiety.aspx|work=Everyday Health|accessdate=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biological causes:

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; During times of stress the body releases a hormone called adrenaline that helps prepare for what is about to happen. Generally this adrenaline discharge is a good thing, but in some people the symptoms of nerves can be so strong that it does not allow them to concentrate on the tests.

Mental causes

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; In addition to the biological causes are the mental causes, one of the most influential is the students' expectations, if the student goes to the exam with the mentality that it will go wrong, is much more likely to feel anxiety before and during the exam which will lead to poor performance in the tests.

===Diagnosis===

Test anxiety can be diagnosed using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV, under the classification of ''social phobia.''&lt;ref name=McDonald /&gt;
Social phobias are characterized by ''a marked and persistent fear of social or performance situations in which embarrassment may occur''. In order to be diagnosed as suffering from a social phobia, the DSM-IV states that the individual must present four different factors.&lt;ref name=McDonald /&gt;

*Must show an immediate anxiety response when exposed to the feared social or performance situation.
*Must show various attempts to avoid social or performance situation, or sometimes endure it but with extreme fear. 
*Must experience a  disruption to normal activities due to the avoidance or fear associated with the situation
*Must have experienced the symptoms for at least six months.&lt;ref name=McDonald /&gt;

Other variables related to test anxiety are:

*[[Obsessive compulsive disorder]]s
*Perfectionist tendencies and unrealistic expectations
*Negative [[self-esteem]], self-statements, and criticism
*Poor motivation or lack of confidence
*[[Stereotype threat]]
*Inadequate study and test-taking skills
*Poor eating, sleeping and exercising habits&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Health, Exercise, Diet, Rest, Self-Image, Motivation, and Attitudes|url=http://www.muskingum.edu/~cal/database/general/physiopsyc.html|publisher=Muskingum College|accessdate=8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{additional citation needed |date=June 2016}}

==Theories==

Anxiety is defined as the "psychological mechanism whereby the current intensification of a dangerous drive results in the elicitation of defenses."&lt;ref&gt;Rosenwald, G.C (1961). The assessment of anxiety in psychological experimentation: a theoretical reformulation and test. Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 62(3): 666-673&lt;/ref&gt; George Mandler and Seymour Sarason (1952), developed the theory that anxiety present in testing situations is an important determinate of test performance.  Individuals that become highly anxious during tests typically perform more poorly on tests than low-test anxious persons, especially when tests are given under stressful evaluative conditions such as a post-secondary exam. The feelings of forgetfulness, or drawing a "blank" are developed because of anxiety-produced interference between relevant responses and irrelevant responses generated from the person’s anxious state. The difference in performance of a high-anxious test taker compared to a low-anxious test taker is largely due to the difference in their ability to focus on the tasks required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wine | first1 = J | year = 1971 | title = Test anxiety and direction of attention | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 76 | issue = 2| pages = 92–104 | doi=10.1037/h0031332| pmid = 4937878 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A low-anxious test taker is able to focus greater attention on the tasks required of them while taking the test, while a high-anxious test taker is focused on their internal self, and the anxiety they are feeling. Anxious test takers do not perform adequately on the test as their attention is divided between themselves and the test. Therefore, students with high test anxiety are unable to focus their full attention on the test. Furthermore, anxiousness is evoked when a student believes that the evaluative situation, such as an assessment, exceeds his or her intellectual, motivational, and social capabilities.&lt;ref name= "Putwain"&gt;Putwain, D.W., Woods, K.A., Symes, W. (2010). Personal and situational predictors of test anxiety of students in post-compulsory education. British Journal of Educational Psychology, 80, 137-160&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologists Liebert and Morris (1967) analyzed the structure of test anxiety given on two distinct factors: ''Cognitive Test Anxiety'' and ''Emotionality''.&lt;ref name="Cassady &amp; Johnson" /&gt; '''''Emotionality''''' means that the individual shows high levels of several different symptoms related to test anxiety that can be seen through physiological responses experienced during situations where they are being evaluated; such as an exam.&lt;ref name="Cassady &amp; Johnson" /&gt; Some of the physiological manifestations include: increased galvanic skin response and heart rate, dizziness, nausea, or feelings of panic.&lt;ref name="Cassady &amp; Johnson" /&gt; There is evidence that emotionality is a distinct part of test anxiety; however, it can be seen that when an individual displays high emotionality it means that it is mostly associated with declining performance, but only when the individual is also experiencing high levels of worry.&lt;ref name="Cassady &amp; Johnson" /&gt;

The other factor mentioned is '''''Cognitive Test Anxiety''''', also known as worry. It is mostly composed of the individuals cognitive reactions to situations where they are being evaluated, in the times prior to, during, and after those tasks.&lt;ref name="Cassady &amp; Johnson" /&gt; Some of the thoughts that individuals with high cognitive test anxiety are constantly dealing with are comparing self performance to peers, considering the consequences of failure, low levels of confidence in performance, excessive worry about grades, feeling that they are unprepared for tests, and loss of self-worth.&lt;ref name="Cassady &amp; Johnson" /&gt;

Researchers Putwain, Woods &amp; Symes (2010), found that a low academic self-concept was associated with higher worry and tension about their abilities to do well on a test. A student's metacognitive beliefs play an important role in the maintenance of negative self-beliefs.&lt;ref name="Putwain"/&gt;

Anxiety reactions can be generalized from previous experiences to testing situations.&lt;ref&gt;Mandler, G. &amp; Sarson, S. B. (1952). A study of anxiety and learning. Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 47, 166-173&lt;/ref&gt; Feelings of inadequacy, helplessness, anticipations of punishment or loss of status and esteem manifest anxiety responses. As well, the presence of an audience can debilitate the performance of high anxious test takers and increase the performance of low anxious test takers. Persons who score high on anxiety scales tend to describe themselves in negative, self-devaluing terms. Highly anxious test takers also blame themselves for their failure significantly more than low anxious test takers.

The study of the relationship between  anxiety and performance can be understood by using the '''Yerkes-Dodson Law,''' where one can see the facilitating and debilitating effects of arousal on performance as an inverted "U".&lt;ref name=McDonald /&gt; 
An example of this correlation can be seen in terms of a child taking a test where the degree of arousal or anxiety that the child portrays can be seen as beneficial to the performance. Though, if the child doesn't have a feeling or fear or failure or some sort of encouragement to perform well on the test, then the child is unlikely to put the necessary effort into preparing or being motivated when taking the test and so he or she will not perform to their fullest potential.&lt;ref name=McDonald /&gt;

However, if before or during a test a child's level of anxiety is above the optimum level, they may also fail to demonstrate their true abilities.&lt;ref name=McDonald /&gt; Under these circumstances fear of the actual test may disrupt preparation and cause a great amount of distress during the test that it is more than likely to impair their performance.&lt;ref name=McDonald /&gt;

===Attentional theories===
There are two main groups of attentional theories that attempt to explain compromised performance in pressured situations.&lt;ref name = DeCaro&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://hpl.uchicago.edu/Publications/Choking%20Under%20Pressure%20Multiple%20Routes%20to%20Skill%20Failure.pdf | title=Choking under pressure: multiple routes to skill failure. |vauthors=DeCaro MS, Thomas RD, Albert NB, Beilock SL | journal=J Exp Psychol Gen |date=August 2011 | volume=140 | issue=3 | pages=390–406 | doi=10.1037/a0023466| pmid=21574739 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One group of theories are the ''explicit monitoring theories''. They state that when a person is expected to perform a specific skill, the pressure may cause an increased self-consciousness and inward focus, which can disrupt their ability to successfully perform that task.&lt;ref name = interplay/&gt; Thinking about step-by-step procedures can inhibit one’s ability to execute a task.&lt;ref name = DeCaro/&gt; For example, a study by R. Gray found that baseball players put into the high-pressure condition had increased errors, and an increased ability to recall details like the direction their bat was moving.  This indicates that the pressured players were monitoring themselves more, which impacted their ability to successfully hit the ball.&lt;ref name = DeCaro/&gt;

A second group of theories are the ''distraction theories''. These theories states that high-pressure environments create a dual-task situation, in which the person’s attention is divided between the task at hand and unhelpful thoughts about the situation and possible negative consequences of poor performance.&lt;ref name = interplay&gt;[http://home.uchicago.edu/ramirezg/CH05.pdf On the interplay of emotion and cognitive control: Implications for enhancing academic achievement.]  Beilock, Sian L. Ramirez, Gerardo ; In: The psychology of learning and motivation (Vol 55): Cognition in education. Mestre, Jose P. (Ed.); Ross, Brian H. (Ed.); San Diego, CA, US: Elsevier Academic Press, Vol 55, 2011. pp. 140-141&lt;/ref&gt; 
Attention is an important part of [[working memory]],&lt;ref name = interplay/&gt; which is the system that actively holds several pieces of relevant information in the mind while inhibiting irrelevant information.&lt;ref name = interplay/&gt; Working memory has a limited capacity, and the addition of stress and anxiety reduces the resources available to focus on relevant information.&lt;ref name = Revlin&gt;Revlin, Russell. Cognition: Theory and Practice. New York, NY: Worth, 2013. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In situations in which individuals need to concentrate their attention on a specific task, emotional stimuli can divert their attention to a greater degree than non-emotional stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3192286/pdf/nihms318701.pdf | title=Attentional capture by emotional stimuli is preserved in patients with amygdala lesions | author=Richard M.

Zald | journal=Neuropsychologia |date=October 2011 | volume=49 | issue=12 | pages=3314–3319 | doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2011.08.004 | pmc=3192286 | pmid=21884712}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emotional stimuli will often dominate a person’s thoughts, and any attempt to suppress them will require additional working memory resources.&lt;ref name = Revlin/&gt; When working memory divides resources between the aversive cognitions and the task-relevant material, then the person’s ability to use the relevant information on a test will suffer.&lt;ref name = Mowbray&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/edp.2012.16|title=Working Memory, Test Anxiety and Effective Interventions: A Review|journal=The Australian Educational and Developmental Psychologist|volume=29|issue=2|pages=141–156|year=2012|last1=Mowbray|first1=Tony}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People who suffer from test anxiety are more likely to experience negative cognitions while in evaluative situations. Furthermore, test anxious persons have been found to bias their attention towards threatening and anxiety related stimuli more than nonemotional stimuli.&lt;ref name = Baddeley2013&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/a0030029|title=Working memory and emotion: Ruminations on a theory of depression|journal=Review of General Psychology|volume=17|pages=20–27|year=2013|last1=Baddeley|first1=Alan|citeseerx=10.1.1.400.9070}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Research has accordingly found that tasks that rely heavily on working memory are the ones that suffer the most during pressure.&lt;ref name = interplay/&gt; Shortfalls in performance that are caused by test anxiety seem to be related to the extent to which the student has full access to their [[working memory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Test anxiety and Working Memory | author=Ju Hyun Lee | journal=Journal of Experimental Education | year=1999 | volume=67 | issue=3 | pages=218–240 | doi=10.1080/00220979909598354|jstor = 20152597}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When comparing these two theories in the context of academic performance, a majority of work supports distraction theories.&lt;ref name = interplay/&gt; One reason for this is that many of the skills performed in the classroom require heavy demands on working memory.&lt;ref name = interplay/&gt; However, there are different kinds of pressure situations. There is ''monitoring pressure'', in which an individual’s performance is impacted due to the presence of an audience, and ''outcome pressure'', in which an individual’s performance is influenced by the consequences of the testing results.&lt;ref name = DeCaro/&gt; In a study, DeCaro ''et al.'' found that performance on a rule-based task, that relies heavily on working memory, was impaired by outcome pressure, but not monitoring pressure, whereas performance on an information-integration task, which does not require attentional control, was hurt by monitoring pressure, but not outcome pressure.&lt;ref name = DeCaro/&gt; These findings indicate that  performance is compromised in different ways depending on the type of task, and the types of pressure, and that both theories can be correct.&lt;ref name = DeCaro/&gt;

====Attentional control====
[[File:Baddley's Model of Working Memory.png|thumbnail|Schematic of the four elements of Baddeley's model of working memory.]]
[[Michael Eysenck|Eysenck]] ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;Eysenck, M. W., Santos, R., Derekshan, N., &amp; Calvo, M. G. (2007). Anxiety and cognitive performance: Attentional Control Theory. Emotion, 7(2), 336–352.&lt;/ref&gt; elaborate upon the distraction theories and propose the attentional control theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.k-state.edu/psych/research/documents/Rai_et_al_2010-online_Effects_of_Stress_and_WM_Capacity_on_FL_Readers_Inferential_Proc_Durin.pdf | title=Effects of Stress and Working Memory Capacity on Foreign Language Readers' Inferential Processing During Comprehension |author1=Manpreet K. Rai |author2=Lester C. Loschky |author3=Richard Jackson Harris |author4=Nicole R. Peck |author5=Lindsay G. Cook | journal=Language Learning |date=March 2011 | volume=61 | issue=1 | pages=187–218 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9922.2010.00592.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory uses [[Baddeley's model of working memory]] to explain the effects of anxiety on working memory and on performance.&lt;ref name = Derakshan/&gt; In Baddeley's theory, working memory (WM) consists of four components, one of them the [[central executive]] that has a number of tasks such as coordination of the temporary stores of phonological and visual information ([[phonological loop]] and [[visuospatial sketchpad]], respectively).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S1364-6613(00)01538-2 | last1 = Baddeley | first1 = A.D. | year = 2000 | title = The episodic buffer: A new component of working memory? | url = | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 4 | issue = 11| pages = 417–423 | pmid=11058819}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attentional control theory assumes that anxiety primarily affects attentional control, which is a key function of the central executive.&lt;ref name = Derakshan/&gt; Attentional control is the balance between the two attentional systems, the ''goal-directed system'', influenced by the individual's goals, and the ''stimulus-driven system'', influenced by salient stimuli.&lt;ref name = Derakshan/&gt; According to the attentional control theory, anxiety disrupts the balance between these two systems. The stimulus-driven system becomes stronger at the expense of the goal-directed system, thereby impairing the efficiency of the inhibition and shifting functions of the central executive.&lt;ref name = Derakshan/&gt;

In support of this theory, there is strong evidence that anxiety largely impairs processing efficiency rather than performance effectiveness.&lt;ref name = Derakshan&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1027/1016-9040.14.2.168|title=Anxiety, Processing Efficiency, and Cognitive Performance|journal=European Psychologist|volume=14|issue=2|pages=168–176|year=2009|last1=Derakshan|first1=Nazanin|last2=Eysenck|first2=Michael W.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Performance effectiveness refers to the quality of performance whereas processing efficiency refers to the amount of resources used to attain an effective performance.&lt;ref name = Derakshan/&gt; There is also evidence that anxiety impairs both the inhibition and the shifting function.&lt;ref name = Derakshan/&gt; Therefore, this theory suggests that students high in test anxiety will have to allocate more resources to the task at hand than non-test anxiety students in order to achieve the same results.&lt;ref name = Mowbray/&gt;

In general, people with higher working memory capacity do better on academic tasks, but this changes when people are under acute pressure.&lt;ref name = interplay/&gt; [[Sian Beilock]] ''et al.'' found that pressure led individuals with a high working memory capacity to perform worse on a complicated task, whereas individuals with a low WM capacity got the same low results with or without pressure. This was because people with high WM could use more better but more demanding problem solving strategies in the low pressure condition, which they had to abandon in the high pressure condition. The low WM people never used these demanding strategies in the first place.&lt;ref name = interplay/&gt; Evidence for similar working memory effects in children has also been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi= 10.1111/bjep.12027 | last1 = Wang | first1 = Z. | year = 2013 | title = The effect of pressure on high- and low-working-memory students: An elaboration of the choking under pressure hypothesis | url = | journal = British Journal of Educational Psychology| volume =  84| issue = 2| pages = 1–13 | pmid=24164334}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence that trait anxiety might have different effects on working memory than state or acute pressure situations comes from Johnson ''et al.'' who found individuals' performances on a task showed a decrease in accuracy due to trait anxiety for individuals with low or average WM capacity, but did not significantly decrease for individuals with high WM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/10615800802291277|pmid=18785033|title=Individuals lower in working memory capacity are particularly vulnerable to anxiety's disruptive effect on performance|journal=Anxiety, Stress &amp; Coping|volume=22|issue=2|pages=201–213|year=2009|last1=Johnson|first1=Dan R.|last2=Gronlund|first2=Scott D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement scales==

Early scales, by authors such as [[Charles Spielberger]], tended to focus on physiological and somatic features and on worry, commonly referred to as ''emotionality'',&lt;ref&gt;cf Charles Spielberger&lt;/ref&gt; while more recent offerings, such as that by Cassady &amp; Johnson, emphasize cognitive processes.&lt;ref name="Cassady2001"&gt;Cassady, J. &amp; Johnson, R. (2001). Cognitive test anxiety and academic performance. Contemporary Educational Psychology, 27, 270–295.&lt;/ref&gt; "Test anxiety" for these authors consists of physiological and mental processes, and impaired test performance is seen as the result.

The ''Children's Test Anxiety Questionnaire'' is specifically designed to measure test anxiety in children 8–12 years of age. It provides scores for three dimensions of test anxiety: "worrisome thoughts concerning failure (i.e. 'when I take tests, I worry about failing'), automatic reactions concerning students' general and specific somatic indications of anxiety (i.e. 'when I take tests, my heart beats fast'), and off-task behaviours concerning nervous habits and distracting behaviours (i.e. 'when I take tests, I play with my pencil')" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/10615800412331292606|title=Measuring test anxiety in children: Scale development and internal construct validation|journal=Anxiety, Stress &amp; Coping|volume=17|issue=3|pages=227–240|year=2004|last1=Wren|first1=Douglas G.|last2=Benson|first2=Jeri}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Test Anxiety Inventory for Children and Adolescent'' (TAICA) is a way to measure and assess test anxiety in children and adolescents in Grades 4 through 12. Those individuals who are being assessed rate their responses on a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (never true about me) to 5 (always true about me). The TAICA is a 45-item self-report measure which consists of four sub scales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lowe|first1=Patricia A.|last2=Lee|first2=Steven W.|last3=Witteborg|first3=Kristin M.|last4=Prichard|first4=Keri W.|last5=Luhr|first5=Megan E.|last6=Cullinan|first6=Christopher M.|last7=Mildren|first7=Bethany A|last8=Raad|first8=Jennifer M.|last9=Cornelius|first9=Rebecca A.|last10=Janik|first10=Melissa|title=Examination of the Psychometric Properties of a New Multidimensional Measure of Test Anxiety Among Elementary and Secondary School Students|journal=Psychoeducational Assessment|date=September 2008|volume=26|issue=3|pages=215–230|doi=10.1177/0734282907303760}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Cognitive Obstruction/Inattention subscale assesses memory and attention difficulties and obstructed cognitions associated with test anxiety
*Physiological Hyperarousal subscale measures physical symptoms associated with the test-taking process.
*Social Humiliation subscale measures fear associated with failing a test and being belittled or ridiculed by significant others
*Worry subscale assesses negative thoughts and worries that adversely affect test performance.

==Treatment ==
Medication is not recommended to treat test anxiety; instead, standard suggestions include sleep, proper nutrition, exercise, meditation, studying without stress, and enacting habits to reduce stress during the test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sawchuk |first1=Craig |title=Test anxiety: Can it be treated? |url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/generalized-anxiety-disorder/expert-answers/test-anxiety/faq-20058195 |website=Mayo Clinic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Downs |first1=Cecilia |title=Managing Test Anxiety |url=https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/support/counseling-and-psychological-services/index.php?q=managing-test-anxiety |website=Brown University Counseling and Psychological Services}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Management===
To gain an accurate assessment of student comprehension, instructors should be concerned with minimizing the effects of test anxiety. Instructors might offer "second chances" post test, familiarize students with test format and grading scheme, and lower the impact of any one test.&lt;ref&gt;Wilbert J. Mckeachie and Marilla Svinicki's "Teaching Tips" 12th edition, pg. 110;&lt;/ref&gt; If students have greater confidence in their test-taking skills, they are more likely to be comfortable and relaxed when the testing does occur. Having an intentional thinking strategy should help student performance improve.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

For some individuals, poor academic performance is due to skill deficits, which could include problems in encoding (learning),rehearsal (study skills) or retrieval during a test (test-taking strategies).&lt;ref&gt;Damer, D.E., Melendres, L.T (2011). Tackling Test Anxiety: A groups for college students. The Journal for Specialists in Group Work, 36(3):163-177&lt;/ref&gt; Skill deficits may lead to poor performance directly (failure to adequately learn the material) or indirectly (awareness of being ill-prepared causes anxiety that, in turn, leads to poor performance). Therefore, the most effective interventions are those that combine skill-focused strategies (i.e. study skills training, test-taking skills) with cognitive (i.e. cognitive restructuring) or behavioural approaches (i.e. relaxation training, systematic desensitization).&lt;ref&gt;Ergene, T. (2003). Effective interventions on test anxiety reduction. School Psychology International, 24, 313–328&lt;/ref&gt; 

Students also need to stay healthy in order to be able to deal with stress and anxiety. They need to eat healthy, and get enough sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/eating-well-to-help-manage-anxiety-your-questions-answered-2018031413460|title=Eating well to help manage anxiety: Your questions answered - Harvard Health Blog|last=MD|first=Uma Naidoo,|date=2018-03-14|work=Harvard Health Blog|access-date=2018-10-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Thomas Jefferson Education''''', also known as "TJEd"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/sections/i_video/main500251.shtml?id=3917028n |title=Three Ways to Home School |aboom boom pow.pages= |language= |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or "Leadership Education" is a philosophy and methodology of education which is popular among some alternative educators, including private schools, charter schools and homeschoolers. It is based on the Seven Keys of Great Teaching and the Phases of Learning. This educational paradigm was popularized through the writing and teaching of [[Oliver DeMille |Oliver and Rachel DeMille]], co-authors of the TJEd resource materials. TJED is the reestablishment of a classical Liberal Arts Education based on the education of the founding American era and other classic periods on history.

==Seven Keys of Great Teaching==
In TJEd, the "Seven Keys of Great Teaching" are Classics, not Textbooks; Mentors, not Professors; Inspire, not Require; Structure Time, not Content; Quality, not Conformity; Simplicity, not Complexity; and You, not Them.

==Phases of Leadership Education==
TJEd prescribes a distinct approach for students of different developmental ages. These are called "Phases", and correspond with the physical/emotional/intellectual readiness for the lessons of each phase.  The suggested corresponding ages are a general guide, with exceptions that vary widely.  DeMille cites such developmental psychologists as [[Jean Piaget]], [[Lev Vygotsky]] and [[Erik Erikson]] in support of their paradigm of "Phases".&lt;ref&gt;DeMille, Oliver and Rachel, ''Leadership Education: The Phases of Learning'', 2008; Chapter One: "Two Views of Childhood"; {{ISBN|978-0-9671246-4-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foundational Phases===
The "Foundational Phases" of TJEd are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;DeMille, Oliver and Rachel, ''Leadership Education: The Phases of Learning'', 2008; Chapter 3-6; {{ISBN|978-0-9671246-4-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Core (birth to 8+ years of age): right and wrong, good and bad, true and false, relationships, family values, family routines and responsibilities, learning accountability, and the value and love of work.
*Love of Learning (about 8 to 12 years of age): encourages family reading of classic literature, project learning, clubs and "Momschools" are among the elements that help inspire the youngster to love learning and to approach a variety of subjects with interest and growing levels of competence and diligence. The lessons of "Love of Learning" Phase: What's out there to learn? You're responsible for personal decisions. Personal accountability. Learning your gifts, interests, life's goals, mission. And the importance of home and family.

===Educational Phases===
The "Educational Phases" are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;DeMille, Oliver and Rachel, ''Leadership Education: The Phases of Learning'', 2008; Chapter 7-8; {{ISBN|978-0-9671246-4-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Scholar (approximately 12 to 18 years of age): adolescent students study long hours and work with a mentor to refine their academic skills—the emphasis placed on cultural literacy and a personalized approach to studies.
*Depth (approximately 18 to 24 years of age): students submit to a mentor-guided program, whether privately or in a formal college setting or a "mission". The seven lessons of depth phase: 1. Initiative 2. Ingenuity 3. Allegiance 4. Integrity 5. Commitment 6. Passion 7. Impact

===Applicational Phases===
The "Applicational [sic] Phases" are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;DeMille, Oliver and Rachel, ''Leadership Education: The Phases of Learning'', 2008; Chapter 9-10; {{ISBN|978-0-9671246-4-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Mission (approximately 25 to 45 years of age): the individual continues in self-education as he or she builds family and community through professional vocations, entrepreneurship, social leadership or some other focus. 
*Impact (approximately 45 to 65 years of age, and beyond): the individual asserts leadership on a broader scale as an "elder" in society, acting as a mentor, philosopher, philanthropist, artist, community leader and generational elder in the family.

The books note that while the above timeline is in some respects ideal, it is possible to "renegotiate" lost lessons from previous phases, and "catch up" to the natural flow of the Phases.&lt;ref&gt;DeMille, Oliver and Rachel, ''Leadership Education: The Phases of Learning'', 2008; pp. 32-33; {{ISBN|978-0-9671246-4-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==5 Pillar Certification==
TJEd parents and educators wanting an introduction to teaching through the classics can receive orientation and training to do so by completing The Five Pillar Certification. The Five Pillars of Statesmanship are: Classics, Mentors, Simulations, Field Experience and God. Certification endorses an individual’s knowledge and ability in the Classics/Mentors approach to teaching leaders by incorporating all Five Pillars into an overall system of education. The 5 Pillar Certification program is divided into three levels to facilitate progress. 

Level I is an introduction to the Five Pillars and the Classics/Mentors model of education includes attending a seminar, submitting a form to a facilitator, and reading and discussing the following books: ''[[The Chosen (Potok novel)|The Chosen]]'', ''[[Jane Eyre]]'', ''[[The Lonesome Gods]]'', ''[[Little Britches]]'', ''[[Laddie (novel)|Laddie]]'', ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'', and ''A Thomas Jefferson Education''.

Level II is a comprehensive study of additional classics. It also requires seminar attendance and a reading and one-page summary for 12 of the following books: ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'', "What is Seen and What is Not Seen" from ''[[Essays on Political Economy]]'', ''[[The One Minute Teacher]]'', ''[[The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People]]'', ''Leadership Education: The Phases of Learning'', ''[[Great Expectations]]'', ''[[Alas, Babylon]]'', ''[[Multiple Intelligences]]'', "The 7 Lesson School Teacher" from ''[[Dumbing Us Down]]'', ''[[Market-Based Education]]'', ''[[How Children Learn]]'', ''[[Les Misérables]]'', ''[[Spiritual Lives of the Great Composers]]'', ''[[The Abolition of Man]]'', ''[[Understanding the Times]]'', ''[[Uncle Tom’s Cabin]]'', ''[[The Fourth Turning]]'', ''[[Walden]]'', and ''[[The Virginian (novel)|The Virginian]]''.

Level III is considered a practical application of the Five Pillars in an educational setting. One must administrate or teach in a public, private or home school or class and apply the 5 Pillar system for a minimum of six months; keep a journal of the entire project and write a project summary when the project is complete; pass an oral board covering the content of the three levels, as well as the practicum; and attend a seminar.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5531">A '''three-part lesson''' is an [[inquiry-based learning]] method used to teach mathematics in [[K–12 (education)|K–12]] schools.

The three-part lesson has been attributed to John A. Van de Walle, a mathematician at [[Virginia Commonwealth University]].&lt;ref name="Van"&gt;{{cite web | last = Van de Walle | first = John A. | title = Reform Mathematics vs. The Basics: Understanding the Conflict and Dealing with It | publisher = Mathematically Sane | date = April 1, 2003 | url = http://mathematicallysane.com/reform-mathematics-vs-the-basics/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="John"&gt;{{cite web | title = John Van de Walle Biography | publisher = National Council of Teachers of Mathematics | url = http://www.nctm.org/resources/content.aspx?id=25082 | accessdate = September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components==
===Getting started phase (10 to 15 minutes)===
The purpose is to cognitively prepare students for the math lesson by having them think about a procedure, strategy or concept used in a prior lesson.  Teachers determine what specific previous learning they wish students to recall, based on outcomes desired for that particular lesson.&lt;ref name="Sketch"&gt;{{cite web | title = Sketch of a Three-Part Lesson | publisher = Ontario College of Teachers | date = March 2010 | url = http://professionallyspeaking.oct.ca/march_2010/features/lesson_study/three-part.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The role of the teacher is to "get students mentally prepared to work on the problem".&lt;ref name="Van"/&gt;

[[Marian Small]], a proponent of a [[constructivist teaching methods|constructivist]] approach to mathematical instruction, provides an example of an inquiry-based question from which a three-part lesson could be created: "one bus has 47 students in it; another has 38. How many students are on both buses?"&lt;ref name="small-2"&gt;{{cite web | last = Small | first = Marian | title = How Students Learn Math and What Math We Want Them to Learn | publisher = Cengage Learning | date = 2012 | url = http://www.nelsonbrain.com/content/9780176643461.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Work phase (30 to 40 minutes)===
Students engage in solving math problems individually, in pairs, or in small groups, and "record the mathematical thinking they used to develop solutions".  Students then plan the strategies, methods, and concrete materials they will use to solve the problem.  The teacher will circulate and make observations about the ways students are interacting, and will note the mathematical language they are using as well as the mathematical models they are employing to solve the problem.  If a student is having difficulty, "the teacher might pose questions to provoke further thinking or have other students explain their plan for solving the problem".&lt;ref name="Sketch"/&gt;  Teachers are advised to be active listeners in this phase, and to take notes.  This is also a phase in which teachers can assess students.&lt;ref name="Van"/&gt;  

===Consolidation and practice phase (10 to 15 minutes)===
In this final phase, the teacher oversees the sharing of solutions by students, and may employ other teaching techniques such as "math congress", "gallery walk", or "bansho".  If new methods and strategies were discovered by students during the work phase, the teacher will post these on the class's "strategy wall", or use them to develop an "anchor chart".&lt;ref name="Sketch"/&gt;  Teachers are not to evaluate students in this phase, but should be actively listening "to both good and not so good ideas".&lt;ref name="Van"/&gt; 

==Effectiveness==
Advocates of the three-part lesson state that students develop "independence and confidence by choosing the methods, strategies and concrete materials they will use, as well as ways to record their solutions".  They claim students learn to discern similarities and differences in the mathematics, and also that "through such rich mathematics classroom discourse, students develop and consolidate their understanding of the learning goal of the lesson in terms of making connections to prior knowledge and experiences and making generalizations".&lt;ref name="Sketch"/&gt;  Advocates also claim "students are more enthusiastic about the subject" when inquiry-based math instruction is used.&lt;ref name="Alphonso"&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Alphonso | first1 = Caroline | last2 = Morrow | first2 =   Adrian | title = Ontario Teachers Need Better Math Training, Minister Says | publisher = Globe and Mail | date = August 28, 2013 | url = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/education/ontario-testing-shows-dip-in-student-math-skills-for-fifth-year-in-a-row/article13996303/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of inquiry-based methods such as the three-part lesson state that students are not learning the basics such as multiplication tables.  In Ontario, Canada, where the [[Ministry of Education (Ontario)|Ministry of Education]]  has promoted the three-part lesson, the curriculum was changed in the late 1990s in favour of "problem solving based on open-ended investigations rather than memorization".  In that province, test scores in grades three and grade six math declined between 2009 and 2013, and "some contend that the math curriculum rather than teacher education is to blame for the lower scores because it places more emphasis on real-world concepts and applications than on rote learning".&lt;ref name="Alphonso"/&gt;

'''Underground education''', or '''clandestine education''' refers to various practices of teaching carried out at times and places where such educational activities were deemed illegal.

Examples of places where widespread clandestine education practices took place included [[Education during the Slave Period|education of Blacks during the Slave Period in the USA]]&lt;ref name="PlatoSigler1997"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Plato|author2=Julius A.

There is a Greek - mostly oral - tradition claiming that secret schools (''[[Krifo scholio]]'') operated during the Ottoman period. There is scant written evidence for this and many historians view it as a [[national myth]]. Others believe that the Greek secret school is a [[legend]] with a core of truth. According to certain sources, secret schools for Albanians operated in late 19th century by Albanian-speaking communities and [[Bektashi Order|Bektashi]] priests under Ottoman rule.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.gr/books?id=0JqPscM-kcYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=el&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=secret%20schools&amp;f=false Selçuk Akşin Somel, The Modernization of Public Education in the Ottoman Empire, 1839-1908.

In Lithuania, clandestine schools (''Slaptoji mokykla'') operated almost in every village, at the end of 19th and beginning of 20th century, because of the suppresion of Lithuanian language by the tsarist Russian government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journals.vu.lt/psichologija/article/view/9273 K.

Secret schooling was organized in Jewish Ghettos during the Nazi regime and the German occupation in Europe. During the Taliban rule in various parts of Afghanistan (late 20th, early 21st c.), secret schools operated, mostly for women and girls.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/oct/01/afghanistan.theobserver Afghan girls risk their lives to go to secret school, ''The Guardian''.

Japanese and other foreign schools, languages and printed material were restricted, and a compulsory assimilation program was instituted. Japanese schools became illegal in 1938. During that period, Japanese immigrants established secret schools and a newspaper in japanese was printed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.gr/books?id=7nlxybOVae8C&amp;pg=PT37&amp;lpg=PT37&amp;dq=clandestine+schools+japan&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_0QKHmY6aS&amp;sig=namFzr22cZmwX-H0mWHEbzI_MQs&amp;hl=el&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiK3tuU24XaAhVH2aQKHZx7B-0Q6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=clandestine%20schools%20japan&amp;f=false  Daniela de Carvalho, Migrants and Identity in Japan and Brazil: The Nikkeijin.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12590">A '''WebQuest''' is an [[Inquiry-based learning|inquiry-oriented lesson]] format in which most or all the information that learners work with comes from the [[World Wide Web|web]].&lt;ref name="webquest_home"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webquest.org |title=WebQuest.org |publisher=Department of Educational Technology, San Diego State University.  |year=2008 |accessdate=2012-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These can be created using various [[Computer program|program]]s, including a simple [[word processing]] document that includes [[Hyperlink|link]]s to [[website]]s.

==Distinguishing characteristics==
A WebQuest is distinguished from other Internet-based research by four characteristics.  First, it is classroom-based.&lt;ref name=wqexplanation&gt;{{cite web |title=WebQuests Explanation |url=http://www.thirteen.org/edonline/concept2class/webquests/index.html|work=Concept to Classroom Workshop: Webquests |publisher=Educational Broadcasting Corporation |year=2004 |accessdate=13 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Second, it emphasizes higher-order thinking (such as [[analysis]], [[creativity]], or [[criticism]]) rather than just acquiring information.&lt;ref name="eduworld"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.educationworld.com/a_issues/chat/chat015.shtml |title=Meet Bernie Dodge: The Frank Lloyd Wright Of Learning Environments |publisher=Education World|author=Linda Starr |date=2012-02-28 |accessdate=2012-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  And third, the teacher preselects the sources, emphasizing information use rather than information gathering.&lt;ref name=wqexplanation /&gt;  Finally, though solo WebQuests are not unknown, most WebQuests are [[group work]] with the task frequently being split into roles.&lt;ref name=wqexplanation /&gt;

==Structure==
A WebQuest has 6 essential parts: introduction, task, process, resources, evaluation, and conclusion.&lt;ref name=wqparts&gt;{{cite web |title=What are the essential parts of a WebQuest? |url=http://www.thirteen.org/edonline/concept2class/webquests/index_sub3.html |work=Concept to Classroom Workshop: Webquests|publisher=Educational Broadcasting Corporation |year=2004 |accessdate=13 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The original paper on WebQuests&lt;ref name=thoughtsaboutwq&gt;{{cite web |last=Dodge |first=Bernie |title=Some Thoughts About WebQuests |url=http://webquest.sdsu.edu/about_webquests.html|publisher=Distance-Educator.com |year=1995 |accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; had a component called guidance instead of evaluation.

===Task===
The task is the formal description of what the students will produce in the WebQuest.  The task should be meaningful and fun. Creating the task is the most difficult and creative part of developing a WebQuest.&lt;ref name=wqparts /&gt;

===Process===
The steps the students should take to accomplish the task.  It is frequently profitable to reinforce the written process with some demonstrations.&lt;ref name=wqparts /&gt;

===Resources===
The resources the students should use.  Providing these helps focus the exercise on [[Information processing|processing information]] rather than just locating it.  Though the instructor may search for the online resources as a separate step, it is good to incorporate them as links within the process section where they will be needed rather than just including them as a long list elsewhere.  Having off-line resources like visiting lecturers and sculptures can contribute greatly to the interest of the students.&lt;ref name=wqparts /&gt;

===Evaluation===
The way in which the students' performance will be [[Course evaluation|evaluated]].  The standards should be fair, clear, consistent, and specific to the tasks set.&lt;ref name=wqparts /&gt;

===Conclusion===
Time set aside for reflection and discussion of possible extensions.&lt;ref name=wqparts /&gt;

==Use in education==
Webquests can be a valuable addition to a collaborative classroom. One of the goals is to increase critical thinking by employing higher levels of [[Bloom's taxonomy|Bloom’s Taxonomy]] and Webb’s Depth of Knowledge. This is a goal of the American educational system's Common Core and many new American state standards for public education. Since most webquests are done in small collaborative groups, they can foster cooperative learning and collaborative activities. Students will often be assigned roles, allowing them to roleplay in different positions, and learn how to deal with conflict within the group.

Webquests can be a versatile tool for teaching students. They can be used to introduce new knowledge, to deepen knowledge, or to allow students to test hypotheses as part of a final interaction with knowledge. The integration of computers and the Internet also increase students’ competency with technology. By having specific task lists, students can stay on task. By having specific sources of information, students can focus on using resources to answer questions rather than vetting resources to use which is a different skill altogether. 

In inclusive classrooms (classrooms that have students of varying exceptionalities interacting such as learning disabled, language impaired, or giftedness) tasks can be differentiated to a skill level or collaborative groups for the same level of task. A skill level may have students with learning disabilities working on a basic task to meet the minimum standard of learning skills and gifted students pushing their task to the higher end of the learning skill. More commonly, groups are composed of learners of all skill levels and completing the same level of task. This is typically easier because the teacher is only creating one webquest, but can cause less student interaction from lower students and less learning from higher students.

===Limitations of WebQuests===
WebQuests are only one tool in a teacher's toolboxes.  They are not appropriate to every learning goal.  In particular, they are weak in teaching factual total recall, simple procedures, and definitions.&lt;ref name=critperspec /&gt;

WebQuests also usually require good reading skills, so are not appropriate to the youngest classrooms or to students with language and reading difficulties without accommodations. One might ask an adult to assist with the reading or use screen-reading technologies, such as VoiceOver or Jaws.&lt;ref name=critperspec&gt;{{cite web |title=What are some critical perspectives? |url=http://www.thirteen.org/edonline/concept2class/webquests/index_sub6.html |work=Concept to Classroom Workshop: WebQuests|publisher=Educational Broadcasting Corporation |year=2004 |accessdate=13 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==How WebQuests are developed==
Learners typically complete WebQuests as cooperative groups.  Each learner within a group can be given a "role," or specific area to research.  WebQuests may take the form of [[role-playing]] scenarios, where students take on the personas of professional researchers or historical figures.

A teacher can search for WebQuests on a particular topic or they can develop their own using a [[HTML editor|web editor]] like [[Microsoft FrontPage]] or [[Adobe Dreamweaver]].  This tool allows learners to complete various tasks using other cognitive toolsboxes (e.g. [[Microsoft Word]], [[Microsoft PowerPoint|PowerPoint]], [[Microsoft Access|Access]], [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]], and [[Microsoft Publisher|Publisher]]).  With the focus of education increasingly being turned to differentiated instruction, teachers are using WebQuests more frequently.  WebQuests also help to address the different learning styles of each students.  The number of activities associated with a WebQuest can reach almost any student.

WebQuests may be created by anyone; typically they are developed by educators.  The first part of a WebQuest is the introduction.  This describes the WebQuest and gives the purpose of the activity.  The next part describes what students will do.  Then is a list of what to do and how to do it.  There is usually a list of links to follow to complete the activity.

Finally, WebQuests do not have to be developed as a true web site.  They may be developed and implemented using lower threshold (less demanding) technologies, (e.g. they may be saved as a word document on a local computer).

Many Webquests are being developed by college students across the [[United States]] as a requirement for their [[K–12 (education)|k-12]] planning [[Electronic portfolio|e-portfolio]].

==Developments in WebQuest methodologies==
The WebQuest methodology has been transferred to [[Language acquisition|language learning]] in the [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[virtual world]] [[Second Life]] to create a more immersive and interactive experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Howard |last=Vickers |title=SurReal Quests: Enriched, purposeful language learning in Second Life |url=http://kt.flexiblelearning.net.au/tkt2007/edition-15/surreal-quests-enriched-purposeful-language-learning-in-second-life |work=The Knowledge Tree |date=2007-10-15 |accessdate=2007-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tools===
WebQuests are simple webpages, and they can be built with any software that allows you to create websites. Tech-savvy users can develop HTML in [[Microsoft Notepad|Notepad]] or Notepad++, while others will want to use the templates available in word processing suites like Microsoft Word and [[OpenOffice.org|OpenOffice]]. More advanced web development software, like Dreamweaver and FrontPage, will give you the most control over the design of your webquest. Webquest [[Web template|templates]] allow educators to get a jump start on the development of WebQuest by providing a pre-designed format which generally can be easily edited. These templates are categorized as "Framed" or "Unframed," and they can have a [[navigation bar]] at the top, bottom, left, or right of the content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webquest.sdsu.edu/LessonTemplate.html |title=webquest.sdsu.edu |publisher=webquest.sdsu.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.educationaltechnology.ca/resources/webquest/templates.php |title=www.educationaltechnology.ca |publisher=www.educationaltechnology.ca |date=2004-07-23 |accessdate=2012-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several websites that are specifically geared towards creating webquests. Questgarden, Zunal, and Teacherweb all allow teachers to create accounts, and these websites walk them through the process of creating a webquest. OpenWebQuest is a similar service, although it is based in Greece and much of the website is in Greek. These websites offer little control over design, but they make the creation process very simple and straightforward.

Alternatively, teachers can use one of a number of free website services to create their own website and structure it as a webquest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://listofwebquests.com/about-webquests/where-can-i-make-webquests/|title=www.listofwebquests.com|accessdate=2013-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wordpress and Edublogs both allow users to create free blogs, and navigation menus can be created to string a series of pages into a webquest. This option offers a greater deal of flexibility than pre-made webquests, but it requires a little more technical know-how.
