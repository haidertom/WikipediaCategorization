'''Analog observation''' is typically divided into two iteration of application: The first iteration primarily studies the effect of manipulation of variables in the subject's environment, including setting and events, on the subject's behavior. The second iteration primarily seeks to observe the subject's behavior in [[quasi-experiment]]al social situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Corsini|first=Raymond J.|title=Encyclopedia of psychology|year=1984|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|pages=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anywhere on Earth''' (AoE) is a calendar designation which indicates that a period expires when the date passes everywhere on Earth. The last place on Earth where any date exists is on [[Howland and Baker islands]], in the [[UTC−12:00|IDLW]] time zone (the West side of the [[International Date Line]]), and so is the last spot on the globe for any day to exist. Therefore, the day ends AoE when it ends on Howland Island.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ieee802.org/16/aoe.html|title=IEEE 802.16 AOE Deadline Documentation|website=www.ieee802.org|access-date=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The convention originated in [[IEEE 802.16]] balloting procedures. At this point, many IEEE 802 ballot deadlines are established as the end of day using "AoE", for "Anywhere on Earth" as a designation. This means that the deadline has not passed if, anywhere on Earth, the deadline date has not yet passed.

Note that the day's end AoE occurs at noon [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC) of the following day,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Howland and Baker islands]] being halfway around the world from the [[prime meridian]] that is the base reference longitude for UTC.

Thus, in standard notation this is:
: [[UTC−12:00]] hour&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/aoe|title=AoE – Anywhere on Earth (Time Zone Abbreviation)|website=www.timeanddate.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;My [[aspen]]s dear, whose airy cages quelled,

            That dandled a sandalled
            Shadow that swam or sank
On meadow and river and wind-wandering weed-winding bank.

O if we but knew what we do
            When we delve or hew— 
    Hack and rack the growing green!
            Since country is so tender
    To touch, her being so slender,
    That, like this sleek and seeing ball
    But a prick will make no eye at all,
            Where we, even where we mean
            To mend her we end her,
            When we hew or delve:
After-comers cannot guess the beauty been.
    Ten or twelve, only ten or twelve
            Strokes of havoc unselve
            The sweet especial scene,

[[File:Comparison Bioresilience with Biodiversity.jpg|thumb|Comparing the Features of Bioresilience and Biodiversity as Found on a Mountain Slope]]
'''Bioresilience''' refers to the ability of a whole [[species]] or an [[individual]] of a species to adapt to change. Initially the term applied to changes in the [[natural environment]], but increasingly it is also used for adaptation to anthropogenically induced change.&lt;ref name=r0&gt;{{Cite journal|date = 2014 | title = Vanishing fauna (Special issue)|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume=345|issue=6195| pages = 392–412 |url =http://www.sciencemag.org/site/special/vanishing/index.xhtml?_ga=1.172413478.429831163.1471029002 |doi= 10.1126/science.345.6195.392| bibcode=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Alexander von Humboldt]] was the first to note the resilience of [[life forms]] with increasing [[altitude]] and the accompanying decreasing prevalence in numbers, and he documented this in the 18th century on the slopes of the volcano [[Chimborazo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Andrea |last=Wulf |title=The Invention of Nature |location=New York |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |title=Alexander von Humboldt and the General Physics of the Earth |first=Stephen T. |last=Jackson |volume=324 |pages=596–597 |url=http://faculty.jsd.claremont.edu/dmcfarlane/bio176mcfarlane/pdf%20papers/Humboldt%20hsitory.pdf |doi=10.1126/science.1171659}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Understanding of bioresilience evolved from research led by [[The Mountain Institute]] when establishing two of the national parks that surround [[Mount Everest]], [[Makalu-Barun National Park]] in [[Nepal]], and [[Qomolangma National Nature Preserve]] in the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] of [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=T.B |last=Shrestha |title=Development Ecology of the Arun River Basin in Nepal |location=Kathmandu |publisher=International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development |year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research documented greater [[biodiversity]] at Everest’s base than higher up. There were progressively fewer documented species as the mountain ascended into higher [[biomes]], from [[subtropical]] to [[temperate]] to [[Alpine climate|alpine]] to Arctic-like. These fewer species, though, had greater biologic [[robustness]] correlating directly with increasing bioresilience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Daniel |last=Taylor-Ide |title=Something Hidden Behind the Ranges: A Himalayan Quest |location=San Francisco |publisher=Mercury House |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Current research==
Monitoring of bioresilience, beginning in the [[Everest]] ecosystem but expanding to other mountain ecologies globally is being carried out by the Biomeridian Project at [[Future Generations University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding Impacts on Life from Climate Change|url=https://www.future.edu/biomeridian/|website=Future Generations University|accessdate=October 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of bioresilience has also been applied to human health to explain aging or chronic diseases decrease the ability of the body to adapt; in such cases, the system becomes rigid and unable to cross different life demands. As the human body loses robustness with age, an individual becomes unable to accommodate new life demands, be they contagions, stress, or events such as injury or even jet lag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last= Yun |first=Joon | title=The Key To Health In Old Age: Bioresilience | website=[[Forbes]] | date=June 18, 2018 |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/nextavenue/2018/06/18/the-key-to-health-in-old-age-bioresillience/|accessdate=October 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance of resilience in biological systems has been widely recognized in terms of the impacts on life by anthropogenic changes.&lt;ref name=r0/&gt; Accelerating environmental change and continuing loss of genetic resources positions lower biodiversity around the planet threatening ecosystem services. A major mitigating factor will be life forms with higher resilience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Oliver |first=Tom H. |last2= Heard |first2=Mathew S. |first3= Nick J.B. |last3=Isaac |last4= Roy |first4=David B. |first5=Deborah |last5=Procter |first6=Felix |last6=Eigenbrod |first7=Rob |last7=Freckleton |first8=Andy |last8=Hector |first9=C.

Paralleling the work in mountain environments, a growing number of studies is applying the concept of bioresilience to assess the robustness of life in other ecological systems challenged by the Anthropocene. One such study was with the adaptive renewal and natural perturbation in Lake Victoria, the world’s second largest freshwater lake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Awiti |first=Alex O. |title=Biological Diversity and Resilience: Lessons from the Recovery of Cichlid Species in Lake Victoria |journal=[[Ecology &amp; Society]] |date=2011 |volume=16 |issue=1 |url=https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol16/iss1/art9/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Casimir pressure''' is created by the [[Casimir force]] of [[virtual particle]]s.

According to experiments, the Casimir force &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; between two closely spaced neutral parallel plate conductors is directly proportional to their surface area &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;F=PA.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, dividing the magnitude of Casimir force by the area of each conductor, Casimir pressure &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; can be found. Because the Casimir force between conductors is attractive, the Casimir pressure in space between the conductors is negative.

Because virtual particles are physical representations of the [[zero point energy]] of physical [[vacuum]], the Casimir pressure is the difference in the density of the zero point energy of empty space inside and outside of cavity made by conductive plates.

Some scientists{{who|date=November 2011}} believe that zero point energy is the dominant energy of the [[Universe]] and that the Casimir pressure of this energy is the main cause of the observed [[accelerated expansion]] of the Universe. In other words, virtual particles drive the accelerated expansion of the Universe.{{cn|date=November 2011}}

{{Marxism|Schools of thought}}
'''Classical Marxism''' refers to the economic, philosophical and sociological theories expounded by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] as contrasted with later developments in [[Marxism]], especially [[Leninism]] and [[Marxism–Leninism]].

==Karl Marx==
[[File:Marx4.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Karl Marx]] in 1861]]
{{details|Karl Marx}}
Karl Heinrich Marx (May 5, 1818, [[Trier]], [[German Confederation|Germany]] &amp;ndash; March 14, 1883, [[London]]) was an immensely influential German [[philosopher]], [[sociologist]], [[political economist]] and [[revolutionary socialist]]. Marx addressed a wide range of issues, including [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]] and exploitation of the worker, the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] and historical materialism, although he is most famous for his analysis of history in terms of class struggles, summed up in the opening line of the introduction to ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'': "The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles". The influence of his ideas, already popular during his life, was given added impetus by the victory of the [[Russia]]n [[Bolsheviks]] in the 1917 [[October Revolution]] and there are few parts of the world which were not significantly touched by Marxian ideas in the course of the twentieth century.

As the American Marx scholar [[Hal Draper]] remarked: "[T]here are few thinkers in modern history whose thought has been so badly misrepresented, by Marxists and anti-Marxists alike".

===Early influences===
{{main|The Three Sources and Three Component Parts of Marxism}}
{{details|Influences on Karl Marx}}
The early influences on Marx are often grouped into three categories: German philosophy, English/Scottish political economy and French socialism.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1913/mar/x01.htm The Three Sources and Three Component Parts of Marxism]''&amp;nbsp;by [[Vladimir I. Lenin]] at the [[Marxists Internet Archive]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====German philosophy====
Main influences include [[Immanuel Kant]]; [[G. W. F. Hegel]]; and [[Ludwig Feuerbach]]. 

Marx studied under one of Hegel's pupils, [[Bruno Bauer]], a leader of the circle of [[Young Hegelians]] to whom Marx attached himself. However, from 1841 he and Engels came to disagree with Bauer and the rest of the Young Hegelians about socialism and also about the usage of Hegel's dialectic and progressively broke away from [[German idealism]] and the Young Hegelians. Marx's early writings are thus a response towards Hegel, German idealism and a break with the rest of the Young Hegelians. Marx, "stood Hegel on his head", in his own view of his role by turning the idealistic dialectic into a materialistic one, in proposing that material circumstances shape ideas instead of the other way around. In this, Marx was following the lead of Feuerbach. His [[Marx's theory of alienation|theory of alienation]], developed in the ''[[Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844|Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844]]'' (published in 1932), inspired itself from Feuerbach's critique of the alienation of Man in God through the [[objectivation]] of all his inherent characteristics (thus man projected on God all qualities which are in fact man's own quality which defines the "[[human nature]]"). But Marx also criticized Feuerbach for being insufficiently materialistic.

====English and Scottish political economy====
Main influences include [[Adam Smith]] and [[David Ricardo]]. 

Marx built on and critiqued the most well-known political economists of his day, the British classical political economists.

Marx critiqued Smith and Ricardo for not realizing that their economic concepts reflected specifically capitalist institutions, not innate natural properties of human society and could not be applied unchanged to all societies. He proposed a systematic correlation between labour-values and money prices. He claimed that the source of profits under capitalism is value added by workers not paid out in wages. This mechanism operated through the distinction between "labour power", which workers freely exchanged for their wages; and "labour", over which asset-holding capitalists thereby gained control. This practical and theoretical distinction was Marx's primary insight, and allowed him to develop the concept of "surplus value", which distinguished his works from that of Smith and Ricardo.

====French socialism====
Main influences include [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]; [[Charles Fourier]]; [[Henri de Saint-Simon]]; [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]; and [[Louis Blanc]].

Rousseau was one of the first modern writers to seriously attack the institution of [[private property]] and therefore is sometimes considered a forebear of modern [[socialism]] and [[communism]], though Marx rarely mentions Rousseau in his writings.

In 1833, France was experiencing a number of social problems arising out of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. A number of sweeping plans of reform were developed by thinkers on the [[Left-wing politics|political left]]. Among the more grandiose were the plans of [[Charles Fourier]] and the followers of [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]]. Fourier wanted to replace modern cities with utopian communities while the Saint-Simonians advocated directing the economy by manipulating credit. Although these programs did not have much support, they did expand the political and social imagination of Marx.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MSN Encarta – France |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761568934_23/France.html#p464 |website= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwR60qYA?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761568934_23/France.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Louis Blanc]] is perhaps best known for originating the social principle, later adopted by Marx, of how labor and income should be distributed: “From each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MSN Encarta – Communism |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761572241/Communism.html#p9 |website= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwR6a1r6?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761572241/Communism.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] participated in the February 1848 uprising and the composition of what he termed "the first republican proclamation" of the new republic, but he had misgivings about the new government because it was pursuing political reform at the expense of the socio-economic reform, which Proudhon considered basic. Proudhon published his own perspective for reform, ''Solution du problème social'', in which he laid out a program of mutual financial cooperation among workers. He believed this would transfer control of economic relations from capitalists and financiers to workers. It was Proudhon's book ''[[What Is Property?]]'' that convinced the young Karl Marx that [[private property]] should be abolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Proudhon|first=Pierre-Joseph|title=What is property?|year=2007|publisher=Cosimo Inc.|location=New York, NY|isbn=9781602060944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other influences on Marx====
Main influences includes [[Friedrich Engels]]; [[Ancient Greek philosophy|ancient Greek]] [[materialism]]; [[Giambattista Vico]]; and [[Lewis H. Morgan]].

Marx's revision of [[Hegelianism]] was also influenced by Engels' book  ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England]]'' in 1844, which led Marx to conceive of the historical dialectic in terms of class conflict and to see the modern working class as the most progressive force for revolution.

Marx was influenced by Antique materialism, especially [[Epicurus]] (to whom Marx dedicated his thesis,  ''[[The Difference Between the Democritean and Epicurean Philosophy of Nature]]'', 1841) for his materialism and theory of [[clinamen]] which opened up a realm of liberty.

[[Giambattista Vico]] propounded a [[cyclical theory]] of history, according to which human societies progress through a series of stages from barbarism to civilization and then return to barbarism. In the first stage—called the Age of the Gods—religion, the family and other basic institutions emerge; in the succeeding Age of Heroes, the common people are kept in subjection by a dominant class of nobles; in the final stage—the Age of Men—the people rebel and win equality, but in the process society begins to disintegrate. Vico's influence on Marx is obvious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MSN Encarta - Giambattista Vico |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761551498/Giambattista_Vico.html |website= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwR5SlMg?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761551498/Giambattista_Vico.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx drew on [[Lewis H. Morgan]] and his [[social evolution]] theory. He wrote a collection of notebooks from his reading of Lewis Morgan, but they are regarded as being quite obscure and only available in scholarly editions. (However Engels is much more noticeably influenced by Morgan than Marx).

==Friedrich Engels==
{{details|Friedrich Engels}}
[[File:Engels.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Friedrich Engels]] was a co-founder and proponent of [[Marxism]]]]
Friedrich Engels (November 28, 1820, [[Wuppertal]] – August 5, 1895, [[London]]) was a nineteenth-century German [[Political philosophy|political philosopher]]. He developed [[Communism|communist]] theory alongside his better-known collaborator, [[Karl Marx]].

In 1842, his father sent the young Engels to England to help manage his cotton factory in Manchester. Shocked by the widespread [[poverty]], Engels began writing an account which he published in 1845 as ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'' ([http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/condition-working-class/index.htm]).

In July 1845, Engels went to England, where he met an Irish working-class woman named [[Mary Burns]] ([http://www.bbc.co.uk/legacies/work/england/manchester/article_4.shtml Crosby]), with whom he lived until her death in 1863 (Carver 2003:19). Later, Engels lived with her sister Lizzie, marrying her the day before she died in 1877 (Carver 2003:42). These women may have introduced him to the [[Chartism|Chartist]] movement, of whose leaders he met several, including [[George Julian Harney|George Harney]].

Engels actively participated in the [[Revolution of 1848]], taking part in the uprising at [[Elberfeld]]. Engels fought in the [[Baden campaign]] against the [[Prussia]]ns (June/July 1849) as the [[aide-de-camp]] of [[August Willich]], who commanded a Free Corps in the Baden-Palatinate uprising. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1850/german-imperial/ch01.htm]

===Marx and Engels===
Marx and Engels first met in person in September 1844. They discovered that they had similar views on [[philosophy]] and on [[capitalism]] and decided to work together, producing a number of works including ''Die heilige Familie'' (''[[The Holy Family (book)|The Holy Family]]''). After the French authorities deported Marx from France in January 1845, Engels and Marx decided to move to Belgium, which then permitted greater [[freedom of expression]] than some other countries in Europe. Engels and Marx returned to Brussels in January 1846, where they set up the Communist Correspondence Committee.

In 1847, Engels and Marx began writing a pamphlet together, based on Engels' ''The Principles of Communism''. They completed the 12,000-word pamphlet in six weeks, writing it in such a manner as to make communism understandable to a wide audience and published it as ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' in February 1848. In March, Belgium expelled both Engels and Marx. They moved to Cologne, where they began to publish a radical newspaper, the ''[[Neue Rheinische Zeitung]]''. By 1849, both Engels and Marx had to leave Germany and moved to London. The Prussian authorities applied pressure on the British government to expel the two men, but [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]] refused. With only the money that Engels could raise, the Marx family lived in extreme poverty. The contributions of Marx and Engels to the formation of Marxist theory have been described as inseparable.&lt;ref&gt;For example see [[Franz Mehring]]: “The more their thought and their development became one, the more they each remained a separate entity and a man”, in Mehring: ''Karl Marx: The Story of His Life'' (1918), Chapter 8 Marx and Engels [http://www.marxists.org/archive/mehring/1918/marx/ch08.htm#s2 2. An Incomparable Alliance]
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main ideas==
Marx's main ideas included:
* [[Marx's theory of alienation|Alienation]]: Marx refers to the alienation of people from aspects of their "human nature" ("''Gattungswesen''", usually translated as "species-essence" or "species-being"). He believed that alienation is a systematic result of capitalism. Under capitalism, the fruits of production belong to the employers, who expropriate the surplus created by others and in so doing generate alienated labour.&lt;ref&gt;''A Dictionary of Sociology'', Article: Alienation&lt;/ref&gt; Alienation describes objective features of a person's situation in capitalism—it is not necessary for them to believe or feel that they are alienated.
* [[Base and superstructure (Marxism)|Base and superstructure]]: Marx and Engels use the “base-structure” concept to explain the idea that the totality of relations among people with regard to “the social production of their existence” forms the economic basis, on which arises a superstructure of political and legal institutions. To the base corresponds the social consciousness which includes religious, philosophical and other main ideas. The base conditions both, the superstructure and the social consciousness. A conflict between the development of material productive forces and the relations of production causes social revolutions and the resulting change in the economic basis will sooner or later lead to the transformation of the superstructure.&lt;ref&gt;See Marx: ''[[A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy]]'' (1859), [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1859/critique-pol-economy/preface.htm Preface], Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1977, with some notes by R. Rojas,
and Engels: ''[[Anti-Dühring]]'' (1877), Introduction [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1877/anti-duhring/introduction.htm General]
&lt;/ref&gt; For Marx, this relationship is not a one way process—it is reflexive and the base determines the superstructure in the first instance at the same time as it remains the foundation of a form of social organization which is itself transformed as an element in the overall dialectical process. The relationship between superstructure and base is considered to be a [[dialectics|dialectical]] one, [[ineffability|ineffable]] in a sense except as it unfolds in its material reality in the actual historical process (which [[scientific socialism]] aims to explain and ultimately to guide).
* [[Class consciousness]]: class consciousness refers to the awareness, both of itself and of the social world around it, that a [[social class]] possesses and its capacity to act in its own rational interests based on this awareness. Thus class consciousness must be attained before the class may mount a successful revolution. However, other methods of revolutionary action have been developed, such as [[vanguardism]].
* [[Exploitation of labour#Marxist theory|Exploitation]]: Marx refers to the exploitation of an entire segment or class of society by another. He sees it as being an inherent feature and key element of capitalism and free markets. The profit gained by the capitalist is the difference between the value of the product made by the worker and the actual wage that the worker receives—in other words, capitalism functions on the basis of paying workers less than the full value of their labor in order to enable the capitalist class to turn a profit.
* [[Historical materialism]]: historical materialism was first articulated by Marx, although he himself never used the term. It looks for the causes of developments and changes in human societies in the way in which humans collectively make the means to life, thus giving an emphasis through economic analysis to everything that co-exists with the economic base of society (e.g. social classes, political structures, ideologies).
* [[Means of production]]: the means of production are a combination of the [[means of labor]] and the [[subject of labor]] used by workers to make products. The means of labor include machines, tools, equipment, infrastructure and "all those things with the aid of which man acts upon the subject of labor, and transforms it".&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Economics of the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R. (1957). xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; The subject of labor includes raw materials and materials directly taken from nature. Means of production by themselves produce nothing— [[labour (economics)|labor power]] is needed for production to take place.
* [[Ideology#Ideology as an instrument of social reproduction|Ideology]]: without offering a general definition for "ideology",&lt;ref&gt;Joseph McCarney:
''[http://marxmyths.org/joseph-mccarney/article.htm Ideology and False Consciousness]'', April 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Marx on several instances has used the term to designate the production of images of social reality. According to Engels, “ideology is a process accomplished by the so-called thinker consciously, it is true, but with a false consciousness. The real motive forces impelling him remain unknown to him; otherwise it simply would not be an ideological process. Hence he imagines false or seeming motive forces”.&lt;ref&gt;Engels: [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1893/letters/93_07_14.htm Letter] to [[Franz Mehring]], (London July 14, 1893), transl. by Donna Torr, in ''Marx and Engels Correspondence'', International Publishers 1968&lt;/ref&gt; Because the ruling class controls the society's means of production, the superstructure of society as well as its ruling ideas will be determined according to what is in the ruling class's best interests. As Marx said famously in ''The German Ideology'', “the ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas, i.e. the class which is the ruling material force of society, is at the same time its ruling intellectual force”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01b.htm  Karl Marx, ''The German Ideology'']&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore the ideology of a society is of enormous importance since it confuses the alienated groups and can create [[false consciousness]] such as commodity fetishism (perceiving labor as capital—a degradation of human life).
* [[Mode of production]]: the mode of production is a specific combination of [[productive forces]] (including human the [[means of production]] and [[labour power]], tools, equipment, buildings and technologies, materials and improved land) and social and technical [[relations of production]] (including the property, power and control relations governing society's productive assets, often codified in law, cooperative work relations and forms of association, relations between people and the objects of their work and the relations between social classes).
* [[Political economy]]: the term "political economy" originally meant the study of the conditions under which production was organized in the nation-states of the new-born capitalist system. Political economy then studies the mechanism of human activity in organizing material and the mechanism of distributing the surplus or deficit that is the result of that activity. Political economy studies the means of production, specifically capital and how this manifests itself in economic activity.

===Marx's concept of class===
{{Ref improve section|date=May 2012}}
Marx believed that class identity was configured in the relations with the mode of production. In other words, a class is a collective of individuals who have a similar relationship with the means of production (as opposed to the more common-sense idea that class is determined by wealth alone, i.e. high class, middle class and poor class).

Marx describes several [[social class]]es in capitalist societies, including primarily:
* The [[proletariat]]: "those individuals who sell their [[labor power]], (and therefore add value to the products), and who, in the capitalist mode of production, do not own the means of production". According to Marx, the capitalist mode of production establishes the conditions for the [[bourgeoisie]] to [[Exploitation of labour#Marxian theory|exploit]] the proletariat due to the fact that the worker's [[labor power]] generates an [[Surplus value|added value]] greater than his [[salary]].
* The [[bourgeoisie]]: those who "own the means of production" and buy [[labor power]] from the proletariat, who are recompensed by a salary, thus [[Exploitation of labour#Marxian theory|exploit]]ing the proletariat.
The bourgeoisie may be further subdivided into the very wealthy bourgeoisie and the [[petty bourgeoisie]]. The petty bourgeoisie are those who employ labor, but may also work themselves. These may be small proprietors, land-holding peasants, or trade workers. Marx predicted that the petty bourgeoisie would eventually be destroyed by the constant reinvention of the means of production and the result of this would be the forced movement of the vast majority of the petty bourgeoisie to the proletariat. Marx also identified the [[lumpenproletariat]], a stratum of society completely disconnected from the means of production.

Marx also describes the [[communists]] as separate from the oppressed proletariat. The communists were to be a unifying party among the proletariat; they were educated revolutionaries who could bring the proletariat to revolution and help them establish the democratic [[dictatorship of the proletariat]].&lt;ref&gt;[[The Communist Manifesto]] 80-87&lt;/ref&gt; According to Marx, the communists would support any true revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie. Thus the communists aide the proletariat in creating the inevitable classless society ([[Vladimir Lenin]] takes this concept a step further by stating that only "professional revolutionaries" can lead the revolution against the bourgeoisie).

===Marx's theory of history===
{{main|Marx's theory of history}}
The Marxist theory of historical materialism understands society as fundamentally determined by the material conditions at any given time—this means the relationships which people enter into with one another in order to fulfill their basic needs, for instance to feed and clothe themselves and their families.&lt;ref&gt;See in particular [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ Marx and Engels, ''The German Ideology'']&lt;/ref&gt; In general, Marx and Engels identified five successive stages of the development of these material conditions in Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Marx makes no claim to have produced a master key to history. Historical materialism is not "an historico-philosophic theory of the marche generale imposed by fate upon every people, whatever the historic circumstances in which it finds itself". (Marx, Karl, Letter to editor of the Russian paper Otetchestvennye Zapiskym, 1877) His ideas, he explains, are based on a concrete study of the actual conditions that pertained in Europe.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clay''' is a finely-grained natural [[Rock (geology)|rock]] or [[soil]] material that combines one or more [[clay minerals]] with possible traces of [[quartz]] (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[metal oxide]]s ([[Aluminium oxide|Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ,]] [[Magnesium oxide|MgO]] etc.) and [[organic matter]]. Geologic clay [[deposit (geology)|deposits]] are mostly composed of [[Silicate minerals#Phyllosilicates|phyllosilicate minerals]] containing variable amounts of [[water]] trapped in the mineral structure. Clays are [[Plasticity (physics)|plastic]] due to particle size and geometry as well as water content, and become hard, brittle and non–plastic upon drying or [[Pottery#Firing|firing]].&lt;ref name="guggenheim"&gt;{{harvnb|Guggenheim|Martin|1995|pp=255–256}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="University College London Geology on Campus: Clays"&gt;{{cite web|title=University College London Geology on Campus: Clays |url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/earth-sciences/impact/geology/london/ucl/materials/clay |publisher=Earth Sciences department, [[University College London]]|accessdate=10 January 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160127051002/https://www.ucl.ac.uk/earth-sciences/impact/geology/london/ucl/materials/clay|archivedate=27 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Science Learning Hub"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is clay|url=http://sciencelearn.org.nz/Contexts/Ceramics/Science-Ideas-and-Concepts/What-is-clay|website=Science Learning Hub|publisher=[[University of Waikato]]|accessdate=10 January 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160103182308/http://sciencelearn.org.nz/Contexts/Ceramics/Science-Ideas-and-Concepts/What-is-clay|archivedate=3 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Soil classification|Depending on the soil's content]] in which it is found, clay can appear in various colours from white to dull grey or brown to deep orange-red.

Although many naturally occurring deposits include both silts and clay, clays are distinguished from other fine-grained soils by differences in size and mineralogy. [[Silt]]s, which are fine-grained soils that do not include clay minerals, tend to have larger particle sizes than clays. There is, however, some overlap in particle size and other physical properties.  The distinction between silt and clay varies by discipline. [[Geologist]]s and [[soil scientist]]s usually consider the separation to occur at a particle size of 2 [[Micrometre|µm]] (clays being finer than silts), [[sedimentologist]]s often use 4–5 μm, and [[colloid]] [[chemist]]s use 1 μm.&lt;ref name="guggenheim" /&gt; [[Geotechnical engineering|Geotechnical engineers]] distinguish between silts and clays based on the plasticity properties of the soil, as measured by the soils' [[Atterberg limits]]. [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 14688 grades clay particles as being smaller than 2 μm and silt particles as being larger.

Mixtures of [[sand]], [[silt]] and less than 40% clay are called [[loam]]. Loam makes good [[soil]] and is used as a building material.

== Formation ==
[[File:Hillside deforestation in Rio de Janeiro.jpg|thumb|Deforestation for clay extraction in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]]. The picture is of Morro da Covanca, Jacarepaguá.]]
Clay minerals typically form over long periods of time as a result of the gradual chemical [[weathering]] of rocks, usually silicate-bearing, by low concentrations of [[carbonic acid]] and other diluted [[solvents]]. These solvents, usually acidic, migrate through the weathering rock after [[Leaching (pedology)|leaching]] through upper weathered layers. In addition to the weathering process, some clay minerals are formed through [[hydrothermal]] activity. There are two types of clay deposits: primary and secondary. Primary clays form as residual deposits in soil and remain at the site of formation. Secondary clays are clays that have been transported from their original location by water erosion and [[Deposition (geology)|deposited]] in a new [[sedimentary]] deposit.&lt;ref name=USGS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/info/clays/|title=Environmental Characteristics of Clays and Clay Mineral Deposits|work=usgs.gov|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208055734/http://pubs.usgs.gov/info/clays/|archivedate=8 December 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clay deposits are typically associated with very low energy [[Sedimentary depositional environment|depositional environments]] such as large lakes and marine basins.

== Grouping ==
Depending on the academic source, there are three or four main groups of clays: [[kaolin]]ite, [[montmorillonite]]-[[smectite]], [[illite]], and [[chlorite group|chlorite]]. Chlorites are not always considered to be a clay, sometimes being classified as a separate group within the [[phyllosilicate]]s. There are approximately 30 different types of "pure" clays in these categories, but most "natural" clay deposits are mixtures of these different types, along with other weathered minerals.

[[Varve]] (or ''varved clay'') is clay with visible annual layers, which are formed by seasonal deposition of those layers and are marked by differences in [[erosion]] and organic content. This type of [[deposition (geology)|deposit]] is common in former [[glacial lake]]s. When fine sediments are delivered into the calm waters of these glacial lake basins away from the shoreline, they settle to the lake bed. The resulting seasonal layering is preserved in an even distribution of clay sediment banding.&lt;ref name=USGS /&gt;

[[Quick clay]] is a unique type of [[marine clay]] indigenous to the glaciated terrains of [[Norway]], [[Canada]], [[Northern Ireland]], and [[Sweden]]. It is a highly sensitive clay, prone to [[Soil liquefaction|liquefaction]], which has been involved in several deadly [[landslide]]s.

Clays exhibit [[plasticity (physics)|plasticity]] when mixed with water in certain proportions. However, when dry, clay becomes firm and when [[pottery firing|fired]] in a [[kiln]], permanent physical and chemical changes occur. These changes convert the clay into a [[ceramic]] material. Because of these properties, clay is used for making [[pottery]], both utilitarian and decorative, and construction products, such as bricks, wall and floor tiles. Different types of clay, when used with different [[mineral]]s and firing conditions, are used to produce [[earthenware]], [[stoneware]], and [[porcelain]]. [[Prehistoric]] humans discovered the useful properties of clay. Some of the earliest pottery shards recovered are from central [[Honshu]], [[Japan]].

Purpose-made clay balls were also used as [[sling (weapon)#Ammunition|sling ammunition]].

Clays [[sintering|sintered]] in fire were the first form of [[ceramic]]. [[Brick]]s, cooking pots, art objects, [[dishware]], [[smoking pipe (tobacco)|smoking pipes]], and even [[musical instrument]]s such as the [[ocarina]] can all be shaped from clay before being fired. Clay is also used in many industrial processes, such as [[paper]] making, [[cement]] production, and chemical [[filter (chemistry)|filtering]].

The '''length of the day''', which has increased over the long term of [[Earth's history]] due to [[tidal acceleration|tidal effects]], is also subject to fluctuations on a shorter scale of time. Exact measurements of time by [[atomic clock]]s and satellite [[laser ranging]] have revealed that the length of day (LOD) is subject to a number of different changes. These subtle variations have periods that range from a few weeks to a few years. They are attributed to interactions between the dynamic [[atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]] and Earth itself. The [[International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service]] monitors the changes.

==Introduction==
In the absence of external torques, the total [[angular momentum]] of Earth as a whole system must be constant. Internal torques are due to relative movements and mass redistribution of Earth's core, mantle, crust, oceans, atmosphere, and [[cryosphere]]. In order to keep the total [[angular momentum]] constant, a change of the angular momentum  in one region  must necessarily be balanced by angular momentum changes in the other regions.

Crustal movements (such as [[continental drift]]) or polar cap melting are slow secular events. The characteristic coupling time between core and mantle has been estimated to be on the order of ten years, and the so-called 'decade fluctuations' of [[Earth's rotation]] rate are thought to result from fluctuations within the core, transferred to the mantle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hide|first=R.|title=Fluctuations in the Earth's Rotation and the Topography of the Core–Mantle Interface|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|volume=328|issue=1599|pages=351–363|doi=10.1098/rsta.1989.0040|date=1989|bibcode = 1989RSPTA.328..351H }}&lt;/ref&gt; The length of day (LOD) varies significantly even for time scales from a few years down to weeks (Figure), and the observed fluctuations in the LOD - after eliminating the effects of external torques - are  a direct consequence of the action of internal torques. These short term fluctuations are very probably generated by the interaction between the solid Earth and the atmosphere.

==Observations==
[[Image:Deviation of day length from SI day.svg|thumb|Deviation of day length from SI based day]]
Any change of the axial component of the atmospheric [[angular momentum]] (AAM) must be accompanied by a corresponding change of the angular momentum of Earth's crust and mantle (due to the law of conservation of angular momentum). Because the [[moment of inertia]] of the system mantle-crust is only slightly influenced by atmospheric pressure loading, this mainly requires a change in the [[angular velocity]] of the solid Earth; ''i.e.'', a change of LOD. The LOD can presently be measured to a high accuracy over integration times of only a few hours,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robertson|first=Douglas|title=Geophysical applications of very-long-baseline interferometry|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|date=1991|volume=63|issue=4|pages=899–918|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.63.899|bibcode = 1991RvMP...63..899R }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[general circulation model]]s of the atmosphere allow high precision determination of changes in AAM in the model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eubanks|first=T.

In particular, one recognizes an annual period of LOD with an amplitude of 0.34&amp;nbsp;milliseconds, maximizing on February 3, and a semiannual period with an amplitude of 0.29&amp;nbsp;milliseconds, maximizing on May 8,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosen|first=Richard D.|title=The axial momentum balance of Earth and its fluid envelope|journal=Surveys in Geophysics|date=1993|volume=14|issue=1|pages=1–29|doi=10.1007/BF01044076|bibcode = 1993SGeo...14....1R }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as 10‑day fluctuations of the order of 0.1&amp;nbsp;milliseconds. Interseasonal fluctuations reflecting [[El Niño]] events and quasi-biennial oscillations have also been observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Carter, W.E. |author2=D.S.

O.|title=Earth's Variable Rotation|journal=Science|date=1991|volume=253|issue=5020|pages=629–637|doi=10.1126/science.253.5020.629|pmid=17772366|bibcode = 1991Sci...253..629H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exchange of angular momentum==

One means of exchange of angular momentum between the atmosphere and the non gaseous parts of the earth is evaporation and precipitation. Massive quantities of water are in continual flux between the oceans and the atmosphere. As the mass of water (vapour) rises its rotation must slow due to conservation of angular momentum. Equally when if falls as rain, its rate of rotation will increase to conserve angular momentum. Any net global transfer of water mass from oceans to the atmosphere or the opposite implies a change in the speed of rotation of the solid/liquid Earth which will be reflected in LOD. {{citation needed | date = March 2016}}

Observational evidence shows that there is no significant time delay between the change of AAM and its corresponding change of LOD for periods longer than about 10&amp;nbsp;days. This implies a strong coupling between atmosphere and solid Earth due to surface [[friction]] with a time constant of  about 7&amp;nbsp;days, the spin-down time of the [[Ekman layer]]. This spin-down time is the characteristic time for the transfer of atmospheric axial angular momentum to Earth's surface and vice versa.

The zonal wind-component on the ground, which is most effective for the transfer of axial angular momentum between Earth and atmosphere, is the component describing rigid rotation of the  atmosphere.&lt;ref name=Volland&gt;{{cite journal|last=Volland|first=H.|title=Atmosphere and Earth's rotation|journal=Surveys in Geophysics|date=1996|volume=17|issue=1|pages=101–144|doi=10.1007/BF01904476|bibcode = 1996SGeo...17..101V }}&lt;/ref&gt; The zonal wind of this component has the  amplitude ''u'' at the equator relative to the ground, where  ''u''&amp;nbsp;&gt; 0 indicates superrotation and ''u''&amp;nbsp;&lt; 0 indicates retrograde rotation with respect to the solid Earth. All other wind terms merely redistribute the AAM with latitude, an effect that cancels out when averaged over the globe.

Surface friction allows the atmosphere to 'pick up' angular momentum from Earth in the case of retrograde rotation or release it to Earth in the case of superrotation. Averaging over longer time scales, no exchange  of AAM with the solid Earth takes place. Earth and atmosphere are decoupled. This implies that the  ground level zonal wind-component responsible for rigid rotation must be zero on the average. Indeed, the observed meridional structure of the climatic mean zonal wind on the ground shows westerly winds (from the west) in middle latitudes beyond about ± 30&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; latitude and easterly winds (from the east) in low latitudes—the [[trade wind]]s—as well as near the poles
([[prevailing winds]]).&lt;ref name="Murgatroyd"&gt;Murgatroyd, R.J., .
The structure and dynamics of the stratosphere, in Coby G.A. (ed): ''The Global Circulation of the  Atmosphere'',  Roy. Met. Soc., London, p. 159, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;
The atmosphere picks up angular momentum from Earth at low and high latitudes and transfers the same amount to Earth at middle latitudes.

Any short term fluctuation of the rigidly rotating zonal wind-component is then accompanied by a corresponding  change in LOD. In order to estimate the order of magnitude of that effect, one may consider the total atmosphere to rotate  rigidly with velocity ''u'' (in m/s) without surface friction. Then this value is related to the corresponding change of the length of day Δ''{{tau}}'' (in milliseconds) as
 
:''u'' ≃ 2.7 Δ''{{tau}}'' {{citation needed | date = November 2017}}

The annual component of the change of the length of day of Δ''{{tau}}''&amp;nbsp;≃ 0.34&amp;nbsp;ms corresponds then to a superrotation of ''u''&amp;nbsp;≃ 0.9&amp;nbsp;m/s, and the semiannual component of Δ''{{tau}}''&amp;nbsp;≃ 0.29&amp;nbsp;ms to ''u''&amp;nbsp;≃ 0.8&amp;nbsp;m/s.

Although many models, both animal and human, have appeared to support this theory, parts of it are still controversial. 
Specifically, while the [[evolutionary trade-off]] between [[Mechanistic target of rapamycin#Aging|growth and aging]] has been well established, 
the relationship between reproduction and aging is still without [[scientific consensus]], and the cellular mechanisms largely undiscovered.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Blagosklonny, MV | year = 2010| title = Why the disposable soma theory cannot explain why women live longer and why we age | journal = Aging | volume = 2 | issue = 12 | pages = 884–887 | doi=10.18632/aging.100253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background and history ==

British biologist Thomas Kirkwood first proposed the disposable soma theory of aging in a 1977 [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']] review article.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; The theory was inspired by [[Leslie Orgel|Leslie Orgel's]] [[Error catastrophe|Error Catastrophe Theory of Aging]], which was published fourteen years earlier, in 1963. Orgel believed that the process of aging arose due to mutations acquired during the replication process, and Kirkwood developed the disposable soma theory in order to mediate Orgel's work with [[evolutionary genetics]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

==Principles==
The disposable soma theory of aging acts on the premise that there is a tradeoff in [[resource allocation]] between [[Maintenance of an organism|somatic maintenance]] and [[Parental investment|reproductive investment]]. Too low an investment in self-repair would be evolutionarily unsound, as the organism would likely die before reproductive age. However, too high an investment in self-repair would also be [[Fitness (biology)|evolutionarily unsound]] due to the fact that one's [[Survivorship curve|offspring would likely die before reproductive age]]. Therefore, there is a compromise and resources are partitioned accordingly. However, this compromise is thought to damage somatic repair systems, which can lead to [[DNA damage theory of aging|progressive cellular damage and senescence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Drenos F, Kirkwood, TB | year = 2005| title = Modelling the disposable soma theory of ageing | journal = Mech Ageing Dev. | volume = 126 | issue = 1 | pages = 99–103| doi=10.1016/j.mad.2004.09.026}}&lt;/ref&gt; Repair costs can be categorized into three groups: (1) the costs of increased [[Regeneration (biology)#Tissues|durability of nonrenewable parts]]; (2) the costs of maintenance involving [[Autophagy|cell renewal]], and (3) the costs of intracellular maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Kirkwood, TB, Rose MR | year = 1991| title = Evolution of senescence: late survival sacrificed for reproduction.| journal = Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci | volume = 332 | issue = 1262 | pages = 15–24| doi=10.1098/rstb.1991.0028}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a nutshell, [[Antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis|aging and decline is essentially a tradeoff]] for increased reproductive robustness in youth.

=== Growth and somatic maintenance === 
{{main|Mechanistic target of rapamycin#Aging}}
Much research has been done on the antagonistic effects of increased growth on lifespan. Specifically, the hormone [[insulin-like growth factor 1]] (IGF-1), binds to a cell receptor, leading to a [[phosphorylation cascade]]. This cascade results in kinases phosphorylating [[FOX proteins|forkhead transcription factor]] (FOXO), deactivating it. Deactivation of FOXO results in an inability to express genes involved in responding to [[oxidative stress |oxidative stress response]], such as [[antioxidants]], [[Chaperone (protein)|chaperones]], and [[heat-shock proteins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=O'Neill BT, Lee KY, Klaus K, Softic S; et al. | year = 2016 | title = Insulin and IGF-1 receptors regulate FoxO-mediated signaling in muscle proteostasis | journal = J Clin Invest | volume = 126 | issue = 9 | pages = 3433-3346 | doi=10.1172/JCI86522| pmc = 5004956 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Additionally, uptake of IGF-1 stimulates the [[Mechanistic target of rapamycin|mTOR]] pathway, which activates protein synthesis (and therefore growth) through upregulation of the translation-promoting [[P70-S6 Kinase 1|S6K1]], and also inhibits [[autophagy]], a process necessary for recycling of damaged cellular products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Johnson SC, Rabinovitch PS, Kaeberlein M| year = 2013 | title = mTOR is a key modulator of ageing and age-related disease| journal = Nature | volume = 493 | issue = | pages = 338–345 | doi=10.1038/nature11861| bibcode = 2013Natur.493..338J| pmc = 3687363}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Decline of autophagy causes [[neurodegeneration]], [[protein aggregation]] and [[premature aging]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Komatsu M, Waguri S, Chiba T, Murata S; et al. | year = 2006 | title = Loss of autophagy in the central nervous system causes neurodegeneration in mice | journal = Nature | volume = 441 | issue = | pages = 880–884 | doi=10.1038/nature04723| bibcode = 2006Natur.441..880K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, studies have also indicated that the mTOR pathway also alters [[immune responses]] and  stimulates [[cyclin-dependent kinase]] (CDK) inhibitors such as [[p16]] and [[p21]]. This leads to alteration of the [[stem-cell niche]] and results in [[Stem cell theory of aging|stem cell exhaustion]], another theorized mechanism of aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Castilho RM1, Squarize CH, Chodosh LA, Williams BO; et al. | year = 2009| title = mTOR mediates Wnt-induced epidermal stem cell exhaustion and aging.| journal = Cell Stem Cell | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 279–289. | doi=10.1016/j.stem.2009.06.017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reproduction and somatic maintenance===
The mechanism of why reproduction inhibits lifespan with regards to multicellular organisms is still unclear. Although many models do illustrate an inverse relationship, and the theory makes sense from an evolutionary perspective, [[Cell signaling|the cellular mechanisms]] have yet to be explored. However, with regards to [[cellular replication]], the progressive shortening of telomeres is a mechanism which [[Hayflick limit|limits the amount of generations of a single cell may undergo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Shay JW, Wright WE | year = 2011 | title = Role of telomeres and telomerase in cancer | journal = Semin Cancer Biol. | volume = 21 | issue = 6 | pages = 349–353 | doi=10.1016/j.semcancer.2011.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, in unicellular organisms like ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'', the formation of [[extrachromosomal rDNA circle]]s (ERCs) in mother cells (but not daughter cells) upon every subsequent division is an identifiable type of DNA damage that is associated with replication. These ERCs accumulate over time and eventually trigger replicative senescence and death of the mother cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Kaeberlein M, McVey M, Guarente L | year = 1999 | title = The SIR2/3/4 complex and SIR2 alone promote longevity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by two different mechanisms| journal = Genes Dev. | volume = 13 | issue = 19| pages = 2570–2580}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence==

===Growth and aging===
There is a large body of evidence indicating the negative effects of growth on longevity across many species. As a general rule, individuals of a smaller size generally live longer than larger individuals of the same species.

==== Animal models ====
In [[Dwarfism|dwarf]] models of [[Mus musculus|mice]], such Snell or Ames mice, mutations have arisen, either rendering them incapable of producing IGF-1 or unable to have adequate receptors for IGF-1 uptake. Furthermore, mice injected with growth hormone have been shown to have progressive weight loss, roughing of the coat, [[Scoliosis|curvature of the spine]], [[Hypertrophy|enlargement of the organs]], kidney lesions and [[Cancer|increased cancer risk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Bartke A1, Brown-Borg H | year = 2004 | title = Life extension in the dwarf mouse | journal = Curr Top Dev Biol. | volume = 63 | issue =  | pages = 189–225| doi=10.1016/j.semcancer.2011.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect is also seen in different breeds of [[dogs]], where smaller breeds of dogs typically live significantly longer compared to their larger counterparts. Selectively bred for their small size, smaller dog breeds like the [[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahua]] (average lifespan of 15–20 years) have the B/B genotype for the IGF-1 [[haplotype]], reducing the amount of IGF-1 produced. Conversely, large dogs like the [[Great Dane]] (average lifespan of 6–8 years) are [[homozygous]] for the IGF-1 I [[allele]], which increases the amount of IGF-1 production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Sutter NB, Bustamante CD, Chase K, Gray MM | year = 2007| title =A Single IGF1 Allele Is a Major Determinant of Small Size in Dogs| journal = Science | volume = 316 | issue = 5821 | pages = 112–115 | doi=10.1126/science.1137045| bibcode =2007Sci...316..112S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Human models====
Initially, it was believed that growth hormone actually prolonged lifespan due to a 1990 study that indicated that injection of [[growth hormone]] to men over 60 years of age appeared to reverse various [[biomarkers]] implicated in aging, such as [[Sarcopenia|decreased muscle mass]], bone density, skin thickness, and increased adipose tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Rudman D1, Feller AG, Nagraj HS, Gergans GA; et al. | year = 1990| title =Effects of human growth hormone in men over 60 years old| journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 323 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–6 | doi=10.1056/NEJM199007053230101}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 1999 study found that administering growth hormone also significantly increased [[mortality rate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Takala J1, Ruokonen E, Webster NR, Nielsen MS, Zandstra DF, et al. | year = 1999| title =
Increased mortality associated with growth hormone treatment in critically ill adults| journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 341 | issue = 11 | pages = 785–792 | doi=10.1056/NEJM199909093411102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent [[Genome Sequencing|genomic studies]] have confirmed that the genes involved in growth hormone uptake and signaling are largely conserved across a plethora of species, such as yeast, nematodes, fruit flies, mice and humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Longo VD, Finch CE.| year = 2003| title =Evolutionary medicine: from dwarf model systems to healthy centenarians?| journal = Science | volume = 299 | issue = 5611 | pages = 1342–1346 | doi=10.1126/science.1077991}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies have also shown that individuals with [[Laron syndrome]], an [[autosomal recessive]] disorder resulting in dwarfism due to defects in growth hormone receptors, have increased lifespan. Additionally, these individuals have much lower [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidences]] of age-related diseases such as [[type 2 diabetes]] and cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Guevara-Aguirre J, Balasubramanian P, Guevara-Aguirre M, Wei M; et al. | year = 2011| title = Growth hormone receptor deficiency is associated with a major reduction in pro-aging signaling, cancer, and diabetes in humans | journal = Sci. Transl. Med. | volume = 3 | issue = 70 | pages = 70–83 | doi=10.1126/scitranslmed.3001845}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lastly, human [[centenarians]] around the world are disproportionately of [[short stature]], and have low levels of IGF-1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Govindaraju D, Atzmon G, Barzilai N. | year = 2015| title =Genetics, lifestyle and longevity: Lessons from centenarians.| journal = Appl Transl Genom.  | volume = 4| issue =  | pages = 23–32 | doi=10.1016/j.atg.2015.01.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reproduction and aging===
Numerous studies have found that lifespan is inversely correlated with both the total amount of offspring birthed, as well as the age at which females first gives birth, also known as primiparity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Descamps S, Boutin S, Berteaux D, Gaillard JM.| year = 2006| title =Best squirrels trade a long life for an early reproduction| journal = Proc Biol Sci   | volume = 273| issue = 1599 | pages = 2369–2374 | doi= 10.1098/rspb.2006.3588}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, it has been found that [[Sexual reproduction|reproduction]] is a costly mechanism that alters the [[Fatty acid metabolism|metabolism of fat]]. [[Lipids]] invested in reproduction would be unable to be allocated to support mechanisms involved in somatic maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Hansen M, Flatt T, Aguilaniu H.| year = 2013| title =Reproduction, fat metabolism, and life span: what is the connection?| journal = Cell Metab.| volume = 17| issue = 1 | pages = 10–19 | doi= 10.1016/j.cmet.2012.12.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==== Animal models ====

The disposable soma theory has been consistent with the majority of animal models. It was found in numerous animal studies that [[castration]] or [[Genetic disorder|genetic deformities]] of [[Reproductive system|reproduction organs]] was [[correlated]] with increased lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Drori D, Folman Y.| year = 1976| title =Environmental effects on longevity in the male rat: exercise, mating, castration and restricted feeding| journal = Exp Gerontol.| volume = 11| issue = 1 | pages = 25–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Flatt T| year = 2011| title =Survival costs of reproduction in ''Drosophila''.| journal = Exp Gerontol.| volume = 46| issue = 5 | pages = 369–375 | doi= 10.1016/j.exger.2010.10.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Hsin H, Kenyon C| year = 1999| title =Signals from the reproductive system regulate the lifespan of ''C. elegans''| journal =Nature| volume =399| issue = 6734 | pages = 362–366 | doi= 10.1038/20694| bibcode =1999Natur.399..362H}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in [[red squirrels]], it was found that females with an early primiparity achieved the highest immediate and lifetime reproductive success. However, it was also found that these same individuals had a decreased median and maximum lifespan. Specifically squirrels who mated earlier had a 22.4% rate of mortality until two years of age compared to a 16.5% rate of mortality in late breeders. In addition, these squirrels had an average maximum lifespan of 1035 days compared to an average maximum lifespan of 1245 days for squirrels that bred later.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

In another study, researchers selectively bred [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]] over three years to develop two different [[strain (biology)|strain]]s, an early-reproducing strain and a late-reproducing strain. The late-reproducing line had a significantly longer lifespan than the early-reproducing line. Even more telling was that when the researchers introduced a mutation in the [[Ovarian|ovarian-associated]] gene ''ovoD1'', resulting in defective [[oogenesis]], the differences in lifespan between the two lines disappeared. The researchers in this case concluded that "aging has evolved primarily because of the damaging effects of reproduction earlier in life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Sgrò CM, Partridge L| year = 1999| title = A delayed wave of death from reproduction in Drosophila.| journal =Science| volume =286| issue =5449 | pages = 2521–2524 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent aging researcher [[Steven N. Austad|Steven Austad]] also performed a large-scale [[ecological]] study on the [[coast]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in 1993. Austad isolated two [[opossum]] populations, one from the [[predator]]-infested mainland and one from the predator-absent nearby island of [[Sapelo]]. According to the disposable soma theory, a [[Genetic isolate|genetically isolated]] population subject to low environmentally-induced mortality would evolve delayed reproduction and aging. This is because without the pressure of predation, it would be evolutionarily advantageous to allocate more resources to somatic maintenance than reproduction, as early offspring mortality would be low. As predicted, even after controlling for predation, the isolated population had a longer lifespan, delayed primiparity, and reduced aging biomarkers such as tail [[collagen]] [[Cross linking|cross-linking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Austad, SN| year = 1993| title =Retarded senescence in an insular population of Virginia opossums (''Didelphis virginiana'')| journal = Journal of Zoology| volume = 229| issue = 4 | pages = 695–708 | doi= 10.1111/j.1469-7998.1993.tb02665.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Human models ====

In general, only a few studies exist in human models. It was found that [[Eunuch|castrated men]] live longer than their [[fertile]] counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Hamilton JB, Mestler GE| year = 1969| title =Mortality and survival: comparison of eunuchs with intact men and women in a mentally retarded population)| journal = J. Gerontol.| volume = 24| issue = 4 | pages = 395–411 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further studies found that in British women, primiparity was earliest in women who died early and latest in women who died at the oldest ages. Furthermore, increased number of children birthed was associated with a decreased lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Westendorp RG, Kirkwood TB| year = 1998| title =Human longevity at the cost of reproductive success |journal = Nature| volume = 396| issue = 6713 | pages = 743–746 | doi= 10.1038/25519}}&lt;/ref&gt; A final study found that female centenarians were more likely to have children in later life compared average, especially past the age of 40. The researchers discovered that 19.2% of female centenarians had their first child after the age of 40, compared to 5.5% of the rest of the female population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Perls TT, Alpert L, Fretts RC| year = 1997| title =Middle-aged mothers live longer |journal = Nature| volume = 389| issue = 6647 | pages = 133 | doi= 10.1038/38148| bibcode = 1997Natur.389..133P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relationship between cell damage and aging===
{{main|Free radical theory}}{{main|DNA damage theory of aging}}
[[File:Naked Mole Rat Eating.jpg|thumb|The [[naked mole rat]] has a [[naked mole rat#Longevity|disproportionately long life of 30 years]] through efficient cellular repair mechanisms.]]
There are numerous studies that support cellular damage, often due to a lack of somatic maintenance mechanisms, as a primary determinant for aging, and these studies have given rise to the [[free radical theory of aging]] and the [[DNA damage theory of aging]]. One study found that the cells of short-living rodents ''[[in vitro]]'' show much greater [[mutation]] rates and a general lack of genome surveillance compared to human cells and are far more susceptible to [[oxidative stress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Lorenzini A, Stamato T, Sell C. | year = 2011| title = The disposable soma theory revisited: time as a resource in the theories of aging | journal = Cell Cycle| volume = 10 | issue = 22 | pages = 3853–3856 | doi=10.4161/cc.10.22.18302}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Other studies have been conducted on the [[naked mole rat]], a rodent species with remarkable longevity (30 years), capable of outliving the [[brown rat]] (3 years) by [[Fold (higher-order function)|ten-fold]]. Additionally, almost no incidence cancer has ever been detected in naked mole rats. Nearly all of the differences found between these two organisms, which are otherwise rather genetically similar, was in somatic maintenance. Naked mole rats were found to have higher levels of [[superoxide dismutase]], a [[reactive oxygen species]] clearing [[antioxidant]]. In addition, naked mole rats had higher levels of [[base excision repair]], DNA damage response signaling, [[Homologous recombination|homologous recombination repair]], [[mismatch repair]], [[nucleotide excision repair]], and [[non-homologous end joining]]. In fact, many of these processes were near or exceeded human levels. Proteins from naked mole rats were also more resistant to [[oxidation]], [[misfolding]], [[ubiquitination]], and had increased [[Translation|translational fidelity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Azpurua J, Ke Z, Chen IX, Zhang Q, Ermolenko DN; et al. | year = 2013| title = Naked mole-rat has increased translational fidelity compared with the mouse, as well as a unique 28S ribosomal RNA cleavage | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A| volume = 110 | issue = 43 | pages =17350–17355 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1313473110| bibcode =2013PNAS..11017350A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further studies have been conducted on patients with [[Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome]] (HGPS), a condition that leads to premature aging. Patients with HGPS typically age about seven times faster than average and usually succumb to the disease in their early teens. Patients with HGPS have cellular defects, specifically in the [[Lamin A protein|lamin proteins]], which regulate the organization of the [[Nuclear lamina|lamina]] and [[nuclear envelope]] for [[mitosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Pollex RL1, Hegele RA | year = 2004| title = Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome | journal = Clin. Genet.| volume = 66| issue = 5 | pages =375–381 | doi=10.1111/j.1399-0004.2004.00315.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Lastly, as mentioned previously, it has been found that the suppression of autophagy is associated with reduced lifespan, while stimulation is associated with extended lifespan. Activated in times of [[caloric restriction]], autophagy is a process that prevents cellular damage through clearance and [[recycling]] of damaged proteins and [[organelles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Glick D1, Barth S, Macleod KF. | year = 2010| title = Autophagy: cellular and molecular mechanisms| journal = J. Pathol. | volume = 221 | issue = 1 | pages =3–12| doi=10.1002/path.2697}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism==
One of the main weaknesses of the disposable soma theory is that it does not postulate any specific cellular mechanisms to which an organism shifts energy to somatic repair over reproduction. Instead, it only offers an [[Evolution|evolutionary perspective]] on why aging may occur due to reproduction. Therefore, parts of it are rather limited outside of the field of [[evolutionary biology]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt;

===Caloric restriction===
{{main|Calorie restriction#Sirtuin-mediated mechanism}}
[[File:Soma Disposable.png|thumb|Schematic showing the reallocation of energy investment towards [[DNA repair|self-repair]] during [[caloric restriction]].]]
Critics have pointed out the supposed [[Inconsistency|inconsistencies]] of the disposable soma theory due to the observed effects of caloric restriction, which is correlated with increased lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Blagosklonny, MV| year = 2010| title = Solving puzzles of aging: From disposable soma to signal-transduction pathways| journal = Russ J Gen Chem. | volume = 80 | issue = | pages =1407}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it activates autophagy, according to classical disposable soma principles, with less [[Caloric|caloric intake]], there would less total energy to be distributed towards somatic maintenance, and decreased lifespan would be observed (or at least the positive autophagic effects would be balanced out). However, Kirkwood, alongside his collaborator Darryl P. Shanley, assert that caloric restriction triggers an adaptive mechanism which causes the organism to shift a higher proportion of resources to somatic maintenance, away from reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Shanley DP, Kirkwood TB.| year = 2000| title = Calorie restriction and aging: a life-history analysis.| journal = Evolution | volume = 54 | issue =3 | pages =1407}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory is supported by multiple studies, which show that caloric restriction typically results in [[Sterility (physiology)|impaired fertility]], but leave an otherwise healthy organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Holliday R.| year = 2000| title = Food, reproduction and longevity: is the extended lifespan of calorie-restricted animals an evolutionary adaptation?| journal = BioEssays | volume = 10 | issue =4 | pages =125–127|doi=10.1002/bies.950100408}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Masoro EJ, Austad SN.| year = 1996| title = The evolution of the antiaging action of dietary restriction: a hypothesis.| journal = J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci | volume = 51 | issue =6 | pages =387–391}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionarily, an organism would want to delay reproduction to when resources were more plentiful. During a resource-barren period, it would evolutionarily unwise to invest resources in progeny that would be unlikely to survive in [[famine]]. Mechanistically, the [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD]]-dependent [[Deacetylate|deacetylase]] [[Sirtuin 1]] (SIRT-1) is upregulated during low-nutrient periods. SIRT-1 increases [[insulin sensitivity]], decreases the amount of [[inflammatory cytokine]]s, stimulates autophagy, and activates FOXO, the aforementioned protein involved in activating stress response genes. SIRT-1 is also found to result in decreased fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Cantó C, Auwerx J.| year = 2009| title = Caloric restriction, SIRT1 and longevity.| journal =Trends Endocrinol Metab| volume = 20 | issue =7 | pages =325–331|doi=10.1016/j.tem.2009.03.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In additional to differential [[wikt:partitioning|partitioning]] of energy allocation during caloric restriction, less caloric intake would result in less metabolic waste in the forms of [[free radicals]] like [[hydrogen peroxide]], [[superoxide]] and [[hydroxyl radicals]], which damage important cellular components, particularly [[mitochondria]]. Elevated levels of free radicals in mice has been correlated with neurodegeneration, [[Myocardial|myocardial injury]], [[Anemia|severe anemia]], and premature death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Pérez VI, Bokov A, Van Remmen H, Mele J; et al.| year = 2009| title = Is the oxidative stress theory of aging dead?| journal =Biochim Biophys Acta| volume = 1790 | issue =10 | pages =1005–1014|doi=10.1016/j.bbagen.2009.06.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Grandmother hypothesis===
{{main|Menopause#Evolutionary rationale}}
Another primary criticism of the disposable soma theory is that it fails to account for why women tend to live longer than their male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Ginter E, Simko V | year = 2013| title = Women live longer than men| journal = Bratisl Lek Listy.  | volume = 114 | issue = 2 | pages =45–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterall, females invest significantly more resources into reproduction and according to the classical disposable soma principles, this would compromise energy diverted to somatic maintenance. However, this can be reconciled with the [[grandmother hypothesis]]. The Grandmother Hypothesis states that [[menopause]] comes about into older women in order to restrict the time of reproduction as a protective mechanism. This would allow women to live longer and increase the amount of care they could provide to their [[grandchildren]], increasing their evolutionary fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Hawkes K | year = 2003| title = Grandmothers and the evolution of human longevity| journal = Am. J. Hum. Biol.| volume =15 | issue =3  | pages =380–400| doi= 10.1002/ajhb.10156}}&lt;/ref&gt; And so, although women do invest a greater proportion of resources into reproduction during their [[Age and female fertility|fertile years]], their overall reproductive period is significantly shorter than men, who are able of reproduction during and even beyond [[middle age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Vinicius L, Mace R, Migliano A| year = 2014| title = Variation in Male Reproductive Longevity across Traditional Societies| journal = PLoS One| volume =9 | issue =11  | pages =e112236| doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0112236| bibcode =2014PLoSO...9k2236V}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, males invest more resources into growth, and have significantly higher levels of IGF-1 compared to females, which is correlated with decreased lifespan. Other variables such as increased [[Testosterone|testosterone levels]] in males are not accounted for. Increased testosterone is often associated with reckless behaviour, which may lead to a high accidental death rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Celec P, Ostatníková D, Hodosy J. | year = 2015| title = On the effects of testosterone on brain behavioral functions| journal = Front. Neurosci.| volume =9 | issue =  | pages =12| doi=10.3389/fnins.2015.00012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contradicting models === 
A few [[Contradiction|contradicting]] animal models weaken the validity of the disposable soma theory. This includes studies done on the aforementioned naked mole rats. In these studies, it was found that reproductive naked mole rats actually show significantly increased lifespans compared to non-reproductive individuals, which contradicts the principles of diposable soma. However, although these naked mole rats are [[mammalian]], they are highly [[atypical]] in terms of aging studies and may not serve as the best model for humans. For example, naked mole rats have a disproportionately high longevity quotient and live in [[Eusociality|eusocial societies]], where breeding is usually designated to a [[Eusociality#In mammals|queen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Dammann P, Burda H | year = 2006| title =Sexual activity and reproduction delay ageing in a mammal.| journal = Curr. Biol.| volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 117–118 | doi=10.1016/j.cub.2006.02.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sex biases and environment ===
The disposable soma theory is tested disproportionately on female organisms for the relationship between reproduction and aging, as [[Parental investment#Females as the more investing sex|females carry a greater burden in reproduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Hammers M, Richardson DS, Burke T, Komdeur J. | year = 2013| title = The impact of reproductive investment and early-life environmental conditions on senescence: support for the disposable soma hypothesis.| journal = J Evol Biol | volume = 26| issue = 9 | pages = 1999–2007| doi=10.1111/jeb.12204}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, for the relationship between growth and aging, studies are disproportionately conducted on males, to minimize the [[Estrogen|hormonal fluctuations]] that occur with [[Menstrual cycle|menstrual cycling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Wu JJ, Liu J, Chen EB, Wang JJ; et al. | year = 2013| title = Increased mammalian lifespan and a segmental and tissue-specific slowing of aging after genetic reduction of mTOR expression| journal = Cell Rep. | volume = 4| issue = 5 | pages = 913–920| doi=10.1016/j.celrep.2013.07.030}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, [[aging#Biological basis|genetic]] and [[Gene–environment interaction|environmental factors]], rather than reproductive patterns, may explain the variations in human lifespan. For example, studies have shown that [[Poverty|poorer individuals]], to whom nutritious food and [[medical care]] is less accessible, typically have higher birth rates and earlier primiparity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Murray, S. | year = 2006| title = Poverty and health| journal = CMAJ | volume = 174| issue = 7 | pages = 923| doi=10.1503/cmaj.060235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Drakoo wave energy converter'''  is a technological device that uses the motion of [[ocean surface waves]] to generate electricity.

== Principle ==
The Drakoo WEC does not fall under any of the usual [[Wave Energy Converter|wave energy converter]] classifications: its working principle, based on a twin-chamber oscillating water column system, is to transform waves into a continuous water flow which drives a hydro turbine generator.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://marineenergy.biz/2016/12/29/drakoo-wave-device-generates-first-power-china/|title=Drakoo wave device generates first power in China|work=Marine Energy|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development history ==
after being patented in 2008, the Drakoo technology has successfully been tested in NTU lab and, subsequently, in the deep wave flume of NAREC in 2012(UK).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://report2014.ocean-energy-systems.org/country-reports/singapore/technology-demonstration/|title=Ocean Energy System Annual Report 2014|last=|first=|date=|website=Ocean Energy Systems|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 23, 2016, Hann Ocean Energy, the Singapore wave developer company which invented and patented the technology, announced the first successful power production during a trial in its testing facility in [[Nantong]], with a peak power output of 3.8&amp;nbsp;kW at a wave height of 0.6m.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://marineenergy.biz/2016/12/29/drakoo-wave-device-generates-first-power-china/|title=Drakoo wave device generates first power in China|work=Marine Energy|access-date=2018-04-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technology continuously increased its performances along the years, reaching firstly a peak output power of 9.3&amp;nbsp;kW  in November 2017 and of 11.2&amp;nbsp;kW in March 2018. Moreover, during the [[World Future Energy Summit]] 2018, in Abu Dhabi, Hann Ocean Energy reported about sales inquiries from the Persian Gulf for the application of the Drakoo WEC for wellhead platforms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2763">The '''Dukhin number''' ('''{{math|Du}}''') is a dimensionless quantity that characterizes the contribution of the [[surface conductivity]] to various [[electrokinetic]] and electroacoustic effects, as well as to [[electrical conductivity]] and [[permittivity]] of fluid [[heterogeneous]] systems. 

==Overview==
It was introduced by Lyklema in “Fundamentals of Interface and Colloid Science”.&lt;ref&gt;Lyklema, J.J. "Fundamentals of Interface and Colloid Science", vol.2, page.3.208, 1995 {{ISBN|978-0-12-460524-4}}.&lt;!-- 10.1016/S1874-5679(06)80006-1? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  A recent IUPAC Technical Report used this term explicitly and detailed several means of measurement in physical systems.&lt;ref name='PAC'&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Delgado |first1=A. V. |last2=González-Caballero |first2=F. |last3=Hunter |first3=R. J. |last4=Koopal |first4=L. K. |last5=Lyklema |first5=J.  |year=2005 |title=Measurement and Interpretation of Electrokinetic Phenomena (IUPAC Technical Report) |journal=[[Pure and Applied Chemistry]] |volume=77 |issue=10 |pages=1753–1805 |doi=10.1351/pac200577101753|url=http://digibug.ugr.es/bitstream/10481/29099/1/DelgadoMeasurements.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dukhin number is a ratio of the [[surface conductivity]] &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;\kappa^{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt; to the fluid bulk electrical conductivity K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; multiplied by particle size ''a'':

:&lt;math&gt; {\rm Du} = \frac{\kappa^{\sigma}}{{\Kappa_m}a}.&lt;/math&gt;

There is another expression of this number that is valid when the surface conductivity is associated only with ions motion above the [[slipping plane]] in the [[double layer (interfacial)|double layer]]. In this case, the value of the surface conductivity depends on ζ-potential, which leads to the following expression for the Dukhin number for symmetrical electrolyte with equal ions [[diffusion coefficient]]:

:&lt;math&gt; {\rm Du} = \frac{2(1+3m/z^2)}{{\kappa}a}\left(\mathrm{cosh}\frac{zF\zeta}{2RT}-1\right),&lt;/math&gt;

where the parameter ''m'' characterizes the contribution of [[electro-osmosis]] into motion of ions within the double layer

:&lt;math&gt; m = \frac{2\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_m R^2T^2}{3\eta F^2 D}.&lt;/math&gt;

* ''F'' is [[Faraday constant]]
* ''T'' is [[absolute temperature]]
* ''R'' is [[gas constant]]
* ''C'' is ions concentration in bulk
* ''z'' is [[ion]] [[valence (chemistry)|valency]]
* ζ is [[electrokinetic potential]]
* ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is [[vacuum]] [[dielectric]] [[permittivity]]
* ε&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is fluid dielectric permittivity

'''Earth's energy budget''' accounts for the balance between the [[energy]] Earth receives from the Sun,&lt;ref&gt;Earth's internal heat and other small effects, that are indeed taken into consideration, are thousand times smaller; see below&lt;/ref&gt; the energy Earth radiates back into [[outer space]] after having been distributed throughout the five components of Earth's [[climate system]] and having thus powered the so-called '''Earth’s heat engine'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|IPCC AR5 WG1 Glossary|2013}} [http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_AnnexIII_FINAL.pdf "energy budget (of the earth)"]&lt;/ref&gt;  This system is made up of earth's [[Hydrosphere|water]], [[cryosphere|ice]], [[Earth's Atmosphere|atmosphere]], [[Lithosphere|rocky crust]], and all [[biosphere|living things]].&lt;ref name="IPCC glossary"&gt;[http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/syr/en/annexes.html AR4 SYR Synthesis Report Annexes].

Received [[radiation]] is unevenly distributed over the planet, because the Sun heats equatorial regions more than polar regions. The atmosphere and ocean work non-stop to even out solar heating imbalances through [[evaporation]] of surface water, convection, rainfall, winds, and ocean circulation. Earth is very close to being in [[radiative equilibrium]], the situation where the incoming solar energy is balanced by an equal flow of heat to space; under that condition, global temperatures will be ''relatively'' stable. Globally, over the course of the year, the Earth system—land surfaces, oceans, and atmosphere—absorbs and then radiates back to space an average of about 240 watts of solar power per square meter. Anything that increases or decreases the amount of incoming or outgoing energy will change global temperatures in response.&lt;ref name="Lindsey 2009"&gt;{{cite journal

However, Earth's energy balance and heat fluxes depend on many factors, such as atmospheric composition (mainly aerosols and greenhouse gases), the [[albedo]] (reflectivity) of surface properties, cloud cover and vegetation and land use patterns.

Changes in surface temperature due to Earth's energy budget do not occur instantaneously, due to the [[inertia]] of the [[ocean]]s and the [[cryosphere]]. The net heat flux is buffered primarily by becoming part of the [[ocean heat content|ocean's heat content]], until a new equilibrium state is established between radiative forcings and the climate response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Energy budget==
[[File:Earth_heat_balance_Sankey_diagram.svg|thumb|250px|left|A [[Sankey diagram]] illustrating the Earth's energy budget described in this section &amp;mdash; line thickness is linearly proportional to relative amount of energy.&lt;ref name="energy_budget" /&gt;]]
In spite of the enormous transfers of energy into and from the Earth, it maintains a relatively constant temperature because, as a whole, there is little net gain or loss: Earth emits via atmospheric and terrestrial radiation (shifted to longer electromagnetic wavelengths) to space about the same amount of energy as it receives via insolation (all forms of electromagnetic radiation).

To quantify Earth's ''heat budget'' or ''heat balance'', let the insolation received at the top of the atmosphere be 100 units (100 units = about 1,360 watts per square meter facing the sun), as shown in the accompanying illustration. Called the [[albedo]] of Earth, around 35 units are reflected back to space: 27 from the top of clouds, 2 from snow and ice-covered areas, and 6 by other parts of the atmosphere. The 65 remaining units are absorbed: 14 within the atmosphere and 51 by the Earth’s surface. These 51 units are radiated to space in the form of terrestrial radiation: 17 directly radiated to space and 34 absorbed by the atmosphere (19 through latent heat of condensation, 9 via convection and turbulence, and 6 directly absorbed). The 48 units absorbed by the atmosphere (34 units from terrestrial radiation and 14 from insolation) are finally radiated back to space. These 65 units (17 from the ground and 48 from the atmosphere) balance the 65 units absorbed from the sun in order to maintain zero net gain of energy by the Earth.&lt;ref name="energy_budget"&gt;

===Incoming radiant energy (shortwave)===

The total amount of energy received per second at the top of [[Earth's atmosphere]] (TOA) is measured in [[watt]]s and is given by the [[solar constant]] times the cross-sectional area of the Earth. Because the surface area of a sphere is four times the cross-sectional surface area of a sphere (i.e. the area of a circle), the average TOA flux is one quarter of the solar constant and so is approximately 340&amp;nbsp;W/m².&lt;ref name="NASA CERES" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Earth's radiation balance and its representation in CMIP5 models|publisher=Copernicus|year=2013|author1=Wild, Martin |author2=Folini, Doris |author3=Schär, Christoph |author4=Loeb, Norman |author5=Dutton, Ellsworth |author6=König-Langlo, Gert |bibcode=2013EGUGA..15.1286W}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the absorption varies with location as well as with diurnal, seasonal and annual variations, the numbers quoted are long-term averages, typically averaged from multiple satellite measurements.&lt;ref name="NASA CERES" /&gt;

Of the ~340&amp;nbsp;W/m² of solar radiation received by the Earth, an average of ~77&amp;nbsp;W/m² is reflected back to space by clouds and the atmosphere and ~23&amp;nbsp;W/m² is reflected by the surface [[albedo]], leaving ~240&amp;nbsp;W/m² of solar energy input to the Earth's energy budget. This gives the earth a mean net albedo of 0.29.&lt;ref name="NASA CERES" /&gt;

===Earth's internal heat and other small effects===
The [[Earth's internal heat budget|geothermal heat flux]] from the Earth's interior is estimated to be 47 [[terawatt]]s.&lt;ref name=Davies&gt;Davies, J. H., &amp; Davies, D. R. (2010). Earth's surface heat flux. Solid Earth, 1(1), 5–24.&lt;/ref&gt; This comes to 0.087&amp;nbsp;watt/square metre, which represents only 0.027% of Earth's total energy budget at the surface, which is dominated by 173,000 terawatts of incoming [[solar radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ISBN=978-0-470-94341-0|author=Archer, D.|year=2012|title=Global Warming: Understanding the Forecast}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[World energy consumption|Human production of energy]] is even lower, at an estimated 18 TW.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

[[Photosynthesis]] has a larger effect: [[photosynthetic efficiency]] turns up to 2% of incoming sunlight into [[primary production|biomass]], for a total photosynthetic productivity of earth between ~1500–2250 TW (~1%+/-0.26% solar energy hitting the Earth's surface).&lt;ref name="PLoS"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pisciotta JM, Zou Y, Baskakov IV |title=Light-Dependent Electrogenic Activity of Cyanobacteria |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=e10821 |year=2010 |pmid=20520829 |pmc=2876029 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0010821|bibcode=2010PLoSO...510821P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other minor sources of energy are usually ignored in these calculations, including accretion of [[interplanetary dust]] and [[solar wind]], light from stars other than the Sun and the thermal radiation from space. Earlier, [[Joseph Fourier]] had claimed that deep space radiation was significant in a paper often cited as the first on the [[greenhouse effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=William M. Connolley's page about Fourier 1827: MEMOIRE sur les temperatures du globe terrestre et des espaces planetaires|url=http://www.wmconnolley.org.uk/sci/fourier_1827/|last=Connolley|first=William M.|authorlink=William Connolley|publisher=William M. Connolley|date=18 May 2003|accessdate=5 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Longwave radiation===
{{main|Outgoing longwave radiation}}
Longwave radiation is usually defined as outgoing [[infrared]] energy leaving the planet. However, the atmosphere absorbs parts initially, or cloud cover can reflect radiation. Generally, heat energy is transported between the planet's surface layers (land and ocean) to the atmosphere, transported via [[evapotranspiration]] and [[latent heat]] fluxes or [[thermal conduction|conduction]]/[[convection]] processes.&lt;ref name="NASA CERES" /&gt;  Ultimately, energy is radiated in the form of longwave [[Infrared#Earth as an infrared emitter|infrared radiation]] back into space.

Recent satellite observations indicate additional precipitation, which is sustained by increased energy leaving the surface through evaporation (the latent heat flux), offsetting increases in longwave flux to the surface.&lt;ref name=SatObsEva /&gt;

==Earth's energy imbalance==
If the incoming energy flux is not equal to the outgoing energy flux, net heat is added to or lost by the planet (if the incoming flux is larger or smaller than the outgoing respectively).

===Indirect measurement===
An imbalance must show in something on Earth warming or cooling (depending on the direction of the imbalance), and the ocean being the larger [[thermal reservoir]] on Earth, is a prime candidate for measurements.

Earth's energy imbalance measurements provided by [[Argo (oceanography)|Argo floats]] have detected an accumulation of [[ocean heat content]] (OHC). The estimated imbalance was measured during a deep [[solar minimum]] of 2005–2010 to be 0.58 ± 0.15&amp;nbsp;W/m².&lt;ref name="Imbalance"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=James Hansen |author2=Makiko Sato |author3=Pushker Kharecha |author4=Karina von Schuckmann |publisher=NASA|date=January 2012|url=http://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/briefs/hansen_16/|title=Earth's Energy Imbalance}}&lt;/ref&gt; This level of detail cannot be inferred directly from measurements of surface energy fluxes, which have combined uncertainties of the order of ± 17&amp;nbsp;W/m².&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = An update on Earth's energy balance in light of the latest global observations|url = http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v5/n10/full/ngeo1580.html|journal = Nature Geoscience|date = 2012-10-01|issn = 1752-0894|pages = 691–696|volume = 5|issue = 10|doi = 10.1038/ngeo1580|first = Graeme L.|last = Stephens|first2 = Juilin|last2 = Li|first3 = Martin|last3 = Wild|first4 = Carol Anne|last4 = Clayson|first5 = Norman|last5 = Loeb|first6 = Seiji|last6 = Kato|first7 = Tristan|last7 = L'Ecuyer|first8 = Paul W. |last8 = Stackhouse Jr.|first9 = Matthew|last9 = Lebsock|bibcode = 2012NatGe...5..691S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Direct measurement ===
Several [[satellite]]s indirectly measure the energy absorbed and radiated by Earth and by inference the energy imbalance. The [[NASA]] [[Earth Radiation Budget Satellite|Earth Radiation Budget Experiment]] (ERBE) project involves three such satellites: the [[Earth Radiation Budget Satellite]] (ERBS), launched October 1984; NOAA-9, launched December 1984; and NOAA-10, launched September 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[http://icp.giss.nasa.gov/education/radforce/ Effect of the Sun's Energy on the Ocean and Atmosphere (1997)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today NASA's satellite instruments, provided by CERES, part of the NASA's [[Earth Observing System]] (EOS), are designed to measure both solar-reflected and Earth-emitted radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= B.A. Wielicki |display-authors=etal |title=Mission to Planet Earth: Role of Clouds and Radiation in Climate |journal=Bull. Am. Meteorol. Soc. |volume=77 |issue= 5 |year=1996 |pages=853–868 |doi= 10.1175/1520-0477(1996)077&lt;0853:CATERE&gt;2.0.CO;2 |bibcode = 1996BAMS...77..853W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural greenhouse effect==
[[File:Diagram showing the Earth's energy budget, which includes the greenhouse effect (NASA).png|thumb|right|alt=refer to caption and image description|250px|Diagram showing the energy budget of Earth's atmosphere, which includes the greenhouse effect]]
{{See also|Greenhouse effect}}
The major [[atmosphere of Earth|atmospheric]] gases ([[oxygen]] and [[nitrogen]]) are transparent to incoming sunlight but are also transparent to outgoing thermal ([[infrared]]) radiation. However, [[water vapor#Water vapor in Earth.27s atmosphere|water vapor]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[methane]] and other trace gases are opaque to many [[wavelength]]s of thermal radiation. The Earth's surface radiates the net equivalent of 17 percent of the incoming [[solar radiation|solar energy]] in the form of thermal infrared. However, the amount that directly escapes to space is only about 12 percent of incoming solar energy. The remaining fraction, 5 to 6 percent, is absorbed by the atmosphere by [[greenhouse gas]] [[molecule]]s.&lt;ref name="lindsey greenhouse effect p6"&gt;Edited quote from public-domain source: {{citation

[[File:CO2 H2O absorption atmospheric gases unique pattern energy wavelengths of energy transparent to others.png|500px|thumb|Atmospheric gases only absorb some wavelengths of energy but are transparent to others. The absorption patterns of water vapor (blue peaks) and carbon dioxide (pink peaks) overlap in some wavelengths. Carbon dioxide is not as strong a greenhouse gas as water vapor, but it absorbs energy in wavelengths (12–15 micrometres) that water vapor does not, partially closing the "window" through which heat radiated by the surface would normally escape to space. (Illustration NASA, Robert Rohde)&lt;ref name="NASA climate forcings"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/EnergyBalance/page7.php|title=NASA: Climate Forcings and Global Warming|date=January 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
When greenhouse gas molecules absorb thermal infrared energy, their temperature rises. Those gases then radiate an increased amount of thermal infrared energy in all directions. Heat radiated upward continues to encounter greenhouse gas molecules; those molecules also absorb the heat, and their temperature rises and the amount of heat they radiate increases. The atmosphere thins with [[altitude]], and at roughly 5–6&amp;nbsp;[[kilometre]]s, the concentration of greenhouse gases in the overlying atmosphere is so thin that heat can escape to space.&lt;ref name="lindsey greenhouse effect p6"/&gt;

Because greenhouse gas molecules radiate infrared energy in all directions, some of it spreads downward and ultimately returns to the Earth's surface, where it is absorbed. The Earth's surface temperature is thus higher than it would be if it were heated only by direct solar heating. This supplemental heating is the natural greenhouse effect.&lt;ref name="lindsey greenhouse effect p6"/&gt; It is as if the Earth is covered by a blanket that allows high frequency radiation (sunlight) to enter, but slows the rate at which the low frequency infrared radiant energy emitted by the Earth leaves.

==Climate sensitivity==
{{Main|Radiative forcing}}
A change in the incident radiated portion of the energy budget is referred to as a [[radiative forcing]].

[[Climate sensitivity]] is the [[steady state]] change in the equilibrium temperature as a result of changes in the energy budget.

===Climate forcings and global warming===
[[File:NASA Hansen Aerosol effect on expected energy imbalance Earth budget.gif|right|300px|thumb|Expected Earth energy imbalance for three choices of aerosol climate forcing.

Climate forcings are changes that cause temperatures to rise or fall, disrupting the energy balance. Natural climate forcings include changes in the Sun's brightness, [[Milankovitch cycles]] (small variations in the shape of Earth's orbit and its axis of rotation that occur over thousands of years) and volcanic eruptions that inject light-reflecting particles as high as the [[stratosphere]]. Man-made forcings include particle pollution ([[aerosols]]) that absorb and reflect incoming sunlight; [[deforestation]], which changes how the surface reflects and absorbs sunlight; and the rising concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, which decreases the rate at which heat is radiated to space.

A forcing can trigger [[feedback]]s that intensify ([[positive feedback]]) or weaken ([[negative feedback]]) the original forcing. For example, [[Arctic sea ice decline|loss of ice]] at the poles, which makes them less reflective, causes greater absorption of energy and so increases the rate at which the ice melts, is an example of a positive feedback.&lt;ref name="NASA climate forcings" /&gt;

The observed planetary energy imbalance during the [[solar cycle 24|recent solar minimum]] shows that solar forcing of climate, although natural and significant, is overwhelmed by anthropogenic climate forcing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/briefs/hansen_16/|title=NASA GISS: Science Brief: Earth's Energy Imbalance|website=www.giss.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, [[NASA]] scientists reported that to stop [[global warming]] atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; content would have to be reduced to 350&amp;nbsp;ppm or less, assuming all other climate forcings were fixed. The impact of anthropogenic [[aerosols]] has not been quantified, but individual aerosol types are thought to have substantial heating and cooling effects.&lt;ref name="Imbalance" /&gt;

[[File:Globespin.gif|thumb|An animation of Earth's rotation around the planet's axis]]
[[File:Earth Rotation (Nepal, Himalayas).jpg|thumb|This [[long-exposure photography|long-exposure photo]] of the [[Northern celestial hemisphere|northern]] [[night sky]] over the [[Nepal]]i [[Himalayas]] shows the [[star trail|apparent paths]] of the stars as Earth rotates.]]

'''Earth's rotation''' is the [[rotation]] of [[Earth|Planet Earth]] around its own [[axial tilt|axis]]. Earth rotates [[east]]ward, in [[retrograde and prograde motion|prograde motion]]. As viewed from the north [[pole star]] [[Polaris]], Earth turns [[clockwise|counter clockwise]].

The [[North Pole]], also known as the Geographic North Pole or Terrestrial North Pole, is the point in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] where Earth's axis of rotation meets its surface. This point is distinct from Earth's [[North Magnetic Pole]]. The [[South Pole]] is the other point where Earth's axis of rotation intersects its surface, in [[Antarctica]].

Earth rotates once in about 24 hours with respect to the [[Sun]], but once every 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4 seconds with respect to the stars ([[#Stellar and sidereal day|see below]]). Earth's rotation is slowing slightly with time; thus, a day was shorter in the past. This is due to the [[tidal acceleration|tidal effects]] the [[Moon]] has on Earth's rotation. [[Atomic clock]]s show that a modern day is longer by about 1.7 [[millisecond]]s than a century ago,&lt;ref name="McCarthySeidelmann2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dennis D. McCarthy|author2=Kenneth P.

Analysis of historical astronomical records shows a slowing trend of about 2.3 milliseconds per century since the [[8th century BC|8th century BCE]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |last=Stephenson |first=F.

==History==
Among the ancient Greeks, several of the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] school believed in the rotation of the earth rather than the apparent diurnal rotation of the heavens. Perhaps the first was [[Philolaus]] (470–385 BCE), though his system was complicated, including a [[Counter-Earth|counter-earth]] rotating daily about a central fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=George Bosworth|last=Burch|title=The Counter-Earth|journal=Osiris|volume=11|year=1954|pages=267–294|jstor=301675|doi=10.1086/368583}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more conventional picture was that supported by [[Hicetas]], [[Heraclides Ponticus|Heraclides]] and [[Ecphantus]] in the fourth century BCE who assumed that the earth rotated but did not suggest that the earth revolved about the sun. In the third century BCE, [[Aristarchus of Samos]] suggested the [[Heliocentrism|sun's central place]].

However, [[Aristotle]] in the fourth century BCE criticized the ideas of Philolaus as being based on theory rather than observation. He established the idea of a sphere of fixed stars that rotated about the earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Aristotle|title=Of the Heavens|at=Book II, Ch 13. 1.|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/heavens.2.ii.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was accepted by most of those who came after, in particular [[Claudius Ptolemy]] (2nd century CE), who thought the earth would be devastated by gales if it rotated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Almagest Book I, Chapter 8|author=Ptolemy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 499 CE, the [[Indian astronomy|Indian astronomer]] [[Aryabhata]] wrote that the spherical earth rotates about its axis daily, and that the apparent movement of the stars is a relative motion caused by the rotation of the Earth. He provided the following analogy: "Just as a man in a boat going in one direction sees the stationary things on the bank as moving in the opposite direction, in the same way to a man at [[Lanka]] the fixed stars appear to be going westward."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.new1.dli.ernet.in/data1/upload/insa/INSA_1/20005b61_51.pdf] {{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kim Plofker|title=Mathematics in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DHvThPNp9yMC&amp;pg=PA71|year=2009|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-12067-6|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 10th century, some [[Astronomy in medieval Islam|Muslim astronomers]] accepted that the Earth rotates around its axis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 108| issue = 67| pages = 762| author = Alessandro Bausani| title = Cosmology and Religion in Islam| journal = Scientia/Rivista di Scienza| date = 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[al-Biruni]], [[Abu Sa'id al-Sijzi]] (d. circa 1020) invented an [[astrolabe]] called ''al-zūraqī'' based on the idea believed by some of his contemporaries "that the motion we see is due to the Earth's movement and not to that of the sky."&lt;ref name=young /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = SUNY Press| isbn = 9781438414195| last = Nasr| first = Seyyed Hossein| title = An Introduction to Islamic Cosmological Doctrines| date = 1 January 1993|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prevalence of this view is further confirmed by a reference from the 13th century which states: "According to the geometers [or engineers] (''muhandisīn''), the earth is in constant circular motion, and what appears to be the motion of the heavens is actually due to the motion of the earth and not the stars."&lt;ref name=young&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 9780521028875| editor-last1 = Young| editor-first1 = M.

In medieval Europe, [[Thomas Aquinas]] accepted Aristotle's view&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Thomas|last=Aquinas|title=Commentaria in libros Aristotelis De caelo et Mundo|at=Lib II, cap XIV}} trans in {{cite book|title=A Source Book in Medieval Science|editor-first=Edward|editor-last=Grant|year=1974|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|ref=harv}} pages 496–500&lt;/ref&gt; and so, reluctantly, did [[John Buridan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Quaestiones super libris quattuo De Caelo et mundo|first=John|last=Buridan|year=1942|pages=226–232}} in {{harvnb|Grant|1974|pp=500–503}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nicole Oresme]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Le livre du ciel et du monde|first=Nicole|last=Oresme|pages=519–539}} in {{harvnb|Grant|1974|pp=503–510}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the fourteenth century. Not until [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] in 1543 adopted a [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] world system did the contemporary understanding of earth's rotation begin to be established. Copernicus pointed out that if the movement of the earth is violent, then the movement of the stars must be very much more so. He acknowledged the contribution of the Pythagoreans and pointed to examples of relative motion. For Copernicus this was the first step in establishing the simpler pattern of planets circling a central sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Nicolas|last=Copernicus|title=On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres|at=Book I, Chap 5–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tycho Brahe]], who produced accurate observations on which [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] based his [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|laws]], used Copernicus's work as the basis of a [[Tychonic system|system]] assuming a stationary earth. In 1600, [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] strongly supported the earth's rotation in his treatise on the earth's magnetism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=William|last=Gilbert|title=De Magnete, On the Magnet and Magnetic Bodies, and on the Great Magnet the Earth|pages=313–347|url=https://archive.org/stream/williamgilbertof00gilb#page/316 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and thereby influenced many of his contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Reception of Copernicus' Heliocentric Theory|editor= J.

Dobrzycki|1972|p=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; A century after Copernicus, [[Riccioli]] disputed the model of a rotating earth due to the lack of then-observable eastward deflections in falling bodies;&lt;ref&gt;[[Almagestum novum]], chapter nine, cited in {{cite journal|url=https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1103/1103.2057.pdf|title=126 arguments concerning the motion of the earth. GIOVANNI BATTISTA RICCIOLI in his 1651 ALMAGESTUM NOVUM|first=Christopher M.|last=Graney|year=2012|journal=Journal for the History of Astronomy|at=volume 43, pages 215–226}}&lt;/ref&gt; such deflections would later be called the [[Coriolis effect]]. However, the contributions of Kepler, [[Galileo]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] gathered support for the theory of the rotation of the Earth.

===Empirical tests===
Earth's rotation implies that the [[equatorial bulge|Equator bulges]] and the [[geographical pole]]s are flattened. In his ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'', Newton predicted this [[flattening]] would occur in the ratio of 1:230, and pointed to the [[pendulum]] measurements taken by [[Jean Richer|Richer]] in 1673 as corroboration of the change in [[gravity]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Isaac |last=Newton |title=Newton's Principia |page=412 |year=1846 |translator=A. Motte |url=https://archive.org/stream/100878576#page/412}}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[History of Geodesy#Europe|initial measurements]] of [[meridian arc|meridian lengths]] by [[Jean Picard|Picard]] and [[Jacques Cassini|Cassini]] at the end of the 17th century suggested the opposite. However, measurements by [[Maupertuis]] and the [[French Geodesic Mission]] in the 1730s established the [[figure of the Earth|oblateness of Earth]], thus confirming the positions of both Newton and [[Copernicus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Newton Wars and the Beginning of the French Enlightenment |first=J. B. |last=Shank |year=2008 |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |pages=324, 355 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BBusxgu8-AAC&amp;pg=PA234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Earth's rotating frame of reference, a freely moving body follows an apparent path that deviates from the one it would follow in a fixed frame of reference. Because of the [[Coriolis effect]], falling bodies veer slightly eastward from the vertical plumb line below their point of release, and projectiles veer right in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] (and left in the [[Southern Hemisphere|Southern]]) from the direction in which they are shot. The Coriolis effect is mainly observable at a meteorological scale, where it is responsible for the opposite directions of [[cyclone]] rotation in the Northern and Southern hemispheres (anticlockwise and [[clockwise]], respectively).

Hooke, following a suggestion from Newton in 1679, tried unsuccessfully to verify the predicted eastward deviation of a body dropped from a height of {{nowrap|8.2 meters}}, but definitive results were obtained later, in the late 18th and early 19th century, by [[Giovanni Battista Guglielmini]] in [[Bologna]], [[Johann Friedrich Benzenberg]] in [[Hamburg]] and [[Ferdinand Reich]] in [[Freiberg, Saxony|Freiberg]], using taller towers and carefully released weights.&lt;ref group=n&gt;See [[:de:Fallexperimente zum Nachweis der Erdrotation|Fallexperimente zum Nachweis der Erdrotation]] (German Wikipedia article).&lt;/ref&gt; A ball dropped from a height of {{convert|158.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} departed by {{convert|27.4|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} from the vertical compared with a calculated value of {{convert|28.1|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}}.

The most celebrated test of Earth's rotation is the [[Foucault pendulum]] first built by physicist [[Léon Foucault]] in 1851, which consisted of a lead-filled brass sphere suspended {{nowrap|67 m}} from the top of the [[Panthéon (Paris)|Panthéon]] in Paris. Because of the Earth's rotation under the swinging pendulum, the pendulum's plane of oscillation appears to rotate at a rate depending on latitude. At the latitude of Paris the predicted and observed shift was about {{nowrap|11 degrees}} [[clockwise]] per hour. Foucault pendulums now swing in [[List of Foucault pendulums|museums around the world]].

===True solar day===
{{Main article|Solar time}}
Earth's [[rotation period]] relative to the Sun ([[solar noon]] to solar noon) is its ''true solar day'' or ''apparent solar day''. It depends on the Earth's orbital motion and is thus affected by changes in the [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] and [[inclination]] of Earth's orbit. Both vary over thousands of years, so the annual variation of the true solar day also varies. Generally, it is longer than the mean solar day during two periods of the year and shorter during another two.{{refn|When Earth's eccentricity exceeds 0.047 and perihelion is at an appropriate equinox or solstice, only one period with one peak balances another period that has two peaks.&lt;ref name=Meeus/&gt;|group=n}} The true solar day tends to be longer near [[apsis|perihelion]] when the Sun apparently moves along the [[ecliptic]] through a greater angle than usual, taking about {{nowrap|10 seconds}} longer to do so. Conversely, it is about {{nowrap|10 seconds}} shorter near [[apsis|aphelion]]. It is about {{nowrap|20 seconds}} longer near a [[solstice]] when the projection of the Sun's apparent motion along the ecliptic onto the [[celestial equator]] causes the Sun to move through a greater angle than usual. Conversely, near an [[equinox]] the projection onto the equator is shorter by about {{nowrap|20 seconds}}. Currently, the perihelion and solstice effects combine to lengthen the true solar day near {{nowrap|22 December}} by {{nowrap|30 mean}} solar seconds, but the solstice effect is partially cancelled by the aphelion effect near {{nowrap|19 June}} when it is only {{nowrap|13 seconds}} longer. The effects of the equinoxes shorten it near {{nowrap|26 March}} and {{nowrap|16 September}} by {{nowrap|18 seconds}} and {{nowrap|21 seconds}}, respectively.&lt;ref name="Meeus"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jean Meeus|author2=J.

=== {{anchor|ephemeris}} Mean solar day===
{{main|Solar time#Mean solar time}}
The average of the true solar day during the course of an entire year is the ''mean solar day'', which contains {{nowrap|86,400 mean}} solar seconds. Currently, each of these seconds is slightly longer than an [[SI]] second because Earth's mean solar day is now slightly longer than it was during the 19th century due to [[tidal friction]]. The average length of the mean solar day since the introduction of the leap second in 1972 has been about 0 to 2 ms longer than 86,400 SI seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hpiers.obspm.fr/eoppc/eop/eopc04_05/eopc04.62-now|title= INTERNATIONAL EARTH ROTATION AND REFERENCE SYSTEMS SERVICE : EARTH ORIENTATION PARAMETERS : EOP (IERS) 05 C04|website=Hpiers.obspm.fr|accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/1538-3881/136/5/1906/pdf/1538-3881_136_5_1906.pdf |format=PDF|title=Physical basis of leap seconds|website=Iopscience.iop.org|accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/leapsec.html Leap seconds] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150312000000/http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/leapsec.html |date=12 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Random fluctuations due to core-mantle coupling have an amplitude of about 5 ms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ien.it/luc/cesio/itu/gambis.pdf|title=Prediction of Universal Time and LOD Variations|website=Ien.it|accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.

These tables were used to calculate the world's [[ephemeris|ephemerides]] between 1900 and 1983, so this second became known as the [[ephemeris second]]. In 1967 the SI second was made equal to the ephemeris second.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/leapsec.html Leap seconds by USNO] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150312000000/http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/leapsec.html |date=12 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Solar time#Apparent solar time|apparent solar time]] is a measure of the Earth's rotation and the difference between it and the mean solar time is known as the [[equation of time]].

At time 1, the Sun and a certain distant star are both overhead. At time 2, the planet has rotated 360° and the distant star is overhead again but the Sun is not (1→2 = one stellar day). It is not until a little later, at time 3, that the Sun is overhead again (1→3 = one solar day).]]
Earth's rotation period relative to the [[fixed star]]s, called its ''stellar day'' by the [[International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service]] (IERS), is {{nowrap|86,164.098 903 691}} seconds of mean solar time (UT1) {{nowrap|(23{{smallsup|h}} 56{{smallsup|m}} 4.098 903 691{{smallsup|s}}}}, {{nowrap|0.997 269 663 237 16}} mean solar days).&lt;ref name=IERS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hpiers.obspm.fr/eop-pc/models/constants.html|title=USEFUL CONSTANTS|website=Hpiers.obspm.fr|accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Aoki, the ultimate source of these figures, uses the term "seconds of UT1" instead of "seconds of mean solar time".&lt;ref&gt;Aoki, ''et al.'', "[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1982A&amp;A...105..359A The new definition of Universal Time]", ''Astronomy and Astrophysics'' '''105''' (1982) 359–361.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=n}} Earth's rotation period relative to the [[axial precession|precessing]] mean vernal [[equinox (celestial coordinates)|equinox]], named ''[[sidereal time|sidereal day]]'', is {{nowrap|86,164.090 530 832 88}} seconds of mean solar time (UT1) {{nowrap|(23{{smallsup|h}} 56{{smallsup|m}} 4.090 530 832 88{{smallsup|s}}}}, {{nowrap|0.997 269 566 329 08}} mean solar days).&lt;ref name=IERS/&gt; Thus, the sidereal day is shorter than the stellar day by about {{nowrap|8.4 ms}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac |editor=P.

The mean solar day in SI seconds is available from the IERS for the periods {{nowrap|1623–2005}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://hpiers.obspm.fr/eop-pc/earthor/ut1lod/lod-1623.html IERS Excess of the duration of the day to 86,400s … since 1623] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003083543/http://hpiers.obspm.fr/eop-pc/earthor/ut1lod/lod-1623.html |date=3 October 2008 }} Graph at end.&lt;/ref&gt; and {{nowrap|1962–2005}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813203913/http://hpiers.obspm.fr/eop-pc/earthor/ut1lod/figure3.html|title=Excess to 86400s of the duration day, 1995-1997|date=13 August 2007|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently (1999–2010) the average annual length of the mean solar day in excess of 86,400 SI seconds has varied between {{nowrap|0.25 ms}} and {{nowrap|1 ms}}, which must be added to both the stellar and sidereal days given in mean solar time above to obtain their lengths in SI seconds (see [[Fluctuations in the length of day]]).

===Angular speed===
[[File:Earth_rotation_tangential_speed.svg|thumb|Plot of latitude vs tangential speed. The dashed line shows the [[Kennedy Space Center]] example. The dot-dash line denotes typical airliner [[cruise speed]].]]

The angular speed of Earth's rotation in inertial space is {{nowrap|(7.2921150 ± 0.0000001){{E|−5}}}} [[radian]]s per SI second (mean solar second).&lt;ref name=IERS/&gt; Multiplying by (180°/π radians) × (86,400 seconds/mean solar day) yields 360.9856°/mean solar day, indicating that Earth rotates more than 360° relative to the fixed stars in one solar day. Earth's movement along its nearly circular orbit while it is rotating once around its axis requires that Earth rotate slightly more than once relative to the fixed stars before the mean Sun can pass overhead again, even though it rotates only once (360°) relative to the mean Sun.&lt;ref group=n&gt;In astronomy, unlike geometry, 360° means returning to the same point in some cyclical time scale, either one mean solar day or one sidereal day for rotation on Earth's axis, or one sidereal year or one mean tropical year or even one mean [[Julian year (astronomy)|Julian year]] containing exactly {{nowrap|365.25 days}} for revolution around the Sun.&lt;/ref&gt; Multiplying the value in rad/s by Earth's equatorial radius of {{nowrap|6,378,137 m}} ([[WGS84]] ellipsoid) (factors of 2π radians needed by both cancel) yields an '''equatorial speed of {{cvt|465.1|m/s|ft/s}}''', or {{cvt|1,674.4|km/h|mi/h}}.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur N. Cox, ed., ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=w8PK2XFLLH8C&amp;pg=PA244 Allen's Astrophysical Quantities]'' p.244.&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources state that Earth's equatorial speed is slightly less, or {{nowrap|1,669.8 km/h}}.&lt;ref&gt;Michael E. Bakich, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=PE99nOKjbXAC&amp;pg=PA50 The Cambridge planetary handbook]'', p.50.&lt;/ref&gt; This is obtained by dividing Earth's equatorial circumference by {{nowrap|24 hours}}. However, the use of only one circumference unwittingly implies only one rotation in inertial space, so the corresponding time unit must be a sidereal hour. This is confirmed by multiplying by the number of sidereal days in one mean solar day, {{nowrap|1.002 737 909 350 795}},&lt;ref name=IERS/&gt; which yields the equatorial speed in mean solar hours given above of {{nowrap|1,674.4 km/h}}.

The tangential speed of Earth's rotation at a point on Earth can be approximated by multiplying the speed at the equator by the cosine of the latitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Butterworth|author2=Palmer|last-author-amp=yes|title=Speed of the turning of the Earth|url=http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/ask_astro/answers/970401c.html|work=Ask an Astrophysicist|publisher=NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Kennedy Space Center]] is located at latitude 28.59° N, which yields a speed of: cos 28.59&amp;deg; &amp;times; {{convert|1674.4|km/h|mph m/s|abbr=on}} = {{convert|1470.23|km/h|mph m/s|abbr=on}}

[[File:AxialTiltObliquity.png|thumb|Earth's [[axial tilt]] is about 23.4°. It oscillates between 22.1° and 24.5° on a 41,000-year cycle and is currently decreasing.]]

=== In rotational axis ===
The Earth's rotation axis moves with respect to the fixed stars ([[inertial space]]); the components of this motion are [[precession]] and [[nutation]]. It also moves with respect to the Earth's crust; this is called [[polar motion]].

Precession is a rotation of the Earth's rotation axis, caused primarily by external torques from the gravity of the [[Sun]], Moon and other bodies. The polar motion is primarily due to [[Nutation|free core nutation]] and the [[Chandler wobble]].

=== In rotational velocity ===

==== Tidal interactions ====
Over millions of years, the Earth's rotation slowed significantly by [[tidal acceleration]] through gravitational interactions with the Moon. In this process, [[angular momentum]] is slowly transferred to the Moon at a rate proportional to &lt;math&gt;r^{-6}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the orbital radius of the Moon. This process gradually increased the length of day to its current value and resulted in the Moon being [[Tidal locking|tidally locked]] with the Earth.

This gradual rotational deceleration is empirically documented with estimates of day lengths obtained from observations of [[tidal rhythmites]] and [[stromatolite]]s; a compilation of these measurements&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=George E.|date=1 February 2000|title=Geological constraints on the Precambrian history of Earth's rotation and the Moon's orbit|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/1999RG900016/abstract|journal=Reviews of Geophysics|language=en|volume=38|issue=1|pages=37–59|doi=10.1029/1999RG900016|issn=1944-9208|bibcode=2000RvGeo..38...37W}}&lt;/ref&gt; found the length of day to increase steadily from about 21 hours at 600Myr ago&lt;ref name=Zahnle/&gt; to the current 24 hour value. By counting the microscopic lamina that form at higher tides, tidal frequencies (and thus day lengths) can be estimated, much like counting tree rings, though these estimates can be increasingly unreliable at older ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-67097-8_12|title=Periodic Growth Features in Fossil Organisms and the Length of the Day and Month|last=Scrutton|first=C.

==== Resonant stabilization ====

[[File:Simulated evolution of Earth's day length over time.png|thumb|A simulated history of Earth's day length, depicting a resonant-stabilizing event throughout the Precambrian era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bartlett|first=Benjamin C.|last2=Stevenson|first2=David J.|date=1 January 2016|title=Analysis of a Precambrian resonance-stabilized day length|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GL068912/abstract|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|language=en|pages=2016GL068912|doi=10.1002/2016GL068912|issn=1944-8007|arxiv=1502.01421|bibcode=2016GeoRL..43.5716B}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The current rate of tidal deceleration is anomalously high, implying the Earth's rotational velocity must have decreased more slowly in the past. Empirical data&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; tentatively shows a sharp increase in rotational deceleration about 600Myr ago. Some models suggest that the Earth maintained a constant day length of 21 hours throughout much of the [[Precambrian]].&lt;ref name=Zahnle&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zahnle|first=K.|last2=Walker|first2=J. C.|date=1 January 1987|title=A constant daylength during the Precambrian era?|journal=Precambrian Research|volume=37|pages=95–105|issn=0301-9268|pmid=11542096|doi=10.1016/0301-9268(87)90073-8|bibcode=1987PreR...37...95Z}}&lt;/ref&gt; This day length corresponds to the semidiurnal [[Resonance frequency|resonant period]] of the thermally-driven [[atmospheric tide]]; at this day length, the decelerative lunar torque could have been canceled by an accelerative torque from the atmospheric tide, resulting in no net torque and a constant rotational period. This stabilizing effect could have been broken by a sudden change in global temperature. Recent computational simulations support this hypothesis and suggest the [[Marinoan glaciation|Marinoan]] or [[Sturtian glaciation]]s broke this stable configuration about 600Myr ago, citing the resemblance of simulated results and existing paleorotational data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bartlett|first=Benjamin C.|last2=Stevenson|first2=David J.|date=1 January 2016|title=Analysis of a Precambrian resonance-stabilized day length|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GL068912/abstract|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|language=en|pages=2016GL068912|doi=10.1002/2016GL068912|issn=1944-8007|arxiv=1502.01421|bibcode=2016GeoRL..43.5716B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Global events ====

[[File:Deviation of day length from SI day.svg|thumb|Deviation of day length from SI based day]]

Additionally, some large-scale events, such as the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]], have caused the length of a day to shorten by 3 microseconds by affecting the Earth's moment of inertia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/news/2004/041229/full/news041229-6.html Sumatran earthquake sped up Earth's rotation], Nature, 30 December 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Post-glacial rebound]], ongoing since the last [[Ice age]], is also changing the distribution of the Earth's mass thus affecting the [[moment of inertia]] of the Earth and, by the [[conservation of angular momentum]], the Earth's rotation period.&lt;ref name="wu-peltier-1984"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wu |first=P. |author2=W.R.Peltier |year=1984 |title=Pleistocene deglaciation and the earth's rotation: a new analysis |journal=Geophysical Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=76 |pages=753–792 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-246X.1984.tb01920.x |issue=3|bibcode = 1984GeoJ...76..753W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Measurement===
The primary monitoring of the Earth's rotation is performed with [[very-long-baseline interferometry]] coordinated with the [[Global Positioning System]], [[satellite laser ranging]], and other [[satellite]] techniques. This provides an absolute [[reference]] for the determination of [[universal time]], precession, and nutation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hpiers.obspm.fr/eop-pc/techniques/techniques.html|title=Permanent monitoring|website=Hpiers.obspm.fr|accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient observations===
There are recorded observations of [[solar eclipse|solar]] and [[lunar eclipse]]s by [[Babylonian astronomy|Babylonian]] and [[Chinese astronomy|Chinese astronomers]] beginning in the 8th century BCE, as well as from [[astronomy in the medieval Islamic world|the medieval Islamic world]] and elsewhere. These observations can be used to determine changes in the Earth's rotation over the last 27 centuries, since the length of the day is a critical parameter in the calculation of the place and time of eclipses. A change in day length of milliseconds per century shows up as a change of hours and thousands of kilometers in eclipse observations. The ancient data are consistent with a shorter day, meaning the Earth was turning faster throughout the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sid Perkins|date=6 December 2016|title=Ancient eclipses show Earth’s rotation is slowing|journal=Science|doi=10.1126/science.aa10469|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/12/ancient-eclipses-show-earth-s-rotation-slowing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=FR Stephenson |author2=LV Morrison |author3=CY Hohonkerk |title= Measurement of the Earth’s rotation: 720 BC to AD 2015 |journal= Proceedings of the Royal Society A |date=7 December 2016 |doi= 10.1098/rspa.2016.0404 |volume= 472 |issue= 2196 |url= http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/472/2196/20160404 |bibcode=2016RSPSA.47260404S |pmc=5247521 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
[[File:Protoplanetary-disk.jpg|right|thumb|An artist's rendering of the [[protoplanetary disk]].]]
The Earth's original rotation was a vestige of the original [[angular momentum]] of the cloud of [[dust]], [[Rock (geology)|rocks]], and [[gas]] that coalesced to form the [[Solar System]]. This primordial cloud was composed of [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] produced in the [[Big Bang]], as well as heavier [[chemical element|elements]] ejected by [[supernova]]s. As this [[interstellar dust]] is heterogeneous, any asymmetry during gravitational accretion resulted in the angular momentum of the eventual planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/56-our-solar-system/planets-and-dwarf-planets/general-questions/218-why-do-planets-rotate-intermediate| title = Why do planets rotate?| work = Ask an Astronomer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, if the [[giant-impact hypothesis]] for the origin of the Moon is correct, this primordial rotation rate would have been reset by the [[Theia (planet)|Theia]] impact 4.5 billion years ago. Regardless of the speed and tilt of the Earth's rotation before the impact, it would have experienced a day some five hours long after the impact.&lt;ref name=areps15&gt;{{cite journal | last=Stevenson | first=D. J. | title=Origin of the moon–The collision hypothesis | journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences | date=1987 | volume=15 | issue=1 | pages=271–315 | bibcode=1987AREPS..15..271S | doi=10.1146/annurev.ea.15.050187.001415 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tidal effects would then have slowed this rate to its modern value.

'''Ecosystem health''' is a metaphor used to describe the condition of an [[ecosystem]].&lt;ref name=rapport1998&gt;Rapport, David (1998). "Defining ecosystem health." Pages 18-33 in Rapport, D.J. (ed.) (1998). ''Ecosystem Health.'' Blackwell Scientific.&lt;/ref&gt; Ecosystem condition can vary as a result of fire, [[flooding]], [[drought]], [[extinction]]s, [[invasive species]], [[climate change]], [[mining]], [[overexploitation]] in [[fishing]], [[farming]] or [[logging]], [[chemical spill]]s, and a host of other reasons. There is no universally accepted benchmark for a healthy ecosystem,&lt;ref&gt;Rapport, David J. (1992). "Evaluating ecosystem health." ''Journal of aquatic ecosystem health'' 1:15-24&lt;/ref&gt; rather the apparent health status of an ecosystem can vary depending upon which health metrics are employed in judging it&lt;ref name=palmer2012&gt;Palmer, Margaret A. and Catherine M. Febria (2012). "The heartbeat of ecosystems." ''Science'' 336:1393-1394.&lt;/ref&gt; and which societal aspirations are driving the assessment. Advocates of the health metaphor argue for its simplicity as a communication tool. "Policy-makers and the public need simple, understandable concepts like health."&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, Judy L. (1997). "Stream health: incorporating the human dimension to advance stream ecology." ''Journal of the North American Benthological Society'' 16:439^447&lt;/ref&gt; Critics worry that ecosystem health, a "value-laden construct", is often "passed off as science to unsuspecting policy makers and the public."&lt;ref&gt;Lackey, Robert T. (2007). "Science, scientists, and policy advocacy." ''Conservation Biology.'' 21(1): 12-17.&lt;/ref&gt;
== History of the concept ==

The health metaphor applied to the environment has been in use at least since the early 1800s&lt;ref&gt;Anon (1816). "Rural economy, agricultur
" ''[[Encyclopaedia Perthensis]]'' Volume 19, 391-497. Edinburgh: John Brown.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anon (1839). "On the culture of potatoes". ''Framer's Magazine, '' 2(5):337-338.&lt;/ref&gt; and the great American conservationist [[Aldo Leopold]] (1887–1948) spoke metaphorically of land health, land sickness, mutilation, and violence when describing land use practices.&lt;ref&gt;Leopold, Aldo (1946). "The land health concept and conservation." Pages 218-226 in Callicott, J. Baird, and Eric T.Freyfogle. (1999) ''For the Health of the Land. '' Washington DC: Island Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "ecosystem management" has been in use at least since the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Lutz, H.J. (1957). "Applications of ecology in forest management." ''Ecology'' 38:46-64.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "ecosystem health" has become widespread in the ecological literature, as a general metaphor meaning something good,&lt;ref name=Jax2010&gt;Jax, Kurt. (2010). ''Ecosystem Functioning.'' Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; and as an environmental quality goal in field assessments of rivers,&lt;ref&gt;Davies, P.E. et al. (2010). "The Sustainable Rivers Audit: assessing river ecosystem health in the Murray–Darling Basin, Australia." ''Marine and Freshwater Research'' 61:764–777.&lt;/ref&gt; lakes,&lt;ref&gt;Xu, F, ZF Yang, B. Chen, and Y.W. Zhao. (2012). "Ecosystem Health Assessment of Baiyangdian Lake Based on Thermodynamic Indicators."

''Journal of Forestry'' 95:23-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently however this metaphor has been subject of quantitative formulation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ramírez-Carrillo|first=Elvia|last2=López-Corona|first2=Oliver|last3=Toledo-Roy|first3=Juan C.|last4=Lovett|first4=Jon C.|last5=León-González|first5=Fernando de|last6=Osorio-Olvera|first6=Luis|last7=Equihua|first7=Julian|last8=Robredo|first8=Everardo|last9=Frank|first9=Alejandro|date=2018-07-16|title=Assessing sustainability in North America’s ecosystems using criticality and information theory|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0200382|journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=13|issue=7|pages=e0200382|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0200382|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt; using complex systems concepts such as criticality, meaning that a healthy ecosystem is in some sort of balance between adaptability (randomness) and robustness (order) . Nevertheless the universality of criticality is still under examination and is known as the Criticality Hypothesis, which states that systems in a dynamic regime shifting between order and disorder, attain the highest level of computational capabilities and achieve an optimal trade-off between robustness and flexibility. Recent results in cell and evolutionary biology, neuroscience and computer science have great interest in the criticality hypothesis, emphasizing its role as a viable candidate general law in the realm of adaptive complex systems (see &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roli|first=Andrea|last2=Villani|first2=Marco|last3=Filisetti|first3=Alessandro|last4=Serra|first4=Roberto|date=2017-11-17|title=Dynamical Criticality: Overview and Open Questions|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11424-017-6117-5|journal=Journal of Systems Science and Complexity|volume=31|issue=3|pages=647–663|doi=10.1007/s11424-017-6117-5|issn=1009-6124}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and references therein).

== Meaning ==

The term ecosystem health has been employed to embrace some suite of environmental goals deemed desirable.&lt;ref&gt;Slocombe, D. Scott (1998). "Defining Goals and Criteria for Ecosystem-Based Management." ''Environmental Management'' 22:483–493&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Grumbine's highly cited paper&lt;ref name=grumbine1994&gt;Grumbine, R. Edward (1994). "What is ecosystem management?" ''Conservation Biology'' 8:27-38&lt;/ref&gt; "What is ecosystem management?" surveyed ecosystem management and ecosystem health literature and summarized frequently encountered goal statements:
* Conserving [[viable population]]s of [[native species]]
* Conserving [[ecosystem diversity]]
* Maintaining evolutionary and ecological processes
* Managing over long time frames to maintain evolutionary potential
* Accommodating human use and occupancy within these constraints

Grumbine describes each of these goals as a "value statement" and stresses the role of human [[values]] in setting ecosystem management goals.

It is the last goal mentioned in the survey, accommodating humans, that is most contentious. "We have observed that when groups of stakeholders work to define … visions, this leads to debate over whether to emphasize ecosystem health or human well-being … Whether the priority is ecosystems or people greatly influences stakeholders' assessment of desirable ecological and social states."&lt;ref&gt;Leslie, heather M. and Karen L. McLeod (2007). "Confronting the challenges of implementing marine ecosystem-based management." ''Frontiers of Ecology and the Environment'' 5:540-548.&lt;/ref&gt; and, for example, "For some, [[wolves]] are critical to ecosystem health and an essential part of nature, for others they are a symbol of government overreach threatening their livelihoods and cultural values."&lt;ref&gt;Myers, Andrew (2015). Which wolf, which trap? Socially constructing wolves and trapping in western Montana. ''Scholar Works'', University of Montana, Oral Presentations.&lt;/ref&gt;

Measuring ecosystem health requires extensive goal-driven environmental sampling. For example, a vision for ecosystem health of [[Lake Superior]] was developed by a public forum and a series of objectives were prepared for [[habitat protection|protection of habitat]] and maintenance of populations of some 70 indigenous fish species.&lt;ref name=horns2003&gt;Horns, W.H., et al. (2003). '' Fish-community objectives for Lake Superior. '' Great Lakes Fish. Commission Special Publication. 03-01. 78 pages.&lt;/ref&gt; A suite of 80 lake health indicators was developed for the Great Lakes Basin including monitoring native fish species, exotic species, water levels, phosphorus levels, toxic chemicals, [[phytoplankton]], [[zooplankton]], fish tissue contaminants, etc.&lt;ref name=Shear2003&gt;Shear, Harvey et al. (2003). "The development and implementation of indicators of ecosystem health in the Great Lakes Basin." ''Journal of Environmental Monitoring and Assessment'' 88:119–152&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors have attempted broad definitions of ecosystem health, such as benchmarking as healthy the historical ecosystem state "prior to the onset of [[anthropocene|anthropogenic stress]]."&lt;ref name=rapport2011&gt;Rapport, David J. and • Luisa Maffi  (2011). "Eco-cultural health, global health, and sustainability." ''Ecological Research'' 26:1039-1049&lt;/ref&gt; A difficulty is that the historical composition of many human-altered ecosystems is unknown or unknowable. Also, [[fossil record|fossil]] and [[pollen]] records indicate that the species that occupy an ecosystem [[ecologic succession|reshuffle]] through time, so it is difficult to identify one snapshot in time as optimum or "healthy.".&lt;ref name=wicklum1995&gt;Wicklum, D. and Ronald W. Davies (1995). "Ecosystem health and integrity?" ''Canadian Journal of Botany'' 73:997-1000.&lt;/ref&gt;

A commonly cited broad definition states that a healthy ecosystem has three attributes:
# [[Productivity (ecology)|productivity]],
# [[resilience (ecology)|resilience]], and
# "organization" (including [[biodiversity]]).&lt;ref name=rapport2011 /&gt;

While this captures significant ecosystem properties, a generalization is elusive as those properties do not necessarily co-vary in nature. For example, there is not necessarily a clear or consistent relationship between productivity and species richness.&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Peter et al. (2011). "Productivity is a poor predictor of plant species richness." ''Science'' 333:1750-1752.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the relationship between  [[System resilience|resilience]] and diversity is complex, and [[ecosystem stability]] may depend upon one or a few species rather than overall diversity.&lt;ref&gt;Ives, Anthony R. and Stephen R. Carpenter (2007). "Stability and Diversity of Ecosystems." ''Science'' 317:58-62.&lt;/ref&gt; And some undesirable ecosystems are highly productive.&lt;ref&gt;Asanova, Umut (2002). "Philosophy of ecological ethics education, considering the Issyk-Kul Lake reediation mechanisms." Jean Klerkx and Beishen Imanakanov (2002). Lake Issk-Kul: Its natural Environment Springer Science&lt;/ref&gt;

"Resilience is not desirable per se. There can be highly resilient states of ecosystems which are very undesirable from some human perspectives , such as algal-dominated [[coral reef]]s."&lt;ref name=Jax2010 /&gt; Ecological [[resilience (ecology)|resilience]] is a "capacity" that varies depending upon which properties of the ecosystem are to be studied and depending upon what kinds of disturbances are considered and how they are to be quantified.  Approaches to assessing it "face high uncertainties and still require a considerable amount of empirical and theoretical research."&lt;ref name=Jax2010 /&gt;

Other authors have sought a numerical index of ecosystem health that would permit quantitative comparisons among ecosystems and within ecosystems over time.  One such system employs ratings of the three properties mentioned above: Health = system vigor x system organization x [[system resilience]].&lt;ref&gt;Costanza, R. 1992. "Toward an operational definition of ecosystem health." Pp 239-256 in Costanza, R., B. Norton, and B. Haskell. ''Ecosystem health. New Goals for Environmental Management. '' Washington DC: Island Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Ecologist Glenn Suter argues that such indices employ "nonsense units," the indices have "no meaning; they cannot be predicted, so they are not applicable to most regulatory problems; they have no diagnostic power; effects of one component are eclipsed by responses of other components, and the reason for a high or low index value is unknown."&lt;ref name=suter1993&gt;Suter, Glenn W. (1993). "A critique of ecosystem health concepts and indexes." ''Environmental toxicology and chemistry'' 12:1533-1539.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health indicators ==

Health [[Performance metric|metrics]] are determined by stakeholder goals, which drive ecosystem definition. An ecosystem is an abstraction.&lt;ref&gt;Jax, Kurt (2007). "Can we define ecosystems? On the confusion between definition and description of ecological concepts." ''Acta Biotheor'' 55:341–355&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Oneill2001&gt;O'Neill, Robert V. (2001). "Is it time to bury the ecosystem concept? (with full military honors, of course!)" ''Ecology'' 82:3275–3284&lt;/ref&gt;  "Ecosystems cannot be identified or found in nature. Instead, they must be delimited by an observer. This can be done in many different ways for the same chunk of nature, depending on the specific perspectives of interest."&lt;ref name=Jax2010 /&gt;

Ecosystem definition determines the acceptable range of variability (reference conditions) and determines measurement variables. The latter are used as indicators of ecosystem structure and function, and can be used as indicators of "health".

An [[Environmental indicator|indicator]] is a variable, such as a chemical or biological property, that when measured, is used to infer trends in another (unmeasured) environmental variable or cluster of unmeasured variables (the indicandum). For example, rising [[mortality rate]] of canaries in a coal mine is an indicator of rising [[carbon monoxide]] levels. Rising [[chlorophyll-a]] levels in a lake may signal [[eutrophication]].&lt;ref&gt;Wright, David A. and Pamela Welbourne (2002) ''Environmental Toxicology''. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ecosystem assessments employ two kinds of indicators, descriptive indicators and normative indicators. "Indicators can be used descriptively for a scientific purpose or normatively for a political purpose."&lt;ref name=heink2010&gt;Heink, Ulrich and Ingo Kowarik (2010) "What are indicators? On the definition of indicators in ecology and environmental planning." ''Ecological Indicators'' 10:584–593&lt;/ref&gt;

Used descriptively, high chlorophyll-a is an indicator of eutrophication, but it may also be used as an ecosystem health indicator. When used as a normative (health) indicator, it indicates a rank on a health scale, a rank that can vary widely depending on societal preferences as to what is desirable. A high chlorophyll-a level in a natural [[ecological succession|successional]] [[wetland]] might be viewed as healthy whereas a human-impacted wetland with the ''same'' indicator value may be judged unhealthy.&lt;ref&gt;Costanza,  Robert, and Michael Mageau (1999). "What is a healthy ecosystem?" ''Aquatic Ecology'' 33: 105–115&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimation of ecosystem health has been criticized for intermingling the two types of environmental indicators.&lt;ref name=heink2010 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carolan, Michael (2006). "The values and vulnerabilities of metaphors within the environmental sciences." ''Society and Natural Resources'' 19:921–930&lt;/ref&gt; A health indicator is a normative indicator, and if conflated with descriptive indicators "implies that normative values can be measured objectively, which is certainly not true. Thus, implicit values are insinuated to the reader, a situation which has to be avoided."&lt;ref name=heink2010 /&gt;

It can be argued that the very act of selecting indicators of any kind is [[bias]]ed by the observer's perspective&lt;ref&gt;Jax, Kurt (2005). "Function and 'functioning' in ecology: what does it mean?" ''Oikos'' 111:3&lt;/ref&gt; but separation of goals from descriptions has been advocated as a step toward transparency:  "A separation of descriptive and normative indicators is essential from the perspective of the philosophy of science … Goals and values cannot be deduced directly from descriptions … a fact that is emphasized repeatedly in the literature of environmental ethics … Hence, we advise always specifying the definition of indicators and propose clearly distinguishing ecological indicators in science from policy indicators used for decision-making processes."&lt;ref name=heink2010 /&gt;

And integration of multiple, possibly conflicting, normative indicators into a single measure of "ecosystem health" is problematic. Using 56 indicators, "determining environmental status and assessing [[marine ecosystem]]s health in an integrative way is still one of the grand challenges in marine ecosystems ecology, research and management"&lt;ref&gt;Borja A, et al. (2014). "Tales from a thousand and one ways to integrate marine ecosystem components when assessing the environmental status." ''Frontiers in Marine Science''. 1:72&lt;/ref&gt;

Another issue with indicators is validity. Good indicators must have an independently validated high [[Predictive value of tests|predictive value]], that is high [[sensitivity (control systems)|sensitivity]] (high probability of indicating a significant change in the indicandum) and high [[specificity (statistics)|specificity]] (low probability of wrongly indicating a change). The reliability of various health metrics has been questioned&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, Guy, et al. (2012). Continental-wide effects of nutrient pollution on stream ecosystem functioning. ''Science'', 336:1448-1440.&lt;/ref&gt; and "what combination of measurements should be used to evaluate ecosystems is a matter of current scientific debate."&lt;ref name=palmer2012&gt;Palmer, Margaret A. and Catherine M. Febria (2012). "The heartbeat of ecosystems." ''Science'' 336:1393-1394.&lt;/ref&gt; Most attempts to identify ecological indicators have been [[correlation|correlative]] rather than derived from prospective testing of their predictive value&lt;ref&gt;Barton, Philip S. et al. (2015). "Learning from clinical medicine to improve the use of surrogates in ecology." ''Oikos'' 124:391-398.&lt;/ref&gt; and the selection process for many indicators has been based upon weak evidence or has been lacking in evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed A.H. et al. (2016). "How do ecologists select and use indicator species to monitor ecological change? Insights from 14 years of publication in ''Ecological Indicators''." ''Ecological Indicator''s 60:223-230.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases no reliable indicators are known: "We found no examples of [[invertebrates]] successfully used in [forest] monitoring programs. Their richness and abundance ensure that they play significant roles in ecosystem function but thwart focus on a few key species." And, "Reviews of species-based monitoring approaches reveal that no single species, nor even a group of species, accurately reflects entire communities. Understanding the response of a single species may not provide reliable predictions about a group of species even when the group is {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} a few very similar species."&lt;ref&gt;Kremsater, Laurie L. and Fred L. Bunnell (2009). "Sustaining forest-dwelling species." Pages 173-218 in Bunnell, Fred L. and Glen B. Dunsworth (2009). ''Forestry and Biodiversity''. Learning how to Sustain Biodiversity in Managed Forests. UBC Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship to human health: the health paradox ==

A trade-off between human health and the "health" of nature has been termed the "health paradox"&lt;ref&gt;C. Max Finlayson and Pierre Horwitz (2015). "Wetlands as settings for human health – the benefits and the paradox."  Pages 1-13 in Finlayson, C.M. et al. 2015. ''Wetlands and Human Health''. Springer&lt;/ref&gt; and it illuminates how human values drive perceptions of ecosystem health.

Human health has benefited by sacrificing the "health" of wild ecosystems, such as dismantling and [[dam]]ming of wild valleys, destruction of [[mosquito]]-bearing [[wetlands]], diversion of water for [[irrigation]], conversion of wilderness to [[farmland]], [[timber]] removal, and [[Local extinction|extirpation]] of [[tiger]]s, whales, ferrets, and [[wolves]].

There has been an acrimonious schism among [[conservation movement|conservationists]] and resource managers&lt;ref&gt;Tallis, Heather and  &amp; Jane Lubchenco  (2014) "Working together: A call for inclusive conservation." ''Nature'' 515, 27–28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tudela, Sergi and Katherine Short (2005). "Paradigm shifts, gaps, inertia, and political agendas in ecosystem-based fisheries management." ''Marine Ecology Progress Series'' 300:282-286.&lt;/ref&gt; over the question of whether to "ratchet back human domination of the biosphere" or whether to embrace it.&lt;ref&gt;Noss, Redd et al. (2013). "Humanity's domination of nature is part of the problem: a response to Kareiva and Marvier." ''BioScience'' 63:241-242&lt;/ref&gt; These two perspectives have been characterized as utilitarian vs protectionist.&lt;ref&gt;Nijhius, Michelle (2014). "Bridging the conservation divide."  New Yorker, December 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[utilitarian]] view treats [[human health]] and [[well-being]] as criteria of ecosystem health.&lt;ref&gt;Su, Meirong et al. (2010)."Urban ecosystem health assessment: A review." ''Science of the Total Environment'' 408:2425–2434&lt;/ref&gt; For example, destruction of wetlands to control malaria mosquitoes "resulted in an improvement in ecosystem health."&lt;ref&gt;Rapport, David J. (1998). "Some distinctions worth making." ''Ecosystem Health'' 4:193-194.&lt;/ref&gt;
The protectionist view treats humans as an invasive species: "If there was ever a species that qualified as an invasive pest, it is ''Homo sapiens'',"&lt;ref name=Oneill2001 /&gt;

Proponents of the utilitarian view argue that "healthy ecosystems are characterized by their capability to sustain healthy human populations,"&lt;ref name=rapport1998 /&gt; and "healthy ecosystems must be economically viable," as it is "unhealthy" ecosystems that are likely to result in increases in [[contamination]], [[infectious disease]]s, fires, floods, [[crop failure]]s and fishery collapse.&lt;ref&gt;Rapport, David (1998). "Dimensions of ecosystem health." Pages 34-40 in Rapport, D.J. (ed.) (1998). ''Ecosystem Health''. Blackwell Scientific.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Protectionist]]s argue that privileging of human health is a [[conflict of interest]] as humans have [[ecosystem destruction|demolished]] massive numbers of ecosystems to maintain their welfare, also disease and [[parasitism]] are historically normal in pre-industrial nature.&lt;ref name=wilkins1999&gt;Wilkins, D.A. (1999). "Assessing ecosystem health."  ''Trends in Ecology and Evolution'' 14:70&lt;/ref&gt; Diseases and parasites promote ecosystem functioning, driving biodiversity and productivity,&lt;ref&gt;Hudson, Peter J., Andrew P. Dobson and Kevin D. Lafferty (2006). "Is a healthy ecosystem one that is rich in parasites?" ''Trends in Ecology and Evolution'' 21:381-385.&lt;/ref&gt; and parasites may constitute a significant fraction of ecosystem biomass.&lt;ref&gt;Kuris, Armand M. et al. (2008). "Ecosystem energetic implications of parasite and free-living biomass in three estuaries." ''Nature'' 454:515-518.&lt;/ref&gt;

The very choice of the word "health" applied to ecology has been questioned as lacking in neutrality in a BioScience article on responsible use of scientific language: "Some conservationists fear that these terms could endorse human domination of the planet … and could exacerbate the shifting cognitive baseline whereby humans tend to become accustomed to new and often degraded ecosystems and thus forget the nature of the past."&lt;ref&gt;Kueffer, Christoph and Brendon M. H. Larson (2014). "Responsible Use of Language in Scientific Writing and Science Communication." ''BioScience'' 64(8): 719–724.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism of the concept and proposed alternatives ==

Criticism of ecosystem health largely targets the failure of proponents to explicitly distinguish the normative dimension from the descriptive dimension, and has included the following:
* Ecosystem health is in the eye of the beholder. It is an economic, political or ethical judgement rather than a scientific measure of environmental quality. Health ratings are shaped by the goals and preferences of environmental stakeholders.&lt;ref name=lancaster2000&gt;Lancaster, Jill (2000). "The Ridiculous Notion of Assessing Ecological Health and Identifying the Useful Concepts Underneath."''Human and Ecological Risk Assessment'' 6: 213-222&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carolan, Michael S. (2006). "Science, Expertise, and the Democratization of the Decision-Making Process." ''Society and Natural Resources'' 19:661–668&lt;/ref&gt; "At the core of debates over the utility of ecosystem health is a struggle over which societal preferences will take precedence."&lt;ref name=lackey2003&gt;Lackey, Robert T. (2003). "Appropriate use of ecosystem health and normative science in ecological policy" Pages. 175-186 in: Rapport, David J. et al. (2003)  ''Managing for Healthy Ecosystems ''  Boca Raton, Florida: Lewis Publishers, , 1510 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Health is a metaphor, not a property of an ecosystem. Health is an abstraction. It implies "good", an optimum condition, but in nature ecosystems are ever-changing transitory assemblages with no identifiable optimum.&lt;ref name=wicklum1995 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Calow, P. (1992)." Can ecosystems be healthy? Critical consideration of concepts." ''Journal of Aquatic Ecosystem Health'' 1:1-5.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Use of human health and well-being as a criterion of ecosystem health introduces an arrogance and a conflict of interest into environmental assessment, as human population growth has caused much [[environmental damage]].&lt;ref name=wilkins1999 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stanley, Thomas R. Jr. (1995). "Ecosystem management and the arrogance of humanism." ''Conservation Biology'' 9:255-262&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ecosystem health masquerades as an operational goal because environmental managers "may be reluctant to define their goals clearly."&lt;ref name=lackey2001 /&gt;
* It is a vague concept.&lt;ref name=Jax2010 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duarte, Carlos M. et al. (2015). "Paradigms in the recovery of estuarine and coastal ecosystems." ''Estuaries and Coasts'' 38:1202-1212&lt;/ref&gt; "Currently there are many, often contradictory, definitions of ecosystem health,"&lt;ref name=lackey2001&gt;Lackey, Robert T. (2001). "Values, Policy, and Ecosystem Health." ''BioScience'' 51(6):437-443&lt;/ref&gt; that "are open to so much abuse and misuse that they represent a threat to the environment."&lt;ref name=lancaster2000 /&gt;
* "There are in general no clear definitions of what proponents of the concept mean by 'ecosystem'."&lt;ref name=Jax2010 /&gt;
* The public can be deceived by the term ecosystem health which may camouflage the ramifications of a policy goal and be employed to pejoratively rank policy choices.&lt;ref name=lackey2001 /&gt; "The most pervasive misuse of ecosystem health and similar normative notions is insertion of personal values under the guise of 'scientific' impartiality."&lt;ref name=lackey2003 /&gt;

Alternatives have been proposed for the term ecosystem health, including more neutral language such as ecosystem status,&lt;ref&gt;Link, Jason S. (2002) "What Does Ecosystem-Based Fisheries Management Mean?" ''Fisheries'' 27:18-21&lt;/ref&gt; ecosystem prognosis, and ecosystem sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;Schrecker, Ted (1995) Synthesis of Discussion.pp 118-125 in  Hodge, Tony et al. ''Pathways to Sustainability: Assessing Our Progress''. Ottawa: National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy.&lt;/ref&gt; Another alternative to the use of a health metaphor is  to "express exactly and clearly the public policy and the management objective", to employ habitat descriptors and real properties of ecosystems.&lt;ref name=suter1993 /&gt;&lt;ref name=lancaster2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name=lackey2001 /&gt; An example of a policy statement is "The maintenance of viable natural populations of wildlife and ecological functions always takes precedence over any human use of wildlife."&lt;ref&gt;Anon (1995). ''Wildlife policy for Prince Edward Island. Government of Prince Edward Island'', 18 pages.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a goal is "Maintain viable populations of all native species in situ."&lt;ref name=grumbine1994 /&gt; An example of a management objective is "Maintain self-sustaining populations of lake whitefish within the range of abundance observed during 1990-99."&lt;ref name=horns2003 /&gt;

Kurt Jax&lt;ref name=Jax2010 /&gt; presented an ecosystem assessment format that avoids imposing a preconceived notion of normality, that avoids the muddling of normative and descriptive, and that gives serious attention to ecosystem definition. (1) Societal purposes for the ecosystem are negotiated by stakeholders, (2) a functioning ecosystem is defined with emphasis on phenomena relevant to stakeholder goals, (3) benchmark reference conditions and permissible variation of the system are established, (4) measurement variables are chosen for use as indicators, and (5) the time scale and spatial scale of assessment are decided.

The '''Ekeby oak tree''' ({{lang-sv|Ekebyhovseken}}) is an oak tree in [[Ekerö]] outside [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], close to [[Ekebyhov Castle]].

The related process of [[symbiogenesis]] or endosymbiosis was proposed by [[Lynn Margulis]] in 1967. She argued that the internal symbiosis of bacteria-like organisms had formed organelles like [[chloroplast]]s and [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]]. She proposed that this had created the [[eukaryote]]s, and thus driven the expansion of life on Earth. She had argued that this process of symbiotic collaboration had run alongside the classical [[Darwinian]] cycle of [[mutation]], [[natural selection]] and [[adaptation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sagan, Lynn |year=1967 |title=On the origin of mitosing cells |journal=[[J Theor Biol]] |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=255–274 |pmid=11541392 |doi=10.1016/0022-5193(67)90079-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genetic symbiosis from parasites ==
Roberto Cazzolla Gatti, Ph.D., associate professor at [[Tomsk State University]] (Russia), argued in his hypothesis that "the main likely cause of the evolution of sexual reproduction, the [[parasitism]], also represents the origin of biodiversity". 
In other terms, this theory suggests that sexual reproduction acts as a conservative system against the inclusion of new genetic variations into cells' DNA (supported by the DNA repair systems) and, instead, the evolution of species can take place only when this preservative system fails to contrast the inclusion, within the host genome, of hexogen parts of DNA (and RNA) coming from obliged "parasitic" elements (viruses and phages) that establish a symbiosis with their hosts. 
"As two parallel evolutionary lines – Cazzolla Gatti wrote in his original paper – sexual reproduction seems to preserve what the endogenosymbiosis moves to diversify. Following the former process, the species can adapt slowly and indefinitely to the external factors, adjusting themselves, but not 'creating' novelty. The latter process, instead, leads to the speciation due to sudden changes in genes sequences. Not only organelles can be symbiotic with other cells, as suggested Lynn Margulis, but entire pieces of genetic material coming from symbiotic parasites, can be included in the host DNA, changing the gene expression and addressing the speciation process".

This idea challenges the canonical natural selection models based on the gradualism of the mutation-adaptation pattern, providing more support to the [[punctuated equilibrium theory]] proposed by [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Niles Eldredge]].

== Evidence ==
Two independent studies provide support for the hypothesis. Jamie E. Henzy and Welkin E. Johnson demonstrated that the complex evolutionary history of the IFIT (Interferon Induced proteins with Tetratricopeptide repeats) family of antiviral genes has been shaped by continuous interactions between [[mammal]]ian hosts and their many viruses.&lt;ref&gt;Henzy, J. E., &amp; Johnson, W. E. 2016. Phylogenetic sleuthing reveals pair of paralogous genes. eLife, 5, e17224&lt;/ref&gt;

David Enard and colleagues estimated that viruses have driven close to 30% of all adaptive [[amino acid]] changes in the part of the human proteome conserved within mammals. Their results suggest that viruses are one of the most dominant drivers of evolutionary change across mammalian and human proteomes.&lt;ref&gt;Enard, D., Cai, L., Gwennap, C., &amp; Petrov, D. A. 2016. Viruses are a dominant driver of protein adaptation in mammals. eLife, 5, e12469&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously, it was estimated that about 7–8% percent of the entire human genome carry about 100,000 pieces of DNA that came from endogenous [[retrovirus]]es. This may be an underestimate.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

In 2016 the biologists Sarah R. Bordestein and Seth R. Bordestein reported that genes are frequently transferred between hosts and parasites. Eukaryotic genes are often co-opted by viruses and bacterial genes are commonly found in [[bacteriophage]]s. The presence of bacteriophages in symbiotic bacteria that obligately reside in eukaryotes may promote eukayotic DNA transfers to bacteriophages.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah R. Bordenstein &amp; Seth R. Bordenstein, Eukaryotic association module in phage WO genomes from Wolbachia, Nature Communications 7, Article number: 13155 (2016) doi:10.1038/ncomms13155&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Evolution]] has been an important theme in fiction, including [[speculative evolution]] in [[science fiction]], since the late 19th century, though it began before [[Charles Darwin]]'s time, and reflects [[orthogenesis|progressionist]] and [[Lamarck]]ist views as well as Darwin's.&lt;ref name=SFE&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stableford |first1=Brian M. |last2=Langford |first2=David R. | |title=Evolution |url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/evolution |work=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction |publisher=Gollancz |accessdate=24 July 2018 |date=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Darwinian evolution]] is pervasive in literature, whether taken optimistically in terms of how humanity may evolve towards perfection, or pessimistically in terms of the dire consequences of the interaction of human nature and the struggle for survival. Other themes include the replacement of humanity, either by other species or by [[intelligent machine]]s.

==Context==

[[Charles Darwin]]'s [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]], as set out in his 1859 ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', is the dominant theory in modern biology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Why Evolution is True |last = Coyne |first=Jerry A. |authorlink=Jerry Coyne |year=2009 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=0-19-923084-6 |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Evolution Resources |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine]] |year=2016 |url=http://www.nas.edu/evolution/index.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603230514/http://www.nas.edu/evolution/index.html |archivedate=2016-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is accompanied as a philosophy and in fiction by two earlier evolutionary theories, progressionism ([[orthogenesis]]) and [[Lamarckism]].&lt;ref name=SFE/&gt; Progressionism is the view that evolution is progress towards some goal of perfection, and that it is in some way directed towards that goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ruse |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Ruse |date=1996 |title=Monad to man: the Concept of Progress in Evolutionary Biology |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-03248-4 |pages=526–539}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lamarckism, a philosophy that long predates [[Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck]], is the view that evolution is guided by the inheritance of characteristics acquired by use or disuse during an animal's lifetime.&lt;ref name=Zirkle1935&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Zirkle | first1=Conway | authorlink=Conway Zirkle | year=1935 | title=The Inheritance of Acquired Characters and the Provisional Hypothesis of Pangenesis| journal=[[The American Naturalist]] | volume=69 | issue=| pages=417–445 | doi=10.1086/280617}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Progressionism==
{{see|Orthogenesis}}

Ideas of progress and evolution were popular, long before Darwinism, in the 18th century, leading to [[Nicolas-Edme Rétif]]'s allegorical 1781 story ''{{ill|La découverte Australe par un homme volant|fr|La Découverte australe}}'' (The Southern Hemisphere Discovery by a Flying Man).&lt;ref name=SFE/&gt; 

The evolutionary biologist Kayla M. Hardwick quotes from the 2013 film ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'', where the villain Faora states: "The fact that you possess a sense of morality, and we do not, gives us an evolutionary advantage. And if history has taught us anything, it is that evolution always wins." She points out that the idea that evolution wins is progressionist, while (she argues) the idea that evolution gives evil an advantage over the moral and good, driving the creation of formidable monsters, is a popular science fiction misconception.&lt;ref name=Hardwick2014&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hardwick |first1=Kayla M. |title=Natural selection at the movies: Only the bad guys evolve |url=https://nothinginbiology.org/2014/10/22/natural-selection-at-the-movies-only-the-bad-guys-evolve/ |website=Nothing in Biology Makes Sense [except in the light of evolution] |accessdate=24 July 2018 |date=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardwick gives as examples of the evolution of "bad-guy traits" the [[Morlock]]s in [[H. G. Wells]]'s 1895 ''[[The Time Machine]]'', the bugs' [[caste (insect)|caste system]] in [[Robert Heinlein]]'s 1959 ''[[Starship Troopers]]'', and the effective colonisation by [[Don Siegel]]'s 1956 ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]'' aliens.&lt;ref name=Hardwick2014/&gt;

==Lamarckism==
{{see|Lamarckism}}

In French 19th century literature, evolutionary fantasy was Lamarckian, as seen in [[Camille Flammarion]]'s 1887 ''Lumen'' and his 1894 ''[[Omega: The Last Days of the World]]'', [[J.-H. Rosny]]'s 1887 ''Les Xipéhuz'' and his 1910 ''La mort de la terre'', and [[Jules Verne]]'s 1901 ''La grande forêt, le village aérien''. The Lamarckist philosopher [[Henri Bergson]]'s creative evolution driven by the supposed [[élan vital]] likely inspired [[J. D. Beresford]]'s English evolutionary fantasy, his 1911 ''[[The Hampdenshire Wonder]]''.&lt;ref name=SFE/&gt;

==Darwinism==
[[File:Alvim-correa12.jpg|thumb|Illustration for a 1906 edition of [[H. G. Wells]]'s 1898 "[[The War of the Worlds]]" by [[Henrique Alvim Corréa]]]]
{{see|Speculative evolution}}

Darwin's version of evolution has been widely explored in fiction, both in fantasies and in imaginative explorations of its grimmer "[[survival of the fittest]]" effects, with much attention focused on possible human evolution. H. G. Wells's ''The Time Machine'' already mentioned, his 1896 ''[[The Island of Dr Moreau]]'', and his 1898 ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' all pessimistically explore the possible dire consequences of the darker sides of human nature in the struggle for survival.&lt;ref name=SFE/&gt; More broadly, [[Joseph Conrad]]'s 1899 ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' and [[R. L. Stevenson]]'s 1886 ''[[Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'' portray Darwinian thinking in mainstream [[English literature]].&lt;ref name="NYT1986"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Levine |first1=George |title=Darwin and the Evolution of Fiction |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/05/books/darwin-and-the-evolution-of-fiction.html |accessdate=24 July 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=5 October 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evolutionary biologist [[J. B. S. Haldane]] wrote an optimistic tale, ''The Last Judgement'', in the 1927 collection ''Possible Worlds''. This influenced [[Olaf Stapledon]]'s 1930 ''[[Last and First Men]]'', which portrays the many species that evolved from humans in a billion-year timeframe. A different take on Darwinism is the idea, popular from the 1950s onwards, that humans will evolve more or less godlike mental capacity, as in [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s 1950 ''[[Childhood's End]]'' and [[Brian Aldiss]]'s 1959 ''[[Galaxies Like Grains of Sand]]''. Another science fiction theme is the replacement of humanity on Earth by other species or [[intelligent machine]]s. For instance, [[Olof Johannesson]]'s 1966 ''The Great Computer'' gives humans the role of enabling intelligent machines to evolve, while [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s 1985 ''Galapagos'' is one of several novels to depict a replacement species.&lt;ref name=SFE/&gt;

'''Geothermal energy''' is [[thermal energy]] generated and stored in the Earth. Thermal energy is the energy that determines the [[temperature]] of matter. The geothermal energy of the Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]] originates from the original formation of the planet and from [[radioactive decay]] of materials (in currently uncertain&lt;ref name=Dye&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dye, S. T. |title=Geoneutrinos and the radioactive power of the Earth|journal=Reviews of Geophysics|volume=50|issue=3|pages=RG3007|doi=10.1029/2012RG000400|year=2012|arxiv = 1111.6099 |bibcode = 2012RvGeo..50.3007D }}&lt;/ref&gt; but possibly roughly equal&lt;ref name=Gando&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gando, A. |author2=Dwyer, D.

The [[geothermal gradient]], which is the difference in temperature between the core of the planet and its surface, drives a continuous [[Thermal conduction|conduction of thermal energy]] in the form of [[heat]] from the core to the surface. The adjective ''geothermal'' originates from the Greek roots ''γη (ge)'', meaning earth, and ''θερμος (thermos)'', meaning hot.

[[Earth's internal heat budget|Earth's internal heat]] is thermal energy generated from radioactive decay and continual heat loss from Earth's formation.&lt;ref name=turcotte/&gt; Temperatures at the [[core–mantle boundary]] may reach over 4000&amp;nbsp;°C (7,200&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |doi=10.1038/ngeo.2007.44|title=Core–mantle boundary heat flow|journal=Nature Geoscience|volume=1|pages=25–32|year=2008|last1=Lay|first1=Thorne|last2=Hernlund|first2=John|last3=Buffett|first3=Bruce A.|bibcode=2008NatGe...1...25L}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high temperature and pressure in Earth's interior cause some rock to melt and solid [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] to behave plastically, resulting in portions of the [[mantle convection|mantle convecting]] upward since it is lighter than the surrounding rock. Rock and water is heated in the crust, sometimes up to 370&amp;nbsp;°C (700&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Nemzer |first=J |title=Geothermal heating and cooling |url=http://www.geothermal.marin.org/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19980111021839/http://geothermal.marin.org/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=1998-01-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With water from [[hot springs]], geothermal energy has been used for bathing since [[Paleolithic]] times and for [[space heating]] since ancient Roman times, but it is now better known for [[electricity generation]]. Worldwide, 11,700 [[megawatts]] (MW) of geothermal power was available in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/about-bp/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy/review-by-energy-type/renewable-energy/geothermal-capacity.html |title=Geothermal capacity &amp;#124; About BP &amp;#124; BP Global |publisher=Bp.com |accessdate=2014-11-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129051911/http://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/about-bp/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy/review-by-energy-type/renewable-energy/geothermal-capacity.html |archivedate=2014-11-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional 28 gigawatts of direct [[geothermal heating]] capacity is installed for district heating, space heating, spas, industrial processes, desalination and agricultural applications as of 2010.&lt;ref name="IPCC"/&gt;

Geothermal power is cost-effective, reliable, sustainable, and environmentally friendly,&lt;ref&gt;Glassley, William E. (2010). ''Geothermal Energy: Renewable Energy and the Environment'', CRC Press, {{ISBN|9781420075700}}.{{page needed|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has historically been limited to areas near [[tectonic plate boundaries]]. Recent technological advances have dramatically expanded the range and size of viable resources, especially for applications such as home heating, opening a potential for widespread exploitation. Geothermal wells release greenhouse gases trapped deep within the earth, but these emissions are much lower per energy unit than those of fossil fuels.

The Earth's geothermal resources are theoretically more than adequate to supply humanity's energy needs, but only a very small fraction may be profitably exploited. Drilling and exploration for deep resources is very expensive. Forecasts for the future of geothermal power depend on assumptions about technology, energy prices, subsidies, plate boundary movement and interest rates. Pilot programs like EWEB's customer opt in Green Power Program&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eweb.org/greenpower Green Power]. eweb.org&lt;/ref&gt; show that customers would be willing to pay a little more for a renewable energy source like geothermal. But as a result of government assisted research and industry experience, the cost of generating geothermal power has decreased by 25% over the past two decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Cothran|first=Helen|title=Energy Alternatives|year=2002|publisher=Greenhaven Press|isbn=978-0737709049}}{{page needed|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, geothermal energy costs between two and ten US cents per kWh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |doi=10.1016/S1364-0321(01)00002-8|title=Geothermal energy for the benefit of the people|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|volume=5|issue=3|pages=299–312|year=2001|last1=Fridleifsson|first1=Ingvar B|citeseerx=10.1.1.459.1779}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[thermal efficiency]] of geothermal electric plants is low, around 10–23%, because geothermal fluids do not reach the high temperatures of steam from boilers. The laws of [[thermodynamics]] limits the efficiency of [[Cycle efficiency|heat engines]] in extracting useful energy. Exhaust heat is wasted, unless it can be used directly and locally, for example in greenhouses, timber mills, and district heating. System efficiency does not materially affect operational costs as it would for plants that use fuel, but it does affect return on the capital used to build the plant. In order to produce more energy than the pumps consume, electricity generation requires relatively hot fields and specialized heat cycles.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Because geothermal power does not rely on variable sources of energy, unlike, for example, wind or solar, its [[capacity factor]] can be quite large – up to 96% has been demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The global average was 73% in 2005.

==Types==
Geothermal energy comes in either ''vapor-dominated'' or ''liquid-dominated'' forms. [[Larderello]] and [[The Geysers]] are vapor-dominated. Vapor-dominated sites offer temperatures from 240 to 300&amp;nbsp;°C that produce superheated steam.

===Liquid-dominated plants===
Liquid-dominated reservoirs (LDRs) were more common with temperatures greater than {{convert|200|C}} and are found near young volcanoes surrounding the Pacific Ocean and in rift zones and hot spots. ''Flash plants'' are the common way to generate electricity from these sources. Pumps are generally not required, powered instead when the water turns to steam. Most wells generate 2-10 MWe. Steam is separated from liquid via cyclone separators, while the liquid is returned to the reservoir for reheating/reuse. As of 2013, the largest liquid system is [[Cerro Prieto]] in Mexico, which generates 750 MWe from temperatures reaching {{convert|350|C|F}}. The [[Salton Sea]] field in Southern California offers the potential of generating 2000 MWe.&lt;ref name=sci2013/&gt;

Lower temperature LDRs (120–200&amp;nbsp;°C) require pumping. They are common in extensional terrains, where heating takes place via deep circulation along faults, such as in the Western US and Turkey. Water passes through a [[heat exchanger]] in a [[Rankine cycle]] binary plant. The water vaporizes an organic working fluid that drives a [[turbine]]. These binary plants originated in the Soviet Union in the late 1960s and predominate in new US plants. Binary plants have no emissions.&lt;ref name=sci2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=eere&gt;[http://www1.eere.energy.gov/geothermal/low_temperature_resources.html Low-Temperature and Co-produced Geothermal Resources]. U.S. Department of Energy.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thermal energy===
{{Main article|Geothermal heating|geothermal heat pump}}
Lower temperature sources produce the energy equivalent of 100M BBL per year. Sources with temperatures of 30–150&amp;nbsp;°C are used without conversion to electricity as [[district heating]], [[greenhouse]]s, [[fisheries]], mineral recovery, industrial process heating and bathing in 75 countries. Heat pumps extract energy from shallow sources at 10–20&amp;nbsp;°C in 43 countries for use in space heating and cooling. Home heating is the fastest-growing means of exploiting geothermal energy, with global annual growth rate of 30% in 2005&lt;ref&gt;

Approximately 270&amp;nbsp;petajoules&amp;nbsp;(PJ) of geothermal heating was used in 2004. More than half went for space heating, and another third for heated pools. The remainder supported industrial and agricultural applications. Global installed capacity was 28&amp;nbsp;GW, but capacity factors tend to be low (30% on average) since heat is mostly needed in winter. Some 88&amp;nbsp;PJ for space heating was extracted by an estimated 1.3&amp;nbsp;million [[geothermal heat pump]]s with a total capacity of 15 GW.&lt;ref name="IPCC"&gt;

Heat for these purposes may also be extracted from co-generation at a [[geothermal electrical plant]].

Heating is cost-effective at many more sites than electricity generation. At natural hot springs or [[geysers]], water can be piped directly into [[radiators]]. In hot, dry ground, [[earth tubes]] or [[downhole heat exchanger]]s can collect the heat. However, even in areas where the ground is colder than room temperature, heat can often be extracted with a geothermal heat pump more cost-effectively and cleanly than by conventional furnaces.&lt;ref name="strategic" /&gt; These devices draw on much shallower and colder resources than traditional geothermal techniques. They frequently combine functions, including [[air conditioning]], [[seasonal thermal energy storage]], [[solar energy]] collection, and electric heating. Heat pumps can be used for space heating essentially anywhere.

Iceland is the world leader in direct applications. Some 92.5% of its homes are heated with geothermal energy, saving Iceland over $100 million annually in avoided oil imports. [[Reykjavík]], [[Iceland]] has the world's biggest district heating system, often used to heat pathways and roads to hinder the accumulation of ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reykjavik: The ground heats the city - Danish Architecture Centre|url=http://www.dac.dk/en/dac-cities/sustainable-cities/all-cases/energy/reykjavik-the-ground-heats-the-city/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160825132818/http://www.dac.dk/en/dac-cities/sustainable-cities/all-cases/energy/reykjavik-the-ground-heats-the-city/|archivedate=2016-08-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once known as the most polluted city in the world, it is now one of the cleanest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Pahl|first=Greg|title=The Citizen-Powered Energy Handbook: Community Solutions to a Global Crisis|year=2007|publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing|location=Vermont}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enhanced geothermal===
{{Main article|Enhanced geothermal system}}
Enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) actively inject water into wells to be heated and pumped back out. The water is injected under high pressure to expand existing rock fissures to enable the water to freely flow in and out. The technique was adapted from oil and gas extraction techniques. However, the geologic formations are deeper and no toxic chemicals are used, reducing the possibility of environmental damage. Drillers can employ [[directional drilling]] to expand the size of the reservoir.&lt;ref name=sci2013/&gt;

Small-scale EGS have been installed in the [[Rhine Graben]] at [[Soultz-sous-Forêts]] in France and at [[Landau]] and [[Insheim]] in Germany.&lt;ref name=sci2013/&gt;

==Economics==
Geothermal power requires no fuel (except for pumps), and is therefore immune to fuel cost fluctuations. However, capital costs are significant. Drilling accounts for over half the costs, and exploration of deep resources entails significant risks. A typical well doublet (extraction and injection wells) in [[Nevada]] can support 4.5 [[megawatt]]s (MW) and costs about $10&amp;nbsp;million to drill, with a 20% failure rate.&lt;ref name="econ101"&gt;

In total, electrical plant construction and well drilling cost about €2–5&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;per&amp;nbsp;MW of electrical capacity, while the [[levelised energy cost|break–even]] price is 0.04–0.10&amp;nbsp;€ per&amp;nbsp;kW·h.&lt;ref name="Bertani" /&gt; Enhanced geothermal systems tend to be on the high side of these ranges, with capital costs above $4&amp;nbsp;million per&amp;nbsp;MW and break–even above $0.054 per&amp;nbsp;kW·h in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Direct heating applications can use much shallower wells with lower temperatures, so smaller systems with lower costs and risks are feasible. Residential geothermal heat pumps with a capacity of 10&amp;nbsp;kilowatt (kW) are routinely installed for around $1–3,000 per&amp;nbsp;kilowatt. District heating systems may benefit from economies of scale if demand is geographically dense, as in cities and greenhouses, but otherwise piping installation dominates capital costs. The capital cost of one such district heating system in [[Bavaria]] was estimated at somewhat over 1&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;€ per&amp;nbsp;MW.&lt;ref&gt;In the Netherlands the number of greenhouses heated by geothermal energy is increasing fast.

Geothermal projects have several stages of development. Each phase has associated risks. At the early stages of reconnaissance and geophysical surveys, many projects are cancelled, making that phase unsuitable for traditional lending. Projects moving forward from the identification, exploration and exploratory drilling often trade equity for financing.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These power rates are more than double humanity’s current energy consumption from all primary sources, but most of this energy flow is not recoverable. In addition to the internal heat flows, the top layer of the surface to a depth of {{convert|10|m|ft|sp=us}} is heated by solar energy during the summer, and releases that energy and cools during the winter.

Outside of the seasonal variations, the [[geothermal gradient]] of temperatures through the crust is 25–30&amp;nbsp;°C (77–86&amp;nbsp;°F) per kilometer of depth in most of the world. The conductive heat [[flux]] averages 0.1&amp;nbsp;MW/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. These values are much higher near tectonic plate boundaries where the crust is thinner. They may be further augmented by fluid circulation, either through [[magma conduit]]s, [[hot springs]], [[hydrothermal circulation]] or a combination of these.

A geothermal heat pump can extract enough heat from shallow ground anywhere in the world to provide home heating, but industrial applications need the higher temperatures of deep resources.&lt;ref name="utilization" /&gt; The thermal efficiency and profitability of electricity generation is particularly sensitive to temperature. The most demanding applications receive the greatest benefit from a high natural heat flux, ideally from using a [[hot spring]]. The next best option is to drill a well into a hot [[aquifer]]. If no adequate aquifer is available, an artificial one may be built by injecting water to [[hydraulically fracture]] the bedrock. This last approach is called [[hot dry rock geothermal energy]] in Europe, or [[enhanced geothermal systems]] in North America. Much greater potential may be available from this approach than from conventional tapping of natural aquifers.&lt;ref name="INEL"&gt;{{Citation

[[Myanmar Engineering Society]] has identified at least 39 locations (in [[Myanmar]]) capable of geothermal power production and some of these hydrothermal reservoirs lie quite close to [[Yangon]] which is a significant underutilized resource.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last=DuByne| first=David| title= Geothermal Energy in Myanmar Securing Electricity for Eastern Border Development  | journal=Myanmar Business Today Magazine |date=November 2015| url=http://www.oilseedcrops.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Geothermal-Energy-in-Myanmar-Securing-Electricity-for-Eastern-Border-Development-David-DuByne.pdf|pages=6–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
According to the Geothermal Energy Association (GEA) installed geothermal capacity in the United States grew by 5%, or 147.05 MW, ce the last annual survey in March 2012. This increase came from seven geothermal projects that began production in 2012. GEA also revised its 2011 estimate of installed capacity upward by 128 MW, bringing current installed U.S. geothermal capacity to 3,386 MW.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://geo-energy.org/pressReleases/2013/GEA2013UpdateRelease.aspx |title=GEA Update Release 2013 |publisher=Geo-energy.org |date=2013-02-26 |accessdate=2013-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renewability and sustainability==
Geothermal power is considered to be [[Renewable energy|renewable]] because any projected heat extraction is small compared to the Earth's heat content. The Earth has an internal heat content of [[1 E31 J|10&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;joules]] (3·10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;TW·hr), approximately 100 billion times current (2010) worldwide annual energy consumption.&lt;ref name="IPCC" /&gt; About 20% of this is residual heat from [[planetary accretion]], and the remainder is attributed to higher radioactive decay rates that existed in the past.&lt;ref name="turcotte"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural heat flows are not in equilibrium, and the planet is slowly cooling down on geologic timescales. Human extraction taps a minute fraction of the natural outflow, often without accelerating it.{{clarify|reason=When would tapping heat not accelerate the cooling? Minutely, yes, but still.|date=May 2015}}

Geothermal power is also considered to be [[Sustainable energy|sustainable]] thanks to its power to sustain the Earth’s intricate ecosystems. By using geothermal sources of energy present generations of humans will not endanger the capability of future generations to use their own resources to the same amount that those energy sources are presently used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Is Geothermal Energy Renewable and Sustainable|url=http://www.energyauditorhq.com/is-geothermal-energy-renewable-and-sustainable/|work=Energy Auditor: Your Headquarters For Smart Sustainable Living:|accessdate=9 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130608044704/http://www.energyauditorhq.com/is-geothermal-energy-renewable-and-sustainable/|archive-date=2013-06-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, due to its low emissions geothermal energy is considered to have excellent potential for mitigation of global warming.

Even though geothermal power is globally sustainable, extraction must still be monitored to avoid local depletion.&lt;ref name="sustainability" /&gt; Over the course of decades, individual wells draw down local temperatures and water levels until a new equilibrium is reached with natural flows. The three oldest sites, at [[Larderello]], [[Wairakei]], and the Geysers have experienced reduced output because of local depletion. Heat and water, in uncertain proportions, were extracted faster than they were replenished. If production is reduced and water is reinjected, these wells could theoretically recover their full potential. Such mitigation strategies have already been implemented at some sites. The long-term sustainability of geothermal energy has been demonstrated at the Lardarello field in [[Italy]] since 1913, at the Wairakei field in [[New Zealand]] since 1958,&lt;ref name="Wairakei"&gt;

Falling electricity production may be boosted through drilling additional supply boreholes, as at [[Poihipi Power Station|Poihipi]] and [[Ohaaki Power Station|Ohaaki]]. The [[Wairakei Power Station|Wairakei]] power station has been running much longer, with its first unit commissioned in November 1958, and it attained its peak generation of 173MW in 1965, but already the supply of high-pressure steam was faltering, in 1982 being derated to intermediate pressure and the station managing 157MW. Around the start of the 21st century it was managing about 150MW, then in 2005 two 8MW isopentane systems were added, boosting the station's output by about 14MW. Detailed data are unavailable, being lost due to re-organisations. One such re-organisation in 1996 causes the absence of early data for Poihipi (started 1996), and the gap in 1996/7 for Wairakei and Ohaaki; half-hourly data for Ohaaki's first few months of operation are also missing, as well as for most of Wairakei's history.

Direct geothermal heating systems contain pumps and compressors, which may consume energy from a polluting source. This [[parasitic load]] is normally a fraction of the heat output, so it is always less polluting than electric heating. However, if the electricity is produced by burning fossil fuels, then the net emissions of geothermal heating may be comparable to directly burning the fuel for heat. For example, a geothermal heat pump powered by electricity from a [[combined cycle]] [[natural gas]] plant would produce about as much pollution as a natural gas [[condensing furnace]] of the same size.&lt;ref name="strategic"&gt;

==Legal frameworks==
Some of the legal issues raised by geothermal energy resources include questions of ownership and allocation of the resource, the grant of exploration permits, exploitation rights, royalties, and the extent to which geothermal energy issues have been recognized in existing planning and environmental laws. Other questions concern overlap between geothermal and mineral or petroleum tenements. Broader issues concern the extent to which the legal framework for encouragement of renewable energy assists in encouraging geothermal industry innovation and development.

'''Historicism''' is the idea of attributing meaningful significance to space and time, such as historical period, geographical place, and local culture. Historicism tends to be [[hermeneutics|hermeneutical]] because it values cautious, rigorous, and contextualized interpretation of information; or [[relativism|relativist]], because it rejects notions of universal, fundamental and immutable interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;Kahan, Jeffrey. "Historicism." ''Renaissance Quarterly'', vol. 50, no. 4 December 22, 1997, p. 1202&lt;/ref&gt; The approach varies from individualist theories of knowledge such as [[empiricism]] and [[rationalism]], which neglect the role of [[tradition]]s.

The term "historicism" (''Historismus'') was coined by German philosopher [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel]].&lt;ref&gt;Brian Leiter, Michael Rosen (eds.), ''The Oxford Handbook of Continental Philosophy'', Oxford University Press, 2007, p. 175: "[The word 'historicism'] appears as early as the late eighteenth century in the writings of the German romantics, who used it in a neutral sense. In 1797 Friedrich Schlegel used 'historicism' to refer to a philosophy that stresses the importance of history..."; Katherine Harloe, Neville Morley (eds.), ''Thucydides and the Modern World: Reception, Reinterpretation and Influence from the Renaissance to the Present'', Cambridge University Press, 2012, p. 81: "Already in   Friedrich Schlegel's ''Fragments about Poetry and Literature'' (a collection of notes attributed to 1797), the word ''Historismus'' occurs five times."&lt;/ref&gt; Over time it has developed different and somewhat divergent meanings. Elements of historicism appear in the writings of French essayist [[Michel de Montaigne]] (1533–1592) and Italian philosopher [[G. B. Vico]] (1668–1744), and became more fully developed with the [[dialectic]] of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Georg Hegel]] (1770–1831), influential in 19th-century Europe. The writings of [[Karl Marx]], influenced by Hegel, also include historicism. The term is also associated with the empirical social sciences and with the work of [[Franz Boas]].

Historicism may be contrasted with [[reductionism|reductionist]] theories—which assumes that all developments can be explained by fundamental principles (such as in [[economic determinism]])—or with theories that posit that historical changes occur as a result of random chance.

The Austrian-English philosopher [[Karl Popper]] condemned historicism along with the [[determinism]] and [[holism]] which he argued formed its basis. In his ''[[Poverty of Historicism]]'', he identified historicism with the opinion that there are "inexorable laws of historical destiny", which opinion he warned against. This contrasts with the contextually relative interpretation of historicism for which its proponents argue. [[Talcott Parsons]] criticized historicism as a case of idealistic fallacy in ''The Structure of Social Action'' (1937).

[[Post-structuralism]] uses the term "[[New Historicism]]", which has some associations with both anthropology and Hegelianism.

The [[#Christian historicism|theological use]] of the word denotes the interpretation of biblical prophecy as being related to church history.

===Hegelian===
[[File:G.W.F. Hegel (by Sichling, after Sebbers).jpg|right|thumb|G. W. F. Hegel (1770–1831)]]

Hegel viewed the realization of human freedom as the ultimate purpose of history, which could only be achieved through the creation of the perfect state. And this progressive history would only occur through a dialectical process: namely, the tension between the purpose of humankind (freedom), the position that humankind currently finds itself, and mankind's attempt to bend the current world into accord with its nature. However, because humans are often not aware of the goal of both humanity and history, the process of achieving freedom is necessarily one of self-discovery. Hegel also saw the progress toward freedom being conducted by the "spirit" (Geist), a seemingly supernatural force that directed all human actions and interactions. Yet Hegel makes clear that the spirit is a mere abstraction, and only comes into existence "through the activity of finite agents." Thus, Hegel's philosophy of history is not necessarily metaphysical, despite the fact that many of Hegel's opponents and interpreters have understood Hegel's philosophy of history as a metaphysical and determinist view of history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to Hegel|last=Beiser|first=Frederick C.|publisher=Cambridge University PRess|year=1993|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=289–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Karl Popper in his book ''The Poverty of Historicism'' interpreted Hegel's philosophy of history as metaphysical and deterministic. Popper referred to this "Hegelian" philosophy of history as ''Historicism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Poverty of Historicism|last=Popper|first=Karl Popper|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=1957|isbn=|location=London|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel's historicism also suggests that any human [[society]] and all human activities such as [[science]], [[art]], or [[philosophy]], are defined by their history. Consequently, their essence can be sought only by understanding said history. The history of any such human endeavor, moreover, not only continues but also reacts against what has gone before; this is the source of Hegel's famous dialectic teaching usually summarized by the slogan "[[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|thesis, antithesis, and synthesis]]".  (Hegel did not use these terms, although [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Johann Fichte]] did.) Hegel's famous [[aphorism]], "Philosophy is the history of philosophy," describes it bluntly.

Hegel's position is perhaps best illuminated when contrasted against the atomistic and reductionist opinion of human societies and social activities self-defining on an ''ad hoc'' basis through the sum of dozens of interactions. Yet another contrasting model is the persistent metaphor of a [[social contract]].  Hegel considers the relationship between individuals and societies as organic, not atomic: even their social discourse is mediated by [[philosophy of language|language]], and language is based on [[etymology]] and unique character. It thus preserves the culture of the past in thousands of half-forgotten [[metaphor]]s.  To understand why a person is the way he is, you must examine that person in his society: and to understand that society, you must understand its history, and the forces that influenced it.  The ''[[Zeitgeist]]'', the "Spirit of the Age," is the concrete embodiment of the most important factors that are acting in human history at any given time. This contrasts with teleological theories of activity, which suppose that the end is the determining factor of activity, as well as those who believe in a [[tabula rasa]], or blank slate, opinion, such that individuals are defined by their interactions.

These ideas can be interpreted variously.  The [[Right Hegelians]], working from Hegel's opinions about the organicism and historically determined nature of human societies, interpreted Hegel's historicism as a justification of the unique destiny of national groups and the importance of stability and institutions.  Hegel's conception of human societies as entities greater than the individuals who constitute them influenced nineteenth-century [[romantic nationalism]] and its twentieth-century excesses.  The [[Young Hegelians]], by contrast, interpreted Hegel's thoughts on societies influenced by social conflict for a doctrine of [[social progress]], and attempted to manipulate these forces to cause various  results.  Karl Marx's doctrine of "historical inevitabilities" and [[historical materialism]] is one of the more influential reactions to this part of Hegel's thought.  Significantly, Karl Marx's [[Marx's theory of alienation|theory of alienation]] argues that [[capitalism]] disrupts traditional relationships between workers and their work.

Hegelian historicism is related to his ideas on the means by which human societies progress, specifically the [[Hegelian dialectic|dialectic]] and his conception of logic as representing the inner essential nature of reality. Hegel attributes the change to the "modern" need to interact with the world, whereas ancient philosophers were self-contained, and medieval philosophers were monks. In his History of Philosophy Hegel writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In modern times things are very different; now we no longer see philosophic individuals who constitute a class by themselves. With the present day all difference has disappeared; philosophers are not monks, for we find them generally in connection with the world, participating with others in some common work or calling. They live, not independently, but in the relation of citizens, or they occupy public offices and take part in the life of the state. Certainly they may be private persons, but if so, their position as such does not in any way isolate them from their other relationship. They are involved in present conditions, in the world and its work and progress. Thus their philosophy is only by the way, a sort of luxury and superfluity. This difference is really to be found in the manner in which outward conditions have taken shape after the building up of the inward world of religion. In modern times, namely, on account of the reconciliation of the worldly principle with itself, the external world is at rest, is brought into order — worldly relationships, conditions, modes of life, have become constituted and organized in a manner which is conformable to nature and rational. We see a universal, comprehensible connection, and with that individuality likewise attains another character and nature, for it is no longer the plastic individuality of the ancients. This connection is of such power that every individuality is under its dominion, and yet at the same time can construct for itself an inward world.&lt;ref name=LecturesOnTheHistoryOfPhilosophyVolume3&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Lectures_on_the_History_of_Philosophy.html?id=ik05WhN4ga0C&amp;pg=PA167#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Lectures on the History of Philosophy, Volume 3"], By Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Translated by E. S. Haldane and Frances H. Simson, M. A., ''University of Nebraska Press'', 1995&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This opinion that entanglement in society creates an indissoluble bond with expression, would become an influential question in philosophy, namely, the requirements for individuality.  It would be considered by [[Nietzsche]], [[John Dewey]] and [[Michel Foucault]] directly, as well as in the work of numerous artists and authors. There have been various responses to Hegel's challenge. The Romantic period emphasized the ability of individual genius to transcend time and place, and use the materials from their heritage to fashion works which were beyond determination. The modern would advance versions of John Locke's infinite malleability of the human animal. Post-structuralism would argue that since history is not present, but only the image of history, that while an individual era or power structure might emphasize a particular history, that the contradictions within the story would hinder the very purposes that the history was constructed to advance.

===Anthropological&lt;!--'Anthropological historicism'--&gt;===
In the context of [[anthropology]] and other sciences which study the past, historicism has a different meaning. '''Anthropological historicism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Byron Kaldis (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy and the Social Sciences'', SAGE Publications, 2013, p. 421.&lt;/ref&gt; is associated with the work of [[Franz Boas]]. His theory used the [[Diffusion (anthropology)|diffusionist]] concept that there were a few "cradles of civilization" which grew outwards, and merged it with the idea that societies would adapt to their circumstances, which is called [[historical particularism]]. The school of historicism grew in response to [[Classical social evolutionism|unilinear theories]] that social development represented adaptive fitness, and therefore existed on a continuum. While these theories were espoused by [[Charles Darwin]] and many of his students, their application as applied in [[social Darwinism]] and [[general evolution]] characterized in the theories of [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[Leslie White]], historicism was neither anti-selection, nor anti-evolution, as Darwin never attempted nor offered an explanation for cultural evolution. However, it attacked the notion that there was one normative spectrum of development, instead emphasizing how local conditions would create adaptations to the local environment. [[Julian Steward]] refuted the viability of globally and universally applicable adaptive standards proposing that culture was honed adaptively in response to the idiosyncrasies of the local environment, the [[cultural ecology]], by [[specific evolution]]. What was adaptive for one region might not be so for another. This conclusion has likewise been adopted by modern forms of biological evolutionary theory.

The primary method of historicism was empirical, namely that there were so many requisite inputs into a society or event, that only by emphasizing the data available could a theory of the source be determined. In this opinion, grand theories are unprovable, and instead intensive field work would determine the most likely explanation and history of a culture, and hence it is named "historicism."

This opinion would produce a wide range of definition of what, exactly, constituted culture and history, but in each case the only means of explaining it was in terms of the historical particulars of the culture itself.

===New===
{{main|New Historicism}}
Since the 1950s, when [[Jacques Lacan]] and Foucault argued that each epoch has its own knowledge system, within which individuals are inexorably entangled, many [[post-structuralist]]s have used ''historicism'' to describe the opinion that all questions must be settled within the cultural and social context in which they are raised. Answers cannot be found by appeal to an external truth, but only within the confines of the norms and forms that phrase the question.  This version of historicism holds that there are only the raw texts, markings and artifacts that exist in the present, and the conventions used to decode them. This school of thought is sometimes given the name of ''New Historicism''.

The same term, ''new historicism'' is also used for a school of literary scholarship which interprets a [[poem]], [[drama]], etc. as an expression of or reaction to the power-structures of its society. [[Stephen Greenblatt]] is an example of this school.

===Modern===
Within the context of 20th-century philosophy, debates continue as to whether ahistorical and immanent methods were sufficient to understand meaning—that is to say, "what you see is what you get" positivism—or whether context, background and culture are important beyond the mere need to decode words, phrases and references. While post-structural historicism is relativist in its orientation, that is, it sees each culture as its own frame of reference, a large number of thinkers have embraced the need for historical context, not because culture is self-referential, but because there is no more compressed means of conveying all of the relevant information except through history. This opinion is often seen as deriving from the work of [[Benedetto Croce]]. Recent historians using this tradition include [[Thomas Kuhn]].

===Christian===
{{main|Historicism (Christian eschatology)}}

====Eschatological====
In [[Christianity]], the term ''historicism'' refers to the confessional [[Protestantism|Protestant]] form of prophetical interpretation which holds that the fulfillment of [[Bible|biblical]] [[prophecy]] has occurred throughout history and continues to occur; as opposed to other methods which limit the time-frame of prophecy-fulfillment to the past or to the future.

====Dogmatic and ecclesiastic====
There is also a particular opinion in [[ecclesiastical history]] and in the [[History of Catholic dogmatic theology|history of dogmas]] which has been described as historicist by Pope [[Pius XII]] in the encyclical ''[[Humani generis]]''. "They add that the history of dogmas consists in the reporting of the various forms in which revealed truth has been clothed, forms that have succeeded one another in accordance with the different teachings and opinions that have arisen over the course of the centuries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Pius XII |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_12081950_humani-generis_en.html |title=Humani generis, 15 |publisher=[[Vatican.va]] |date= |accessdate=2012-05-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419021937/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_12081950_humani-generis_en.html |archivedate=2012-04-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critics==

===Karl Marx===
The social theory of Karl Marx, with respect to modern scholarship, has an ambiguous relation to historicism. Critics of Marx have charged his theory with historicism since its very genesis. However, the issue of historicism also finds itself important to many debates within Marxism itself; the charge of historicism has been made against various types of Marxism, typically disparaged by Marxists as "vulgar" Marxism.

Marx himself expresses critical concerns with this historicist tendency in his [[Theses on Feuerbach]]:
{{quote|The materialist doctrine that men are products of circumstances and upbringing, and that, therefore, changed men are products of changed circumstances and changed upbringing, forgets that it is men who change circumstances and that the educator must himself be educated. Hence this doctrine is bound to divide society into two parts, one of which is superior to society. The coincidence of the changing of circumstances and of human activity or self-change [Selbstveränderung] can be conceived and rationally understood only as revolutionary [[praxis (process)|practice]].&lt;ref name="Theses on Feuerbach"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/theses/index.htm | title = Theses on Feuerbach | website = | publisher = | accessdate = February 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Karl Popper===

[[Karl Popper]] used the term ''historicism'' in his influential books ''[[The Poverty of Historicism]]'' and ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'', to mean: "an approach to the social sciences which assumes that ''historical prediction'' is their primary aim, and which assumes that this aim is attainable by discovering the 'rhythms' or the 'patterns', the 'laws' or the 'trends' that underlie the evolution of history".&lt;ref name = "Poverty 3"&gt;POPPER, Karl, p. 3 of ''The Poverty of Historicism'', italics in original&lt;/ref&gt; Karl Popper wrote with reference to [[Hegel]]'s theory of [[history]], which he criticized extensively. However, there is wide dispute whether Popper's description of "historicism" is an accurate description of Hegel, or more his characterisation of his own philosophical antagonists, including [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] thought, then widely held as posing a challenge to the philosophical basis of the [[Western world|West]], as well as theories such as [[Oswald Spengler|Spengler's]] which drew predictions about the future course of events from the past.

In ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'', Popper attacks "historicism" and its proponents, among whom (as well as Hegel) he identifies and singles out [[Plato]] and [[Marx]]—calling them all "enemies of the open society".  The objection he makes is that historicist positions, by claiming that there is an inevitable and deterministic pattern to history, abrogate the [[democracy|democratic]] responsibility of each one of us to make our own free contributions to the evolution of society, and hence lead to [[totalitarianism]].

Another of his targets is what he terms "moral historicism", the attempt to infer moral values from the course of history; in Hegel's words, that "history is the world's court of justice".  This may take the form of conservatism (former might is right), positivism (might is right) or futurism (presumed coming might is right). As against these, Popper says that he does not believe "that success proves anything or that history is our judge".&lt;ref&gt;''The Open Society and its Enemies'', vol. 2 p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Futurism must be distinguished from prophecies that the right will prevail: these attempt to infer history from ethics, rather than ethics from history, and are therefore historicism in the normal sense rather than moral historicism.

He also attacks what he calls "[[Historism]]", which he regards as distinct from historicism.  By historism, he means the tendency to regard every argument or idea as completely accounted for by its historical context, as opposed to assessing it by its merits.  In Popperian terms, the "[[New Historicism]]" is an example of historism rather than of historicism proper.

===Leo Strauss===
[[Leo Strauss]] used the term ''historicism'' and reportedly termed it the single greatest threat to intellectual freedom insofar as it denies any attempt to address injustice-pure-and-simple (such is the significance of historicism's rejection of "natural right" or "right by nature").  Strauss argued that historicism "rejects political philosophy" (insofar as this stands or falls by questions of permanent, trans-historical significance) and is based on the belief that "all human thought, including scientific thought, rests on premises which cannot be validated by human reason and which came from historical epoch to historical epoch." Strauss further identified [[R. G. Collingwood]] as the most coherent advocate of historicism in the English language.  Countering Collingwood's arguments, Strauss warned against historicist social scientists' failure to address real-life problems—most notably that of tyranny—to the extent that they relativize (or "subjectivize") all ethical problems by placing their significance strictly in function of particular or ever-changing socio-material conditions devoid of inherent or "objective" "value." Similarly, Strauss criticized [[Eric Voegelin]]'s abandonment of ancient political thought as guide or vehicle in interpreting modern political problems.

In his books, ''[[Natural Right and History]]'' and ''[[On Tyranny]]'', Strauss offers a complete critique of historicism as it emerges in the works of Hegel, Marx, and [[Heidegger]]. Many believe that Strauss also found historicism in [[Edmund Burke]], [[Tocqueville]], [[Augustine]], and [[John Stuart Mill]]. Although it is largely disputed whether Strauss himself was a historicist, he often indicated that historicism grew out of and against Christianity and was a threat to civic participation, belief in human agency, religious pluralism, and, most controversially, an accurate understanding of the classical philosophers and religious prophets themselves. Throughout his work, he warns that historicism, and the understanding of [[Progress (history)|progress]] that results from it, expose us to [[tyranny]], totalitarianism, and [[Ochlocracy|democratic extremism]]. In his exchange with [[Alexandre Kojève]] in ''On Tyranny'', Strauss seems to blame historicism for [[Nazism]] and [[Communism]]. In a collection of his works by Kenneth Hart entitled ''[[Jewish Philosophy and the Crisis of Modernity]]'',  he argues that [[Islam]], traditional [[Judaism]], and ancient Greece, share a concern for sacred law that makes them especially susceptible to historicism, and therefore to tyranny.  Strauss makes use of Nietzsche's own critique of progress and historicism, although Strauss refers to Nietzsche himself (no less than to Heidegger) as a "radical historicist" who articulated a philosophical (if only untenable) justification for historicism.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10152">In [[evolutionary developmental biology]], '''homeosis''' is the transformation of one [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] into another, arising from [[mutation]] in or misexpression of certain developmentally critical [[gene]]s, specifically homeotic genes. In animals, these developmental genes specifically control the development of organs on their anteroposterior axis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Beyond homeosis—HOX function in morphogenesis and organogenesis|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1432-0436.2003.7108004.x/abstract|journal = Differentiation|date = 2003-10-01|issn = 1432-0436|pages = 461–476|volume = 71|issue = 8|doi = 10.1046/j.1432-0436.2003.7108004.x|first = James Castelli-Gair|last = Hombría|first2 = Bridget|last2 = Lovegrove}}&lt;/ref&gt; In plants, however, the developmental genes affected by homeosis may control anything from the development of a [[stamen]] or petals to the development of chlorophyll.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sattler|first=Rolf|date=October 1998|title=Homeosis in Plants|jstor=2444710|journal=American Journal of Botany|volume=75|pages=1606–1617|doi=10.2307/2444710|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Homeosis may be caused by mutations in [[Hox genes]], found in animals, or others such as the [[MADS-box]] family in plants. Homeosis is a characteristic that has helped [[insect]]s become as successful and diverse as they are.&lt;ref&gt;Lodish et al., 2003. ''Molecular Cell Biology, 5th Edition''. W.H. Freeman and Company, New York.{{Page needed|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homeotic mutations work by changing segment identity during development. For example, the ''[[Ultrabithorax]]'' [[genotype]] gives a [[phenotype]] wherein metathoracic and first [[abdominal]] segments become mesothoracic segments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/287795a0 |title=Mutations affecting segment number and polarity in [[Drosophila]] |year=1980 |last1=Nüsslein-Volhard |first1=Christiane |last2=Wieschaus |first2=Eric |journal=Nature |volume=287 |issue=5785 |pages=795–801 |pmid=6776413|bibcode=1980Natur.287..795N }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another well-known example is ''[[Antennapedia]]'': a [[gain-of-function]] [[allele]] causes legs to develop in the place of [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/325816a0 |title=Redesigning the body plan of [[Drosophila]] by ectopic expression of the homoeotic gene Antennapedia |year=1987 |last1=Schneuwly |first1=Stephan |last2=Klemenz |first2=Roman |last3=Gehring |first3=Walter J. |journal=Nature |volume=325 |issue=6107 |pages=816–818 |pmid=3821869|bibcode=1987Natur.325..816S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Plant morphology|botany]], [[Rolf Sattler]] has revised the concept of homeosis (replacement) by his emphasis on partial homeosis in addition to complete homeosis; this revision is now widely accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=2444710 |pages=1606–1617 |last1=Sattler |first1=R. |title=Homeosis in Plants |volume=75 |issue=10 |journal=American Journal of Botany |year=1988 |doi=10.2307/2444710}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homeotic mutants in [[angiosperms]] are thought to be rare in the wild: in the annual plant ''[[Clarkia]]'' ([[Onagraceae]]), homeotic mutants are known where the petals are replaced by a second whorl of sepal-like organs, originating via a mutation governed by a single recessive gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/358671a0 |title=Bicalyx is a natural homeotic floral variant |year=1992 |last1=Ford |first1=V. S. |last2=Gottlieb |first2=L. D. |journal=Nature |volume=358 |issue=6388 |pages=671–673|bibcode=1992Natur.358..671F }}&lt;/ref&gt; The absence of lethal or deleterious consequences in floral mutants resulting in distinct morphological expressions has been a factor in the evolution of Clarkia, and perhaps also in many other plant groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=2461245 |pages=681–709 |last1=Gottlieb |first1=L. D. |title=Genetics and Morphological Evolution in Plants |volume=123 |issue=5 |journal=The American Naturalist |year=1984 |doi=10.1086/284231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Homeotic mechanisms in animals==
Following the work on homeotic mutants by [[Edward B. Lewis|Ed Lewis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A gene complex controlling segmentation in [[Drosophila]] |year=1978 |last1=Lewis |first1=EB |journal=Nature |volume=276 |issue=5688 |pages=565–570 |pmid=103000 |doi=10.1038/276565a0|bibcode=1978Natur.276..565L }}&lt;/ref&gt; the phenomenology of homeosis in [[Metazoa|animals]] was further elaborated by discovery of a conserved DNA binding sequence present in many  homeotic proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A conserved DNA sequence in homoeotic genes of the [[Drosophila]] Antennapedia and bithorax complexes |year=1984 |last1=McGinnis |first1=W |last2=Levine |first2=MS |last3=Hafen |first3=E |last4=Kuroiwa |first4=A |last5=Gehring |first5=WJ  |journal=Nature |volume=308 |issue=5958 |pages=428–433 |pmid=6323992 |doi=10.1038/308428a0|bibcode=1984Natur.308..428M }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Thus, the 60 amino acid DNA binding protein domain was named the [[homeodomain]], while the 180 bp nucleotide sequence encoding it was named the [[homeobox]]. The homeobox gene clusters studied by Ed Lewis were named the [[Hox genes]], although it should be noted that many more homeobox genes are encoded by animal [[genome]]s than those in the Hox gene clusters.

The homeotic-function of certain proteins was first postulated to be that of a "selector" as proposed by [[Antonio Garcia-Bellido]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Genetic control of wing disc development in [[Drosophila]]. |year=1975 |last1=Garcia-Bellido |first1=A |journal=Ciba Found. Symp |volume=0 |pages=161–-182 |pmid=1039909}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
By definition selectors were imagined to be ([[transcription factor]]) proteins that stably determined one of two possible cell fates for a cell and its cellular descendants in a [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]].   
While most animal homeotic functions are associated with homeobox-containing factors, not all homeotic proteins in animals are encoded by homeobox genes, and further not all homeobox genes are necessarily associated with homeotic functions or ([[mutant]]) phenotypes.
The concept of homeotic selectors was further elaborated or at least qualified by [[Michael Akam]] in a so-called "post-selector gene" model that incorporated additional findings and "walked back" the "orthodoxy" of selector-dependent stable binary switches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Hox genes, homeosis and the evolution of segment identity: no need for hopeless monsters.|year=1998 |last1=Akam |first1=M |journal=International Journal of Developmental Biology |volume=42 | pages=445–451 |pmid=9654030}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of [[Compartment (development)|tissue compartments]] is deeply intertwined with the selector model of homeosis because the selector-mediated maintenance of cell fate can be restricted into different organizational units of an animal's [[body plan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Signals and mechanics shaping compartment boundaries in [[Drosophila]] |year=2015 |last1=Umetsu |first1=D |last2=Dahmann |first2=C |journal=Wiley Interdiscip Rev Dev Biol |volume=4 |pages=407–417 |pmid=25755098 |doi=10.1002/wdev.178}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In this context, newer insights into homeotic mechanisms were found by [[Albert Erives]] and colleagues by focusing on [[Enhancer (genetics)|enhancer DNAs]] that are co-targeted by homeotic selectors and different combinations of developmental signals.&lt;ref name=Stroebele/&gt;
This work identifies a protein biochemical difference between the [[transcription factor]]s that function as homeotic selectors versus the [[transcription factor]]s that function as effectors of developmental signaling pathways, such as the [[Notch signaling pathway]] and the [[Transforming growth factor beta superfamily|BMP signaling pathway]].&lt;ref name="Stroebele"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Integration of Orthogonal Signaling by the Notch and Dpp Pathways in Drosophila |year=2016 |last1=Stroebele |first1=E |last2=Erives |first2=A |journal=Genetics |volume=203 |pages=219–240 |pmid=26975664 |doi=10.1534/genetics.116.186791 |pmc=4858776}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This work proposes that homeotic selectors function to "license" [[Enhancer (genetics)|enhancer DNAs]] in a restricted [[Compartment (development)|tissue compartment]] so that the enhancers are enabled to read-out developmental signals, which are then integrated via [[Polyglutamine tract|polyglutamine]]-mediated aggregation.&lt;ref name=Stroebele/&gt;

==Homeotic mechanisms in plants==
Like the complex [[Multicellular organism|multicellularity]] seen in [[animals]], the multicellularity of [[land plants]] is developmentally organized into [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] and [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]] units via [[transcription factor]] genes with homeotic effects.&lt;ref name="Sablowski"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Control of patterning, growth, and differentiation by floral organ identity genes. |year=2015 |last1=Sablowski |first1=R |journal=Journal of Experimental Botany |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=1065–1073 |pmid=25609826 |doi=10.1093/jxb/eru514}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although plants have homeobox-containing genes, plant homeotic factors tend to possess [[MADS-box]] DNA binding domains.
Animal genomes also possess a small number [[MADS-box]] factors.
Thus, in the independent evolution of [[Multicellular organism|multicellularity]] in plants and animals, different [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] transcription factor families were [[Exaptation|co-opted]] to serve homeotic functions. 
MADS-domain factors have been proposed to function as co-factors to more specialized factors and thereby help to determine organ identity.&lt;ref name=Sablowski/&gt;
This has been proposed to correspond more closely to the interpretation of animal homeotics outlined by [[Michael Akam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Hox genes: From master genes to micromanagers |year=1998 |last1=Akam |first1=M |journal=Current Biology |volume=8 |pages=R676 |pmid=9768351 |doi=10.1016/s0960-9822(98)70433-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Humanistic naturalism''' is the branch of [[philosophical naturalism]] wherein [[human beings]] are best able to control and understand the world through use of the [[scientific method]], combined with the social and ethical values of [[humanism]]. Concepts of spirituality, intuition, and [[metaphysics]] are considered [[subjectivity|subjectively]] valuable only, primarily because they are unfalsifiable, and therefore can never progress beyond the realm of personal opinion. A boundary is not drawn between [[nature]] and what lies "beyond" nature; everything is regarded as a result of explainable processes within nature, with nothing lying outside it.&lt;ref&gt;'' Living Issues in Philosophy'' (4th ed.; New York: American Book Co., 1963): 215-221.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The belief is that all living things are intricate extensions of nature, and therefore deserve some degree of mutual respect from human beings. Naturalists accept the need for adaptation to current change, however it may be, and also that life must feed upon life for survival. However, they also recognize the necessity for a fair exchange of resources between all species. Humanistic naturalists are generally concerned with the ethical aspects of "worldview naturalism."&lt;ref&gt;''What is Humanism'' (American Humanist Association)&lt;/ref&gt;
 	
Industry and technology are sometimes regarded as enemies to naturalism, but this is not always the case. For those who do believe in such threats, the thought is that the majority of human history, societies were largely agricultural and [[hunter-gatherer]] and lived in relative harmony and balance with nature. With the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, some humanistic naturalists see this balance as being increasingly threatened. This view has some similarities with [[anarcho-primitivism]] and other anti-modernist perspectives.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6828">'''Interlocus contest evolution''' (ICE) is a process of intergenomic conflict by which different [[locus (genetics)|loci]] within a single [[genome]] antagonistically [[coevolution|coevolve]]. ICE supposes that the [[Red Queen hypothesis|Red Queen process]], which is characterized by a never-ending antagonistic [[evolutionary arms race]], does not only apply to [[species]] but also to [[gene]]s within the genome of a species.&lt;ref name="Rice_Holland_1997"&gt;Rice &amp; Holland, 1997. "[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Brett_Holland/publication/227329481_The_enemies_within_Intergenomic_conflict_interlocus_contest_evolution_ICE_and_the_intraspecific_Red_Queen/links/0c960520406849c122000000.pdf The enemies within: intergenomic conflict, interlocus contest evolution (ICE), and the intraspecific Red Queen]." Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology 41(1): 1-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because [[genetic recombination|sexual recombination]] allows different gene loci to evolve semi-autonomously, genes have the potential to coevolve antagonistically. ICE occurs when "an allelic substitution at one locus selects for a new allele at the interacting locus, and vice versa." As a result, ICE can lead to a chain reaction of perpetual gene substitution at antagonistically interacting loci, and no stable equilibrium can be achieved. The rate of evolution thus increases at that locus.&lt;ref name="Rice_Holland_1997"/&gt;

ICE is thought to be the dominant mode of evolution for genes controlling social behavior.&lt;ref name="Rice_Holland_1997"/&gt; The ICE process can explain many biological phenomena, including intersexual conflict, [[parent offspring conflict]], and interference competition.

==Intersexual conflict==
{{main|Interlocus sexual conflict}}
A fundamental conflict between the sexes lies in differences in investment: males generally invest predominantly in fertilization while females invest predominantly in offspring.&lt;ref&gt;Bateman, AJ. 1948. “[http://www2.nau.edu/~shuster/shustercourses/BIO%20698/Literature/Bateman1948.pdf Intra-sexual selection in Drosophila].” Heredity 2: 349-368.&lt;/ref&gt; This conflict manifests itself in many traits associated with [[sexual reproduction]]. Genes expressed in only one sex are selectively neutral in the other sex; male- and female-linked genes can therefore be acted upon separated by selection and will evolve semi-autonomously.&lt;ref name="Rice_Holland_1997"/&gt; Thus, one sex of a species may evolve to better itself rather than better the species as a whole, sometimes with negative results for the opposite sex: loci will antagonistically coevolve to enhance male reproductive success at females’ expense on the one hand, and to enhance female resistance to male coercion on the other.&lt;ref&gt;Trivers, R.L. 1972. "[http://www1.appstate.edu/~kms/classes/psy2664/Documents/trivers.pdf Parental investment and sexual selection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304025739/http://www1.appstate.edu/~kms/classes/psy2664/Documents/trivers.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}." Sexual Selection and the Descent of Man, 1871–1971. Campbell, Aldine Publishing. 136–179.&lt;/ref&gt; This is an example of [[intralocus sexual conflict]], and is unlikely to be resolved fully throughout the genome. However, in some cases this conflict may be resolved by the restriction of the gene’s expression to only the sex that it benefits, resulting in [[sexual dimorphism]].&lt;ref&gt;Bonduriansky, R, SF Chenoweth. 2009. "Intralocus sexual conflict." Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution 24(5): 280-288.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICE theory can explain the differentiation of the human [[X chromosome|X-]] and [[Y chromosome|Y-chromosomes]]. Semi-autonomous evolution may have promoted genes beneficial to females in the X-chromosome even when detrimental to males, and genes beneficial to males in the Y-chromosome, even when detrimental to females. As the distribution of the X-chromosome is three times as large as the Y-chromosome (the X-chromosome occurs in 3/4 of offspring genes, while the Y-chromosome occurs in only 1/4), the Y-chromosome has a reduced opportunity for rapid evolution. Thus the Y-chromosome has "shed" its genes to leave only the essential ones (such as the [[Testis determining factor|SRY gene]]), which gives rise to the differences in the X- and Y-chromosomes.&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, M. 2000. Genome: The Autobiography of a Species in 23 Chapters. Harper and Collins.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parent–offspring conflict==
A father, mother and offspring may differ in the optimal resource allocation to the offspring. This co-evolutionary conflict can be considered in the context of ICE. Selection will favor genes in the male to maximize female investment in the current offspring, no matter the consequences to the female's reproduction later in life, while selection will favor genes in the female that increase her overall lifetime [[fitness (biology)|fitness]]. Genes expressed in the offspring will be selected to produce an intermediary level of resource allocation between the male-benefit and female-benefit loci. This three-way conflict again occurs when parents feed their offspring, as the optimum feeding rate and optimum point in time to discontinue feeding differ between father, mother and offspring.&lt;ref name="Rice_Holland_1997"/&gt;

==Interference competition==
ICE can also explain the theory of [[interference competition]], which is most likely to be associated with opposing sets of genes that determine the outcome of [[competition]] between individuals. Different sets of genes may code for signal or receiver [[phenotype]]s, such as in the context of [[Deimatic behavior|threat displays]]: when a competing male can win more contests by intimidation, rather than by fighting, selection will favor the accumulation of deceitful genes that may not be honest indicators of the male’s fighting capability.&lt;ref name="Rice_Holland_1997"/&gt;

For example, primitive male [[elephant seal]]s may have used the lowest frequencies in the threat call of a rival as an indication of body size. The elephant seal's enormous nose may have evolved as a resonating device to amplify low frequencies,&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomew, GA, NE Collias. 1962. "The role of vocalization in the social behaviour of the northern elephant seal." Animal Behaviour 10(1): 7-14.&lt;/ref&gt; illustrating selection that favors the production of low-frequency threat vocalizations. However, this counter-selects for receptor systems that provide an increased threshold required for intimidation, which in turn selects for deeper threat vocalizations. The rapid divergence of threat displays among closely related species provides further evidence in support of the co-evolutionary arms race within the genome of a single species, driven by the ICE process.&lt;ref name="Rice_Holland_1997"/&gt;

[[File:Flint-knapping Demonstration (27349458154).jpg|thumb|Flintknapping a stone tool]]
'''Knapping''' is the shaping of [[flint]], [[chert]], [[obsidian]] or other [[conchoidal fracture|conchoidal fracturing]] stone through the process of [[lithic reduction]] to manufacture [[stone tool]]s, strikers for [[flintlock]] firearms, or to produce flat-faced stones for building or facing walls, and [[flushwork]] decoration. The original Germanic term "knopp" meant strike, shape, or work, so it could theoretically have referred equally well to making a statue or dice. Modern usage is more specific, referring almost exclusively to the hand-tool pressure-flaking process pictured.

== Method ==
{{main article|Lithic reduction}}
[[File:Knapping.JPG|thumb|upright|A leather leg guard protects the knapper from being injured by the edges of the flint]]
Flintknapping or knapping is done in a variety of ways depending on the purpose of the final product. For stone tools and flintlock strikers, chert is worked using a fabricator such as a [[hammerstone]] to remove [[lithic flake]]s from a nucleus or [[lithic core|core]] of [[tool stone]]. Stone tools can then be further refined using wood, bone, and antler tools to perform [[pressure flaking]].

For building work a hammer or pick is used to split chert nodules supported on the lap. Often the chert nodule will be split in half to create two cherts with a flat circular face for use in walls constructed of lime. More sophisticated knapping is employed to produce near-perfect cubes which are used as bricks.

=== Tools ===
There are many different methods of shaping stone into useful tools. Early knappers could have used simple hammers made of wood or antler to shape stone tools. The factors that contribute to the knapping results are varied, but the EPA (exterior platform angle) indeed influences many attributes, such as length, thickness and termination of flakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dibble|first1=Harold|last2=Whittaker|first2=John|title=New Experimental Evidence on the Relation Between Percussion Flaking and Flake Variation|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|date=1981|volume=8|pages=283–296|doi=10.1016/0305-4403(81)90004-2|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0305440381900042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hard hammer'' techniques are used to remove large flakes of stone. Early knappers and hobbyists replicating their methods often use cobbles of very hard stone, such as quartzite. This technique can be used by flintknappers to remove broad flakes that can be made into smaller tools. This method of manufacture is believed to have been used to make some of the earliest stone tools ever found, some of which date from over 2 million years ago.
[[File:Soft Hammer.jpg|thumb|left|Soft hammer knapping]]
''Soft hammer'' techniques are more precise than hard hammer methods of shaping stone. Soft hammer techniques allow a knapper to shape a stone into many different kinds of cutting, scraping, and projectile tools. These "soft hammer" techniques also produce longer, thinner flakes, potentially allowing for material conservation or a lighter lithic tool kit to be carried by mobile societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peclin|first1=Andrew|title=The Effect of Indentor Type on Flake Attributes: Evidence from a Controlled Experiment|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|date=1997|volume=24|pages=613–621|doi=10.1006/jasc.1996.0145|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440396901454#}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pressure flaking'' involves removing narrow flakes along the edge of a stone tool. This technique is often used to do detailed thinning and shaping of a stone tool. Pressure flaking involves putting a large amount of force across a region on the edge of the tool and (hopefully) causing a narrow flake to come off of the stone. Modern hobbyists often use pressure flaking tools with a copper or brass tip, but early knappers could have used antler tines or a pointed wooden punch; traditionalist knappers still use antler tines and copper-tipped tools. The major advantage of using soft metals rather than wood or bone is that the metal punches wear down less and are less likely to break under pressure.

== Uses ==

[[File:Steinschloss.jpg|thumb|right|A gun-flint mounted in the jaws of a flintlock musket]]
In cultures that have not adopted metalworking technologies, the production of stone tools by knappers is common, but in modern cultures the making of such tools is the domain of [[experimental archaeology|experimental archaeologists]] and hobbyists. [[Archaeologist]]s usually undertake the task so that they can better understand how prehistoric [[stone tool]]s were made.

Knapping is often learned by outdoorsmen.

Knapping ''gun flints'', used by [[Flintlock mechanism|flintlock firearms]] was formerly a major industry in flint bearing locations, such as [[Brandon, Suffolk|Brandon]] in [[Suffolk]], England and the small towns of [[Meusnes]] and [[Couffy]] in France.&lt;ref name="ancientcrafts" /&gt; Meusnes has a small museum dedicated to the industry.

In 1804, during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Brandon was supplying over 400,000 flints a month for use by the British Army and Navy.&lt;ref name="whittaker"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://web.grinnell.edu/anthropology/Faculty/JohnWhittaker/Articles/2001_The_Oldest_British.pdf | title=The Oldest British Industry: continuity and obsolescence in a flintknapper's sample set | author=Whittaker, John | journal=Antiquity | year=2001 | volume=75 | pages=382–90 | doi=10.1017/s0003598x00061032}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brandon knappers made gun flints for export to Africa as late as the 1960s.

Knapping for building purposes is still a skill that is practiced in the flint-bearing regions of southern England, such as [[Sussex]], Suffolk and [[Norfolk]], and in northern France, especially [[Brittany]] and [[Normandy]], where there is a resurgence of the craft due to government funding.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.flintknapping.co.uk/arch.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health hazards==
Historically, flint knappers commonly suffered from [[silicosis]], due to the inhalation of flint dust. This has been called "the world's first [[Occupational disease|industrial disease]]".&lt;ref name="ancientcrafts"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ancientcraft.co.uk/Flintknapping/Flintknapping.html#Health | title=Basic Tool Production Techniques, Health and Safety| publisher=ancientcrafts.co.uk | accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pugetsound"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pugetsoundknappers.com/interesting_stuff/knapping_silicosis_article.html | title=FLlNTKNAPPING AND SILICOSIS | publisher=Pudget Sound Knappers | date=2010 | accessdate=24 August 2015 | author=Kalin, Jeffery}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When gun flint knapping was a large-scale industry in Brandon, silicosis was widely known as ''knappers' rot''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Knapper's Rot, Silicosis in East Anglian Flint Knappers | author=Batty Shaw, A | journal=Medical History | year=1981 | volume=25 | pages=151–168 | doi=10.1017/s0025727300034359 | pmid=7012479 | pmc=1139012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been claimed silicosis was responsible for the early death of three-quarters of Brandon gun flint makers. In one workshop, seven of the eight workmen died of the condition before the age of fifty.&lt;ref name="ancientcrafts" /&gt;

Modern knappers are advised to work in the open air to reduce the dust hazard, and to wear eye and hand protection.&lt;ref name="ancientcrafts" /&gt; Some modern knappers wear a [[respirator]] to guard against dust.&lt;ref name="pugetsound" /&gt;

== Contemporary study ==
[[File:Enseñando a tallar.jpg|thumb|150px|right|French prehistorian [[Jacques Tixier]] offers modern training in stone knapping.]] 
Modern American interest in knapping can be traced back &lt;ref&gt;Whittaker 1994:56-58&lt;/ref&gt; to the study of a [[California]] Native American called [[Ishi]] who lived in the early twentieth century. Ishi taught scholars and academics traditional methods of making stone tools and how to use them for survival in the wild. Early European explorers to the New world were also exposed to flint knapping techniques. Additionally, several pioneering nineteenth-century European experimental knappers are also known and in the late 1960s and early 1970s experimental archaeologist [[Don Crabtree]] published texts such as "Experiments in Flintworking". [[François Bordes]] was an early writer on [[Old World]] knapping; he experimented with ways to replicate stone tools found across [[Western Europe]]. These authors helped to ignite a small craze in knapping among archaeologists and prehistorians.

English archaeologist [[Phil Harding (archaeologist)|Phil Harding]] is another contemporary expert, whose exposure on the television series [[Time Team]] has led to him being a familiar figure in the UK and beyond. Many groups, with members from all walks of life, can now be found across the United States and Europe. These organizations continue to demonstrate and teach various ways of shaping stone tools.

Margham also has an oil production capability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gulfnews.com/business/oil-in-dubai-history-timeline-1.578333|title=Oil in Dubai: History &amp; timeline|last=archives|first=Gulf News|date=2010-02-04|work=GulfNews|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Production at Margham commenced in 1984, with three major gas-bearing formations located up to 10,000 feet below sea level. The field is connected by pipeline to Jebel Ali, where the gas condensate is loaded onto tankers for export. Dry gas is now also sent by pipeline to supply the Dubai grid, with consumption increasing since 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.icis.com/resources/news/2018/01/10/10181701/uae-bets-on-alternative-energy-local-gas-production/|title=UAE bets on alternative energy, local gas production|access-date=2018-09-09|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Margham was initially developed as a liquids stripping/gas recycling project (dry gas was pumped back into the reservoir),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.woodmac.com/reports/upstream-oil-and-gas-margham-field-gas-storage-project-1770930|title=Margham Field Gas Storage Project|access-date=2018-09-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; but now operates as a gas storage facility for Dubai since 2008, allowing Dubai to depend on gas produced from Margham for its elecricity generation and desalination needs. This usage, together with sustainables such as DEWA's [[Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park]], means that Dubai has eliminated the use of oil as a domestic energy fuel.

Although it is a major producer with ambitions to develop its trading activities to become a major global LNG hub, the UAE is actually a net importer of LNG.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenational.ae/business/dubai-supply-authority-agrees-deal-with-japan-s-jera-to-explore-lng-opportunities-1.19125|title=Dubai Supply Authority agrees deal with Japan’s Jera to explore LNG opportunities|work=The National|access-date=2018-09-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5407">'''Meteorological intelligence''' is [[information]] measured, gathered, compiled, exploited, analyzed and disseminated by [[Meteorology|meteorologists]], [[Climatology|climatologists]] and [[Hydrology|hydrologists]] to characterize the current state and/or predict the future state of the [[atmosphere]] at a given location and time.  Meteorological intelligence is a subset of [[environmental intelligence]] and is synonymous with the term [[weather intelligence]].  

The earliest known use of the term "meteorological intelligence" in a written document dates to 1854 on pg. 168 of the Eighth Annual Report of the Board of Regents of the [[Smithsonian Institution]].  This report discusses the Smithsonian Institution's initiative to transmit meteorological intelligence via [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] lines.  An early reference to "meteorological intelligence" in England dates an 1866 issue of [[Edinburgh Review|The Edinburgh Review]] which was a prominent [[Scottish people|Scottish]] journal during the 19th century (Reeve 1866, pg. 75).  

Another documented, early use of the term dates to 1874 in a historical compilation entitled, "The American Historical Record" (Lossing 1874, pg. 125).  In this book, Lossing uses the term to refer to weather observations transmitted over telegraph lines for the purpose of studying the nature of [[storm]]s with the ultimate goal of enhancing public safety through the issuance of storm warnings.  This mission was carried out by the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Army Signal Service]] starting in the 1870s who was responsible for communication (via telegraph) of technical [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] for the army as well as "meteorological intelligence" for the general welfare of the country (Ingersoll 1879, pg. 156).

From the viewpoint of the [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence community]], the term meteorological intelligence is more limited in its use referring to the use of [[Clandestine operation|clandestine]] or technical means to learn about environmental conditions over enemy territory (Shulsky and Schmitt 2002) as in the [[North Atlantic weather war]]. In the [[military intelligence]] context, weather information is often referred to as meteorological or environmental intelligence (Hinsley 1990, pg. 420; Platt 1957, pg. 14; U.S. Congress, pg. 164). 

With regard to private sector [[meteorology]], the term meteorological intelligence is a broad term of art that is primarily associated with observed and forecast weather information provided to decision makers in one of a number of weather sensitive business areas including: Energy, [[forestry]], [[agriculture]], [[telecommunication]]s, [[transport]]ation, [[aviation]], [[entertainment]], [[Retailing|retail]] and [[construction]] (CMOS 2001, pg. 23) .  It is considered a key aspect of [[weather risk management]] for the legal and [[insurance]] industries.

A '''natural landscape''' is the original landscape that exists before it is acted upon by human culture.&lt;ref group = note&gt;"The area prior to the introduction of man 's activity is represented by one body of morphologic facts. The forms that man has introduced are another set. We may call the former, with reference to man, the original, natural landscape. In its entirety it no longer exists in many parts of the world, but its reconstruction and understanding are the first part of formal morphonology." Carl O. Sauer, "The Morphology of Landscape". ''University of California Publications in Geography'', vol. 2, No. 2, 12 October 1925, p. 37.[https://archive.org/stream/universityofc02univ/universityofc02univ_djvu.txt]&lt;/ref&gt; The natural landscape and the [[cultural landscape]] are separate parts of the [[landscape]].&lt;ref group = note&gt;"The cultural landscape is fashioned from a natural landscape by a culture group. Culture is the agent, the natural area is the medium, the cultural landscape the result." Carl O. Sauer, "The Morphology of Landscape", p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the twenty-first century landscapes that are totally untouched by human activity no longer exist, so that reference is sometimes now made to degrees of naturalness within a landscape.&lt;ref group = note&gt;The [[European Environment Agency]]'s planned forest naturalness index is an example of an attempt to define one type of natural landscape in Europe. The Agency lists forests in three categories: (1) [[Plantations]]; (2) Semi-natural; and (3) Naturally dynamic. The latter are "forests whose structure, composition and function have been shaped by natural dynamics without substantial [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] influence over a long period of time".&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Silent Spring]]'' (1962) [[Rachel Carson]] describes a roadside verge as it used to look: "Along the roads, laurel, viburnum and alder, great ferns and wildflowers delighted the traveler’s eye through much of the year" and then how it looks now following the use of [[herbicide]]s: "The roadsides, once so attractive, were now lined with browned and withered vegetation as though swept by fire".&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge, Mass.: Riverside Press, 1962, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the landscape before it is sprayed is biologically degraded, and may well contains alien species, the concept of what might constitute a natural landscape can still be deduced from the context.

The phrase "natural landscape" was first used in connection with [[landscape painting]], and [[landscape gardening]], to contrast a formal style with a more natural one, closer to nature. [[Alexander von Humboldt]] (1769 – 1859) was to further conceptualize this into the idea of a natural landscape ''separate'' from the [[cultural landscape]]. Then in 1908 [[geographer]] [[Otto Schlüter]] developed the terms original landscape (''Urlandschaft'') and its opposite cultural landscape (''Kulturlandschaft'') in an attempt to give the science of geography a subject matter that was different from the other sciences. An early use of the actual phrase "natural landscape" by a [[geographer]] can be found in  [[Carl O. Sauer]]'s paper "The Morphology of Landscape" (1925).&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl O. Sauer]], "The Morphology of Landscape". ''University of California Publications in Geography'' 2 (2), pp. 19-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the term==
The concept of a natural landscape was first developed in connection with [[landscape painting]], though the actual term itself was first used in relation to [[landscape gardening]]. In both cases it was used to contrast a formal style with a more natural one, that is closer to nature. Chunglin Kwa suggests, "that a seventeenth-century or early-eighteenth-century person could experience natural scenery ‘just like on a painting,’ and so, with or without the use of the word itself, designate it as a landscape."&lt;ref&gt;Chunglin Kwa, "Alexander von Humboldt's invention of the natural landscape", ''The European Legacy'', Vol. 10, No. 2, pp. 149-162, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to landscape gardening John Aikin, commented in 1794: "Whatever, therefore, there be of ''novelty'' in the singular scenery of an artificial garden, it is soon exhausted, whereas the infinite diversity of a natural landscape presents an inexhaustible flore of new forms".&lt;ref&gt;J. Aikin, M.D., ''Letters from a Father to His Son, on Various Topics, Relative to Literature and the Conduct of Life. Written in the Years 1792 and 1793'',  (Philadelphia:  Samuel Harrison Smith), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 1844 the prominent American landscape gardener [[Andrew Jackson Downing]] comments: "straight canals, round or oblong pieces of water, and all the regular forms of the geometric mode ... would evidently be in violent opposition to the whole character and expression of natural landscape".&lt;ref&gt;''A Treatise on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening Adapted to North America''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his extensive travels in South America, [[Alexander von Humboldt]] became the first to conceptualize a natural landscape separate from the cultural landscape, though he does not actually use these terms.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/qnct310.txt&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/cele/2005/00000010/00000002/art00002 Chunglin Kwa, Alexander von Humboldt's invention of the natural landscape, The European Legacy, Vol. 10, No. 2, pp. 149-162, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group = note&gt;[http://www.avhumboldt.net/humboldt/publications/paragraph/did/35/vid/38/cid/244/tid/7698/text/The-description-of-nature-in-its-manifold-richness-of-form-as-a-distinct-branch-of-poetic-literat] "The description of nature in its manifold richness of form, as a distinct branch of poetic literature, was wholly unknown to the Greeks. The landscape appears among them merely as the basil-ground of the picture of which human figures constitute the main subject. Passions, breaking forth into action, riveted their attention almost exclusively." Alexander von Humboldt ''[[Cosmos: a sketch of a physical description of the universe]]'' (translation 1804), Volume 2, Part I, Paragraph 5, Chapter I.&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Jackson Downing was aware of, and sympathetic to, Humboldt's ideas, which therefore influenced American landscape gardening.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Horticulturist'', vol.4, no.2, August 1849, which Downing edited.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, the [[geographer]] [[Otto Schlüter]], in 1908, argued that by defining [[geography]] as a ''Landschaftskunde'' (landscape science) would give geography a logical subject matter shared by no other discipline.&lt;ref&gt;James, P.E &amp; Martin, G (1981) ''All Possible Worlds: A History of Geographical Ideas.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons. New York, p.177.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, T.H (1989) ''Human and Regional Geography in the German-speaking lands in the first forty years of the Twentieth Century''. Entriken, J. Nicholas &amp; Brunn, Stanley D (Eds) ''Reflections on Richard Hartshorne's The nature of geography''. Occasional publications of the Association of the American Geographers, Washington DC., p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; He defined two forms of landscape: the ''Urlandschaft'' (original landscape) or landscape that existed before major human induced changes and the ''Kulturlandschaft'' (cultural landscape) a landscape created by human culture. Schlüter argued that the major task of geography was to trace the changes in these two landscapes.

The term natural landscape is sometimes used as a synonym for [[wilderness]], but for geographers natural landscape is a scientific term which refers to the [[biological]], [[geological]], [[Climatology|climatological]] and other aspects of a landscape, not the cultural values that are implied by the word wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;"The Trouble with Wilderness; or, Getting Back to the Wrong Nature". William Cronon, ed., ''Uncommon Ground: Rethinking the Human Place in Nature''. (New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., 1995), pp. 69–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The natural and conservation===
Matters are complicated by the fact that the words nature and natural have more than one meaning. On the one hand there is the main dictionary meaning for nature: "The phenomena of the physical world collectively, including plants, animals, the landscape, and other features and products of the earth, as opposed to humans or human creations".&lt;ref&gt;"Nature", ''New Oxford American Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, there is the growing awareness, especially since [[Charles Darwin]], of humanities biological affinity with nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://education.seattlepi.com/animals-share-human-dna-sequences-6693.html "Animals That Share Human DNA Sequences", Seattlepi.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] of the first definition has its roots is an "ancient concept", because early people viewed "nature, or the nonhuman world […] as a divine ''Other'', godlike in its separation from humans".&lt;ref&gt;Gregory H. Aplett and David N. Cole, "The Trouble with Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Goals" in ''Beyond Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Stewardshio in an Era of Rapid Change'' (Washington, DC.: Island Press, 2010), p. 14. They cite William Conron's 1995 essay "The Trouble with Wilderness: or, Getting Back to the Wrong Nature".&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Western culture|West]], Christianity's myth of [[The fall of man|the fall]], that is the expulsion of humankind from the [[Garden of Eden]], where all creation lived in harmony, into an imperfect world, has been the major influence.&lt;ref&gt;Joanne Vining, Melinda Merrick and Emily Price, "The Distinction between Humans and Nature". ''Human Ecology Review'', vol.15, no. 1, 2008, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cartesian dualism]], from the seventeenth century on,  further reinforced this dualistic thinking about nature.&lt;ref&gt;Vining, Merrick and Price, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; 
With this [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] goes value judgement as to [[appeal to nature|the superiority of the natural over the artificial]]. Modern science, however, is moving towards a [[holistic]] view of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Kaika, ''City of Flows: Modernity, Nature, and the City''. (New York: Routledge, 2005), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

====America====
What is meant by natural, within the American [[conservation movement]], has been changing over the last century and a half.

In the mid-nineteenth century American began to realize that the land was becoming more and more domesticated and wildlife was disappearing. This led to the creation of [[National Park Service|American National Parks]] and other conservation sites.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory H. Aplett and David N. Cole, "The Trouble with Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Goals" in ''Beyond Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Stewardshio in an Era of Rapid Change'' (Washington, DC.: Island Press, 2010), pp. 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially it was believed that all that was needed to do was to separate what was seen as natural landscape and "avoid disturbances such as logging, grazing, fire and insect outbreaks".&lt;ref name="Aplett and Cole, p. 15"&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; This, and subsequent environmental policy, until recently, was influenced by ideas of the wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;William Cronon, pp. 72-77&lt;/ref&gt; However, this policy was not consistently applied, and in [[Yellowstone Park]], to take one example, the existing ecology was altered, firstly by the exclusion of Native Americans and later with the virtual extermination of the wolf population.&lt;ref name="dow"&gt;{{cite web |title=Defenders of Wildlife |work=A Yellowstone Chronology |url=http://www.defenders.org/wildlife/wolf/ynpchro.html |accessdate=2007-03-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607214843/http://www.defenders.org/wildlife/wolf/ynpchro.html |archivedate=7 June 2007}}&lt;/ref{{cite book |last=Merchant |first=Carolyn |title=The Columbia Guide to American Environmental History |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-231-11232-1 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=QQQximQsxSgC |page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A century later, in the mid-twentieth century, it began to be believed that the earlier policy of "protection from disturbance was inadequate to preserve park values", and that is that direct human intervention was necessary to restore the landscape of National Parks to its ‘’natural’’ condition.&lt;ref name="Aplett and Cole, p. 15"/&gt; In 1963 the [[Leopold Report]] argued that "A national park should represent a vignette of primitive America".&lt;ref&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; This policy change eventually led to the restoration of [[History of wolves in Yellowstone|wolves in Yellowstone Park]] in the 1990s.

However, recent research in various disciplines indicates that a pristine natural or "primitive" landscape is a myth, and it now realised that people have been changing the natural into a cultural landscape for a long while, and that there are few places untouched in some way from human influence.&lt;ref&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; The earlier conservation policies were now seen as cultural interventions. The idea of what is natural and what artificial or cultural, and how to maintain the natural elements in a landscape, has been further complicated by the discovery of [[global warming]] and how it is changing natural landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Also important is a reaction recently amongst scholars against dualistic thinking about nature and culture. Maria Kaika comments: "Nowadays, we are beginning to see nature and culture as intertwined once again – not [[ontologically]] separated anymore […].What I used to perceive as a compartmentalized world, consisting of neatly and tightly sealed, autonomous ‘space envelopes’ (the home, the city, and nature) was, in fact, a messy socio-spatial continuum”.&lt;ref&gt;''City of Flows: Modernity, Nature, and the City''. (New York: Routledge, 2005), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; And William Cronon argues against the idea of wilderness because it "involves a dualistic vision in which the human is entirely outside the natural"&lt;ref&gt;Cronon, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; and affirms that "wildness (as opposed to wilderness) can be found anywhere" even "in the cracks of a Manhattan sidewalk".&lt;ref name="Cronon, p. 85"&gt;Cronon, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cronon we have to "abandon the dualism that sees the tree in the garden as artificial […] and the tree in the wilderness as natural […] Both in some ultimate sense are wild."&lt;ref name="Cronon, p. 85"/&gt; Here he bends somewhat the regular dictionary meaning of wild, to emphasise that nothing natural, even in a garden, is fully under human control.

====Europe====
The landscape of Europe has considerably altered by people and even in an area, like the [[Cairngorm Mountains]] of [[Scotland]], with a low population density, only " the high summits of the [[Cairngorm Mountains]], consist entirely of natural elements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snh.gov.uk/about-scotlands-nature/scotlands-landscapes/what-is-landscape/  [[Scottish Natural Heritage]], ]&lt;/ref&gt; These ''high summits'' are of course only part of the Cairngorms, and there are no longer wolves, bears, wild boar or lynx in Scotland's wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;Murray (1973)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/north_east/6155172.stm | title = Extinct Island Pig Spotted Again | publisher = BBC News | date = 17 November 2006 | accessdate =1 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fraser Darling and Boyd 1969 64"&gt;Fraser Darling and Boyd (1969) p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Scots pine]] in the form of the [[Caledonian forest]] also covered much more of the Scottish landscape than today.&lt;ref&gt;Steven, H. M. &amp; Carlisle, A. (1959). ''The Native Pinewoods of Scotland''. Oliver and Boyd, Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Swiss National Park]], however, represent a more natural landscape. It was founded in 1914, and is one of the earliest national parks in Europe.
Visitors are not allowed to leave the motor road, or paths through the park, make fire or camp. The only building within the park is Chamanna Cluozza, [[mountain hut]]. It is also forbidden to disturb the animals or the plants, or to take home anything found in the park. Dogs are not allowed. Due to these strict rules, the Swiss National Park is the only park in the Alps who has been categorized by the [[IUCN]] as a [[strict nature reserve]], which is the highest protection level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/mabdb/br/brdir/directory/biores.asp?code=SWI+01&amp;mode=all Parc Suisse Biosphere Reserve]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of natural landscape==
No place on the Earth is unaffected by people and their culture. People are part of [[biodiversity]], but human activity affects biodiversity, and this alters the natural landscape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnh.org/museum/press/feature/biofact.html National Survey Reveals Biodiversity Crisis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607101209/http://www.amnh.org/museum/press/feature/biofact.html |date=7 June 2007 }} American Museum of Natural History&lt;/ref&gt; Mankind have altered landscape to such an extent that few places on earth remain pristine, but once free of human influences, the landscape can return to a natural or near natural state.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4uDb0H4V5c YouTube, Professor James Lovelock, We can't save the planet, BBC NEWS, 2010/03/30]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wrangell St. Elias National Park.jpg|thumb| [[Glacier]] on the border between [[Alaska]], US, and Canada: [[Kluane-Wrangell-St. Elias-Glacier Bay-Tatshenshini-Alsek]] park system]]
Even the remote [[Yukon]] and [[Alaskan]] wilderness, the bi-national [[Kluane-Wrangell-St. Elias-Glacier Bay-Tatshenshini-Alsek]] park system comprising [[Kluane National Park|Kluane]], [[Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve|Wrangell-St Elias]], [[Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve|Glacier Bay]] and [[Tatshenshini-Alsek Park|Tatshenshini-Alsek]] parks, a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]], is not free from human influence, because the [[Kluane National Park]] lies within the traditional territories of the Champagne and Aishihik [[First Nations]] and [[Kluane First Nation]] who have a long history of living in this region. Through their respective Final Agreements with the Canadian Government, they have made into law their rights to harvest in this region.

==Examples of cultural forces==
Cultural forces intentionally or unintentionally, have an influence upon the landscape.&lt;ref group = note&gt;[http://lamar.colostate.edu/%7Ehrolston/Technol-vs-Nature-Aberdeen.pdf "It is true that certain human technological actions do have unintended consequences that spread everywhere; there are contagious effects that seep into the nooks and crannies of all nature." Holmes Rolston III, "Technology versus nature, What is natural, Journal of Philosophy and Technology", ''Ends and Means'', Vol 2 No.2 Spring 1998, University of Aberdeen, Edinburgh University Press]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cultural landscapes]] are places or artifacts created and maintained by people. Examples of cultural intrusions into a landscape are: fences, roads, parking lots, sand pits, buildings, hiking trails, management of plants, including the introduction of [[invasive species]], extraction or removal of plants, management of animals, mining, hunting, [[natural landscaping]], farming and forestry, pollution. Areas that might be confused with a natural landscape include [[public park]]s, farms, orchards, artificial lakes and reservoirs, managed forests, golf courses, nature center trails, gardens.

'''Naturalistic observation''' is, in contrast to [[analog observation]], a research tool in which a subject is observed in its [[natural habitat]] without any manipulation by the observer.&lt;ref name=KCherry&gt;{{cite web |last=Cherry |first=Kendra |title=What Is Naturalistic Observation? |url=http://psychology.about.com/od/nindex/g/naturalistic.htm |publisher=About.com |accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Psychology 202Q Lab: Naturalistic Observation |url=http://www.sp.uconn.edu/~ps202vc/PDF/NaturalisticObservation.pdf |publisher=[[University of Connecticut]] |accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During naturalistic observation, researchers take great care to avoid interfering with the behavior they are observing by using [[Unobtrusive research|unobtrusive]] methods.&lt;ref name=NatObs&gt;{{cite web |title=Naturalistic Observation |publisher=radford.edu |url=http://www.radford.edu/~tpierce/201%20files/201%20handouts/Naturalistic%20Observationl%20ecture%20notes.pdf |accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naturalistic observation involves two main differences that set it apart from other forms of data gathering. In the context of a naturalistic observation, the environment is in no way being manipulated by the observer nor was it created by the observer.&lt;ref name=NatObs/&gt;

[[File:Impala mutualim with birds wide.jpg|left|frameless]]
Naturalistic observation, as a research tool, comes with both advantages and disadvantages that impact its application. By merely observing at a given instance without any manipulation in its natural context, it makes the behaviors exhibited more credible because they are occurring in a real, typical scenario as opposed to an artificial one generated within a lab.&lt;ref name="NatObs" /&gt; Naturalistic observation also allows for study of events that are deemed unethical to study via experimental models, such as the impact of high school shootings on students attending the high school.&lt;ref name="NatObs" /&gt; Naturalistic observation is used in many techniques, from watching an animal's eating patterns in the forest to observing the behavior of students in a school setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://peace.saumag.edu/faculty/kardas/Courses/RMPA/naturalisticobservation.html|title=Naturalistic Observation|website=peace.saumag.edu|access-date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''nature center''' (or '''nature centre''') is an organization with a [[visitor center]] or [[interpretive center]] designed to educate people about nature and the environment. Usually located within a protected [[Open space reserve|open space]], nature centers often have trails through their property.  Some are located within a state or city [[park]], and some have special [[garden]]s or an [[arboretum]].  Their properties can be characterized as nature preserves and wildlife sanctuaries.  Nature centers generally display small live animals, such as [[reptile]]s, [[rodent]]s, [[insect]]s, or [[fish]].  There are often museum exhibits and displays about [[natural history]], or preserved mounted animals or nature [[dioramas]].   Nature centers are staffed by paid or volunteer [[naturalists]] and most offer educational programs to the general public, as well as summer camp, after-school and school group programs.

Some nature centers allow free admission but collect voluntary donations in order to help offset expenses.  They usually rely on support from dedicated [[volunteering|volunteers]].

[[Environmental education]] centers differ from nature centers in that their museum exhibits and education programs are available mostly by appointment, although casual visitors may be allowed to walk on their grounds.

Some city, state and national parks have facilities similar to nature centers, such as museum exhibits, [[dioramas]] and trails, and some offer park nature education programs, usually presented by a [[park ranger]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9251">[[File:Romuvan ritual fire.png|thumb|An ''aukuras'', a type of fire altar found in [[Romuva (religion)|Romuva]], a modern Pagan faith characterised as a "nature religion".]]

A '''nature religion''' is a religious movement that believes [[nature]] and the [[Natural environment|natural world]] is an embodiment of divinity, sacredness or spiritual power.&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 11"/&gt; Nature religions include [[indigenous religion]]s [[Nature worship|practiced]] in various parts of the world by cultures who consider the environment to be imbued with spirits and other sacred entities. It also includes [[modern Paganism|contemporary Pagan]] faiths which are primarily concentrated in Europe and North America.

The term "nature religion" was first coined by the American [[religious studies]] scholar [[Catherine Albanese]], who used it in her work ''Nature Religion in America: From the Algonkian Indians to the New Age'' (1991) and later went on to use it in other studies. Following on from Albanese's development of the term it has since been used by other academics working in the discipline.

==Definition==
Catherine Albanese described nature religion as "a symbolic center and the cluster of beliefs, behaviours, and values that encircles it", deeming it to be useful for shining a light on aspects of history that are rarely viewed as religious.{{sfn|Albanese|1991|pp=7&amp;ndash;8}}
In a paper of his on the subject, the Canadian religious studies scholar Peter Beyer described "nature religion" as a "useful analytical abstraction" to refer to "any religious belief or practice in which devotees consider nature to be the embodiment of divinity, sacredness, transcendence, spiritual power, or whatever cognate term one wishes to use".&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 11"&gt;[[#Bey98|Beyer 1998]]. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to note that in this way nature religion was not an "identifiable religious tradition" such as [[Buddhism]] or [[Christianity]] are, but that it instead covers "a range of religious and quasi-religious movements, groups and social networks whose participants may or may not identify with one of the many constructed religions of global society which referred to many other nature religion."&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 16"&gt;[[#Bey98|Beyer 1998]]. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Amatciems July 2015.jpg|thumb|left|Amatciems, a settlement of [[Ringing Cedars' Anastasians]] in [[Drabeši Parish]], [[Latvia]]. Anastasianism is a Russian-originated modern Pagan movement that sacralises environmental and human nativity (''[[Rod (Slavic religion)|Rod]]''), and is therefore regarded as a "nature religion".]]

===Common characteristics===
Peter Beyer noted the existence of a series of common characteristics which he believed were shared by different nature religions. He remarked that although "one must be careful not to overgeneralise", he suspected that there were a series of features which "occur sufficiently often" in those nature religions known to recorded scholarship to constitute a pattern.&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 17"/&gt;

The first of these common characteristics was nature religion's "comparative resistance to institutionalisation and legitimisation in terms of identifiable socio-religious authorities and organisations", meaning that nature religionists rarely formed their religious beliefs into large, visible socio-political structures such as churches. Furthermore, Beyer noted, nature religionists often held a "concomitant distrust of and even eschewing of politically orientated power".&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 17"/&gt; Instead of this, he felt that among nature religious communities, there was "a valuing of community as non-hierarchical" and a "conditional optimism with regard to human capacity and the future."&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 17"/&gt;

In the sphere of the environment, Beyer noted that nature religionists held to a "holistic conception of reality" and "a valorisation of physical place as vital aspects of their spiritualities".&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 17"/&gt; Similarly, Beyer noted the [[individualism]] which was favoured by nature religionists. He remarked that those adhering to such beliefs typically had respect for "charismatic and hence purely individual authority" and place a "strong emphasis on individual paths" which led them to believe in "the equal value of individuals and groups". Along similar lines, he also commented on the "strong experiential basis" to nature religionist beliefs "where personal experience is a final arbiter of truth or validity".&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 17"/&gt;

==Use within academia==
In April 1996, the [[University of Lancaster]] in North West England held a conference on contemporary Paganism entitled "Nature Religion Today: Western Paganism, Shamanism and Esotericism in the 1990s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Samuel|first=Geoffrey|date=1996-10-01|title=Nature Religion Today: Western Paganism, Shamanism and Esotericism in the 1990s. Conference at the Lake District Campus of Lancaster University, 9th to 13th April 1996|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1006/reli.1996.0031|journal=Religion|volume=26|issue=4|pages=373–376|doi=10.1006/reli.1996.0031|issn=0048-721X}}&lt;/ref&gt;", and ultimately led to the publication of an academic anthology of the same name two years later.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pea98|Pearson, Roberts and Samuel 1998]]. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clifton 2004 8"&gt;[[#Clif04|Clifton 2004]]. p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; This book, ''Nature Religion Today: Paganism in the Modern World'', was edited by members of the University's Department of Religious Studies, a postgraduate named Joanne Pearson and two professors, Richard H. Roberts and Geoffrey Samuel.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pea98|Pearson, Roberts and Samuel 1998]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In his study of [[Wicca]], the [[Pagan studies]] scholar Ethan Doyle White expressed the view that the category of "nature religion" was problematic from a "historical perspective" because it solely emphasises the "commonalities of belief and attitude to the natural world" that are found between different religions and in doing so divorces these different belief systems from their distinctive socio-cultural and historical backgrounds.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=8}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3467">{{Expand French|Nicolas Antoine Boulanger|topic=bio|date=November 2012}}

'''Nicolas Antoine Boulanger''' (11 November 1722, Paris – 16 September 1759, Paris) was a [[France|French]] philosopher and [[man of letters]] during the [[Age of Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name="Persee" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MPC-Asteroid" /&gt;

== Biography ==
Born the son of a paper merchant in Paris, Boulanger studied first mathematics, and later ancient languages.  He composed several philosophical works in which he sought to come up with naturalistic explanations for superstitions and religious practices, all of which were published posthumously.  His major works were ''Research into the Origins of Oriental Despotism'' («Recherches sur l’origine du despotisme oriental», 1761) and ''Antiquity Unveiled'' («L’Antiquité dévoilée par ses usages», 1766). Boulanger's collected works were published in 1792.

The German-born [[Baron d'Holbach]] (Paul-Henri Thiry, 1723–1789) published his controversial anti-religious work ''[[Christianity Unveiled]]'' («Christianisme dévoilé», 1761), using Boulanger's name as his pseudonym, just two years after the philosopher's death.&lt;ref name="Room" /&gt; Boulanger also was one of the first modern critics of Paul.&lt;ref name=" Life of St. Paul" /&gt;

== Honours ==
The Koronian asteroid [[7346 Boulanger]], discovered in 1993, was named in his honor.&lt;ref name="MPC-Asteroid" /&gt;

The '''origin of water on Earth''', or the reason that there is clearly more liquid [[water]] on [[Earth]] than on the other [[terrestrial planet|rocky planets]] of the [[Solar System]], is not completely understood. There exist numerous more or less mutually compatible hypotheses as to how water may have accumulated on Earth's surface over [[history of Earth|the past 4.5 billion years]] in sufficient quantity to form [[ocean]]s.

==Possible sources==

===Extraplanetary sources===
[[Comet]]s, [[trans-Neptunian object]]s, or water-rich [[meteoroid]]s ([[protoplanet]]s) from the outer reaches of the [[asteroid belt]] colliding with Earth may have brought water to the world's oceans.

This could cause water to rise to the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://phys.org/news/2014-02-earth.html|title=How Earth was watered|access-date=2016-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies suggest that water with similar deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio was already available at the time of Earth's formation, as evidenced in ancient [[eucrite]] meteorites originating from the asteroid Vesta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sarafian|first=Adam R.|last2=Nielsen|first2=Sune G.|last3=Marschall|first3=Horst R.|last4=McCubbin|first4=Francis M.|last5=Monteleone|first5=Brian D.|date=2014-10-31|title=Early accretion of water in the inner solar system from a carbonaceous chondrite–like source|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/346/6209/623|journal=Science|language=en|volume=346|issue=6209|pages=623–626|doi=10.1126/science.1256717|issn=0036-8075|pmid=25359971|bibcode=2014Sci...346..623S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That Earth's water originated purely from comets is implausible, since a result of measurements of the isotope ratios of [[deuterium]] to [[hydrogen-1|protium]] (D/H ratio) in the four comets [[Halley's Comet|Halley]], [[Comet Hyakutake|Hyakutake]], [[Comet Hale–Bopp|Hale–Bopp]], and [[67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko]], by researchers such as [[David Jewitt]], is approximately double that of oceanic water. What is, however, unclear is whether these comets are representative of those from the [[Kuiper belt]]. According to Alessandro Morbidelli,&lt;ref&gt;Alessandro Morbidelli et al. [[Meteoritics &amp; Planetary Science]] 35, 2000, S. 1309–1329&lt;/ref&gt; the largest part of today's water comes from protoplanets formed in the outer asteroid belt that plunged towards Earth, as indicated by the D/H proportions in carbon-rich chondrites. The water in carbon-rich chondrites point to a similar D/H ratio as oceanic water. Nevertheless, mechanisms have been proposed&lt;ref&gt;H. Genda, M. Ikoma, Origin of the Ocean on the Earth: Early Evolution of Water D/H in a Hydrogen-rich Atmosphere. Accessible at https://arxiv.org/abs/0709.2025&lt;/ref&gt; to suggest that the D/H-ratio of oceanic water may have increased significantly throughout Earth's history. Such a proposal is consistent with the possibility that a significant amount of the water on Earth was already present during the planet's early evolution.

Recent measurements of the chemical composition of Moon rocks suggest that Earth was born with its water already present. Investigating lunar samples carried to Earth by the Apollo 15 and 17 missions found a deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio that matched the isotopic ratio in carbonaceous chondrites. The ratio is also similar to that found in water on Earth. The findings suggest a common source of water for both objects. This supports a theory that Jupiter temporarily migrated into the inner Solar System, destabilizing the orbits of water-rich carbonaceous chondrites. As a result, some of the bodies could have fallen inwards and become part of the raw material for making Earth and its neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cowen|first=Ron|title=Common source for Earth and Moon water|journal=Nature|date=9 May 2013|url=https://www.nature.com/news/common-source-for-earth-and-moon-water-1.12963 |doi= 10.1038/nature.2013.12963}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of water vapor out-gassing from Ceres provides related information on water-ice content of the asteroid belt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Herschel discovers water vapour around dwarf planet Ceres|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Herschel/Herschel_discovers_water_vapour_around_dwarf_planet_Ceres|work=European Space Agency|accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Water in the development of Earth==
{{Life timeline}}
{{See also|Planetary differentiation}}
A sizeable quantity of water would have been in the material that formed Earth.&lt;ref name="source_mrk1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="source_mrk2"/&gt; Water molecules would have escaped Earth's gravity more easily when it was less [[mass]]ive during its formation. Hydrogen and helium are expected to leak from the atmosphere continually, but the lack of denser [[noble gas]]es in the modern atmosphere suggests that something disastrous happened to the early atmosphere.

Part of the young planet is theorized to have been disrupted by the [[giant impact hypothesis|impact which created the Moon]], which should have caused melting of one or two large areas. Present composition does not match complete melting and it is hard to melt and mix huge rock masses completely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/scitech/display.cfm?ST_ID=446 |title=Solar System Exploration: Science &amp; Technology: Science Features: View Feature |publisher=Solarsystem.nasa.gov |date=2004-04-26 |accessdate=2009-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69kxiqRQz?url=http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/scitech/display.cfm?ST_ID=446 |archivedate=2012-08-08 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a fair fraction of material should have been vaporized by this impact, creating a rock-vapor atmosphere around the young planet. The rock vapor would have condensed within two thousand years, leaving behind hot volatiles which probably resulted in a heavy [[carbon dioxide]] atmosphere with hydrogen and [[water vapor]]. Liquid water oceans existed despite the surface temperature of {{Convert|230|C|}} because of the atmospheric pressure of the heavy CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; atmosphere. As cooling continued, [[subduction]] and dissolving in ocean water removed most CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the atmosphere but levels oscillated wildly as new surface and [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] cycles appeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=N.

The [[Cool early Earth]] theory covers a range from about 4.4 Ga to 4.0 Ga.

In fact, recent studies of zircons (in the fall of 2008) found in Australian Hadean rock hold minerals that point to the existence of [[plate tectonics]] as early as 4 billion years ago. If this holds true, the previous beliefs about the [[Hadean|Hadean period]] are far from correct. That is, rather than a hot, molten surface and atmosphere full of carbon dioxide, Earth's surface would be very much like it is today. The action of plate tectonics traps vast amounts of carbon dioxide, thereby reducing [[greenhouse effect]]s, and leading to a much cooler surface temperature, and the formation of solid rock, and possibly even life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/02/science/02eart.html?8dpc |work=[[The New York Times]] |title=A New Picture of the Early Earth |first=Kenneth |last=Chang |date=2008-12-02 |accessdate=2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of organisms==
Some terrestrial water may have had a biochemical origin, during the [[Great Oxygenation Event]], via [[redox|redox reactions]] and [[photosynthesis]].&lt;ref name="The oxygenation of the atmosphere and oceans"&gt;{{citation|title=The oxygenation of the atmosphere and oceans |url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/361/1470/903.full.pdf|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences |date=29 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1930s, [[C. B. van Niel|Cornelis van Niel]] discovered that sulfide-dependent chemoautotrophic bacteria ([[purple sulfur bacteria]]) fix carbon and synthesize water as a byproduct of a photosynthetic pathway using [[hydrogen sulfide]] and carbon dioxide:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=van Niel|first=C.B.|title=Photosynthesis of bacteria|journal=Arch. Mikrobiol.|date=1931|volume=3|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S → CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 2S

Few modern organisms use this method of photosynthesis, making their water contribution negligible. But on the hydrogen-sulfide-rich and oxygen-poor early Earth, a small but significant portion of Earth's water may have been synthesized biochemically through this pathway.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

The '''Peterson Identification System''' is a practical method for the field identification of [[Animal identification|animals]], plants and other natural phenomena. It was devised by [[ornithologist]] [[Roger Tory Peterson]] in 1934 for the first of his series of ''Field Guide''s&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, Roger Tory (1934), ''A Field Guide to the Birds'', [[Boston]]: [[Houghton Mifflin Company]].&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Peterson Field Guides]].) Peterson devised his system "so that live birds could be identified readily at a distance by their 'field marks' without resorting to the bird-in-hand characters that the early collectors relied on. During the last half century the binocular and the spotting scope have replaced the shotgun."&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, Roger Tory (1980), ''A Field Guide to the Birds: A Completely New Guide to All the Birds of Eastern and Central North America'', Fourth Edition, Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, pg 7.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, it both reflected and contributed to awareness of the emerging early [[environmental movement]].

==The system==
Created for use by [[amateur]] naturalists and [[laymen]], rather than specialists, the "Peterson System" is essentially a pictorial key based upon readily noticed visual impressions rather than on the technical features of interest to scientists. The technique involves patternistic drawings with arrows that pinpoint the key field comparisons between similar species.

==Influence==
Since the first Peterson ''Field Guide'', the system has been expanded to about three dozen volumes in the series as well as being emulated by many other publishers and authors of [[field guide]]s. It has become the near-universally accepted standard, first in the United States and Europe and then around the world.

In the field of [[microbiome]] research, a group of [[species]] is said to show a '''phylosymbiotic''' signal if the degree of similarity between the species' microbiomes recapitulates to a significant extent their [[evolutionary history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=W. Brooks|first1=Andrew|title=Phylosymbiosis: Relationships and Functional Effects of Microbial Communities across Host Evolutionary History|journal=PLOS Biology|date=November 18, 2016|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.2000225.g004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In other words, a phylosymbiotic signal among a group of species is evident if their microbiome similarity [[dendrogram]] could significantly
recapitulate their hosts phylogenic tree. For the analysis of the phylosymbiotic signal to be reliable, environmental differences
that could shape the host microbiome should be either eliminated or accounted for.
One plausible mechanistic explanation for such phenomena could be, for example, a result of host immune genes that rapidly evolve in a continues [[arms race]] with members of its microbiome.

[[File:Gyroscope precession.gif|thumb|Precession of a [[gyroscope]]]]

'''Precession''' is a change in the [[orientation (geometry)|orientation]] of the rotational axis of a [[rotation|rotating]] body. In an appropriate [[frame of reference|reference frame]] it can be defined as a change in the first [[Euler angles|Euler angle]], whereas the third Euler angle defines the [[rotation around a fixed axis|rotation itself]]. In other words, if the axis of rotation of a body is itself rotating about a second axis, that body is said to be precessing about the second axis. A motion in which the second Euler angle changes is called ''[[nutation]]''. In [[physics]], there are two types of precession: [[torque]]-free and torque-induced.

In astronomy, ''precession'' refers to any of several slow changes in an astronomical body's rotational or orbital parameters. An important example is the steady change in the orientation of the axis of rotation of the [[Earth]], known as the [[axial precession|precession of the equinoxes]].

==Torque-free==
Torque-free precession implies that no external moment (torque) is applied to the body. In torque-free precession, the [[angular momentum]] is a constant, but the [[angular velocity]] vector changes orientation with time. What makes this possible is a time-varying [[moment of inertia]], or more precisely, a time-varying [[Moment of inertia#The inertia tensor|inertia matrix]]. The inertia matrix is composed of the moments of inertia of a body calculated with respect to separate [[Basis (linear algebra)|coordinate axes]] (e.g. {{math|''x''}}, {{math|''y''}}, {{math|''z''}}). If an object is asymmetric about its principal axis of rotation, the moment of inertia with respect to each coordinate direction will change with time, while preserving angular momentum. The result is that the [[Vector component#Decomposition|component]] of the angular velocities of the body about each axis will vary inversely with each axis' moment of inertia.

The torque-free precession rate of an object with an axis of symmetry, such as a disk, spinning about an axis not aligned with that axis of symmetry can be calculated as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

where {{math|'''''ω'''''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the precession rate, {{math|'''''ω'''''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the spin rate about the axis of symmetry, {{math|'''''I'''''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the moment of inertia about the axis of symmetry, {{math|'''''I'''''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;}} is moment of inertia about either of the other two equal perpendicular principal axes, and {{math|'''''α'''''}} is the angle between the moment of inertia direction and the symmetry axis.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When an object is not perfectly [[solid]], internal [[vortices]] will tend to damp torque-free precession, and the rotation axis will align itself with one of the inertia axes of the body.

For a generic solid object without any axis of symmetry, the evolution of the object's orientation, represented (for example) by a rotation matrix {{math|'''''R'''''}} that transforms internal to external coordinates, may be numerically simulated. Given the object's fixed internal [[moment of inertia tensor]] {{math|'''''I'''''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} and fixed external angular momentum {{math|'''''L'''''}}, the instantaneous angular velocity is
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\omega\left(\boldsymbol R\right) = \boldsymbol R \boldsymbol I_0^{-1} \boldsymbol R ^T \boldsymbol L&lt;/math&gt;
Precession occurs by repeatedly recalculating {{math|'''''ω'''''}} and applying a small [[Rotation representation (mathematics)#Euler axis and angle .28rotation vector.29|rotation vector]] {{math|'''''ω''' dt''}} for the short time {{math|''dt''}}; e.g.:
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol R_\text{new} = \exp\left(\left[\boldsymbol\omega\left(\boldsymbol R_\text{old}\right)\right]_{\times} dt\right) \boldsymbol R_\text{old}&lt;/math&gt;
for the [[Cross product#Conversion to matrix multiplication|skew-symmetric matrix]] {{math|['''''ω''''']&lt;sub&gt;×&lt;/sub&gt;}}. The errors induced by finite time steps tend to increase the rotational kinetic energy:
:&lt;math&gt;E\left(\boldsymbol R\right) = \boldsymbol \omega\left(\boldsymbol R\right) \cdot \frac{\boldsymbol L }{ 2}&lt;/math&gt;
this unphysical tendency can be counteracted by repeatedly applying a small rotation vector {{math|'''''v'''''}} perpendicular to both {{math|'''''ω'''''}} and {{math|'''''L'''''}}, noting that

Another type of torque-free precession can occur when there are multiple reference frames at work. For example, Earth is subject to local torque induced precession due to the gravity of the sun and moon acting on Earth's axis, but at the same time the solar system is moving around the galactic center. As a consequence, an accurate measurement of Earth's axial reorientation relative to objects outside the frame of the moving galaxy (such as distant quasars commonly used as precession measurement reference points) must account for a minor amount of non-local torque-free precession, due to the solar system’s motion.

==Torque-induced==
Torque-induced precession ('''gyroscopic precession''') is the phenomenon in which the [[axis of rotation|axis]] of a spinning object (e.g., a [[gyroscope]]) describes a [[Cone (geometry)|cone]] in space when an external [[torque]] is applied to it. The phenomenon is commonly seen in a [[spinning top|spinning toy top]], but all rotating objects can undergo precession. If the [[speed]] of the rotation and the [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] of the external torque are constant, the spin axis will move at [[right angle]]s to the [[Direction (geometry, geography)|direction]] that would intuitively result from the external torque. In the case of a toy top, its weight is acting downwards from its center of mass and the [[normal force]] (reaction) of the ground is pushing up on it at the point of contact with the support. These two opposite forces produce a torque which causes the top to precess.

[[Image:Gyroscopic precession 256x256.png|frame|right|The response of a rotating system to an applied torque. When the device swivels, and some roll is added, the wheel tends to pitch.]]
The device depicted on the right (or above on mobile devices) is [[gimbal]] mounted. From inside to outside there are three axes of rotation: the hub of the wheel, the gimbal axis, and the vertical pivot.

To distinguish between the two horizontal axes, rotation around the wheel hub will be called ''spinning'', and rotation around the gimbal axis will be called ''pitching''.  Rotation around the vertical pivot axis is called ''rotation''.

First, imagine that the entire device is rotating around the (vertical) pivot axis. Then, spinning of the wheel (around the wheelhub) is added. Imagine the gimbal axis to be locked, so that the wheel cannot pitch. The gimbal axis has sensors, that measure whether there is a [[torque]] around the gimbal axis.

In the picture, a section of the wheel has been named {{math|''dm''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}. At the depicted moment in time, section {{math|''dm''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is at the [[perimeter]] of the rotating motion around the (vertical) pivot axis. Section {{math|''dm''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, therefore, has a lot of angular rotating [[velocity]] with respect to the rotation around the pivot axis, and as {{math|''dm''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is forced closer to the pivot axis of the rotation (by the wheel spinning further), because of the [[Coriolis effect]], with respect to the vertical pivot axis, {{math|''dm''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} tends to move in the direction of the top-left arrow in the diagram (shown at 45°) in the direction of rotation around the pivot axis.&lt;ref name="Teodorescu"&gt;{{cite book

Note that both arrows point in the same direction.

The same reasoning applies for the bottom half of the wheel, but there the arrows point in the opposite direction to that of the top arrows. Combined over the entire wheel, there is a torque around the gimbal axis when some spinning is added to rotation around a vertical axis.

It is important to note that the torque around the gimbal axis arises without any delay; the response is instantaneous.

In the discussion above, the setup was kept unchanging by preventing pitching around the gimbal axis. In the case of a spinning toy top, when the spinning top starts tilting, gravity exerts a torque. However, instead of rolling over, the spinning top just pitches a little. This pitching motion reorients the spinning top with respect to the torque that is being exerted. The result is that the torque exerted by gravity – via the pitching motion – elicits gyroscopic precession (which in turn yields a counter torque against the gravity torque) rather than causing the spinning top to fall to its side.

Precession or gyroscopic considerations have an effect on [[bicycle]] performance at high speed. Precession is also the mechanism behind [[gyrocompass]]es.

===Classical (Newtonian)===

[[Image:PrecessionOfATop.svg|thumb|right|300px|The [[torque]] caused by the normal force – {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;}} and the weight of the top causes a change in the [[angular momentum]] {{math|'''L'''}} in the direction of that torque. This causes the top to precess.]]

Precession is the change of [[angular velocity]] and [[angular momentum]] produced by a torque. The general equation that relates the torque to the rate of change of angular momentum is:

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\tau} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{L}}{\mathrm{d}t}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\tau}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}&lt;/math&gt; are the torque and angular momentum vectors respectively.

Due to the way the torque vectors are defined, it is a vector that is perpendicular to the plane of the forces that create it. Thus it may be seen that the angular momentum vector will change perpendicular to those forces. Depending on how the forces are created, they will often rotate with the angular momentum vector, and then circular precession is created.

Under these circumstances the angular velocity of precession is given by:{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\omega_\mathrm{p} = \frac{\ mgr}{I_\mathrm{s}\boldsymbol\omega_\mathrm{s}} = \frac{ \tau}{I_\mathrm{s}\boldsymbol\omega_\mathrm{s}}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[moment of inertia]], {{math|'''''ω'''''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the angular velocity of spin about the spin axis, {{math|''m''}} is the mass, {{math|''g''}} is the acceleration due to gravity and {{math|''r''}} is the perpendicular distance of the spin axis about the axis of precession.  The torque vector originates at the center of mass. Using {{math|'''''ω''''' {{=}} {{sfrac|2π|''T''}}}}, we find that the [[Frequency|period]] of precession is given by:{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

:&lt;math&gt;T_\mathrm{p} = \frac{4\pi^2 I_\mathrm{s}}{\ mgrT_\mathrm{s}} = \frac{4\pi^2 I_\mathrm{s}}{\ \tau T_\mathrm{s}}&lt;/math&gt;

Where {{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[moment of inertia]], {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the period of spin about the spin axis, and {{math|'''''τ'''''}} is the [[torque]]&lt;!-- Torque is not introduced --&gt;. In general, the problem is more complicated than this, however.

There is an easy way to understand why gyroscopic precession occurs without using any mathematics. The behavior of a spinning object simply obeys laws of inertia by resisting any change in direction. A spinning object possesses a property known as rigidity in space, meaning the spin axis resists any change in orientation. It is the inertia of matter comprising the object as it resists any change in direction that provides this property. Of course, the direction this matter travels constantly changes as the object spins, but any further change in direction is resisted. If a force is applied to the surface of a spinning disc, for example, matter experiences no change in direction at the place the force was applied (or 180 degrees from that place). But 90 degrees before and 90 degrees after that place, matter is forced to change direction. This causes the object to behave as if the force was applied at those places instead. When a force is applied to anything, the object exerts an equal force back but in the opposite direction. Since no actual force was applied 90 degrees before or after, nothing prevents the reaction from taking place, and the object causes itself to move in response. A good way to visualize why this happens is to imagine the spinning object to be a large hollow doughnut filled with water, as described in the book "Thinking Physics" by Lewis Epstein. The doughnut is held still while water circulates inside it. As the force is applied, the water inside is caused to change direction 90 degrees before and after that point. The water then exerts its own force against the inner wall of the doughnut and causes the doughnut to rotate as if the force was applied 90 degrees ahead in the direction of rotation. Epstein exaggerates the vertical and horizontal motion of the water by changing the shape of the doughnut from round to square with rounded corners.   

Now imagine the object to be a spinning bicycle wheel, held at both ends of its axle in the hands of a subject. The wheel is spinning clock-wise as seen from a viewer to the subject’s right. Clock positions on the wheel are given relative to this viewer. As the wheel spins, the molecules comprising it are traveling exactly horizontal and to the right the instant they pass the 12-o'clock position. They then travel vertically downward the instant they pass 3 o'clock, horizontally to the left at 6 o'clock, vertically upward at 9 o’clock and horizontally to the right again at 12 o'clock. Between these positions, each molecule travels components of these directions. Now imagine the viewer applying a force to the rim of the wheel at 12 o’clock. For this example’s sake, imagine the wheel tilting over when this force is applied; it tilts to the left as seen from the subject holding it at its axle. As the wheel tilts to its new position, molecules at 12 o’clock (where the force was applied) as well as those at 6 o’clock, still travel horizontally; their direction did not change as the wheel was tilting. Nor is their direction different after the wheel settles in its new position; they still move horizontally the instant they pass 12 and 6 o’clock. BUT, molecules passing 3 and 9 o’clock were forced to change direction. Those at 3 o’clock were forced to change from moving straight downward, to downward and to the right as viewed from the subject holding the wheel. Molecules passing 9 o’clock were forced to change from moving straight upward, to upward and to the left. This change in direction is resisted by the inertia of those molecules. And when they experience this change in direction, they exert an equal and opposite force in response AT THOSE LOCATIONS-3 AND 9 O’CLOCK. At 3 o’clock, where they were forced to change from moving straight down to downward and to the right, they exert their own equal and opposite reactive force to the left. At 9 o’clock, they exert their own reactive force to the right, as viewed from the subject holding the wheel. This makes the wheel as a whole react by momentarily rotating counter-clockwise as viewed from directly above. Thus, as the force was applied at 12 o’clock, the wheel behaved as if that force was applied at 3 o’clock, which is 90 degrees ahead in the direction of spin. Or, you can say it behaved as if a force from the opposite direction was applied at 9 o'clock, 90 degrees prior to the direction of spin.

In summary, when you apply a force to a spinning object to change the direction of its spin axis, you are not changing the direction of the matter comprising the object at the place you applied the force (nor at 180 degrees from it); matter experiences zero change in direction at those places. Matter experiences the maximum change in direction 90 degrees before and 90 degrees beyond that place, and lesser amounts closer to it. The equal and opposite reaction that occurs 90 degrees before and after then causes the object to behave as it does. This principle is demonstrated in helicopters. Helicopter controls are rigged so that inputs to them are transmitted to the rotor blades at points 90 degrees prior to and 90 degrees beyond the point at which the change in aircraft attitude is desired. The effect is dramatically felt on motorcycles. A motorcycle will suddenly lean and turn in the opposite direction the handle bars are turned.  

Gyro precession causes another phenomenon for spinning objects such as the bicycle wheel in this scenario. If the subject holding the wheel removes a hand from one end of its axle, the wheel will not topple over, but will remain upright, supported at just the other end. However, it will immediately take on an additional motion; it will begin to rotate about a vertical axis, pivoting at the point of support as it continues spinning. If you allowed the wheel to continue rotating, you would have to turn your body in the same direction as the wheel rotated. If the wheel was not spinning, it would obviously topple over and fall when one hand is removed. The initial action of the wheel beginning to topple over is equivalent to applying a force to it at 12 o'clock in the direction toward the unsupported side (or a force at 6 o’clock toward the supported side). When the wheel is spinning, the sudden lack of support at one end of its axle is equivalent to this same force. So, instead of toppling over, the wheel behaves as if a continuous force is being applied to it at 3 or 9 o’clock, depending on the direction of spin and which hand was removed. This causes the wheel to begin pivoting at the one supported end of its axle while remaining upright. Although it pivots at that point, it does so only because of the fact that it is supported there; the actual axis of precessional rotation is located vertically through the wheel, passing through its center of mass. Also, this explanation does not account for the effect of variation in the speed of the spinning object; it only illustrates how the spin axis behaves due to precession. More correctly, the object behaves according to the balance of all forces based on the magnitude of the applied force, mass and rotational speed of the object. Once it is visualized why the wheel remains upright and rotates, it can easily be seen why the axis of a spinning top slowly rotates while the top spins as shown in the illustration on this page. A top behaves exactly like the bicycle wheel due to the force of gravity pulling downward. The point of contact with the surface it spins on is equivalent to the end of the axle the wheel is supported at. As the top's spin slows, the reactive force that keeps it upright due to inertia is overcome by gravity. Once the reason for gyro precession is visualized, the mathematical formulas start to make sense. 

===Relativistic (Einsteinian) ===
The special and general theories of [[Theory of relativity|relativity]] give three types of corrections to the Newtonian precession, of a gyroscope near a large mass such as Earth, described above. They are:
* [[Thomas precession]] a special relativistic correction accounting for the observer's being in a rotating non-inertial frame.
* [[Geodetic effect|de Sitter precession]] a general relativistic correction accounting for the Schwarzschild metric of curved space near a large non-rotating mass.
* [[Lense–Thirring precession]] a general relativistic correction accounting for the frame dragging by the Kerr metric of curved space near a large rotating mass.

== Astronomy ==

In astronomy, precession refers to any of several gravity-induced, slow and continuous changes in an astronomical body's rotational axis or orbital path. Precession of the equinoxes, perihelion precession, changes in the [[Axial tilt#Earth|tilt of Earth's axis]] to its orbit, and the [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of its orbit over tens of thousands of years are all important parts of the astronomical theory of [[ice age]]s. ''(See [[Milankovitch cycles]].)''

=== Axial precession (precession of the equinoxes) ===
{{Main article|Axial precession}}

Axial precession is the movement of the rotational axis of an astronomical body, whereby the axis slowly traces out a cone. In the case of Earth, this type of precession is also known as the ''precession of the equinoxes'', ''lunisolar precession'', or ''precession of the equator''. Earth goes through one such complete precessional cycle in a period of approximately 26,000 years or 1° every 72 years, during which the positions of stars will slowly change in both [[equatorial coordinates]] and [[ecliptic longitude]]. Over this cycle, Earth's north axial pole moves from where it is now, within 1° of [[Polaris]], in a circle around the [[ecliptic pole]], with an angular radius of about 23.5°.

The [[Greek astronomy|ancient Greek astronomer]] [[Hipparchus]] (c. 190-120 BC) is claimed to be the earliest known astronomer to recognize and assess the precession of the equinoxes at about 1° per century (which is not far from the actual value for antiquity, 1.38°).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dioi.org/vols/w91.pdf DIO 9.1 ‡3]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Caltech]]'s Swerdlow disputes Hipparchus's knowledge of precession because Hipparchus apparently did not necessarily indicate anything like a motion of the entire sphere of the fixed stars with respect to the equinoxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Apsidal precession===
[[File:Precessing Kepler orbit 280frames e0.6 smaller.gif|thumb|[[Apsidal precession]]—the orbit rotates gradually over time.]]
{{main|Apsidal precession}}

The [[orbit]]s of planets around the [[Sun]] do not really follow an identical ellipse each time, but actually trace out a flower-petal shape because the major axis of each planet's elliptical orbit also precesses within its orbital plane, partly in response to perturbations in the form of the changing gravitational forces exerted by other planets. This is called [[apsidal precession|perihelion precession or apsidal precession]].

In the adjunct image, Earth's apsidal precession is illustrated. As the Earth travels around the Sun, its elliptical orbit rotates gradually over time. The eccentricity of its ellipse and the precession rate of its orbit are exaggerated for visualization. Most orbits in the Solar System have a much smaller eccentricity and precess at a much slower rate, making them nearly circular and stationary.

Discrepancies between the observed perihelion precession rate of the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and that predicted by [[classical mechanics]] were prominent among the forms of experimental evidence leading to the acceptance of [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[Theory of Relativity]] (in particular, his [[General relativity|General Theory of Relativity]]), which accurately predicted the anomalies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Born]] (1924), ''Einstein's Theory of Relativity'' (The 1962 Dover edition, page 348 lists a table documenting the observed and calculated values for the precession of the perihelion of Mercury, Venus, and Earth.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailygalaxy.com/my_weblog/2008/03/18-billion-suns.html An even larger value for a precession has been found, for a black hole in orbit around a much more massive black hole, amounting to 39 degrees each orbit.]&lt;/ref&gt; Deviating from Newton's law, Einstein's theory of gravitation predicts an extra term of {{math|{{sfrac|''A''|''r''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}}}}, which accurately gives the observed excess turning rate of 43″ every 100 years.

The gravitational force between the Sun and moon induces the precession in Earth's orbit, which is the major cause of the climate oscillation of Earth that has a period of 19,000 to 23,000 years. It follows that changes in Earth's orbital parameters (e.g., orbital inclination, the angle between Earth's rotation axis and its plane of orbit) is important to the study of Earth's climate, in particular to the study of past ice ages.

'''Pressure measurement''' is the analysis of an applied [[force]] by a [[fluid]] ([[liquid]] or [[gas]]) on a surface. [[Pressure]] is typically measured in units of force per unit of surface area. Many techniques have been developed for the measurement of pressure and [[vacuum]]. Instruments used to measure and display pressure in an integral unit are called '''pressure gauges''' or '''vacuum gauges'''. A '''manometer''' (not to be confused with [[nanometer]]) is a good example, as it uses a column of liquid to both measure and indicate pressure. Likewise the widely used Bourdon gauge is a mechanical device, which both measures and indicates and is probably the best known type of gauge.

A vacuum gauge is a pressure gauge used to measure pressures lower than the ambient atmospheric pressure, which is set as the zero point, in negative values (e.g.: −15&amp;nbsp;[[psig]] or −760&amp;nbsp;[[mmHg]] equals total vacuum). Most gauges measure pressure relative to atmospheric pressure as the zero point, so this form of reading is simply referred to as "gauge pressure". However, anything greater than total vacuum is technically a form of pressure. For very accurate readings, especially at very low pressures, a gauge that uses total vacuum as the zero point may be used, giving pressure readings in an [[absolute scale]].

Other methods of pressure measurement involve sensors that can transmit the pressure reading to a remote indicator or control system ([[telemetry]]).

==Absolute, gauge and differential pressures — zero reference==
{{Anchor|Absolute|Gauge|Differential|Absolute, gauge and differential}}
Everyday pressure measurements, such as for vehicle tire pressure, are usually made relative to ambient air pressure. In other cases measurements are made relative to a vacuum or to some other specific reference. When distinguishing between these zero references, the following terms are used:
*'''{{visible anchor|Absolute pressure}}''' is zero-referenced against a perfect vacuum, using an [[absolute scale]], so it is equal to gauge pressure plus atmospheric pressure.
*'''{{visible anchor|Gauge pressure}}''' is zero-referenced against ambient air pressure, so it is equal to absolute pressure minus atmospheric pressure. Negative signs are usually omitted.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} To distinguish a negative pressure, the value may be appended with the word "vacuum" or the gauge may be labeled a "vacuum gauge". These are further divided into two subcategories: high and low vacuum (and sometimes [[ultra-high vacuum]]). The applicable pressure ranges of many of the techniques used to measure vacuums have an overlap. Hence, by combining several different types of gauge, it is possible to measure system pressure continuously from 10&amp;nbsp;[[Bar (unit)|mbar]] down to 10&lt;sup&gt;−11&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;mbar.
*'''{{visible anchor|Differential pressure}}''' is the difference in pressure between two points.

The zero reference in use is usually implied by context, and these words are added only when clarification is needed. [[Tire-pressure gauge|Tire pressure]] and [[sphygmomanometer|blood pressure]] are gauge pressures by convention, while [[atmospheric pressure]]s, deep vacuum pressures, and [[altimeter|altimeter pressures]] must be absolute.

For most [[working fluid]]s where a fluid exists in a [[closed system]], gauge pressure measurement prevails. Pressure instruments connected to the system will indicate pressures relative to the current atmospheric pressure. The situation changes when extreme vacuum pressures are measured, then absolute pressures are typically used instead.

Differential pressures are commonly used in industrial process systems. Differential pressure gauges have two inlet ports, each connected to one of the volumes whose pressure is to be monitored.  In effect, such a gauge performs the mathematical operation of subtraction through mechanical means, obviating the need for an operator or control system to watch two separate gauges and determine the difference in readings.

Moderate vacuum pressure readings can be ambiguous without the proper context, as they may represent absolute pressure or gauge pressure without a negative sign. Thus a vacuum of 26&amp;nbsp;inHg gauge is equivalent to an absolute pressure of 30&amp;nbsp;inHg (typical atmospheric pressure) − 26&amp;nbsp;inHg = 4&amp;nbsp;inHg.

Atmospheric pressure is typically about 100&amp;nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|kPa]] at sea level, but is variable with altitude and weather. If the absolute pressure of a fluid stays constant, the gauge pressure of the same fluid will vary as atmospheric pressure changes. For example, when a car drives up a mountain, the (gauge) tire pressure goes up because atmospheric pressure goes down. The absolute pressure in the tire is essentially unchanged.

Using atmospheric pressure as reference is usually signified by a "g" for gauge after the pressure unit, e.g. 70&amp;nbsp;psig, which means that the pressure measured is the total pressure minus [[atmospheric pressure]].  There are two types of gauge reference pressure: vented gauge (vg) and sealed gauge (sg).

A vented-gauge [[pressure transmitter]], for example, allows the outside air pressure to be exposed to the negative side of the pressure-sensing diaphragm, through a vented cable or a hole on the side of the device, so that it always measures the pressure referred to ambient [[barometric pressure]].  Thus a vented-gauge reference [[pressure sensor]] should always read zero pressure when the process pressure connection is held open to the air.

A sealed gauge reference is very similar, except that atmospheric pressure is sealed on the negative side of the diaphragm.  This is usually adopted on high pressure ranges, such as [[hydraulics]], where atmospheric pressure changes will have a negligible effect on the accuracy of the reading, so venting is not necessary.  This also allows some manufacturers to provide secondary pressure containment as an extra precaution for pressure equipment safety if the burst pressure of the primary pressure sensing [[diaphragm seal|diaphragm]] is exceeded.

There is another way of creating a sealed gauge reference, and this is to seal a high [[vacuum]] on the reverse side of the sensing diaphragm.  Then the output signal is offset, so the pressure sensor reads close to zero when measuring atmospheric pressure.

A sealed gauge reference [[pressure transducer]] will never read exactly zero because atmospheric pressure is always changing and the reference in this case is fixed at 1 bar.

To produce an [[absolute pressure sensor]], the manufacturer seals a high vacuum behind the sensing diaphragm. If the process-pressure connection of an absolute-pressure transmitter is open to the air, it will read the actual [[barometric pressure]].

==Units==
{{Pressure Units}}

The [[SI]] unit for pressure is the [[pascal (unit)|pascal]] (Pa), equal to one [[newton (unit)|newton]] per [[square metre]] (N·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; or kg·m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;). This special name for the unit was added in 1971; before that, pressure in SI was expressed in units such as N·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;. When indicated, the zero reference is stated in parenthesis following the unit, for example 101 kPa (abs). The [[pounds per square inch|pound per square inch]] (psi) is still in widespread use in the US and Canada, for measuring, for instance, tire pressure. A letter is often appended to the psi unit to indicate the measurement's zero reference; psia for absolute, psig for gauge, psid for differential, although this practice is discouraged by the [[NIST]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/sec07.html#7.4 NIST]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because pressure was once commonly measured by its ability to displace a column of liquid in a manometer, pressures are often expressed as a depth of a particular fluid (''e.g.,'' inches of water). Manometric measurement is the subject of [[pressure head]] calculations. The most common choices for a manometer's fluid are [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] (Hg) and water; water is nontoxic and readily available, while mercury's density allows for a shorter column (and so a smaller manometer) to measure a given pressure. The abbreviation "W.C." or the words "water column" are often printed on gauges and measurements that use water for the manometer.

Fluid density and local gravity can vary from one reading to another depending on local factors, so the height of a fluid column does not define pressure precisely. So measurements in "[[mmHg|millimetres of mercury]]" or "[[inHg|inches of mercury]]" can be converted to SI units as long as attention is paid to the local factors of fluid density and [[Gravity of Earth|gravity]]. Temperature fluctuations change the value of fluid density, while location can affect gravity.

Although no longer preferred, these '''manometric units''' are still encountered in many fields. [[Blood pressure]] is measured in millimetres of mercury (see [[torr]]) in most of the world, [[central venous pressure]] and lung pressures in [[centimetre of water|centimeters of water]] are still common, as in settings for CPAP machines. Natural gas pipeline pressures are measured in [[inch of water|inches of water]], expressed as "inches W.C." [[Scuba diving|Scuba divers]] often use a manometric [[rule of thumb]]: the pressure exerted by ten meters depth of sea water ("10 msw") is approximately equal to one atmosphere. In vacuum systems, the units [[torr]] (millimeter of mercury), [[Micron (disambiguation)|micron]] (micrometer of mercury),&lt;ref&gt;http://vacaero.com/information-resources/vacuum-pump-practice-with-howard-tring/1290-understanding-vacuum-measurement-units.html&lt;/ref&gt; and inch of mercury ([[inHg]]) are most commonly used. Torr and micron usually indicates an absolute pressure, while inHg usually indicates a gauge pressure.

Atmospheric pressures are usually stated using hectopascal (hPa), kilopascal (kPa), millibar (mbar) or atmospheres ([[atmosphere (unit)|atm]]). In American and Canadian engineering, [[Stress (physics)|stress]] is often measured in [[kip (unit)|kip]]. Note that stress is not a true pressure since it is not [[scalar (physics)|scalar]]. In the [[cgs]] system the unit of pressure was the [[barye]] (ba), equal to 1 dyn·cm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;. In the [[Metre-tonne-second system of units|mts]] system, the unit of  pressure was the [[pieze]], equal to 1 [[sthene]] per square metre.

Many other hybrid units are used such as mmHg/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or grams-force/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (sometimes as [[kg/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]] without properly identifying the force units). Using the names kilogram, gram, kilogram-force, or gram-force (or their symbols) as a unit of force is prohibited in SI; the unit of force in SI is the newton (N).

==Static and dynamic pressure==
[[Static pressure]] is uniform in all directions, so pressure measurements are independent of direction in an immovable (static) fluid. Flow, however, applies additional pressure on surfaces perpendicular to the flow direction, while having little impact on surfaces parallel to the flow direction. This directional component of pressure in a moving (dynamic) fluid is called [[dynamic pressure]]. An instrument facing the flow direction measures the sum of the static and dynamic pressures; this measurement is called the [[total pressure]] or [[stagnation pressure]]. Since dynamic pressure is referenced to static pressure, it is neither gauge nor absolute; it is a differential pressure.

While static gauge pressure is of primary importance to determining net loads on pipe walls, dynamic pressure is used to measure flow rates and airspeed. Dynamic pressure can be measured by taking the differential pressure between instruments parallel and perpendicular to the flow. [[Pitot tube|Pitot-static tube]]s, for example perform this measurement on airplanes to determine airspeed. The presence of the measuring instrument inevitably acts to divert flow and create turbulence, so its shape is critical to accuracy and the calibration curves are often non-linear.

==Instruments==
Many instruments have been invented to measure pressure, with different advantages and disadvantages. Pressure range, sensitivity, dynamic response and cost all vary by several orders of magnitude from one instrument design to the next. The oldest type is the liquid column (a vertical tube filled with mercury) manometer invented by [[Evangelista Torricelli]] in 1643.  The U-Tube was invented by [[Christiaan Huygens]] in 1661.

===Hydrostatic===
'''Hydrostatic''' gauges (such as the mercury column manometer) compare pressure to the hydrostatic force per unit area at the base of a column of fluid. Hydrostatic gauge measurements are independent of the type of gas being measured, and can be designed to have a very linear calibration. They have poor dynamic response.

====Piston====
Piston-type gauges counterbalance the pressure of a fluid with a spring (for example [[tire-pressure gauge]]s of comparatively low accuracy) or a solid weight, in which case it is known as a [[deadweight tester]] and may be used for calibration of other gauges.

====Liquid column (manometer)====
[[Image:Utube.PNG|thumb|upright|The difference in fluid height in a liquid-column manometer is proportional to the pressure difference: &lt;math&gt;h = \frac{P_a - P_o}{g \rho}&lt;/math&gt;]]
Liquid-column gauges consist of a column of liquid in a tube whose ends are exposed to different pressures. The column will rise or fall until its weight (a force applied due to gravity) is in equilibrium with the pressure differential between the two ends of the tube (a force applied due to fluid pressure). A very simple version is a U-shaped tube half-full of liquid, one side of which is connected to the region of interest while the [[reference]] pressure (which might be the [[atmospheric pressure]] or a vacuum) is applied to the other. The difference in liquid levels represents the applied pressure. The pressure exerted by a column of fluid of height ''h'' and density ''ρ'' is given by the hydrostatic pressure equation, ''P'' = ''hgρ''. Therefore, the pressure difference between the applied pressure ''P&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' and the reference pressure ''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in a U-tube manometer can be found by solving {{nowrap|''P&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' − ''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''hgρ''}}. In other words, the pressure on either end of the liquid (shown in blue in the figure) must be balanced (since the liquid is static), and so {{nowrap|''P&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}}  ''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + ''hgρ''}}.

In most liquid-column measurements, the result of the measurement is the height ''h'', expressed typically in mm, cm, or inches. The ''h'' is also known as the [[pressure head]]. When expressed as a pressure head, pressure is specified in units of length and the measurement fluid must be specified. When accuracy is critical, the temperature of the measurement fluid must likewise be specified, because liquid density is a function of [[temperature]]. So, for example, pressure head might be written "742.2&amp;nbsp;mm&lt;sub&gt;Hg&lt;/sub&gt;" or "4.2&amp;nbsp;in&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt; at 59&amp;nbsp;°F" for measurements taken with mercury or water as the manometric fluid respectively. The word "gauge" or "vacuum" may be added to such a measurement to distinguish between a pressure above or below the atmospheric pressure. Both mm of mercury and inches of water are common pressure heads, which can be converted to S.I. units of pressure using [[unit conversion]] and the above formulas.

If the fluid being measured is significantly dense, hydrostatic corrections may have to be made for the height between the moving surface of the manometer working fluid and the location where the pressure measurement is desired, except when measuring differential pressure of a fluid (for example, across an [[orifice plate]] or venturi), in which case the density ρ should be corrected by subtracting the density of the fluid being measured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Methods for the Measurement of Fluid Flow in Pipes, Part 1. Orifice Plates, Nozzles and Venturi Tubes |date=1964 |publisher=[[British Standards Institute]] |page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although any fluid can be used, [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] is preferred for its high density (13.534&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and low [[Vapor pressure|vapour pressure]]. For low pressure differences, light oil or water are commonly used (the latter giving rise to units of measurement such as [[Inch of water|inches water gauge]] and [[Millimeters, water gauge|millimetres H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]]. Liquid-column pressure gauges have a highly linear calibration. They have poor dynamic response because the fluid in the column may react slowly to a pressure change.

When measuring vacuum, the working liquid may evaporate and contaminate the vacuum if its [[vapor pressure]] is too high. When measuring liquid pressure, a loop filled with gas or a light fluid can isolate the liquids to prevent them from mixing, but this can be unnecessary, for example, when mercury is used as the manometer fluid to measure differential pressure of a fluid such as water. Simple hydrostatic gauges can measure pressures ranging from a few [[torr]]s (a few 100&amp;nbsp;Pa) to a few atmospheres (approximately {{val|1,000,000|u=Pa}}).

A single-limb liquid-column manometer has a larger reservoir instead of one side of the U-tube and has a scale beside the narrower column. The column may be inclined to further amplify the liquid movement. Based on the use and structure, following types of manometers are used&lt;ref name=manometer_types&gt;[Was: "fluidengineering.co.nr/Manometer.htm". At 1/2010 that took me to bad link.

====McLeod gauge====
[[Image:McLeod gauge.jpg|thumb|A McLeod gauge, drained of mercury]]
A [[McLeod gauge]] isolates a sample of gas and compresses it in a modified mercury manometer until the pressure is a few [[Millimeter of mercury|millimetres of mercury]]. The technique is very slow and unsuited to continual monitoring, but is capable of good accuracy. Unlike other manometer gauges, the McLeod gauge reading is dependent on the composition of the gas, since the interpretation relies on the sample compressing as an [[ideal gas]]. Due to the compression process, the McLeod gauge completely ignores partial pressures from non-ideal vapors that condense, such as pump oils, mercury, and even water if compressed enough.

0.1&amp;nbsp;mPa is the lowest direct measurement of pressure that is possible with current technology. Other vacuum gauges can measure lower pressures, but only indirectly by measurement of other pressure-dependent properties. These indirect measurements must be calibrated to SI units by a direct measurement, most commonly a McLeod gauge.&lt;ref name=measure&gt;{{Cite book | first=Thomas G. | last=Beckwith | author2=Roy D.

===Aneroid===
'''Aneroid''' gauges are based on a metallic pressure-sensing element that flexes elastically under the effect of a pressure difference across the element. "Aneroid" means "without fluid", and the term originally distinguished these gauges from the hydrostatic gauges described above. However, aneroid gauges can be used to measure the pressure of a liquid as well as a gas, and they are not the only type of gauge that can operate without fluid. For this reason, they are often called '''mechanical''' gauges in modern language. Aneroid gauges are not dependent on the type of gas being measured, unlike thermal and ionization gauges, and are less likely to contaminate the system than hydrostatic gauges. The pressure sensing element may be a '''Bourdon tube''', a diaphragm, a capsule, or a set of bellows, which will change shape in response to the pressure of the region in question. The deflection of the pressure sensing element may be read by a linkage connected to a needle, or it may be read by a secondary transducer. The most common secondary transducers in modern vacuum gauges measure a change in capacitance due to the mechanical deflection. Gauges that rely on a change in capacitance are often referred to as capacitance manometers.

====Bourdon gauge====

[[Image:Manometer 104026.jpg|right|thumb|Membrane-type manometer]]
The Bourdon pressure gauge uses the principle that a flattened tube tends to straighten or regain its circular form in cross-section when pressurized. This change in cross-section may be hardly noticeable, involving moderate [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]]es within the elastic range of easily workable materials. The [[Deformation (mechanics)|strain]] of the material of the tube is magnified by forming the tube into a C shape or even a helix, such that the entire tube tends to straighten out or uncoil elastically as it is pressurized. [[Eugène Bourdon]] patented his gauge in France in 1849, and it was widely adopted because of its superior sensitivity, linearity, and accuracy; Edward Ashcroft purchased Bourdon's American patent rights in 1852 and became a major manufacturer of gauges.  Also in 1849, Bernard Schaeffer in Magdeburg, Germany patented a successful diaphragm (see below) pressure gauge, which, together with the Bourdon gauge, revolutionized pressure measurement in industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archivingindustry.com/Indicator/discspring.htm  ''The Engine Indicator'' Canadian Museum of Making]&lt;/ref&gt; But in 1875 after Bourdon's patents expired, his company [[Budenberg Gauge Company|Schaeffer and Budenberg]] also manufactured Bourdon tube gauges.

[[File:E Bourdons Patent Compound Gauge.jpg|thumb|An original 19th century Eugene Bourdon compound gauge, reading pressure both below and above ambient with great sensitivity.]]In practice, a flattened thin-wall, closed-end tube is connected at the hollow end to a fixed pipe containing the fluid pressure to be measured. As the pressure increases, the closed end moves in an arc, and this motion is converted into the rotation of a (segment of a) gear by a connecting link that is usually adjustable. A small-diameter pinion gear is on the pointer shaft, so the motion is magnified further by the [[gear ratio]]. The positioning of the indicator card behind the pointer, the initial pointer shaft position, the linkage length and initial position, all provide means to calibrate the pointer to indicate the desired range of pressure for variations in the behavior of the Bourdon tube itself. Differential pressure can be measured by gauges containing two different Bourdon tubes, with connecting linkages.

Bourdon tubes measure [[gauge pressure]], relative to ambient atmospheric pressure, as opposed to [[absolute pressure]]; vacuum is sensed as a reverse motion. Some aneroid barometers use Bourdon tubes closed at both ends (but most use diaphragms or capsules, see below).  When the measured pressure is rapidly pulsing, such as when the gauge is near a [[reciprocating pump]], an [[:wikt:orifice|orifice]] restriction in the connecting pipe is frequently used to avoid unnecessary wear on the gears and provide an average reading; when the whole gauge is subject to mechanical vibration, the entire case including the pointer and indicator card can be filled with an oil or [[glycerin]]. Tapping on the face of the gauge is not recommended as it will tend to falsify actual readings initially presented by the gauge. The Bourdon tube is separate from the face of the gauge and thus has no effect on the actual reading of pressure. Typical high-quality modern gauges provide an accuracy of ±2% of span, and a special high-precision gauge can be as accurate as 0.1% of full scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last = Boyes |first = Walt |title = Instrumentation Reference Book |edition = Fourth |publisher = [[Butterworth-Heinemann]] |date = 2008 |pages = 1312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following illustrations the transparent cover face of the pictured combination pressure and vacuum gauge has been removed and the mechanism removed from the case. This particular gauge is a combination vacuum and pressure gauge used for automotive diagnosis:

A small motion of the tube results in a large motion of the indicator needle.
# Hair spring to preload the gear train to eliminate gear lash and [[hysteresis]].

====Diaphragm====
A second type of aneroid gauge uses  [[Deflection (engineering)|deflection]] of a flexible [[Artificial membrane|membrane]] that separates regions of different pressure. The amount of deflection is repeatable for known pressures so the pressure can be determined by using calibration. The deformation of a thin diaphragm is dependent on the difference in pressure between its two faces.  The reference face can be open to atmosphere to measure gauge pressure, open to a second port to measure differential pressure, or can be sealed against a vacuum or other fixed reference pressure to measure absolute pressure. The deformation can be measured using mechanical, optical or capacitive techniques. Ceramic and metallic diaphragms are used.

====Bellows====
[[Image:Barograph 03.jpg|thumb|A pile of pressure capsules with corrugated diaphragms in an aneroid [[barograph]]]]
In gauges intended to sense small pressures or pressure differences, or require that an absolute pressure be measured, the gear train and needle may be driven by an enclosed and sealed bellows chamber, called an '''aneroid''', which means "without liquid". (Early [[barometer]]s used a column of liquid such as water or the liquid metal [[mercury (element)|mercury]] suspended by a [[vacuum]].) This bellows configuration is used in aneroid barometers (barometers with an indicating needle and dial card), [[altimeter]]s, altitude recording [[barograph]]s, and the altitude [[telemetry]] instruments used in [[weather balloon]] [[radiosonde]]s. These devices use the sealed chamber as a reference pressure and are driven by the external pressure. Other sensitive aircraft instruments such as [[airspeed indicator|air speed indicators]] and rate of climb indicators ([[variometer]]s) have connections both to the internal part of the aneroid chamber and to an external enclosing chamber.

====Magnetic coupling====
These gauges use the attraction of two magnets to translate differential pressure into motion of a dial pointer. As differential pressure increases, a magnet attached to either a piston or rubber diaphragm moves. A rotary magnet that is attached to a pointer then moves in unison. To create different pressure ranges, the spring rate can be increased or decreased.

===Spinning-rotor gauge===
The spinning-rotor gauge works by measuring the amount a rotating ball is slowed by the viscosity of the gas being measured.  The ball is made of steel and is magnetically levitated inside a steel tube closed at one end and exposed to the gas to be measured at the other.  The ball is brought up to speed (about 2500&amp;nbsp;[[radian|rad]]/s), and the speed measured after switching off the drive, by electromagnetic transducers.&lt;ref&gt;A. Chambers, ''Basic Vacuum Technology'', pp. 100–102, CRC Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0585254915}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The range of the instrument is 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Pa (10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Pa with less accuracy).  It is accurate and stable enough to be used as a [[secondary standard]].  The instrument requires some skill and knowledge to use correctly.  Various corrections must be applied and the ball must be spun at a pressure well below the intended measurement pressure for five hours before using.  It is most useful in calibration and research laboratories where high accuracy is required and qualified technicians are available.&lt;ref&gt;John F. O'Hanlon, ''A User's Guide to Vacuum Technology'', pp. 92–94, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2005. {{ISBN|0471467154}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electronic pressure sensors==
{{Main|Pressure sensor}}

; Piezoresistive strain gage
:Uses the [[piezoresistive]] effect of bonded or formed strain gauges to detect strain due to applied pressure.
; Capacitive
:Uses a diaphragm and pressure cavity to create a variable [[capacitor]] to detect strain due to applied pressure.
; Magnetic
:Measures the displacement of a diaphragm by means of changes in [[inductance]] (reluctance), [[LVDT]], [[Hall effect]], or by [[eddy current]] principle.
; Piezoelectric

; Optical
:Uses the physical change of an optical fiber to detect strain due to applied pressure.
; Potentiometric
:Uses the motion of a wiper along a resistive mechanism to detect the strain caused by applied pressure.
; Resonant
:Uses the changes in [[resonant frequency]] in a sensing mechanism to measure stress, or changes in gas density, caused by applied pressure.

===Thermal conductivity===
Generally, as a [[real gas]] increases in density -which may indicate an increase in [[pressure]]- its ability to conduct heat increases. In this type of gauge, a wire [[Electrical filament|filament]] is heated by running current through it. A [[thermocouple]] or [[resistance thermometer]] (RTD) can then be used to measure the temperature of the filament. This temperature is dependent on the rate at which the filament loses heat to the surrounding gas, and therefore on the thermal conductivity. A common variant is the [[Pirani gauge]], which uses a single platinum filament as both the heated element and RTD. These gauges are accurate from 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Torr to 10 [[Torr]], but their calibration is sensitive to the chemical composition of the gases being measured.

====Pirani (one wire)====
{{Main|Pirani gauge}}
A [[Pirani gauge]] consist of a metal wire open to the pressure being measured.  The wire is [[Joule heating|heated]] by a current flowing through it and cooled by the gas surrounding it.  If the gas pressure is reduced, the cooling effect will decrease, hence the equilibrium temperature of the wire will increase.  The [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] of the wire is a [[Electrical resistance#Temperature dependence|function of its temperature]]: by measuring the [[volt]]age across the wire and the [[Electric current|current]] flowing through it, the resistance (and so the gas pressure) can be determined. This type of gauge was invented by [[Marcello Pirani]].

====Two-wire====
In two-wire gauges, one wire coil is used as a heater, and the other is used to measure temperature due to [[convection]]. '''Thermocouple gauges''' and '''thermistor gauges''' work in this manner using [[thermocouple]] or [[thermistor]], respectively, to measure the temperature of the heated wire.

===Ionization gauge===
'''Ionization gauges''' are the most sensitive gauges for very low pressures (also referred to as hard or high vacuum). They sense pressure indirectly by measuring the electrical ions produced when the gas is bombarded with electrons. Fewer ions will be produced by lower density gases. The calibration of an ion gauge is unstable and dependent on the nature of the gases being measured, which is not always known. They can be calibrated against a [[McLeod gauge]] which is much more stable and independent of gas chemistry.

[[Thermionic emission]] generate electrons, which collide with gas atoms and generate positive [[ion]]s.  The ions are attracted to a suitably [[Bias (electrical engineering)|biased]] electrode known as the collector.  The current in the collector is proportional to the rate of ionization, which is a function of the pressure in the system.  Hence, measuring the collector current gives the gas pressure.  There are several sub-types of ionization gauge.
:'''Useful range''': 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; - 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; torr (roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; - 10&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; Pa)

Most ion gauges come in two types: hot [[cathode]] and cold cathode. In the [[Hot-filament ionization gauge|hot cathode]] version, an electrically heated filament produces an electron beam. The electrons travel through the gauge and ionize gas molecules around them. The resulting ions are collected at a negative electrode. The current depends on the number of ions, which depends on the pressure in the gauge. Hot cathode gauges are accurate from 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Torr to 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;10&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Torr. The principle behind [[cold cathode]] version is the same, except that electrons are produced in the discharge of a high voltage. Cold Cathode gauges are accurate from 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[Torr]] to 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Torr. Ionization gauge calibration is very sensitive to construction geometry, chemical composition of gases being measured, corrosion and surface deposits. Their calibration can be invalidated by activation at atmospheric pressure or low vacuum. The composition of gases at high vacuums will usually be unpredictable, so a [[mass spectrometer]] must be used in conjunction with the ionization gauge for accurate measurement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | editor=Robert M. Besançon | encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Physics | edition=3rd | date=1990 | publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold, New York | isbn = 0-442-00522-9 | pages = 1278–1284 | article=Vacuum Techniques}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hot cathode====
[[Image:Bayard-Alpert gauge.jpg|right|thumb|Bayard–Alpert hot-cathode ionization gauge]]
A [[Hot-filament ionization gauge|hot-cathode ionization gauge]] is composed mainly of three electrodes acting together as a [[triode]], wherein the [[cathode]] is the filament. The three electrodes are a collector or plate, a [[Electrical filament|filament]], and a [[electrical grid|grid]]. The collector current is measured in [[picoampere]]s by an [[electrometer]]. The filament voltage to ground is usually at a potential of 30 volts, while the grid voltage at 180–210 volts DC, unless there is an optional [[electron bombardment]] feature, by heating the grid, which may have a high potential of approximately 565 volts.

The most common ion gauge is the hot-cathode '''Bayard–Alpert gauge''', with a small ion collector inside the grid. A glass envelope with an opening to the vacuum can surround the electrodes, but usually the '''nude gauge''' is inserted in the vacuum chamber directly, the pins being fed through a ceramic plate in the wall of the chamber. Hot-cathode gauges can be damaged or lose their calibration if they are exposed to atmospheric pressure or even low vacuum while hot. The measurements of a hot-cathode ionization gauge are always logarithmic.

Electrons emitted from the filament move several times in back-and-forth movements around the grid before finally entering the grid. During these movements, some electrons collide with a gaseous molecule to form a pair of an ion and an electron ([[electron ionization]]). The number of these [[ions]] is proportional to the gaseous molecule density multiplied by the electron current emitted from the filament, and these ions pour into the collector to form an ion current. Since the gaseous molecule density is proportional to the pressure, the pressure is estimated by measuring the ion current.

The low-pressure sensitivity of hot-cathode gauges is limited by the photoelectric effect. Electrons hitting the grid produce x-rays that produce photoelectric noise in the ion collector. This limits the range of older hot-cathode gauges to 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Torr and the Bayard–Alpert to about 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Torr. Additional wires at cathode potential in the line of sight between the ion collector and the grid prevent this effect. In the extraction type the ions are not attracted by a wire, but by an open cone. As the ions cannot decide which part of the cone to hit, they pass through the hole and form an ion beam. This ion beam can be passed on to a:
* [[Faraday cup]]
* [[Microchannel plate detector]] with Faraday cup
* [[Quadrupole mass analyzer]] with Faraday cup
* [[Quadrupole mass analyzer]] with microchannel plate detector and Faraday cup
* [[Ion len]]s and acceleration voltage and directed at a target to form a [[sputtering|sputter gun]]. In this case a valve lets gas into the grid-cage.

====Cold cathode====
There are two subtypes of [[Cold cathode|cold-cathode]] ionization gauges: the '''Penning gauge''' (invented by [[Frans Michel Penning]]), and the '''Inverted magnetron''', also called a '''Redhead gauge'''. The major difference between the two is the position of the [[anode]] with respect to the [[cathode]]. Neither has a filament, and each may require a [[direct current|DC]] potential of about 4 [[volt|kV]]  for operation. Inverted magnetrons can measure down to 1{{e|−12}}&amp;nbsp; [[Torr]].

Likewise, cold-cathode gauges may be reluctant to start at very low pressures, in that the near-absence of a gas makes it difficult to establish an electrode current - in particular in Penning gauges, which use an axially symmetric magnetic field to create path lengths for electrons that are of the order of metres. In ambient air, suitable ion-pairs are ubiquitously formed by cosmic radiation; in a Penning gauge, design features are used to  ease the set-up of a discharge path. For example, the electrode of a Penning gauge is usually finely tapered to facilitate the field emission of electrons.

Maintenance cycles of cold cathode gauges are, in general, measured in years, depending on the gas type and pressure that they are operated in. Using a cold cathode gauge in gases with substantial organic components, such as pump oil fractions, can result in the growth of delicate carbon films and shards within the gauge that eventually either short-circuit the electrodes of the gauge or impede the generation of a discharge path.

==Dynamic transients==
When fluid flows are not in equilibrium, local pressures may be higher or lower than the average pressure in a medium. These disturbances propagate from their source as longitudinal pressure variations along the path of propagation. This is also called sound. Sound pressure is the instantaneous local pressure deviation from the average pressure caused by a sound wave. Sound pressure can be measured using a [[microphone]] in air and a [[hydrophone]] in water. The effective sound pressure is the [[root mean square]] of the instantaneous sound pressure over a given interval of time. Sound pressures are normally small and are often expressed in units of microbar.

==Calibration and standards==
[[File:Dead weight tester, Type PD23, Nagano Keiki Co., Ltd. - National Museum of Nature and Science, Tokyo - DSC07787.JPG|thumb|Dead-weight tester. This uses known calibrated weights on a piston to generate a known pressure.]]

The American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) has developed two separate and distinct standards on pressure Measurement, B40.100 and PTC 19.2.
B40.100 provides guidelines on Pressure Indicated Dial Type and Pressure Digital Indicating Gauges, Diaphragm Seals, Snubbers, and Pressure Limiter Valves.
PTC 19.2 provides instructions and guidance for the accurate determination of pressure values in support of the ASME Performance Test Codes. The choice of method, instruments, required calculations, and corrections to be applied depends on the purpose of the measurement, the allowable uncertainty, and the characteristics of the equipment being tested.

The methods for pressure measurement and the protocols used for data transmission are also provided. Guidance is given for setting up the instrumentation and determining the uncertainty of the measurement. Information regarding the instrument type, design, applicable pressure range, accuracy, output, and relative cost is provided. Information is also provided on pressure-measuring devices that are used in field environments i.e., Piston Gauges, Manometers, and Low-Absolute-Pressure (Vacuum) Instruments.

These methods are designed to assist in the evaluation of measurement uncertainty based on current technology and engineering knowledge, taking into account published instrumentation specifications and measurement and application techniques. This Supplement provides guidance in the use of methods to establish the pressure-measurement uncertainty.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6608">The '''shower-curtain effect''' in [[physics]] describes the phenomenon of how a [[shower curtain]] gets blown inward with a running shower. The problem of identifying the cause of this effect has been featured in [[Scientific American]] magazine, with several theories given to explain the phenomenon but no definite conclusion.

The shower-curtain effect may also be used to describe the observation how nearby phase front distortions of an optical wave are more severe than remote distortions of the same amplitude.

==Hypotheses ==

===Buoyancy hypothesis ===
Also called Chimney effect or [[Stack effect]], observes that warm air (from the hot shower) rises out over the shower curtain as cooler air (near the floor) pushes in under the curtain to replace the rising air.  By pushing the curtain in towards the shower, the (short range) vortex and [[Coandă effect]]s become more significant. However, the shower-curtain effect persists when cold water is used, implying that this cannot be the only mechanism at work.&lt;ref name=straight&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1369/why-does-the-shower-curtain-blow-in-despite-the-water-pushing-it-out-revisited|title=The Straight Dope: Why does the shower curtain blow in despite the water pushing it out (revisited)?|website=www.straightdope.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

See also [[Cooling tower]].

===Bernoulli effect hypothesis ===
The most popular explanation given for the shower-curtain effect is [[Bernoulli's principle]].&lt;ref name=straight/&gt;  Bernoulli's principle states that an increase in velocity results in a decrease in pressure.  This theory presumes that the water flowing out of a [[shower head]] causes the air through which the water moves to start flowing in the same direction as the water.  This movement would be parallel to the plane of the shower curtain.  If air is moving across the inside surface of the shower curtain, Bernoulli's principle says the air pressure there will drop.  This would result in a pressure differential between the inside and outside, causing the curtain to move inward.  It would be strongest when the gap between the bather and the curtain is smallest - resulting in the curtain attaching to the bather.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

===Horizontal vortex hypothesis ===
A computer simulation of a typical bathroom found that none of the above theories pan out in their analysis, but instead found that the spray from the shower-head drives a horizontal [[vortex]]. This vortex has a low-pressure zone in the centre, which sucks the curtain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://zidbits.com/2010/11/the-shower-curtain-effect/|title=What Is The Shower Curtain Effect?| date=2010-11-17| accessdate=2011-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=straight/&gt;

David Schmidt of University of Massachusetts was awarded the 2001 [[Ig Nobel Prize]] in Physics for his partial solution to the question of why shower curtains billow inwards. He used a [[computational fluid dynamics]] code to achieve the results.  Professor Schmidt is adamant that this was done "for fun" in his own free time without the use of grants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2001/10/47334|title=Shower Curtain Rises on Ig Nobels|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Coandă effect===
The [[Coandă effect]], also known as "boundary layer attachment", is the tendency of a moving fluid to adhere to an adjacent wall.&lt;ref name=straight/&gt;

===Condensation===
A hot shower will produce steam that condenses on the shower side of the curtain; lowering the pressure there.  In a steady state the steam will be replaced by new steam delivered by the shower but in reality the water temperature will fluctuate and lead to times when the net steam production is negative.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

===Air pressure===
Colder dense air outside and hot less dense air inside causes higher air pressure on the outside to force the shower curtain inwards to equalise the air pressure, this can be observed simply when the bathroom door is open allowing cold air into the bathroom.

==Solutions==
Many shower curtains come with features to reduce the shower-curtain effect. They may have adhesive suction cups on the bottom edges of the curtain, which are then pushed onto the sides of the shower when in use. Others may have magnets at the bottom, though these are not effective on acrylic or fiberglass tubs.

It's possible to use a telescopic shower curtain rod to block the curtain on it's lower part and to prevent it from sucking inside.

Hanging the curtain rod higher or lower, or especially further away from the shower head, can reduce the effect. A (convex) curved shower rod can also be used to hold the curtain against the inside wall of a tub.

A weight can be attached to a long string and the string attached to the curtain rod in the middle of the curtain (on the inside). Hanging the weight low against the curtain just above the rim of the shower pan or tub makes it an effective billowing deterrent without allowing the weight to hit the pan or tub and damage it.

There are a few alternative solutions that either attach to the shower curtain directly, attach to the shower rod or attach to the wall.

== What is Space for Life ? ==
{{Advert section|date=February 2017}}

The [[Montreal Biodome]], [[Insectarium]], [[Botanical Garden]] and [[Rio Tinto Alcan Planetarium]] invite us to rethink the ties between human beings and nature, cultivating a new way of living. Together, the four prestigious institutions form a place where nature and science are honoured. They have positioned themselves as a Space for Life and are dedicated to sharing their vast heritage and knowledge with you.

Space for Life is a place that brings together the Montreal Biodome, Insectarium, Botanical Garden and Planetarium, but it is also much more. It’s a participatory movement and a commitment to biodiversity. It is a vast project based on citizen participation and co-creation with visitors. Just like nature belongs to everyone, it is everyone’s movement. It’s a state of mind, a way of experiencing nature. It is a space we visit where we can exchange, collaborate and learn.

=== The mission ===

Through its efforts in communication, conservation, education and research, Space for Life guides humans to better experience nature.

=== Space for Life is a place ===

The Space for Life comprises the Montreal Biodome,Botanical Garden, Insectarium and Rio Tinto Alcan Planetarium. The institutions are interdependent, and designed to inspire visitors to adopt a new way of experiencing nature. They are connected by the Grande Place, a space that inspires new ways of coming together, enjoying the site, playing outside, building, interacting and experiencing everyday life.

Space for Life is the largest natural science museum complex in Canada, one of the leading tourist sites in Montréal and all of Quebec and a place with immense potential to impress and thrill visitors through nature, explain nature and encourage behaviour that is respectful of nature.

=== Space for Life is a commitment ===

Space for Life is also committed to increasing awareness of our planet’s biodiversity and encouraging people to better protect it. In fact, our four institutions have created a sustainable development charter.

By offering visitors immersive experiences combining science and emotion, the Biodôme, Botanical Garden, Insectarium and Planetarium invite us all to look at nature differently.

We have a collective commitment to nature, but also a commitment to achievement, meaningfulness and mobilization.

=== Space for Life is a movement ===

With their participatory, unifying approach that is authentic, inventive, committed and open to the world, our four institutions have joined forces to create a movement, a Space for Life; a place where people come together to create, shaped by Montrealers and visitors from around the world.

Space for Life has initiated a movement that aims to help people better understand the concept of interdependence underlying biodiversity, become aware of the services provided by nature and gradually change the way they live. Our institutions invite you to join the movement, by taking an active part and spreading the message yourself.

The Space for Life is a collective initiative encouraging Montrealers and local stakeholders to become involved and make it their own.

'''A movement to get closer to nature'''
'''A participatory, creative, historic movement'''

=== Sustainable development at Space for Life ===
At Space for Life, our approach to sustainable development informs all our decisions and actions, encouraging us to consider the inextricable connections between society, ethics, the economy and the environment.

With this goal in mind, we are committed to integrating sustainable development principles in all our activities. This includes our charter of commitment and 11 areas of focus:

*Biodiversity;
*Natural and cultural heritage;
*Environmentally responsible practices;
*Waste management;
*Natural resource management;
*Sustainable transportation;
*Ecodesign;
*Information, awareness and education;
*Governance and the workplace;
*Economic activity;
*Social engagement.

==== Major project ====


Montréal Space for Life is the largest natural science museum complex in Canada. By 2019, four major projects will have been developed, creating constantly evolving and changing spaces for life.

==== As Montreal's 375th anniversary approaches ====

The Insectarium Metamorphosis, the Biodôme Migration and two other major Space for Life projects are a legacy for Montrealers, for the planet and for future generations.

At a time when the issues the planet is facing, especially those related to the loss of biodiversity, raise the question of the relevance of our modern lifestyles, Space for Life, which is rooted in these unique institutions whose reputation and credibility are recognized both locally and internationally, has a fundamental role to play.

These two projects – characterized by their uniqueness, both in terms of architecture and design and the memorable and distinctive experiences they offer visitors – will let Space for Life truly play its role by inviting citizens to reconnect with nature and invent new ways of living. Reflecting a multidisciplinary vision wherein the architectural gesture emerges from a global creative approach, a bold architectural design will create living spaces that are permeable, ecological and evolving, while meeting the highest green building standards.

==== The Insectarium’s Metamorphosis ====

===== Winning Submission =====
Kuehn Malvezzi, Pelletier De Fontenay, Jodoin Lamarre Pratte, Dupras Ledoux and NCK

===== The project =====

'''A unique experience'''

The Insectarium will become a true biotope in which insects, plants and people can interact and take an interest in one another. In an architectural space that is both a landscape and an organism, the underground and closed spaces, water, shadow and daylight follow and play off one another along a route that plunges visitors into an immersive, sensory experience in the heart of the world of insects.

===== Technical Aspects =====

*Materials encouraging the greatest proximity with the insects (water, glass)
*New immersive space (butterfly house)
*Changes in architectural and museographic scale and perspective
*Individual experience spaces (face-to-face with insects)
*Museum functional spaces (laboratories, greenhouses, breeding facilities, offices)
*Transparent openings revealing the building’s ecological workings and the support processes for the live insects

==== Biodôme Migration ====

===== The design team =====

KANVA + NEUF architect(e)s, Bouthillette Parizeau + NCK

===== The project =====

'''A renewed experience, re-thinking the deeper meaning of the ecosystems.''' 

The Migration project will revamp the Biodôme and its scenic design, in most areas accessible to the public, to offer an innovative, participatory, immersive experience. The architects compare the Biodôme to a living organism and their concept echoes notions of cellular biology. The cell, the basic building block of life, becomes a model for structuring and shaping the building blocks of nature – ecosystems. The design team is proposing to reorganize the spaces, open up the centre of the Biodôme, and offer bold, complementary experiences.

The overall project budget is $22 million. This includes professional and project management fees, studies, construction costs, restoration, acquisition and relocation of live collections, museology, furniture, various contingencies, etc.

===== Technical Aspects =====
*A curved wall wraps around each ecosystem like a sensitive, delicate skin.
*A mezzanine with a lookout and new perspectives on all the ecosystems.
*The sub-Antarctic region will be expanded and the sub-Arctic region will become more immersive.
*The scenic design in some of the habitats will be redone, for a more immersive and moving visitor experience, appealing to the senses:
*Tropical Forest: larger numbers and more visible birds, fish and invertebrates
*Laurentian Maple Forest: visitors will be closer to the animals
*Gulf of St. Lawrence: reconfigured architecture and scenic design
*New welcoming and distinctive spaces where visitors can wander freely and intuitively.
*A grandiose main lobby, opened up and reconfigured to suit the scale of the building.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3245">'''Energy statistics''' refers to collecting, compiling, analyzing and disseminating data on commodities such as [[coal]], [[crude oil]], [[natural gas]], [[electricity]], or renewable energy sources ([[biomass]], [[geothermal power|geothermal]], [[wind power|wind]] or [[solar power|solar energy]]), when they are used for the energy they contain. [[Energy]] is the capability of some substances, resulting from their physico-chemical properties, to do [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]] or produce [[heat]]. Some energy commodities, called [[fuels]], release their [[energy content]] as heat when they [[combustion|burn]]. This heat could be used to run an [[Internal combustion engine|internal]] or [[external combustion engine]].

The need to have [[statistics]] on energy commodities became obvious during the [[1973 oil crisis]] that brought tenfold increase in [[petroleum prices]]. Before the crisis, to have accurate data on global energy supply and demand was not deemed critical. Another concern of energy statistics today is a huge gap in energy use between [[developed country|developed]] and [[developing country|developing]] countries. As the gap narrows (''see picture''), the pressure on energy supply increases tremendously.[[Image:Global energy consumption.jpg|thumb|right|525px|Global energy consumption per capita, 1950-2004]] 

The data on energy and electricity come from three principal sources:
* [[Energy industry]]
* Other industries ("self-producers")
* Consumers
The flows of and trade in energy commodities are measured both in physical units (e.g., [[metric ton]]s), and, when [[Energy accounting|energy balances]] are calculated, in energy units (e.g., [[terajoule]]s or [[Ton of oil equivalent|tons of oil equivalent]]). What makes energy statistics specific and different from other fields of [[economic statistics]] is the fact that energy commodities undergo greater number of transformations (flows) than other commodities. In these transformations energy is conserved, as defined by and within the limitations of the [[First law of thermodynamics|first]] and [[second law of thermodynamics|second]] laws of thermodynamics.

'''Stone walls''' are a kind of [[masonry]] construction that has been used for thousands of years.  The first stone walls were constructed by farmers and primitive people by piling loose field stones into a [[dry stone wall]]. Later, [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] and [[plaster]] were used, especially in the construction of [[city wall]]s, [[castle]]s, and other [[fortification]]s before and during the [[Middle Ages]]. These stone walls are spread throughout the world in different forms. One of the best example is the Cyclopean Wall in Rajgir, India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://travelnewsindia.com/cyclopean-wall-rajgir/|title=The Cyclopean Wall Rajgir|date=2017-03-07|work=Travel News India|access-date=2017-03-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Materials==
Stone walls are usually made of local materials varying from [[limestone]] and [[flint]] to [[granite]] and [[sandstone]]. However, the quality of building stone varies greatly, both in its endurance to [[weathering]], resistance to [[water]] penetration and in its ability to be worked into regular shapes before construction. Worked stone is usually known as [[ashlar]], and is often used for corners in stone buildings. [[Granite]] is very resistant to weathering, while some limestones are very weak. Other limestones, such as [[Portland stone]], are more weather-resistant.

==Dimensions==
Large structures are usually made of very thick walls, so that castles and cathedrals possess walls which may be up to 12 feet thick. They normally consist of a layered stone exterior and [[rubble]] infill.

This pressure difference holds the suction cup in contact with the surface.|The pressure on a suction cup as exerted by collisions of gas molecules holds the suction cup in contact with the surface.]]
[[File:Suction-lifter-one-cup.jpg|thumb|right|One cup suction lifter.]]

A '''suction cup''', also known as a '''sucker''', is a device or object that uses the negative [[Pressure#Fluid pressure|fluid pressure]] of air or water to adhere to [[Porosity|nonporous]] surfaces, creating a [[Vacuum|partial vacuum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/suction%20cup|title="Suction Cup" m-w.com |publisher=Merriam Webster: An Encyclopædia Britannica Company |accessdate=2012-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suction cups are peripherial traits of some animals such as [[octopus]]es and [[squid]]s, and have been reproduced artificially for numerous purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/48054-octopus-inspired-technology.html|title=Well-Armed Design: 8 Octopus-Inspired Technologies |publisher=livescience.com |accessdate= July 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory ==

The working face of the suction cup is made of elastic, flexible material and has a curved surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US2055397|title="Suction Cup" google.com |publisher=[[Google Patents]] |accessdate=2012-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the center of the suction cup is pressed against a flat, non-porous surface, the volume of the space between the suction cup and the flat surface is reduced, which causes the air or water between the cup and the surface to be expelled past the rim of the circular cup. The cavity which develops between the cup and the flat surface has little to no air or water in it because most of the fluid has already been forced out of the inside of the cup, causing a lack of pressure. The pressure difference between the atmosphere on the outside of the cup and the low-pressure cavity on the inside of the cup keeps the cup adhered to the surface.

When the user ceases to apply physical pressure to the outside of the cup, the elastic substance of which the cup is made tends to resume its original, curved shape. The length of time for which the suction effect can be maintained depends mainly on how long it takes for air or water to leak back into the cavity between the cup and the surface, equalizing the pressure with the surrounding atmosphere. This depends on the porosity and flatness of the surface and the properties of the cup's rim.

== Calculations ==
The force required to detach an ideal suction cup by pulling it directly away from the surface is given by the formula:
:&lt;math&gt;F = AP&lt;/math&gt;
where:
:''F'' is the [[force]],
:''A'' is the area of the surface covered by the cup,
:''P'' is the pressure outside the cup (typically [[atmospheric pressure]])

This is derived from the definition of pressure, which is:
:&lt;math&gt;P = F/A&lt;/math&gt;
For example, a suction cup of radius 2.0&amp;nbsp;cm has an area of &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;(0.020 m)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.0013 square meters. Using the force formula (''F'' = ''AP''), the result is
''F'' = (0.0013 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)(100,000 Pa) = about 130 [[newton (unit)|newtons]].

The above formula relies on several assumptions:
# The outer diameter of the cup does not change when the cup is pulled.
# No air leaks into the gap between the cup and the surface.
# The pulling force is applied perpendicular to the surface so that the cup does not slide sideways or peel off.

== Artificial use ==
[[File:Mobiles Navigationsgeraet Navigon im Einsatz.JPG|thumb|right|[[SatNav]] devices often ship with suction cup holders for mounting on windscreens.]]
[[File:GoPro camera mounted on car.jpg|thumb|GoPro camera attached to car with suction cup]]

Artificial suction cups are believed to have first been used in the third century, [[Anno Domini|B.C.]], and were made out of [[gourd]]s. They were used to suction "bad blood" from internal organs to the surface. [[Hippocrates]] is believed to have invented this procedure.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The first modern suction cup patents were issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office during the 1860s. TC Roche was awarded U.S. Patent No. 52,748 in 1866 for a "Photographic Developer Dipping Stick"; the patent discloses a primitive suction cup means for handling photographic plates during developing procedures. In 1868, Orwell Needham patented a more refined suction cup design, U.S. Patent No. 82,629, calling his invention an "Atmospheric Knob" purposed for general use as a handle and drawer opening means.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US52748 |title=United States Patent 52,748}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US82629 |title=United States Patent 82,629}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suction cups have a number of commercial and industrial applications:

A [[tsunami]] is defined as a series of water waves caused by the displacement of a large volume of a body of water; in the case of this article the body of water being investigated will be a [[lake]] rather than an ocean. '''Tsunamis in lakes''' are becoming increasingly important to investigate as a hazard, due to the increasing popularity for recreational uses, and increasing populations that inhabit the shores of lakes. Tsunamis generated in lakes and reservoirs are of high concern because it is associated with a near field source region which means a decrease in warning times to minutes or hours.

==Causes==
{{see also|Megatsunami|Tsunami earthquake}}
Inland tsunami hazards can be generated by many different types of earth movement. Some of  these include [[earthquake]]s in or around lake systems, [[landslide]]s, debris flow, rock avalanches, and glacier calving. Volcanogenic processes such as gas and [[mass flow]] characteristics are discussed in more detail below.

===Earthquakes===
[[File:Tsunami comic book style.png|thumb|Figure 1: Diagram showing how earthquakes can generate a tsunami.]]

Tsunamis in lakes can be generated by [[fault (geology)|fault]] displacement beneath or around lake systems. Faulting shifts the ground in a vertical motion through reverse, normal or oblique strike slip faulting processes, this displaces the water above causing a tsunami (Figure 1). The reason strike-slip faulting does not cause tsunamis is because there is no vertical displacement within the fault movement, only lateral movement resulting in no displacement of the water. In an enclosed basin such as a lake, tsunamis are referred to as the initial wave produced by coseismic displacement from an earthquake, and the [[seiche]] as the harmonic resonance within the lake.&lt;ref&gt;Ichinose .G.A, et al; 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

In order for a tsunami to be generated certain criteria is required:
*Needs to occur just below the lake bottom.
*Earthquake is of high or moderate magnitude typically over magnitude four.
*Displaces a large enough volume of water to generate a tsunami.

These tsunamis are of high damage potential due to being within a lake, making them of a near field source. This means a vast decrease in warning times, resulting in organised [[emergency evacuation]]s after the generation of the tsunami being virtually impossible, and due to low lying shores even small waves lead to substantial flooding.&lt;ref&gt;Freundt Armin et al. 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Planning and education of residents needs to be done beforehand, so that when an earthquake is felt they know to head to higher ground and what routes to take to get there.

====Lake Tahoe====
[[Lake Tahoe]] is an example of a lake that is in danger of having a tsunami due to faulting processes. Lake Tahoe in California and Nevada USA lies within an intermountain basin bounded by faults, with most of these faults at the lake bottom or hidden in glaciofluvial deposits. Lake Tahoe has had many prehistoric eruptions and in studies of the lake bottom sediments, a 10m high scarp has displaced the lake bottom sediments, indicating that the water was displaced by the same magnitude, as well as generating a tsunami. A tsunami and seiche in Lake Tahoe can be treated as shallow-water long waves as the maximum water depth is much smaller than the wavelength. This demonstrates the interesting impact that lakes have on the tsunami wave characteristics, as it is very different from ocean tsunami wave characteristics due to the ocean being deeper, and lakes being relatively shallow in comparison. With ocean tsunami waves amplitudes only increase when the tsunami gets close to shore, in lake tsunami waves are generated and stay in a shallow environment.

This would have a major impact on the 34,000 permanent residences along the lake, not to mention the impact on tourism in the area. Tsunami run-ups would leave areas near the lake inundated due to permanent ground subsidence attributed to the earthquake, with the highest run-ups and amplitudes being attributed to the [[seiche]]s rather than the actual tsunami. The reason seiches cause so much damage is due to resonance within the bays reflecting the waves where they combine to make larger standing waves. For more information see [[seiche]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Ichinose .G.A, et al; 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Lake Tahoe also experienced a massive collapse of the western edge of the basin that formed McKinney Bay around 50,000 years ago. Is thought to have generated a tsunami/[[seiche|seiche wave]] with a height approaching {{convert|330|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last=Gardner|first=J.V.|title=The Lake Tahoe debris avalanche|conference=Geological Society of Australia|booktitle=15th Annual Geological Conference |date=July 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sub-aerial mass flows===
[[subaerial|Sub-aerial]] mass flows ([[landslide]]s or rapid [[mass wasting]]) happen when a large amount of sediment becomes unstable, this can happen for example from the shaking from an earthquake, or saturation of the sediment initiating a sliding layer. This volume of sediment then flows into the lake giving a sudden large displacement of water. Tsunamis generated by sub aerial mass flows are defined in terms of the first initial wave being the tsunami wave and any tsunamis in terms of sub aerial mass flows are characterised into three zones. A splash zone or wave generation zone, this is the region were landslides and water motion are coupled and it extends as far as the landslide travels. Near field area, were the concern is based on the characteristics of the tsunami wave such as amplitude and wavelength which are crucial for predictive purposes. Far field area, the process is influenced mainly by dispersion characteristics and is not often used when investigating tsunamis in lakes, as most lake tsunamis are related only to near field processes.&lt;ref&gt;Walder J.S, et al; 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

A modern example of a landslide into a reservoir lake, overtopping a dam, occurred in Italy with the [[Vajont Dam]] disaster in 1963. Evidence exists in [[paleoseismology|paleoseismological]] evidence and other sedimentary [[core sample]] proxies of catastrophic rock failures of landslide-triggered lake tsunamis worldwide, including in [[Lake Geneva]] during AD 563.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kremer|first=Katrina|author2=Guy Simpson|author3=Stéphanie Girardclos|last-author-amp=yes|title=Giant Lake Geneva tsunami in AD 563|journal=Nature Geoscience|date=28 October 2012|doi=10.1038/ngeo1618|url=http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ngeo1618.html|accessdate=31 October 2012|bibcode = 2012NatGe...5..756K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New Zealand example====
In the event of the [[Alpine fault]] in New Zealand rupturing in the [[South Island]], it is predicted that there would be shaking of approximately magnitude eight in the lake side towns of [[Queenstown, New Zealand|Queenstown]] ([[Lake Wakatipu]]) and [[Wanaka]] ([[Lake Wanaka]]). These could possibly cause sub-aerial mass flows that could generate tsunamis within the lakes, this would have a devastating impact on the 28,224 residents ([[2013 New Zealand census]]) who occupy these lake towns, not only in the potential losses of life and property, but the damage to the booming tourism industry would take years to rebuild.

The [[Otago Regional Council]], responsible for the area, has recognised that in such an event, tsunamis could occur in both lakes.

===Volcanogenic processes===
[[File:LakeKivu satellite.jpg|thumb|Figure 2: Satellite image of [[Lake Kivu]] in Africa.]]

In this article the focus is on tsunamis generated in lakes by volcanogenic processes in terms of gas build up causing violent lake over turns, with other processes such as pyroclastic flows not accounted for, as it requires more complex modelling . Lake overturns can be incredibly dangerous and occur when gas trapped at the bottom of the lake is heated by rising magma causing an explosion and lake overturn; an example of this is Lake Kivu.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

====Lake Kivu====
[[Lake Kivu]], one of the [[African Great Lakes]], lies on the border between the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and [[Rwanda]], and is part of the [[East Africa Rift]]. Being part of the rift means it is affected by volcanic activity beneath the lake. This has led to a buildup of methane and carbon dioxide at the bottom of the lake, which can lead to violent [[limnic eruptions]].

[[Limnic eruptions]] (also called "lake over turns") are due to volcanic interaction with the water at the bottom of the lake that has high gas concentrations, this leads to heating of the lake and this rapid rise in temperature would spark a methane explosion displacing a large amount of water, followed nearly simultaneously by a release of carbon dioxide. This carbon dioxide would suffocate large numbers of people, with a possible tsunami generated from water displaced by the gas explosion affecting all of the 2 million people who occupy the shores of Lake Kivu.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.volcanolive.com/news16.htm Volcano Facts]{{dead link|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is incredibly important as the warning times for an event such as a lake overturn is incredibly short in the order of minutes and the event itself may not even be noticed. Education of locals and preparation is crucial in this case and a lot of research in this area has been done in order to try to understand what is happening within the lake, in order to try to reduce the effects when this phenomenon does happen.

A lake turn-over in Lake Kivu occurs from one of two scenarios. Either (1) up to another hundred years of gas accumulation leads to gas saturation in the lake, resulting in a spontaneous outburst of gas originating at the depth at which gas saturation has exceeded 100%, or (2) a volcanic or even seismic event triggers a turn-over. In either case a strong vertical lift of a large body of water results in a plume of gas bubbles and water rising up to and through the water surface. As the bubbling water column draws in fresh gas-laden water, the bubbling water column widens and becomes more energetic as a virtual "chain reaction" occurs which would look like a watery volcano. Very large volumes of water are displaced, vertically at first, then horizontally away from the centre at surface and horizontally inwards to the bottom of the bubbling water column, feeding in fresh gas-laden water. The speed of the rising column of water increases until it has the potential to rise 25m or more in the centre above lake level. The water column has the potential to widen to well in excess of a kilometre, in a violent disturbance of the whole lake. The watery volcano may take as much as a day to fully develop while it releases upwards of 400 billion cubic metres of gas (~12tcf). Some of these parameters are uncertain, particularly the time taken to release the gas and the height to which the water column can rise. As a secondary effect, particularly if the water column behaves irregularly with a series of surges, the lake surface will both rise by up to several metres and create a series of tsunamis or waves radiating away from the epicentre of the eruption. Surface waters may simultaneously race away from the epicentre at speeds as high as 20-40m/second, slowing as distances from the centre increase. The size of the waves created is unpredictable. Wave heights will be highest if the water column surges periodically, resulting in wave heights is great as 10-20m. This is caused by the ever-shifting pathway that the vertical column takes to the surface. No reliable model exists to predict this overall turnover behaviour. For tsunami precautions it will be necessary for people to move to high ground, at least 20m above lake level. A worse situation may pertain in the Ruzizi River where a surge in lake level would cause flash-flooding of the steeply sloping river valley dropping 700m to Lake Tanganyika, where it is possible that a wall of water from 20-50m high may race down the gorge. Water is not the only problem for residents of the Kivu basin; the more than 400 billion cubic metres of gas released creates a denser-than-air cloud which may blanket the whole valley to a depth of 300m or more. The presence of this opaque gas cloud, which would suffocate any living creatures with its mixture of carbon dioxide and methane laced with hydrogen sulphide, would cause the majority of casualties. Residents would be advised to climb to at least 400m above the lake level to ensure their safety. Strangely the risk of a gas explosion is not great as the gas cloud is only about 20% methane in carbon dioxide, a mixture that is difficult to ignite.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

===Askja===

At 11:24 PM on 21 July 2014, in a period experiencing an [[earthquake swarm]] related to the upcoming eruption of [[Bárðarbunga]], an 800m-wide section gave way on the slopes of the Icelandic volcano [[Askja]]. Beginning at 350m over water height, it caused a tsunami 20–30 meters high across the caldera, and potentially larger at localized points of impact. Thanks to the late hour, no tourists were present; however, search and rescue observed a steam cloud rising from the volcano, apparently geothermal steam released by the landslide. Whether geothermal activity played a role in the landslide is  uncertain. A total of 30-50 million cubic meters was involved in the landslide, raising the caldera's water level by 1–2 meters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frumniðurstöður rannsókna á berghlaupi í Öskju 21. júlí 2014 |author1=Jón Kristinn Helgason |author2=Sveinn Brynjólfsson |author3=Tómas Jóhannesson |author4=Kristín S.

==Hazard mitigation==
[[Hazard]] mitigation for tsunamis in lakes is immensely important in the preservation of life, infrastructure and property. In order for hazard management of tsunamis in lakes to function at full capacity there are four aspects that need to be balanced and interacted with each other, these are:

*'''Readiness''' (preparedness for a tsunami in the lake)
**Evacuation plans
**Making sure equipment and supplies are on standby in case of a tsunami
**Education of locals on what hazard is posed to them and what they need to do in the event of a tsunami in the lake
*'''Response''' to the tsunami event in the lake
**Rescue operations
**Getting aid into the area such as food and medical equipment
**Providing temporary housing for people who have been displaced.
*'''Recovery''' from the tsunami
**Re-establishing damaged road networks and infrastructure
**Re-building and/or relocation for damaged buildings
**Cleanup of debris and flooded areas of land.
*'''Reduction''' (plans to reduce the effects of the next tsunami)
**Putting in place land use zoning to provide a buffer for tsunami run ups, meaning that buildings cannot be built right on the lake shore.

When all these aspects are taken into consideration and continually managed and maintained, the vulnerability of an area to a tsunami within the lake decreases. This is not because the hazard itself has decreased but the awareness of the people who would be affected makes them more prepared to deal with the situation when it does occur. This reduces recovery and response times for an area, decreasing the amount of disruption and in turn the effect the disaster has on the community.

==Future research==
Investigation into the phenomena of tsunamis in lakes for this article was restricted by certain limitations. Internationally there has been a fair amount of research into certain lakes but not all lakes that can be affected by the phenomenon have been covered. This is especially true for New Zealand with the possible occurrence of tsunamis in the major lakes recognised as a hazard, but with no further research completed.

In [[astrobiology]], the '''Uniformity of Motive''' theory suggests that any civilization in the [[universe]] would go through similar technological steps in their development. This theory supports the idea that at some point in their history, advanced alien civilizations would use the [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] medium for communications, and thus would emit radio waves that could be detected by projects such as [[SETI]].

The fact that no artificial EM band communications have ever been detected supports the [[Fermi Principle]], which in conjunction with the Uniformity of Motive theory, and [[Occam's razor]] suggests that a civilization that uses this medium is a unique occurrence in Earth's region of the Milky Way Galaxy and perhaps the universe.

[[File:Great Exhibition, Vacuum Sugar Apparatus, HF Talbot, 1851.jpg|thumb|right|Vacuum Sugar Apparatus at [[The Great Exhibition]], 1851]]
'''Vacuum evaporation''' is the process of causing the [[pressure]] in a liquid-filled container to be reduced below the [[vapor pressure]] of the liquid, causing the liquid to evaporate at a lower temperature than normal. Although the process can be applied to any type of liquid at any vapor pressure, it is generally used to describe the boiling of [[water]] by lowering the container's internal pressure below standard [[atmospheric pressure]] and causing the water to boil at [[room temperature]].

The vacuum evaporation treatment process consists of reducing the interior pressure of the evaporation chamber below atmospheric pressure. This reduces the boiling point of the liquid to be evaporated, thereby reducing or eliminating the need for heat in both the boiling and condensation processes. In addition, there are other technical advantages such as the ability to distill other liquids with high boiling points and avoiding the decomposition of substances that are sensitive to temperature, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gutiérrez|first1=Gemma|last2=Cambiella|first2=Ángel|last3=Benito|first3=José M.|last4=Pazos|first4=Carmen|last5=Coca|first5=José|title=The effect of additives on the treatment of oil-in-water emulsions by vacuum evaporation|journal=Journal of Hazardous Materials|date=June 2007|volume=144|issue=3|pages=649–654|doi=10.1016/j.jhazmat.2007.01.090}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Food==
When the process is applied to [[food]] and the water is [[evaporate]]d and removed, the food can be stored for long periods of time without spoiling. It is also used when boiling a substance at normal temperatures would chemically change the consistency of the product, such as [[egg whites]] [[coagulating]] when attempting to [[dehydrate]] the [[albumen]] into a powder.

This process was invented by [[Henri Nestlé]] in 1866, of [[Nestlé]] Chocolate fame,{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}  although the [[Shakers]] were already using a [[vacuum pan]] earlier than that (see [[condensed milk]]).

This process is used industrially to make such food products as [[evaporated milk]] for [[milk chocolate]], and [[tomato paste]] for [[ketchup]].

[[File:Vacuum evaporation plant.jpg|thumb|Vacuum evaporation plant]]
[[File:00-vacuum-pan-sugar-factory.JPG|thumb|right|vacuum pans in a beet sugar factory]]In the sugar industry vacuum evaporation is used in the [[crystallization]] of [[sucrose]] solutions. Traditionally, this process was performed in batch mode, but nowadays continuous vacuum pans are available.&lt;ref&gt;BMA Gruppe. [http://www.bma-worldwide.com/products/sugar-and-sweeteners/vacuum-pans-batch-and-continuous-types-vkt.html Article on continuous vacuum pans.] Retrieved 21 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wastewater treatment==
Vacuum evaporators are used in a wide range of industrial sectors to treat [[Industrial wastewater treatment|industrial wastewater]].&lt;ref&gt;Condorchem Envitech. [http://condorchem.com/en/view/50-Vacuum-evaporators "Vacuum evaporators"] as a technology for industrial water-based liquid waste minimization and treatment. Retrieved 27 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It represents a clean, safe and very versatile technology having low management costs, which in most cases serves as a zero-discharge treatment system.

==Thin film deposition==
Vacuum evaporation is also a form of [[physical vapor deposition]] used in the [[semiconductor]], [[microelectronics]], and [[optic]]al industries and in this context is a process of depositing [[thin films]] of material onto surfaces.  Such a technique consists of pumping a [[vacuum chamber]] to pressures of less than 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; [[torr]] and heating a material to produce a [[flux]] of [[vapor]] in order to deposit the material onto a surface. The material to be vaporized is typically heated until its [[vapor pressure]] is high enough to produce a flux of several [[Angstroms]] per second by using an [[electrical]]ly [[resistive]] heater or bombardment by a high [[voltage]] beam.

A '''vacuum flask''' (also known as a '''Dewar flask''', '''Dewar bottle''' or '''thermos''') is an [[thermal insulation|insulating]] storage vessel that greatly lengthens the time over which its contents remain hotter or cooler than the flask's surroundings. Invented by [[Sir James Dewar]] in 1892, the vacuum flask consists of two [[wiktionary:Flask|flask]]s, placed one within the other and joined at the neck. The gap between the two flasks is partially evacuated of air, creating a near-[[vacuum]] which significantly reduces heat transfer by [[heat conduction|conduction]] or [[convection]].

Vacuum flasks are used domestically to keep [[beverage]]s hot or cold for extended periods of time and for many purposes in industry.

== History ==
[[File:Gustav R. Paalen, Double Welled Vessel 1909.png|thumb|Gustav Robert Paalen, Double Walled Vessel, 1. Patent June 27, 1908, published July 13th 1909]]
The vacuum flask was designed and invented by Scottish scientist [[James Dewar|Sir James Dewar]] in 1892 as a result of his research in the field of [[cryogenics]] and is sometimes called a Dewar flask in his honour. While performing experiments in determining the [[specific heat]] of the element [[palladium]], Dewar made a brass chamber that he enclosed in another chamber to keep the palladium at its desired temperature.&lt;ref name=Soulen&gt;{{cite journal|last=Soulen|first=Robert|title=James Dewar, His Flask and Other Achievements |journal=Physics Today|volume=49|number=3|date=March 1996|pages=32–37|doi=10.1063/1.881490
|bibcode = 1996PhT....49c..32S }}&lt;/ref&gt; He evacuated the air between the two chambers, creating a partial vacuum to keep the temperature of the contents stable. Through the need for this insulated container James Dewar created the vacuum flask, which became a significant tool for chemical experiments and also became a common household item. The flask was later developed using new materials such as [[glass]] and [[aluminum]]; however, Dewar refused to patent his invention.&lt;ref name=Soulen/&gt;

Dewar's design was quickly transformed into a commercial item in 1904 as two German glassblowers, Reinhold Burger and Albert Aschenbrenner, discovered that it could be used to keep cold drinks cold and warm drinks warm.&lt;ref name=Thermos&gt;{{cite web  |publisher=Thermos, LLC  |title=Our History

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dewar flask design had never been patented but the German men who discovered the commercial use for the product renamed it "[[Thermos L.L.C.|Thermos]]," and subsequently claimed both the rights to the commercial product and the trademark to the name. In his subsequent attempt to claim the rights to the invention, Dewar instead lost a court case to the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chemistryexplained.com/Co-Di/Dewar-James.html |title=Dewar, James - BRITISH CHEMIST AND PHYSICIST  |author=Frank A. J. L. James  |date= |work= |publisher= Advameg, Inc. |accessdate=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manufacturing and performance of the Thermos bottle was significantly improved and refined by the Viennese inventor and merchant Gustav Robert Paalen, who designed various types for domestic use, which he also patented, and distributed widely, through his Thermos Bottle Companies in the United States and Canada. The name later became a [[generic trademark|genericized trademark]] after the term "thermos" became the household name for such a liquid container.&lt;ref name=Thermos/&gt; The vacuum flask went on to be used for many different types of scientific experiments and the commercial “Thermos” was transformed into a common item. "Thermos" remains a [[registered trademark]] in some countries, but it was declared a genericized trademark by court action in the United States in 1963, since it had become colloquially synonymous with vacuum flasks in general. However, there are other vacuum flasks.

After the German glassblowers determined the commercial uses for the Dewar flask, the technology was sold to the Thermos company, who used it to mass-produce vacuum flasks for at-home use.&lt;ref name=Thermos/&gt; Over time, the company expanded the size, shapes and materials of these consumer products, primarily used for carrying [[coffee]] on the go and carrying liquids on camping trips to keep them either hot or cold.  Eventually other manufacturers produced similar products for consumer use.

== Design ==

The vacuum flask consists of two vessels, one placed within the other and joined at the neck. The gap between the two vessels is partially evacuated of air, creating a partial-[[vacuum]] which reduces heat [[heat conduction|conduction]] or [[convection]]. Heat transfer by [[thermal radiation]] may be minimized by [[silvering]] flask surfaces facing the gap but can become problematic if the flask's contents or surroundings are very hot; hence vacuum flasks usually hold contents below the boiling point of water. Most heat transfer occurs through the neck and opening of the flask, where there is no vacuum. Vacuum flasks are usually made of [[metal]], [[borosilicate glass]], [[foam]] or [[plastic]] and have their opening [[bung|stoppered]] with [[cork (material)|cork]] or polyethylene plastic. Vacuum flasks are often used as [[insulated shipping container]]s.

Extremely large or long vacuum flasks sometimes cannot fully support the inner flask from the neck alone, so additional support is provided by ''spacers'' between the interior and exterior shell. These spacers act as a thermal bridge and partially reduce the insulating properties of the flask around the area where the spacer contacts the interior surface.

Several technological applications, such as [[NMR]] and [[MRI]] machines, rely on the use of double vacuum flasks. These flasks have two vacuum sections. The inner flask contains liquid [[helium]] and the outer flask contains liquid nitrogen, with one vacuum section in between. The loss of precious helium is limited in this way.

Other improvements to the vacuum flask include the ''vapour-cooled radiation shield'' and the ''vapour-cooled neck'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cryogenicsociety.org/resources/cryo_central/history_of_cryogenics/ |title=History of Cryogenics: A Cryo Central resource from the CSA |publisher=Cryogenicsociety.org |date=2008-04-18 |accessdate=2012-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; both of which help to reduce evaporation from the flask.

== Research and industry ==
{{see also|Cryogenic storage dewar}}

In laboratories and industry, vacuum flasks are often used to hold liquefied gases (often LN2) for flash freezing, sample preparation and other processes where maintaining an extreme low temperature is desired.  Larger vacuum flasks store liquids that become gaseous at well below ambient temperature, such as [[oxygen]] and [[nitrogen]]; in this case the leakage of heat into the extremely cold interior of the bottle results in a slow boiling-off of the liquid so that a narrow unstoppered opening, or a stoppered opening protected by a [[pressure relief valve]], is necessary to prevent [[pressure]] from building up and eventually shattering the flask. The insulation of the vacuum flask results in a very slow "boil" and thus the contents remain liquid for long periods without [[refrigeration]] equipment.

Vacuum flasks have been used to house [[Weston cell|standard cell]]s and ovenized [[Zener diode]]s, along with their printed circuit board, in precision voltage-regulating devices used as electrical standards. The flask helped with controlling the Zener temperature over a long time span and was used to reduce variations of the output voltage of the Zener standard owing to temperature fluctuation to within a few parts per million.

One notable use was by Guildline Instruments, of Canada, in their Transvolt, model 9154B, saturated standard cell, which is an electrical voltage standard. Here a silvered vacuum flask was encased in foam insulation and, using a large glass vacuum plug, held the saturated cell. The output of the device was 1.018 volts and was held to within a few parts per million.

The principle of the vacuum flask makes it ideal for storing certain types of rocket fuel, and [[NASA]] used it extensively in the propellant tanks of the Saturn launch vehicles in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Cortright, Edgar. "Apollo Expeditions to the Moon." Official NASA publications. 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

The design and shape of the Dewar flask was used as a model for [[optical]] experiments based on the idea that the shape of the two compartments with the space in between is similar to the way the light hits the eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Haynes | first1 = John | last2 = Scott | first2 = Jesse | year = 1948 | title = A Method for Silvering a Dewar Flask for Optical Experiments | url = | journal = Science | volume = 107 | issue = 2777| page = 301 | doi=10.1126/science.107.2777.301| bibcode = 1948Sci...107..301H }}&lt;/ref&gt; The vacuum flask has also been part of experiments using it as the capacitor of different chemicals in order to keep them at a consistent temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Elliot | first1 = Willard | year = 1970 | title = A Spectrophotometric Dewar Flask with Integral Light Shield | url = | journal = Public Health Reports | volume = 85 | issue = 3| pages = 276–279 | doi=10.2307/4593845| pmc = 2031665}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Safety ==

Vacuum flasks are at risk of  [[Implosion (mechanical process)|implosion]] hazard, and glass vessels under vacuum, in particular, may shatter unexpectedly.  Chips, scratches or cracks can be a starting point for dangerous vessel failure, especially when the vessel temperature changes rapidly (when hot or cold liquid is added). Proper preparation of the Dewar vacuum flask by tempering prior to use is advised to maintain and optimize the functioning of the unit. Glass vacuum flasks are usually fitted into a metal base with the cylinder contained in or coated with mesh, aluminum or plastic to aid in handling, protect it from physical damage, and contain fragments should they break.{{Cn|date=November 2018}}

In addition, cryogenic storage dewars are usually pressurized, and they may explode if [[pressure relief valve]]s are not used.

== Thermodynamics ==
{{Technical|section|date=February 2017}}
The rate of heat (energy) loss through a vacuum flask can be analyzed thermodynamically, starting from the second TdS relation:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ecourses.ou.edu/cgi-bin/ebook.cgi?doc=&amp;topic=th&amp;chap_sec=06.2&amp;page=theory |title=Thermodynamics eBook: TdS Relations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;TdS = dH - VdP&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;T_{surr} \Delta S = mc_p \delta T - Vdp&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming constant pressure throughout the process,

&lt;math&gt;T_{surr} \Delta S = c_p \left ( T_{b'} - T_c \right )&lt;/math&gt;

Rearranging the equation in terms of the temperature of the outside surface of the vacuum flask's inner wall,

&lt;math&gt;T_{b'} = T_c + \frac{T_{surr} \Delta S}{c_p}&lt;/math&gt;

Where

* ''T&lt;sub&gt;surr&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the temperature of the surrounding air
* ''∆S'' is the change in specific entropy of stainless steel
* ''c&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the specific heat capacity of stainless steel
* ''T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the temperature of the liquid contained within the flask
* ''T&lt;sub&gt;b'&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the temperature of the outside surface of the vacuum flask's inner wall

Now consider the general expression for heat loss due to radiation:

&lt;math&gt;Q'_0  = A \epsilon \sigma \left ( T^4 -T_0^4 \right )&lt;/math&gt;

In the case of the vacuum flask,

&lt;math&gt;Q'_0  = A_{in} \epsilon _{s.s.} \sigma \left ( T_{b'}^4 - T_{surr}^4 \right )&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting our earlier expression for T&lt;sub&gt;b'&lt;/sub&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;Q'_0 = A_{in} \epsilon _{s.s.} \sigma \left [ \left ( T_c + \frac{T_{surr} \Delta S}{c_p} \right )^4 - T_{surr}^4 \right ]&lt;/math&gt;

Where
* ''Q'&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the rate of heat transfer by radiation through the vacuum portion of the flask
* ''A&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the surface area of the outside of the inner wall of the flask
* ''ε&lt;sub&gt;s.s.&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the emissivity of stainless steel
* ''σ'' is the [[Stefan–Boltzmann constant]]

Assuming that the outer surface of the inner wall and the inner surface of the outer wall of the vacuum flask are coated with polished silver to minimize heat loss due to radiation, we can say that the rate of heat absorption by the inner surface of the outer wall is equal to the absorptivity of polished silver times the heat radiated by the outer surface of the inner wall,

&lt;math&gt;\alpha Q'_0 = Q'_{in}&lt;/math&gt;

In order for energy balance to be maintained, the heat lost through the outer surface of the outer wall must be equal to the heat absorbed by the inner surface of the outer wall,

&lt;math&gt;Q'_{in} = Q'_{out}&lt;/math&gt;

Since the absorptivity of polished silver is the same as its emissivity, we can write

&lt;math&gt;Q'_{out} = \epsilon _{s.s.} Q'_0&lt;/math&gt;

We must also consider the rate of heat loss through the lid of the vacuum flask (assuming it is made of polypropylene, a common plastic) where there is no vacuum inside the material. In this area, the three heat transfer modes of conduction, convection, and radiation are present. Therefore, the rate of heat loss through the lid is,

&lt;math&gt;Q'_{lid} = Q'_{cond} + Q'_{conv} + Q'_{rad}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;Q'_{lid} = kA_{lid} \left ( \frac{T_b - T_{surr}}{\Delta x} \right ) + hA_{lid} \left (T_b - T_{surr} \right ) + A_{lid} \epsilon _{p.p.} \sigma \left [ \left (T_c + \frac {T_{surr} \Delta S_{p.p.}}{c_p^{p.p.}} \right )^4 - T_{surr}^4 \right ]&lt;/math&gt;

Where
* ''k'' is the thermal conductivity of air
* ''h'' is the convective heat transfer coefficient of free air
* ''ε&lt;sub&gt;p.p&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the emissivity of polypropylene
* ''A&lt;sub&gt;lid&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the outer surface area of the lid
* ''c&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.p.&lt;/sup&gt;'' is the specific heat capacity of polypropylene
* ''∆S&lt;sub&gt;p.p.&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the specific entropy of polypropylene
* ''∆x'' is the distance over which conduction across the temperature gradient takes place

Now we have an expression for the total rate of heat loss, which is the sum of the rate of heat loss through the walls of the vacuum flask and the rate of heat loss through the lid,

&lt;math&gt;Q'_{total} = Q'_{out} + Q'_{lid}&lt;/math&gt;

where we substitute each of the expressions for each component into the equation.

The rate of entropy generation of this process can also be calculated, starting from entropy balance:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta S_{system} = S_{in} - S_{out} + S_{gen}&lt;/math&gt;

Written in rate form,

&lt;math&gt;\Delta S'_{system} = S'_{in} - S'_{out} + S'_{gen}&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming a steady-state process,

&lt;math&gt;- \int \frac{dQ'}{T_{surr}} + S'_{gen} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;S'_{gen} = \frac{Q'_2 - Q'_1}{T_{surr}}&lt;/math&gt;

Since there is no heat added to the system,

&lt;math&gt;S'_{gen} = \frac{Q'_{total}}{T_{surr}}&lt;/math&gt;

There is no formal definition for the '''water-energy nexus''' - the concept refers to the relationship between the [[water]] used for [[energy production]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Spang, E. S., Moomaw, W. R., Gallagher, K. S., Kirshen, P. H., and Marks, D. H. (2014). "The water consumption of energy production: an international comparison." ''Environmental Research Letters'', 9(10), 105002.&lt;/ref&gt; including both [[electricity]] and sources of fuel such as [[petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas]], and the energy consumed to extract, purify, deliver, heat/cool, treat and dispose of water (and wastewater) sometimes referred to as the [[energy intensity]] (EI). The relationship is not truly a closed loop as the water used for energy production need not be the same water that is processed using that energy, but all forms of energy production require some input of water making the relationship inextricable.

Among the first studies to evaluate the water and energy relationship was a [[life-cycle analysis]] conducted by [[Peter Gleick]] in 1994 that highlighted the interdependence and initiated the joint study of water and energy.&lt;ref&gt;Gleick, P. H. (1994). "Water and Energy." ''Annual Review of Energy and the Environment'', 19(1), 267-299.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 the [[US Department of Energy]] (DOE) released their report on the water-energy nexus citing the need for joint water-energy policies and better understanding of the nexus and its susceptibility to [[climate change]] as a matter of [[national security]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Bauer, D., Philbrick, M., and Vallario, B. (2014). "The Water-Energy Nexus: Challenges and Opportunities." U.S. Department of Energy.&lt;/ref&gt; The hybrid Sankey diagram in the DOE's 2014 water-energy nexus report summarizes water and [[energy flow (ecology)|energy flows]] in the US by sector, demonstrating [[interdependence]] as well as singling out [[Electric power|thermoelectric power]] as the single largest user of water, used mainly for cooling. 

==  Water Used for Energy Production ==
[[File:Spang-2014-The water consumption of energy production.tif|thumb|486x486px|Figure 1. Total WCEP by energy category, 2008]]
All types of energy generation consume water either to process the raw materials used in the facility, constructing and maintaining the plant, or to just generate the electricity itself. Renewable power sources such as [[Photovoltaic solar cell|photovoltaic solar]] and [[wind power]], which require little water to produce energy, require water in processing the raw materials to build. Water can either be ''used'' or ''consumed,'' and can be categorised as fresh, ground, surface, blue, grey or green among others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Water is considered used if it does not reduce the supply of water to downstream users, i.e. water that is taken and returned to the same source (instream use), such as in thermoelectric plants that use water for cooling and are by far the largest users of water.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While used water is returned to the system for downstream uses, it has usually been degraded in some way, mainly due to thermal or chemical pollution, and the natural flow has been altered which does not factor into an assessment if only the quantity of water is considered. Water is consumed when it is removed completely from the system, such as by evaporation or consumption by crops or humans. When assessing water use all these factors must be considered as well as spatiotemporal considerations making precise determination of water use very difficult.

Spang et al. (2014) conducted a study looking at the water consumption for energy production (WCEP) internationally that both showed the variation in energy types produced across countries as well as the vast differences in efficiency of energy production per unit of water use (figure 1).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Operations of water distribution systems and power distribution systems under emergency conditions of limited power and water availability is an important consideration for improving the overall resilience of the water - energy nexus. Khatavkar and Mays (2017) &lt;ref&gt; Khatavkar, P., &amp; Mays, L. W. (2017 a) Model for the Real-Time Operation of Water Distribution Systems under Limited Power Availability. In World Environmental and Water Resources Congress 2017 (pp. 171-183). &lt;/ref&gt; present a methodology for control of water distribution and power distribution systems under emergency conditions of drought and limited power availability to ascertain at least minimal supply of cooling water to the power plants. Khatavkar and Mays (2017 b) &lt;ref&gt;Khatavkar, P., &amp; Mays, L. W. (2017). Testing an Optimization/Simulation Model for the Real-Time Operations of Water Distribution Systems under Limited Power Availability. In Congress on Technical Advancement 2017 (pp. 1-9).&lt;/ref&gt; applied an optimization model for water - energy nexus system for a hypothetical regional level system which showed an improved resilience for several contingency scenarios.

== Energy Intensity ==

=== US (California) ===
In 2001 operating water systems in the US consumed approximately 3% of the total annual electricity (~75 TWh).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Cohen, R., Nelson, B., and Wolff, G. (2004). "Energy Down The Drain: The Hidden Costs of California’s Water Supply." E. Cousins, ed., Natural Resources Defense Council&lt;/ref&gt; The California's [[State Water Project]] (SWP) and [[Central Valley Project]] (CVP) are together the largest water system in the world with the highest water lift, over 2000&amp;nbsp;ft. across the [[Tehachapi mountains]], delivering water from the wetter and relatively rural north of the state, to the [[agricultural]]ly intensive central valley, and finally to the [[arid]] and heavily populated south. Consequently, the SWP and CVP are the single largest consumers of electricity in California consuming approximately 5 TWh of electricity each per year.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 2001, 19% of the state’s total electricity use (~48 TWh/year) was used in processing water including end uses, with the urban sector accounting for 65% of this.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Klein, G., Krebs, M., Hall, V., O’Brien, T., and Blevins, B. B. (2005). "California's Water – Energy Relationship." California Energy Commission, Sacramento, California.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to electricity, 30% of California’s natural gas consumption was due to water-related processes, mainly residential water heating, and 88 million gallons of diesel was consumed by groundwater pumps for agriculture.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The residential sector alone accounted for 48% of the total combined electricity and natural gas consumed for water-related processes in the state.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

According to the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) Energy Division’s Embedded Energy in Water Studies report:&lt;blockquote&gt;''“'[[Energy Intensity]]' refers to the average amount of energy needed to transport or treat water or wastewater on a per unit basis"''&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Energy Intensity is sometimes used synonymously with embedded or [[embodied energy]]. In 2005, water deliveries to Southern California were assessed to have an average EI of 12.7 MWh/MG, nearly two-thirds of which was due to transportation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Following the findings that a fifth of California’s electricity is consumed in water-related processes including end-use,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; the CPUC responded by authorising a statewide study into the relationship between energy and water that was conducted by the California Institute for Energy and Environment (CIEE), and developed programs to save energy through water conservation.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Bennett, B., and Park, L. (2010). "Embedded Energy in Water Studies Study 1: Statewide and Regional Water-Energy Relationship." California Public Utilities Commission Energy Division.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, B., and Park, L. (2010). "Embedded Energy in Water Studies Study 2: Water Agency and Function Component Study and Embedded Energy- Water Load Profiles." California Public Utilities Commission Energy Division.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hydroelectricity ==
[[Hydroelectricity]] is a special case of water used for energy production mainly because hydroelectric power generation is regarded as being clean and [[renewable]], and dams (the main source of hydroelectric production) serve multiple purposes besides energy generation, including flood prevention, storage, control and recreation which make justifiable allocation analyses difficult.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Furthermore, the impacts of hydroelectric power generation can be hard to quantify both in terms of evaporative consumptive losses and altered quality of water, since damming results in flows that are much colder than for flowing streams. In some cases the moderation of flows can be seen as a rivalry of water use in time may also need to accounted for in impact analysis.

The '''world''' is the planet [[Earth]] and all [[life]] upon it, including [[human civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/world Merriam-webster.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423111522/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/world |date=2009-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a philosophical context, the "world" is the whole of the physical [[Universe]], or an [[ontology|ontological]] world (the "world" of an [[individual]]). In a theological context, the ''world'' is the material or the profane sphere, as opposed to the celestial, spiritual, transcendent or sacred spheres. "[[Eschatology|End of the world]]" scenarios refer to the end of human history, often in religious contexts.

The [[history of the world]] is commonly understood as spanning the major geopolitical developments of about five millennia, from the [[Cradle of civilization|first civilizations]] to the present. In terms such as [[world religion]], [[world language]], [[world government]], and [[world war]], the term ''world'' suggests an international or intercontinental scope without necessarily implying participation of every part of the world.

The [[world population]] is the sum of all human populations at any time; similarly, the [[world economy]] is the sum of the economies of all societies or countries, especially in the context of [[globalization]]. Terms such as "[[world championship]]", "[[gross world product]]", and "[[world flags]]" imply the sum or combination of all [[sovereign state]]s.

==Etymology and usage==
The [[English language|English]] word ''[[:wikt:world|world]]'' comes from the [[Old English]] ''weorold (-uld), weorld, worold (-uld, -eld)'', a compound of ''[[were|wer]]'' "man" and ''eld'' "age," which thus means roughly "Age of Man."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE588.html ''American Heritage Dictionary'' ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512075921/http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE588.html |date=2008-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Old English is a reflex of the [[Common Germanic]] ''*wira-alđiz'', also reflected in [[Old Saxon]] ''werold'', [[Old Dutch]] ''werilt'', [[Old High German]] ''weralt'', [[Old Frisian]] ''warld'' and [[Old Norse]] ''verǫld'' (whence the [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] ''[[wikt:en:veröld|veröld]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Orel, Vladimir (2003). ''A Handbook of Germanic Etymology'' Leiden: Brill. pg. 462. {{ISBN|90-04-12875-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The corresponding word in [[Latin]] is ''mundus'', literally "clean, elegant", itself a loan translation of Greek ''[[cosmos]]'' "orderly arrangement." While the Germanic word thus reflects a mythological notion of a "domain of Man" (compare [[Midgard]]), presumably as opposed to the divine sphere on the one hand and the [[chthonic]] sphere of the underworld on the other, the Greco-Latin term expresses a notion of [[creation myth|creation]] as an act of establishing order out of [[chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]].

"World" distinguishes the entire [[planet]] or [[population]] from any particular [[country]] or [[region]]: ''world affairs'' pertain not just to one place but to the whole world, and ''[[world history]]'' is a field of [[history]] that examines events from a global (rather than a national or a regional) perspective. ''Earth'', on the other hand, refers to the planet as a physical entity, and distinguishes it from other planets and physical objects.

"World" was also classically used to mean the material universe, or the cosmos: "The worlde is an apte frame of heauen and earthe, and all other naturall thinges contained in them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=R|last=Record|year=1556|title=Castle of Knowledge}} cited in {{cite book|title=The Oxford English Dictionary|at=World, sense 8|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/230262?rskey=BRZMwD|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earth was often described as "the center of the world".&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{cite book|author=Sacrobosco|title=Treatise on the Sphere|year=1230|at=trans by Lynn Thorndike, 1949|url=http://www.esotericarchives.com/solomon/sphere.htm|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130519151919/http://www.esotericarchives.com/solomon/sphere.htm|archivedate=2013-05-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term can also be used attributively, to mean "global", or "relating to the whole world", forming usages such as [[world community]] or world canonical texts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawpark.jimdo.com''World Canonical Texts'' ]&lt;/ref&gt;

By extension, a ''world'' may refer to any planet or [[heavenly body]], especially when it is thought of as inhabited, especially in the context of [[science fiction]] or [[futurology]].

''World'', in its original sense, when qualified, can also refer to a particular domain of [[human]] [[experience]].

* The ''world of work'' describes paid work and the pursuit of a [[career]], in all its social aspects, to distinguish it from home life and [[academia|academic]] study.
* The ''fashion world'' describes the environment of the designers, [[fashion house]]s and [[consumer]]s that make up the [[fashion industry]].
* historically, the ''[[New World]]'' vs. the ''[[Old World]]'', referring to the parts of the world colonized in the wake of the [[age of discovery]]. Now mostly used in zoology and botany, as in [[New World monkey]].

==Philosophy==
[[File:The Garden of Earthly Delights by Bosch High Resolution.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]'' triptych by [[Hieronymus Bosch]] ({{Circa|1503}}) shows the "garden" of mundane pleasures flanked by [[Paradise]] and [[Hell]]. 

The exterior panel shows the world before the appearance of humanity, depicted as a [[flat earth|disc]] enclosed in a [[firmament|sphere]].]]

In philosophy, the term world has several possible meanings. In some contexts, it refers to everything that makes up [[reality]] or the physical [[universe]]. In others, it can mean have a specific [[ontology|ontological]] sense (see [[world disclosure]]). While clarifying the [[concept]] of world has arguably always been among the basic tasks of [[Western philosophy]], this theme appears to have been raised explicitly only at the start of the twentieth century&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Heidegger |first=Martin |title=Basic Problems of Phenomenology |location=Bloomington |publisher=[[Indiana University Press]] |year=1982 |page=165 |isbn=0-253-17686-7 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been the subject of continuous debate. The question of what the world is has by no means been settled.

===Parmenides===
The traditional interpretation of [[Parmenides]]' work is that he argued that the everyday perception of reality of the physical world (as described in ''[[Parmenides#The Way of Opinion (doxa)|doxa]]'') is mistaken, and that the reality of the world is 'One Being' (as described in aletheia): an unchanging, ungenerated, indestructible whole.

===Plato===
In his [[Allegory of the Cave]], [[Plato]] distinguishes between forms and ideas and imagines two distinct worlds: the sensible world and the intelligible world.

===Hegel===
In [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]'s [[philosophy of history]], the expression ''Weltgeschichte ist Weltgericht'' (World History is a tribunal that judges the World) is used to assert the view that History is what judges men, their actions and their opinions. Science is born from the desire to transform the World in relation to Man; its final end is technical application.

===Schopenhauer===
''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'' is the central work of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]].
Schopenhauer saw the human will as our one window to the world behind the representation; the Kantian thing-in-itself. He believed, therefore, that we could gain knowledge about the thing-in-itself, something Kant said was impossible, since the rest of the relationship between representation and thing-in-itself could be understood by analogy to the relationship between human will and human body.

===Wittgenstein===
Two definitions that were both put forward in the 1920s, however, suggest the range of available opinion. "The world is everything that is the case," wrote [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] in his influential ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'', first published in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein/|title=Ludwig Wittgenstein|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|date=3 March 2014|accessdate=3 December 2017|first1=Anat|first2=Anat|last1=Biletzki|last2=Matar|edition=Fall 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition would serve as the basis of [[logical positivism]], with its assumption that there is exactly one world, consisting of the totality of facts, regardless of the interpretations that individual people may make of them.

===Heidegger===
[[Martin Heidegger]], meanwhile, argued that "the surrounding world is different for each of us, and notwithstanding that we move about in a common world".&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger (1982), p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; The world, for Heidegger, was that into which we are always already "thrown" and with which we, as beings-in-the-world, must come to terms. His conception of "[[world disclosure]]" was most notably elaborated in his 1927 work ''[[Being and Time]]''.

===Freud===
In response, [[Sigmund Freud]] proposed that we do not move about in a common world, but a common thought process. He believed that all the actions of a person are motivated by one thing: lust. This led to numerous theories about reactionary consciousness.

===Other===
Some philosophers, often inspired by [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]], argue that metaphysical concepts such as possibility, probability, and necessity are best analyzed by comparing ''the'' world to a range of [[possible world]]s; a view commonly known as [[modal realism]].

==Religion and mythology==

[[File:yggdrasil.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|[[Yggdrasil]], a modern attempt to reconstruct the Norse [[world tree]] which connects the [[heaven]]s, the world, and the [[underworld]].]]
[[Mythological cosmology|Mythological cosmologies]] often depict the world as centered on an ''[[axis mundi]]'' and delimited by a boundary such as a [[Oceanus|world ocean]], a [[Jörmungandr|world serpent]] or similar. In some religions, worldliness (also called carnality{{citation needed|date=October 2018}})&lt;ref&gt;Hemer, C. J. “Worldly.” Edited by Geoffrey W. Bromiley. The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia, Revised. Wm. B. Eerdmans, 1979–1988.&lt;/ref&gt; is that which relates to this world as opposed to other worlds or realms.

===Buddhism===

In [[Buddhism]], the world means society, as distinct from the [[monastery]]. It refers to the material world, and to worldly gain such as wealth, reputation, jobs, and war. The spiritual world would be the path to [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]], and changes would be sought in what we could call the psychological realm.

===Christianity===

In [[Christianity]], the term often connotes the concept of the [[fall of man|fallen]] and corrupt world order of human society, in contrast to the [[World to Come]]. The world is frequently cited alongside ''the [[flesh (theology)|flesh]]'' and ''the [[Devil]]'' as a source of [[temptation]] that Christians should flee. [[Monk]]s speak of striving to be "''in'' this world, but not ''of'' this world"—as [[Jesus]] said—and the term "worldhood" has been distinguished from "monkhood", the former being the status of merchants, princes, and others who deal with "worldly" things.

This view is clearly expressed by king [[Alfred the Great]] of England (d. 899) in his famous Preface to the ''[[Cura Pastoralis]]'':
{{quote|"Therefore I command you to do as I believe you are willing to do, that you free yourself from worldly affairs ''([[Old English]]: woruldðinga)'' as often as you can, so that wherever you can establish that wisdom that God gave you, you establish it. Consider what punishments befell us in this world when we neither loved wisdom at all ourselves, nor transmitted it to other men; we had the name alone that we were Christians, and very few had the practices."}}

Although Hebrew and Greek words meaning "world" are used in Scripture with the normal variety of senses, many examples of its use in this particular sense can be found in the teachings of [[Jesus]] according to the [[Gospel of John]], e.g. 7:7, 8:23, 12:25, 14:17, 15:18-19, 17:6-25, 18:36. For contrast, a relatively newer concept is [[Catholic imagination]].

''[[Contemptus mundi]]'' is the name given to the recognition that the world, in all its vanity, is nothing more than a futile attempt to hide from God by stifling our desire for the good and the holy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chastitysf.com/q_cm.htm Contemptus mundi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708140237/http://www.chastitysf.com/q_cm.htm |date=2011-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This view has been criticized as a "pastoral of fear" by modern historian [[Jean Delumeau]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/montfort/Handbook/Mission.htm Parish Missions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605035017/http://www.ewtn.com/library/montfort/Handbook/Mission.htm |date=2011-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Second Vatican Council]], there was a novel attempt to develop a positive theological view of the World, which is illustrated by the pastoral optimism of the constitutions ''[[Gaudium et spes]]'', ''[[Lumen gentium]]'', ''[[Unitatis redintegratio]]'' and ''[[Dignitatis humanae]]''.

====Eastern Christianity====

In Eastern Christian monasticism or [[asceticism]], the world of mankind is driven by passions. Therefore, the passions of the World are simply called "the world". Each of these passions are a link to the world of mankind or order of human society. Each of these passions must be overcome in order for a person to receive salvation ([[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]]). The process of theosis is a personal relationship with God. This understanding is taught within the works of ascetics like [[Evagrius Ponticus]], and the most seminal ascetic works read most widely by Eastern Christians, the [[Philokalia]] and the [[Ladder of Divine Ascent]] (the works of Evagrius and [[John Climacus]] are also contained within the Philokalia). At the highest level of world [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendence]] is [[hesychasm]] which culminates into the [[theoria|Vision of God]].

====Orbis Catholicus====

''Orbis Catholicus'' is a Latin phrase meaning ''Catholic world'', per the expression [[Urbi et Orbi]], and refers to that area of [[Christendom]] under [[papal supremacy]]. It is somewhat similar to the phrases secular world, Jewish world and [[Islamic world]].

===Islam===
{{Main|Dunya}}
''Dunya'' derives from the root word "dana" that means to bring near. In that sense, "dunya" is "what is brought near".&lt;ref&gt;Attas, Islam and Secularism, p.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2017}}

===Hinduism===
'''Hinduism''' is an [[Indian religion]] and ''[[dharma]]'', or a way of life,{{refn|group=note|name="definition"}} widely practised in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. It includes a number of Indian religious traditions with a loose sense of interconnection, as different from Jainism and Buddhism, and (since medieaval and modern times) Islam and Christianity. Hinduism has been called the oldest religion in the world,{{refn|group=note|See:
