'''Analytica''' is a visual software package developed by Lumina Decision Systems for creating, analyzing and communicating quantitative decision models.&lt;ref&gt;Granger Morgan and Max Henrion (1998), [http://www.lumina.com/software/ch10.9.PDF Analytica:A Software Tool for Uncertainty Analysis and Model Communication] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630125258/http://www.lumina.com/software/ch10.9.PDF |date=June 30, 2007 }}, Chapter 10 of ''Uncertainty: A Guide to Dealing with Uncertainty in Quantitative Risk and Policy Analysis'', second edition, Cambridge University Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a modeling environment, it is interesting in the way it combines hierarchical [[influence diagram]]s for visual creation and view of models, intelligent arrays for working with multidimensional data, [[Monte Carlo simulation]] for analyzing risk and uncertainty, and [[optimization]], including linear and nonlinear programming. Its design, especially its influence diagrams and treatment of uncertainty, is based on ideas from the field of [[decision analysis]]. As a computer language, it is notable in combining a declarative (non-procedural) structure for referential transparency, array abstraction, and automatic dependency maintenance for efficient sequencing of computation.

== Hierarchical influence diagrams ==
Analytica models are organized as [[influence diagram]]s.  Variables (and other objects) appear as nodes of various shapes on a diagram, connected by arrows that provide a visual representation of dependencies.  Analytica influence diagrams may be hierarchical, in which a single ''module'' node on a diagram represents an entire submodel.

Hierarchical influence diagrams in Analytica serve as a key organizational tool.  Because the visual layout of an influence diagram matches these natural human abilities both spatially and in the level of abstraction, people are able to take in far more information about a model's structure and organization at a glance than is possible with less visual paradigms, such as [[spreadsheet]]s and [[mathematical expression]]s.  Managing the structure and organization of a large model can be a significant part of the modeling process, but is substantially aided by the visualization of influence diagrams.

Influence diagrams also serve as a tool for communication.  Once a quantitative model has been created and its final results computed, it is often the case that an understanding of how the results are obtained, and how various assumptions impact the results, is far more important than the specific numbers computed.  The ability of a target audience to understand these aspects is critical to the modeling enterprise.  The visual representation of an influence diagram quickly communicates an understanding at a level of abstraction that is normally more appropriate than detailed representations such as mathematical expressions or cell formulae.  When more detail is desired, users can drill down to increasing levels of detail, speeded by the visual depiction of the model's structure.

The existence of an easily understandable and transparent model supports communication and debate within an organization, and this effect is one of the primary benefits of investing in quantitative model building.  When all interested parties are able to understand a common model structure, debates and discussions will often focus more directly on specific assumptions, can cut down on "cross-talk", and therefore lead to more productive interactions within the organization.  The influence diagram serves as a graphical representation that can help to make models accessible to people at different levels.

== Intelligent multidimensional arrays ==

Analytica uses index objects to track the dimensions of multidimensional arrays. An index object has a name and a list of elements.  When two multidimensional values are combined, for example in an expression such as

:&lt;code&gt;Profit = Revenue − Expenses&lt;/code&gt;

where ''Revenue'' and ''Expenses'' are each multidimensional, Analytica repeats the profit calculation over each dimension, but recognizes when same dimension occurs in both values and treats it as the same dimension during the calculation, in a process called ''intelligent array abstraction''.  Unlike most programming languages, there is no inherent ordering to the dimensions in a multidimensional array. This avoids duplicated formulas and explicit FOR loops, both common sources of modeling errors. The simplified expressions made possible by intelligent array abstraction allow the model to be more accessible, interpretable, and transparent.

Another consequence of intelligent array abstraction is that new dimensions can be introduced or removed from an existing model, without requiring changes to the model structure or changes to variable definitions.  For example, while creating a model, the model builder might assume a particular variable, for example ''[[discounted cash flow|discount_rate]]'', contains a single number.  Later, after constructing a model, a user might replace the single number with a table of numbers, perhaps ''discount_rate'' broken down by ''Country'' and by ''Economic_scenario''.  These new divisions may reflect the fact that the effective discount rate is not the same for international divisions of a company, and that different rates are applicable to different hypothetical scenarios.  Analytica automatically propagates these new dimensions to any results that depend upon ''discount_rate'', so for example, the result for ''[[Net present value]]'' will become multidimensional and contain these new dimensions.  In essence, Analytica repeats the same calculation using the discount rate for each possible combination of ''Country'' and ''Economic_scenario''.

This flexibility is important when exploring computation tradeoffs between the level of detail, computation time, available data, and overall size or dimensionality of parametric spaces. Such adjustments are common after models have been fully constructed as a way of exploring ''[[What-if analysis|what-if]]'' scenarios and overall relationships between variables.

== Uncertainty analysis ==

Incorporating uncertainty into model outputs helps to provide more realistic and informative projections. Uncertain quantities in Analytica can be specified using a [[probability distribution|distribution function]]. When evaluated, distributions are sampled using either [[Latin hypercube sampling|Latin hypercube]] or [[Monte Carlo simulation|Monte Carlo]] sampling, and the samples are propagated through the computations to the results.  The sampled result distribution and summary statistics can then be viewed directly ([[mean]], [[quantile|fractile bands]], [[probability density function]] (PDF), [[cumulative distribution function]] (CDF)), Analytica supports collaborative decision analysis and [[probability management]] through the use of the SIPMath(tm) standard.&lt;ref&gt;The SIPmath&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; Standard

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul D. Kaplan and Sam Savage (2011), [http://probabilitymanagement.org/library/IWM11MarApr_MonteCarlo.pdf Monte Carlo, A Lightbulb for Illuminating Uncertainty] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307150357/http://probabilitymanagement.org/library/IWM11MarApr_MonteCarlo.pdf |date=2017-03-07 }}, in Investments &amp; Wealth Monitor&lt;/ref&gt;

== Systems dynamics modeling ==

[[System dynamics]] is an approach to simulating the behaviour of complex systems over time. It deals with feedback loops and time delays on the behaviour of the entire system. The Dynamic() function in Analytica allows definition of variables with cyclic dependencies, such as feedback loops. It expands the [[influence diagram]] notation, which does not normally allow cycles. At least one link in each cycle includes a time lag, depicted as a gray influence arrow to distinguish it from standard black arrows without time lags.

== As a programming language ==

Analytica includes a general language of operators and functions for expressing mathematical relationships among variables. Users can define functions and libraries to extend the language.

Analytica has several features as a [[programming language]] designed to make it easy to use for quantitative modeling: It is a [[visual programming languages|visual programming language]], where users view programs (or "models") as [[influence diagrams]], which they create and edit visually by adding and linking nodes. It is a [[declarative programming language|declarative language]], meaning that a model declares a definition for each variable without specifying an execution sequence as required by conventional [[imperative programming language|imperative languages]]. Analytica determines a correct and efficient execution sequence using the dependency graph. It is a [[referential transparency (computer science)|referentially transparent]] [[functional programming language|functional language]], in that execution of functions and variables have no side effects i.e. changing other variables. Analytica is an [[array programming]] language, where operations and functions generalize to work on multidimensional arrays.

== Applications of Analytica ==

Analytica has been used for [[policy analysis]], [[Business Analysis|business modeling]], and [[Risk analysis (business)|risk analysi]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Jun Long, Baruch Fischhoff (2000), [http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/0272-4332.203033 ''Setting Risk Priorities: A Formal Model Risk Analysis''], Risk Analysis 20(3):339–352.&lt;/ref&gt;  Areas in which Analytica has been applied include energy,&lt;ref&gt;Stadler M., Marnay C., Azevedo I.L., Komiyama R., Lai J.

== Editions ==

The Analytica software runs on [[Microsoft Windows]] operating systems.  Three editions (Professional, Enterprise, Optimizer) each with more functions and cost, are purchased by users interested in building models. A free edition is available, called Analytica Free 101, which allows you to build medium to moderate sized models of up to 101 user objects.. Free 101 also allows you to view models with more than 101 objects, change inputs, and compute results, which enables free sharing of models for review. A more capable but non-free Power Player enables users to save inputs and utilize database connections. The Analytica Cloud Player allows you to share models over the web and lets users access and run via a web browser.

The most recent release of Analytica is version 5.1, released in May 2018.

== History ==

Analytica's predecessor, called ''Demos'',&lt;ref&gt;
Neil Wishbow and Max Henrion, "Demos User's Manual", Department of Engineering and Public Policy, Carnegie Mellon University, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; grew from the research on tools for [[policy analysis]] by Max Henrion as a PhD student and later professor at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] between 1979 and 1990.  Henrion founded Lumina Decision Systems in 1991 with Brian Arnold.  Lumina continued to develop the software and apply it to environmental and public policy analysis applications.  Lumina first released Analytica as a product in 1996.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2682">In [[mathematics]], the phrases '''arbitrarily large''', '''arbitrarily small''', and '''arbitrarily long''' are used in statements such as:

: "&amp;fnof;(''x'') is non-negative for arbitrarily large ''x''."

which is shorthand for:

: "For every real number ''n'', &amp;fnof;(''x'') is non-negative for some values of ''x'' greater than ''n''."

"Arbitrarily large" is not equivalent to "[[sufficiently large]]". For instance, while it is true that prime numbers can be arbitrarily large since there are an [[Euclid's theorem|infinite number]] of them, it is not true that all sufficiently large numbers are prime. "Arbitrarily large" does not mean "[[infinitely large]]" because although prime numbers can be arbitrarily large, an infinitely large prime does not exist since all prime numbers (as well as all other integers) are finite.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xamuel.com/arbitrary-and-infinity/ Infinitely Large vs. Arbitratily Large.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222215520/http://www.xamuel.com/arbitrary-and-infinity/ |date=2012-02-22 }} Accessed 21 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, phrases such as "P(''x'') is true for arbitrarily large ''x''" are used primarily for emphasis, as in "P(''x'') is true for all ''x'', no matter how large ''x'' is."  In these cases, the phrase "arbitrarily large" does not have the meaning indicated above but is in fact logically synonymous with "all."

To say that there are "arbitrarily long [[primes in arithmetic progressions|arithmetic progressions of prime numbers]]" does not mean that there exists any infinitely long arithmetic progression of prime numbers (there is not), nor that there exists any particular arithmetic progression of prime numbers that is in some sense "arbitrarily long", but rather that no matter how large a number ''n'' is, there exists some arithmetic progression of prime numbers of length at least ''n''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDP2e/htdp2e-part2.html 4 Arbitrarily Large Data.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222213518/http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDP2e/htdp2e-part2.html |date=February 22, 2012 }} Accessed 21 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The statement "&amp;fnof;(''x'') is non-negative for arbitrarily large ''x''." could be rewritten as:

: &lt;math&gt;\forall n \in \mathbb{R} \mbox{, } \exists x \in \mathbb{R} \mbox{ such that } x &gt; n \land f(x) \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;

Using "sufficiently large" instead yields:

: &lt;math&gt;\exists n \in \mathbb{R} \mbox{ such that } \forall x \in \mathbb{R} \mbox{, } x &gt; n \Rightarrow f(x) \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3320">[[File:Rye Castle, Rye, East Sussex, England-6April2011 (1).jpg|thumb|A square pyramid of cannonballs in a square frame]]
In the mathematics of [[figurate number]]s, the '''cannonball problem''' asks which numbers are both [[square]] and [[square pyramidal number|square pyramidal]]. The problem can be stated as: given a square arrangement of cannonballs, for what size squares can these cannonballs also be arranged into a square pyramid.
Equivalently, which squares can be represented as the sum of consecutive squares, starting from 1?

When cannonballs are stacked within a square frame, the number of balls is a square pyramidal number; [[Thomas Harriot]] gave a formula for this number around 1587, answering a question posed to him by Sir [[Walter Raleigh]] on their expedition to America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cannonball Problem |work=The Internet Encyclopedia of Science |author=David Darling |url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/C/Cannonball_Problem.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Édouard Lucas]] formulated the cannonball problem as a [[Diophantine equation]]
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{N} n^2 = M^2&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{6} N(N+1)(2N+1) = \frac{2N^3+3N^2+N}{6} = M^2&lt;/math&gt;
and conjectured that the only solutions are ''N'' = 1, ''M'' = 1, and ''N'' = 24, ''M'' = 70. It was not until 1918 that [[G. N. Watson]] found a proof for this fact, using [[elliptic function]]s.  More recently, [[elementary proof]]s have been published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Ma, D. G. |title=An Elementary Proof of the Solutions to the Diophantine Equation &lt;math&gt;6y^2=x(x+1)(2x+1)&lt;/math&gt; |journal=Sichuan Daxue Xuebao |volume=4 |pages=107–116 |year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Anglin, W. S. |title=The Square Pyramid Puzzle|jstor=2323911 |journal=[[American Mathematical Monthly]] |volume=97 |issue=2 |pages=120–124 |year=1990 |doi=10.2307/2323911}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The solution ''N'' = 24, ''M'' = 70. can be used for constructing the [[Leech_lattice#Using_the_Lorentzian_lattice_II25,1|Leech Lattice]].  The result has relevance to the [[bosonic string theory]] in 26 dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week95.html |title=week95 |publisher=Math.ucr.edu |date=1996-11-26 |accessdate=2012-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is possible to [[Squaring the square|tile a geometric square with unequal squares]], it is not possible to do so with a solution to the cannonball problem. The squares with side lengths from 1 to 24 have areas equal to the square with side length 70, but they cannot be arranged to tile it.

==Related problems==
The only numbers that are simultaneously [[triangular number|triangular]] and square pyramidal, are 1, 55, 91, and 208335.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|sequencenumber=A039596|name=Numbers that are simultaneously triangular and square pyramidal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weisstein"&gt;{{MathWorld|id=SquarePyramidalNumber|title=Square Pyramidal Number}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

There are no numbers (other than the trivial solution 1) that are both [[tetrahedral number|tetrahedral]] and square pyramidal.&lt;ref name="Weisstein"/&gt;

A '''control variable''' in [[computer programming]] is a [[program variable]] that is used to regulate the [[flow of control]] of the program.

In definite iteration, control variables are variables which are successively assigned (or bound to) values from a predetermined sequence of values.&lt;ref name="Watt"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Watt |first1=David A. |title=Programming Language Design Concepts |date=2004 |publisher=Wiley |pages=84-85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Special rules ==

In some programming languages control variables are just ordinary variables used for manipulating the program flow. This is the case of [[C (programming language)|C]], [[Fortran]], and [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], which allow for control variables to have their values changed within the loop body.&lt;ref name="Watt"/&gt; However, some languages have special rules for control variables. In [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], for instance, the control variable of the for loop must remain constant within the loop body.

{{Numeral systems}}

'''Counting rods''' ({{cjkv|t=籌|s=筹|p=chóu|j=算木|r=sangi|k=sangaji}}) are small bars, typically 3–14&amp;nbsp;cm long, that were used by mathematicians for calculation in ancient [[East Asia]].  They are placed either horizontally or vertically to represent any [[integer]] or [[rational number]].

The written forms based on them are called '''rod numerals'''.  They are a true [[positional numeral system]] with [[numerical digit|digits]] for 1–9 and a blank for 0, from the [[Warring States period|Warring states]] period (circa 475 BCE) to the 16th century.

==History==
Chinese arithmeticians used counting rods well over two thousand years ago. In 1954 forty-odd counting rods of the [[Warring States period]] (5th century BCE to 221 BCE) were found in Zuǒjiāgōngshān (左家公山) [[Chu (state)|Chu]] Grave No.15 in [[Changsha]], [[Hunan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tutorvista.com/math/ancient-china-math Ancient China Math] – Copyright © 2010 – TutorVista.com, All rights reserved.&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=March 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation| title= 中国独特的计算工具| url=http://mkd.lyge.cn/zhanzheng/a04/x3/040.htm| accessdate= 2007-12-16| deadurl= yes| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071121050945/http://mkd.lyge.cn/zhanzheng/a04/x3/040.htm| archivedate= 2007-11-21| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=March 2018}}

In 1973 archeologists unearthed a number of wood scripts from a  tomb in Hubei dating from the period of the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BCE to 220 CE). On one of the wooden scripts was written: "当利二月定算[[File:Counting rod v6.png|15px]]".{{cn|date=March 2018}} This is one of the earliest examples of using counting-rod numerals in writing.

In 1976 a bundle of [[Western Han]]-era (202 BCE to 9 CE) counting rods made of bones was unearthed from [[Qianyang County]] in [[Shaanxi]].&lt;ref&gt;Wu Wenjun ed, Grand Series of History of Chinese Mathematics, vol 1, p371&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=March 2018}} The use of counting rods must predate it;  [[Sunzi]] ({{circa}} 544 to {{circa}} 496 BCE), a military strategist at the end of [[Spring and Autumn period]] of 771 BCE to 5th century BCE, mentions their use to make calculations to win wars before going into the battle&lt;ref&gt;孫子: 夫未戰而廟算勝者，得算多也&lt;/ref&gt;; [[Laozi]] (died 531 BCE), writing in the Warring States period,{{cn|date=March 2018}} said "a good calculator doesn't use counting rods".&lt;ref&gt;老子: 善數者不用籌策。&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Book of Han]]'' (finished 111 CE) recorded: "they calculate with bamboo, diameter one fen, length six cun, arranged into a hexagonal bundle of two hundred seventy one pieces".{{cn|date=March 2018}}

At first, calculating rods were round in cross-section, but by the time of the [[Sui dynasty]] (581 to 618 CE) mathematicians used triangular rods to represent positive numbers and rectangular rods for [[negative number]]s.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

After the [[abacus]] flourished{{when?|date=March 2018}}, counting rods were abandoned except in Japan, where rod numerals developed into a symbolic notation for [[algebra]].

==Using counting rods==

Counting rods represent digits by the number of rods, and the [[perpendicular]] rod represents five.  To avoid confusion, vertical and horizontal forms are alternately used.  Generally, vertical rod numbers are used for the position for the units, hundreds, ten thousands, etc., while horizontal rod numbers are used for the tens, thousands, hundred thousands etc.  It is written in ''[[Sunzi Suanjing]]'' that "one is vertical, ten is horizontal".&lt;ref&gt;[http://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E5%AD%AB%E5%AD%90%E7%AE%97%E7%B6%93 Chinese Wikisource] 孫子算經: 先識其位，一從十橫，百立千僵，千十相望，萬百相當。&lt;/ref&gt;

Red rods represent [[positive number]]s and black rods represent [[negative number]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:zh:夢溪筆談/卷08|Chinese Wikisource]], 夢溪筆談: 如算法用赤籌、黑籌，以別正負之數。&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Chinese clearly understood negative numbers and zero (leaving a blank space for it), though they had no symbol for the latter.  [[The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art]], which was mainly composed in the first century CE, stated "(when using subtraction) subtract same signed numbers, add different signed numbers, subtract a positive number from zero to make a negative number, and subtract a negative number from zero to make a positive number".&lt;ref name=wang&gt;{{ Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E4%B9%9D%E7%AB%A0%E7%AE%97%E8%A1%93 Chinese Wikisource] 正負術曰: 同名相除，異名相益，正無入負之，負無入正之。其異名相除，同名相益，正無入正之，負無入負之。&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, a [[Go (game)|go]] stone was sometimes used to represent zero.

This alternation of vertical and horizontal rod numeral form is very important to understanding written transcription of rod numerals on manuscripts correctly. For instance, in Licheng suanjin, 81 was transcribed as [[File:Counting rod h8.png]][[File:Counting rod v1.png]], and 108 was transcribed as [[File:Counting rod v1.png]][[File:Counting rod v8.png]]; it is clear that the latter clearly had a blank zero on the "counting board" (i.e., floor or mat), even though on the written transcription, there was no blank. In the same manuscript, 405 was transcribed as [[File:Counting rod v4.png]]      [[File:Counting rod v5.png]], with a blank space in between for obvious reasons, and could in no way be interpreted as "45"[[File:Counting rod h4.png]][[File:Counting rod v5.png]]. In other words, transcribed rod numerals may not be positional, but on the counting board, they are positional. [[File:Counting rod v4.png]]      [[File:Counting rod v5.png]] is an exact image of the counting rod number 405 on a table top or floor.

===Place value===
The value of a number depends on its physical position on the counting board.  A 9 at the rightmost position on the board stands for 9.  Moving the batch of rods representing 9 to the left one position (i.e., to the tens place) gives 9[] or 90.  Shifting left again to the third position (to the hundreds place) gives 9[][] or 900.  Each time one shifts a number one position to the left, it is multiplied by 10.  Each time one shifts a number one position to the right, it is divided by 10. This applies to single-digit numbers or multiple-digit numbers.

Song dynasty mathematician [[Jia Xian]] used hand-written Chinese decimal orders 步十百千萬 as rod numeral place value, as evident from a facsimile from a page of [[Yongle Encyclopedia]]. He arranged 七萬一千八百二十四 as

::::::::::::七一八二四
::::::::::::萬千百十步
He treated the Chinese order numbers as place value markers, and 七一八二四 became place value decimal number. He then wrote the rod numerals according to their place value:

In Japan, mathematicians put counting rods on a counting board, a sheet of cloth with grids, and used only vertical forms relying on the grids. An 18th-century Japanese mathematics book has a checker counting board diagram, with the order of magnitude symbols "千百十一分厘毛“(thousand, hundred, ten, unit, tenth, hundredth, thousandth).&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Menninger (mathematics)|Karl Menninger]], Number Words and Number Symbols, p 369, MIT Press, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rod numerals==
Rod numerals are a positional numeral system made from shapes of counting rods.  Positive numbers are written as they are and the negative numbers are written with a slant bar at the last digit. The vertical bar in the horizontal forms 6–9 are drawn shorter to have the same character height.

A circle (〇) is used for 0.  Many historians think it was imported from [[Indian numerals]] by [[Gautama Siddha]] in 718,&lt;ref name="wang"/&gt; but some think it was created from the Chinese text space filler "□", and others think that the Indians acquired it from China, because it resembles a Confucian philosophical symbol for ''nothing''.&lt;ref name="qian"&gt;{{ Citation

 | first=Baocong
 | year=1964
 | publisher=Kexue Chubanshe
 | place=Beijing
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 13th century, [[Song Dynasty|Southern Song]] mathematicians changed digits for 4, 5, and 9 to reduce strokes.&lt;ref name="qian"/&gt;  The new horizontal forms eventually transformed into [[Suzhou numerals]].  Japanese continued to use the traditional forms.

In Japan, [[Seki Takakazu]] developed the rod numerals into symbolic notation for algebra and drastically improved [[Japanese mathematics]].&lt;ref name="wang"/&gt;  After his period, the [[positional numeral system]] using [[Chinese numerals#Numeral characters|Chinese numeral characters]] was developed, and the rod numerals were used only for the [[plus and minus signs]].

==Fractions==
[[File:Rod fraction.jpg|right|thumb|200px| Fraction 1/7]]
A fraction was expressed with rod numerals as two rod numerals one on top of another (without any other symbol, like the modern horizontal bar).

==Rod calculus==
{{Main|Rod calculus}}
The method for using counting rods for mathematical calculation was called ''rod calculation'' or [[rod calculus]] (筹算). Rod calculus can be used for a wide range of calculations, including finding the value of [[pi|{{pi}}]], finding [[square root]]s, [[cube root]]s, or [[Nth root|higher order roots]], and solving a [[system of linear equations]].

Before the introduction of written zero, there was no way to distinguish 10007 and 107 in written forms except by inserting a bigger space between 1 and 7, and so rod numerals were used only for doing calculations with counting rods.  Once written zero came into play, the rod numerals had become independent, and their use indeed outlives the counting rods, after its replacement by [[abacus]]. One variation of horizontal rod numerals, the [[Suzhou numerals]] is still in use for book-keeping and in herbal medicine prescription in [[Chinatown]]s in some parts of the world.

==Unicode==

{{Main|Counting Rod Numerals}}

[[Unicode]] 5.0 includes counting rod numerals in their own block in the [[Plane (Unicode)#Supplementary Multilingual Plane|Supplementary Multilingual Plane]] (SMP) from U+1D360 to U+1D37F. The [[code point]]s for the horizontal digits 1–9 are U+1D360 to U+1D368 and those for the vertical digits 1–9 are U+1D369 to U+1D371. The former are called ''unit digits'' and the latter are called ''tens digits'',&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Cullen et John H. Jenkins, [https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2004/04227-count-rod.pdf ''Proposal to add Chinese counting rod numerals to Unicode and ISO/IEC 10646''], 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is opposite of the convention described above.  Zero should be represented by U+3007 (〇, ideographic number zero) and the negative sign should be represented by U+20E5 (combining reverse solidus overlay).&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation

'''''De divina proportione''''' (''On the Divine Proportion'') is a book on [[mathematics]] written by [[Luca Pacioli]] and illustrated by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], composed around 1498 in [[Milan]] and first printed in 1509.&lt;ref name="StAnd"/&gt; Its subject was mathematical proportions (the title refers to the [[golden ratio]]) and their applications to geometry, visual art through [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], and architecture. The clarity of the written material and Leonardo's excellent diagrams helped the book to achieve an impact beyond mathematical circles, popularizing contemporary geometric concepts and images.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.georgehart.com/virtual-polyhedra/pacioli.html|title=Luca Pacioli's Polyhedra|first=George W.|last=Hart|website=Virtual Polyhedra|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Y&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.math.ubc.ca/~hoek/Teaching/Golden/Divina.html|publisher = [[University of British Columbia]]|title = The Rose and the Nautilus|last = Hoechsmann|first = Klaus Hoechsmann|date = 1 April 2001|accessdate = 15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents of the book==
{{further information|Mathematics and art}}

[[File:Divina proportione.png|thumb|250px| Woodcut illustrating proportions of the human face. Note that despite the label in the image, the lines drawn relate to Vitruvius' system of integers and do not correspond in any way to the golden ratio.]]
The book consists of three separate manuscripts,&lt;ref name="StAnd"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Pacioli.html|title = Luca Pacioli|website = School of Mathematics and Statistics|publisher = [[University of St Andrews]]|last = O'Connor|first = J J|last2 = Robertson|first2 = E F|date = July 1999|accessdate = 15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Pacioli worked on between 1496 and 1498.

===''Compendio divina proportione''===
The first part, ''Compendio divina proportione'' (''Compendium on the Divine Proportion''), studies the [[golden ratio]] from a mathematical perspective (following the relevant work of [[Euclid]]) and explores its applications to various arts, in seventy-one chapters.&lt;ref name="StAnd"/&gt; It also contains a discourse on the [[Regular polyhedra|regular]] and [[semiregular polyhedra]],&lt;ref name=E/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=J F|last=Field|title=Rediscovering the Archimedean polyhedra: Piero della Francesca, Luca Pacioli, Leonardo da Vinci, Albrecht Dürer, Daniele Barbaro, and Johannes Kepler|journal=Arch. Hist.

===''Trattato dell'architettura''===
The second part, ''Trattato dell'architettura'' (''Treatise on Architecture''), discusses the ideas of [[Vitruvius]] (from his ''[[De architectura]]'') on the application of [[mathematics and architecture|mathematics to architecture]] in twenty chapters. The text compares the proportions of the human body to those of artificial structures, with examples from classical [[Greco-Roman world#Architecture|Greco-Roman architecture]].

===''Libellus in tres partiales divisus''===
The third part, ''Libellus in tres partiales divisus'' (''Book divided into three parts''), is mainly an Italian translation of [[Piero della Francesca]]'s Latin writings ''On [the] Five Regular Solids'' ("''De quinque corporibus regularibus''")&lt;ref name="StAnd"/&gt; and mathematical examples.&lt;ref name=E&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ww3.ac-poitiers.fr/arts_p/b@lise14/pageshtm/page_4.htm |title=La Divine Proportion de Luca Pacioli |language=French |publisher=Académie de Poitiers |last=Gardes |first=Michel |date=20 June 2001 |accessdate=15 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150127090823/http://ww3.ac-poitiers.fr/arts_p/b%40lise14/pageshtm/page_4.htm |archivedate=27 January 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1550 [[Giorgio Vasari]] wrote a biography of della Francesca, in which he accused Pacioli of plagiarism and claimed that he stole della Francesca's work on perspective, on arithmetic and on geometry.&lt;ref name="StAnd"/&gt;

===Illustrations===
[[File:Leonardo polyhedra.png|thumb|250px| The first printed illustration of a [[rhombicuboctahedron]], by [[Leonardo da Vinci]].]]
After these three parts are appended two sections of illustrations, the first showing twenty-three capital letters drawn with a ruler and compass by Pacioli and the second with some sixty illustrations in [[woodcut]] after drawings by [[Leonardo da Vinci]].&lt;ref name=X&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/drawings_and_prints/divina_proportione_leonardo_da_vinci/objectview.aspx?collID=9&amp;OID=90003660|website = The Collection Online|publisher = Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York|title = Divina proportione, after Leonardo da Vinci|accessdate = 15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leonardo drew the illustrations of the regular solids while he lived with and took mathematics lessons from Pacioli. Leonardo's drawings are probably the first illustrations of skeletonic solids which allowed an easy distinction between front and back.

==History==
Pacioli produced three manuscripts of the treatise by different scribes. He gave the first copy with a dedication to the Duke of Milan, [[Ludovico il Moro]]; this manuscript is now preserved in Switzerland at the [[Bibliothèque Publique et Universitaire (Geneva)|Bibliothèque de Genève]] in [[Geneva]]. A second copy was donated to [[Galeazzo da Sanseverino]] and now rests at the [[Biblioteca Ambrosiana]] in Milan. The third, which has gone missing, was given to [[Pier Soderini]], the [[Gonfaloniere of Justice|Gonfaloniere]] of [[Florence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title=PACIOLI, Luca|encyclopedia=Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani|language=Italian|volume=80|year=2014|last=Di Teodoro|first=Francesco Paolo|publisher=Treccani|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/luca-pacioli_%28Dizionario-Biografico%29/|accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 June 1509 the first printed edition was published in Venice by [[Paganino Paganini]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title=PAGANINI, Paganino|encyclopedia=Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani|language=Italian|volume=80|year=2014|last=Nuovo|first=Angela|publisher=Treccani|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/paganino-paganini_%28Dizionario-Biografico%29/|accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has since been reprinted several times.

In [[mathematical modeling]], '''deterministic simulations''' contain no [[random variable]]s and no degree of [[randomness]], and consist mostly of equations, for example [[difference equation]]s.  These [[simulation]]s have known inputs and they result in a unique set of outputs. Contrast [[Stochastic simulation|stochastic (probability) simulation]], which includes random variables. 

Deterministic simulation models are usually designed to capture some underlying [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanism]] or natural process. They are different from [[statistical model]]s (for example linear regression) whose aim is to [[empirical]]ly estimate the relationships between [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]]. The deterministic model is viewed as a useful approximation of reality that is easier to build and interpret than a stochastic model. However, such models can be extremely complicated with large numbers of inputs and outputs, and therefore are often noninvertible; a fixed single set of outputs can be generated by multiple sets of inputs. Thus taking reliable account of parameter and model uncertainty is crucial, perhaps even more so than for standard statistical models, yet this is an area that has received little attention from statisticians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Poole|first=David|author2=Adrian E.

==Use of simulations==

Mostly are deterministic simulations used in scientific researches, we can found in various studies about populations fields, climate development, pollution, but also in another areas as engineering, chemistry and policy making. Deterministic simulations have received attention in the statistical literature under the general topic of computer experiments. Computer experiments simulate complex system which requires a number of inputs. Use of stochastic system is much cheaper but also inaccurate and simplifying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kumar |first=B.|authorlink=B. Kumar and E. S. Davidson |year=1978 |title=Performance evaluation of highly concurrent computers by deterministic simulation  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Model translation===

It is necessary to translate model into computer recognizable format. Modeler must decide if whether to program the model in a simulation language such as [[GPSS/H]] or to use special purpose simulation software:

'''Arene''' – discrete event simulator has also academic version

'''CSIM''' – CSIM is a re-usable general purpose discrete-event simulation environment for modeling complex systems of interacting elements. It contains hierarchical block diagram tools and extensive model libraries covering several domains. CSIM can be used for modeling: agent-based systems, logistics, wireless networks, computer networks...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to ATL's CSIM Modeling Environment|url=http://www.atl.external.lmco.com/projects/csim/overview.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

'''Dynare''' – when the framework is deterministic, can be used for models with the assumption of perfect foresight. The purpose of the simulation is to describe the reaction in anticipation of, then in reaction to the shock, until the system returns to the old or to a new state of equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dynare reference manual|url=http://www.dynare.org/manual/index_22.html|accessdate=26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Janus''' – Janus is an interactive simulation war game portraying realistic events during multi-sided combat. It uses digitized terrain effecting line of sight and movement, depicting contour lines, roads, rivers, vegetation and urban areas. It has the capability to be networked with other systems, in order to simulate a war game with multiple sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Use of the Janus Wargame Simulation to Investigate Naturalistic Decision-Making: A Preliminary Examination|author=Taryn Chapman |author2=Vanessa Mills |author3=Monique Kardos |author4=Christina Stothard |author5=Douglas Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Modsaf''' (Modular Semi-Automated Forces) is a set of software modules and applications used to construct Advanced Distributed Simulation (ADS) and Computer Generated Forces (CGF) applications. ModSAF modules and applications let a single operator create and control large numbers of entities that are used for realistic training, test, and evaluation on the virtual battlefield. ModSAF contains entities that are sufficiently realistic resulting in the user not being aware that the displayed vehicles are being maneuvered by computers, rather than human crews. These entities, which include ground and air vehicles, dismounted infantry (DI), missiles, and dynamic structures, can interact with each other and with manned individual entity simulators to support training, combat development experiments, and test of evaluation studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ModSAF (Modular Semi-Automated Forces)|url=http://www.aiai.ed.ac.uk/~arpi/SUO/MODULES/modsaf.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Taylor Enterprise Dynamics''' is an objectoriented software system used to model, simulate, visualize, and monitor dynamic-flow process activities and systems. With Taylor ED’s [[open architecture]], software users can access standard libraries of atoms to build models. Atoms are Taylor ED’s smart objects  and model building resources. In addition to Taylor ED’s standard atom libraries, users can create new atoms themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hullinger |first=Roger|title=Taylor Enterprise Dynamics |url=http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc01papers/033.PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Example of deterministic simulations===

'''Performance evaluation of highly concurrent computers B. Kumar and E. S. Davidson Object of the simulation is CPU memory subsystem IBM 360/91.''' 

Simulation is presented as a practical technique for performance evaluation of alternative configurations of highly concurrent computers. A technique is described for constructing a detailed deterministic simulation model of a system. In the model a control stream replaces the instruction and data streams of the real system. Simulation of the system model yields the timing and resource usage statistics needed for performance evaluation, without the necessity of emulating the system. As a case study, the implementation of a simulator of a model of the CPUmemory subsystem of the IBM 360/91 is described.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kumar |first=B.|authorlink=B. Kumar and E. S. Davidson |year=1978 |title=Performance evaluation of highly concurrent computers by deterministic simulation  }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''A comparison of deterministic vs stochastic simulation models for assessing adaptive information management techniques over disadvantaged tactical communication networks – Dr. Allan Gibb Mr. Jean-Claude St-Jacques'''

Use of a deterministic battlefield model based on a scripted scenario will provide the required
reproducibility and full control over event sequencing. A stochastic battlefield model, as provided in computer simulation applications like JANUS and ModSAF, produces results that can be made strictly reproducible if the same random number seed can be employed. However, such a model will not provide full human control over scenario composition and event sequencing. A deterministic battlefield model offers clear advantages for the test bed studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gibb|first=Allan |author2=Jean-Claude St-Jacques |author3=Gerard Nourry |author4=Tim Johnson|title=A Comparison of Deterministic vs Stochastic Simulation Models for Assessing Adaptive Information Management Techniques over Disadvantaged Tactical Communication Networks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2765">[[File:Dowker-notation-example.svg|thumb|200px|A knot diagram with crossings labelled for a Dowker sequence]]

In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] field of [[knot theory]], the '''Dowker notation''', also called the '''Dowker&amp;ndash;Thistlethwaite notation''' or code, for a [[knot (mathematics)|knot]] is a sequence of even [[integer]]s.  The notation is named after [[Clifford Hugh Dowker]] and [[Morwen Thistlethwaite]], who refined a notation originally due to [[Peter Guthrie Tait]]. 

==Overview==
To generate the Dowker notation, traverse the knot using an arbitrary starting point and direction. Label each of the n crossings with the numbers 1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;2''n'' in order of traversal (each crossing is visited and labelled twice), with the following modification: if the label is an even number and the strand followed crosses over at the crossing, then change the sign on the label to be a negative. When finished, each crossing will be labelled a pair of integers, one even and one odd. The Dowker notation is the sequence of even integer labels associated with the labels 1,&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;2''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 in turn.

For example, a [[knot diagram]] may have crossings labelled with the pairs (1,&amp;nbsp;6) (3,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;12) (5,&amp;nbsp;2) (7,&amp;nbsp;8) (9,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;4) and (11,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;10). The Dowker notation for this labelling is the sequence: 6&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;12&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;8&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;4&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;10.

A knot can be recovered from a Dowker sequence, but the recovered knot may differ from the original by being a reflection or (more generally) by having any [[connected sum]] component reflected in the line between its entry/exit points &amp;ndash; the Dowker notation is unchanged by these reflections. Knots tabulations typically consider only [[prime knot]]s and disregard [[chirality]], so this ambiguity does not affect the tabulation.

The [[ménage problem]], posed by Tait, concerns counting the number of different number sequences possible in this notation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="56812">A person's '''Erdős–Bacon number''' is the sum of one's [[Erdős number]]—which measures the "collaborative distance" in authoring academic papers between that person and Hungarian mathematician [[Paul Erdős]]—and one's [[Bacon number]]—which represents the number of links, through roles in films, by which the individual is separated from American actor [[Kevin Bacon]].&lt;ref name=Singh2002&gt;{{cite news |first=Simon |last=Singh |authorlink=Simon Singh |title=And the winner tonight is |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/4768389/And-the-winner-tonight-is.html |work=The Telegraph |date=May 1, 2002 |accessdate=September 26, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112081753/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/4768389/And-the-winner-tonight-is.html |archivedate=November 12, 2012 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=USAToday20070814&gt;{{cite news |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/printedition/life/20070814/bl_cover14_side.art.htm |title=There's not much separating her from Bacon, Erdos |work=[[USA Today]] |date=August 14, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104060408/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/printedition/life/20070814/bl_cover14_side.art.htm |archivedate=November 4, 2012 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lower the number, the closer a person is to Erdős and Bacon, which reflects a [[small world phenomenon]] in academia and entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/30835 |year=1998 |last1=Collins |first1=James J. |last2=Chow |first2=Carson C. |journal=Nature |volume=393 |issue=6684 |pages=409–10 |pmid=9623993 |title=It's a small world|bibcode=1998Natur.393..409C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The combined Erdős/Bacon [sic]&lt;!-- was originally written with a slash --&gt; number was introduced by mathematicians Tim Hsu and David Grabiner sometime before late-January 1999, when they pointed out that [[Daniel Kleitman]] has a combined number of 3: a Bacon number of 2 and Erdős number of 1.&lt;ref name="enp1999"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acs.oakland.edu/~grossman/Erdoshp.html |title=The Erdös Number Project |first=Jerry |last=Grossman |date=January 27, 1999 |publisher=Oakland University |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990203155656/http://www.acs.oakland.edu/~grossman/Erdoshp.html |archivedate=1999-02-03}}. Current version at {{cite web |url=http://www.oakland.edu/enp |title=The Erdös Number Project |publisher=Oakland University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To have a defined Erdős–Bacon number, it is necessary to have both appeared in a film and co-authored an academic paper, although this in and of itself is not sufficient.
&lt;!--Paul Erdős has an Erdős–Bacon number of 3, having a Bacon number of 3 and an Erdős number of 0. He appeared in ''[[N is a Number: A Portrait of Paul Erdős]]'' alongside [[Ronald Graham]], who was in ''[[Director's Cut (film)|Director's Cut]]''{{dubious|date=March 2018}}--&gt;&lt;!--Whatever IMDb might say, I am by no means convinced that renowned mathematician [[Ronald Graham]] took time out to appear in a low-budget horror movie--&gt;&lt;!-- (2016) with Dave Johnson,&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name |id=nm3083308 |name=Dave Johnson (XXVII)}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was in ''[[Frost/Nixon (film)|Frost/Nixon]]'' with [[Kevin Bacon]].--&gt;&lt;!--Removed until a better/non-OR source is found for Erdős' Bacon number.--&gt;

==Reckoning of time among other entities==
[[File:Time Units in Hindu Cosmology.png|frame|Relationship between various time units in Hindu cosmology]]

===Among the Pitṛs (''forefathers'')===

* 1 day of pitras = 1 solar ''masa'' (month) &lt;ref name="S.V. Gupta 6"/&gt;
* 30 days of pitras = 1 month of pitras&lt;ref name="S.V. Gupta 6"/&gt;
* 12 months of pitras = 1 year of pitras&lt;ref name="S.V. Gupta 6"/&gt;
The Lifespan of the pitras is 100 years of pitras (3,000 Solar years).&lt;ref name="S.V. Gupta 6"/&gt;

===Among the Devas===

The life span of any Hindu [[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]] spans nearly (or more than) 4.5&amp;nbsp;million years. Statistically, we can also look it as:
* 12000 Deva Years = Life Span of Devas = 1 Mahā-Yuga.&lt;ref name="Hans Kng 50"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=sm0BfUKwct0C&amp;pg=PA50&amp;lpg=PA50&amp;dq=4,000+%2B+400+%2B+400+%3D+4,800+divine+years+(%3D+1,728,000+human+years)&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4ICDiER4Wy&amp;sig=mvB9BIjm8SmryEb0nKku0olSyoQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjA6uHlktHVAhUGP48KHcKDDXQQ6AEIRDAI#v=onepage&amp;q=4%2C000%20%2B%20400%20%2B%20400%20%3D%204%2C800%20divine%20years%20(%3D%201%2C728%2C000%20human%20years)&amp;f=false|title=Tracing The Way: Spiritual Dimensions of the World Religions|publisher=[[A&amp;C Black]]|page=50|author=Hans Kng}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vishnu Purana|{{IAST|Viṣṇu Purāṇa}}]] Time measurement section of the [[Vishnu Purana|{{IAST|Viṣṇu Purāṇa}}]] Book I Chapter III explains the above as follows:
* 2 Ayanas (6-month periods, see above) = 1 human year or 1 day of the devas
* 4,000 + 400 + 400 = 4,800 divine years (= 1,728,000 human years) = 1 [[Satya Yuga]]&lt;ref name="Hans Kng 50"/&gt;
* 3,000 + 300 + 300 = 3,600 divine years (= 1,296,000 human years) = 1 [[Treta Yuga]]&lt;ref name="Hans Kng 50"/&gt;
* 2,000 + 200 + 200 = 2,400 divine years (= 864,000 human years) = 1 [[Dvapara Yuga]]&lt;ref name="Hans Kng 50"/&gt;
* 1,000 + 100 + 100 = 1,200 divine years (= 432,000 human years) = 1 [[Kali Yuga]]&lt;ref name="Hans Kng 50"/&gt;
* 12,000 divine year = 4 Yugas (= 4,320,000 human years) = 1 Mahā-Yuga (also is equaled to 12000 Daiva (divine) Yuga)&lt;ref name="Hans Kng 50"/&gt;
* [2*12,000 = 24,000 divine year = 12000 revolutions of sun around its dual]&lt;ref name="Hans Kng 50"/&gt;

===For Brahma===
* 1000 Mahā-Yugas = 1 Kalpa = 1 day (day only) of Brahma
(2 ''Kalpas'' constitute a day and night of Brahma, 8.64&amp;nbsp;billion human years)
* 30 days of Brahma = 1 month of Brahma (259.2&amp;nbsp;billion human years)
* 12 months of Brahma = 1 year of Brahma (3.1104&amp;nbsp;trillion human years)
* 50 years of Brahma = 1 Parārdha (156,764,160,000,000 human years)
* 2 parardhas = 100 years of Brahma = 1 Para = 1 Mahā-Kalpa (the lifespan of Brahma) (313,528,320,000,000 human years)

One day of Brahma is divided into 1000 parts called ''charaṇas''.&lt;ref name="Bryan E. Penprase 182"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=pQHNDgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Power of Stars|publisher=Springer|page=182|author=Bryan E.

&lt;/timeline&gt;

The cycle repeats itself, so altogether there are 1,000 cycles of Mahā-Yuga in one day of Brahma.

:*One cycle of the above four ''Yuga''s is one '''Mahā-Yuga''' (4.32&amp;nbsp;million [[solar year]]s)
:*as is confirmed by the Gītā Śloka 8.17 (statement) "sahasra-yuga-paryantam ahar yad brahmaṇo viduḥ rātriṁ yuga-sahasrāntāṁ te 'ho-rātra-vido janāḥ", meaning, a day of brahma is of 1000 Mahā-Yuga. Thus a day of Brahma, Kalpa, is of duration: 4.32 billion solar years. Two ''Kalpa''s constitute a day and night (Adhi Sandhi) of [[Brahma (god)|Brahma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.holy-bhagavad-gita.org/chapter/8/verse/17|title=Bhagavad Gita The Song of God|author=Swami Mukundananda}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:*A ''Manvantara'' consists of 71 Mahā-Yuga (306,720,000 solar years). Each Manvantara is ruled by a Manu.&lt;ref name="Bryan E. Penprase 182"/&gt;
:*After each Manvantara follows one ''[[Sandhi|{{IAST|Saṃdhi}}]] Kāla'' of the same duration as a ''Kṛta Yuga'' (1,728,000 = 4 Charaṇas). (It is said that during a [[Sandhi|{{IAST|Saṃdhi}}]] Kāla, the entire earth is submerged in water.)&lt;ref name="Bryan E. Penprase 182"/&gt;
:*A ''[[Kalpa (aeon)|Kalpa]]'' consists of a period of 4.32 Billion solar years followed by 14 Manvataras and [[Sandhi|{{IAST|Saṃdhi}}]] Kalas.&lt;ref name="Bryan E. Penprase 182"/&gt;
:* A day of Brahma equals
::(14 times 71 Mahā-Yuga) + (15 × 4 Charaṇas)
::= 994 Mahā-Yuga  +  (15 * 4800)
::= 994 Mahā-Yuga + (72,000 years)[deva years] / 6 = 12,000[deva years] viz. one maha yuga.
::= 994 Mahā-Yuga + 6 Mahā-Yuga
::= 1,000 Mahā-Yuga.&lt;ref name="Bryan E. Penprase 182"/&gt;

==Current date==

Currently, 50 years of Brahma have elapsed. The last Kalpa at the end of the 50th year is called Padma Kalpa. We are currently in the first 'day' of the 51st year.&lt;ref&gt;Burgess, Chapter 1, Verse 21&lt;/ref&gt; This Brahma's day, Kalpa is named as Shveta-Varaha Kalpa. Within this Day, six Manvantaras have already elapsed&lt;ref name="Burgess, Chapter 1, Verse 22"&gt;Burgess, Chapter 1, Verse 22&lt;/ref&gt; and this is the seventh Manvantara, named as – Vaivasvatha Manvantara (or Sraddhadeva Manvantara). Within the Vaivasvatha Manvantara, 27 Mahayugas&lt;ref name="Burgess, Chapter 1, Verse 22"/&gt; (4 Yugas together is a Mahayuga), and the Krita,&lt;ref&gt;Burgess, Chapter 1, Verse 23&lt;/ref&gt; Treta and Dwapara Yugas of the 28th Mahayuga have elapsed. This Kaliyuga is in the 28th Mahayuga. This Kaliyuga began in the year 3102 BCE in the proleptic Julian Calendar.&lt;ref name="Burgess, p17"&gt;Burgess, p17&lt;/ref&gt; Since 50 years of Brahma have already elapsed, this is the second Parardha, also called as Dvithiya Parardha.
 
===Calculating the elapsed time since current Brahma's creation===
 
432000 × 10 × 1000 × 2 = 8.64&amp;nbsp;billion years (2 Kalpa (day and night))
 
8.64 × 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; × 30 × 12 = 3.1104 Trillion Years (1 year of Brahma)&lt;br /&gt;3.1104 × 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; × 50 = 155.52&amp;nbsp;trillion years (50 years of Brahma)
 
(6 × 71 × 4320000) + 7 × 1.728 × 10^6 = 1852416000 years elapsed in first six Manvataras, and Sandhi Kalas in the current [[Kalpa (aeon)|Kalpa]]
 
27 × 4320000 = 116640000 years elapsed in first 27 Mahayugas of the current Manvantara
 
1.728 × 10^6 + 1.296 × 10^6 + 864000 = 3888000 years elapsed in current Mahayuga
 
3102 + 2017 = 5119 years elapsed in current Kaliyuga.
 
So the total time elapsed since current Brahma is
 
155520000000000 + 1852416000 + 116640000 + 3888000 + 5119 = '''''155,521,972,949,120 years'''''

(one hundred fifty-five trillion, five hundred twenty-one billion, nine hundred seventy-two million, nine hundred forty-nine thousand, one hundred twenty years) as of 2018 AD

Total age of Brahma is 100 (Brahma Years) which is equal to '''''311,040,000,000,000 Human years'''''
 
The current Kali Yuga began at midnight 17 February / 18 February in 3102 BCE in the [[proleptic Julian calendar]].&lt;ref&gt;Burgess, Ebenezer [https://books.google.com/books?id=jpE7AAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover ''Translation of the Sûrya-Siddhânta: A text-book of Hindu astronomy, with notes and an appendix''] Originally published: ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' '''6''' (1860) 141–498 , p17"&lt;/ref&gt; As per the information above about Yuga periods, only 5,120 years are passed out of 432,000 years of current Kali Yuga, and hence another 426,880 years are left to complete this 28th Kali Yuga of Vaivaswatha Manvantara.{{refn|group=note|According to [[Sri Yukteswar Giri]], guru of [[Paramahansa Yogananda]],  The ascending phase of the Kali Yuga began in September 499 CE. Since September 1699, we have been in the ascending phase of the Dwapara Yuga. According to Sri Yukteswar, nobody wanted to announce the bad news of the beginning of the descending Kali Yuga, so they kept adding years to the Dvapara date (at that time 2400 Dvapara) only retitling the epoch to Kali.{{sfn|Yukteswar|1949}}}}

The '''history of mathematical notation'''&lt;ref&gt;[[Florian Cajori]]. A History of Mathematical Notations: Two Volumes in One. Cosimo, Inc., Dec 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; includes the commencement, progress, and [[cultural diffusion]] of [[mathematical symbol]]s and the conflict of the methods of notation confronted in a notation's move to popularity or inconspicuousness. [[Mathematical notation]]&lt;ref&gt;A Dictionary of Science, Literature, &amp; Art, Volume 2. Edited by [[William Thomas Brande]], [[George William Cox]]. Pg [https://books.google.com/books?id=J5tPAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA683 683]&lt;/ref&gt; comprises the [[symbol]]s used to write mathematical [[equation]]s and [[formula]]s. Notation generally implies a set of [[well-defined]] representations of quantities and symbols operators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Notation.html |title=Notation - from Wolfram MathWorld |publisher=Mathworld.wolfram.com |accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The history includes [[Hindu–Arabic numerals]], letters from the [[Roman alphabet|Roman]], [[Greek alphabet|Greek]], [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]], and [[German alphabet|German]] [[alphabet]]s, and a host of symbols invented by mathematicians over the past several centuries.

The development of mathematical notation can be divided in stages.&lt;ref&gt;Diophantos of Alexandria: A Study in the History of Greek Algebra. By Sir Thomas Little Heath. Pg [https://books.google.com/books?id=ABkPAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA77 77].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mathematics: Its Power and Utility. By Karl J. Smith. Pg [https://books.google.com/books?id=-0x2JszrkooC&amp;pg=PA86 86].&lt;/ref&gt; The "''[[rhetorical]]''" stage is where calculations are performed by words and no symbols are used.&lt;ref&gt;The Commercial Revolution and the Beginnings of Western Mathematics in Renaissance Florence, 1300–1500. Warren Van Egmond. 1976. Page 233.&lt;/ref&gt; The "''[[syncopated]]''" stage is where frequently used operations and quantities are represented by symbolic [[syntax|syntactical]] abbreviations. From ancient times through the post-classical age,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Or the Middle Ages.&lt;/ref&gt; bursts of mathematical creativity were often followed by centuries of stagnation.  As the [[early modern age]] opened and the worldwide spread of knowledge began, written examples of mathematical developments came to light.  The "''symbolic''" stage is where comprehensive systems of notation supersede rhetoric. Beginning in Italy in the 16th century, new mathematical developments, interacting with new scientific discoveries, were made at an increasing pace that continues through the present day. This symbolic system was in use by medieval Indian mathematicians and in Europe since the middle of the 17th century,&lt;ref&gt;[[Solomon Gandz]]. "The Sources of al-Khowarizmi's Algebra"&lt;/ref&gt; and has continued to develop in the [[contemporary era]].

The area of study known as the [[history of mathematics]] is primarily an investigation into the origin of discoveries in mathematics and, the focus here, the investigation into the mathematical methods and notation of the past.

==Rhetorical stage==
{{see also|Measurement}}
Although the history commences with that of the [[#Acrophonic and Milesian numeration|Ionian schools]], there is no doubt that those [[Ancient Greek]]s who paid attention to it were largely indebted to the previous investigations of the [[Ancient Egyptian]]s and [[Phoenicia|Ancient Phoenicians]]. Numerical notation's distinctive feature, i.e. symbols having local as well as intrinsic values ([[arithmetic]]), implies a state of [[civilization]] at the period of its invention. Our knowledge of the mathematical attainments of these early peoples, to which this section is devoted, is imperfect and the following brief notes be regarded as a summary of the conclusions which seem most probable, and the history of mathematics begins with the symbolic sections.

Many areas of mathematics began with the study of [[Applied mathematics|real world problems]], before the underlying rules and concepts were identified and defined as [[abstract structure]]s. For example, geometry has its origins in the [[distance|calculation of distances]] and [[area]]s in the real world; algebra started with methods of solving problems in [[arithmetic]].

There can be no doubt that most early peoples which have left records knew something of [[numeration]] and [[mechanics]], and that a few were also acquainted with the elements of [[Surveying|land-surveying]]. In particular, the Egyptians paid attention to geometry and numbers, and the Phoenicians to practical arithmetic, [[book-keeping]], [[navigation]], and land-surveying. The [[Knowledge transfer|results attained by these people seem to have been accessible]], under certain conditions, to travelers. It is probable that the knowledge of the Egyptians and Phoenicians was largely the result of [[observation]] and [[measurement]], and represented the accumulated experience of many ages.

===Beginning of notation===
{{see also|Ancient history|History of writing ancient numbers|History of science in early cultures}}

Written mathematics began with numbers expressed as [[tally marks]], with each tally representing a single unit. The numerical symbols consisted probably of strokes or notches cut in wood or stone, and intelligible alike to all nations.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Such characters, in fact, are preserved with little alteration in the [[Roman notation]], an account of which may be found in [[John Leslie (physicist)|John Leslie]]'s Philosophy of Arithmetic.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one notch in a bone represented one animal, or person, or anything else. The peoples with whom the Greeks of Asia Minor (amongst whom notation in western history begins) were likely to have come into frequent contact were those inhabiting the eastern [[littoral]] of the Mediterranean: and Greek tradition uniformly assigned the special development of geometry to the Egyptians, and that of the [[number theory|science of numbers]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[[Number theory]] is branch of pure mathematics devoted primarily to the [[Integer|study of the integers]]. Number theorists study [[prime number]]s as well as the properties of objects made out of integers (e.g., [[rational number]]s) or defined as generalizations of the [[integer]]s (e.g., [[algebraic integer]]s).&lt;/ref&gt; either to the Egyptians or to the Phoenicians.

The [[Ancient Egyptians]] had a symbolic notation which was the [[numeration by Hieroglyphics]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Americana. By Thomas Gamaliel Bradford. Pg [https://books.google.com/books?id=hrRPAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA314 314]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mathematical Excursion, Enhanced Edition: Enhanced Webassign Edition By Richard N. Aufmann, Joanne Lockwood, Richard D. Nation, Daniel K. Cleg. Pg [https://books.google.com/books?id=GTgTnSGMukgC&amp;pg=PA186 186]&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Egyptian mathematics]] had a symbol for one, ten, one-hundred, one-thousand, ten-thousand, one-hundred-thousand, and one-million.  Smaller digits were placed on the left of the number, as they are in Hindu–Arabic numerals.  Later, the Egyptians used [[hieratic]] instead of [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphic]] script to show numbers.  Hieratic was more like cursive and replaced several groups of symbols with individual ones.  For example, the four vertical lines used to represent four were replaced by a single horizontal line.  This is found in the [[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus]] (c. 2000–1800 BC) and the [[Moscow Mathematical Papyrus]] (c. 1890 BC).  The system the Egyptians used was discovered and modified by many other civilizations in the Mediterranean.  The Egyptians also had symbols for basic operations: legs going forward represented addition, and legs walking backward to represent subtraction.

The [[Mesopotamians]] had symbols for each power of ten.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metu.edu.tr/~beyaz/303/presentations/egyptMesopotamia.pdf Mathematics in Egypt and Mesopotamia]{{dead link|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, they wrote their numbers in almost exactly the same way done in modern times.  Instead of having symbols for each power of ten, they would just put the [[coefficient]] of that number.  Each digit was at separated by only a space, but by the time of [[Alexander the Great]], they had created a symbol that represented zero and was a placeholder.  The Mesopotamians also used a [[sexagesimal]] system, that is base sixty.  It is this system that is used in modern times when measuring time and angles. Babylonian mathematics is derived from more than 400 clay tablets unearthed since the 1850s.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, C. B. ''A History of Mathematics'', 2nd ed. rev. by [[Uta Merzbach|Uta C. Merzbach]]. New York: Wiley, 1989 {{ISBN|0-471-09763-2}} (1991 pbk ed. {{ISBN|0-471-54397-7}}). "Mesopotamia" p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Written in [[Cuneiform script]], tablets were inscribed whilst the clay was moist, and baked hard in an oven or by the heat of the sun. Some of these appear to be graded homework. The earliest evidence of written mathematics dates back to the ancient [[Sumer]]ians and the system of [[metrology]] from 3000 BC. From around 2500 BC onwards, the Sumerians wrote [[multiplication table]]s on clay tablets and dealt with [[geometry|geometrical]] exercises and [[Division (mathematics)|division]] problems. The earliest traces of the Babylonian numerals also date back to this period.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan J. Melville (2003). [http://it.stlawu.edu/~dmelvill/mesomath/3Mill/chronology.html Third Millennium Chronology], ''Third Millennium Mathematics''. [[St. Lawrence University]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of Mesopotamian clay tablets date from 1800 to 1600 BC, and cover topics which include fractions, algebra, quadratic and cubic equations, and the calculation of [[Regular number|regular]] [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] [[Twin prime|pairs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Aaboe | last = Aaboe | first = Asger | title = Episodes from the Early History of Mathematics | year = 1998 | publisher = Random House | location = New York | pages = 30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tablets also include multiplication tables and methods for solving [[linear equation|linear]] and [[quadratic equation]]s. The Babylonian tablet [[YBC 7289]] gives an approximation of {{radic|2}} accurate to five decimal places. Babylonian mathematics were written using a [[sexagesimal]] (base-60) [[numeral system]]. From this derives the modern day usage of 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, and 360 (60 x 6) degrees in a circle, as well as the use of minutes and seconds of arc to denote fractions of a degree. Babylonian advances in mathematics were facilitated by the fact that 60 has many divisors: the reciprocal of any integer which is a multiple of divisors of 60 has a finite expansion in base 60. (In decimal arithmetic, only reciprocals of multiples of 2 and 5 have finite decimal expansions.) Also, unlike the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans, the Babylonians had a true place-value system, where digits written in the left column represented larger values, much as in the [[decimal]] system. They lacked, however, an equivalent of the decimal point, and so the place value of a symbol often had to be inferred from the context.

The history of mathematics cannot with certainty be traced back to any school or period before that of the Ionian Greeks, but the subsequent history may be divided into periods, the distinctions between which are tolerably well marked. Greek mathematics, which originated with the study of geometry, tended from its commencement to be deductive and scientific. Since the fourth century AD, [[Pythagoras]] has commonly been given credit for discovering the [[Pythagorean theorem]], a theorem in geometry that states that in a right-angled triangle the area of the square on the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares of the other two sides.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;That is, &lt;math&gt;a^2 + b^2 = c^2&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient mathematical texts are available with the prior mentioned Ancient Egyptians notation and with [[Plimpton 322]] (Babylonian mathematics c. 1900 BC).  The study of mathematics as a subject in its own right begins in the 6th century BC with the [[Pythagoreans]], who coined the term "mathematics" from the ancient Greek ''μάθημα'' (''mathema''), meaning "subject of instruction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Heath|title=A Manual of Greek Mathematics|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plato]]'s influence has been especially strong in mathematics and the sciences. He helped to distinguish between [[pure mathematics|pure]] and [[applied mathematics]] by widening the gap between "arithmetic", now called [[number theory]] and "logistic", now called [[arithmetic]]. [[Greek mathematics]] greatly refined the methods (especially through the introduction of deductive reasoning and [[mathematical rigor]] in [[mathematical proof|proofs]]) and expanded the subject matter of mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;Sir Thomas L. Heath, ''A Manual of Greek Mathematics'', Dover, 1963, p. 1: "In the case of mathematics, it is the Greek contribution which it is most essential to know, for it was the Greeks who made mathematics a science."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]] is credited with what later would be called the [[law of excluded middle]].

In the historical development of geometry, the steps in the abstraction of geometry were made by the ancient Greeks. [[Euclid's Elements]] being the earliest extant documentation of the axioms of plane geometry— though Proclus tells of an earlier [[Axiomatic system|axiomatisation]] by [[Hippocrates of Chios]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Extras/Proclus_history_geometry.html |title=Proclus' Summary |publisher=Gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk |accessdate=2014-06-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923114020/http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Extras/Proclus_history_geometry.html |archive-date=23 September 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Euclid's ''Elements'' (c. 300 BC) is one of the oldest extant Greek mathematical treatises&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[[Autolycus]]' [[On the Moving Sphere]] is another ancient mathematical manuscript of the time.&lt;/ref&gt; and consisted of 13 books written in Alexandria; collecting theorems proven by other mathematicians, supplemented by some original work.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[[Proclus]], a Greek mathematician who lived several centuries after Euclid, wrote in his commentary of the Elements: "Euclid, who put together the Elements, collecting many of [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]]' theorems, perfecting many of [[Theaetetus (mathematician)|Theaetetus]]', and also bringing to irrefragable demonstration the things which were only somewhat loosely proved by his predecessors".&lt;/ref&gt; The document is a successful collection of definitions, postulates (axioms), propositions (theorems and constructions), and mathematical proofs of the propositions. [[Euclid's lemma|Euclid's first theorem]] is a [[Lemma (mathematics)|lemma]] that possesses properties of [[prime number]]s. The influential thirteen books cover Euclidean geometry, geometric algebra, and the ancient Greek version of algebraic systems and elementary number theory. It was ubiquitous in the [[Quadrivium]] and is instrumental in the development of logic, mathematics, and science.

[[Diophantus of Alexandria]] was author of a series of books called ''[[Arithmetica]]'',  many of which are now lost. These texts deal with solving [[algebraic equation]]s. [[Boethius]] provided a place for mathematics in the curriculum in the 6th century when he coined the term ''quadrivium'' to describe the study of arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music. He wrote ''De institutione arithmetica'', a free translation from the Greek of [[Nicomachus]]'s ''Introduction to Arithmetic''; ''De institutione musica'', also derived from Greek sources; and a series of excerpts from Euclid's ''Elements''. His works were theoretical, rather than practical, and were the basis of mathematical study until the recovery of Greek and Arabic mathematical works.&lt;ref&gt;Caldwell, John (1981) "The ''De Institutione Arithmetica'' and the ''De Institutione Musica''", pp. 135–54 in Margaret Gibson, ed., ''Boethius: His Life, Thought, and Influence'', (Oxford: Basil Blackwell).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Folkerts, Menso, ''"Boethius" Geometrie II'', (Wiesbaden: Franz Steiner Verlag, 1970).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acrophonic and Milesian numeration===

The [[ancient Greece|Greeks]] employed [[Attic numeration]],&lt;ref&gt;Mathematics and Measurement By Oswald Ashton Wentworth Dilk. Pg [https://books.google.com/books?id=AKJZvXOS7n4C&amp;pg=PA14 14]&lt;/ref&gt; which was based on the system of the Egyptians and was later adapted and used by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. [[Greek numerals]] one through four were vertical lines, as in the hieroglyphics. The symbol for five was the Greek letter Π (pi), which is the letter of the Greek word for five, ''pente''. Numbers six through nine were ''pente'' with vertical lines next to it. Ten was represented by the letter (Δ) of the word for ten, ''deka'', one hundred by the letter from the word for hundred, etc.

The [[Ionian numeration]] used their entire alphabet including three archaic letters. The numeral notation of the Greeks, though far less convenient than that now in use, was formed on a perfectly regular and scientific plan,&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;A dictionary of science, literature and art, ed. by W.T. Brande. Pg [https://books.google.com/books?id=yo4DAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA683 683]&lt;/ref&gt; and could be used with tolerable effect as an instrument of calculation, to which purpose the Roman system was totally inapplicable. The Greeks divided the twenty-four letters of their alphabet into three classes, and, by adding another symbol to each class, they had characters to represent the units, tens, and hundreds. ([[Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre]]'s Astronomie Ancienne, t. ii.)

This system appeared in the third century BC, before the letters digamma (Ϝ), koppa (Ϟ), and sampi (Ϡ) became obsolete. When lowercase letters became differentiated from upper case letters, the lower case letters were used as the symbols for notation. Multiples of one thousand were written as the nine numbers with a stroke in front of them: thus one thousand was ",α", two-thousand was ",β", etc. M (for μὐριοι, as in "myriad") was used to multiply numbers by ten thousand. For example, the number 88,888,888 would be written as M,ηωπη*ηωπη&lt;ref name=Boyer&gt;Boyer, Carl B. ''A History of Mathematics'', 2nd edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

Greek mathematical reasoning was almost entirely [[geometry|geometric]] (albeit often used to reason about non-geometric subjects such as [[number theory]]), and hence the Greeks had no interest in [[algebra]]ic symbols.

===Chinese mathematical notation===
{{Main|Suzhou numerals}}
{{see also|Chinese numerals}}
[[File:Huama numerals.svg|thumb|The numbers 0–9 in Chinese huāmǎ (花碼) numerals]]
The Chinese used numerals that look much like the tally system.&lt;ref&gt;The American Mathematical Monthly, Volume 16. Pg [https://books.google.com/books?id=JggPAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA131 131]&lt;/ref&gt;  Numbers one through four were horizontal lines.  Five was an X between two horizontal lines; it looked almost exactly the same as the [[Roman numeral]] for ten. Nowadays, the [[Numerals in Unicode#CJK Suzhou (huāmǎ) numerals|huāmǎ system]] is only used for displaying prices in Chinese markets or on traditional handwritten invoices.

In the history of the Chinese, there were those who were familiar with the sciences of arithmetic, geometry, mechanics, optics, navigation, and astronomy. [[Mathematics in China]] emerged independently by the 11th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Chinese_overview.html |title=Overview of Chinese mathematics |publisher=Groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk |accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is almost certain that the Chinese were acquainted with several geometrical or rather architectural implements;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;such as the [[Ruler|rule]], [[Try square|square]], [[compasses]], [[spirit level|water level]] ([[reed level]]), and [[plumb-bob]].&lt;/ref&gt; with mechanical machines;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;such as the [[wheel]] and [[axle]]&lt;/ref&gt; that they knew of the characteristic property of the magnetic needle; and were aware that astronomical events occurred in cycles. Chinese of that time had made attempts to classify or extend the rules of arithmetic or geometry which they knew, and to explain the causes of the phenomena with which they were acquainted beforehand. The Chinese independently developed very large and [[negative number]]s, [[decimal]]s, a place value decimal system, a [[Binary numeral system|binary system]], [[algebra]], [[geometry]], and [[trigonometry]].

[[File:Chounumerals.svg|thumb|Counting rod numerals]]
[[Counting rods|Chinese mathematics]] made early contributions, including a [[place value system]].&lt;ref&gt;George Gheverghese Joseph, ''The Crest of the Peacock: Non-European Roots of Mathematics'', Penguin Books, London, 1991, pp.140—148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Georges Ifrah, ''Universalgeschichte der Zahlen'', Campus, Frankfurt/New York, 1986, pp.428—437&lt;/ref&gt;  The geometrical theorem known to the ancient Chinese were acquainted was applicable in certain cases (namely the ratio of sides).&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The area of the square described on the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares described on the sides&lt;/ref&gt; It is that geometrical theorems which can be demonstrated in the quasi-experimental way of superposition were also known to them. In arithmetic their knowledge seems to have been confined to the art of calculation by means of the [[swan-pan]], and the power of expressing the results in writing. Our knowledge of the early attainments of the Chinese, slight though it is, is more complete than in the case of most of their contemporaries. It is thus instructive, and serves to illustrate the fact, that it can be known a nation may possess considerable skill in the applied arts with but our knowledge of the later mathematics on which those arts are founded can be scarce. Knowledge of Chinese mathematics before 254 BC is somewhat fragmentary, and even after this date the manuscript traditions are obscure. Dates centuries before the classical period are generally considered conjectural by Chinese scholars unless accompanied by verified archaeological evidence.

As in other early societies the focus was on [[astronomy]] in order to perfect the agricultural [[calendar]], and other practical tasks, and not on establishing [[formal systems]].The [[Chinese Board of Mathematics]] duties were confined to the annual preparation of an almanac, the dates and predictions in which it regulated. Ancient Chinese mathematicians did not develop an axiomatic approach, but made advances in algorithm development and algebra. The achievement of Chinese algebra reached its zenith in the 13th century, when [[Zhu Shijie]] invented method of four unknowns.

As a result of obvious linguistic and geographic barriers, as well as content, Chinese mathematics and that of the mathematics of the ancient Mediterranean world are presumed to have developed more or less independently up to the time when ''[[The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art]]'' reached its final form, while the ''[[Writings on Reckoning]]'' and ''[[Huainanzi]]'' are roughly contemporary with classical Greek mathematics. Some exchange of ideas across Asia through known cultural exchanges from at least Roman times is likely. Frequently, elements of the mathematics of early societies correspond to rudimentary results found later in branches of modern mathematics such as geometry or [[number theory]]. The [[Pythagorean theorem#History|Pythagorean theorem]] for example, [[Zhoubi Suanjing|has been attested]] to the time of the [[Duke of Zhou]]. Knowledge of [[Pascal's triangle]] has also been shown to have existed in China centuries before [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psupress.psu.edu/books/titles/0-271-01238-2.html |title=Frank J.

===Indian mathematical notation===
Although the origin of our present system of numerical notation is ancient, there is no doubt that it was in use among the Hindus over two thousand years ago. The algebraic notation of the [[Indian mathematics|Indian mathematician]], [[Brahmagupta]], was [[History of algebra#Diophantine algebra|syncopated]]. Addition was indicated by placing the numbers side by side, subtraction by placing a dot over the [[subtrahend]] (the number to be subtracted), and division by placing the divisor below the dividend, similar to our notation but without the bar. Multiplication, evolution, and unknown quantities were represented by abbreviations of appropriate terms.&lt;ref name="Boyer Brahmagupta Indeterminate equations"&gt;Boyer, C. B. A History of Mathematics, 2nd ed. rev. by Uta C. Merzbach. New York: Wiley, 1989 {{ISBN|0-471-09763-2}} (1991 pbk ed. {{ISBN|0-471-54397-7}}). "China and India" p. 221. (cf., "he was the first one to give a ''general'' solution of the linear Diophantine equation ax + by = c, where a, b, and c are integers. [...] It is greatly to the credit of Brahmagupta that he gave ''all'' integral solutions of the linear Diophantine equation, whereas Diophantus himself had been satisfied to give one particular solution of an indeterminate equation. Inasmuch as Brahmagupta used some of the same examples as Diophantus, we see again the likelihood of Greek influence in India – or the possibility that they both made use of a common source, possibly from Babylonia. It is interesting to note also that the algebra of Brahmagupta, like that of Diophantus, was syncopated. Addition was indicated by juxtaposition, subtraction by placing a dot over the subtrahend, and division by placing the divisor below the dividend, as in our fractional notation but without the bar. The operations of multiplication and evolution (the taking of roots), as well as unknown quantities, were represented by abbreviations of appropriate words.")&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system]] and the rules for the use of its operations, in use throughout the world today, likely evolved over the course of the first millennium AD in [[Indian mathematics|India]] and was transmitted to the west via Islamic mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kaplan, "The Nothing That Is: A Natural History of Zero", Allen Lane/The Penguin Press, London, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/HistTopics/Indian_numerals.html |title="The ingenious method of expressing every possible number using a set of ten symbols (each symbol having a place value and an absolute value) emerged in India.

====Hindu–Arabic numerals and notations====
{{Main|History of the Hindu–Arabic numeral system}}
[[File:Image-Al-Kitāb al-muḫtaṣar fī ḥisāb al-ğabr wa-l-muqābala.jpg|thumb|A page from al-Khwārizmī's ''Algebra'']]
Despite their name, Arabic numerals actually started in India. The reason for this [[misnomer]] is Europeans saw the numerals used in an Arabic book, ''[[Concerning the Hindu Art of Reckoning]]'', by [[al-Khwarizmi|Mohommed ibn-Musa al-Khwarizmi]]. Al-Khwārizmī wrote several important books on the Hindu–Arabic numerals and on methods for solving equations. His book ''On the Calculation with Hindu Numerals'', written about 825, along with the work of [[Al-Kindi]],&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Al-Kindi also introduced [[cryptanalysis]] and [[frequency analysis]].&lt;/ref&gt; were instrumental in spreading [[Indian mathematics]] and [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system|Indian numerals]] to the West. Al-Khwarizmi did not claim the numerals as Arabic, but over several Latin translations, the fact that the numerals were Indian in origin was lost. The word ''[[algorithm]]'' is derived from the Latinization of Al-Khwārizmī's name, Algoritmi, and the word ''[[algebra]]'' from the title of one of his works, ''[[The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing|Al-Kitāb al-mukhtaṣar fī hīsāb al-ğabr wa’l-muqābala]]'' (''The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing'').

Al-Khwārizmī also studied an equation for its own sake and "in a generic manner, insofar as it does not simply emerge in the course of solving a problem, but is specifically called on to define an infinite class of problems."&lt;ref name=Rashed-Armstrong&gt;{{Cite book | last1=Rashed | first1=R. | last2=Armstrong | first2=Angela | year=1994 | title=The Development of Arabic Mathematics | publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | isbn=0-7923-2565-6 | oclc=29181926 | pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Al-Karaji]], in his treatise ''al-Fakhri'', extends the methodology to incorporate integer powers and integer roots of unknown quantities.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Something close to a [[Mathematical proof|proof]] by [[mathematical induction]] appears in a book written by Al-Karaji around 1000 AD, who used it to prove the [[binomial theorem]], [[Pascal's triangle]], and the sum of [[integral]] [[Cube (algebra)|cubes]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Victor J.

Woepcke (1853). ''Extrait du Fakhri, traité d'Algèbre par Abou Bekr Mohammed Ben Alhacan Alkarkhi''. Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; praised Al-Karaji for being "the first who introduced the [[theory]] of [[algebra]]ic [[calculus]]." Also in the 10th century, [[Abul Wafa]] translated the works of [[Diophantus]] into Arabic. [[Ibn al-Haytham]] would develop [[analytic geometry]]. Al-Haytham derived the formula for the sum of the fourth powers, using a method that is readily generalizable for determining the general formula for the sum of any integral powers. Al-Haytham performed an integration in order to find the volume of a [[paraboloid]], and was able to generalize his result for the integrals of [[polynomial]]s up to the [[Quartic polynomial|fourth degree]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;He thus came close to finding a general formula for the [[integral]]s of polynomials, but he was not concerned with any polynomials higher than the fourth degree.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Katz&gt;Victor J. Katz (1995), "Ideas of Calculus in Islam and India", ''Mathematics Magazine'' '''68''' (3): 163–74.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late 11th century, [[Omar Khayyam]] would develop [[algebraic geometry]], wrote ''Discussions of the Difficulties in Euclid'',&lt;ref group="note"&gt;a book about what he perceived as flaws in [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']], especially the [[parallel postulate]]&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote on the general geometric solution to [[cubic equation]]s. [[Nasir al-Din Tusi]] (Nasireddin) made advances in [[spherical trigonometry]]. Muslim mathematicians during this period include the addition of the [[decimal point]] notation to the [[Arabic numerals]].

Many Greek and Arabic texts on mathematics were then [[Latin translations of the 12th century|translated into Latin]], which led to further development of mathematics in medieval Europe. In the 12th century, scholars traveled to Spain and Sicily seeking scientific Arabic texts, including al-Khwārizmī's&lt;ref group="note"&gt;translated into Latin by [[Robert of Chester]]&lt;/ref&gt; and the complete text of [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;translated in various versions by [[Adelard of Bath]], [[Herman of Carinthia]], and [[Gerard of Cremona]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marie-Thérèse d'Alverny, "Translations and Translators", pp. 421–62 in Robert L. Benson and Giles Constable, ''Renaissance and Renewal in the Twelfth Century'', (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1982).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guy Beaujouan, "The Transformation of the Quadrivium", pp. 463–87 in Robert L. Benson and Giles Constable, ''Renaissance and Renewal in the Twelfth Century'', (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1982).&lt;/ref&gt; One of the European books that advocated using the numerals was ''[[Liber Abaci]]'', by Leonardo of Pisa, better known as [[Fibonacci]]. ''Liber Abaci'' is better known for the mathematical problem Fibonacci wrote in it about a population of rabbits.  The growth of the population ended up being a [[Fibonacci sequence]], where a term is the sum of the two preceding terms.

[[Abū al-Hasan ibn Alī al-Qalasādī]] (1412–1482) was the last major medieval [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|Arab algebraist]], who improved on the [[Mathematical notation|algebraic notation]] earlier used by [[Ibn al-Yasamin|Ibn al-Yāsamīn]] in the 12th century{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} and, in the [[Maghreb]], by [[Ibn al-Banna]] in the 13th century.&lt;ref name=Qalasadi&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Al-Qalasadi|title= Abu'l Hasan ibn Ali al Qalasadi}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the syncopated notations of their predecessors, [[Diophantus]] and [[Brahmagupta]], which lacked symbols for [[Operation (mathematics)|mathematical operations]],&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, C.

"Revival and Decline of Greek Mathematics" p. 178 (cf., "The chief difference between Diophantine syncopation and the modern algebraic notation is the lack of special symbols for operations and relations, as well as of the exponential notation.")&lt;/ref&gt; al-Qalasadi's algebraic notation was the first to have symbols for these functions and was thus "the first steps toward the introduction of algebraic symbolism."

The study of [[linear algebra]] emerged from the study of [[determinant]]s, which were used to solve systems of [[linear equation]]s. Calculus had two main systems of notation, each created by one of the creators: that developed by [[Isaac Newton]] and the notation developed by [[Gottfried Leibniz]].  Leibniz's is the notation used most often today.  Newton's was simply a dot or dash placed above the function.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For example, the derivative of the function ''x'' would be written as &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}&lt;/math&gt;.  The second derivative of ''x'' would be written as &lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}&lt;/math&gt;, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; In modern usage, this notation generally denotes derivatives of physical quantities with respect to time, and is used frequently in the science of [[mechanics]]. Leibniz, on the other hand, used the letter ''d'' as a prefix to indicate differentiation, and introduced the notation representing derivatives as if they were a special type of fraction.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For example, the derivative of the function ''x'' with respect to the variable ''t'' in Leibniz's notation would be written as &lt;math&gt;{ dx \over dt }&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; This notation makes explicit the variable with respect to which the derivative of the function is taken. Leibniz also created the integral symbol.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;That is, &lt;math&gt;\int_{-N}^{N} f(x)\, dx&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  The symbol is an [[long s|elongated S]], representing the [[Latin]] word ''Summa'', meaning "sum".  When finding areas under curves, integration is often illustrated by dividing the area into infinitely many tall, thin rectangles, whose areas are added.  Thus, the integral symbol is an elongated s, for sum.

[[Letters of the alphabet]] in this time were to be used as symbols of [[quantity]]; and although much diversity existed with respect to the choice of letters, there were to be several [[Open standard|universally recognized rules]] in the following history.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; Here thus in the history of equations the first letters of the alphabet were indicatively known as [[coefficients]], the last letters the [[dict:unknown|unknown term]]s (an  ''[[Unknown known#Unknown knowns|incerti ordinis]]''). In [[algebraic geometry]], again, a similar rule was to be observed, the last letters of the alphabet there denoting the variable or current [[coordinates]]. Certain letters, such as &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;, [[etc.]], were by [[consensus gentium|universal consent]] appropriated as symbols of the frequently occurring numbers [[Pi|3.14159 ...]], and [[e (mathematical constant)|2.7182818 ....]],&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See also: [[List of representations of e]]&lt;/ref&gt; etc., and their use in any other acceptation was to be avoided as much as possible.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; Letters, too, were to be employed as symbols of operation, and with them other previously mentioned arbitrary operation characters. The letters [[d|&lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;]], [[long s|elongated &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;]] were to be appropriated as operative symbols in the [[differential calculus]] and [[integral calculus]], [[Delta (letter)|&lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;]] and ∑ in the [[calculus of differences]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; In [[Functional (mathematics)|functional notation]], a letter, as a symbol of operation, is combined with another which is regarded as a symbol of [[Quantity#Quantity in mathematics|quantity]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Thus &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Result|mathematical result]] of the performance of the operation &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; upon the [[Mathematical object|subject]] &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. If upon this result the same operation were repeated, the new result would be expressed by &lt;math&gt;f[f(x)]&lt;/math&gt;, or more concisely by &lt;math&gt;f^2(x)&lt;/math&gt;, and so on. The quantity &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; itself regarded as the result of the same operation &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; upon some other function; the proper symbol for which is, by analogy, &lt;math&gt;f^{-1} (x)&lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; are symbols of [[Multiplicative inverse|inverse operation]]s, the former cancelling the effect of the latter on the subject &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f^{-1} (x)&lt;/math&gt; in a similar manner are termed [[inverse function]]s.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1718, Thomas Twinin used the [[Slash (punctuation)|division slash]] ([[Slash (punctuation)|solidus]]), deriving it from the earlier Arabic [[horizontal fraction bar]]. [[Pierre-Simon Laplace|Pierre-Simon, marquis de Laplace]] developed the widely used [[Laplace operator|Laplacian differential operator]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;That is, &lt;math&gt;\Delta f(p) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1750, [[Gabriel Cramer]] developed "''[[Cramer's Rule]]''" for solving [[linear system]]s.

====Euler and prime notations====
[[File:Euler's signature.png|thumbnail|Leonhard Euler's signature]]
[[Leonhard Euler]] was one of the most prolific mathematicians in history, and also a prolific inventor of canonical notation. [[Contributions of Leonhard Euler to mathematics|His contributions]] include his use of ''[[e (mathematical constant)|e]]'' to represent the base of [[natural logarithm]]s.  It is not known exactly why &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; was chosen, but it was probably because the four letters of the alphabet were already commonly used to represent variables and other constants.  Euler used &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; to represent [[pi]] consistently.  The use of &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; was suggested by [[William Jones (mathematician)|William Jones]], who used it as shorthand for [[perimeter]].  Euler used &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; to represent the square root of negative one,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;That is, &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; although he earlier used it as an ''infinite number.'' &lt;ref group="note"&gt;Today, the symbol created by [[John Wallis]], &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;, is used for infinity.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;As in, &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{n^2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; For [[summation]], Euler used [[sigma]], [[Capital-sigma notation|Σ]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[[Capital-sigma notation]] uses a symbol that compactly represents summation of many similar terms: the ''summation symbol'', ''[[Sigma|∑]]'', an enlarged form of the upright capital Greek letter [[Sigma (letter)|Sigma]]. This is defined as: &lt;br&gt;{{Equation box 1|indent =:|equation =&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=m}^n a_i = a_m + a_{m+1} + a_{m+2} +\cdots+ a_{n-1} + a_n. &lt;/math&gt;|cellpadding= 6|border = 0|border colour = black|background colour=white}}&lt;br&gt;
Where, ''i'' represents the ''index of summation''; ''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is an indexed variable representing each successive term in the series; ''m'' is the ''lower bound of summation'', and ''n'' is the ''upper bound of summation''. The ''"i = m"'' under the summation symbol means that the index ''i'' starts out equal to ''m''.  The index, ''i'', is incremented by 1 for each successive term, stopping when ''i'' = ''n''.&lt;/ref&gt; For [[function (mathematics)|functions]], Euler used the notation &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; to represent a function of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. In 1730, Euler wrote the [[gamma function]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;That is, &lt;math&gt;n!=\int_{0}^{1}(-\ln s)^{n}\,{\rm d}s&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br&gt; valid for n &gt; 0.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1736, Euler produces his paper on the [[Seven Bridges of Königsberg]]&lt;ref&gt;Euler, Leonhard, [http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~euler/docs/originals/E053.pdf Solutio problematis ad geometriam situs pertinentis]&lt;/ref&gt; initiating the study of [[graph theory]].

The [[William Emerson (mathematician)|mathematician, William Emerson]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=x_82AAAAMAAJ The elements of geometry]. By William Emerson&lt;/ref&gt; would develop the [[proportionality sign]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;That is, &lt;div style="font-size:200%;"&gt;∝&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Proportionality is the [[ratio]] of one quantity to another, especially the ratio of a part compared to a whole. In a mathematical context, a proportion is the statement of equality between two ratios; See [[Proportionality (mathematics)]], the relationship of two variables whose ratio is constant. See also [[aspect ratio]], geometric proportions.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YLxHMwEACAAJ The Doctrine of Proportion, Arithmetical and Geometrical. Together with a General Method of Arening by Proportional Quantities]. By William Emerson.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Mathematical Correspondent. By George Baron. [https://books.google.com/books?id=IXkAAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA83 83]&lt;/ref&gt; Much later in the abstract expressions of the value of various proportional phenomena, the [[parts-per notation]] would become useful as a set of pseudo units to describe small values of miscellaneous [[Dimensionless quantity|dimensionless quantities]]. [[Marquis de Condorcet]], in 1768, advanced the [[partial differential]] sign.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The ''[[Curl (mathematics)|curly d]]'' or ''[[Jacobi's delta]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1771, [[Alexandre-Théophile Vandermonde]] deduced the importance of topological features when discussing the [[Knot theory|properties of knots]] related to the geometry of position. Between 1772 and 1788, [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]] re-formulated the formulas and calculations of Classical "Newtonian" mechanics, called [[Lagrangian mechanics]]. The [[prime symbol]] for derivatives was also made by Lagrange.

====Gauss, Hamilton, and Matrix notations====
At the turn of the 19th century, [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] developed the [[Identity (mathematics)|identity sign]] for [[congruence relation]] and, in [[Quadratic reciprocity]], the [[Floor and ceiling functions|integral part]]. Gauss contributed [[function (mathematics)|functions]] of [[complex variable]]s, in [[geometry]], and on the convergence of [[series (mathematics)|series]]. He gave the satisfactory proofs of the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] and of the [[quadratic reciprocity law]]. Gauss developed the theory of solving linear systems by using [[Gaussian elimination]], which was initially listed as an advancement in [[geodesy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vitulli |first=Marie |authorlink= Marie A.

Also in this time, [[Niels Henrik Abel]] and [[Évariste Galois]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[[Galois theory]] and [[Galois geometry]] is named after him.&lt;/ref&gt; conducted their work on the [[solvability of equations]], linking [[group theory]] and [[Field theory (mathematics)|field theory]].

After the 1800s, [[Christian Kramp]] would promote [[factorial]] notation during his research in generalized factorial function which applied to non-integers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Kramp.html |title=Kramp biography |publisher=History.mcs.st-and.ac.uk |accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Diaz Gergonne]] introduced the [[set inclusion]] signs.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;That is, "subset of" and "superset of"; This would later be redeveloped by [[Ernst Schröder]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]] developed [[Dirichlet L-function|Dirichlet ''L''-functions]] to give the proof of [[Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions]] and began [[analytic number theory]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;A [[number theory|science of numbers]] that uses methods from [[mathematical analysis]] to solve problems about the integers.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1828, Gauss proved his [[Theorema Egregium]] (''remarkable theorem'' in Latin), establishing property of surfaces. In the 1830s, [[George Green (mathematician)|George Green]] developed [[Green's function]]. In 1829. [[Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi]] publishes [[Fundamenta nova theoriae functionum ellipticarum]] with his [[Elliptic function|elliptic]] [[theta function]]s. By 1841, [[Karl Weierstrass]], the "father of modern [[mathematical analysis|analysis]]", elaborated on the concept of [[absolute value]] and the [[determinant of a matrix]].

[[Matrix notation]] would be more fully developed by [[Arthur Cayley]] in his three papers, on subjects which had been suggested by reading the [[Mécanique analytique]]&lt;ref&gt;Mécanique analytique: [https://books.google.com/books?id=Q8MKAAAAYAAJ Volume 1], [https://books.google.com/books?id=hclDyo8wE44C Volume 2]. By [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]]. Ms. [[Ve Courcier]], 1811.&lt;/ref&gt; of Lagrange and some of the works of Laplace. Cayley defined [[matrix multiplication]] and [[matrix inverse]]s. Cayley used a single letter to denote a matrix,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=tZdQAAAAYAAJ The collected mathematical papers of Arthur Cayley]. Volume 11. Page [https://books.google.com/books?id=tZdQAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA243 243].&lt;/ref&gt; thus treating a matrix as an aggregate object. He also realized the connection between matrices and determinants,&lt;ref&gt;Historical Encyclopedia of Natural and Mathematical Sciences, Volume 1. By Ari Ben-Menahem. Pg [https://books.google.com/books?id=9tUrarQYhKMC&amp;pg=PA2070 2070].&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote "''There would be many things to say about this theory of matrices which should, it seems to me, precede the theory of determinants''".&lt;ref name="Vitulli, Marie"&gt;[[Marie A.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Though his use describes something different from what is now meant by a tensor.

In 1848, [[James Joseph Sylvester]] introduced into [[matrix algebra]] the term [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This is Latin for "womb".&lt;/ref&gt;

====Maxwell, Clifford, and Ricci notations====
[[File:James Clerk Maxwell.png|thumbnail|[[James Clerk Maxwell]]
----
Maxwell's most prominent achievement was to formulate a [[Maxwell's equations|set of equations]] that united previously unrelated observations, experiments, and equations of [[electricity]], [[magnetism]], and [[optics]] into a consistent theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=James Clerk Maxwell |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/James_Clerk_Maxwell |accessdate=25 March 2013 |publisher=IEEE Global History Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;]] 
In 1864 [[James Clerk Maxwell]] reduced all of the then current knowledge of electromagnetism into a linked set of [[differential equation]]s with 20 equations in 20 variables, contained in ''[[A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field]]''.&lt;ref name=ADTEF&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rstl.1865.0008 |last=Maxwell |first=James Clerk |authorlink=James Clerk Maxwell |title=A dynamical theory of the electromagnetic field | url=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/A_Dynamical_Theory_of_the_Electromagnetic_Field.pdf |format=PDF  |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |volume=155 |pages=459–512 |year=1865}} (This article accompanied a December 8, 1864 presentation by Maxwell to the Royal Society.)&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Maxwell's equations]].) The method of calculation which it is necessary to employ was given by Lagrange, and afterwards developed, with some modifications, by [[Hamilton's equations]]. It is usually referred to as [[Hamilton's principle]]; when the equations in the original form are used they are known as [[Lagrange's equations]]. In 1871 [[Richard Dedekind]] called a set of real or complex numbers which is closed under the four arithmetic operations a [[field (mathematics)|field]]. In 1873 Maxwell presented ''[[A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism]]''.

In 1878, [[William Kingdon Clifford]] published his [[Elements of Dynamic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Internet Archive|elementsofdynami01clifiala|Books I, II, III (1878)}}; {{Internet Archive|elementsofdynami02clifiala|Book IV (1887)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clifford developed [[split-biquaternion]]s,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;That is, [[History of quaternions|&lt;math&gt;q = w + xi + yj + zk &lt;/math&gt;]]&lt;/ref&gt; which he called ''algebraic motors''. Clifford obviated quaternion study by separating the [[dot product]] and [[cross product]] of two vectors from the complete quaternion notation.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Clifford intersected algebra with Hamilton's quaternions by replacing [[Hermann Grassmann]]'s rule ''e&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;e&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 0 by the rule ''e&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;e&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 1. For more details, see [[exterior algebra]].&lt;/ref&gt; This approach made [[vector calculus]] available to engineers and others working in [[three dimensions]] and [[skeptical]] of the [[Phase (waves)|lead–lag effect]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See: [[Phasor]], [[Group (mathematics)]], [[Signal velocity]], [[Polyphase system]], [[Harmonic oscillator]], and [[RLC series circuit]]&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Four-dimensional space|fourth dimension]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Or the concept of a fourth spatial dimension. See also: [[Spacetime]], the unification of time and space as a four-dimensional [[Continuum (measurement)|continuum]]; and, [[Minkowski space]], the mathematical setting for special relativity.&lt;/ref&gt;  The common [[vector notation]]s are used when working with vectors which are [[vector (geometric)|spatial]] or more abstract members of [[vector space]]s, while [[angle notation]] (or [[phasor (sine waves)|phasor]] notation) is a notation used in [[electronics]].

In 1881, [[Leopold Kronecker]] defined what he called a "domain of rationality", which is a [[field extension]] of the [[Field of rationals|field of rational numbers]] in modern terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Galois Theory | volume=106 | series=Pure and Applied Mathematics | first=David A. | last=Cox | edition=2nd | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | year=2012 | isbn=1118218426 | page=348 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1882, {{Interlanguage link multi|Hüseyin Tevfik Paşa|tr}} wrote the book titled "Linear Algebra".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.journals.istanbul.edu.tr/tr/index.php/oba/article/download/9103/8452 |title=TÜBİTAK ULAKBİM DergiPark |publisher=Journals.istanbul.edu.tr |accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/linearalgebra00tevfgoog |title=Linear Algebra : Hussein Tevfik : Free Download &amp; Streaming : Internet Archive |publisher=Archive.org |accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lord Kelvin]]'s  [[Aether theories|aetheric]] [[atomic theory|atom theory]] (1860s) led [[Peter Guthrie Tait]], in 1885, to publish a [[topology|topological]] table of knots with up to ten crossings known as the [[Tait conjectures]].

He would provide a definition of a [[vector space]] and [[linear map]]. He would also introduce the [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection sign]], the [[union sign]], the [[membership sign]] (is an element of), and [[existential quantifier]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This raises questions of the [[existence theorem|pure existence theorems]].&lt;/ref&gt; (there exists). Peano would pass to [[Bertrand Russell]] his work in 1900 at a Paris conference; it so impressed Russell that Russell too was taken with the drive to render mathematics more concisely. The result was [[Principia Mathematica]] written with [[Alfred North Whitehead]]. This treatise marks a watershed in modern literature where symbol became dominant.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Peano's ''Formulario Mathematico'', though less popular than Russell's work, continued through five editions. The fifth appeared in 1908 and included 4200 formulas and theorems.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ricci-Curbastro and [[Tullio Levi-Civita]] popularized the [[tensor index notation]] around 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Méthodes de calcul différentiel absolu et leurs applications|last=Ricci|first=Gregorio|author-link=Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro|last2=Levi-Civita|first2=Tullio|journal=Mathematische Annalen|publisher=Springer|volume=54|issue=1–2|date=March 1900|pages=125–201|doi=10.1007/BF01454201|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/u21237446l22rgg7/fulltext.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of this period, [[Felix Klein]]'s "[[Erlangen program]]" identified the underlying theme of various geometries, defining each of them as the study of [[Invariant (mathematics)|properties invariant]] under a given group of [[Symmetry|symmetries]]. This level of abstraction revealed connections between geometry and [[abstract algebra]]. [[Georg Cantor]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Inventor of [[set theory]]&lt;/ref&gt; would introduce the [[Aleph number|aleph symbol]] for [[cardinal number]]s of transfinite sets.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;''Transfinite arithmetic'' is the generalization of [[elementary arithmetic]] to [[infinity|infinite]] quantities like [[infinite sets]]; See [[Transfinite number]]s, [[Transfinite induction]], and [[Transfinite interpolation]]. See also [[Ordinal arithmetic]].&lt;/ref&gt; His notation for the cardinal numbers was the Hebrew letter &lt;math&gt;\aleph&lt;/math&gt; ([[aleph number|aleph]]) with a natural number subscript; for the ordinals he employed the Greek letter ω ([[omega]]). This notation is still in use today in [[ordinal notation]] of a finite sequence of symbols from a finite alphabet which names an [[ordinal number]] according to some scheme which gives meaning to the language. [[Cantor's theorem|His theory]] created a [[Controversy over Cantor's theory|great deal of controversy]]. Cantor would, in his study of [[Fourier series]], consider point sets in [[Euclidean space]].

After the turn of the 20th century, [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] would in [[physical chemistry]] introduce [[middle dot]] for [[dot product]] and the [[multiplication sign]] for [[cross product]]s. He would also supply notation for the scalar and vector products, which was introduced in ''[[Vector Analysis (Gibbs/Wilson)|Vector Analysis]]''. In 1904, [[Ernst Zermelo]] promotes [[axiom of choice]] and his proof of the [[well-ordering theorem]].&lt;ref name="Zermelo, 1904"&gt;{{cite journal| first=Ernst| last=Zermelo| year=1904| url=http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/no_cache/en/dms/load/img/?IDDOC=28526 |format=reprint|title=Beweis, dass jede Menge wohlgeordnet werden kann| journal=Mathematische Annalen| volume=59| issue=4| pages=514–16|doi=10.1007/BF01445300}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bertrand Russell would shortly afterward introduce [[logical disjunction]] ([[Logical disjunction|OR]]) in 1906.

After 1907, mathematicians&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Such as [[Max Dehn]], [[James Waddell Alexander II|J. W. Alexander]], and others.&lt;/ref&gt; studied knots from the point of view of the [[knot group]] and invariants from [[Homology (mathematics)|homology theory]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Such as the [[Alexander polynomial]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, [[Joseph Wedderburn]]'s structure theorems were formulated for finite-dimensional [[algebra over a field|algebras over a field]]. Also in 1908, [[Ernst Zermelo]] proposed "definite" property and the first [[axiomatic set theory]], [[Zermelo set theory]]. In 1910 [[Ernst Steinitz]] published the influential paper ''Algebraic Theory of Fields''.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;(German: Algebraische Theorie der Körper)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In this paper Steinitz axiomatically studied the properties of fields and defined many important field theoretic concepts like [[prime field]], [[perfect field]] and the [[transcendence degree]] of a [[field extension]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911, Steinmetz would publish [https://archive.org/details/theoryandcalcul12steigoog ''Theory and Calculation of Transient Electric Phenomena and Oscillations''].

[[File:Einstein 1921 by F Schmutzer - restoration.jpg|thumbnail|Albert Einstein in 1921]]
[[Albert Einstein]], in 1916, introduced the [[Einstein notation]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The indices range over [[Set (mathematics)|set]] {{math|{1, 2, 3}|}},&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; y = \sum_{i=1}^3 c_i x^i = c_1 x^1 + c_2 x^2 + c_3 x^3 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
is reduced by the convention to:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; y = c_i x^i \,.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Upper indices are not [[Exponentiation|exponents]] but are indices of coordinates, [[coefficient]]s or [[basis vector]]s.&lt;br&gt;
See also:  [[Ricci calculus]]&lt;/ref&gt; which summed over a set of [[index notation|indexed terms]] in a formula, thus exerting notational brevity. [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] would create the [[contour integral]] sign in 1917. Also in 1917, [[Dimitry Mirimanoff]] proposes [[axiom of regularity]]. In 1919, [[Theodor Kaluza]] would solve [[general relativity]] equations using [[Five-dimensional space|five dimensions]], the results would have electromagnetic equations emerge.&lt;ref&gt;Proceedings of the Prussian Academy of Sciences (1918). Pg 966.&lt;/ref&gt; This would be published in 1921 in "Zum Unitätsproblem der Physik".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/sitzungsberichte1921preussi Sitzungsberichte der Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften (1918)]

In 1926, [[Oskar Klein]] would develop the [[Kaluza–Klein theory]].  In 1928, [[Emil Artin]] abstracted [[ring theory]] with [[Artinian ring]]s. In 1933, [[Andrey Kolmogorov]] introduces the ''[[Kolmogorov axioms]]''. In 1937, [[Bruno de Finetti]] deduced the "[[Coherence (philosophical gambling strategy)|operational subjective]]" [[concept]].

====Mathematical symbolism====
{{see also|Category theory|Model theory|Table of logic symbols|Logic alphabet}}
Mathematical abstraction began as a process of extracting the underlying [[essence]] of a mathematical concept,&lt;ref&gt;Robert B. Ash. A Primer of Abstract Mathematics. Cambridge University Press, Jan 1, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The New American Encyclopedic Dictionary. Edited by Edward Thomas Roe, Le Roy Hooker, Thomas W. Handford. Pg [https://books.google.com/books?id=KhQLAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA34 34]&lt;/ref&gt; removing any dependence on real world objects with which it might originally have been connected,&lt;ref&gt;The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume 1. By Sir Isaac Newton, John Machin. Pg 12.&lt;/ref&gt; and generalizing it so that it has wider applications or matching among other abstract descriptions of equivalent [[phenomena]]. Two abstract areas of modern mathematics are [[category theory]] and [[model theory]]. Bertrand Russell,&lt;ref&gt;In The Scientific Outlook (1931)&lt;/ref&gt; said, "''Ordinary language is totally unsuited for expressing what physics really asserts, since the words of everyday life are not sufficiently abstract. Only mathematics and mathematical logic can say as little as the physicist means to say''". Though, one can substituted mathematics for real world objects, and wander off through equation after equation, and can build a concept structure which has no relation to reality.&lt;ref&gt;Mathematics simplified and made attractive: or, The laws of motion explained. By Thomas Fisher. Pg 15. (cf. ''But an abstraction not founded upon, and not consonant with [[Nature (philosophy)|Nature]] and ''([[Logical truth|Logical]])'' [[Truth]], would be a [[falsity]], an [[insanity]].'')&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Symbolic logic]] studies the purely formal properties of strings of symbols.  The interest in this area springs from two sources.  First, the notation used in symbolic logic can be seen as representing the words used in [[philosophical logic]].  Second, the rules for manipulating symbols found in symbolic logic can be implemented on a [[computer|computing machine]]. Symbolic logic is usually divided into two subfields, [[propositional logic]] and [[predicate logic]].  Other logics of interest include [[temporal logic]], [[modal logic]] and [[fuzzy logic]]. The area of symbolic logic called [[propositional logic]], also called ''propositional calculus'', studies the properties of sentences formed from [[logical constant|constants]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Here a [[logical constant]] is a symbol in symbolic logic that has the same meaning in all models, such as the symbol "=" for "equals".&lt;br&gt;A ''constant'', in a mathematical context, is a [[Mathematical constant|number that arises naturally in mathematics]], such as π or e;  Such [[constant (mathematics)|mathematics constant]] value do not change. It can mean polynomial [[constant term]]  (the term of degree 0) or the [[constant of integration]], a free parameter arising in integration.&lt;br&gt; Related, the [[physical constant]] are a physical quantity generally believed to be universal and unchanging. [[Constant (programming)|Programming constants]] are a values that, unlike a variable, cannot be reassociated with a different value.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[logical operator]]s. The corresponding logical operations are known, respectively, as [[logical conjunction|conjunction]], [[logical disjunction|disjunction]], [[material conditional]], [[biconditional]], and [[negation]].  These operators are denoted as [[reserved word|keywords]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Though not an [[index term]], keywords are terms that represent information. A keyword is a word with special meaning (this is a semantic definition), while syntactically these are [[terminal symbol]]s in the phrase grammar. See [[reserved word]] for the related concept.&lt;/ref&gt; and by symbolic notation.

Some of the introduced mathematical logic notation during this time included the set of symbols used in [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]]. This was created by [[George Boole]] in 1854. Boole himself did not see logic as a branch of mathematics, but it has come to be encompassed anyway. Symbols found in Boolean algebra include &lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt; (AND), &lt;math&gt;\lor&lt;/math&gt; (OR), and &lt;math&gt;\lnot&lt;/math&gt; (''not'').  With these symbols, and letters to represent different [[truth value]]s, one can make logical statements such as &lt;math&gt;a\lor\lnot a=1&lt;/math&gt;, that is "(''a'' is true OR ''a'' is ''not'' true) is true", meaning it is true that ''a'' is either true or not true (i.e. false). Boolean algebra has many practical uses as it is, but it also was the start of what would be a large set of symbols to be used in logic.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Most of these symbols can be found in [[propositional calculus]], a [[formal system]] described as &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}\ (\Alpha,\ \Omega,\ \Zeta,\ \Iota)&lt;/math&gt;.  &lt;math&gt;\Alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the set of elements, such as the ''a'' in the example with Boolean algebra above.  &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is the set that contains the subsets that contain operations, such as &lt;math&gt;\lor&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt;.  &lt;math&gt;\Zeta&lt;/math&gt; contains the [[inference rules]], which are the rules dictating how inferences may be logically made, and &lt;math&gt;\Iota&lt;/math&gt; contains the [[axioms]]. See also: [[Propositional calculus#propcalc table|Basic and Derived Argument Forms]].&lt;/ref&gt; Predicate logic, originally called ''predicate calculus'', expands on propositional logic by the introduction of [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Usually denoted by ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', or other lowercase letters&lt;br&gt;
Here a symbols that represents a quantity in a mathematical expression, a [[Variable (mathematics)|mathematical variable]] as used in many sciences.&lt;br&gt;
Variables can be symbolic name associated with a value and whose associated value may be changed, known in computer science as a [[Variable (computer science)|variable reference]]. A ''variable'' can also be the [[operationalization|operationalized]] way in which the attribute is represented for further [[data processing]] (e.g., a logical set of attributes). See also: [[Dependent and independent variables]] in statistics.&lt;/ref&gt; and by sentences containing variables, called [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Usually denoted by an uppercase letter followed by a list of variables, such as P(''x'') or Q(''y'',''z'')&lt;br&gt;
Here a [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|mathematical logic predicate]], a fundamental concept in first-order logic. [[Predicate (grammar)|Grammatical predicates]] are grammatical components of a sentence.&lt;br&gt;
Related is the [[syntactic predicate]] in parser technology which are guidelines for the parser process. In computer programming, a [[branch predication]] allows a choice to execute or not to execute a given instruction based on the content of a machine register.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, predicate logic allows [[Quantifiers (logic)|quantifiers]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Representing ALL and EXISTS&lt;/ref&gt; With these [[logic symbol]]s and additional [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifier]]s from predicate logic,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;e.g. ∃ for "there exists" and ∀ for "for all"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Validity (logic)|valid]] [[Mathematical proof|proofs]] [[Argumentation theory#Mathematical argumentation|can be made]] that are [[Absurdity|irrationally artificial]],&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See also: [[Dialetheism]], [[Contradiction]], and [[Paradox]]&lt;/ref&gt; but syntactical.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Related, [[dict:facetious|facetious]] [[abstract nonsense]] describes certain kinds of arguments and methods related to category theory which resembles comical [[Non sequitur (literary device)|literary non sequitur devices]] (not [[Non sequitur (logic)|illogical non sequiturs]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gödel incompleteness notation====
{{see also|Proof sketch for Gödel's first incompleteness theorem}}

{{rquote|right|To every [[Omega-consistent|ω-consistent]] recursive class κ of ''formulae'' there correspond recursive ''class signs r'', such that neither ''v'' Gen ''r'' nor Neg (''v'' Gen ''r'') belongs to Flg (κ) (where ''v'' is the ''free variable'' of ''r'').| Kurt Gödel&lt;ref&gt;Proposition VI, ''[[On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems|On Formally Undecidable Propositions in ''Principia Mathematica'' and Related Systems I]]'' (1931)&lt;/ref&gt;}}
While proving his [[incompleteness theorems]],&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] shows that [[Hilbert's program]] to find a complete and consistent set of [[axiom]]s for all [[mathematics]] is impossible, giving a contested negative answer to [[Hilbert's second problem]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kurt Gödel]] created an alternative to the symbols normally used in logic.  He used [[Gödel number]]s, which were numbers that represented operations with set numbers, and variables with the prime numbers greater than 10.  With Gödel numbers, logic statements can be broken down into a number sequence.  Gödel then took this one step farther, taking the ''n'' prime numbers and putting them to the power of the numbers in the sequence.  These numbers were then multiplied together to get the final product, giving every logic statement its own number.&lt;ref&gt;Casti, John L. ''5 Golden Rules''. New York: MJF Books, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For example, take the statement "There exists a number ''x'' such that it is not ''y''".  Using the symbols of propositional calculus, this would become:  &lt;math&gt;(\exists x)(x=\lnot y)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
If the Gödel numbers replace the symbols, it becomes:&lt;math&gt;\{8, 4, 11, 9, 8, 11, 5, 1, 13, 9\}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br&gt; There are ten numbers, so the ten prime numbers are found and these are: &lt;math&gt;\{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29\}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br&gt; Then, the Gödel numbers are made the powers of the respective primes and multiplied, giving: &lt;math&gt;2^8\times3^4\times5^{11}\times7^9\times11^8\times13^{11}\times17^5\times19^1\times23^{13}\times29^9&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br&gt; The resulting number is approximately &lt;math&gt;3.096262735\times10^{78}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary notation and topics===
{{see also|Contemporary era}}

====Early 20th-century notation====
Abstraction of notation is an ongoing process and the historical development of many mathematical topics exhibits a progression from the concrete to the abstract. Various [[set notation]]s would be developed for fundamental object [[Set (mathematics)|sets]]. Around 1924, [[David Hilbert]] and [[Richard Courant]] published "[[Methoden der mathematischen Physik|Methods of mathematical physics. Partial differential equations]]".&lt;ref&gt;Gr. ''Methoden Der Mathematischen Physik''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926, [[Oskar Klein]] and [[Walter Gordon (physicist)|Walter Gordon]] proposed the [[Klein–Gordon equation]] to describe relativistic particles.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The Klein–Gordon equation is:&lt;br&gt;{{Equation box 1|indent =:|equation =&lt;math&gt; \frac {1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} \psi - \nabla^2 \psi + \frac {m^2 c^2}{\hbar^2} \psi = 0. &lt;/math&gt; |cellpadding= 6|border = 0|border colour = black|background colour=white}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first formulation of a [[quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] describing radiation and matter interaction is due to [[Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac]], who, during 1920, was first able to compute the coefficient of spontaneous emission of an [[atom]].&lt;ref name=dirac&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; physicists came to believe that, in principle, it would be possible to perform any computation for any physical process involving photons and charged particles.

In 1931, [[Alexandru Proca]] developed the [[Proca equation]] ([[Euler–Lagrange equation]])&lt;ref group="note"&gt;That is,&lt;br&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; At higher orders in the series infinities emerged, making such computations meaningless and casting serious doubts on the internal consistency of the theory itself. With no solution for this problem known at the time, it appeared that a fundamental incompatibility existed between [[special relativity]] and [[quantum mechanics]].

In the 1930s, the double-struck capital Z for integer number sets was created by [[Edmund Landau]]. [[Nicolas Bourbaki]] created the double-struck capital Q for rational number sets. In 1935, Gerhard Gentzen made [[universal quantifier]]s. In 1936, [[Tarski's undefinability theorem]] is stated by [[Alfred Tarski]] and proved.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The theorem applies more generally to any sufficiently strong formal system, showing that truth in the standard model of the system cannot be defined within the system.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938, [[Kurt Gödel|Gödel]] proposes the [[constructible universe]] in the paper "''[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1077160/ The Consistency of the Axiom of Choice and of the Generalized Continuum-Hypothesis]''". [[André Weil]] and [[Nicolas Bourbaki]] would develop the [[empty set]] sign in 1939. That same year, [[Nathan Jacobson]] would coin the double-struck capital C for [[complex number]] sets.

Around the 1930s, [[Voigt notation]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Named to honor Voigt's 1898 work.&lt;/ref&gt; would be developed for [[multilinear algebra]] as a way to represent a [[symmetric tensor]] by reducing its order. [[Schoenflies notation|Schönflies notation]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Named after [[Arthur Moritz Schoenflies]]&lt;/ref&gt; became one of two conventions used to describe [[point group]]s (the other being [[Hermann–Mauguin notation]]). Also in this time, [[van der Waerden notation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Spinoranalyse|author=Van der Waerden B.L.|journal=Nachr. Ges. Wiss.

[[Arend Heyting]] would introduce [[Heyting algebra]] and [[Heyting arithmetic]].

The arrow, e.g., →, was developed for [[function notation]] in 1936 by [[Øystein Ore]] to denote images of specific elements.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See [[Galois connection]]s.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Oystein Ore would also write "[https://books.google.com/books?id=Sl_6BPp7S0AC Number Theory and Its History]".&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in 1940, it took its present form, e.g., ''f: X → Y'', through the work of [[Witold Hurewicz]]. [[Werner Heisenberg]], in 1941, proposed the [[S-matrix theory]] of particle interactions.

[[File:Diracb.jpg|thumbnail|[[Paul Dirac]], pictured here, made fundamental contributions to the early development of both quantum mechanics and [[quantum electrodynamics]].]]
[[Bra–ket notation]] ([[Dirac notation]]) is a standard notation for describing [[quantum state]]s, composed of [[bracket|angle brackets]] and [[vertical bar]]s. It can also be used to denote abstract [[vector space|vectors]] and [[linear functional]]s. It is so called because the [[inner product]] (or [[dot product]] on a complex vector space) of two states is denoted by a {{langle}}bra|ket{{rangle}}&lt;ref group="note"&gt;&lt;math&gt;\langle\phi|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; consisting of a left part, ⟨''φ''|, and a right part, |''ψ''⟩.

Bra–ket notation is widespread in [[quantum mechanics]]: almost every phenomenon that is explained using quantum mechanics—including a large portion of [[modern physics]]—is usually explained with the help of bra–ket notation. The notation establishes an encoded abstract representation-independence, producing a versatile specific representation (e.g., ''x'', or ''p'', or [[eigenfunction]] base) without much [[dict:ado|ado]], or excessive reliance on, the [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]] of the [[linear space]]s involved. The overlap expression ⟨''φ''|''ψ''⟩  is typically interpreted as the [[probability amplitude]] for the [[Quantum state|state]] ''[[ψ]]'' to [[wavefunction collapse|collapse]] into the state ''[[Φ#Use as a symbol|ϕ]]''.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was developed by [[Richard Feynman]] for the study of [[Dirac field]]s in [[quantum field theory]].

In 1948, [[Valentine Bargmann]] and [[Eugene Wigner]] proposed the [[relativistic wave equations|relativistic]] [[Bargmann–Wigner equations]] to describe [[free particle]]s and the equations are in the form of multi-component [[spinor field]] [[wavefunction]]s. In 1950, [[W. V. D. Hodge|William Vallance Douglas Hodge]] presented "[[Hodge conjecture|The topological invariants of algebraic varieties]]" at the Proceedings of the International Congress of Mathematicians. Between 1954 and 1957, [[Eugenio Calabi]] worked on the [[Calabi conjecture]] for [[Kähler metric]]s and the development of [[Calabi–Yau manifold]]s. In 1957, [[Tullio Regge]] formulated the mathematical property of potential scattering in the [[Schrödinger equation]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;That the scattering amplitude can be thought of as an analytic function of the angular momentum, and that the position of the poles determine power-law growth rates of the amplitude in the purely mathematical region of large values of the cosine of the scattering angle.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stanley Mandelstam]], along with Regge, did the initial development of the [[Regge theory]] of strong interaction phenomenology. In 1958, [[Murray Gell-Mann]] and [[Richard Feynman]], along with [[George Sudarshan]] and [[Robert Marshak]], deduced the [[chiral|chiral structures]] of the [[weak interaction]] in physics. [[Geoffrey Chew]], along with others, would promote matrix notation for the [[strong interaction]], and the associated [[Bootstrapping (physics)|bootstrap principle]], in 1960. In the 1960s, [[set-builder notation]] was developed for describing a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] by stating the properties that its members must satisfy. Also in the 1960s, tensors are abstracted within [[category theory]] by means of the concept of [[monoidal category]]. Later, [[multi-index notation]] eliminates conventional notions used in [[multivariable calculus]], [[partial differential equation]]s, and the theory of [[distribution (mathematics)|distributions]], by abstracting the concept of an integer [[index notation|index]] to an ordered [[tuple]] of indices.

In the modern mathematics of [[special relativity]], [[electromagnetism]] and [[Wave|wave theory]], the [[d'Alembert operator]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;That is, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\Box&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Also known as the [[d'Alembertian]] or [[wave operator]].&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[Laplace operator]] of [[Minkowski space]]. The [[Levi-Civita symbol]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Also known as, "[[permutation symbol]]" (see: [[permutation]]), "[[antisymmetric symbol]]" (see: [[Self-complementary graph|antisymmetric]]), or "[[alternating symbol]]"&lt;/ref&gt; is used in [[tensor calculus]].

After the full [[Lorentz covariance]] formulations that were finite at any order in a perturbation series of quantum electrodynamics, [[Sin-Itiro Tomonaga]], [[Julian Schwinger]] and [[Richard Feynman]] were jointly awarded with a [[Nobel prize in physics]] in 1965.&lt;ref name=nobel65&gt;{{cite web | title = The Nobel Prize in Physics 1965 | publisher = Nobel Foundation | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1965/index.html|accessdate=2008-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their contributions, and those of [[Freeman Dyson]], were about covariant and [[gauge invariant]] formulations of quantum electrodynamics that allow computations of observables at any order of [[Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]]. Feynman's mathematical technique, based on his [[Feynman diagram|diagrams]], initially seemed very different from the field-theoretic, [[Operator (physics)|operator]]-based approach of Schwinger and Tomonaga, but [[Freeman Dyson]] later showed that the two approaches were equivalent. [[Renormalization]], the need to attach a physical meaning at certain divergences appearing in the theory through [[integral]]s, has subsequently become one of the fundamental aspects of [[quantum field theory]] and has come to be seen as a criterion for a theory's general acceptability. Quantum electrodynamics has served as the model and template for subsequent quantum field theories. [[Peter Higgs]], [[Jeffrey Goldstone]], and others, [[Sheldon Glashow]], [[Steven Weinberg]] and [[Abdus Salam]] independently showed how the [[weak nuclear force]] and quantum electrodynamics could be merged into a single [[electroweak force]]. In the late 1960s, the [[particle zoo]] was composed of the then known [[elementary particle]]s before the discovery of [[quarks]].

The Higgs mechanism is believed to give rise to the [[mass]]es of all the [[elementary particle]]s in the Standard Model.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the electroweak theory became widely accepted and Glashow, Salam, and Weinberg shared the 1979 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for discovering it. The theory of the [[strong interaction]], to which many contributed, acquired its modern form around 1973–74. With the establishment of [[quantum chromodynamics]], a finalized a set of fundamental and exchange particles, which allowed for the establishment of a "[[Standard Model|standard model]]" based on the mathematics of [[Gauge theory|gauge invariance]], which successfully described all forces except for gravity, and which remains generally accepted within the domain to which it is designed to be applied. In the late 1970s, [[William Thurston]] introduced [[hyperbolic geometry]] into the [[Knot theory|study of knots]] with the [[geometrization conjecture|hyperbolization theorem]]. The [[orbifold notation]] system, invented by Thurston, has been developed for representing types of [[symmetry groups]] in two-dimensional spaces of constant curvature. In 1978, [[Shing-Tung Yau]] deduced that the [[Calabi conjecture]] have [[Ricci-flat manifold|Ricci flat]] metrics. In 1979, [[Daniel Friedan]] showed that the equations of motions of [[string theory]] are abstractions of [[Einstein equations]] of [[General Relativity]].

The [[first superstring revolution]] is composed of mathematical equations developed between 1984 and 1986. In 1984, [[Vaughan Jones]] deduced the [[Jones polynomial]] and subsequent contributions from [[Edward Witten]], [[Maxim Kontsevich]], and others, revealed deep connections between knot theory and mathematical methods in [[statistical mechanics]] and quantum field theory. According to [[string theory]], all particles in the "particle zoo" have a common ancestor, namely a [[String (physics)|vibrating string]]. In 1985, [[Philip Candelas]], [[Gary Horowitz]],&lt;ref&gt;http://web.physics.ucsb.edu/~gary/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Strominger]], and Edward Witten would publish "Vacuum configurations for superstrings"&lt;ref&gt;Nuclear Physics B 258: 46–74, {{Bibcode|1985NuPhB.258...46C}}, {{doi|10.1016/0550-3213(85)90602-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the [[tetrad formalism]] ([[tetrad (index notation)|tetrad index notation]]) would be introduced as an approach to [[general relativity]] that replaces the choice of a [[coordinate basis]] by the less restrictive choice of a local basis for the tangent bundle.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;A locally defined set of four linearly independent [[vector field]]s called a [[Tetrad (general relativity)|tetrad]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1=De Felice|first1=F.|last2=Clarke|first2=C.J.S. |title=Relativity on Curved Manifolds| year=1990|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, [[Roger Penrose]] would propose [[Penrose graphical notation]] ([[tensor diagram notation]]) as a, usually handwritten, visual depiction of [[multilinear function]]s or [[tensor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"Quantum invariants of knots and 3-manifolds" by V. G. Turaev (1994), page 71&lt;/ref&gt; Penrose would also introduce [[abstract index notation]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;His usage of the Einstein summation was in order to offset the inconvenience in describing [[tensor contraction|contractions]] and [[covariant derivative|covariant differentiation]] in modern abstract tensor notation, while maintaining explicit [[covariance]] of the expressions involved.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, Edward Witten suggested [[M-theory]] and subsequently used it to explain some observed [[Duality (mathematics)|dualities]], initiating the [[second superstring revolution]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See also: [[String theory landscape]] and [[Swampland (physics)|Swampland]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Horton Conway|John Conway]] would further various notations, including the [[Conway chained arrow notation]], the [[Conway notation (knot theory)|Conway notation of knot theory]], and the [[Conway polyhedron notation]]. The [[Coxeter notation]] system classifies symmetry groups, describing the angles between with fundamental reflections of a [[Coxeter group]]. It uses a bracketed notation, with modifiers to indicate certain subgroups.  The notation is named after [[H. S. M. Coxeter]] and [[Norman Johnson (mathematician)|Norman Johnson]] more comprehensively defined it.

In 1962, [[Kenneth E. Iverson]] developed an integral part notation that became known as [[Iverson Notation]] for manipulating arrays that he taught to his students, and described in his book ''[[A Programming Language]]''. In 1970, [[Edgar F. Codd|E.F. Codd]] proposed [[relational algebra]] as a [[relational model|relational model of data]] for [[database query language]]s.

In the history of mathematical notation, ideographic symbol notation has come full circle with the rise of computer visualization systems. The notations can be applied to abstract visualizations, such as for rendering some projections of a [[Calabi-Yau]] [[manifold]]. Examples of [[Information visualization|abstract visualization]] which properly belong to the mathematical imagination can be found in [[computer graphics]]. The need for such models abounds, for example, when the measures for the subject of study are actually [[random variable]]s and not really ordinary [[mathematical function]]s.

Each idempotent relation is necessarily [[transitive relation|transitive]], as the latter means&amp;nbsp;''R''&amp;nbsp;∘&amp;nbsp;''R''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''R''.

For example, the relation&amp;nbsp;&lt; on [[rational number|ℚ]] is idempotent. In contrast,&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;on [[integer number|ℤ]] is not, since (&lt;)&amp;nbsp;∘&amp;nbsp;(&lt;)&amp;nbsp;[[Superset|⊇]]&amp;nbsp;(&lt;) does not hold: e.g. 1&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;2, but 1&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;2 is false for every&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;ℤ.

Idempotent relations have been used as an example to illustrate the application of Mechanized Formalisation
of mathematics using the interactive theorem prover Isabelle/HOL. Besides checking the mathematical properties of finite idempotent relations, an algorithm for counting the number of idempotent relations has been derived in Isabelle/HOL.

In the [[ISO/IEC 80000|International System of Quantities]], the '''level''' of a quantity is the [[logarithm]] of the ratio of the value of that quantity to a reference value of the same quantity.&lt;ref&gt;[[ISO 80000-3|ISO 80000-3:2006, ''Quantities and units'', Part 2: Space and Time]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. M. Carey, Sound Sources and Levels in the Ocean, IEEE J Oceanic Eng 31:61–75(2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Examples are the various types of [[Sound level (disambiguation)|sound level]]&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt;: [[sound power level]] (literally, the level of the [[sound power]], abbreviated SWL), [[sound exposure level]] (SEL), [[sound pressure level]] (SPL) and [[particle velocity level]] (SVL).&lt;ref&gt;[[ISO 80000-8|ISO 80000-8:2007, ''Quantities and units'', Part 8: Acoustics]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
Level and its units are defined in [[ISO 80000-3#Logarithmic quantities and units|ISO 80000-3]].

===Level===
Level of a quantity ''Q'', denoted ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''Q''&lt;/sub&gt;, is defined by&lt;ref&gt;ANSI S1.1-2013 Acoustical Terminology, entry 3.01&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;L_Q = \log_r\!\left(\frac{Q}{Q_0}\right)\!,&lt;/math&gt;
where
*''r'' is the base of the logarithm;
*''Q'' is the quantity;
*''Q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the reference value of ''Q''.

===Level of a root-power quantity{{anchor|Root-power quantities|Field quantities}}===
The level of a ''root-power'' quantity (also known as a ''field'' quantity), denoted ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''F''&lt;/sub&gt;, is defined by &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Francesco_Damore3/publication/316104462_Effect_of_moisturizer_and_lubricant_on_the_finger-surface_sliding_contact_tribological_and_dynamical_analysis/links/58f9e4f2a6fdcc73cf270e91/Effect-of-moisturizer-and-lubricant-on-the-finger-surface-sliding-contact-tribological-and-dynamical-analysis.pdf e Industriale, F. D. I. C., &amp; D'Amore, F. Effect of moisturizer and lubricant on the finger‒surface sliding contact: tribological and dynamical analysis.]&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;L_F = \log_{\mathrm{e}}\!\left(\frac{F}{F_0}\right)\!,&lt;/math&gt;
where
*''F'' is the root-power quantity, proportional to the square root of power quantity;
*''F''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the reference value of ''F''.
For the level of a root-power quantity, the base of the logarithm is {{nowrap|1=''r'' = [[e (mathematical constant)|e]]}}.

===Level of a power quantity{{anchor|Power quantities}}===
Level of a ''power'' quantity, denoted ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''P''&lt;/sub&gt;, is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;L_P = \log_{\mathrm{e}^2}\!\left(\frac{P}{P_0}\right) = \frac{1}{2} \ln\!\left(\frac{P}{P_0}\right)\!,&lt;/math&gt;
where
*''P'' is the power quantity;
*''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the reference value of ''P''.
For the level of a power quantity, the base of the logarithm is {{nowrap|1=''r'' = e&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref&gt;Ainslie, M. A. A Century of Sonar: Planetary Oceanography, Underwater Noise Monitoring, and the Terminology of Underwater Sound. [http://acousticstoday.org/a-century-of-sonar-planetary-oceanography-underwater-noise-monitoring-and-the-terminology-of-underwater-sound-michael-a-ainslie/ Acoustics Today], 23 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Units of level==

===Power level ===
{{see also|Decibel#Conversions|Neper#Units}}

The [[neper]], [[Decibel|bel]], and [[decibel]] (one tenth of a bel) are units of level that are often applied to such quantities as power, intensity, or gain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Barry Taylor | year=1995 | title=Guide for the Use of the International System of Units (SI): The Metric System | publisher=Diane Publishing Co. | page=28 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I3HRRrDd1n8C&amp;pg=PA28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The neper, bel, and decibel are defined by
*{{nowrap|1=Np = 1}};
*{{nowrap|1=B = {{sfrac|1|2}} log&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;10 Np}};
*{{nowrap|1=dB = 0.1 B = {{sfrac|1|20}} log&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;10 Np}}.

If ''F'' is a root-power quantity:
:&lt;math&gt;L_F = \log_{\mathrm{e}}\!\left(\frac{F}{F_0}\right)\!~\mathrm{Np} = 2 \log_{10}\!\left(\frac{F}{F_0}\right)\!~\mathrm{B} = 20 \log_{10}\!\left(\frac{F}{F_0}\right)\!~\mathrm{dB}.&lt;/math&gt;

If ''P'' is a power quantity:
:&lt;math&gt;L_P = \frac{1}{2} \log_{\mathrm{e}}\!\left(\frac{P}{P_0}\right)\!~\mathrm{Np} = \log_{10}\!\left(\frac{P}{P_0}\right)\!~\mathrm{B} = 10 \log_{10}\!\left(\frac{P}{P_0}\right)\!~\mathrm{dB}.&lt;/math&gt;

If the power quantity ''P'' is proportional to ''F''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and if the reference value of the power quantity, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, is in the same proportion to ''F''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the levels ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''F''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''P''&lt;/sub&gt; are equal.

===Frequency level===
The [[Octave (electronics)|octave]] is a unit of level (specifically "frequency level",&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, H. (1934). Loudness, pitch and the timbre of musical tones and their relation to the intensity, the frequency and the overtone structure. The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 6(2), 59–69.&lt;/ref&gt; for {{nowrap|1=''r'' = 2}}) though that concept is seldom seen outside of the ANSI standard that defines it.&lt;ref&gt;[[ANSI/ASA S1.1-2013|ANSI/ASA S1.1-2013, ''Acoustical Terminology'']]&lt;/ref&gt; A [[semitone]] is one twelfth of an octave. A [[Cent (music)|cent]] is one hundredth of a semitone.

A '''Lie group integrator''' is a [[numerical integration]] [[numerical method|method]] for [[differential equation]]s built from [[coordinate-independent operation]]s such as [[Lie group action]]s on a [[manifold]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1207.0069|title=An introduction to Lie group integrators -- basics, new developments and applications|journal=Journal of Computational Physics|volume=257|issue=2014|pages=1040–1061|last1=Celledoni|first1=Elena|last2=Marthinsen|first2=Håkon|last3=Owren|first3=Brynjulf|year=2012|doi=10.1016/j.jcp.2012.12.031|bibcode=2014JCoPh.257.1040C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~mleok/pdf/mleok_scicade07.pdf|title=AN OVERVIEW OF LIE GROUP VARIATIONAL INTEGRATORS AND THEIR APPLICATIONS TO OPTIMAL CONTROL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Iserles|first=Arieh|last2=Munthe-Kaas|first2=Hans Z.|last3=Nørsett|first3=Syvert P.|last4=Zanna|first4=Antonella|date=2000-01-01|title=Lie-group methods|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/acta-numerica/article/liegroup-methods/856125FF1EAF7762DEF6E37EEBA9CA5F|journal=Acta Numerica|volume=9|pages=215–365|issn=1474-0508}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have been used for the [[computer animation|animation]] and control of [[vehicle]]s in [[computer graphics]] and [[control system]]s/[[artificial intelligence]] research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/Projects/LieGroupIntegrators/paper.pdf|title=Lie Group Integrators for the animation and control of vehicles}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These tasks are particularly difficult because they feature [[nonholonomic]] [[Constraint (classical mechanics)|constraint]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3676">'''List of combinatorial computational geometry topics''' enumerates the topics of [[computational geometry]] that states problems in terms of geometric objects as [[discrete mathematics|discrete]] entities and hence the methods of their solution are mostly theories and [[algorithm]]s of [[combinatorics|combinatorial]] character.

See [[List of numerical computational geometry topics]] for another flavor of computational geometry that deals with geometric objects as continuous entities and applies methods and algorithms of nature characteristic to [[numerical analysis]].

{{main|Duality (mathematics)}}

In [[mathematics]], a '''duality''', generally speaking, translates concepts, theorems or mathematical structures into other concepts, theorems or structures, in a one-to-one fashion, often (but not always) by means of an [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]] operation: if the dual of ''A'' is ''B'', then the dual of ''B'' is ''A''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30603">This is a list of selected [[geodesic polyhedra]] and [[Goldberg polyhedra]], two infinite classes of [[polyhedra]]. Geodesic polyhedra and Goldberg polyhedra are [[polyhedral dual|duals]] of each other. The geodesic and Goldberg polyhedra are parameterized by integers ''m'' and ''n'', with &lt;math&gt;m &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;. ''T'' is the triangulation number, which is equal to &lt;math&gt;T = m^2 + mn + n^2&lt;/math&gt;.

This is a list of artists who actively explored [[Mathematics and art|mathematics in their artworks]].&lt;ref name="Feature Column AMS"/&gt; [[Art]] forms practised by these artists include [[Mathematics and art|painting]], [[Mathematical sculpture|sculpture]], [[mathematics and architecture|architecture]], [[mathematics and fiber arts|textiles]] and [[origami]].

Some artists such as [[Piero della Francesca]] and [[Luca Pacioli]] went so far as to write books on [[mathematics]] in art. Della Francesca wrote books on [[solid geometry]] and the emerging field of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], including ''De Prospectiva Pingendi (On Perspective for Painting)'', ''Trattato d’Abaco (Abacus Treatise)'', and ''De corporibus regularibus (Regular Solids)'',&lt;ref&gt;Piero della Francesca, ''De Prospectiva Pingendi'', ed. G. Nicco Fasola, 2 vols., Florence (1942).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Piero della Francesca, ''Trattato d'Abaco'', ed. G. Arrighi, Pisa (1970).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Piero della Francesca, ''L'opera "De corporibus regularibus" di Pietro Franceschi detto della Francesca usurpata da Fra Luca Pacioli'', ed. G. Mancini, Rome, (1916).&lt;/ref&gt; while Pacioli wrote ''[[De divina proportione]] (On Divine Proportion)'', with illustrations by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], at the end of the fifteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Swetz |first1=Frank J. |last2=Katz |first2=Victor J. |title=Mathematical Treasures - De Divina Proportione, by Luca Pacioli |url=http://www.maa.org/publications/periodicals/convergence/mathematical-treasures-de-divina-proportione-by-luca-pacioli |publisher=Mathematical Association of America |accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Merely making accepted use of some aspect of mathematics such as [[perspective (geometry)|perspective]] does not qualify an artist for admission to this list.

The term "fine art" is used conventionally to cover the output of artists who produce a combination of paintings, drawings and sculptures.

In [[mathematics]], the [[simple Lie group]]s were first classified by [[Wilhelm Killing]] and later perfected by [[Élie Cartan]]. This classification is often referred to as Killing-Cartan classification. 

The list of simple Lie groups can be used to read off the list of [[simple Lie algebra]]s and [[Riemannian symmetric space]]s.  See also the [[table of Lie groups]] for a smaller list of groups that commonly occur in [[theoretical physics]], and the [[Bianchi classification]] for groups of dimension at most 3. 

== Simple Lie groups ==

Unfortunately, there is no universally accepted definition of a [[simple Lie group]]. In particular, it is not always defined as a Lie group that is [[simple group|simple]] as an abstract group. Authors differ on whether a simple Lie group has to be connected, or on whether it is allowed to have a non-trivial center, or on whether '''R''' is a simple Lie group. 

The most common definition is that a Lie group is simple if it is connected, non-abelian, and every closed ''connected'' normal subgroup is either the identity or the whole group. In particular, simple groups are allowed to have a non-trivial center, but '''R''' is not simple. 

In this article the connected simple Lie groups with trivial center are listed.  Once these are known, the ones with non-trivial center are easy to list as follows. Any simple Lie group with trivial center has a [[covering space#universal covers|universal cover]], whose center is the fundamental group of the simple Lie group. The corresponding simple Lie groups with non-trivial center can be obtained as quotients of this universal cover by a subgroup of the center.

== Simple Lie algebras ==

The Lie algebra of a simple Lie group is a simple Lie algebra. This is a one-to-one correspondence between connected simple Lie groups with [[Triviality (mathematics)|trivial]] center and simple Lie algebras of dimension greater than 1. (Authors differ on whether the one-dimensional Lie algebra should be counted as simple.)

Over the complex numbers the semisimple Lie algebras are classified by their [[Dynkin diagram]]s, of types "ABCDEFG". If ''L'' is a real simple Lie algebra, its complexification is a simple complex Lie algebra, unless ''L'' is already 
the complexification of a Lie algebra, in which case the complexification of ''L'' is a product of two copies of ''L''. This reduces the problem of classifying the real simple Lie algebras to that of finding all the [[real form]]s of each complex simple Lie algebra (i.e., real Lie algebras whose complexification is the given complex Lie algebra). There are always at least 2 such forms: a split form and a compact form, and there are usually a few others. The different real forms correspond to the classes of automorphisms of order at most 2 of the complex Lie algebra.

== Symmetric spaces ==

Symmetric spaces are classified as follows. 

First, the universal cover of a symmetric space is still symmetric, so we can reduce to the case of simply connected symmetric spaces. (For example, the universal cover of a real projective plane is a sphere.)

Second, the product of symmetric spaces is symmetric, so we may as well just classify the irreducible simply connected ones (where irreducible means they cannot be written as a product of smaller symmetric spaces). 

The irreducible simply connected symmetric spaces are the real line, and exactly two symmetric spaces corresponding to  each ''non-compact'' simple Lie group ''G'',
one compact and one non-compact. The non-compact one is a cover of the quotient of ''G'' by a maximal compact subgroup ''H'', and the compact one is a cover of the quotient of
the compact form of ''G'' by the same subgroup ''H''. This duality between compact and non-compact symmetric spaces is a generalization of the well known duality between spherical and hyperbolic geometry.

== Hermitian symmetric spaces ==

A symmetric space with a compatible complex structure is called Hermitian.  The compact simply connected irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces fall into 4 infinite families with 2 exceptional ones left over, and each has a non-compact dual. In addition the complex plane is also a Hermitian symmetric space; this gives the complete list of irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces.

The four families are the types A&amp;nbsp;III, B&amp;nbsp;I and D&amp;nbsp;I for {{nowrap|1=''p'' = 2}}, D&amp;nbsp;III, and C&amp;nbsp;I, and the two exceptional ones are types E&amp;nbsp;III and E&amp;nbsp;VII of complex dimensions 16 and 27.

== Notation ==

&lt;math&gt; \mathbb {R, C, H, O} &lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; stand for the real numbers, complex numbers, [[quaternions]], and [[octonion]]s.

In the symbols such as ''E''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;26&lt;/sup&gt; for the exceptional groups, the exponent &amp;minus;26 is the signature of an invariant symmetric bilinear form that is negative definite on the maximal compact subgroup. It is equal to the dimension of the group minus twice the dimension of a maximal compact subgroup.

The fundamental group listed in the table below is the fundamental group of the simple group with trivial center. 
Other simple groups with the same Lie algebra correspond to subgroups of this fundamental group (modulo the action of the outer automorphism group).

==Notes==
:{{Note|Note†|†}} The group '''R''' is not simple as an abstract group, and according to most (but not all) definitions this is not a simple Lie group. Most authors do not count its Lie algebra as a simple Lie algebra. It is listed here so that the list of irreducible simply connected symmetric spaces is complete. Note that '''R''' is the only such non-compact symmetric space without a compact dual (although it has a compact quotient ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3792">'''Logical harmony''', a name coined by [[Michael Dummett]], is a supposed constraint on the [[rules of inference]] that can be used in a given [[logical system]].

==Overview&lt;!--'Prior's tonk' redirects here--&gt;==
The logician [[Gerhard Gentzen]] proposed that the meanings of logical [[Logical connective|connective]]s could be given by the rules for introducing them into discourse. For example, if one believes that ''the sky is blue'' and one also believes that ''grass is green'', then one can introduce the connective ''[[logical conjunction|and]]'' as follows: ''The sky is blue AND grass is green.''  Gentzen's idea was that having rules like this is what gives meaning to one's words, or at least to certain words. The idea has also been associated with [[Wittgenstein]]'s dictum that in many cases we can say, ''[[meaning is use]]''. Most contemporary logicians prefer to think that the [[introduction rule]]s and the [[elimination rule]]s for an expression are equally important.  In this case, ''and'' is  characterized by the following rules:
{| border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" align="center"
|-
! Intro
! colspan="2" | Elim
|-
|
{| border="0"
|-
| &lt;VAR&gt;P&lt;/VAR&gt; || &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; || &lt;VAR&gt;Q&lt;/VAR&gt;
|-
| colspan="4" style="border-top:2px solid black;" |
|-
| colspan="4" align="center" | &lt;VAR&gt;P&lt;/VAR&gt; and &lt;VAR&gt;Q&lt;/VAR&gt;
|}
|
{| border="0"
|-
| &lt;VAR&gt;P&lt;/VAR&gt; and &lt;VAR&gt;Q&lt;/VAR&gt;
|-
| style="border-top:2px solid black;" |
|-
| align="center"| &lt;VAR&gt;P&lt;/VAR&gt;
|}
|
{| border="0"
|-
| &lt;VAR&gt;P&lt;/VAR&gt; and &lt;VAR&gt;Q&lt;/VAR&gt;
|-
| style="border-top:2px solid black;" |
|-
| align="center"| &lt;VAR&gt;Q&lt;/VAR&gt;
|}
|}

An apparent problem with this was pointed out by [[Arthur Prior]]: Why can't we have an expression (call it "'''tonk'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;") whose introduction rule is that of OR (from "p" to "p tonk q") but whose elimination rule is that of AND (from "p tonk q" to "q")?  This lets us deduce anything at all from any starting point.  Prior suggested that this meant that inferential rules could ''not'' determine meaning.  He was answered by [[Nuel Belnap]], that even though introduction and elimination rules can constitute meaning, not just any pair of such rules will determine a meaningful expression—they must meet certain constraints, such as not allowing us to deduce any new truths in the old vocabulary.  These constraints are what Dummett was referring to.

Harmony, then, refers to certain constraints that a proof theory must let hold between introduction and elimination rules for it to be meaningful, or in other words, for its inference rules to be meaning-constituting.

The application of harmony to logic may be considered a special case; it makes sense to talk of harmony with respect to not only inferential systems, but also conceptual systems in human cognition, and to type systems in programming languages.

Semantics of this form has not provided a very great challenge to that sketched in Tarski's [[semantic theory of truth]], but many philosophers interested in reconstituting the semantics of logic in a way that respects [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s ''meaning is use'' have felt that harmony holds the key.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3311">'''Mathematical maturity''' is an [[Mathematical jargon|informal term]] used by [[mathematician]]s to refer to a mixture of mathematical experience and insight that cannot be directly taught. Instead, it comes from repeated exposure to mathematical concepts. It is a gauge of mathematics student's [[erudition]] in [[mathematical structure]]s and methods.
The topic is occasionally also addressed in literature in its own right.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lynn Arthur Steen]] (1983) "Developing Mathematical Maturity" pages 99 to 110 in ''The Future of College Mathematics: Proceedings of a Conference/Workshop on the First Two Years of College Mathematics'', Anthony Ralston editor,  Springer {{isbn|1-4612-5510-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==

Mathematical maturity has been defined in several different ways by various authors.

One definition has been given as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.larry.denenberg.com/math22/LectureA.pdf Math 22 Lecture A], Larry Denenberg&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|... fearlessness in the face of symbols: the ability to read and understand notation, to introduce clear and useful notation when appropriate (and not otherwise!), and a general facility of expression in the terse—but crisp and exact—language that mathematicians use to communicate ideas.}}

A broader list of characteristics of mathematical maturity has been given as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.msu.edu/course/lbs/119/simpson/goals_content.html LBS 119 Calculus II Course Goals], Lyman Briggs School of Science&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|
*the capacity to generalize from a specific example to broad concept 
*the capacity to handle increasingly abstract ideas 
*the ability to communicate mathematically by learning standard notation and acceptable style 
*a significant shift from learning by memorization to learning through understanding 
*the capacity to separate the key ideas from the less significant 
*the ability to link a geometrical representation with an analytic representation 
*the ability to translate verbal problems into mathematical problems 
*the ability to recognize a valid proof and detect 'sloppy' thinking 
*the ability to recognize mathematical patterns 
*the ability to move back and forth between  the geometrical (graph) and the analytical (equation)
*improving mathematical intuition by abandoning  naive assumptions and developing a more critical attitude}}

Finally, mathematical maturity has also been defined as an ability to do the following:&lt;ref&gt;[http://course1.winona.edu/KSuman/Dictionary/Fill%20Ins/Mathematical%20Maturity.htm A Set of Mathematical Equivoques], Ken Suman, Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Winona State University&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|
*make and use connections with other problems and other disciplines
*fill in missing details
*spot, correct and learn from mistakes
*winnow the chaff from the wheat, get to the crux, identify intent
*recognize and appreciate elegance
*think abstractly
*read, write and critique formal proofs
*draw a line between what you know and what you don’t know
*recognize patterns, themes, currents and eddies
*apply what you know in creative ways
*approximate appropriately
*teach yourself
*generalize
*remain focused
*bring instinct and intuition to bear when needed}}

'''Mathematical tables''' are lists of numbers showing the results of calculation with varying arguments. Before [[calculator]]s were cheap and plentiful, people would use such [[table (information)|tables]] to simplify and drastically speed up [[computation]]. Tables of logarithms and trigonometric functions were common in math and science textbooks.  Specialized tables were published for applications such as [[astronomy]], [[celestial navigation]] and [[statistics]].

To compute the [[sine]] function of 75 degrees, 9 minutes, 50 seconds&lt;ref&gt;The longitude of [[Philadelphia City Hall]]&lt;/ref&gt; using a table of trigonometric functions such as the Bernegger table from 1619 illustrated here, one might simply round up to 75 degrees, 10 minutes and then find the 10 minute entry on the 75 degree page, shown above-right, which is 0.9666746.

However, this answer is only accurate to four decimal places. If one wanted greater accuracy, one could [[interpolate]] linearly as follows:

From the Bernegger table:
:sin (75° 10′) = 0.9666746
:sin (75° 9′) = 0.9666001

The difference between these values is 0.0000745.

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute of arc, we multiply the difference by 50/60 to get a correction of (50/60)*0.0000745 ≈ 0.0000621; and then add that correction to sin (75° 9′) to get :

:sin (75° 9′ 50″) ≈ sin (75° 9′) + 0.0000621 = 0.9666001 + 0.0000621 = 0.9666622

A modern calculator gives sin (75° 9′ 50″) = 0.96666219991, so our interpolated answer is accurate to the 7-digit precision of the Bernegger table.

For tables with greater precision (more digits per value), higher order interpolation may be needed to get full accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Abramowitz and Stegun]] Handbook of Mathematical Functions, Introduction §4&lt;/ref&gt; In the era before electronic computers, interpolating table data in this manner was the only practical way to get high accuracy values of mathematical functions needed for applications such as navigation, astronomy and surveying.

To understand the importance of accuracy in applications like navigation note that at [[sea level]] one minute of arc along the Earth's [[equator]] or a [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]] (indeed, any [[great circle]]) equals approximately one [[nautical mile]] ({{convert|1.852|km|mi|disp=or|abbr=on}}).

==History and use==
The first tables of [[trigonometric functions]] known to be made were by [[Hipparchus]] (c.190  &amp;ndash; c.120 BCE) and [[Menelaus of Alexandria|Menelaus]] (c.70–140 CE), but both have been lost. Along with the [[Ptolemy's table of chords|surviving table of Ptolemy]] (c. 90 – c.168 CE), they were all tables of chords and not of half-chords, i.e. the [[sine]] function.&lt;ref name="mcs"/&gt; The [[Āryabhaṭa's sine table|table produced by the Indian mathematician Āryabhaṭa]] is considered the first sine table ever constructed.&lt;ref name="mcs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/HistTopics/Trigonometric_functions.html |title=The trigonometric functions|last=J J O'Connor and E F Robertson|date=June 1996 |accessdate=4 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Āryabhaṭa's table remained the standard sine table of ancient India. There were continuous attempts to improve the accuracy of this table, culminating in the discovery of the [[Madhava series|power series expansions]] of the sine and cosine functions by [[Madhava of Sangamagrama]] (c.1350 – c.1425), and the tabulation of a [[Madhava's sine table|sine table by Madhava]] with values accurate to seven or eight decimal places.

Tables of [[common logarithm]]s were used until the invention of computers and electronic calculators to do rapid multiplications, divisions, and exponentiations, including the extraction of ''n''th roots.

Mechanical special-purpose computers known as [[difference engine]]s were proposed in the 19th century to tabulate polynomial approximations of logarithmic functions &amp;ndash; i.e. to compute large logarithmic tables. This was motivated mainly by errors in logarithmic tables made by the [[human computer]]s of the time. Early digital computers were developed during World War II in part to produce specialized mathematical tables for aiming [[artillery]]. From 1972 onwards, with the launch and growing use of [[HP-35|scientific calculator]]s, most mathematical tables went out of use.

One of the last major efforts to construct such tables was the [[Mathematical Tables Project]] that was started in 1938 as a project of the Works Progress Administration (WPA),  employing 450 out-of-work clerks to tabulate higher mathematical functions, and lasted through World War II.

Tables of [[special functions]] are still used; for example, the use of tables of values of the [[cumulative distribution function]] of the [[normal distribution]] – so-called [[standard normal table]]s – remains commonplace today, especially in schools.

Creating tables stored in [[random-access memory]] is a common [[code optimization]] technique in computer programming, where the use of such tables  speeds up calculations in those cases where a [[Lookup table|table lookup]] is faster than the corresponding calculations (particularly if the computer in question doesn't have a hardware implementation of the calculations). In essence, one [[Space–time tradeoff|trades computing speed for the computer memory space]] required to store the tables.

Tables containing [[common logarithm]]s (base-10) were extensively used in computations prior to the advent of [[computer]]s and [[calculator]]s because logarithms convert problems of multiplication and division into much easier addition and subtraction problems. Base-10 logarithms have an additional property that is unique and useful: The common logarithm of numbers greater than one that differ only by a factor of a power of ten all have the same fractional part, known as the ''mantissa.'' Tables of common logarithms typically included only the [[significand|mantissas]]; the integer part of the logarithm, known as the ''characteristic,'' could easily be determined by counting digits in the original number.

The fractional part of the common logarithm of numbers greater than zero but less than one is just 1 minus the mantissa of the same number with the decimal point shifted to the right of the first non-zero digit. But same mantissa could be (and was) used for numbers less than one by offsetting the characteristic. Thus a single table of common logarithms can be used for the entire range of positive decimal numbers.&lt;ref&gt;E. R. Hedrick, [https://archive.org/details/logarithmictrigo00hedriala Logarithmic and Trigonometric Tables] (Macmillan, New York, 1913).&lt;/ref&gt; See [[common logarithm]] for details on the use of characteristics and mantissas.

===History===
{{main|History of logarithms}}
[[Michael Stifel]] published ''Arithmetica integra'' in [[Nuremberg]] in 1544 which contains a table&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Michaele|last=Stifelio|publisher=Iohan Petreium|location=London|year=1544|title=Arithmetica Integra|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fndPsRv08R0C&amp;pg=RA1-PT419}}&lt;/ref&gt; of integers and powers of 2 that has been considered an early version of a logarithmic table.&lt;ref&gt;

The method of logarithms was publicly propounded by [[John Napier]] in 1614, in a book entitled ''Mirifici Logarithmorum Canonis Descriptio'' (''Description of the Wonderful Rule of Logarithms'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Ernest William Hobson|title=John Napier and the invention of logarithms, 1614|year=1914|publisher=The University Press|location=Cambridge|url=https://archive.org/details/johnnapierinvent00hobsiala}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book contained fifty-seven pages of explanatory matter and ninety pages of tables related to [[natural logarithms]]. The  English mathematician [[Henry Briggs (mathematician)|Henry Briggs]] visited Napier in 1615, and proposed a re-scaling of [[Napier's logarithm]]s to form what is now known as the [[common logarithm|common]] or base-10 logarithms. Napier delegated to Briggs the computation of a revised table, and they later published, in 1617, ''Logarithmorum Chilias Prima'' ("The First Thousand Logarithms"), which gave a brief account of logarithms and a table for the first 1000 integers calculated to the 14th decimal place.

The computational advance available via common logarithms, the converse of powered numbers or [[exponential notation]], was such that it made calculations by hand much quicker.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1195">The '''Mathematische Arbeitstagung''' taking place annually in [[Bonn]] since 1957, and founded by [[Friedrich Hirzebruch]], was an international meeting of mathematicians intended to act in clearing-house fashion, by disseminating current research ideas; and, at the same time, to bring mathematics in [[West Germany]] back into its place in European trends. It proved highly successful in attracting the cream of younger mathematicians, partly because its structure was not that of the conventional international conference. The programme of talks was decided 'in real time' only, rather than in advance.

For example, in 1962 the meeting was dominated by talks on [[K-theory]], at that time the breaking news. The early participants included [[Jean-Pierre Serre]], [[Michael Atiyah]] and [[Frank Adams]].

The institutional structure was reinforced from 1969 by the ''Sonderforschungsbereich Theoretische Mathematik'' programme, and from 1980 by the founding of the [[Max Planck Institute for Mathematics]] in Bonn.

{{orphan|date=June 2013}}

In [[mathematics]], an '''''N''-topological space''' is a set equipped with ''N'' arbitrary topologies. If ''τ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''τ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''τ''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; are ''N''&amp;nbsp;topologies defined on a nonempty set '''X''', then the ''N''-topological space is denoted by (''X'',''τ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''τ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''τ''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;).
For ''N''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, the structure is simply a [[topological space]].
For ''N''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, the structure becomes a [[bitopological space]] introduced by J. C. Kelly.&lt;ref name="J. C. Kelly"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kelly|first=J. C.|title=Bitopological spaces|journal=Proc. London Math. Soc.|year=1963|volume=13|issue=3|pages=71–89|doi=10.1112/plms/s3-13.1.71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example ==
Let ''X''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;} be any finite set. Suppose ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;}. Then the collection ''τ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{''φ'',&amp;nbsp;''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''X''} will be a topology on&amp;nbsp;''X''. If ''τ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''τ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''τ''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; be ''m'' such topologies (chain topologies) defined on ''X'', then the structure (''X'', ''τ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''τ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''τ''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;) is an '''''m''-topological space'''.

In [[mathematical folklore]], the '''"no free lunch" (NFL) theorem''' (sometimes pluralized) of [[David Wolpert]] and [[William G. Macready|William Macready]] appears in the 1997 "No Free Lunch Theorems for Optimization".&lt;ref name=WM97&gt;Wolpert, D.H., Macready, W.G. (1997), "[http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/m/profile/dhw/papers/78.pdf No Free Lunch Theorems for Optimization]", ''IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation'' '''1''', 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Wolpert had previously derived no free lunch theorems for [[machine learning]] (statistical inference).&lt;ref name=Wolpert96&gt;Wolpert, David (1996), "[http://www.zabaras.com/Courses/BayesianComputing/Papers/lack_of_a_priori_distinctions_wolpert.pdf The Lack of ''A Priori'' Distinctions between Learning Algorithms]", ''Neural Computation'', pp. 1341-1390.  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220125415/http://www.zabaras.com/Courses/BayesianComputing/Papers/lack_of_a_priori_distinctions_wolpert.pdf |date=2016-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Wolpert and Macready themselves indicated that the first theorem in their paper "state[s] that any two [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] algorithms are equivalent when their performance is averaged across all possible problems".&lt;ref name=WM-coev&gt;Wolpert, D.H., and Macready, W.G. (2005) "Coevolutionary free lunches", ''IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation'', 9(6): 721-735&lt;/ref&gt; The 1997 theorems of Wolpert and Macready are mathematically technical.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The folkloric{{clarify|reason=article doesn't specifically say what the folkloric version is|date=May 2018}} "no free lunch" (NFL) theorem is an easily stated and easily understood consequence of theorems Wolpert and Macready actually prove. It is weaker than the proven theorems, and thus does not encapsulate them. Various investigators have extended the work of Wolpert and Macready substantively. See [[No free lunch in search and optimization]] for treatment of the research area.

While some scholars argue that NFL conveys important insight, others argue that NFL is of little relevance to machine learning research.&lt;ref name=whitley&gt;Whitley, Darrell, and Jean Paul Watson.

==Example==
To find the highest point on Earth, Alice uses a steepest-ascent local search which restarts when a local peak is fully climbed. Bob uses a steepest-descent local search which restarts when it bottoms out at a local trough. In our Earth, Alice will find the highest point much faster than Bob will. However, in some ensembles, each world such as ours can be paired 1-to-1 with a hypothetical "Bobworld" which is identical to ours, except that the elevation of peak of Mount Everest and of the lowest point in the Marianas Trench are swapped, as if a tall pole has been stuck in the Trench. In Bobworld, Bob's strategy of descending outperforms Alice's strategy of climbing; in fact, given further 1-to-1 pairing assumptions that are reasonable in a universe of bounded size, neither Alice's strategy nor Bob's strategy performs better on average, in the absence of some systematic natural bias towards worlds like Earth and away from worlds like Bobworld.&lt;ref name=whitley/&gt;

==Original NFL theorems==
Wolpert and Macready give two NFL theorems that are closely related to the folkloric theorem. In their paper, they state:

{{quote|We have dubbed the associated results NFL theorems because they demonstrate that if an algorithm performs well on a certain class of problems then it necessarily pays for that with degraded performance on the set of all remaining problems.&lt;ref name="WM97" /&gt; }}

The first theorem hypothesizes [[objective function]]s that do not change while optimization is in progress, and the second hypothesizes objective functions that may change.&lt;ref name="WM97" /&gt;

{{block indent|''Theorem 1'': For any algorithms ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, at iteration step ''m''
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\sum_f P(d_m^y | f, m, a_1) = \sum_f P(d_m^y | f, m, a_2),&lt;/math&gt;}}}}

where &lt;math&gt;d_m^y&lt;/math&gt; denotes the ordered set of size &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; of the cost values &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; associated to input values &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f:X \rightarrow Y &lt;/math&gt; is the function being optimized and &lt;math&gt;P(d_m^y | f, m, a)&lt;/math&gt; is the conditional probability of obtaining a given sequence of cost values from algorithm &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; run &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; times on function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.

The theorem can be equivalently formulated as follows:

{{block indent|''Theorem 1'': Given a finite set &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and a finite set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; of real numbers, assume that &lt;math&gt;f : V \to S&lt;/math&gt; is chosen at random according to uniform distribution on the set &lt;math&gt;S^V&lt;/math&gt; of all possible functions from &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. For the problem of optimizing &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; over the set &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, then no algorithm performs better than blind search.}}

Here, ''blind search'' means that at each step of the algorithm, the element &lt;math&gt;v \in V&lt;/math&gt; is chosen at random with uniform probability distribution from the elements of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; that have not been chosen previously.

In essence, this says that when all functions ''f'' are equally likely, the probability of observing an arbitrary sequence of ''m'' values in the course of optimization does not depend upon the algorithm. In the analytic framework of Wolpert and Macready, performance is a function of the sequence of observed values (and not e.g. of wall-clock time), so it follows easily that all algorithms have identically distributed performance when objective functions are drawn uniformly at random, and also that all algorithms have identical mean performance. But identical mean performance of all algorithms does not imply Theorem 1, and thus the folkloric theorem is not equivalent to the original theorem.

Theorem 2 establishes a similar, but "more subtle", NFL result for time-varying objective functions.&lt;ref name=WM97/&gt;

==Motivation==
The NFL theorems were explicitly ''not'' motivated by the question of what can be inferred (in the case of NFL for machine learning) or found (in the case of NFL for search) when the "environment is uniform random". Rather uniform randomness was used as a tool, to compare the number of environments for which algorithm A outperforms algorithm B to the number of environments for which B outperforms A. NFL tells us that (appropriately weighted){{clarify|date=May 2018}} there are just as many environments in both of those sets.

This is true for many definitions of what precisely an "environment" is. In particular, there are just as many prior distributions (appropriately weighted) in which learning algorithm A beats B (on average) as vice versa.{{citation needed|reason=dubious; the set of possible prior distributions is infinite|date=May 2018}} This statement about ''sets of priors'' is what is most important about NFL, not the fact that any two algorithms perform equally for the single, specific prior distribution that assigns equal probability to all environments.

While the NFL is important to understand the fundamental limitation for a set of problems, it does not state anything about each particular instance of a problem that can arise in practice. That is, the NFL states what the NFL states in the mathematical statements and it is nothing more than that. For example, it applies to the situations where the algorithm is fixed first and a nature can choose a worst problem instance to each fixed algorithm. Therefore, if we have a "good" problem in practice or if we can choose a "good" learning algorithm for a given particular problem instance, then the NFL does not mention any limitation about this particular problem instance. See for example.&lt;ref name=KA-deep&gt;Kawaguchi, K., Kaelbling, L.P, and Bengio, Y.(2017) "Generalization in deep learning", https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05468&lt;/ref&gt; To understand the results of the NFL along with "seemingly" contradicting results from other papers, it is important to actually understand the mathematical logic of the NFL instead of intuitive notation of the NFL. All results including the NFL and&lt;ref name="KA-deep"/&gt; are indeed consistent.

==Implications for computing and for the scientific method==
{{Further|Problem of induction}}
To illustrate one of the counter-intuitive implications of NFL, suppose we fix two supervised learning algorithms, C and D. We then sample a target function f to produce a set of input-output pairs, ''d''. How should we choose whether to train C or D on ''d'', in order to make predictions for what output would be associated with a point lying outside of ''d?''

It is common in almost of all science and statistics to answer this question  - to choose between C and D -  by running cross-validation on ''d'' with those two algorithms. In other words, to decide whether to generalize from ''d'' with either C or D'','' we see which of them has better out-of-sample performance when tested within ''d''.

Note that since C and D are fixed, this use of cross-validation to choose between them is itself an algorithm, i.e., a way of generalizing from an arbitrary dataset. Call this algorithm A. (Arguably, A is a simplified model of the scientific method itself.)

Note as well though that we could also use ''anti''-cross-validation to make our choice. In other words, we could choose between C and D based on which has ''worse'' out-of-sample performance within ''d''. Again, since C and D are fixed, this use of anti-cross-validation is itself an algorithm. Call that algorithm B.

NFL tells us (loosely speaking) that B must beat A on just as many target functions (and associated datasets ''d'') as A beats B. In this very specific sense, the scientific method will lose to the "anti" scientific method just as readily as it wins.&lt;ref&gt;Wolpert, D.H. (2013) "What the no free lunch theorems really mean", Ubiquity, Volume 2013, December 2013, DOI: 10.1145/2555235.2555237&lt;/ref&gt;

However, note that NFL only applies if the target function is chosen from a uniform distribution of all possible functions. If this is not the case, and certain target functions are more likely to be chosen than others, then A may perform better than B overall. The contribution of NFL is that it tells us choosing an appropriate algorithm requires making assumptions about the kinds of target functions the algorithm is being used for. With no assumptions, no "meta-algorithm", such as the scientific method, performs better than random choice.

While some scholars argue that NFL conveys important insight, others argue that NFL is of little relevance to machine learning research.&lt;ref name=whitley/&gt;&lt;ref name=carrier/&gt; If [[Occam's razor]] is correct, for example if sequences of lower [[Kolmogorov complexity]] are more probable than sequences of higher complexity, then (as is observed in real life) some algorithms, such as cross-validation, perform better on average on practical problems (when compared with random choice or with anti-cross-validation).&lt;ref&gt;Lattimore, Tor, and Marcus Hutter.

The '''Open Energy Modelling Initiative''' ('''openmod''') is a [[Grassroots|grass roots]] community of [[energy system]] modellers from universities and research institutes across Europe and elsewhere.  The initiative promotes the use of [[open-source software]] and [[open data]] in [[energy system]] [[Energy modeling|modelling]] for research and policy advice.  The Open Energy Modelling Initiative documents a variety of open-source energy models and addresses practical and conceptual issues regarding their development and application.  The initiative runs an [[Electronic mailing list|email list]], an [[internet forum]], and a [[wiki]] and hosts occasional academic workshops.  A statement of aims is available.&lt;ref name="openmod-manifesto"/&gt;

== Context ==

The application of [[open-source software development|open-source development]] to energy modelling dates back to around 2010.  This section provides some background for the growing interest in open methods.

=== Growth in open energy modelling ===

Just two active open energy modelling projects were cited in a 2011 paper: OSeMOSYS and TEMOA.&lt;ref name="howells-etal-2011"/&gt;{{rp|5861}}  Balmorel was also open at that time, having been made public in 2001.{{efn|
NEMO was also under development in 2011 but it is unclear whether its codebase was public at that point.
}}
{{as of|November 2016}}, the openmod wiki lists 24 such undertakings.&lt;ref name="openmod-models-page"/&gt;

=== Academic literature ===

An innovative 2012 paper presents the case for using "open, publicly accessible software and data as well as [[crowdsourcing]] techniques to develop robust energy analysis tools".&lt;ref name="bazilian-etal-2012"/&gt;{{rp|149}}  The paper claims that these techniques can produce high-quality results and are particularly relevant for developing countries.

There is an increasing call for the energy models and [[dataset]]s used for [[energy policy]] analysis and advice to be made public in the interests of transparency and quality.&lt;ref name="acatech-etal-2016"/&gt;  A 2010 paper concerning energy efficiency modeling argues that "an open peer review process can greatly support model verification and validation, which are essential for model development".&lt;ref name="mundaca-etal-2010a"/&gt;{{rp|17}}&lt;ref name="mundaca-etal-2010b"/&gt;  One 2012 study argues that the [[source code]] and datasets used in such models should be placed under publicly accessible [[version control]] to enable third-parties to run and check specific models.&lt;ref name="DeCarolisEtal2012"/&gt;  Another 2014 study argues that the public trust needed to underpin a rapid transition in energy systems can only be built through the use of transparent open-source energy models.&lt;ref name="wiese-etal-2014"/&gt;  The UK TIMES project (UKTM) is open source, according to a 2014 presentation, because "energy modelling must be replicable and verifiable to be considered part of the scientific process" and because this fits with the "drive towards clarity and quality assurance in the provision of policy insights".&lt;ref name="strachan-etal-2014"/&gt;{{rp|8}}  In 2016, the [[Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project]] (DDPP) is seeking to improve its modelling methodologies, a key motivation being "the intertwined goals of transparency, communicability and policy credibility."&lt;ref name="pye-and-bataille-2016"/&gt;{{rp|S27}}  A 2016 paper argues that model-based energy scenario studies, wishing to influence decision-makers in government and industry, must become more comprehensible and more transparent.  To these ends, the paper provides a checklist of transparency criteria that should be completed by modelers.  The authors note however that they "consider open source approaches to be an extreme case of transparency that does not automatically facilitate the comprehensibility of studies for policy advice."&lt;ref name="cao-etal-2016"/&gt;{{rp|4}}  An editorial from 2016 opines that closed energy models providing public policy support "are inconsistent with the open access movement [and] {{sic|public|ally|expected=publicly}} funded research".&lt;ref name="strachan-etal-2016"/&gt;{{rp|2}}  A 2017 paper lists the benefits of open data and models and the reasons that many projects nonetheless remain closed.  The paper makes a number of recommendations for projects wishing to transition to a more open approach.  The authors also conclude that, in terms of openness, energy research has lagged behind other fields, most notably physics, biotechnology, and medicine.&lt;ref name="pfenninger-etal-2017"/&gt;  Moreover:

{{quote|Given the importance of rapid global coordinated action on climate mitigation and the clear benefits of shared research efforts and transparently reproducible policy analysis, openness in energy research should not be for the sake of having some code or data available on a website, but as an initial step towards fundamentally better ways to both conduct our research and engage decision-makers with [our] models and the assumptions embedded within them.&lt;ref name="pfenninger-etal-2017"/&gt;{{rp|214}}}}

A one-page opinion piece in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature News]]'' from 2017 advances the case for using open energy data and modeling to build public trust in policy analysis.  The article also argues that [[academic journal|scientific journals]] have a responsibility to require that data and code be submitted alongside text for scrutiny, currently only ''[[Energy Economics (journal)|Energy Economics]]'' makes this practice mandatory within the energy domain.&lt;ref name="pfenninger-2017"/&gt;

=== Copyright and open energy data ===

Issues surrounding [[copyright]] remain at the forefront with regard to open energy data.  Most energy datasets are collated and published by official or semi-official sources, for example, [[Official statistics|national statistics offices]], [[transmission system operator]]s, and [[Electricity market|electricity market operators]].  The doctrine of open data requires that these datasets be available under [[Copyright#Free licenses|free licenses]] (such as [[Creative Commons license|{{nowrap|CC BY 4.0}}]]) or be in the [[public domain]].  But most published energy datasets carry proprietary licenses, limiting their reuse in numerical and statistical models, open or otherwise.  Measures to enforce [[Transparency (market)|market transparency]] have not helped because the associated information is normally licensed to preclude downstream usage.  Recent transparency measures include the 2013 European energy market transparency regulation 543/2013{{nnbsp}}&lt;ref name="ec-regulation-543-2013"/&gt; and a 2016 amendment to the German Energy Industry Act{{nnbsp}}&lt;ref name="enwg-111d-2016"/&gt; to establish a nation energy information platform, slated to launch on 1{{nbsp}}July 2017.  Energy databases are protected under general [[Sui generis database right|database law]], irrespective of the copyright status of the information they hold.&lt;ref name="boecker-2016"/&gt;

In December 2017, participants from the Open Energy Modelling Initiative and allied research communities made a written submission to the [[European Commission]] on the {{nowrap|re-use}} of [[public sector information]].&lt;ref name="morrison-etal-2017"/&gt;  The document provides a comprehensive account of the data issues faced by researchers engaged in open energy system modeling and energy market analysis and quoted extensively from a German legal opinion.&lt;ref name="jaeger-2017"/&gt;

=== Public policy support ===

In May 2016 the [[European Union]] announced that "all scientific articles in Europe must be freely accessible as of 2020".&lt;ref name="hendrikx-2016"/&gt;  This is a step in the right direction, but the new policy makes no mention of open software and its importance to the scientific process.&lt;ref name="albers-2016"/&gt;  In August 2016, the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] announced a new federal [[source code]] policy which mandates that at least 20% of custom source code developed by or for any agency of the federal government be released as [[open-source software]] (OSS).&lt;ref name="scott-and-rung-2016"/&gt;  The [[United States Department of Energy|US Department of Energy]] (DOE) is participating in the program.  The project is hosted on a dedicated website and subject to a three-year pilot.&lt;ref name="scott-and-rung-2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="code-gov-website"/&gt;  Open-source campaigners are using the initiative to advocate that European governments adopt similar practices.&lt;ref name="new-2016"/&gt;  In 2017 the [[Free Software Foundation Europe]] (FSFE) issued a [[position paper]] calling for free software and open standards to be central to European science funding, including the flagship [[European Union|EU]] program [[Horizon 2020|Horizon{{nbsp}}2020]].  The position paper focuses on open data and open data processing and the question of open modeling is not traversed per{{nbsp}}se.&lt;ref name="gkotsopoulou-etal-2017"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7622">In [[mathematic]]s an '''operand''' is the object of a [[mathematical operation]], i.e. it is the object or quantity that is operated on.&lt;ref&gt;American Heritage Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example ==
The following [[arithmetic]] expression shows an example of operators and operands:

:&lt;math&gt;3 + 6 = 9&lt;/math&gt;

In the above example, '+' is the symbol for the operation called [[addition]]. 

The '''operand''' '3' is one of the inputs (quantities) followed by the addition [[Operator_(mathematics)|operator]], and the operand '6' is the other input necessary for the operation.

The result of the operation is 9. (The number '9' is also called the sum of the augend 3 and the addend 6.)

An operand, then, is also referred to as "one of the inputs (quantities) for an operation".

==Notation==

===Expressions as operands===
Operands may be complex, and may consist of expressions also made up of operators with operands.

:&lt;math&gt;(3 + 5) \times 2&lt;/math&gt;

In the above expression '(3&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;5)' is the first operand for the multiplication operator and '2' the second. The operand '(3&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;5)' is an expression in itself, which contains an addition operator, with the operands '3' and '5'.

===Order of operations===
{{See also|Order of operations}}
Rules of precedence affect which values form operands for which operators:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://publish.aps.org/files/styleguide-pr.pdf |title=Physical Review Style and Notation Guide |publisher=[[American Physical Society]]|accessdate=5 August 2012|at=Section IV&amp;ndash;E&amp;ndash;2&amp;ndash;e}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;3 + 5 \times 2&lt;/math&gt;

In the above expression, the multiplication operator has the higher precedence than the addition operator, so the multiplication operator has operands of '5' and '2'. The addition operator has operands of '3' and '5&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;2'.

===Positioning of operands===
Depending on the [[mathematical notation]] being used the position of an operator in relation to its operand(s) may vary. In everyday usage [[infix notation]] is the most common,&lt;ref name="Infix, Postfix and Prefix"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~pjj/cs212/fix.html | title=The Implementation and Power of Programming Languages | accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; however other notations also exist, such as the [[prefix notation|prefix]] and [[postfix notation|postfix]] notations. These alternate notations are most common within [[computer science]].

Below is a comparison of three different notations — all represent an addition of the numbers '1' and '2'

:&lt;math&gt;1 + 2&lt;/math&gt; (infix notation)

:&lt;math&gt;+\;1\;2&lt;/math&gt; (prefix notation)

:&lt;math&gt;1\;2\;+&lt;/math&gt; (postfix notation)

===Infix notation and the order of operation===
{{main|Order of operations}}

In a mathematical expression, the order of operation is carried out from left to right. Start with the left most value and seek the first operation to be carried out in accordance with the order specified above (i.e., start with parentheses and end with the addition/subtraction group). For example, in the expression

:&lt;math&gt;4 \times 2^2 - (2 + 2^2)&lt;/math&gt;,

the first operation to be acted upon is any and all expressions found inside a parenthesis. So beginning at the left and moving to the right, find the first (and in this case, the only) parenthesis, that is, (2&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Within the parenthesis itself is found the expression 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The reader is required to find the value of 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; before going any further. The value of 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is 4. Having found this value, the remaining expression looks like this:

:&lt;math&gt;4 \times 2^2 - (2 + 4)&lt;/math&gt;

The next step is to calculate the value of expression inside the parenthesis itself, that is, (2&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;4)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;6. Our expression now looks like this:

:&lt;math&gt;4 \times 2^2 - 6&lt;/math&gt;

Having calculated the parenthetical part of the expression, we start over again beginning with the left most value and move right. The next order of operation (according to the rules) is exponents. Start at the left most value, that is, 4, and scan your eyes to the right and search for the first exponent you come across. The first (and only) expression we come across that is expressed with an exponent is 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  We find the value of 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which is 4. What we have left is the expression

:&lt;math&gt;4 \times 4 - 6&lt;/math&gt;.

The next order of operation is multiplication. 4&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;4 is 16. Now our expression looks like this:

:&lt;math&gt;16 - 6&lt;/math&gt;

The next order of operation according to the rules is division. However, there is no division operator sign (÷) in the expression, 16&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;6. So we move on to the next order of operation, i.e., addition and subtraction, which have the same precedence and are done left to right.

:&lt;math&gt;16 - 6 = 10&lt;/math&gt;. 

So the correct value for our original expression, 4&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;(2&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), is 10. 

It is important to carry out the order of operation in accordance with rules set by convention. If the reader evaluates an expression but does not follow the correct order of operation, the reader will come forth with a different value. The different value will be the incorrect value because the order of operation was not followed. The reader will arrive at the correct value for the expression if and only if each operation is carried out in the proper order.

===Arity===
The number of operands of an operator is called its [[arity]].&lt;ref name="Hazewinkel2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Michiel Hazewinkel]]|title=Encyclopaedia of Mathematics, Supplement III|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=47YC2h295JUC&amp;pg=PA3|year=2001|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-0198-7|page=3}}: "Each connective has associated with it a natural number, called its ''rank'', or ''arity''."&lt;/ref&gt; Based on arity, operators are classified as nullary (no operands), [[unary operation|unary]] (1 operand), [[binary operation|binary]] (2 operands), [[ternary operation|ternary]] (3 operands) etc.

==Computer science==
In computer [[programming language]]s, the definitions of [[operator (programming)|operator]] and '''operand''' are almost the same as in mathematics.

In computing, an '''operand''' is the part of a computer instruction which specifies what data is to be manipulated or operated on, while at the same time representing the data itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  |author =Nell Dale and John Lewis
  |title = Computer Science Illuminated, 5th Edition
  |year = 2012
  |publisher = Jones and Bartlett
  |ISBN =978-1449672843
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A computer instruction describes an operation such as add or multiply X, while the operand (or operands, as there can be more than one) specify on which X to operate as well as the value of X.

Additionally, in [[assembly language]], an '''operand''' is a value (an argument) on which the [[instruction (computer science)|instruction]], named by [[mnemonic]], operates.  The operand may be a [[processor register]], a [[memory address]], a literal constant, or a label.  A simple example (in the [[x86]] architecture) is
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="asm"&gt;
MOV DS, AX
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
where the value in register operand &lt;code&gt;AX&lt;/code&gt; is to be moved (&lt;code&gt;[[MOV (x86 instruction)|MOV]]&lt;/code&gt;) into register &lt;code&gt;DS&lt;/code&gt;. Depending on the [[instruction set|instruction]], there may be zero, one, two, or more operands.

A '''porism''' is a mathematical [[proposition]] or [[corollary]].  In particular, the term '''porism''' has been used to refer to a direct result of a proof, analogous to how a corollary refers to a direct result of a [[theorem]].
In modern usage, a '''porism''' is a relation that holds for an infinite range of values but only if a certain condition is assumed, for example [[Steiner chain|Steiner's porism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=College geometry|first=Howard W.|last=Eves|publisher=|year=1995|isbn=0867204753|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The term originates from three books of Euclid with porism, that have been lost.
Note that a proposition may not have been proven, so a porism may not be a theorem, or for that matter, it may not be true.

==History==

===Beginnings===
The treatise which has given rise to this subject is the ''Porisms'' of [[Euclid]], the author of the ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]''. As much as is known of this lost treatise is due to the ''Collection'' of [[Pappus of Alexandria]], who mentions it along with other geometrical treatises, and gives a number of [[lemma (mathematics)|lemma]]s necessary for understanding it.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=102}} Pappus states:
:The porisms of all classes are neither theorems nor problems, but occupy a position intermediate between the two, so that their enunciations can be stated either as theorems or problems, and consequently some geometers think that they are really theorems, and others that they are problems, being guided solely by the form of the enunciation. But it is clear from the definitions that the old geometers understood better the difference between the three classes. The older geometers regarded a theorem as directed to proving what is proposed, a problem as directed to constructing what is proposed, and finally a porism as directed to finding what is proposed (''{{lang|grc|εἰς πορισμὸν αὐτοῦ τοῦ προτεινομένου|}}'').{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=102}}

Pappus goes on to say that this last definition was changed by certain later geometers, who defined a porism on the ground of an accidental characteristic as
"{{lang|grc|τὸ λεῖπον ὑποθέσει τοπικοῦ θεωρήματος}}" (''to leîpon hypothései topikoû theōrḗmatos''), that which falls short of a locus-theorem by a (or in its) hypothesis. Proclus points out that the word ''porism'' was used in two senses. One sense is that of "corollary", as a result unsought, as it were, but seen to follow from a theorem. On the ''porism'' in the other sense he adds nothing to the definition of "the older geometers" except to say that the finding of the center of a circle and the finding of the greatest common measure are porisms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Proclus]], ed. Friedlein, p.&amp;nbsp;301&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=102}}

==Pappus on Euclid's porism==
Pappus gave a complete enunciation of a porism derived from Euclid, and an extension of it to a more general case. This porism, expressed in modern language, asserts the following: Given four straight lines of which three turn about the points in which they meet the fourth, if two of the points of intersection of these lines lie each on a fixed straight line, the remaining point of intersection will also lie on another straight line. The general enunciation applies to any number of straight lines, say ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1, of which ''n'' can turn about as many points fixed on the (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)th.  These ''n'' straight lines cut, two and two, in 1/2''n''(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1) points, 1/2''n''(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1) being a triangular number whose side is ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1. If, then, they are made to turn about the ''n'' fixed points so that any ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 of their 1/2''n''(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1) points of intersection, chosen subject to a certain limitation, lie on ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 given fixed straight lines, then each of the remaining points of intersection, 1/2''n''(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2) in number, describes a straight line. Pappus gives also a complete enunciation of one porism of the first book of Euclid's treatise.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=102}}

This may be expressed thus: If about two fixed points P, Q we make turn two straight lines meeting on a given straight line L, and if one of them cut off a segment AM from a fixed straight line AX, given in position, we can determine another fixed straight line BY, and a point B fixed on it, such that the segment BM' made by the second moving line on this second fixed line measured from B has a given ratio X to the first segment AM. The rest of the enunciations given by Pappus are incomplete, and he merely says that he gives thirty-eight lemmas for the three books of porisms; and these include 171 theorems. The lemmas which Pappus gives in connexion with the porisms are interesting historically, because he gives:
#the fundamental theorem that the cross or an harmonic ratio of a pencil of four straight lines meeting in a point is constant for all transversals;
#the proof of the harmonic properties of a complete quadrilateral;
#the theorem that, if the six vertices of a hexagon lie three and three on two straight lines, the three points of concourse of opposite sides lie on a straight line.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=102}}

From the 17th to the 19th centuries this subject seems to have had great fascination for mathematicians, and many geometers have attempted to restore the lost porisms. Thus [[Albert Girard]] says in his ''Traité de trigonometrie'' (1626) that he hopes to publish a restoration. About the same time [[Pierre de Fermat]] wrote a short work under the title ''Porismatum euclidaeorum renovata doctrina et sub forma isagoges recentioribus geometeis exhibita'' (see ''Œuvres de Fermat'', i., Paris, 1891); but two at least of the five examples of porisms which he gives do not fall within the classes indicated by Pappus.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=103}}

===Later analysis===
[[Robert Simson]] was the first to throw real light upon the subject. He first succeeded in explaining the only three propositions which Pappus indicates with any completeness. This explanation was published in the ''Philosophical Transactions'' in 1723. Later he investigated the subject of porisms generally in a work entitled ''De porismatibus traclatus; quo doctrinam porisrnatum satis explicatam, et in posterum ab oblivion tutam fore sperat auctor'', and published after his death in a volume, ''Roberti Simson opera quaedam reliqua'' (Glasgow, 1776).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=103}}

Simson's treatise, ''De porismatibus'', begins with definitions of theorem, problem, datum, porism and locus. Respecting the porism Simson says that Pappus's definition is too general, and therefore he will substitute for it the following:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Porisma est propositio in qua proponitur demonstrare rem aliquam, vel plures datas esse, cui, vel quibus, ut et cuilibet ex rebus innumeris, non quidem datis, sed quae ad ea quae data sunt eandem habent rationem, convenire ostendendum est affectionem quandam communem in propositione descriptam. Porisma etiam in forma problematis enuntiari potest, si nimirum ex quibus data demonstranda sunt, invenienda proponantur."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
A locus (says Simson) is a species of porism. Then follows a Latin translation of Pappus's note on the porisms, and the propositions which form the bulk of the treatise. These are Pappus's thirty-eight lemmas relating to the porisms, ten cases of the proposition concerning four straight lines, twenty-nine porisms, two problems in illustration and some preliminary lemmas.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=103}}

[[John Playfair]]'s memoir (''Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin.'', 1794, vol. iii.), a sort of sequel to Simson's treatise, had for its special object the inquiry into the probable origin of porisms, that is, into the steps which led the ancient geometers to the discovery of them. Playfair remarked that the careful investigation of all possible particular cases of a proposition would show that (1) under certain conditions a problem becomes impossible; (2) under certain other conditions, indeterminate or capable of an infinite number of solutions. These cases could be enunciated separately, were in a manner intermediate between theorems and problems, and were called "porisms." Playfair accordingly defined a porism thus: "A proposition affirming the possibility of finding such conditions as will render a certain problem indeterminate or capable of innumerable solutions."{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=103}}

Though this definition of a porism appears to be most favoured in England, Simson's view has been most generally accepted abroad, and had the support of [[Michel Chasles]]. However, in [[Joseph Liouville|Liouville]]'s ''Journal de mathematiques pures et appliquées'' (vol. xx., July, 1855), [[P. Breton]] published ''Recherches nouvelles sur les porismes d'Euclide'', in which he gave a new translation of the text of Pappus, and sought to base thereon a view of the nature of a porism more closely conforming to the definitions in Pappus. This was followed in the same journal and in ''La Science'' by a controversy between Breton and [[A. J. H. Vincent]], who disputed the interpretation given by the former of the text of Pappus, and declared himself in favour of the idea of Schooten, put forward in his ''Mathematicae exercitationes'' (1657), in which he gives the name of "porism" to one section. According to [[Frans van Schooten]], if the various relations between straight lines in a figure are written down in the form of equations or proportions, then the combination of these equations in all possible ways, and of new equations thus derived from them leads to the discovery of innumerable new properties of the figure, and here we have "porisms."{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=103}}

The discussions, however, between Breton and Vincent, in which [[C. Housel]] also joined, did not carry forward the work of restoring Euclid's Porisms, which was left for Chasles. His work (''Les Trois livres de porismes d'Euclide'', Paris, 1860) makes full use of all the material found in Pappus. But we may doubt its being a successful reproduction of Euclid's actual work. Thus, in view of the ancillary relation in which Pappus's lemmas generally stand to the works to which they refer, it seems incredible that the first seven out of thirty-eight lemmas should be really equivalent (as Chasles makes them) to Euclid's first seven Porisms. Again, Chasles seems to have been wrong in making the ten cases of the four-line Porism begin the book, instead of the intercept-Porism fully enunciated by Pappus, to which the "lemma to the first Porism" relates intelligibly, being a particular case of it.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=103}}

An interesting hypothesis as to the Porisms was put forward by [[Hyeronimus Georg Zeuthen|H. G. Zeuthen]] (''Die Lehre von den Kegelschnitten im Altertum'', 1886, ch. viii.). Observing, e.g., that the intercept-Porism is still true if the two fixed points are points on a conic, and the straight lines drawn through them intersect on the conic instead of on a fixed straight line, Zeuthen conjectures that the Porisms were a by-product of a fully developed projective geometry of conics. It is a fact that Lemma 31 (though it makes no mention of a conic) corresponds exactly to [[Apollonius of Perga|Apollonius]]'s method of determining the foci of a central conic (Conics, iii. 4547 with 42). The three porisms stated by [[Diophantus]] in his ''Arithmetica'' are propositions in the theory of numbers which can all be enunciated in the form "we can find numbers satisfying such and such conditions"; they are sufficiently analogous therefore to the geometrical porism as defined in Pappus and [[Proclus]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=103}}

How can it be that mathematics, being after all a product of human thought which is independent of experience, is so admirably appropriate to the objects of reality?" —[[Albert Einstein]], in ''Geometry and Experience'' (1921).&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Einstein]], [http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Extras/Einstein_geometry.html Geometry and Experience].&lt;/ref&gt;
*Clearly delineate mathematics and physics: For some results or discoveries, it is difficult to say to which area they belong: to the mathematics or to physics.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Bergé, [https://books.google.com/books?id=umFTtQAACAAJ&amp;dq=%22Des+rythmes+au+chaos%22&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=65aEU7LAKeHL8AHc74HwBg&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA Des rythmes au chaos].&lt;/ref&gt;
*What is the geometry of physical space?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gary Carl Hatfield|title=The Natural and the Normative: Theories of Spatial Perception from Kant to Helmholtz|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JikeeDbYeUQC&amp;pg=PA223|year=1990|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-08086-6|page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*What is the origin of the axioms of mathematics?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gila Hanna|author2=Hans Niels Jahnke|author3=Helmut Pulte|title=Explanation and Proof in Mathematics: Philosophical and Educational Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3bLHye8kSAwC&amp;pg=PA29|date=4 December 2009|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4419-0576-5|pages=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*How does the already existing mathematics influence in the creation and development of [[Theoretical physics#Overview|physical theories]]?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fqxi.org/community/essay/rules |title=FQXi Community Trick or Truth: the Mysterious Connection Between Physics and Mathematics |access-date=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Is arithmetic ''a priori'' or synthetic? (from [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], see [[Analytic–synthetic distinction]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Van Cleve Professor of Philosophy Brown University|title=Problems from Kant|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6WHAgt-Mg1AC&amp;pg=PA22|date=16 July 1999|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=978-0-19-534701-2|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*What is essentially different between doing a physical experiment to see the result and making a mathematical calculation to see the result? (from the [[Alan Turing|Turing]]–[[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] debate)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ludwig Wittgenstein|author2=R. G.

*Do [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] imply that physical theories will always be incomplete? (from [[Stephen Hawking]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Pavel|last=Pudlák|title=Logical Foundations of Mathematics and Computational Complexity: A Gentle Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=obxDAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA659|year=2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-319-00119-7|page=659}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hawking.org.uk/godel-and-the-end-of-physics.html Stephen Hawking. "Godel and the End of the Universe"]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Is math invented or discovered? (millennium-old question, raised among others by [[Mario Livio]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Mario Livio | authorlink = Mario Livio| doi =  | title = Why math works? | journal = Scientific American | volume =  | pages = 80–83 | year = August 2011 | url = http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-math-works/| pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
In recent times the two disciplines have most often been taught separately, despite all the interrelations between physics and mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;Karam; Pospiech; &amp; Pietrocola (2010). "[http://www.univ-reims.fr/site/evenement/girep-icpe-mptl-2010-reims-international-conference/gallery_files/site/1/90/4401/22908/29476/30505.pdf Mathematics in physics lessons: developing structural skills]"&lt;/ref&gt; This led some professional mathematicians who were also interested in [[mathematics education]], such as [[Felix Klein]], [[Richard Courant]], [[Vladimir Arnold]] and [[Morris Kline]], to strongly advocate teaching mathematics in a way more closely related to the physical sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Stakhov "[http://www2.fisica.unlp.edu.ar/materias/algebralineal/documentos/mathharm.pdf Dirac’s Principle of Mathematical Beauty, Mathematics of Harmony]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard Lesh|author2=Peter L.

In [[logic]], the '''scope''' of a [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifier]] or a quantification is the range in the [[Well-formed formula#Predicate logic|formula]] where the quantifier "engages in". It is put right after the quantifier, often in parentheses. Some authors describe this as including the variable put right after the forall or exists symbol. In the formula {{math|∀''xP''}}, for example, {{math|''P''}} (or {{math|''xP''}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bell|first1=John L.|authorlink1=John Lane Bell|last2=Machover|first2=Moshé|authorlink2=Moshé Machover|title=A Course in Mathematical Logic|date=April 15, 2007|publisher=Elsevier Science Ltd|isbn=978-0-7204-2844-5|page=17|chapter=Chapter 1. Beginning mathematical logic}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the scope of the quantifier {{math|∀''x''}} (or {{math|∀}}).

A variable in the formula is [[free variable|free]], if and only if it does not occur in the scope of any quantifier for that variable. A [[term (logic)|term]] is free for a variable in the formula (i.e. free to substitute that variable that occurs free), if and only if that variable does not occur free in the scope of any quantifier for any variable in the term.

[[Image:KsiegaSzkocka1.JPG|thumb|Part of the Scottish Book with [[Stefan Banach|Banach's]] and [[Stanislaw Ulam|Ulam's]] notes.]]
The '''Scottish Café''' ({{lang-pl|Kawiarnia Szkocka}}) was the café in [[Lviv|Lwów]], [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] (now Lviv, [[Ukraine]]) where, in the 1930s and 1940s, &lt;!-- [[Poland|Polish]] --&gt; [[Lwów School of Mathematics|mathematicians from the Lwów School]] collaboratively discussed [[mathematical problem|research problem]]s, particularly in [[functional analysis]] and [[general topology|topology]].

[[Stanislaw Ulam]] recounts that the tables of the café had [[marble]] tops, so they could write in pencil, directly on the table, during their discussions. To keep the results from being lost, and after becoming annoyed with their writing directly on the table tops, [[Stefan Banach]]'s wife provided the mathematicians with a large notebook, which was used for writing the problems and answers and eventually became known as the ''[[Scottish Book]]''. The book—a collection of solved, unsolved, and even probably unsolvable problems—could be borrowed by any of the guests of the café. Solving any of the problems was rewarded with prizes, with the most difficult and challenging problems having expensive prizes (during the [[Great Depression]] and on the eve of [[World War II]]), such as a bottle of fine brandy.&lt;ref&gt;Mauldin, ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

For problem 153, which was later recognized as being closely related to Stefan Banach's "[[approximation problem|basis problem]]", [[Stanisław Mazur]] offered the prize of a live goose. This problem was solved only in 1972 by [[Per Enflo]], who was presented with the live goose in a ceremony that was broadcast throughout Poland.&lt;ref&gt;Mauldin, ed.; Kaluza.&lt;/ref&gt;

The café building now houses the Szkotcka Restaurant &amp; Bar (named for the original Scottish Café) and the Atlas Deluxe hotel at the street address of 27 [[Taras Shevchenko]] Prospekt.

The '''tomahawk''' is a tool in [[geometry]] for [[angle trisection]], the problem of splitting an [[angle]] into three equal parts. The boundaries of its shape include a [[semicircle]] and two [[line segment]]s, arranged in a way that resembles a [[Tomahawk (axe)|tomahawk]], a Native American axe.&lt;ref name="yates"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gardner"/&gt; The same tool has also been called the '''shoemaker's knife''',&lt;ref name="dudley"&gt;{{citation|title=The Trisectors|series=MAA Spectrum|first=Underwood|last=Dudley|authorlink=Underwood Dudley|edition=2nd|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1996|isbn=9780883855140|pages=14–16}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but that name is more commonly used in geometry to refer to a different shape, the [[arbelos]] (a curvilinear triangle bounded by three mutually tangent semicircles).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Charming Proofs: A Journey Into Elegant Mathematics|volume=42|series=Dolciani Mathematical Expositions|first1=Claudi|last1=Alsina|first2=Roger B.|last2=Nelsen|publisher=Mathematical Association of America|year=2010|isbn=9780883853481|contribution=9.4 The shoemaker's knife and the salt cellar|pages=147–148}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The basic shape of a tomahawk consists of a semicircle (the "blade" of the tomahawk), with a line segment the length of the radius extending along the same line as the diameter of the semicircle (the tip of which is the "spike" of the tomahawk), and with another line segment of arbitrary length (the "handle" of the tomahawk) perpendicular to the diameter. In order to make it into a physical tool, its handle and spike may be thickened, as long as the line segment along the handle continues to be part of the boundary of the shape.  Unlike a related trisection using a [[Steel square|carpenter's square]], the other side of the thickened handle does not need to be made parallel to this line segment.&lt;ref name="yates"&gt;{{citation

In some sources a full circle rather than a semicircle is used,&lt;ref name="meserve"/&gt; or the tomahawk is also thickened along the diameter of its semicircle,&lt;ref name="isaacs"/&gt;  but these modifications make no difference to the action of the tomahawk as a trisector.

==Trisection==
[[File:Tomahawk2.svg|thumb|right|300px|A tomahawk [[trisecting an angle]]. The handle ''AD'' forms one trisector and the dotted line ''AC'' to the center of the semicircle forms the other.]]
To use the tomahawk to trisect an angle, it is placed with its handle line touching the apex of the angle, with the blade inside the angle, tangent to one of the two rays forming the angle, and with the spike touching the other ray of the angle.

Martin|last=Isaacs|publisher=American Mathematical Society|year=2009|isbn=9780821847947|pages=209–210}}.&lt;/ref&gt; If the angle to be trisected is too sharp relative to the length of the tomahawk's handle, it may not be possible to fit the tomahawk into the angle in this way, but this difficulty may be worked around by repeatedly doubling the angle until it is large enough for the tomahawk to trisect it, and then repeatedly bisecting the trisected angle the same number of times as the original angle was doubled.&lt;ref name="gardner"&gt;{{citation|first=Martin|last=Gardner|authorlink=Martin Gardner|title=Mathematical Carnival: from penny puzzles, card shuffles and tricks of lightning calculators to roller coaster rides into the fourth dimension|pages=262–263|publisher=Knopf|year=1975}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

If the apex of the angle is labeled ''A'', the point of tangency of the blade is ''B'', the center of the semicircle is ''C'', the top of the handle is ''D'', and the spike is ''E'', then triangles ''ACD'' and ''ADE'' are both right triangles with a shared base and equal height, so they are [[congruent triangles]]. Because the sides ''AB'' and ''BC'' of triangle ''ABC'' are respectively a tangent and a radius of the semicircle, they are at right angles to each other and ''ABC'' is also a right triangle; it has the same hypotenuse as ''ACD'' and the same side lengths ''BC''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''CD'', so again it is congruent to the other two triangles, showing that the three angles formed at the apex are equal.&lt;ref name="meserve"&gt;{{citation|title=Fundamental Concepts of Algebra|first=Bruce E.|last=Meserve|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|year=1982|isbn=9780486614700|page=244|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qtuySdnGDtoC&amp;pg=PA244}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isaacs"/&gt;

La Nave and Mazur describe other trisections than the tomahawk, but the same description applies here: a tomahawk placed with its handle on the apex, parameterized by the position of the spike on its ray, gives a family of constructions in which the relative positions of the blade and its ray change as the spike is placed at the correct point.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The inventor of the tomahawk is unknown,&lt;ref name="yates"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Episodes from the Early History of Mathematics|volume=13|series=New Mathematical Library|first=Asger|last=Aaboe|authorlink=Asger Aaboe|publisher=Mathematical Association of America|year=1997|isbn=9780883856130|page=87|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5wGzF0wPFYgC&amp;pg=PA87}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but the earliest references to it come from 19th-century France.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1065">{{unreferenced|date=October 2017}}In [[mathematics]], a '''toy theorem''' is a simplified version ([[special case]]) of a more general [[theorem]]. For instance, by introducing some simplifying assumptions in a theorem, one obtains a toy theorem.

Usually, a toy theorem is used to illustrate the claim of a theorem. It can also be insightful to study proofs of a toy theorem derived from a non-trivial theorem. Toy theorems can also have education value. After presenting a theorem (with, say, a highly non-trivial proof), one can sometimes give some assurance that the theorem really holds, by proving a toy version of the theorem.

For instance, a toy theorem of the [[Brouwer fixed-point theorem]] is obtained by restricting the [[dimension]] to one. In this case, the Brouwer fixed-point theorem follows almost immediately from the [[intermediate value theorem]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7498">In [[Euclidean geometry]], the '''trillium theorem''' – (from {{lang-rus|лемма о трезубце}},&lt;ref name="rkarasev" /&gt;&lt;ref name="approaching-2014-10-29-inscribed-angles" /&gt; literally 'lemma about trident', {{lang-rus|теорема трилистника}},&lt;ref name="9pointcircle" /&gt; literally 'theorem of trillium' or 'theorem of trefoil') is a statement about properties of [[inscribed circle|inscribed]] and [[circumscribed circle]]s and their relations.

== Theorem ==
[[File:Trillium theorem.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|Trillium theorem]]
Let {{mvar|ABC}} be an arbitrary [[triangle]].  Let {{mvar|I}} be its [[incenter]] and let {{mvar|D}} be the point where line {{mvar|BI}} (the [[angle bisector]] of {{math|∠''ABC''}}) crosses the [[Circumscribed circle|circumcircle]] of {{mvar|ABC}}. Then, the theorem states that {{mvar|D}} is [[equidistant]] from {{mvar|A}}, {{mvar|C}}, and {{mvar|I}}.
Equivalently:
*The circle through {{mvar|A}}, {{mvar|C}}, and {{mvar|I}} has its center at {{mvar|D}}. In particular, this implies that the center of this circle lies on the circumcircle.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

See in particular the discussion on p.&amp;nbsp;65 of circles {{mvar|BIC}}, {{mvar|CIA}}, {{mvar|AIB}}, and their centers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.cut-the-knot.org/m/Geometry/OnePropertyOfCircleThroughIncenter.shtml|title=A Property of Circle Through the Incenter|work=Cut-the-Knot|author=[[Alexander Bogomolny|Bogomolny, Alexander]]|accessdate=2016-01-26}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The three triangles {{mvar|AID}}, {{mvar|CID}}, and {{mvar|ACD}} are [[isosceles triangle|isosceles]], with {{mvar|D}} as their apex.
A fourth point, the [[excenter]] of {{mvar|ABC}} relative to {{mvar|B}}, also lies at the same distance from {{mvar|D}}, diametrally opposite from {{mvar|I}}.&lt;ref name="approaching-2014-10-29-inscribed-angles" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.cut-the-knot.org/Curriculum/Geometry/InExCircum.shtml|title=Midpoints of the Lines Joining In- and Excenters|work=[[Cut-the-Knot]]|first=Alexander|last=Bogomolny|accessdate=2016-01-26}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proof ==

By the [[Inscribed angle|inscribed angle theorem]],

: &lt;math&gt;|\angle ABI| = |\angle DCA|, \quad |\angle CBI| = |\angle DAC|. &lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;BI&lt;/math&gt; is angle bisector,

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; |\angle DCA| = |\angle DAC| \\[6pt]
\Rightarrow {} &amp; |AD| = |CD|, \text{ and }  |\angle DIA| = 180^\circ - |\angle AIB| \\[6pt]
= {} &amp; 180^\circ - (180^\circ - |\angle IAB| - |\angle IBA|) \\[6pt]
= {} &amp; |\angle IAB| + |\angle IBA|= |\angle IAC| + |\angle CAD| \\[6pt]
= {} &amp; |\angle IAD| \\[6pt]
\Rightarrow {} &amp; |AD| = |DI|.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Application to triangle reconstruction==
This theorem can be used to reconstruct a triangle starting from the locations only of one vertex, the incenter, and the circumcenter of the triangle.
For, let {{mvar|B}} be the given vertex, {{mvar|I}} be the incenter, and {{mvar|O}} be the circumcenter. This information allows the successive construction of:
*the circumcircle of the given triangle, as the circle with center {{mvar|O}} and radius {{mvar|OB}},
*point {{mvar|D}} as the intersection of the circumcircle with line {{mvar|BI}},
*the circle of the ò theorem, with center {{mvar|D}} and radius {{mvar|DI}}, and
*vertices {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|C}} as the intersection points of the two circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Problems and Solutions in Euclidean Geometry|series=Dover Books on Mathematics|first1=M. N.|last1=Aref|first2=William|last2=Wernick|publisher=Dover Publications, Inc.|year=1968|isbn=9780486477206|at=3.3(i), p.&amp;nbsp;68|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vAcU7jOFhG4C&amp;pg=PA68}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
However, for some triples of points {{mvar|B}}, {{mvar|I}}, and {{mvar|O}}, this construction may fail, either because line {{mvar|IB}} is tangent to the circumcircle or because the two circles do not have two crossing points. It may also produce a triangle for which the given point {{mvar|I}} is an excenter rather than the incenter. In these cases, there can be no triangle having {{mvar|B}} as vertex, {{mvar|I}} as incenter, and {{mvar|O}} as circumcenter.&lt;ref name="yiu"&gt;{{citation

 | url = http://math.fau.edu/Yiu/j16h2yiu.pdf
 | volume = 16
 | year = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other triangle reconstruction problems, such as the reconstruction of a triangle from a vertex, incenter, and center of its [[nine-point circle]], can be solved by reducing the problem to the case of a vertex, incenter, and circumcenter.&lt;ref name="yiu"/&gt;

==Generalization==
Let {{mvar|I}} and {{mvar|J}} be any two of the four points given by the incenter and the three excenters of a triangle {{mvar|ABC}}. Then {{mvar|I}} and {{mvar|J}} are collinear with one of the three triangle vertices. The circle with {{mvar|IJ}} as diameter passes through the other two vertices and is centered on the circumcircle of {{mvar|ABC}}. When one of {{mvar|I}} or {{mvar|J}} is the incenter, this is the trillium theorem, with line {{mvar|IJ}} as the (internal) angle bisector of one of the triangle's angles. However, it is also true when {{mvar|I}} and {{mvar|J}} are both excenters; in this case, line {{mvar|IJ}} is the external angle bisector of one of the triangle's angles.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Machine Proofs in Geometry: Automated Production of Readable Proofs for Geometry Theorems|volume=6|series=Series on applied mathematics|first1=Shang-Ching|last1=Chou|first2=Xiao-Shan|last2=Gao|first3=Jingzhong|last3=Zhang|publisher=World Scientific|year=1994|isbn=9789810215842|at=Examples 6.145 and 6.146, pp.&amp;nbsp;328–329|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rnI7H_7bLacC&amp;pg=PA328}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''{{lang|de|Vorlesungen über Zahlentheorie}}''' (German for ''Lectures on Number Theory'') is the name of several different textbooks of [[number theory]]. The best known was written by [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]] and [[Richard Dedekind]], and published in 1863. Others were written by [[Leopold Kronecker]], [[Edmund Landau]], and [[Helmut Hasse]]. They all cover elementary number theory, Dirichlet's theorem, quadratic fields and forms, and sometimes more advanced topics.

==Dirichlet and Dedekind's book==

Based on Dirichlet's number theory course at the [[University of Göttingen]], the {{lang|de|Vorlesungen}} were edited by Dedekind and published after Lejeune Dirichlet's death. Dedekind added several appendices to the {{lang|de|Vorlesungen}}, in which he collected further results of Lejeune Dirichlet's and also developed his own original mathematical ideas.

===Scope===
The {{lang|de|Vorlesungen}} cover topics in elementary number theory, [[algebraic number theory]] and [[analytic number theory]], including [[modular arithmetic]], quadratic congruences, [[quadratic reciprocity]] and binary [[quadratic form]]s.

===Contents===
The contents of Professor [[John Stillwell]]'s 1999 translation of the {{lang|de|Vorlesungen}} are as follows

:Chapter 1. On the divisibility of numbers
:Chapter 2. On the congruence of numbers
:Chapter 3. On quadratic residues
:Chapter 4. On quadratic forms
:Chapter 5. Determination of the class number of binary quadratic forms
:Supplement I. Some theorems from Gauss's theory of circle division
:Supplement II. On the limiting value of an infinite series
:Supplement III. A geometric theorem
:Supplement IV. Genera of quadratic forms
:Supplement V. Power residues for composite moduli
:Supplement VI. Primes in arithmetic progressions
:Supplement VII. Some theorems from the theory of circle division
:Supplement VIII. On the Pell equation
:Supplement IX. Convergence and continuity of some infinite series

This translation does not include Dedekind's Supplements X and XI in which he begins to develop the theory of [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]].

The German titles of supplements X and XI are:
:Supplement X: Über die Composition der binären quadratische Formen (On the composition of binary quadratic forms)
:Supplement XI: Über die Theorie der ganzen algebraischen Zahlen (On the theory of algebraic integers)

Chapters 1 to 4 cover similar ground to [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss']] {{lang|la|[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]}}, and Dedekind added footnotes which specifically cross-reference the relevant sections of the {{lang|la|Disquisitiones}}. These chapters can be thought of as a summary of existing knowledge, although Dirichlet simplifies Gauss' presentation, and introduces his own proofs in some places.

Chapter 5 contains Dirichlet's derivation of the [[class number (number theory)|class number]] formula for real and imaginary [[quadratic field]]s. Although other mathematicians had conjectured similar formulae, Dirichlet gave the first rigorous proof.

Supplement VI contains Dirichlet's proof that an arithmetic progression of the form ''a''+''nd'' where ''a'' and ''d'' are coprime contains an infinite number of primes.

===Importance===
The {{lang|de|Vorlesungen}} can be seen as a watershed between the classical number theory of [[Pierre de Fermat|Fermat]], [[Carl Gustav Jakob Jacobi|Jacobi]] and [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]], and the modern number theory of Dedekind, [[Bernhard Riemann|Riemann]] and [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]]. Dirichlet does not explicitly recognise the concept of the [[group theory|group]] that is central to [[Abstract algebra|modern algebra]], but many of his proofs show an implicit understanding of group theory.

The {{lang|de|Vorlesungen}} contains two key results in number theory which were first proved by Dirichlet. The first of these is the [[class number (number theory)|class number]] formulae for binary quadratic forms. The second is a proof that arithmetic progressions contains an infinite number of primes (known as [[Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions|Dirichlet's theorem]]); this proof introduces [[Dirichlet L-series]]. These results are important milestones in the development of analytic number theory.

==Kronecker's book==

[[Leopold Kronecker]]'s book was first published in 1901 in 2 parts and reprinted by Springer in 1978. It covers elementary and algebraic number theory, including Dirichlet's theorem.

==Landau's book==

[[Edmund Landau]]'s book ''Vorlesungen über Zahlentheorie'' was first published as a 3-volume set in 1927. The first half of volume 1 was published as 
''Vorlesungen über Zahlentheorie. Aus der elementare Zahlentheorie'' in 1950, with an English translation in 1958 under the title ''Elementary number theory''. In 1969 Chelsea republished the second half of volume 1 together with volumes 2 and 3 as a single volume. 

Volume 1 on elementary and additive number theory includes the topics such as Dirichlet's theorem, Brun's sieve, binary quadratic forms, Goldbach's conjecture, Waring's problem, and the Hardy–Littlewood work on the singular series. Volume 2 covers topics in analytic number theory, such as estimates for the error in the prime number theorem, and topics in geometric number theory such as estimating numbers of lattice points. Volume 3 covers algebraic number theory, including ideal theory, quadratic number fields, and applications to Fermat's last theorem.  Many of the results described by Landau were state of the art at the time but have since been superseded by stronger results.

==Hasse's book==

[[Helmut Hasse]]'s book ''Vorlesungen über Zahlentheorie'' was published in 1950, and is different from and more elementary than his book ''Zahlentheorie''. It covers elementary number theory, Dirichlet's theorem, and quadratic fields.

'''''What Is Mathematics?''''' is a [[mathematics]] book written by [[Richard Courant]] and [[Herbert Robbins]], published in England by [[Oxford University Press]].  It is an introduction to mathematics, intended both for the mathematics student and for the general public.

First published in 1941, it discusses [[number theory]], [[geometry]], [[topology]] and [[calculus]].  
A second edition was published in 1996 with an additional chapter on recent progress in mathematics, written by [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]].

==Authorship==

The book was based on Courant's course material.
Although Robbins assisted in writing a large part of the book, 
he had to fight for authorship.
Nevertheless, Courant alone held the copyright for the book.
This resulted in Robbins receiving a smaller share of the royalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Title==

[[Michael Katehakis]] remembers Robbins' interest in the literature and Tolstoy in particular and he is convinced that the title of the book is most likely  
due to Robbins,  who was inspired by the title of the essay [[what is art|What is Art?]] by [[Leo Tolstoy]]. 
Robbins did the same in the book 
'' Great Expectations : The Theory of Optimal Stopping '' he co-authored with [[Yuan-Shih Chow]] and [[David Siegmund]], 
where one can not miss the connection with the title of the novel ''[[Great Expectations]]'' by [[Charles Dickens]].

According to [[Constance Reid]],&lt;ref name=reid/&gt; Courant finalized the title after a conversation with [[Thomas Mann]].
