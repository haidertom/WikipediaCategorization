      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19835">The World Monuments Watch is a flagship advocacy program of the [[New York City|New York]]-based private [[non-profit organization]] [[World Monuments Fund]] (WMF) and [[American Express]] to call to action and challenge government authorities responsible for important cultural resources to identify sites immediately at risk, and to stimulate public awareness of the tremendous need to [[Historic preservation|preserve]] and create sustainable uses for significant [[cultural heritage|heritage made by man]].&lt;ref name=1998_press_release&gt;{{cite web | title = Palpung named to list of endangered monuments | date=September 1997 | publisher = World Monuments Fund | url = http://www.asianart.com/cers/palpung/palpwmw.html|accessdate=8 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=1998_official&gt;{{cite web | title = 1998 World Monuments Watch | publisher = World Monuments Fund | url = http://www.wmf.org/pdf/Watch_Catalog_1998.pdf|accessdate=8 September 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selection process==
Every two years, the program publishes a select list known as the Watch List of 100 Most Endangered Sites that is in urgent need of preservation funding and protection. The sites are nominated by public authorities, local preservation groups, and qualified individuals.&lt;ref name=1998_official /&gt; An independent panel of international experts then select 100 candidates from these entries to be part of the Watch List, based on the significance of the site's overall significance, the urgency of its situation, the viability of action plans to save it, and the ability of a local constituency to sustainably maintain the site in the future with the means to do so.&lt;ref name=1998_press_release /&gt; WMF and American Express award grants to sites included on the Watch List. In addition, the leverage from the listing spurs government agencies and local donors to allocate funds and take an active role in protecting the cultural landmark.&lt;ref name=1998_official /&gt;

==1998 Watch List==
The 1998 World Monuments Watch List of 100 Most Endangered Sites was launched on September 8, 1997, by WMF President [[Bonnie Burnham]].&lt;ref name=1998_official /&gt;

The World Monuments Watch is a flagship advocacy program of the [[New York City|New York]]-based private [[non-profit organization]] [[World Monuments Fund]] (WMF) that calls international attention to [[cultural heritage]] around the world that is threatened by [[neglect]], [[vandalism]], [[war|conflict]], or [[natural disaster|disaster]].&lt;ref name=press_release&gt;{{cite web | title = WORLD MONUMENTS FUND ANNOUNCES 2010 WORLD MONUMENTS WATCH LIST OF 100 MOST ENDANGERED SITES | author = Holly Evarts | date = 6 October 2009 | publisher = World Monuments Fund | url =

==Selection process==
Every two years, it publishes a select list known as the Watch List of Endangered Sites that are in urgent need of [[Historic preservation|preservation]] funding and protection. The sites are nominated by governments, conservation professionals, site caretakers, [[non-government organization]]s (NGOs), concerned individuals, and others working in the field.&lt;ref name=press_release /&gt; An independent panel of international experts then select 100 candidates from these entries to be part of the Watch List, based on the significance of the sites, the urgency of the threat, and the viability of both advocacy and conservation solutions.&lt;ref name=press_release /&gt; For the succeeding two-year period until a new Watch List is published, these 100 sites can avail grants and funds from the WMF, as well as from other foundations, private donors, and corporations by capitalizing on the publicity and attention gained from the inclusion on the Watch List.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WORLD MONUMENTS FUND ANNOUNCES 2006 WORLD MONUMENTS WATCH LIST OF 100 MOST ENDANGERED SITES |author=Holly Evarts |date=6 October 2009 |publisher=World Monuments Fund |url=http://www.wmf.org/pdf/WMW_2006_release.pdf |accessdate=8 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516051456/http://www.wmf.org/pdf/WMW_2006_release.pdf |archivedate=May 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2010 Watch List==
The 2010 World Monuments Watch List of Endangered Sites was announced on October 6, 2009 by WMF President Bonnie Burnham.&lt;ref name=press_release /&gt; The 2010 Watch List highlights the need to create a balance between heritage concerns and the social, economic, and environmental interests of communities around the world.&lt;ref name=press_release /&gt;
{{quote|The sites on the 2010 Watch list make a dramatic case for the need to bring together a variety of sectors—economic, environmental, heritage preservation, and social—when we are making plans that will affect us all. Greater cooperation among these sectors would benefit humanity today, while ensuring our place as stewards of the Earth for the next generation.|source=Bonnie Burnham, WMF president|launch of 2010 Watch List&lt;ref name=press_release /&gt;}}

'''''A Short History of Progress''''' is a non-fiction book and lecture series by [[Ronald Wright]] about [[societal collapse]]. The lectures were delivered as a series of five speeches, each taking place in different cities across Canada as part of the 2004 [[Massey Lectures]] which were broadcast on the [[CBC Radio]] program, ''[[Ideas (radio show)|Ideas]]''. The book version was published by [[House of Anansi Press]] and released at the same time as the lectures. The book spent more than a year on Canadian best-seller lists, won the Canadian Book Association's Libris Award for Non-Fiction Book of the Year, and was nominated for the [[British Columbia's National Award for Canadian Non-Fiction]]. It has since been reprinted in a hardcover format with illustrations.

Wright, an author of fiction and non-fiction works, uses the fallen civilisations of [[Easter Island]], [[Sumer]], [[Roman Empire|Rome]], and [[Maya civilisation|Maya]], as well as examples from the Stone Age, to see what conditions led to the downfall of those societies. He examines the meaning of [[progress (history)|progress]] and its implications for civilizations—past and present—arguing that the twentieth century was a time of runaway growth in [[World population|human population]], [[Conspicuous consumption|consumption]], and technology that has now placed an [[Sustainability|unsustainable]] burden on all [[biosphere|natural systems]].

In his analysis of the four cases of fallen civilizations, he notes that two (Easter Island and Sumer) failed due to depletion of [[natural resources]]—"their [[Ecology|ecologies]] were unable to regenerate."  The other two failed in their heartlands, "where ecological demand was highest," but left remnant populations that survived. He asks the question: "Why, if civilizations so often destroy themselves, has the overall experiment of civilization done so well."  For the answer, he says, we must look to natural regeneration and [[human migration]] (Wright, 102).  While some [[ancient civilizations]] were depleting their ecologies and failing, others were rising. Large expanses of the planet were unsettled. The other factor, evident in both [[Egypt]] and [[China]], was that due to abundant resources (e.g., topsoil), [[Agriculture|farming]] methods (ones that worked with, rather than against, natural cycles), and settlement patterns, these civilizations had greater longevity (103-104).

Changes brought on by the exponential growth of human [[Population growth|population]] (at the time of the book's publication, over 6 billion and adding more than 200 million people every three years) and the worldwide scale of [[resource consumption]], have altered the picture, however.  Ecological markers indicate that human civilization has now surpassed (since the 1980s) nature's capacity for regeneration.  We are now using more than 125% of nature's yearly output.  "If civilization is to survive, it must live on the [[interest]], not the [[Capital (economics)|capital]] of nature" (129).  He concludes that "now is our chance to get the future right"—the collapse of human civilization is imminent if we do not act now to prevent it (132).

==Background==
Prior to being selected to deliver the Massey Lectures, Wright had written award-winning fiction and non-fiction books that deal with anthropology and civilizations. His 1992 non-fiction book ''Stolen Continents: The "New World" Through Indian Eyes'' was awarded the 1993 Gordon Montador Award from the [[Writers' Trust of Canada]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Stolen Continents wins inaugural award (Gordon Montador Award)|journal= The Canadian Bookseller |date=June–July 1993 |volume= 15 |issue=6 |page= 106}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his 1998 novel ''A Scientific Romance'', about a museum curator who travels into the future and investigates the fate of the human race, won the [[David Higham Prize for Fiction]] for [[Debut novel|first-time novelists]]. Wright traces the origins of the ideas behind ''A Short History of Progress'' to the material he studied while writing ''A Scientific Romance'' and his 2000 essay for ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' titled "Civilization is a Pyramid Scheme" about the fall of the ninth-century Mayan civilisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sandra |last= Martin |title=Our last chance to get the future right |work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada  |date= 6 November 2004 |page=F.6 |url= https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/our-last-chance-to-get-the-future-right/article956497/page1/ |accessdate=17 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The first chapter, "Gauguin's Questions", poses the questions that provide a framework for the book. Referring to [[Paul Gauguin]]'s painting of the [[Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?|same name]] the questions are: ''Where do we come from? What are we? Where are we going?'' Wright defines progress using the Victorian terms "the assumption that a pattern of change exists in the history of mankind...that it consists of irreversible changes in one direction only, and that this direction is towards improvement". Despite the extended time span of the [[Stone Age]], Wright places the first sign of progress as being the ability to create fire. The competition between [[Cro-Magnon]] and [[Neanderthal]]s is examined with respect to the conditions that allowed one to out-compete the other.

{{quote box |width=25em | bgcolor=#c6dbf7 |align=left |halig=left | salign=right |quote= Many of the great ruins that grace the deserts and jungles of the earth are monuments to progress traps, the headstones of civilizations which fell victim to their own success. In the fates of such societies – once mighty, complex, and brilliant – lie the most instructive lessons...they are fallen airliners whose black boxes can tell us what went wrong. |source=&amp;nbsp;—''A Short History of Progress'', p 8}}

The second chapter, "The Great Experiment", continues the examination of Stone Age progress by looking at the advancements in hunting. Wright uses the term "[[progress trap]]" to refer to innovations that create new problems for which the society is unable or unwilling to solve, or inadvertently create conditions that are worse than what existed before the innovation. For example, innovations in hunting during the Stone Age allowed for more successful hunts and consequently more free time during which culture and art were created (e.g. cave paintings, bone carvings, etc.), but also led to extinctions, most notably of [[megafauna]]. As smaller and smaller game were hunted to replace larger extinct animals, the hunts became less successful and culture declined. [[History of agriculture|Agriculture]], and subsequently civilisations, independently arising in multiple regions at about the same time, ~10,000 years ago, indicates to Wright that "given certain broad conditions, human societies everywhere will move towards greater size, complexity and environmental demand". The chapter title refers to the human experience which Wright sees as a large experiment testing what conditions are required for a human civilisation to succeed.

In the third chapter, "Fools' Paradise", the rise and fall of two civilisations are examined: [[Easter Island]] and [[Sumer]]. Both flourished, but collapsed as a result of [[resource depletion]]; both were able to visually see their land being eroded but were unwilling to reform. On Easter Island logging, in order to erect statues and build boats, destroyed their ecosystem and led to wars over the last planks of wood on the island. In Sumer, a large irrigation system, as well as over-grazing, land clearing, and [[Lime kiln|lime-burning]] led to [[desertification]] and [[Soil salinity|soil salination]].

{{quote box |width=25em | bgcolor=#c6dbf7 |align=right |halig=left | salign=right|quote= The lesson I read in the past is this: that the health of land and water – and of woods, which are the keepers of water – can be the only lasting basis for any civilization’s survival and success. |source=&amp;nbsp;—''A Short History of Progress'', p 105}}

In the fourth chapter, "Pyramid Schemes", the fates of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Maya civilisation|Mayan]] civilisations are compared; both peaked with centralised empires but ended with power being diffused to their periphery as the center collapsed and ultra-conservative leadership refused reformations. Anthropologist [[Joseph Tainter]]'s explanation for the fall of the Roman Empire is invoked, that "complex systems inevitably succumb to diminishing returns" so that the costs of operating an empire are so high that alternatives are implemented. Two examples of civilisations that have been sustainable are described: China and Egypt. Both had an abundance of resources, particularly [[topsoil]], and used farming methods that worked with, rather than against, natural cycles, and settlement patterns that did not exceed, or permanently damage, the [[carrying capacity]] of the local environment.

The final chapter, "The Rebellion of the Tools", seeks to answer the final Gauguin question, 'where are we going?', by applying these past examples to modern society. Wright sees needed reforms being blocked by vested interests who reject [[Multilateralism|multi-lateral organisations]], and support [[Laissez-faire|laissez-faire economics]] and transfers of power to corporations as leading to the social and environmental degradations that led to the collapse of previous civilisations. Necessary reforms are, in Wright's view, being blocked by vested interests who are hostile to change, including American market extremists. Wright concludes that "our present behaviour is typical of failed societies at the zenith of their greed and arrogance" and calls for a shift towards long-term thinking:

The great advantage we have, our best chance for avoiding the fate of past societies, is that we know about those past societies. We can see how and why they went wrong. ''Homo sapiens'' has the information to know itself for what it is: an Ice Age hunter only half-evolved towards intelligence; clever but seldom wise.

We are now at the stage when the Easter Islanders could still have halted the senseless cutting and carving, could have gathered the last trees' seeds to plant out of reach of the rats. We have the tools and the means to share resources, clean up pollution, dispense basic health care and birth control, set economic limits in line with natural ones. If we don't do these things now, while we prosper, we will never be able to do them when times get hard. Our fate will twist out of our hands.

==Style==
The contents of the book were originally written and delivered as a set of five speeches for the 2004 [[Massey Lectures]]; each speech is presented in the book as one chapter. The writing reflects Wright oration style with the use of high rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first= Marq |last= de Villiers |title= Voices for change |journal = [[Canadian Geographic]] |volume =125 |issue =3 |pages =127–130 |date= May–June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patrick Parrinder]] notes that Wright sometimes uses "the rhetorical armoury of a rationalistic lay preacher."&lt;ref name=Parrinder&gt;{{cite journal |first= Patrick |last= Parrinder |title= Book Reviews |journal = [[Utopian Studies]] |volume =17 |issue =1 |pages =267–270 |year= 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wright takes a broad, philosophical approach, not focusing on individual people or specific politics or religions, but rather focusing on civilisations including 'the elites and the masses'.&lt;ref name=Parrinder/&gt; Wright's tone was described as "rarely depressing...[and that] he remains surprisingly upbeat and even entertaining."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Christine |last= Sismondo |title=If you read one book on impending doom this year, make it this one |work=The Ottawa Citizen |location= Ottawa, Ontario |date=21 November 2004 |page=C11}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the word ''progress'' is intended to be ironic: what is viewed as technological or social advancement have, in the historical narratives he provides, led to the fall of civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= A Short History of Progress |journal = [[Kirkus Reviews]] |volume =73 |issue =4 |page =224 |date= 15 February 2005 |url= http://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/non-fiction/ronald-wright/a-short-history-of-progress/ |accessdate=17 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wright coins the term "[[progress trap]]" to describe the phenomenon of turning "cleverness into recklessness."&lt;ref name=Bronwyn&gt;{{cite journal |first= Bronwyn |last= Drainie |title= As we go up, we go down |journal = [[Quill &amp; Quire]] |url= http://www.quillandquire.com/reviews/review.cfm?review_id=4249 |volume =70 |issue =12 |page =23 |date=December 2004 |accessdate=17 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparisons have been made between this book and [[Jared Diamond]]'s ''[[Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]]'' which both cover similar subject matter with "a cautious problem-solving approach"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first= Claudia |last= Stoicescu |title= The Doomsayers |journal = [[Corporate Knights]] |volume =70 |issue =12 |pages =43–45 |date=May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and come to similar conclusions. Writing in ''[[A\J: Alternatives Journal|Alternatives Journal]]'', philosophy professor Kent Peacock notes that "both are well-written" but that Diamond includes examples of societies which had achieved [[sustainability]] for centuries, whereas Wright has "a stronger grasp of the dark side of human nature", like impatience, aggressiveness, and obstinacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first= Kent |last= Peacock |title= Progress Traps |journal = [[A\J: Alternatives Journal|Alternatives Journal]] |volume =32 |issue =3 |pages =38–41 |date=July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author and journalist [[Brian Brett]] described Collapse as "a slow, rich feast" while "the compact ''A Short History of Progress'' is an arrow loosed from a powerful bow, a lyric dart into the heart of human behaviour."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Brian |last= Brett |title=Why civilizations implode |work=Vancouver Sun |location=Canada  |date= 1 January 2005 |page=E.15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication and reception==
The book, published by [[House of Anansi Press]], was released at the same time the Massey Lectures were being delivered. In early November 2004, one lecture was given by Wright in each of the following cities: [[Ottawa]], Edmonton, [[Saskatoon]], [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]] and Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Jenni |last= Mortin |title=Get it right this time |work= [[The StarPhoenix]] |location= Saskatoon, Saskatchewan |date=6 November 2004 |page=E8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their recording was broadcast on [[CBC Radio One|CBC Radio's]] ''[[Ideas (radio show)|Ideas]]'' during the week of November 22. The book was named the Canadian Booksellers Association's 2005 Non-Fiction Book of the Year at their annual Libris Awards&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher = Canadian Booksellers Association |date = 26 June 2005 |format = pdf |title =CBA Libris Awards 2005 |url= http://www.cbabook.org/files/Libris-2005-Winners.pdf |accessdate =12 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and short-listed for the first annual British Columbia Award for Canadian Non-Fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=One of these outstanding books will be the first |work= British Columbia Award for Canadian Non-Fiction |publisher= British Columbia Achievement Foundation |year= 2005 |url= http://www.bcachievement.com/nonfiction/media.php?year=2005 |accessdate =14 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A hardcover edition title ''An Illustrated Short History of Progress'' was released with a print run of 15,000 copies in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=An Illustrated Short History of Progress |work= AIGA Design Archives |publisher= American Institute of Graphic Arts |year= 2007 |url= http://designarchives.aiga.org/#/entries/%2Byear%3A%222006%22/_/detail/relevance/asc/197/7/7700/an-illustrated-short-history-of-progress/1 |accessdate =14 November 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101203044320/http://designarchives.aiga.org/| archivedate= 3 December 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', Canadian author [[Paul William Roberts]] praised the book, calling it "... the most important use of printed word and post-consumer recycled fibres I have seen since Jérôme Deshusses's Délivrez Prométhée, 25 years ago." Roberts explains, "[Wright] has such a firm grasp of his goal that scarcely a word is extraneous... You feel you've read volumes, though, not just because of the density of Wright's thoughts, but due to the crushing weight of the burden they carry. In prose that is balefully evocative and irreducibly precise..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Paul |last= Roberts |authorlink= Paul William Roberts |title=Do the Wright thing |work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada  |date= 6 November 2004 |page=D.6 |url= https://www.theglobeandmail.com/archives/do-the-wright-thing/article955077/singlepage/ |accessdate=17 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, in the ''[[National Post]]'' review, Peter Foster gave a negative review, chiding Wright for "not having the slightest clue about how economies work, or how, by their fundamental nature, markets are both moral and sustainable." Foster ended his review by insulting Wright's intellect, "What really needs some psychological excavation is Ronald Wright's mind, which carries a set of inflated, emotionally based moralistic assumptions derived from the structure of his primitive ignorance about markets and economics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Peter |last= Foster |title=CBC Radio's Marxist Masseys |work=National Post |location=Canada  |date= 1 December 2004 |page=FP17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other reviews were encouraging. In ''[[Maclean's]]'' magazine Brian Bethune wrote it was "an elegant and learned discussion" on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first= Brian |last= Bethune |title= Mad, Mad World |journal = [[Maclean's]] |volume =117 |issue =47 |pages =44–46 |date= 22 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review in ''[[The Times]]'' said it was "an eminently readable account...written with an incredible lightness of touch that belies the very serious issues."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cradle of civilisation |work=The Times |location= London |date= 10 June 2006 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[The Gazette (Montreal)|Montreal Gazette]]'', Bryan Demchinsky called Wright eloquent and the book "a brief, trenchant essay."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Bryan |last= Demchinsky |title=Monuments to neglect |work= [[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]] |location= Montreal, Quebec |date= 15 January 2005 |page=I.6}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Diane Barlee in [[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)|''Skeptic'']] magazine, said Wright is a "remarkably gifted wordsmith whose talent makes turgid facts not only digestible, but also generates a hunger for more" and commented "''A Short History of Progress'' is an important, well-crafted book, however, I can't promise that it will change your life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first= Diane |last= Barlee |title= The Progress Trap |journal = [[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)|Skeptic]] |volume =12 |issue =1 |pages =86–87 |year= 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film==
{{main article|Surviving Progress}}
The film rights were sold to [[Cinémaginaire]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Marke |last= Andrews |title=Vancouver film production on the money |work=Vancouver Sun |location=Canada  |date= 10 April 2008 |page=C.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was filmed as a documentary, ''Surviving Progress'' directed by Mathieu Roy and co-directed by Harold Crooks with [[Daniel Louis]] and [[Denise Robert]] as producers for Cinemaginaire and Gerry Flahive as producer for NFB. [[Martin Scorsese]] was attached to the project as executive producer as were Mark Achbar and Betsy Carson (Big Picture Media Corporation) and Silva Basmajian (NFB).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Douglas |last= Todd |title=We're evolving, but are we progressing? |work=Vancouver Sun |location=Canada  |date= 22 May 2010 |page=C.4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film premiered at the 2011 [[Toronto International Film Festival]]. It was also shown as part of Festival Atmospheres on 31 March 2012 in Paris France.

While the book focused on ancient civilizations, the majority of the film addresses environmental impacts of our current 'global civilization', including the impact of concentrating wealth in the hands of the 'financial class'. It is filmed as a mixture of interviews with individuals, from Wright himself to Jane Goodall and Margaret Atwood, interspersed with striking footage from all over the world. Mathieu Roy and Harold Crooks gave an interview in early 2012 on the challenges of adapting Ronald Wright's book into a succinct film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast|format=[http://media.blubrry.com/extraenvironmentalist/p/extraenvironmentalist.com/audio/Ep41_final.mp3 MP3]|title=Episode 41 Surviving Progress |url=http://www.extraenvironmentalist.com/2012/05/27/episode-41-surviving-progress/ |host=The Extraenvironmentalist |date=7 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Ab urbe condita''}}
[[Image:Antoninianus-Pacatianus-1001-RIC 0006cf.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Antoninianus]] of [[Pacatianus]], [[Roman usurper|usurper]] of Roman emperor [[Philip the Arab|Philip]] in 248. It bears the legend ROMAE AETER[NAE] AN[NO] MIL[LESIMO] ET PRIMO, "To eternal Rome, in its one thousand and first year".]]
'''''Ab urbe condita''''' ({{IPA-la|ab ˈʊrbɛ ˈkɔndɪtaː}}), or '''''Anno urbis conditæ''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈannoː ˈʊrbɪs ˈkɔndɪtae̯}}), often abbreviated as AUC in either case, is a convention that was used in antiquity and by [[Classicist|classical historians]] to refer to a given year in [[Ancient Rome]].  ''Ab urbe condita'' literally means "from the [[founding of Rome|founding of the City]]," while ''anno urbis conditæ'' means "in the year since the City's founding."  Therefore, the traditional year of the foundation of Rome, [[753 BC]], would be written AUC 1, while [[AD 1]] would be AUC 754. The foundation of the [[Roman Empire|Empire]] in 27 BC would be AUC 727.

Usage of the term was more common during the [[Renaissance]], when editors sometimes added AUC to Roman manuscripts they published, giving the false impression that the convention was commonly used in antiquity.  In reality, the dominant method of identifying years in Roman times was to name the two [[Roman consul|consul]]s who held office that year. In late antiquity, [[regnal years]] were also in use, as was the [[Diocletian era]] in Roman Egypt after AD 293, and in the [[Byzantine Empire]] after AD 537, following a decree by [[Justinian]].

==Significance==
The traditional date for the founding of Rome, 21 April 753 BC, is due to  [[Marcus Terentius Varro]] ([[1st century BC|First Century BC]]). Varro may have used the consular list (with its mistakes) and called the year of the first consuls "''ab urbe condita'' 245," accepting the 244-year interval from [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] for the kings after the foundation of Rome. The correctness of this calculation has not been confirmed, but it is still used worldwide.

From the time of [[Claudius]] (ruled AD 41 to AD 54) onward, this calculation superseded other contemporary calculations. Celebrating the anniversary of the city became part of imperial [[propaganda]]. Claudius was the first to hold magnificent celebrations in honor of the anniversary of the city, in AD 48, the eight hundredth year from the founding of the city.{{cn|date=June 2016}} [[Hadrian]] and [[Antoninus Pius]] held similar celebrations, in AD 121, and in AD 147 and AD 148, respectively.

In AD 248, [[Philip the Arab]] celebrated Rome's first [[millennium]], together with [[Ludi saeculares]] for Rome's alleged tenth [[saeculum|sæculum]]. [[Coin]]s from his reign commemorate the celebrations. A coin by a contender for the imperial throne, [[Pacatianus]], explicitly states "[y]ear one thousand and first", which is an indication that the citizens of the empire had a sense of the beginning of a new era, a ''Sæculum Novum''.

==Calendar era==
{{see|Calendar era}}
The [[Anno Domini]] (AD) year numbering was developed by a monk named [[Dionysius Exiguus]] in Rome in AD 525, as a result of his work on calculating the date of Easter. 
Dionysius did not use the AUC convention, but instead based his calculations on the 
[[Diocletian era]].
This convention had been in use since AD 293, the year of the [[tetrarchy]], as it became impractical to use regnal years of the current emperor.&lt;ref&gt;
J. David Thomas, "On Dating by Regnal Years of Diocletian, Maximian and the Caesars", 
''Chronique d'Egypte'' 46.91 (1971),  173&amp;ndash;179, [https://doi.org/10.1484/J.CDE.2.308234 doi:10.1484/J.CDE.2.308234].&lt;/ref&gt;
In his Easter table, the year AD 532 was equated with the 248th regnal year of  Diocletian. The table counted the years starting from the presumed birth of Christ, rather than the accession of the emperor [[Diocletian]] on 20 November AD 284, or as stated by Dionysius: "''sed magis elegimus ab incarnatione Domini nostri Jesu Christi annorum tempora praenotare…''" ("but rather we choose to name the times of the years from the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ …").&lt;ref&gt;''Liber de Paschate'', [[Jacques Paul Migne|Migne]], ''[[Patrologia Latina]]'', [https://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC12663742&amp;id=LcEYeL-4ZuEC&amp;pg=PP10&amp;lpg=PP10&amp;dq=%22in+hoc+tomo+LXVII#PRA1-PT165,M1 Volume 67, page 481, note f]&lt;/ref&gt; Blackburn and Holford-Strevens review interpretations of Dionysius which place the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] in 2 BC, 1 BC, or AD 1.&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, B. &amp; Holford-Strevens, L, ''The Oxford Companion to the Year'' (Oxford University Press, 2003 corrected reprinting, originally 1999) 778&amp;ndash;780.&lt;/ref&gt; 

It has later been calculated{{by whom|date=May 2018}} (from the historical record of the succession of [[List of Roman consuls|Roman consuls]]) that the year AD 1 corresponds to AUC 754, based on the epoch of Varro. 
Thus, 
* AUC 1 = 753 BC
* AUC 753 = 1 BC
* AUC 754 = AD 1 
* AUC 1000 = AD 247
* AUC 2753 = AD 2000
* AUC {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+752}} = AD {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}
* AUC {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+753}} = AD {{CURRENTYEAR}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1470">'''Akakor''' is the name of a mythological ancient underground city, located somewhere between [[Brazil]], [[Bolivia]] and [[Peru]].

It was described by German journalist [[Karl Brugger]], based on interviews with a self-proclaimed Brazilian Indian chieftain [[Tatunca Nara]] in his book ''The Chronicle of Akakor'' (1976). Although Brugger was apparently convinced, the information in it has only one source (Tatunca Nara), who was later exposed by activist and adventurer [[Rüdiger Nehberg]] as being Günther Hauck, a German.

Elements of the story from ''The Chronicle of Akakor'' were used in the film
''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'', where they were conflated with [[El Dorado]], although references are to "Akator".&lt;ref&gt;[http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2008/05/10/film-preview-part-one-indiana-jones-kingdom-of-the-crystal-skull/  Film Preview (Pt.

The book has been described as  bigoted and "vicious",&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BuYrAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22American+Freedom+and+Catholic+Power%22&amp;dq=%22American+Freedom+and+Catholic+Power%22&amp;hl=en  Journal of church and state, Volume 1] Baylor University.

McGreevy. WW Norton p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; It was based on a series of articles that he had published in the magazine ''[[The Nation]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Blanshard's autobiography indicates that his precipitating concern in 1946, which propelled him to commence research, was the influence of [[Catholic doctrine]] upon the practice of medicine generally, and [[obstetrics]] specifically. Some reviewers thought that the book incorporated [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] sentiments into its anti-Catholicism, including that the Church was a foreign power in America determined to dominate the world.&lt;ref&gt;Lockwood, Robert P., [https://books.google.com/books?id=QPW4-Ej3rGAC&amp;dq Anti-Catholicism in American Culture], p. 41-43, 2000, Our Sunday Visitor Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cVwthOtTiI4C&amp;pg=PA222&amp;dq=%22American+Freedom+and+Catholic+Power%22&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=%22American%20Freedom%20and%20Catholic%20Power%22&amp;f=false The New Anti-Catholicism: The Last Acceptable Prejudice] By Philip Jenkins&lt;/ref&gt; In the prologue, Blanshard said that he was not opposed to the Catholic religion or to Catholic Americans, but that the church's hierarchy had an undue influence on legislation, education and medical practice.

==Writings in ''The Nation''==
In the late 1940s Blanshard published a series of articles that questioned and criticized specific activities and goals of the Catholic Church in the United States. New York school libraries were pressured to cancel subscriptions to ''[[The Nation]]'' by Cardinal [[Francis Spellman]], an action denounced by [[Eleanor Roosevelt]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DqhuCm8w_TYC&amp;pg=RA2-PA252&amp;dq=eleanor+roosevelt+%22The+Nation%22+blanshard&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=eleanor%20roosevelt%20%22The%20Nation%22%20blanshard&amp;f=false The Kennedys: America's Emerald Kings] By Thomas Maier. Basic Books. p 252.&lt;/ref&gt; The series of articles formed the basis for the book published by [[Beacon Press]] in their book series entitled Series in Freedom and Power.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=73963048 	 American Freedom and Catholic Power]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and criticism==
When the book was released, ''[[The New York Times]]'' refused to accept advertising for the book and many bookstores refused to carry it.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, Philip, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cVwthOtTiI4C&amp;dq The New Anti-Catholicism: The Last Acceptable Prejudice], p. 37, Oxford University Press US, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; However, the book sold 240,000 copies in its first edition.&lt;ref&gt;David T. Courtwright, ''No Right Turn: Conservative Politics in a Liberal America'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 2010, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; It was praised by [[John Dewey]], [[Albert Einstein]], [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Henry Sloane Coffin]], and [[Horace Kallen]] as well as scholarly reviewers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RavxqLxKzN4C&amp;pg=PA166&amp;dq=%22American+Freedom+and+Catholic+Power%22&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=%22American%20Freedom%20and%20Catholic%20Power%22&amp;f=false Catholicism and American freedom: a history] By John T. McGreevy&lt;/ref&gt; A work of rebuttal, ''Catholicism and American Freedom'' was written by James M. O'Neill and published in 1952. Blanshard's rejoinder to O'Neill and others was the pamphlet ''My Catholic Critics''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0313246203 Review at Amazon.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Blanshard published a second edition that updated the book.  Blanshard was later a vocal admirer of John F. Kennedy.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

[[William A. Donohue]] of the [[Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights]] calls it a "hate-filled" book that raised the "old canard of 'dual loyalties'" and included such "rubbish" as Blanshard's "Catholic Plan for America", which purportedly entailed "seizing the government, repealing the First Amendment, outlawing divorce, and making the pope the president's official superior".&lt;ref&gt;Donohue, William A., [https://books.google.com/books?id=-MZKTO3Rl7cC&amp;pg=PT81 Secular Sabotage: How Liberals Are Destroying Religion and Culture in America], p. 81-82, Hachette Digital, Inc., 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philip Jenkins]], the Protestant author of ''[[The New Anti-Catholicism: The Last Acceptable Prejudice]]'', notes that the book contains echoes of the views of the [[American Protective Association]] and the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and, although Blanshard's plan of "resistance" to Catholicism did not prescribe the violence of those earlier anti-Catholic predecessors, that in the shadow of [[World War II]] readers would read the word resistance to have such an implication.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, Philip,  [https://books.google.com/books?id=cVwthOtTiI4C&amp;dq The New Anti-Catholicism: The Last Acceptable Prejudice], p. 37-38, Oxford University Press US, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Catholic author Robert Lockwood states the work essentially makes a secularist argument, despite having its foundation in English anti-Catholicism of a Protestant variety.&lt;ref&gt;Lockwood, Robert P., [https://books.google.com/books?id=QPW4-Ej3rGAC&amp;dq Anti-Catholicism in American Culture], p. 42, 2000, Our Sunday Visitor Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second Edition, March 1958==
In the Preface to the Revised Edition, Blanshard wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"It is almost ten years since American Freedom and Catholic Power was published as a book, and somewhat more than a decade since major portions of this work appeared in magazine form. I express my appreciation to those American and foreign readers (several millions) who made possible the miraculous passage of this book through the vicissitudes of twenty-six printings in this country and abroad.
– No book in recent years has drawn a heavier barrage from ecclesiastical batteries. The work is often called "controversial" – and I "the dean of American controversy". I do not care to repudiate the title, since I regard controversy in a good cause as entirely honorable. – It is my purpose here to bring all factual statements up to date, to cover the most dramatic and significant events in the battle of Catholic power during the past decade, and to add to the narrative more abundant documentation so that every controversial assertion may be supported by the latest items of evidence from Catholic sources.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On page 350 of the Second Edition, Blanshard included three issues that he said any Catholic candidate for the U.S. Presidency must address: "the Catholic boycott of public schools, the drive of Catholic bishops for public funds, and the appointment of a Vatican ambassador."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Carty |first=Thomas J. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oNoU_IIGHBkC&amp;pg=PA71 |page=71 |title=A Catholic in the White House?: Religion, Politics, and John F.

An '''anachronism''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀνά}} {{lang|grc-Latn|ana}}, "against" and {{lang|grc|χρόνος}} {{lang|grc-Latn|khronos}}, "time") is a [[chronology|chronological]] inconsistency in some arrangement, especially a juxtaposition of persons, events, objects, or customs from different periods of time. The most common type of anachronism is an object misplaced in time, but it may be a verbal expression, a technology, a philosophical idea, a musical style, a material, a plant or animal, a custom, or anything else associated with a particular period in time that is placed outside its proper temporal domain.

An anachronism may be either intentional or unintentional. Intentional anachronisms may be introduced into a literary or artistic work to help a contemporary audience engage more readily with a historical period. Anachronism can also be used for purposes of rhetoric, comedy, or shock. Unintentional anachronisms may occur when a writer, artist, or performer is unaware of differences in technology, language, customs, attitudes, or fashions between different historical eras.

==Types== 
[[Image:Aristotle in Nuremberg Chronicle.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'' (1493) shows [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] philosopher [[Aristotle]] in scholar's clothing of the book's time, 1,800 years too modern for Aristotle]]

=== Parachronism &lt;!-- 'Parachronism' redirects here--&gt;===
A '''parachronism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|παρά}}, "on the side", and {{lang|grc|χρόνος}}, "time") is anything that appears in a time period in which it is not normally found (though not sufficiently out of place as to be impossible).

This may be an object, idiomatic expression, technology, philosophical idea, musical style, material, custom, or anything else so closely bound to a particular time period as to seem strange when encountered in a later era.  They may be objects or ideas that were once common but are now considered rare or inappropriate.  They can take the form of obsolete technology or outdated fashion.

Examples of parachronisms could include a suburban housewife in the United States around 1960 using a [[washboard (laundry)|washboard]] for laundry (well after [[washing machine]]s had become the norm); or a teenager from that time period being an avid fan of [[ragtime]] music. Often, a parachronism is identified when a work based on a particular era's state of knowledge is read within the context of a later era—with a different state of knowledge.  Many scientific works that rely on theories that have later been discredited have become anachronistic with the removal of those underpinnings, and works of [[speculative fiction]] often find their speculations outstripped by real-world technological developments or scientific discoveries.

=== Prochronism &lt;!-- 'Prochronism' redirects here--&gt;===
A '''prochronism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|πρό}}, "before", and {{lang|grc|χρόνος}}, "time") is an impossible anachronism which occurs when an object or idea has not yet been invented when the situation takes place, and therefore could not have possibly existed at the time (e.g. ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|The Last Supper]]'' by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] at the top of the article). A prochronism may be an object not yet developed, a verbal expression that had not yet been coined, a philosophy not yet formulated, a breed of animal not yet evolved (or perhaps engineered), or use of a technology that had not yet been created.

===Behavioral and cultural anachronism===
The intentional use of older, often obsolete cultural artifacts may be regarded as anachronistic. For example, it could be considered anachronistic for a modern-day person to wear a [[top hat]], write with a [[quill]], or carry on a conversation in Latin. Such choices may reflect an [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentricity]] or an [[aesthetic]] preference.

[[Image:Constantin Lecca - Infratirea moldovenilor si muntenilor.jpg|thumb|''Moldavians and [[Muntenia]]ns Become Brothers'': 19th-century flags in 16th-century scene]]
== Politically motivated anachronism ==
Some writings and works of art promoting a political, nationalist or revolutionary cause use anachronism to depict an institution or custom as being more ancient than it actually is. For example, the 19th-century Romanian painter [[Constantin Lecca]] depicts the peace agreement between [[Bogdan III cel Orb|Ioan Bogdan Voievod]] and [[Radu cel Mare|Radu Voievod]]—two leaders in Romania's 16th-century history—with the flags of [[Moldavia]] (blue-red) and of [[Wallachia]] (yellow-blue) seen in the background. These flags date only from the 1830s. Here anachronism promotes legitimacy for the unification of Moldavia and  Wallachia into the [[Kingdom of Romania]] at the time the painting was made.

== Art and literature ==
[[File:Lucas van Leyden - Lot and his Daughters - WGA12932.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lucas van Leyden]]'s 1520 painting ''Lot and His Daughters'' shows Biblical [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]] as a typical Dutch city of the painter's time.]]
Anachronism is used especially in works of imagination that rest on a historical basis. Anachronisms may be introduced in many ways: for example, in the disregard of the different modes of life and thought that characterize different periods, or in ignorance of the progress of the arts and sciences and other facts of history. They vary from glaring inconsistencies to scarcely perceptible misrepresentation. It is only since the close of the 18th century that this kind of deviation from historical reality has jarred on a general audience.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Sir [[Walter Scott]] justified the use of anachronism in historical literature: "It is necessary, for exciting interest of any kind, that the subject assumed should be, as it were, translated into the manners as well as the language of the age we live in."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Walter |last=Scott |authorlink=Walter Scott |title=Ivanhoe; a Romance |place=Edinburgh |year=1820 |volume=1 |page=xvii |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zzQJAAAAQAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as fashions move on, such attempts to use anachronisms to engage an audience may have quite the reverse effect, as the details in question are increasingly recognized as belonging neither to the historical era being represented, nor to the present, but to the intervening period in which the artwork was created. "Nothing becomes obsolete like a period vision of an older period", writes [[Anthony Grafton]]; "Hearing a mother in a historical movie of the 1940s call out 'Ludwig! [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]! Come in and practice your piano now!' we are jerked from our suspension of disbelief by what was intended as a means of reinforcing it, and plunged directly into the American bourgeois world of the filmmaker."&lt;ref&gt;Grafton 1990, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anachronism can also be an aesthetic choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/174817-for-infidelity-reconsidering-aesthetic-anachronism/|title=For Infidelity: Reconsidering Aesthetic Anachronism|last=Potthast|first=Jane|work=[[PopMatters]]|date=2013-09-18|accessdate=2014-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anachronisms abound in the works of [[Raffaello Santi|Raphael]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Raphael Santi: His Life and His Works|last=von Wolzogen|first=Alfred Freiherr|publisher=[[Smith, Elder &amp; Co.]]|year=1866|page=232|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ZhAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA232}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Shakespeare and the Uses of Antiquity: An Introductory Essay|last=Martindale |first=Michelle |publisher=[[Routledge]] |year=2005 |isbn=9781134848508 |pages=121–125 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PDwrK5FNnN0C&amp;pg=PA121}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in those of less celebrated painters and playwrights of earlier times. Anachronisms can exist in ancient texts. [[Carol Meyers]] says that these anachronisms can be used to better understand the stories by asking what the anachronism represents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/2014/02/14/276782474/the-genesis-of-camels |title=Archaeology Find: Camels In 'Bible' Are Literary Anachronisms|last=Montagne|first=Renee |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=2014-02-14|accessdate=2014-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Repeated anachronisms and historical errors can become an accepted part of popular culture, such as Roman legionaries that wear leather armor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2011-03-31/time-meddlers-anachronisms-in-print-and-on-film|title=Time meddlers: anachronisms in print and on film|last=Cole|first=Tom|work=[[Radio Times]]|date=2011-03-31|accessdate=2014-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Harikalar Diyari Flintstones 06029 nevit.jpg|thumb|[[Dinosaurs]] co-existing with [[hominid]]s, as here in ''[[The Flintstones]]'', is a relatively common anachronistic depiction in comics and animated cartoons.]]
=== Comical anachronism ===
[[Comedy]] fiction set in the past may use anachronism for humorous effect. Comedic anachronism can be used to make serious points about both historical and modern society, such as drawing parallels to political or social conventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/174969-hollywood-history-and-the-art-of-the-big-anachronism/|title=Hollywood, History, and the Art of the Big Anachronism|last=van Riper|first=A. Bowdoin|work=[[PopMatters]]|date=2013-09-26|accessdate=2014-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Future anachronism === &lt;!-- Section is linked from the redirected [Future anachronism] article; use caution. --&gt;
{{see also|Retrofuturism}}
[[File:Amazing_stories_193107.jpg|thumb|left|upright|In the future envisioned on this 1931 cover of ''[[Amazing Stories]]'', [[Propeller (aeronautics) |propeller airplanes]] would coexist with [[space technology]] advanced enough for a large-scale [[colonization of Mars]].]]

Even with careful research, [[science fiction]] writers risk anachronism as their works age because they cannot predict all political and technological change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Guide to Writing Fantasy and Science Fiction|last1=Athans|first1=Philip|authorlink1=Philip Athans|last2=Salvatore|first2=R. A.|authorlink2=R. A. Salvatore|publisher=[[Adams Media]]|year=2010|isbn=9781440507298|pages=167–170|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r9l5JO_FM6cC&amp;pg=PA167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, many books and films nominally set in the mid-21st century or later refer to the [[Soviet Union]], to [[Saint Petersburg]] in Russia as [[Leningrad]], to [[Cold War|the continuing struggle between the Eastern and Western Blocs]] and to [[History of Germany (1945–90)|divided Germany and divided Berlin]]. ''[[Star Trek]]'' has suffered from future anachronisms; instead of "[[Retroactive continuity|retconning]]" these errors, the [[Star Trek (film)|2009 film]] retained them for consistency with older franchises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/living-the-star-trek-life/|title=Living the Star Trek life|last=Glaskowsky|first=Peter|work=[[CNET]]|date=2009-05-08|accessdate=2014-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Buildings or natural features, such as the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]] in [[New York City]], can become out of place once they disappear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2002/12/06/AR2005033116653.html|title='Empire': Gangster Tale Sleeps With the Fishes|last=Hornaday|first=Ann|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=2002-12-06|accessdate=2014-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Language anachronism ===
[[Language]] anachronisms in novels and films are quite common, both intentional and unintentional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/02/26/172955182/historical-vocab-when-we-get-it-wrong-does-it-matter|title=Historical Vocab: When We Get It Wrong, Does It Matter?|last=Nunberg|first=Geoff|work=[[NPR]]|date=2013-02-26|accessdate=2014-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intentional anachronisms inform the audience more readily about a film set in the past. In this regard, language and pronunciation change so fast that most modern people (even many scholars) would find it difficult, or even impossible, to understand a film with dialogue in 15th-century English; thus, we [[Suspension of disbelief|willingly accept]] characters speaking an updated language, and modern [[slang]] and figures of speech are often used in these films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/26/magazine/the-way-we-live-now-3-26-00-on-language-anachronism.html|title=The Way We Live Now: 3-26-00: On Language; Anachronism |last=Safire |first=William |authorlink=William Safire|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2000-03-26|accessdate=2014-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subconscious anachronism==
[[File:RR5011-0017R.gif|thumbnail|right|A Russian commemorative coin depicting the meeting of Soviet and American troops at [[Torgau]] in 1945 shows the 50-star [[flag of the United States of America]], a flag not in use until 1960. The US flag used during the Second World War had 48 stars.]]

Unintentional anachronisms may occur even in what are intended as wholly objective and accurate records or representations of historic artifacts and artworks, because the recorder's perspective is conditioned by the assumptions and practices of his or her own times (a form of [[cultural bias]]). One example is the attribution of historically inaccurate beards to various [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Effigy|tomb effigies]] and figures in [[Medieval stained glass|stained glass]] in records made by English [[Antiquarian|antiquaries]] of the late 16th and early 17th centuries. Working in an age in which beards were in fashion and widespread, the antiquaries seem to have subconsciously projected the fashion back into an era in which it was rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harris |first=Oliver D. |title=Beards: true and false |journal=Church Monuments |volume=28 |year=2013 |pages=124–32 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Time travel==
The extensive science fiction subgenre depicting [[Time travel in fiction| time travel]] in effect consists of deliberate, consciously created anachronisms, letting people of one time meet and interact with those of another time. Covers of time-travel books often depict deliberate anachronisms of this kind. For example, the cover of [[Harry Turtledove]]'s ''[[The Guns of the South]]'' (1992) features a portrait of Confederate General [[Robert E. Lee]] holding an [[AK-47]] rifle.

== In academia ==
In historical writing, the most common type of anachronism is the adoption of the political, social or cultural concerns and assumptions of one era to interpret or evaluate the events and actions of another. The anachronistic application of present-day perspectives to comment on the historical past is sometimes described as [[Presentism (literary and historical analysis)|presentism]]. [[Empiricism|Empiricist]] [[historian]]s, working in the traditions established by [[Leopold von Ranke]] in the 19th century, regard this as a great error, and a trap to be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Stephen |last=Davies |title=Empiricism and History |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |place=Basingstoke |year=2003 |page=29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur Marwick]] has argued that "a grasp of the fact that past societies are very different from our own, and ... very difficult to get to know" is an essential and fundamental skill of the professional historian; and that "anachronism is still one of the most obvious faults when the unqualified (those expert in other disciplines, perhaps) attempt to do history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Arthur |last=Marwick |authorlink=Arthur Marwick |title=The New Nature of History: knowledge, evidence, language |place=Basingstoke |publisher=Palgrave |year=2001 |isbn=0-333-96447-0 |page=63 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anachronism in academic writing is considered at best embarrassing, as in early-20th-century scholarship's use of [[Translatio imperii]], first formulated in the 12th century, to interpret 10th-century literature.

The use of anachronism in a rhetorical or hyperbolic sense is more complex. To refer to the [[Holy Roman Empire]] as the First [[Reich]], for example, is technically inaccurate but may be a useful comparative exercise; the application of theory to works which predate [[Marxist]], [[Feminist]] or [[Freudian]] subjectivities is considered an essential part of theoretical practice. In most cases, however, the practitioner will acknowledge or justify the use or context.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Detection of anachronism==

The ability to identify anachronisms may be employed as a critical and forensic tool to demonstrate the fraudulence of a document or artifact purporting to be from an earlier time. [[Anthony Grafton]] discusses, for example, the work of the 3rd-century philosopher [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], of [[Isaac Casaubon]] (1559–1614), and of [[Richard August Reitzenstein|Richard Reitzenstein]] (1861–1931), all of whom succeeded in exposing literary forgeries and plagiarisms, such as those included in the "[[Hermetica|Hermetic Corpus]]", through – among other techniques – the recognition of anachronisms.&lt;ref&gt;Grafton 1990, pp. 75–98.&lt;/ref&gt; The detection of anachronisms is an important element within the scholarly discipline of [[diplomatics]], the critical analysis of the forms of documents, developed by the [[Maurist]] scholar [[Jean Mabillon]] (1632–1707) and his successors [[René-Prosper Tassin]] (1697–1777) and [[Charles-François Toustain]] (1700–1754). The philosopher and reformer [[Jeremy Bentham]] wrote at the beginning of the 19th century:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The falsehood of a writing will often be detected, by its making direct mention of, or allusions more or less indirect to, some fact posterior to the date which it bears. ... ''The mention of posterior facts;'' – first indication of forgery.&lt;br&gt;

In a living language there are always variations in words, in the meaning of words, in the construction of phrases, in the manner of spelling, which may detect the age of a writing, and lead to legitimate suspicions of forgery. ...

The exposure by [[Lorenzo Valla]] in 1440 of the so-called [[Donation of Constantine]], a decree purportedly issued by the [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Constantine the Great]] in either 315 or 317 AD, as a later forgery, depended to a considerable degree on the identification of anachronisms, such as references to the city of [[Constantinople]] (a name not in fact bestowed until 330 AD). A large number of apparent [[anachronisms in the Book of Mormon]] have served to convince critics that the book was written in the 19th century, and not, as its adherents claim, in [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] America. The use of 19th- and 20th-century [[antisemitism|anti-semitic]] terminology demonstrates that the purported "[[Franklin Prophecy]]" (attributed to [[Benjamin Franklin]], who died in 1790) is a forgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/special_reports/franklin_prophecy/print.asp |title=Anti-Semitic Myth: The Franklin "Prophecy" |publisher=Adl.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ""[[William Lynch speech]]", an address, supposedly delivered in 1712, on the control of slaves in [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]], is now considered to be a 20th-century forgery, partly on account of its use of anachronistic terms such as "program" and "refueling".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ferris.edu/htmls/news/jimcrow/question/may04.htm |title=Is Willie Lynch's Letter Real? |last=Cobb |first=W.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Annales'' school}} 
The '''''Annales'' school''' ({{IPA-fr|a'nal}}) is a group of historians associated with a style of [[historiography]] developed by French [[historians]] in the 20th century to stress long-term [[social history]]. It is named after its scholarly journal ''[[Annales d'histoire économique et sociale]]'', which remains the main source of scholarship, along with many books and monographs.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.editions.ehess.fr/revues/annales-histoire-sciences-sociales/numeros-parus/ for recent issues]&lt;/ref&gt; The school has been highly influential in setting the agenda for historiography in France and numerous other countries, especially regarding the use of [[social science|social scientific]] methods by historians, emphasizing social rather than political or diplomatic themes, and for being generally hostile to the class analysis of [[Marxist historiography]].

The school deals primarily with [[Late Middle Ages|late medieval]] and [[Early modern period|early modern]] Europe (before the [[French Revolution]]), with little interest in later topics. It has dominated French social history and influenced historiography in Europe and Latin America. Prominent leaders include co-founders [[Lucien Febvre]] (1878–1956), [[Henri Hauser]] (1866-1946) and [[Marc Bloch]] (1886–1944).  The second generation was led by [[Fernand Braudel]] (1902–1985) and included [[Georges Duby]] (1919–1996), [[Pierre Goubert]] (1915–2012), [[Robert Mandrou]] (1921–1984), [[Pierre Chaunu]] (1923–2009), [[Jacques Le Goff]] (1924–2014), and [[Ernest Labrousse]] (1895–1988). Institutionally it is based on the ''Annales'' journal, the SEVPEN publishing house, the {{Lang|fr|Fondation Maison des sciences de l'homme}} (FMSH), and especially the 6th Section of the [[École pratique des hautes études]], all based in Paris.  A third generation was led by [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]] (1929– ) and includes Jacques Revel,&lt;ref&gt;Since 1978, Revel has taught at the [[École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales]] (Paris), where he is ''directeur d'études'' (full professor); he served as president of the École from 1995 to 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Philippe Ariès]] (1914–1984), who joined the group in 1978.  The third generation stressed [[History of mentalities|history from the point of view of mentalities]], or ''mentalités''.  The fourth generation of Annales historians, led by [[Roger Chartier]] (1945– ), clearly distanced itself from the mentalities approach, replaced by the [[Cultural turn|cultural]] and [[linguistic turn]], which emphasize analysis of the social history of cultural practices.
  
The main scholarly outlet has been the journal ''Annales d'Histoire Economique et Sociale'' ("Annals of Economic and Social History"), founded in 1929 by Lucien Febvre and Marc Bloch, which broke radically with traditional historiography by insisting on the importance of taking all levels of society into consideration and emphasized the collective nature of mentalities. Its contributors viewed events as less fundamental than the mental frameworks that shaped decisions and practices
Janmesh Kokate was editor of ''Annales committee '' from 2003 to present, followed by the medievalist Jacques Le Goff. However,  informal successor as head of the school was Le Roy Ladurie. Noting the political upheavals in Europe and especially in France in 1968, [[Eric Hobsbawm]] argues that "in France the virtual hegemony of Braudelian history and the ''Annales'' came to an end after 1968, and the international influence of the journal dropped steeply."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eric J. Hobsbawm|title=Interesting Times: A Twentieth-century Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VBQqAAAAYAAJ|year=2003|publisher=Pantheon Books|page=295|isbn=9780375422348}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Multiple responses were attempted by the school. Scholars moved in multiple directions, covering in disconnected fashion the social, economic, and cultural history of different eras and different parts of the globe. By the time of crisis the school was building a vast publishing and research network reaching across France, Europe, and the rest of the world. Influence indeed spread out from Paris, but few new ideas came in. Much emphasis was given to quantitative data, seen as the key to unlocking all of social history.&lt;ref&gt;One of numerous spin-off journals was ''Histoire &amp; mesure'' (1986– ), devoted to quantitative history.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Annales ignored the developments in quantitative studies underway in the U.S. and Britain, which reshaped economic, political, and demographic research.&lt;ref&gt;Georg G. Iggers, ''Historiography in the Twentieth Century: From Scientific Objectivity to the Postmodern Challenge," 59–61.&lt;/ref&gt;  An attempt to require an ''Annales''-written textbook for French schools was rejected by the government.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; By 1980 [[postmodern]] sensibilities undercut confidence in overarching metanarratives. As [[Jacques Revel]] notes, the success of the Annales School, especially its use of social structures as explanatory forces, contained the seeds of its own downfall, for there is "no longer any implicit consensus on which to base the unity of the social, identified with the real."&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Revel and Lynn Hunt, "Microanalysis and the Construction of the Social," in ''Histories: French Constructions of the Past,'' ed. by Jacques Revel and Lynn Hunt (1995) 480.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Annales School kept its infrastructure, but lost its ''mentalités''.&lt;ref&gt;On the decline of Annales, see Hunt (1986); for a summary of the movement see Burke, ''French Historical Revolution'', 106–107.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The journal==
{{main article|Annales d'histoire économique et sociale}}
The journal began in Strasbourg as ''Annales d'histoire économique et sociale''; it moved to Paris and kept the same name from 1929 to 1939. It was successively renamed ''Annales d'histoire sociale'' (1939–1942, 1945), ''Mélanges d'histoire sociale'' (1942–1944), ''Annales. Economies, sociétés, civilisations'' (1946–1994), and ''Annales. Histoire, Sciences Sociales'' (1994– ).&lt;ref name="journal names"&gt;P. Burke, ''The French Historical Revolution. The Annales School 1929–89'', p. 116 n. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962 Braudel and Gaston Berger used Ford Foundation money and government funds to create a new independent foundation, the {{Lang|fr|Fondation Maison des sciences de l'homme}} (FMSH), which Braudel directed from 1970 until his death. In 1970 the 6th Section and the ''Annales'' relocated to the FMSH building.  FMSH set up elaborate international networks to spread the ''Annales'' gospel across Europe and the world. In 2013 it began publication of an English language edition, with all the articles translated.

The scope of topics covered by the journal is vast and experimental—there is a search for total history and new approaches. The emphasis is on social history, and very long-term trends, often using quantification and paying special attention to geography&lt;ref&gt;See Lucien Febvre, ''La Terre et l'évolution humaine'' (1922), translated as ''A Geographical Introduction to History'' (London, 1932).&lt;/ref&gt; and to the intellectual world view of common people, or "mentality" (''mentalité''). Little attention is paid to political, diplomatic, or military history, or to biographies of famous men.  Instead the ''Annales'' focused attention on the synthesizing of historical patterns identified from social, economic, and cultural history, statistics, medical reports, family studies, and even psychoanalysis.

==Origins==
The ''Annales'' was founded and edited by [[Marc Bloch]] and [[Lucien Febvre]] in 1929, while they were teaching at the [[University of Strasbourg]] and later in Paris. These authors, the former a medieval historian and the latter an early modernist, quickly became associated with the distinctive ''Annales'' approach, which combined geography, history, and the sociological approaches of the ''[[Année Sociologique]]'' (many members of which were their colleagues at Strasbourg) to produce an approach which rejected the predominant emphasis on politics, diplomacy and war of many 19th and early 20th-century historians as spearheaded by historians whom Febvre called Les Sorbonnistes. Instead, they pioneered an approach to a study of long-term historical structures (''la [[longue durée]]'') over events and political transformations.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Jones, "Olwen Hufton's 'Poor', Richard Cobb's 'People', and the Notions of the longue durée in French Revolutionary Historiography," ''Past &amp; Present,'' 2006 Supplement (Volume 1), pp. 178–203 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/past_and_present/v2006/2006.1Sjones.html in Project Muse]&lt;/ref&gt;  Geography, material culture, and what later Annalistes called ''mentalités,'' or the psychology of the epoch, are also characteristic areas of study. The goal of the Annales was to undo the work of the Sorbonnistes, to turn French historians away from the narrowly political and diplomatic toward the new vistas in social and economic history.&lt;ref&gt;J.H. Hexter, "Fernand Braudel and the Monde Braudellien," '' Historians,'' pp. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

Co-founder [[Marc Bloch]] (1886–1944) was a quintessential modernist who studied at the elite École Normale Supérieure, and in Germany, serving as a professor at the University of Strasbourg until he was called to the Sorbonne in Paris in 1936 as professor of economic history.  Bloch's interests were  highly interdisciplinary, influenced by the geography of [[Paul Vidal de la Blache]] (1845–1918)&lt;ref&gt;Jason Hilkovitch &amp; Max Fulkerson, "Paul Vidal de la Blache: A biographical sketch" at

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the sociology of [[Émile Durkheim]] (1858–1917).  His own ideas, especially those expressed in his masterworks, ''French Rural History'' (''Les caractères originaux de l'histoire rurale française,'' 1931) and ''Feudal Society'', were incorporated by the second-generation Annalistes, led by [[Fernand Braudel]].

==Precepts==
[[Georges Duby]], a leader of the school, wrote that the history he taught:
:relegated the sensational to the sidelines and was reluctant to give a simple accounting of events, but strived on the contrary to pose and solve problems and, neglecting surface disturbances, to observe the long and medium-term evolution of economy, society and civilisation.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Duby, ''Le dimanche de Bouvines'' (1973), forward&lt;/ref&gt;
The Annalistes, especially [[Lucien Febvre]], advocated a ''histoire totale'', or ''histoire tout court'', a complete study of a historic problem.

==Postwar==
Bloch was shot by the [[Gestapo]] during the [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|German occupation of France]] in World War II for his active membership of the [[French Resistance]], and Febvre carried on the ''Annales'' approach in the 1940s and 1950s. It was during this time that he mentored Braudel, who would become one of the best-known exponents of this school. Braudel's work came to define a "second" era of ''Annales'' historiography and was very influential throughout the 1960s and 1970s, especially for his work on the Mediterranean region in the era of [[Philip II of Spain]]. 
Braudel developed the idea, often associated with Annalistes, of different modes of historical time: ''l'histoire quasi immobile'' (the quasi motionless history) of historical geography, the history of social, political and economic structures (''la [[longue durée]]''), and the history of men and events, in the context of their structures.

While authors such as [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]], [[Marc Ferro]] and [[Jacques Le Goff]] continue to carry the ''Annales'' banner, today the ''Annales'' approach has been less distinctive as more and more historians do work in [[cultural history]], [[political history]] and [[economic history]].

==''Mentalités''==
Bloch's ''Les Rois Thaumaturges'' (1924)&lt;ref&gt;Translated as ''The Royal Touch: Monarchy and Miracles in France and England'' (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; looked at the long-standing folk belief that the king could cure [[scrofula]] by his [[royal touch|thaumaturgic touch]].  The kings of France and England indeed regularly practiced the ritual.  Bloch was not concerned with the effectiveness of the royal touch—he acted instead like an anthropologist in asking why people believed it and how it shaped relations between king and commoner. The book was highly influential in introducing comparative studies (in this case France and England), as well as long durations ("longue durée") studies spanning several centuries, even up to a thousand years, downplaying short-term events.  Bloch's revolutionary charting of mentalities, or ''mentalités'', resonated with scholars who were reading [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] and [[Marcel Proust|Proust]]. In the 1960s, [[Robert Mandrou]] and [[Georges Duby]] harmonized the concept of ''mentalité'' history with [[Fernand Braudel]]'s structures of historical time and linked mentalities with changing social conditions. A flood of ''mentalité'' studies based on these approaches appeared during the 1970s and 1980s. By the 1990s, however, ''mentalité'' history had become interdisciplinary to the point of fragmentation, but still lacked a solid theoretical basis. While not explicitly rejecting ''mentalité'' history, younger historians increasingly turned to other approaches.

==Braudel==
Fernand Braudel became the leader of the second generation after 1945. He obtained funding from the Rockefeller Foundation in New York and founded the 6th Section of the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes, which was devoted to the study of history and the social sciences.  It became an independent degree-granting institution in 1975 under the name [[School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences|École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales]] (EHESS).  Braudel's followers admired his use of the longue durée approach to stress slow, and often imperceptible effects of space, climate and technology on the actions of human beings in the past.  The ''Annales'' historians, after living through two world wars and incredible political upheavals in France, were deeply uncomfortable with the notion that multiple ruptures and discontinuities created history. They preferred to stress inertia and the longue durée. Special attention was paid to geography, climate, and demography as long-term factors. They believed the continuities of the deepest structures were central to history, beside which upheavals in institutions or the superstructure of social life were of little significance, for history lies beyond the reach of conscious actors, especially the will of revolutionaries. They rejected the Marxist idea that history should be used as a tool to foment and foster revolutions. In turn the Marxists called them conservatives.&lt;ref&gt;Olivia Harris, "Braudel: Historical Time and the Horror of Discontinuity." ''History Workshop Journal'' (2004) (57): 161–174. {{ISSN|1363-3554}} Fulltext: [[OUP]]. Only Ariès was a true conservative—indeed a royalist.&lt;/ref&gt;

Braudel's first book, ''La Méditerranée et le Monde Méditerranéen à l'Epoque de Philippe II'' (1949) (''The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II'') was his most influential.  This vast panoramic view used ideas from other social sciences, employed effectively the technique of the longue durée, and downplayed the importance of specific events and individuals.  It stressed geography but not ''mentalité''. It was widely admired, but most historians did not try to replicate it and instead focused on their specialized monographs. The book dramatically raised the worldwide profile of the Annales School.

==Regionalism==
Before ''Annales,'' French history supposedly happened in Paris. Febvre broke decisively with this paradigm in 1912, with his sweeping doctoral thesis on ''[[Philip II of Spain|Philippe II]] et la [[Franche-Comté]].'' The geography and social structure of this region overwhelmed and shaped the king's policies.

The ''Annales'' historians did not try to replicate Braudel's vast geographical scope in ''La Méditerranée.'' Instead they focused on regions in France over long stretches of time. The most important was the study of the ''Peasants of Languedoc'' by Braudel's star pupil and successor Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie.&lt;ref&gt;Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, ''The Peasants of Languedoc,'' (1966, translated 1977) [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0252006356 excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;  The regionalist tradition flourished especially in the 1960s and 1970s in the work of Pierre Goubert in 1960 on Beauvais and René Baehrel on Basse-Provence. ''Annales'' historians in the 1970s and 1980s turned to urban regions, including Pierre Deyon (Amiens), Maurice Garden (Lyon), Jean-Pierre Bardet (Rouen), Georges Freche (Toulouse), and Jean-Claude Perrot (Caen). By the 1970s the shift was underway from the earlier economic history to cultural history and the history of mentalities.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Hinrichs, "Provinzen, Landschaften, Regionen in Der Modernen Französischen Geschichtswissenschaft – Ein Essay," ''Blätter Für Deutsche Landesgeschichte'' 1994 130: 1–12. {{ISSN|0006-4408}} Fulltext: [http://periodika.digitale-sammlungen.de/bdlg/Blatt_bsb00000334,00007.html online edition]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact outside France==
The ''Annales'' school systematically reached out to create an impact on other countries.  Its success varied widely.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, ''French Historical Revolution'' (1990) ch 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Annales'' approach was especially well received in [[Italy]] and [[Poland]]. [[Franciszek Bujak]] (1875–1953) and [[Jan Rutkowski]] (1886–1949), the founders of modern economic history in Poland and of the journal ''Roczniki Dziejów Spolecznych i Gospodarczych'' (1931– ), were attracted to the innovations of the Annales school. Rutkowski was in contact with Bloch and others, and published in the ''Annales.'' After the Communists took control in the 1940s Polish scholars were safer working on the Middle Ages and the early modern era rather than contemporary history. After the "[[Polish October]]" of 1956 the Sixth Section in Paris welcomed Polish historians and exchanges between the circle of the ''Annales'' and Polish scholars continued until the early 1980s. The reciprocal influence between the French school and Polish historiography was particularly evident in studies on the Middle Ages and the early modern era studied by Braudel.&lt;ref&gt;Anita Krystyna Shelton, ''The Democratic Idea in Polish History and Historiography'' (1989). Even the Marxist journal ''Kwartalnik Historii Kultury Materialnej,'' founded in 1953, had an ''Annales'' flavor.&lt;/ref&gt;

In South America the ''Annales'' approach became popular. From the 1950s [[Federico Brito Figueroa]] was the founder of a new Venezuelan historiography based largely on the ideas of the Annales School. Brito Figueroa carried his conception of the field to all levels of university study, emphasizing a systematic and scientific approach to history and placing it squarely in the social sciences.  Spanish historiography was influenced by the "Annales School" starting in 1950 with Jaime Vincens Vives (1910–1960).&lt;ref&gt;Nil Santiáñez-Tió, "Temporalidad y discurso histórico: Propuesta de una renovación metodológica de la historia de la literatura española moderna." [Temporality and Historical Discourse: Proposal of a Methodological Renewal of the History of Modern Spanish Literature]. ''Hispanic Review'' 1997 65(3): 267–290. {{ISSN|0018-2176}} Fulltext: [https://www.jstor.org/stable/474948  in Jstor]&lt;/ref&gt;   In Mexico, exiled Republican intellectuals extended the Annales approach, particularly from the Center for Historical Studies of El Colegio de México, the leading graduate studies institution of Latin America.

British historians, apart from a few Marxists, were generally hostile. Academic historians decidedly sided with [[Geoffrey Elton]]'s ''[[The Practice of History]]'' against [[Edward Hallett Carr]]'s ''[[What Is History?]]''. One of the few British historians who were sympathetic towards the work of the ''Annales'' school was [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]]. American, German, Indian, Russian and Japanese scholars generally ignored the school. The Americans developed their own form of "new social history" from entirely different roots.  Both the American and the ''Annales'' historians picked up important family reconstitution techniques from French demographer [[Louis Henry]].&lt;ref&gt;Burke, ''French Historical Revolution'' (1990), pp 56, 96–100.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Wageningen University and Research Centre|Wageningen]] school centered on [[Bernard Slicher van Bath]] was viewed internationally as a Dutch counterpart of the Annales school, although Slicher van Bath himself vehemently rejected the idea of a quantitative "school" of historiography.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |first=Jan |last=Kuys |title=Bernard Hendrik Slicher van Bath |encyclopedia=Biografisch Woordenboek Gelderland |publisher=Verloren |year=2006 |url=http://www.biografischwoordenboekgelderland.nl/bio/6_Bernard_Hendrik_Slicher_van_Bath}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Has been cited as a key influence in the development of [[World Systems Theory]] by sociologist [[Immanuel Wallerstein]].&lt;ref&gt;Wallerstein, Immanuel M. 2004. World-Systems Analysis: An Introduction. Durham, NC: Duke University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current==
The current leader is [[Roger Chartier]], who is Directeur d'Études at the [[School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences|École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales]] in Paris, Professeur in the [[Collège de France]], and Annenberg Visiting Professor of History at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. He frequently lectures and teaches in the United States, Spain, Mexico, Brazil and Argentina. His work in Early Modern European History focuses on the history of education, the history of the book and the history of reading.  Recently, he has been concerned with the relationship between written culture as a whole and literature (particularly theatrical plays) for France, England and Spain. His work in this specific field (based on the criss-crossing between literary criticism, bibliography, and sociocultural history) is connected to broader historiographical and methodological interests which deal with the relation between history and other disciplines: philosophy, sociology, anthropology.

Chartier's typical undergraduate course focuses upon the making, remaking, dissemination, and reading of texts in early modern Europe and America. Under the heading of "practices," his class considers how readers read and marked up their books, forms of note-taking, and the interrelation between reading and writing from copying and translating to composing new texts. Under the heading of "materials," his class examines the relations between different kinds of writing surfaces (including stone, wax, parchment, paper, walls, textiles, the body, and the heart), writing implements (including styluses, pens, pencils, needles, and brushes), and material forms (including scrolls, erasable tables, codices, broadsides and printed forms and books). Under the heading of "places," his class explores where texts were made, read, and listened to, including monasteries, schools and universities, offices of the state, the shops of merchants and booksellers, printing houses, theaters, libraries, studies, and closets. The texts for his course include the ''Bible'', translations of Ovid, ''Hamlet'', ''Don Quixote'', Montaigne's essays, Pepys's diary, Richardson's ''Pamela'', and Franklin's autobiography.

"'''Arrested decay'''" is a term coined by the State of [[California]], [[United States]] to explain how it would preserve its [[Bodie, California|Bodie State Historic Park]].  A more common application of this concept is the preservation of war ruins as memorials.

== United States ==
At [[Bodie, California|Bodie State Historic Park]], the structures will be maintained, but only to the extent that they will not be allowed to fall over or otherwise deteriorate in a major way.

Any building that was standing in 1962, when Bodie became a State Park, may be rebuilt or preserved as the photographs of 1962 showed them. By putting new roofs on the buildings, rebuilding foundations, and resealing glass that is in window frames, the State is able to keep buildings from naturally decaying.

[[Eastern State Penitentiary]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] uses a similar system, though it uses the term "'''preserved ruin'''."

== Croatia ==
The authorities in [[Vukovar]], [[Croatia]] decided to keep the [[Vukovar water tower|old water tower in the city]] as it is found today and as it had become after the war &amp;mdash; gnarled by [[artillery]].

== Berlin, Germany ==
Several buildings destroyed in the [[World War II|Second World War]] have been preserved in their ruined condition as memorials.  These include part of the facade of the [[Berlin Anhalter Bahnhof|Anhalter Bahnhof]] and the belfry of the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church]].

== Sarajevo, Bosnia ==
The authorities in [[Sarajevo]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] have also preserved the building of the daily newspaper [[Oslobođenje]] to this day the way it was shelled during the [[Bosnian War]].

== Hiroshima, Japan ==
In 1996,  the [[Hiroshima Peace Memorial]]  was acknowledged as a [[World Heritage Site|Unesco World Heritage Site]]. Originally completed in 1905, the building was known at the time of the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki#Hiroshima|Hiroshima atomic bomb explosion]] on August 6, 1945  as the ''Hiroshima Prefectural Industrial Promotion Hall''. Although suffering considerable damage, it was the closest structure to the [[hypocenter]] of the explosion to withstand the blast without being leveled to the ground. It has been preserved in the condition it was in after the bombing to serve as a symbol of hope for [[world peace]] and [[nuclear disarmament]].

== Oradour-sur-Glane, France ==
[[Oradour-sur-Glane]] was a village in the [[Limousin (region)|Limousin]] [[Regions of France|région]] of [[France]] that was destroyed on 10 June 1944, when 642 of its inhabitants &amp;ndash; men, women and children &amp;ndash; were murdered by a [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Waffen-SS]] company. Although a new village was built after World War II, away from the ruins of the former village, the old village &amp;ndash; the site of the massacre &amp;ndash; still stands as a memorial to the dead and as being representative of similar sites and events. Part of the memorial includes items recovered from the burned out buildings: watches stopped at the time their owners were burned alive; glasses &amp;ndash; melted from the intense heat; and various personal items and money.

'''Balik''' ({{lang-bg|Балик}}, [[Byzantine Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Μπαλίκας}}; fl. c. 1320 and died 1347) was a noble of the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]] who increased the autonomy of his province and became [[Despot (court title)|despot]] of the [[Principality of Karvuna]]. During the [[Byzantine civil war of 1341–1347]] he supported the regent [[Anna of Savoy]] against pretender [[John VI Kantakouzenos]]. Balik died in 1347, either during an outbreak of the [[Black Death]] or killed during a retaliation campaign led by [[Umur Beg]], on behalf of [[John V Palaiologos]], that destroyed Dobruja's seaports. His brother [[Dobrotitsa]] succeeded him.

A '''calendar era''' is the '''year numbering''' system used by a [[calendar]]. For example, the [[Gregorian calendar]] numbers its years in the Western [[Christian era]] (the [[Coptic Orthodox Church|Coptic Orthodox]] and [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church|Ethiopian Orthodox]] churches have their own Christian eras). The instant, date, or year from which time is marked is called the ''[[epoch (reference date)|epoch]]'' of the era. There are many different calendar eras such as [[Saka Era]].

In antiquity, [[regnal year]]s were counted from the accession of a monarch. This makes the [[Chronology of the ancient Near East]] very difficult to reconstruct, based on disparate and scattered king lists, such as the [[Sumerian King List]] and the Babylonian [[Canon of Kings]]. In East Asia, reckoning by [[era name]]s chosen by ruling monarchs ceased in the 20th century except for [[Japan]], where they are still used.

==Ancient dating systems==

===Assyrian eponyms===
{{main|Eponym dating system}}

For over a thousand years, ancient [[Assyria]] used a system of [[Eponym dating system|eponyms]] to identify each year. Each year at the [[Akitu]] festival (celebrating the Mesopotamian new year), one of a small group of high officials (including the king in later periods) would be chosen by lot to serve as the ''[[limmu]]'' for the year, which meant that he would preside over the Akitu festival and the year would bear his name. The earliest attested ''limmu'' eponyms are from the Assyrian trading colony at [[Kültepe|Karum Kanesh]] in Anatolia, dating to the very beginning of the 2nd millennium BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CDLI: The Old and Middle Assyrian limmu officials|url=http://cdli.ox.ac.uk/wiki/doku.php?id=list_of_old_assyrian_limmu_officials|website=Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative|accessdate=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they continued in use until the end of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Neo-Assyrian Period]], ca. 612 BC.

Assyrian scribes compiled ''limmu'' lists, including an unbroken sequence of almost 250 eponyms from the early 1st millennium BC. This is an invaluable chronological aid, because a solar eclipse was recorded as having taken place in the ''limmu'' of Bur-Sagale, governor of [[Tell Halaf|Guzana]]. Astronomers have identified this eclipse as [[Assyrian eclipse|one that took place on 15 June, 763 BC]], which has allowed absolute dates of 892 to 648 BC to be assigned to that sequence of eponyms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Millard|first1=Alan|title=The Eponyms of the Assyrian Empire, 910-612 BC (State Archives of Assyria Studies, Vol. 2)|date=1994|publisher=Neo-Assyrian Text Corpus Project|location=Helsinki|isbn=978-9514567155}}&lt;/ref&gt; This list of absolute dates has allowed many of the events of the Neo-Assyrian Period to be dated to a specific year, avoiding the [[Chronology of the ancient Near East|chronological debates]] that characterize earlier periods of Mesopotamian history.

===Olympiad dating===
Among the ancient Greek historians and scholars, a common method of indicating the passage of years was based on the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]], first held in [[776 BC]]. The Olympic Games provided the various independent city-states with a mutually recognizable system of dates. Olympiad dating was not used in everyday life. This system was in use from the 3rd century BC. The modern Olympic Games (or Summer Olympic Games beginning 1896) do not continue the four year periods from ancient Greece: the 669th Olympiad would have begun in the summer of 1897, but the modern Olympics were first held in 1896.&lt;ref name=Oxford&gt;Blackburn, B. &amp; Holford-Strevens, L. (1999, 2003). ''The Oxford Companion to the Year: an exploration of calendar customs and time-reckoning'' (corrected printing). Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-214231-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|769}}

===Indiction cycles===
Another common system was the [[indiction]] cycle (15 indictions made up an agricultural tax cycle in Roman Egypt, an indiction being a year in duration). Documents and events began to be dated by the year of the cycle (e.g., "fifth indiction", "tenth indiction") in the 4th century, and this system was used long after the tax ceased to be collected. It was used in [[Gaul]], in [[Egypt]], and in most parts of Greece until the [[Islamic conquest of Egypt|Islamic conquest]], and in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] until its conquest in 1453. 

The rule for computing the indiction from the AD year number, which he had just invented, was stated by [[Dionysius Exiguus]]: add 3 and divide by 15; the remainder is the indiction, with 0 understood to be the fifteenth indiction.&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;{{rp|770}} Thus 2001 was the ninth indiction.&lt;ref&gt;Nautical Almanac Office of the [[United States Naval Observatory]] and [[Her Majesty's Nautical Almanac Office]]. (2000)''[[The Nautical Almanac]] for the year 2001''. [[Washington, DC]]: [[Government Printing Office]] and [[London, England]], UK: [[The Stationery Office]]. p. B4.&lt;/ref&gt; The beginning of the year for the indiction varied.&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;{{rp|769–71}}

===Seleucid era===
{{main|Seleucid era}}

The Seleucid era was used in much of the Middle East from the 4th century BC to the 6th century AD, and continued until the 10th century AD among Oriental Christians. The era is computed from the epoch 312 BC: in August of that year [[Seleucus I Nicator]] captured [[Babylon]] and began his reign over the Asian portions of [[Alexander the Great]]'s empire. Thus depending on whether the calendar year is taken as starting on 1 [[Tishri]] or on 1 [[Nisan]] (respectively the start of the Jewish civil and ecclesiastical years) the Seleucid era begins either in 311 BC (the Jewish reckoning) or in 312 BC (the Greek reckoning: October–September).

===Ancient Rome===

====Consular dating====
An early and common practice was Roman '[[Roman consul|consular]]' dating. This involved naming both [[Consul Ordinarius|''consules ordinarii'']] who had taken up this office on January 1 (since 153 BC) of the relevant civil year.&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;{{rp|6}} Sometimes one or both consuls might not be appointed until November or December of the previous year, and news of the appointment may not have reached parts of the Roman empire for several months into the current year; thus we find the occasional inscription where the year is defined as "after the consulate" of a pair of consuls.

The use of consular dating ended in AD 541 when the emperor [[Justinian I]] discontinued appointing consuls. The last consul nominated was [[Anicius Faustus Albinus Basilius]]. Soon afterwards, imperial regnal dating was adopted in its place.

====Dating from the founding of Rome====
Another method of dating, rarely used, was ''[[anno urbis conditae]]'' (Latin: "in the year of the founded city" (abbreviated AUC), where "city" meant Rome). (It is often incorrectly given that AUC stands for ''[[ab urbe condita]]'', which is the title of [[Livy|Titus Livius]]'s history of Rome.)

Several epochs were in use by Roman historians. Modern historians usually adopt the epoch of [[Varro]], which we place in 753 BC.

The system was introduced by [[Marcus Terentius Varro]] in the 1st century BC. The first day of its year was Founder's Day (April 21), although most modern historians assume that it coincides with the modern historical year (January 1 to December 31). It was rarely used in the [[Roman calendar]] and in the early Julian calendar – naming the two [[consul]]s that held office in a particular year was dominant. AD {{CURRENTYEAR}} is thus approximately the same as AUC {{#expr: {{CURRENTYEAR}}+753}} ({{CURRENTYEAR}} + 753).

About AD 400, the Iberian historian [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]] used the AUC era. Pope [[Boniface IV]] (about AD 600) may have been the first to use both the AUC era and the ''Anno Domini'' era (he put AD 607 = AUC 1360).{{Citation needed|date=December 2007|reason='although it occurs occasionally in papal documents of the time of John XIII (965-972), it was not the rule before the twelfth century': http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04636c.htm - and that's not even about using abbreviations}}

====Regnal years of Roman emperors====
Another system that is less commonly found than might be thought was the use of the [[regnal year]] of the [[Roman emperor]]. At first, [[Augustus]] indicated the year of his reign by counting how many times he had held the office of consul, and how many times the [[Roman Senate]] had granted him [[Tribune|Tribunican]] powers, carefully observing the fiction that his powers came from these offices granted to him, rather than from his own person or the many [[Roman legion|legion]]s under his control. His successors followed his practice until the memory of the [[Roman Republic]] faded (about AD 200), when they began to use their regnal year openly.

====Dating from the Roman conquest====
Some regions of the [[Roman Empire]] dated their calendars from the date of Roman conquest, or the establishment of Roman rule.

The [[Spanish era]] counted the years from 38 BC, probably the date of a new tax imposed by the Roman Republic on the subdued population of Iberia. The date marked the establishment of Roman rule in Spain and was used in official documents in Portugal, [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], and in [[Crown of Castile|Castile]], into the 14th century. This system of calibrating years fell to disuse in 1381 and was replaced by today's ''Anno Domini''.&lt;ref&gt;Gedaliah ibn Jechia the Spaniard, ''Shalshelet Ha-Kabbalah'', Jerusalem 1962, p. 271 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the Roman and Byzantine periods, the [[Decapolis]] and other Hellenized cities of Syria and Palestine used the [[Pompeian era]], counting dates from the Roman general [[Pompey]]'s conquest of the region in 63 BC.

===Maya===
A different form of calendar was used to track longer periods of time, and for the inscription of calendar dates (i.e., identifying when one event occurred in relation to others). This form, known as the Long Count, is based upon the number of elapsed days since a mythological starting-point. According to the calibration between the Long Count and Western calendars accepted by the great majority of Maya researchers (known as the GMT correlation), this starting-point is equivalent to August 11, 3114 BC in the proleptic Gregorian calendar or 6 September in the Julian calendar (−3113 astronomical).

===Other dating systems===
A great many local systems or [[era]]s were also important, for example the year from the foundation of one particular city, the regnal year of the neighboring [[History of Persia|Persian emperor]], and eventually even the year of the reigning [[Caliph]].

==Late Antiquity and Middle Ages==
Most of the traditional calendar eras in use today were introduced at the time of transition from [[Late Antiquity]] to the [[Early Middle Ages]], roughly between the 6th and 10th centuries.

===Christian era===
*The ''[[Etos Kosmou]]'' of the [[Byzantine Calendar]] places Creation at the beginning of its year 1, namely 5509 BC. Its first known use occurred in the 7th century AD, although its precursors were developed about AD 400. The year 7509 of this era began in September 2000.
*The [[Era of Martyrs]] or Era of Diocletian is reckoned from the beginning of the reign of Roman Emperor [[Diocletian]]; the first year of this era was 284/5. It was not the custom to use regnal years in Rome, but it was the custom in Roman Egypt, which the emperor ruled through a prefect (the king of Egypt). The year number changed on the first day of the Egyptian month [[Thoth]] (29 August three years out of four, 30 August the year before a Roman leap year.) Diocletian abolished the special status of Egypt, which thereafter followed the normal Roman calendar: consular years beginning on 1 January. This era was used in the Easter tables prepared in Alexandria long after the abdication of Diocletian, even though Diocletian was a notorious persecutor of Christians. The Era of Diocletian was retained by the [[Coptic calendar|Coptic Church]] and used for general purposes, but by 643 the name had been changed to Era of the Martyrs.&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;{{rp|766–7}}
*The [[Ethiopian calendar|Incarnation Era]] is used by [[Ethiopia]]. Its epoch is August 29, AD 8 in the Julian calendar.
*The [[Armenian calendar]] has its era fixed at AD 552.

====Dionysian "Common Era"====
{{Main|Anno Domini|Common Era}}

The era based on the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] of [[Christ]] was introduced by [[Dionysius Exiguus]] in 525 and is in continued use with various reforms and derivations. The distinction between the Incarnation being the conception or the [[Nativity of Jesus]] was not drawn until the late ninth century.&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;{{rp|881}} The beginning of the numbered year varied from place to place: when, in 1600, Scotland adopted January 1 as the date the year number changes, this was already the case in much of continental Europe. England adopted this practice in 1752.&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;{{rp|7}}

* A.D. (or AD) – for the [[Latin]] ''[[Anno Domini]]'', meaning "in the year of (our) Lord". This is the dominant or Western Christian Era; AD is used in the Gregorian calendar. ''[[Anno Salutis]]'', meaning "in the year of salvation" is identical. Originally intended to number years from the Incarnation of [[Jesus]], according to modern thinking the calculation was a few years off. Years preceding AD 1 are numbered using the BC era, avoiding zero or negative numbers. AD was also used in the medieval [[Julian calendar]], but the first day of the year was either March 1, [[Easter]], March 25, September 1, or December 25, not January 1. To distinguish between the Julian and Gregorian calendars, ''O.S.'' and ''N.S.'' were often added to the date, especially during the 17th and 18th centuries, when both calendars were in common use. [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]] (O.S.) was used for the Julian calendar and for years not beginning on January 1. [[Old Style and New Style dates|New Style]] (N.S.) was used for the Gregorian calendar and for Julian calendar years beginning on January 1. Many countries switched to using January 1 as the start of the numbered year at the same time as they switched from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar, but others switched earlier or later.
* B.C. (or BC) – meaning "Before Christ". Used for years before AD 1, counting backwards so the year ''n'' BC is ''n'' years before AD 1. Thus there is no [[year zero|year 0]].
* C.E. (or CE) and B.C.E. (or BCE)  – meaning "[[Common Era]]" and "Before the Common Era", numerically equivalent to AD and BC, respectively (in writing, "AD" ''precedes'' the year number, but "CE" ''follows'' the year: AD 1 = 1 CE.)&lt;ref&gt;''Associated Press Stylebook''. (2007). New York: Basic Books. p. 6. {{ISBN|978-0-465-00489-8}}. "Because the full phrase would read ''in the year of the Lord 96'', the abbreviation A.D. goes before the figure for the year: ''A.D. 96.''"&lt;/ref&gt; The  Latin equivalent ''vulgaris aera'' was used as early as 1615  by [[Johannes Kepler]].&lt;ref&gt;A 1635 English edition of that book has the title page in English – so far, the earliest-found usage of "Vulgar Era" in English. The English phrase "common Era" appears at least as early as 1708.{{cn|date=May 2018}}
In Latin, "Common Era" is written as ''Vulgaris Aera''. It also occasionally appears as ''æra vulgaris'', ''aera vulgaris'', ''anni vulgaris'', ''vulgaris aera Christiana'', and ''anni vulgatae nostrae aerae Christianas''.&lt;/ref&gt; The English abbreviations C.E. and B.C.E. were introduced in the 19th century  by Jewish intellectuals, wishing to avoid the abbreviation for ''dominus'' "lord" in implicit reference to Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Use of "C.E." and "B.C.E.": [[Morris Jacob Raphall]]. ''Post-Biblical History of The Jews'' (1856). 
Explicit use of "b.c.e." for "before the common era": 
Max Stern, ''Lemaʼan Yilmedu: A Second Hebrew Reader for Jewish Schools and Private Instruction'' (1881), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; By the later 20th century, the abbreviations had come into wider usage by authors who wished to emphasize [[secularism]].&lt;ref&gt; John Sumser, ''The Conflict Between Secular and Religious Narratives in the United States: Wittgenstein, Social Construction, and Communication'' (2016), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=5SFsDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA69   p. 69].&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Dionysian-derived=====
* [[Astronomical year numbering]] equates its year 0 with 1 BC, and counts negative years from 2 BC backward (−1 backward), so 100 BC is −99.
* The [[Holocene calendar|human era]], also named Holocene era, proposed by [[Cesare Emiliani]] adds 10,000 to AD years, so that AD 1 would be the year 10,001.&lt;ref&gt;Cesare, E. (1993). [Correspondence]. ''Nature, 336'', 716.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Anno Lucis]]'' of [[Freemasonry]] adds 4000 years to the AD year.

===Islamic===
*[[Anno Hegirae|A.H.]] (or AH) – for the Latinized ''[[Anno Hegirae]]'', meaning "in the year of the [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]]", [[Muhammad]]'s flight from Mecca to Medina in September 622, which occurred in its first year, used in the [[Islamic calendar]]. Since the Islamic calendar is a purely [[lunar calendar]] of about 354 days, its year count increases faster than that of [[solar calendar|solar]] and [[lunisolar calendar]]s.{{citation needed|date = June 2017}}
*[[A.H.S.]] (or AHS){{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} is used by the [[Iranian calendar]] to denote the number of ''solar'' years since the Hijra. The year beginning at the vernal equinox equals the number of the Gregorian year beginning at the preceding January 1 minus 621.{{citation needed|date = June 2017}}

===Hindu===
*[[Hindu calendar]], counting from the start of the [[Kali Yuga]], with its epoch on February 18, 3102 BC Julian (January 23, 3102 BC Gregorian), based on Aryabhata (6th century).
*[[Vikrama Samvat]], 56-57 BC, introduced about the 12th century.
*[[Saka Era|S.E.]] or (SE) – for the [[Saka|Saka Era]], used in some [[Hindu calendar]]s and in the [[Indian national calendar]], with an epoch near the vernal equinox of year 78 (its year 0); its usage spread to Southeast Asia before year 1000. This era is also used (together with the Gregorian calendar) in the Indian national calendar, the official civil calendar used in communiques issued by the Government of India.

===Southeast Asia===
The Hindu Saka Era influences the calendars of southeast Asian [[Greater India|indianized kingdom]]s.
*[[Buddhist calendar|B.E.]] – for the [[Buddhist calendar|Buddhist Era]], introduced by [[Vajiravudh]] in 1912, which has an [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]] (origin) of 544 BC. This year is called year 1 in [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Burma]], but year 0 in [[Thailand]], [[Laos]] and [[Cambodia]]. Thus the year 2500 B.E. occurred in 1956 in the former countries, but in 1957 in the latter. In Thailand in 1888 King [[Chulalongkorn]] decreed a National Thai Era, dating from the founding of [[Bangkok]] on April 6, 1782. In 1912 New Year's Day was shifted to April 1. In 1941 Prime Minister [[Plaek Pibulsonggram|Phibunsongkhram]] decided to count the years since 543 BC. This is the [[Thai solar calendar]] using the Thai Buddhist Era aligned to the western solar calendar.
*'''BE''' for Burmese Era – from [[Burmese calendar]] originally with an epochal year 0 date of 22 March 638; from which derived '''CS''' for [[Chula Sakarat]] era; variously known as '''LE''' Lesser Era; '''ME''' Minor Era – the Major or Great Era being the [[Saka Era]] of the [[Indian national calendar]]
:B.E. of the Bahá'í calendar is below.

===Bahá'í===
*[[Bahai calendar|B.E.]] – The [[Bahá'í calendar]] dates from the year of the declaration of the [[Báb]]. Years are counted in the Bahá'í Era (BE), which starts its year 1 from March 21, 1844.

===Jewish===
*[[Anno Mundi|A.M.]] (or AM) – for the Latin ''[[Anno Mundi]]'', meaning "in the year of the world", has its epoch in the year 3761 BC. This was first used to number the years of the modern [[Hebrew calendar]] in 1178 by [[Maimonides]]. Precursors with epochs one or two years later were used since the 3rd century, all based on the [[Seder Olam Rabba]] of the 2nd century. The year beginning in the northern autumn of 2000 was 5761 AM).

===Zoroastrian===
*The [[Zoroastrian calendar]] used regnal years since the reform by [[Ardeshir I]], but after the fall of the [[Sassanid empire]], the ascension of the last Sassanid ruler, [[Yazdegerd III of Persia]], crowned June 16, 632, continued to be used as the reference year, abbreviated [[Yazdegerd era|Y.Z.]] or "Yazdegerd era".

==Modern==
{{main|List of calendars}}

===Political===
*The Republican Era of the [[French Republican Calendar]] was dated from September 22, 1792, the day of the proclamation of the [[French First Republic]]. It was used in Revolutionary France from October 24, 1793 (on the Gregorian calendar) to December 31, 1805.
*The [[Positivist calendar]] of 1844 takes 1789 as its epoch.
*The [[Minguo calendar|Republican era]] is used by the [[Republic of China]] since 1912, which is the first year of the republic. Coincidentally, this is the same as the [[Juche#Calendar|Juche era]] used in [[North Korea]], the year of the birth of its founder [[Kim Il-Sung]].
* The [[Era Fascista]] 'Fascist Era' was instituted by the [[Fascism|Italian Fascists]] and used [[Roman numerals]] to denote the number of years since the [[March on Rome]] in 1922. Therefore, 1934, for example, was XII E.F. (''era fascista''). This era was abolished with the fall of fascism in Italy on July 25, 1943, but restored in the northern part of the country during the [[Italian Social Republic]]. The Gregorian calendar remained in simultaneous use and a double numbering was adopted: the year of the [[Common era]] was presented in Arabic numerals and the year of the fascist era in Roman numerals. The year of the Fascist calendar began on October 29, so, for example, October 27, 1933 was XI E.F. but October 30, 1933 was XII E.F.
*China traditionally reckoned by the regnal year of its emperors, see [[Chinese era name]]. Most Chinese do not assign numbers to the years of the [[Chinese calendar]], but the few who do, like expatriate Chinese, use a continuous count of years from the reign of the legendary [[Yellow Emperor]], using 2698 BC as year 1. Western writers begin this count at either 2637 BC or 2697 BC (see [[Chinese calendar#Beginnings|Chinese calendar]]). Thus, the Chinese years 4637, 4697, or 4698 began in early 2000.
*In Korea, from 1952 until 1961 years were numbered via ''[[Dangun#Dating|Dangi]]'' years, where 2333 BC was regarded as the first such year.
*The [[Assyrian calendar]], introduced in the 1950s, has its era fixed at 4750 BC.
*The [[Japanese calendar]] dates from the accession of the current [[Emperor of Japan]]. The current emperor took the throne in early 1989, which became Heisei 1, which was until then Shōwa 64 (for its first seven days).
*The [[United States]] government sometimes uses a calendar of the era of its [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence]], fixed on July 4, 1776, together with the ''Anno Domini'' civil calendar. For instance, its [[U.S. Constitution|Constitution]] is dated "the Seventeenth Day of September in the Year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and Eighty seven and of the Independence of the United States of America the Twelfth."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_transcript.html U.S. Constitution]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Presidential proclamation (United States)|Presidential proclamations]] are also dated in this way.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/ The White House: Presidential Actions]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious===
*[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health#Role in Scientology|A.D.]] – "After [[Dianetics]]". In [[Scientology]], years are numbered relative to the first publication of the book ''[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health]]'' (1950).&lt;ref name="LATcostly"&gt;Sappell, J., &amp; Welkos, R. W. (1990, June 28). [http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-scientology062890,0,6570814.story Costly Strategy Continues to Turn Out Bestsellers]. ''Los Angeles Times.''&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Discordian calendar|Y.O.L.D.]] – In the [[Discordian calendar]], the standard designation for the year number is YOLD (Year of [[Eris (mythology)|Our Lady of Discord]]). The calendar begins counting from January 1, 1166 BC in the [[Discordian]] year 0, ostensibly the date of origin of the [[Greyface|Curse of Greyface]]. An alternate designation, A.D.D. has been occasionally seen (Anno Domina Discordia, a Latin translation of YOLD, but presumably also a play on [[attention deficit disorder]]).
*e.v. – ''Era vulgaris''. (From Latin, meaning "common era", usually stylized in lowercase.) The [[Thelemic]] calendar is used by some Thelemites to designate a number of years since [[Aleister Crowley]]'s inauguration of the so-called [[Aeon_(Thelema)#Aeon_of_Horus|Aeon of Horus]], which occurred on March 20, 1904, and coincides with both the Thelemic new year and a holiday known as the Equinox of the Gods. The abbreviation "A.N.", for ''Aerae Novae'' ("New Era" in Latin), is sometimes also used.

===Practical===
*[[Before Present|B.P.]] – for [[Before Present]], specifically, the number of [[radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon]] years before 1950.
*[[Human Era|HE]] – for counting elapsed years of the [[Holocene]] from near the beginning of the [[Neolithic revolution]] of the [[Holocene epoch]], specifically by adding exactly 10,000 years to AD (Anno Domini) or CE (Common Era) years, and subtracting BC/BCE years from 10001.
*[[Julian day number]] – for counting days, not years, its era fixed at noon January 1, 4713 BC in the [[proleptic Julian calendar]]. This equals November 24, 4714 BC in the [[proleptic Gregorian calendar]]. From noon of this day to noon of the next day was day 0. Multiples of 7 are Mondays. Negative values can also be used. Apart from the choice of the zero point and name, this Julian day and Julian date are not related to the [[Julian calendar]]. It does not count years, so, strictly speaking, it has no era, but it does have an [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]]. Today (noon-to-noon UTC) the value is {{#expr:({{CURRENTJULIANDAY}}-0.5) round 0}}.
* [[Unix time]] – for counting elapsed seconds since the [[Unix epoch]] set at 00:00:00 or midnight UTC of January 1, 1970, though there are problems with Unix implementation of [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC).

The '''Centre for Medieval and Renaissance Studies''' ('''CMRS''') in [[Oxford]], [[England]], is a programme for international students (mainly American) to study in Oxford, and also encourages research in the humanities and fields of medieval and renaissance studies. It was founded by Dr. John and Dr. Sandra J.K.M Feneley in 1975. In 2014, CMRS became part of the global network of Middlebury College C.V. Starr Schools Abroad and is now known as the Middlebury College-CMRS Oxford Humanities Program (M-CMRS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.middlebury.edu/study-abroad/medieval-renaissance-studies|title=United Kingdom {{!}} Middlebury|work=Middlebury|access-date=2017-04-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CMRS has long been affiliated with [[Keble College, Oxford]], and participants are associate members of the College with access to all its facilities. Among the American colleges and universities that have sent students to CMRS are [[The University of Georgia]], [[Elmhurst College]], [[St. Mary's College of California]], [[St. Mary's College of Maryland]], [[St. Olaf College]], [[William Jewell College]], [[Middlebury College]].

CMRS is located in St. Michael's Hall on Shoe Lane, close to [[Carfax, Oxford|Carfax]] at the very center of Oxford. St Michael's Hall is a large building and contains, among other things, a lecture hall, teaching rooms, offices for the M-CMRS  administration, the Feneley Library, and several floors of student accommodation, including a kitchen, dining room, and Junior Common Room.

Ten weeks of each semester coincide with Oxford University's Michaelmas or Hilary Terms.

[[File:Chronique de Frédégaire-deux personnages.jpg|thumb|Pen drawing from the earliest manuscript which is believed to depict [[Eusebius]] and [[Jerome]], 715&amp;nbsp;AD{{sfn|Monod|1885|p=25 fn. 1}}]]

The '''''Chronicle of Fredegar''''' is the conventional title used for a 7th-century [[Franks|Frankish]] chronicle that was probably written in [[Burgundy]]. The author is unknown and the attribution to Fredegar dates only from the 16th century.

The chronicle begins with the creation of the world and ends in AD&amp;nbsp;642. There are also a few references to events up to 658. Some copies of the manuscript contain an abridged version of the chronicle up to the date of 642, but include additional sections written under the [[Carolingian dynasty]] that end with the death of [[Pepin the Short]] in 768. The ''Chronicle of Fredegar'' with its ''Continuations'' is one of the few sources that provide information on the [[Merovingian dynasty]] for the period after 591 when [[Gregory of Tours]]' the ''Decem Libri Historiarum'' finishes.

==Authorship==
None of the surviving manuscripts specify the name of the author.{{sfn|Schwedler|2013|p=73}} The name "Fredegar" (modern French Frédégaire) was first used for the chronicle in 1579 by [[Claude Fauchet (historian)|Claude Fauchet]] in his ''Recueil des antiquitez gauloises et françoises''.{{sfn|Collins|2007|p=16}}{{sfn|Fauchet|1579}} The question of who wrote this work has been much debated, although the historian [[J. M. Wallace-Hadrill]] admits that "Fredegar" is a genuine, if unusual, Frankish name.{{sfn|Wallace-Hadrill|1960|p=xv}} The [[Vulgar Latin]] of this work confirms that the Chronicle was written in Gaul; beyond this, little is certain about the origin of this work. As a result, there are several theories about the authorship:{{sfn|Wallace-Hadrill|1960|pp=xvi&amp;ndash;xxv}}

* The original view, which was stated without argument as late as 1878, was that the Chronicle was written by a single person.
* In 1883 [[Bruno Krusch]], in his edition for the ''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]'', proposed that the Chronicle was the creation of three authors, a theory later accepted by [[Theodor Mommsen]], [[Wilhelm Levison]], and Wallace-Hadrill.
* [[Ferdinand Lot]] critiqued Krusch's theory of multiple authorship and his protests were supported in 1928 by Marcel Bardot and Leon Levillain.
* In 1934, Siegmund Hellmann proposed a modification of Krusch's theory, arguing that the Chronicle was the work of two authors.{{sfn|Hellmann|1934}}
* In 1963, [[Walter Goffart]] renewed the notion of a single author,{{sfn|Goffart|1963}} and this view is now generally accepted.{{sfn|Goffart|2009}}

Fredegar is usually assumed to have been a [[Burgundians|Burgundian]] from the region of [[Avenches]] because of his knowledge of the alternate name Wifflisburg for this locality, a name only then coming into usage. This assumption is supported by the fact that he had access to the annals of many Burgundian churches. He also had access to court documents and could apparently interview [[Lombards|Lombard]], [[Visigoth]], and [[Slavs|Slavic]] ambassadors. His awareness of events in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine world]] is also usually explained by the proximity of Burgundy to Byzantine Italy.

==Manuscripts==
The chronicle exists in over thirty manuscripts, which both Krusch and the English medievalist [[Roger Collins]] group into five classes.{{sfn|Krusch|1882}}{{sfn|Collins|2007}} The original chronicle is lost, but it exists in an [[uncial]] copy made in 715 by a Burgundian monk named Lucerius. This copy, the sole exemplar of a class 1 manuscript, is in the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] (MS Latin 10910) and is sometimes called the ''Codex Claromontanus'' because it was once owned by the [[Collège de Clermont]] in Paris.{{sfn|Goffart|1963|p=209}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Frédégaire. Latin 10910 | url=http://archivesetmanuscrits.bnf.fr/ead.html?id=FRBNFEAD000072579&amp;c=FRBNFEAD000072579_e0000018&amp;qid=sdx_q3 | publisher=Bibliothèque nationale de France | accessdate=24 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Diplomatics#Diplomatic editions and transcription|diplomatic edition]] was prepared by the French historian [[Gabriel Monod]] and published in 1885.{{sfn|Monod|1885}} The ''Codex Claromontanus'' was also the basis of the critical edition by Krusch published in 1888 and of the partial English translation by Wallace-Hadrill published in 1960.{{sfn|Krusch|1888}}{{sfn|Wallace-Hadrill|1960}} Most of the other surviving manuscripts were copied in [[Austrasia]] and date from the early ninth century or later.{{sfn|Wallace-Hadrill|1958|pp=527-528}}

The first printed version, the ''[[editio princeps]]'', was published  in [[Basel]] by [[Matthias Flacius|Flacius Illyricus]] in 1568.{{sfn|Wallace-Hadrill|1958|p=529}} He used MS Heidelberg University Palat. Lat. 864 as his text.{{sfn|Krusch|1888|p=16}} The next published edition was ''Antiquae Lectiones'' by [[Theodorich Canisius|Canisius]] at [[Ingolstadt]] in 1602.

The manuscript was made available on the [[World Digital Library]] on December 20, 2017&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wdl.org/en/item/20005/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
In the critical edition by Krusch the chronicle is divided into four sections or books. The first three books are based on earlier works and cover the period from the beginning of the world up to 584; the fourth book continues up to 642 and foreshadows events occurring between 655 and 660.{{sfn|Goffart|1963|p=206}} In the prologue the author (traditionally Fredegar) writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have most carefully read the chronicles of St Jerome, Hydatius and a certain wise man, of Isidore as well as of Gregory, from the beginning of the world to the declining years of Guntram's reign; and I have reproduced successively in this little book, in suitable languages and without many omissions, what these learned men have recounted at length in their five chronicles.{{sfn|Goffart|1963|p=210}}{{sfn|Krusch|1888|p=[http://www.dmgh.de/de/fs1/object/goToPage/bsb00000749.html?pageNo=123&amp;zoom=1.00 123]}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In fact, Fredegar quotes from sources that he does not acknowledge and drastically condenses some of those he does. He also inserts additional sections of text that are not derived from his main sources. These inserted sections are referred to as "interpolations". For most of them the sources are not known.{{sfn|Goffart|2009}} Some of the interpolations are used to weave a legend of a Trojan origin for the Franks through the chronicle.{{sfn|Wallace-Hadrill|1958|pp=536-539}}{{sfn|Goffart|1963|p=215}}

;Book I
The initial 24 chapters of the first book are based on the anonymous ''Liber generationis'' which in turn is derived from the work of [[Hippolytus (writer)|Hippolytus]]. The remainder of the book contains a compendium of various chronological tables including a list of the Roman Emperors, a list of Judaic kings, a list of popes up to the accession of [[Pope Theodore I|Theodore I]] in 642 and Chapter 3 of the chronicle of [[Isidore of Seville]].{{sfn|Goffart|1963|pp=211-212}} On the reverse of the folio containing the papal list is an ink drawing showing two people which according to Monod probably represent [[Eusebius]] and [[Jerome]].{{sfn|Monod|1885|p=[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k61061331/f35.image 25 fn. 1]}}{{sfn|Goffart|1963|p=211}}

;Book II
The first 49 chapters of the second book contain extracts from Jerome's Latin translation of the [[Chronicon (Eusebius)|Chronicle of Eusebius]]. The text includes some interpolations. The remaining chapters contains extracts from the [[Hydatius#Chronicle|Chronicle of Hydatius]].{{sfn|Goffart|1963|p=210}}{{sfn|Schwedler|2013|p=74}}

;Book III
The third book contains excerpts from Books II–VI of the ''Decem Libri Historiarum'' by [[Gregory of Tours]] with several interpolations. Fredegar's source appears to have lacked the last four books of Gregory's text and his narrative ends in 584.{{sfn|Schwedler|2013|p=74}}

;Book IV
The 90 chapters in the fourth book contain details of events concerning the Burgundian court. Fredegar does not reveal his sources but the earlier chapters are presumably based on local annals. Chapters 24–39 contain an accounts from witnesses of events between 603 and 613.{{sfn|Schwedler|2013|p=74}} Chapter 36 is an interpolation on the life of [[Saint Columbanus]] that is copied, almost without change, from the ''Vita Columbani'' by [[Jonas of Bobbio]].{{sfn|Goffart|1963|p=232}}{{sfn|Krusch|1888|pp=134-138}} The book ends abruptly in 642.{{sfn|Schwedler|2013|p=74}} Book IV has been the most studied by historians as it contains information that is not present in other medieval sources.

==Continuations==
One group of manuscripts (Krusch's Class 4) contain a reworking of the ''Chronicle of Fredegar'' followed by additional sections that describe events in [[Francia]] up to 768. These additional sections are referred to as the ''Continuations''. Krusch in his critical edition, appends these extra chapters to the text of the ''Codex Claromontanus'' creating the false impression that the two parts originate from the same manuscript.{{sfn|Goffart|2009}}{{sfn|Krusch|1888|p=[http://www.dmgh.de/de/fs1/object/goToPage/bsb00000749.html?pageNo=168&amp;zoom=1.00 168]}}

Class 4 manuscripts are divided into three books. The first begins with a section based on the treatise ''De cursu temporum'' by the obscure fourth century Latin writer Quintus Julius Hilarianus. This is followed by a version of Fredegar's Book II incorporating an expanded account of the Trojan origin of the Franks. The second book is an abridged version of the histories by Gregory of Tours corresponding to Fredegar's Book III. The third and final book consists of the 90 chapters of Fredegar's Book IV followed by the ''Continuations''.{{sfn|Goffart|2009}}

The ''Continuations'' consists of three part. The first ten chapters are based on the ''[[Liber Historiae Francorum]]'', an anonymous [[Neustria]]n chronicle that ends in around 721. The second part (Chapters 11&amp;ndash;33) covers the years up to 751. At this point a [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]] is inserted in the text explaining that the writing of the chronicle was ordered by [[Charles Martel]]'s brother, Count [[Childebrand]]. Wallace-Hadrill's  translation is:
 &lt;blockquote&gt;Up to this point, the illustrious Count Childebrand, uncle of the said King Pippin, took great pains to have this history or "geste" of the Franks recorded. What follows is by the authority of the illustrious Count Nibelung, Childebrand's son.{{sfn|Wallace-Hadrill|1958|p=528}}{{efn|The Latin text is: ''Usque nunc inluster vir Childebrandus comes, avunculus praedicto rege Pippino, hanc historiam vel gesta Francorum diligetissime scribere procuravit. Abhinc ab inlustre viro Nibelungo, filium ipsius Childebrando, itemque comite succedat auctoritas.''{{sfn|Krusch|1888|p=[http://www.dmgh.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb00000749_00191.html?zoom=1.00 182]}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The chronicle then continues for another twenty chapters covering events in Francia up to the year 768.{{sfn|Fouracre|2000|p=7}}

The medievalist [[Roger Collins]] has argued that the text in the Class 4 manuscripts is sufficiently different from the ''Fredegar Chronicle'' of the ''Codex Claromontanus'' that it should be considered a separate work. He has proposed the new title ''Historia vel Gesta Francorum'' which occurs in the colophon mentioned above. He has suggested that one author was responsible for the text up 751, and that a different author probably wrote the additional chapters.{{sfn|Collins|2009a}}{{sfn|Collins|2009b}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1376">A '''confraternity book''' or '''liber vitae''' is a [[medieval]] memorial book that records the names of people who have entered into a state of brotherhood with a church in some way, often by visiting it in the capacity of a pilgrim. 

==Confraternity books==
The following is a list of some earlier medieval confraternity books:

* Confraternity book of the [[Abbey of St Gall]]
* Confraternity book of [[Reichenau Abbey]]
* Confraternity book of [[St Peter's Abbey, Salzburg]]
* ''Liber memorialis'' of [[Remiremont Abbey]]
*  ''Liber Vitae'' of the [[Imperial Abbey of Corvey]]
* [[Durham Liber Vitae|''Liber Vitae'']] of Durham

'''Convict assignment''' was the practice used in many [[penal colony|penal colonies]] of assigning [[convicts]] to work for private individuals.  Contemporary abolitionists characterised the practice as virtual [[slavery]], and some, but by no means all, latter-day [[historians]] have agreed with this assessment.

In [[Australia]], every penal colony except [[Western Australia]] had a system of convict assignment.  [[Convict era of Western Australia|Convicts in Western Australia]] were never assigned{{Citation needed|reason=Conflicts with Samuel Speed article|date=May 2018}}, with the debatable exception of the [[Parkhurst apprentices]].

The system was abolished in [[New South Wales]] and [[Van Diemen's Land]] on 1 July 1841 and replaced with the probation gang system.  After working for two years in a labour gang, if they were well-behaved, convicts received 'probation passages' which meant they could work for wages.

'''Demilitarisation''' or '''demilitarization''' may mean the reduction of state armed forces. For instance, the demilitarisation of Northern Ireland entailed the reduction of British security and military apparatuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The State of Loyalism in Northern Ireland|last=Spencer|first=Graham|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2008|isbn=9781349542246|location=New York|pages=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demilitarisation in this sense is usually the result of a peace treaty ending a war or a major conflict. The principle is distinguished from [[demobilization]], which refers to the drastic voluntary reduction in the size of a victorious army. 

== Definitions ==
Demilitarisation was a policy in a number of countries after both world wars. In the [[aftermath of World War I]], the [[United Kingdom]] greatly reduced its military strength, which is also referred to as [[disarmament]]. The resulting position of British military weakness during the rise of the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]] in Germany was among the causes that led to the policy of [[appeasement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lloyd George and the Appeasement of Germany, 1919-1945|last=Rudman|first=Stella|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2011|isbn=9781443826570|location=Newcastle upon Tyne|pages=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conversion of a military or paramilitary force into a civilian one is also called demilitarisation. For example, the Italian [[Polizia di Stato]] demilitarised in 1981, and the [[Austrian Gendarmerie]] merged with the national police, making up a new civilian body. Demilitarisation can also refer to the policies employed by Allied forces during the [[occupation of Japan]] and [[Allied-occupied Germany|Germany]] after [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Haller"&gt;Haller, Oliver, ''[http://archiv.ub.uni-marburg.de/diss/z2007/0126/pdf/doh.pdf Destroying Weapons of Coal, Air and Water: A Critical Evaluation of the American Policy of German Industrial Demilitarization 1945 - 1952]'' (Philipps-Universität Marburg: Marburg, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese and German militaries were re-badged to disassociate them from their recent war history, but were kept active and reinforced to help the allies face the new [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] threat that had become evident as World War 2 ended, and the [[Cold War]] began.

Demilitarisation can also refer to the reduction of one or more types of weapons or weapons systems ''(See [[Arms Control]])'' or the removal of combat equipment from a [[warship]] ''(See [[Japanese battleship Hiei]])''.

A [[demilitarised zone]] is a specific area, such as a buffer zone between nations previously engaged in armed conflict, where military persons, equipment or activities are forbidden. This can also include areas designated during conflicts in which nations, military powers or contending groups forbid military installations, activities or personnel. The demilitarised zone is also free from all activities that assist the war efforts of any of the belligerents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Companion to International Humanitarian Law|last=Djukić|first=Dražan|last2=Pons|first2=Niccolò|publisher=BRILL Nijhoff|year=2018|isbn=9789004342002|location=Leiden|pages=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, this zone is protected from attack and many countries forbid their troops from targeting because it would constitute a grave breach or a serious war crime that would likely warrant the institution of criminal proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Customary International Humanitarian Law|last=Henckaerts|first=Jean-Marie|last2=Doswald-Beck|first2=Louise|last3=Alvermann|first3=Carolin|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005|isbn=9780521839372|location=Cambridge|pages=691}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case, however, of the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|Korean Demilitarised Zone]], of the areas beyond the demilitarized strip that separates both sides, are heavily militarized.

Examples of demilitarisation include:

* The [[Treaty of Versailles]] barred post–World War I Germany from having an air force, armoured vehicles, and certain types of naval vessels. In addition, it established a demilitarised zone in the [[Rhineland]].
* The massive reductions of military personnel in the Allied countries, following World War I.
** The [[Demobilisation of the British Armed Forces after World War II]]
* The [[Washington Naval Treaty]]
* The [[Chemical Weapons Convention]]

==Surat al-Kahf (surah 18), verses 83-101 ==
[[File:Derbent wall.jpg|thumb|200px|The Caspian Gates in [[Derbent]], Russia, part of the defence systems built by the [[Sassanid Persia]]ns, often identified with the Gates of Alexander]]

The story of Dhul-Qarnayn is related in chapter 18 ([[Surat al-Kahf]], "The Cave") of the Quran. This chapter was revealed to Muhammad when his tribe, Quraysh, sent two men to discover whether the Jews, with their superior knowledge of the scriptures, could advise them on whether Muhammad was a true prophet of God. The rabbis told them to ask Muhammad about three things, one of them "about a man who travelled and reached the east and the west of the earth, what was his story". "If he tells you about these things, then he is a prophet, so follow him, but if he does not tell you, then he is a man who is making things up, so deal with him as you see fit." (Verses [[wikisource:The Holy Qur'an! scope="row"|18:83-98]]).

The verses of the chapter reproduced below show Dhul-Qarnayn traveling first to the Western edge of the world where he sees the sun set in a muddy spring, then to the furthest East where he sees it rise from the ocean, and finally northward to a place in the mountains where he finds a people oppressed by Gog and Magog:

==The Alexander Romance and Dhul-Qarnayn==
[[File:Alexander-Coin.jpg|thumb|Silver [[tetradrachm]] of Alexander the Great shown wearing the horns of the ram-god [[Amun|Zeus-Ammon]].]]

The story of Dhul-Qarnayn has its origins in legends of [[Alexander the Great]] current in the Middle East in the early years of the Christian era. According to these legends the [[Scythians]], the descendants of [[Gog and Magog]], once defeated one of Alexander's generals, upon which Alexander built a wall in the [[Caucasus mountains]] to keep them out of civilised lands (the basic elements of the legend are found in [[Flavius Josephus]]). The [[Alexander Romance]] went through much further elaboration in subsequent centuries before eventually finding its way into the Quran through a Syrian version.{{sfn|Bietenholz|1994|p=122-123}}

Alexander was already known as "the two-horned one" in these early legends.{{sfn|Van Donzel|Schmidt|2010|p=57}} The reasons for this are somewhat obscure: the scholar [[al-Tabari]] (839-923 CE) held it was because he went from one extremity ("horn") of the world to the other,{{sfn|Van Donzel|Schmidt|2010|p=57 fn.3}} but it may ultimately derive from the image of Alexander wearing the horns of the ram-god [[Amun|Zeus-Ammon]], as popularised on coins throughout the [[Hellenistic]] Near East.{{sfn|Pinault|1992|p=181 fn.71}} The wall may have reflected a distant knowledge of the [[Great Wall of China]] (the 12th century scholar al-[[Muhammad al-Idrisi|Idrisi]] drew a map for [[Roger of Sicily]] showing the "Land of Gog and Magog" in [[Mongolia]]), or of various [[Sassanid Persia]]n walls built in the [[Caspian area]] against the northern barbarians, or a conflation of the two.{{sfn|Glassé|Smith|2003|p=39}}

Dhul-Qarneyn also journeys to the western and eastern extremities ("qarns", tips) of the Earth.{{sfn|Wheeler|2013|p=96}} In the west he finds the sun setting in a "muddy spring", equivalent to the "poisonous sea" which Alexander found in the Syriac legend. {{sfn|Ernst|2011|p=133}} In the Syriac original Alexander tested the sea by sending condemned prisoners into it, but the Quran changes this into a general administration of justice.{{sfn|Ernst|2011|p=133}} In the east both the Syrian legend and the Quran have Alexander/Dhul-Qarneyn find a people who live so close to the rising sun that they have no protection from its heat.{{sfn|Ernst|2011|p=133}}

"Qarn" also means "period" or "century", and the name Dhul-Qarnayn therefore has a symbolic meaning as "He of the Two Ages", the first being the mythological time when the wall is built and the second the age of the end of the world when Allah's [[shariah]], the divine law, is removed and Gog and Magog are to be set loose.{{sfn|Glassé|Smith|2003|p=38}} Modern Islamic apocalyptic writers, holding to a literal reading, put forward various explanations for the absence of the wall from the modern world, some saying that Gog and Magog were the Mongols and that the wall is now gone, others that both the wall and Gog and Magog are present but invisible.{{sfn|Cook|2005|p=205-206}}

==Dhul Qarnayn in later literature==

Dhul-Qarnayn the traveller was a favourite subject for later writers. In one of many Arabic and [[Persian literature|Persian]] versions of the [[Alexander the Great in legend|meeting of Alexander with the Indian sages]], the poet and philosopher [[Al-Ghazali]] (Abū Ḥāmid Muḥammad ibn Muḥammad al-Ghazālī, 1058–1111) wrote of how Dhul-Qarnayn came across a people who had no possessions but dug graves at the doors of their houses; their king explained that they did this because the only certainty in life is death. Ghazali's version later made its way into the ''[[Thousand and One Nights]]''.{{sfn|Yamanaka|Nishio|2006|p=103-105}}

The [[Sufism|Sufi]] poet [[Rumi]] (Jalāl ad-Dīn Muhammad Rūmī, 1207-1273), perhaps the most famous of medieval Persian poets, described Dhul Qarnayn's eastern journey. The hero ascends [[Mount Qaf|Mount Qof]], the "mother" of all other mountains (identified with the [[Alborz]] mountains on the northern border of [[Iran]]), which is made of emerald and forms a ring encircling the entire Earth with veins under every land. At Dhul Qarnayn's request the mountain explains the origin of [[earthquakes]]: when God wills, the mountain causes one of its veins to throb, and thus an earthquake results. Elsewhere on the great mountain Dhul Qarnayn meets [[Israfil|Esrafil]] (the [[archangel Raphael]]), standing ready to blow the trumpet on the [[Day of Judgement]].{{sfn|Berberian|2014|p=118-119}}

==People identified with Dhul-Qarnayn==

{{also|Cyrus the Great in the Quran}}
Muslim and other commentators have identified Dhul Qarnayn with [[Alexander the Great in the Quran|Alexander the Great]],{{sfn|Netton|2006|p=72-73}} but some have objected that this cannot be so: Alexander lived only a short time, whereas Dhul-Qarnayn lived for 700 years as a sign of God's blessing; Alexander behaved very badly while Dhul-Qarnayn was a paragon; and Dhul-Qarnayn worshiped [[Allah|only one god]], while Alexander worshiped many.{{sfn|Van Donzel|Schmidt|2010|p=57 fn.2}} Other candidates have been suggested:

*[[Cyrus the Great]], the 6th century BCE [[Achaemenid Persia]]n conqueror.
*[[Imru' al-Qays ibn 'Amr|Imru'l-Qays]] (died 328 CE), a prince of the [[Lakhmids]] of southern Mesopotamia, an ally first of Persia and then of Rome, celebrated in romance for his exploits.{{sfn|Ball|2002|p=97-98}}
*"[[Messiah ben Joseph]]", a fabulous military saviour expected by [[Yemenite Jew]]s and associated in folk-lore with [[Dhu Nawas]], a semi-legendary 6th century Yemenite king.{{sfn|Wasserstrom|2014|p=61-62}}

{{Periods in English history}}

The '''Edwardian era''' or '''Edwardian period''' of [[British history]] covers the brief reign of [[King Edward VII]], 1901 to 1910, and is sometimes extended in both directions to capture long-term trends from the 1890s to the [[First World War]]. The death of [[Queen Victoria]] in January 1901 marked the end of the [[Victorian era]]. Her successor, Edward VII, was already the leader of a fashionable elite that set a style influenced by the art and fashions of continental Europe. [[Samuel Hynes]] described the Edwardian era as a "leisurely time when women wore [[picture hat]]s and did not vote, when the rich were not ashamed to live conspicuously, and the sun really never set on the British flag".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/manorhouse/edwardianlife/introduction.html "Manor House" PBS]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Liberals returned to power in [[United Kingdom general election, 1906|1906]] and made [[Liberal welfare reforms|significant reforms]]. Below the upper class, the era was marked by significant shifts in politics among sections of society that had largely been excluded from power, such as common labourers, servants, the industrial working class, and the Irish. Women became increasingly aware of politics.&lt;ref name="Hattersley"&gt;[[Roy Hattersley]], ''The Edwardians'' (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Perceptions ==
The Edwardian period is sometimes portrayed as a romantic golden age of long summer afternoons and garden parties, basking in a sun that never sets on the [[British Empire]]. This perception was created in the 1920s and later by those who remembered the Edwardian age with nostalgia, looking back to their childhoods across the abyss of the [[Great War]].&lt;ref&gt;J. B. Priestley ''The Edwardians'' (1970), pp. 55–56, 288–290.&lt;/ref&gt; The Edwardian age was also seen as a mediocre period of pleasure between the great achievements of the preceding Victorian age and the catastrophe of the following war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Battiscombe |first=Georgina |year=1969 |title=Queen Alexandra |page=217 |location=London |publisher=Constable |isbn=0-09-456560-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent assessments emphasise the great differences between the wealthy and the poor during this period and describe the age as heralding great changes in political and social life.&lt;ref name="Hattersley"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[G. R. Searle]], ''A New England?: peace and war, 1886–1918'' (Oxford UP, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Lawrence James]] has argued that the leaders felt increasingly threatened by rival powers such as Germany, Russia, and the United States.&lt;ref name="James"&gt;{{cite book|last=James|first=Lawrence|authorlink=Lawrence James|title=The Rise and Fall of the British Empire|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|location=|year=1994|isbn=978-0-349-10667-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The sudden arrival of world war in summer 1914 was largely unexpected; only the Royal Navy was prepared for war.

==Politics ==
There was a growing political awareness among the [[working class]], leading to a rise in [[trade unions]], the [[Labour movement]] and demands for better working conditions. The aristocracy remained in control of top government offices.&lt;ref&gt;David Brooks, ''The age of upheaval: Edwardian politics, 1899–1914'' (Manchester University Press, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conservative Party===
{{main|History of the Conservative Party (UK)}}
The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] – at the time called "Unionists" – were the dominant political party from the 1890s until [[1906 UK general election|1906]]. The party had many strengths, appealing to voters supportive of [[imperialism]], tariffs, the [[Church of England]], a powerful [[Royal Navy]], and traditional hierarchical society.  There was a powerful leadership base in the landed aristocracy and landed gentry in rural England, plus strong support from the Church of England and military interests. Historians have used election returns to demonstrate  that Conservatives did surprisingly well in working-class districts.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Lawrence,  "Class and gender in the making of urban Toryism, 1880–1914." ''English Historical Review'' 108.428 (1993): 629–652.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Roberts, "Popular Conservatism in Britain, 1832–1914." ''Parliamentary History'' 26.3 (2007): 387–410.&lt;/ref&gt;  They had an appeal as well to the better-off element of traditional working-class Britons in the larger cities.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Brodie, "Voting in the Victorian and Edwardian East End of London." ''Parliamentary History'' 23.2 (2004): 225–248.&lt;/ref&gt; In rural areas, the national headquarters made highly effective use of paid traveling lecturers, with pamphlets, posters, and especially lantern slides, who were able to communicate effectively with rural voters – particularly the newly enfranchised agricultural workers.&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn Rix, "'Go Out into the Highways and the Hedges': The Diary of Michael Sykes, Conservative Political Lecturer, 1895 and 1907–8." ''Parliamentary History'' 20#2 (2001): 209–231.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the first years of the twentieth century, the Conservative government, with [[Arthur Balfour]] as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], had numerous successes in foreign policy, defence, and education, as well as solutions for the issues of alcohol licensing and land ownership for the peasants of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Blake, ''The Conservative Party: from Peel to Major''(2nd ed. 1985) pp 174–75&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the weaknesses were accumulating, and proved so overwhelming in 1906 that they did not return to complete power until [[1922 UK general election|1922]].&lt;ref&gt;David Dutton, "Unionist Politics and the aftermath of the General Election of 1906: A Reassessment." ''Historical Journal'' 22#4 (1979): 861–876.&lt;/ref&gt; The Conservative Party was losing its drive and enthusiasm, especially after the retirement of the charismatic [[Joseph Chamberlain]]. There was a bitter split on [[Protectionism|"tariff reform"]] (that is, imposing tariffs or taxes on all imports), that drove many of the free traders over to the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] camp. Tariff reform was a losing issue that the Conservative leadership inexplicably clung to.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew S. Thompson, "Tariff reform: an imperial strategy, 1903–1913." ''Historical Journal'' 40#4 (1997): 1033–1054.&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative support weakened among the top tier of the working-class and lower middle-class, and there was dissatisfaction among the intellectuals. The 1906 general election was a landslide victory for the Liberal Party, which saw its total vote share increase by 25%, while the Conservative total vote held steady.&lt;ref&gt;Blake, ''The Conservative Party: from Peel to Major''(1985) pp 175–89&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liberal Party===
{{Main|Liberal Party (UK)}}
The Liberal Party lacked a unified ideological base in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Packer, "The great Liberal landslide: the 1906 General Election in perspective." ''Historian'' 89#1 (2006): 8–16.&lt;/ref&gt; It contained numerous contradictory and hostile factions, such as imperialists and supporters of the Boers;&lt;ref&gt;John W. Auld, "The Liberal Pro-Boers." ''Journal of British Studies'' 14#2 (1975): 78–101.&lt;/ref&gt; near-socialists and laissez-faire classical liberals; suffragettes and opponents of women's suffrage;&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Pugh (author)|Martin Pugh]], ''Votes for women in Britain 1867–1928'' (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; antiwar elements and supporters of the military alliance with France.&lt;ref&gt;Nabil M. Kaylani, "Liberal Politics and British-Foreign-Office 1906-1912-Overview." ''International Review of History and Political Science'' 12.3 (1975): 17–48.&lt;/ref&gt; Non-Conformist Dissenters – Protestants outside the Anglican fold – were a powerful element, dedicated to opposing the established church in terms of education and taxation.  However, the Dissenters were losing support and society at large and played a lesser and lesser role in party affairs after 1900.&lt;ref&gt;John F. Glaser, "English Nonconformity and the Decline of Liberalism," ''American Historical Review'' 63#2 (1958), pp. 352–363 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1849549 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; The Party, furthermore, also included [[Irish Catholics]], and secularists from the labour movement. The middle-class business, professional and intellectual communities were generally strongholds, although some old aristocratic families played important roles as well. The working-class element was moving rapidly toward the newly emerging [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].  One uniting element was widespread agreement on the use of politics and Parliament as a device to upgrade and improve society and to reform politics.&lt;ref&gt;R. C. K. Ensor, ''England 1870–1914'' (1936) pp 384–420.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Dangerfield, ''The Strange Death of Liberal England'' (1935) [https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.175390 online free]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labour Party===
{{Main|History of the Labour Party (UK)}}
The Labour Party was emerging from the rapidly growing trade union movement after 1890. In 1903 it entered the [[Gladstone–MacDonald pact]] with the Liberals, allowing for cross-party support in elections, and the emergence of a small Labour contingent in Parliament. It was a temporary arrangement until the 1920s, when the Labour Party was strong enough to act on its own, and the Liberals were in an irreversible decline. Subtle social changes in the working-class were producing a younger generation that wanted to act independently. Michael Childs argues that the younger generation had reason to prefer Labour over Liberal political styles. Social factors included secularised elementary education (with a disappearing role for Dissenting schools that inculcated Liberal viewpoints); the "New Unionism" after 1890 brought unskilled workers into a movement previously dominated by the skilled workers;&lt;ref&gt;G.R. Searle, ''A new England?: peace and war, 1886–1918'' (2004), pp 185–87.&lt;/ref&gt; and new leisure activities, especially the [[music hall]] and sports, involved youth while repelling the older generation of Liberal voters.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Childs,  "Labour Grows Up: The Electoral System, Political Generations, and British Politics 1890–1929." ''Twentieth Century British History'' 6#2 (1995): 123–144.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boer War===
{{main| Opposition to the Second Boer War }}
The government entered the [[Second Boer War]] with great confidence, little expecting that the two small rural Boer republics in southern Africa with a combined White population less than London would hold off the concentrated power of the [[British Empire]] for two and half years, and take 400,000 Imperial troops to secure victory.&lt;ref&gt;G.R. Searle, ''A new England?: peace and war, 1886–1918'' (Oxford UP, 20040 pp 275–307.&lt;/ref&gt;  The war split the Liberal Party into anti- and pro-war factions. Great orators, such as  Liberal [[David Lloyd George]], who spoke against the war, became increasingly influential. Nevertheless, Liberal Unionist [[Joseph Chamberlain]], who was largely in charge of the war, maintained his hold on power. When [[Herbert Kitchener|General Kitchener]] took command in 1900, he initiated a scorched earth policy in order to foil Boer guerilla tactics. Captured Boer combatants were transported overseas to other British possessions as prisoners of war. However he relocated noncombatant Boers—mostly women and children—into heavily guarded internment camps. The internment camps were overcrowded with bad sanitation and meagre food rations. Contagious diseases such as measles, typhoid and dysentery were endemic. Many of the internees died. [[Emily Hobhouse]] visited the camps and brought the conditions to the attention of the British public. Public outcry resulted in the [[Millicent Fawcett|Fawcett Commission]] which corroborated Hobhouse's report and eventually led to improved conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Jenny De Reuck, "Social suffering and the politics of pain: Observations on the concentration camps in the Anglo-Boer War 1899-1902." ''English in Africa'' (1999) 26#2: 69-88. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40238883 in JSTOR]; [http://journals.co.za/docserver/fulltext/iseaeng/26/2/1174.pdf?expires=1510773095&amp;id=id&amp;accname=guest&amp;checksum=A198A9DA9F3DDEEA1D7943FBE707A8FE another copy]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Boers surrendered and the Boer Republics were annexed by the British  Empire. [[Jan Smuts]]—a leading Boer general—became a senior official of the new government and even became a top British official in the World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chris Wrigley|title=Winston Churchill: A Biographical Companion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HBUslUOGOgkC&amp;pg=PA311|year=2002|page=311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1901, the six British self-governing colonies of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia, and Western Australia united to form the Commonwealth of Australia, with almost complete control of its internal affairs, but with foreign policy and defence handled by London. [[Edmund Barton]] was the first prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Irving, ''To Constitute a Nation: A Cultural History of Australia's Constitution'' (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Liberal reforms===
{{Further|Liberal welfare reforms}}

[[File:Ten Years of Toryism.jpg|thumb|left|Liberal poster c.1905–10]]

The [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] under [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman]] rallied Liberals around the traditional platform of free trade and land reform and led them to [[United Kingdom general election, 1906|the greatest electoral victory]] in Liberal Party history.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Lawrence. "Oxford DNB theme: The general election of 1906" [http://www.oxforddnb.com/public/themes/95/95348.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] was overshadowed by his frontbench, most notably [[H. H. Asquith]] at the Exchequer, [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Edward Grey]] at the Foreign Office, [[Richard Burdon Haldane, 1st Viscount Haldane|Richard Burdon Haldane]] at the War Office and [[David Lloyd George]] at the [[Board of Trade]]. Campbell-Bannerman retired in 1908 and was succeeded by Asquith. He stepped up the government's radicalism, especially in the "[[People's Budget]]" of 1909 that proposed to fund expanded social welfare programmes with new taxes on land and high incomes. It was blocked by the Conservative-dominated [[House of Lords]], but eventually became law in April 1910.

[[File:Asquith Q 42036.jpg|thumb|right|[[H. H. Asquith]]]] 
Almost half of the Liberal MPs elected in 1906 were supportive of the '[[Social liberalism|New Liberalism]]', which advocated government action to improve people's lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rosemary Rees|title=Britain, 1890–1939|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YgtH8GFcFSYC&amp;pg=PA42|year=2003|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Punch cartoon 28 April 1909.jpg|thumb|280px|"Wild Fare". Cartoonist [[John Bernard Partridge]] depicts Lloyd George as a giant with a cudgel labelled "Budget" in reference to his [[People's Budget]]; Asquith cowers beneath the table. ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' 28 April 1909]]

Liberals in 1906–1911 passed major legislation designed to reform politics and society, such as the regulation of working hours, [[National Insurance]] and the beginnings of the welfare state, as well as curtailing the power of the House of Lords.  Women's suffrage was not on the Liberal agenda.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Packer, ''Liberal government and politics, 1905–15'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; There were numerous major reforms helping labour, typified by the  [[Trade Boards Act 1909]] that set minimum wages in certain trades with the history of "sweated" or "sweatshop" rates of especially low wages, because of surplus of available workers, the presence of women workers, or the lack of skills. At first it applied to four industries: chain-making, ready-made tailoring, paper-box making, and the machine-made lace and finishing trade.&lt;ref&gt;Sheila Blackburn, "Ideology and social policy: the origins of the Trade Boards Act." ''The Historical Journal'' 34#1 (1991): 43–64.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was later expanded to coal mining and then to other industries with preponderance of unskilled manual labour by the [[Trade Boards Act 1918]]. Under the leadership of [[David Lloyd George]] Liberals extended minimum wages to farm workers.&lt;ref&gt;Alin Howkins and Nicola Verdon. "The state and the farm worker: the evolution of the minimum wage in agriculture in England and Wales, 1909–24." ''Agricultural history review'' 57.2 (2009): 257–274. [http://www.bahs.org.uk/AGHR/ARTICLES/57_205HowkinsandVerdon.pdf  online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservative peers in the House of Lords tried to stop the [[People's Budget]]. The Liberals passed the [[Parliament Act 1911]] to sharply reduce the power of the [[House of Lords]] to block legislation. The cost was high, however, as the government was required by the king to call two general elections in 1910 to validate its position and ended up frittering away most of its large majority, with the balance of power held by [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] and [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] members.

===Diplomatic ties with France and Russia against Germany===
{{Main|France–United Kingdom relations|Germany–United Kingdom relations}}
Germany's Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] dominated European diplomacy from 1872-1890, with the determination to use the balance of power to keep the peace.  There were no wars.  Bismarck was removed by an aggressive young Kaiser Wilhelm in 1890, effectively decentralizing the Bismarckian Order that had been shrewdly managed and empowering French efforts to isolate Germany. With the formation of the [[Triple Entente]], Germany began to feel encircled: to the West lay France, with whom rivalry was awakening after a generation of dormancy following the Franco-Prussian War, to the East sat Russia, whose rapid industrialization worried leaders across the Continent, and in the seas, British primacy threatened a unified Germany's efforts to develop its ports and maintain its new global empire.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel R. Williamson Jr., "German Perceptions of the Triple Entente after 1911: Their Mounting Apprehensions Reconsidered" ''Foreign Policy Analysis'' 7#2 (2011): 205-214.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Chamberlain]], who played a major role in foreign policy in the late 1890s under the Salisbury government, repeatedly tried to open talks with Germany about some sort of an alliance.  Germany was not interested.&lt;ref&gt;H.W. Koch, "The Anglo‐German Alliance Negotiations: Missed Opportunity or Myth?." ''History'' 54#182 (1969): 378-392.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Paris went to great pains to woo Russia and Great Britain. Key markers were the [[Franco-Russian Alliance]] of 1894, the 1904 [[Entente Cordiale]] linking France and Great Britain, and finally the [[Anglo-Russian Entente]] in 1907 which became the [[Triple Entente]]. France thus had a formal alliance with Russia, and an informal alignment with Britain, against Germany and Austria.&lt;ref&gt;G.P. Gooch, ''Before the war: studies in diplomacy'' (1936), pp 87-186.&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1903 good relations had been established with the United States and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;A.J.P. Taylor, ''The Struggle for Mastery in Europe, 1848–1918'' (1954) pp 345, 403–26&lt;/ref&gt;

Britain abandoned the policy of holding aloof from the continental powers, so called "[[Splendid Isolation]]", in the 1900s after being isolated during the [[Boer War]]. Britain concluded agreements, limited to colonial affairs, with her two major colonial rivals: the [[Entente Cordiale]] with France in 1904 and the [[Anglo-Russian Entente]] of 1907. Britain's alignment a reaction to an assertive German foreign policy and the buildup of its navy from 1898 which led to the [[Anglo-German naval arms race]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Strachan |first=Hew |title=The First World War |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KZHITOPMf4gC&amp;pg=PP1 |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  British diplomat [[Arthur Nicolson, 1st Baron Carnock|Arthur Nicolson]] argued it was "far more disadvantageous to us to have an unfriendly France and Russia than an unfriendly Germany".&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Clark, ''The Sleepwalkers: How Europe Went to War in 1914'' (2014) p. 324&lt;/ref&gt;  The impact of the Triple Entente was to improve British relations with France and its ally Russia and to demote the importance to Britain of good relations with Germany.   After 1905, foreign policy was tightly controlled by the Liberal Foreign Secretary [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Edward Grey]] (1862-1933), who seldom consulted with his party leadership.  Grey shared the strong Liberal policy against all wars and against military alliances that would force Britain to take a side in war. However, in the case of the Boer War, Grey held that the Boers had committed  an aggression that it was necessary to repulse. The Liberal party split on the issue, with a large faction strongly opposed to the war in Africa &lt;ref&gt;Keith Robbins, "Grey, Edward, Viscount Grey of Fallodon (1862–1933)", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography,'' (2004; online edition, 2011) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/33570, accessed 5 Nov 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

The  Triple Entente between Britain, France and Russia is often compared to the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] between Germany, Austria–Hungary and Italy, but historians caution against the comparison. The Entente, in contrast to the Triple Alliance or the [[Franco-Russian Alliance]], was not an alliance of mutual defence and Britain therefore felt free to make her own foreign policy decisions in 1914. The Liberals were highly moralistic, and by 1914 they have been increasingly convinced that German aggression violated international norms, and specifically that its invasion of neutral Belgium was completely unacceptable in terms of morality, Britain and Germany's obligations under the [[Treaty of London (1839)|Treaty of London]], and in terms of British policy against any one power controlling the continent of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;K.A. Hamilton, "Great Britain and France, 1911-1914" in F. H. Hinsley, ed., ''British Foreign Policy Under Sir Edward Grey'' (1977) [https://books.google.com/books?id=VJ08AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA324  online p 324]&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the last few weeks before it started in August 1914, almost no one saw a world war coming.  The expectation among the generals was that because of industrial advances any future war would produce a quick victory for the side that was better-prepared, better armed, and faster to move. No one saw that the innovations of recent decades—high explosives, long-range artillery and machine guns—were defensive weapons that practically guaranteed defeat of massed infantry attacks with very high casualties.&lt;ref&gt;Gerd Krumeich, "The War Imagined: 1890–1914." in John Horne, ed. ''A Companion to World War I'' (2012) pp 1-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Naval race with Germany===
{{Main|Anglo-German naval arms race}}
[[File:HMS Dreadnought 1906 H61017.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The British ''Dreadnought'' (1906) made all battleships obsolete because it had ten long-range 12-inch big guns, mechanical computer-like range finders, high speed turbine engines that could make 21 knots, and armour plates 11 inches thick.]]
After 1805 the dominance of Britain's Royal Navy was unchallenged;  in the 1890s Germany decided to match it. Grand Admiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz]] (1849 – 1930) dominated German naval policy from 1897 until 1916.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Epkenhans]], ''Tirpitz: Architect of the German High Seas Fleet'' (2008) [https://www.amazon.com/dp/1574887327/ excerpt and text search], pp 23-62&lt;/ref&gt; Before the Germany Empire formed in 1871, Prussia never had a real navy, nor did the other German states.  Tirpitz turned the modest little fleet into a world-class force that could threaten the British Royal Navy. The British responded with new technology typified by the [[HMS Dreadnought (1906)|Dreadnought revolution]]. It made every battleship obsolete and, supplemented by the global network of coaling stations and telegraph cables, enabled Britain to stay well in the lead in naval affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Macmillan, ''The War That Ended Peace: The Road to 1914'' (2013) ch 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hoerber,  "Prevail or perish: Anglo-German naval competition at the beginning of the twentieth century," ''European Security'' (2011) 20#1, pp. 65–79. [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09662839.2010.547190 abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from a determination to retain a strong naval advantage, the British lacked a military strategy or plans for a major war.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew S. Seligmann, "Failing to Prepare for the Great War? The Absence of Grand Strategy in British War Planning before 1914" ''War in History'' (2017) 24#4 414-37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
The Edwardian era stands out as a time of peace and prosperity. There were no severe depressions, and prosperity was widespread. Britain's growth rate, manufacturing output and [[GDP]] (but not GDP per capita) fell behind its rivals, the United States and Germany, but the nation still led the world in trade, finance and shipping, and had strong bases in manufacturing and mining.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Dormois and Michael Dintenfass, eds., ''The British Industrial Decline'' (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; The industrial sector was slow to adjust to global changes, and there was a striking preference for leisure over entrepreneurship among the elite. However, major achievements should be underlined. [[London]] was the financial centre of the world—far more efficient and wide-ranging than New York, Paris or Berlin. Britain had built up a vast reserve of overseas credits in its formal Empire, as well as in its informal empire in Latin America and other nations. It had huge financial holdings in the United States, especially in railways. These assets proved vital in paying for supplies in the first years of the World War. The amenities, especially in urban life, were accumulating—prosperity was highly visible. The working classes were beginning to protest politically for a greater voice in government, but the level of industrial unrest on economic issues was not high until about 1908.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur J Taylor, "The Economy", in Simon Nowell-Smith, ed., ''Edwardian England: 1901–1914'' (1964) pp. 105–138&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social change and improved health==
By the late-1880s, the [[Industrial Revolution]] had created new technologies that changed the way people lived. The growth of industry shifts in manufacturing factories, special-purpose machinery and technological innovations, which led to increased productivity. [[Gender roles]] shifted as women made use of the new technology to upgrade their lifestyle and their career opportunities.

Mortality declined steadily in urban England and Wales 1870–1917. Robert Millward and Frances N. Bell looked statistically at those factors in the physical environment (especially population density and overcrowding) that raised death rates directly, as well as indirect factors such as price and income movements that affected expenditures on sewers, water supplies, food, and medical staff. The statistical data show that increases in the incomes of households and increases in town tax revenues helped cause the decline of mortality. The new money permitted higher spending on food, and also on a wide range of health-enhancing goods and services such as medical care. The major improvement in the physical environment was the quality of the housing stock, which rose faster than the population; its quality was increasingly regulated by central and local government.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Millward and Frances N. Bell, "Economic factors in the decline of mortality in late nineteenth century Britain," ''European Review of Economic History'' 2#3 (1998) pp. 263–288 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/41377834 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Infant mortality]] fell faster in England and Wales than in Scotland. Clive Lee argues that one factor was the continued overcrowding in Scotland's housing.&lt;ref&gt;Clive H. Lee, "Regional inequalities in infant mortality in Britain, 1861–1971: patterns and hypotheses." ''Population Studies'' 45.1 (1991): 55–65.&lt;/ref&gt;  During the First World War, infant mortality fell sharply across the country. J.M. Winter attributes this to the full employment and higher wages paid to war workers.&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Winter,  "Aspects of the impact of the First World War on infant mortality in Britain." ''Journal of European Economic History'' 11.3 (1982): 713.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rising status of women===
For housewives, sewing machines enabled the production of ready made clothing and made it easier for women to sew their own clothes; more generally, argues Barbara Burman, "home dressmaking was sustained as an important aid for women negotiating wider social shifts and tensions in their lives."&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Burman, "Made at Home by Clever Fingers: Home Dressmaking in Edwardian England," in Barbara Burman, ed. ''The Culture of Sewing: Gender, Consumption, and Home Dressmaking'' (1999) p 34&lt;/ref&gt;  Increased literacy in the [[middle-class]] gave women wider access to information and ideas. Numerous new magazines appealed to her tastes and help define femininity.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Beetham, ''A magazine of her own?: domesticity and desire in the woman's magazine, 1800–1914'' (Routledge, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

The inventions of the typewriter, telephone, and new filing systems offered middle-class women increased employment opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;Guerriero R. Wilson, "Women's work in offices and the preservation of men's 'breadwinning'jobs in early twentieth-century Glasgow." ''Women's History Review'' 10#3 (2001): 463–482.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Anderson, ''The white-blouse revolution: female office workers since 1870'' (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;  So too did the rapid expansion of the school system,&lt;ref&gt;Carol Dyhouse, ''Girls growing up in late-Victorian and Edwardian England'' (Routledge, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; and the emergence of the new profession of nursing.  Education and status led to demands for female roles in the rapidly expanding world of sports.&lt;ref&gt;Cartriona M. Parratt, "Athletic 'Womanhood': Exploring sources for female sport in Victorian and Edwardian England." ''Journal of Sport History'' 16#2 (1989): 140–157.&lt;/ref&gt;

Women were very active in church affairs, including attendance at services, Sunday school teaching, fund raising, pastoral care, social work and support for international missionary activities.  They quietly submitted to their almost complete exclusion from practically all leadership roles.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Ottewill, "'Skilful and Industrious': Women and Congregationalism in Edwardian Hampshire 1901–1914." ''Family &amp; Community History'' 19#1 (2016): 50-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Women's suffrage====
{{Main|Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom}}
As middle-class women rose in status they increasingly supported demands for a political voice.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Pugh, ''Women's suffrage in Britain, 1867–1928'' (1980).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[June Purvis]], "Gendering the Historiography of the Suffragette Movement in Edwardian Britain: some reflections." ''[[Women's History Review]]'' 22#4 (2013): 576-590.&lt;/ref&gt;  There was significant support for woman suffrage in all the parties, but the Liberal Party was in control after 1906 and a handful of its leaders, especially [[H. H. Asquith]], blocked it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Roberts|title=Britain, 1846-1964: The Challenge of Change|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gwc0Rlq8al4C&amp;pg=RA1-PT80|year=2001|publisher=Oxford UP|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were numerous organisations which did their work quietly.  After 1897 they were increasingly linked together by the [[National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies]] (NUWSS) led by [[Millicent Fawcett]].  However front page publicity was seized by the [[Women's Social and Political Union]] (WSPU). Founded in 1903, it was tightly controlled by the three Pankhursts, [[Emmeline Pankhurst]] (1858–1928), and her daughters [[Christabel Pankhurst]] (1880–1958) and [[Sylvia Pankhurst]] (1882–1960).&lt;ref&gt;Jane Marcus, ''Suffrage and the Pankhursts'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;  It specialized in highly visible publicity campaigns such as large parades. This had the effect of energizing all dimensions of the suffrage movement. While there was a majority of support for suffrage in parliament, the ruling Liberal Party refused to allow a vote on the issue; the result of which was an escalation in the suffragette campaign. The WSPU, in dramatic contrast to its allies, embarked on a campaign of violence to publicize the issue, even to the detriment of its own aims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://historicengland.org.uk/research/inclusive-heritage/womens-history/suffrage/|title=The Struggle for Suffrage {{!}} Historic England|last=England|first=Historic|website=historicengland.org.uk|access-date=2017-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Melanie Phillips, ''The Ascent of Woman: A History of the Suffragette Movement and the Ideas behind it'' (Abacus, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Birth control====
Although abortion was illegal, it was nevertheless the most widespread form of birth control in use.&lt;ref name="knight"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Knight|first=Patricia|title=Women and Abortion in Victorian and Edwardian England|journal=History Workshop|year=1977|volume=4|pages=57–68|doi=10.1093/hwj/4.1.57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Used predominantly by [[working-class]] women, the procedure was used not only as a means of terminating pregnancy, but also to prevent poverty and unemployment. Those who transported [[contraceptive]]s could be legally punished.  Contraceptives became more expensive over time and had a high failure rate. Unlike contraceptives, abortion did not need any prior planning and was less expensive. Newspaper advertisements were used to promote and sell [[abortifacient]]s indirectly.&lt;ref name="mclaren"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McLaren|first=Angus|title=Abortion in England 1890–1914|journal=Victorian Studies|year=1977|pages=379–400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all of society was accepting of contraceptives or abortion, and the opposition viewed both as part of one and the same sin. Abortion was much more common among the middle-classes than among those living in rural areas, where the procedure was not readily available. Women were often tricked into purchasing ineffective pills. In addition to fearing legal reprimands, many physicians did not condone abortion because they viewed it as an immoral procedure potentially endangering a woman's life.&lt;ref name="mclaren" /&gt; Because abortion was illegal and physicians refused to perform the procedure, local women acted as abortionists, often using crochet hooks or similar instruments.&lt;ref name="knight" /&gt;

Feminists of the era focused on educating and finding jobs for women, leaving aside the controversial issues of contraceptives and abortion, which in popular opinion were often related to promiscuity and prostitution. The Church condemned abortion as immoral and a form of rebellion against the child-bearing role women were expected to assume. Many considered abortion to be a selfish act that allowed a woman to avoid personal responsibility, contributing to a decline in moral values.&lt;ref name="knight" /&gt; Abortion was often a solution for women who already had children and did not want more. Consequently, the size of families decreased drastically.&lt;ref name="mclaren" /&gt;

====Poverty among working-class women====
The [[1834 Poor Law]] defined who could receive monetary relief. The act reflected and perpetuated prevailing gender conditions. In Edwardian society, men were the source of wealth. The law restricted relief for unemployed, able-bodied male workers, due to the prevailing view that they would find work in the absence of financial assistance. However, women were treated differently. After the Poor Law was passed, women and children received most of the aid. The law did not recognise single independent women, and lumped women and children into the same category.  If a man was physically disabled, his wife was also treated as disabled under the law. Unmarried mothers were sent to the workhouse, receiving unfair social treatment such as being restricted from attending church on Sundays.  During marriage disputes women often lost the rights to their children, even if their husbands were abusive.&lt;ref name=thane&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thane|first=Pat|authorlink = Pat Thane|title=Women and the Poor Law in Victorian and Edwardian England|journal=History Workshop|year=1978|pages=29–51|doi=10.1093/hwj/6.1.29|jstor=4288190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, single mothers were the poorest sector in society, disadvantaged for at least four reasons. First, women lived longer, often leaving them widowed with children. Second, women had fewer opportunities to work, and when they did find it, their wages were lower than male workers' wages. Thirdly, women were often less likely to marry or remarry after being widowed, leaving them as the main providers for the remaining family members. Finally, poor women had deficient diets, because their husbands and children received disproportionately large shares of food. Many women were malnourished and had limited access to health care.&lt;ref name=thane/&gt;

====Female servants====
Edwardian Britain had large numbers of male and female [[domestic servant]]s, in both urban and rural areas.&lt;ref name=benson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Benson|first=John|title=One Man and His Woman: Domestic Service in Edwardian England|journal=Labour History Review|year=2007|volume=72|issue=3|pages=203–214}}&lt;/ref&gt; Middle and upper-class women relied on servants to run their homes smoothly. Servants were provided with food, clothing, housing, and a small wage, and lived in a self-enclosed social system inside the mansion.&lt;ref name=davidoff&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davidoff|first=Lenore|title=Mastered for Life: Servant and Wife in Victorian and Edwardian England|journal=Society for the Study of Labour History|year=1973|volume=73|issue=27|pages=23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of domestic servants fell in the Edwardian era due to a declining number of young people willing to be employed in this area.&lt;ref name=pooley&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pooley|first=Sian|title=Domestic Servants and Their Urban Employers: A Case Study of Lancaster 1880–1914|journal=The Economic History Review|year=2008|volume=62|issue=2|pages=405–429|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0289.2008.00459.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fashion===
{{main|1900s in fashion}}
[[File:Women dress-1901-1911-Punch.jpg|thumb|300px|A cartoon in ''Punch'' (1911) compares changes in fashion between 1901 and 1911. "The dowdy voluminous clothes of the earlier date, making the grandmother an old lady and the mother seem plain, had been replaced by much simpler looser wear producing a sense of release for all three females."&lt;ref&gt;Donald Read, ''Edwardian England 1901-15: society and politics'' (1972) pp 257-58.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The upper-classes embraced leisure sports, which resulted in rapid developments in fashion, as more mobile and flexible clothing styles were needed.&lt;ref&gt;Marilyn Constanzo, "'One Can't Shake Off the Women': Images of Sport and Gender in Punch, 1901–10." ''The International journal of the history of sport'' 19#1 (2002): 31–56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Cosbey, Mary Lynn Damhorst, and Jane Farrell-Beck. "Diversity of daytime clothing styles as a reflection of women's social role ambivalence from 1873 through 1912." ''Clothing and Textiles Research Journal'' 21#3 (2003): 101–119.&lt;/ref&gt;  During the Edwardian era, women wore a very tight [[corset]], or [[bodice]], and dressed in long skirts. The Edwardian era was the last time women wore corsets in everyday life. According to [[Arthur Marwick]], the most striking change of all the developments that occurred during the Great War was the modification in women's dress, "for, however far politicians were to put the clocks back in other steeples in the years after the war, no one ever put the lost inches back on the hems of women's skirts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Arthur |last=Marwick |title=The Deluge.

The 'Tea Gown' was one of the Fashion creations during the Edwardian era and when women starting to stop wearing corsets. More Afternoon and Tea parties were being held and for longer amongst the upper classes, thus the trend of the 'Tea Gown' was created. The Tea Gown was worn to receive guests. The fabric choices are usually sweet pea shades in chiffon, mousse line de sore, tulle with feather boas and lace. Lace was a ‘must-have’ in the Edwardian wardrobe. It represents femininity and wealth. ‘High and boned collars for the day; plugging off shoulder décolleté for the evening’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/740627215|title=Fashion : a visual history from regency &amp; romance to retro &amp; revolution : a complete illustrated chronology of fashion from the 1800s to the present day|last=J.|first=Stevenson, N.|date=2012|origyear=2011|publisher=St. Martin's Griffin|isbn=9780312624453|edition= 1st U.S. |location=New York|oclc=740627215}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tea Gown's cuttings are relatively loose comparing to the evening gown's. The flow is quite feminine, usually decorated with lace. In which, Irish crochet was the more affordable alternative.

Parasols are different than umbrellas. The parasols that were widely use during the Edwardian era are not waterproof, they are made of fabric. It was not designed for functionality, but as a Fashion ornament. Over time, decorative ornaments became heavier, i.e. the hats, sleeves and hem. By the end of the Edwardian era, the hat is bigger in size, with more decorations like feathers and one or more plumes on top.

The Edwardians developed new styles in clothing design.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Victorian and Edwardian Fashions from "La Mode Illustrée"|last=Olian|first=JoAnne|publisher=Dover Publications|year=1998|isbn=9780486297118|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Victorian Era is associated with large, ankle-length, heavy, dark velvet gowns and bustles for the classes that could afford them, the Edwardian era favored more tightly fitting skirts and dresses made of lightweight fabrics designed for a more active lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Beth Presley, "Fifty years of change: Societal attitudes and women's fashions, 1900–1950."

* The 2 pieces dress came into vogue. Skirts hung tight at the hips and flared at the hem, creating a trumpet of lily-like shape.
* Skirts in 1901 had decorated hems with ruffles of fabric and lace.

* By 1904, skirts became fuller and less clingy.
* In 1905, skirts fell in soft folds that curved in, then flared out near the hemlines.
* From 1905 – 1907, waistlines rose.
* In 1901, the [[hobble skirt]] was introduced; a tight fitting skirt that restricted a woman's stride.

* Around 1913 women's dresses acquired a lower and sometimes V-shaped neckline in opposition to the high collars a generation before.

===Newspapers===
The turn of the century saw the rise of popular journalism aimed at the lower middle class and tending to deemphasise highly detailed political and international news, which remain the focus of a handful of low-circulation prestige newspapers. They were family-owned and operated, and were primarily interested not in profits but in influence on the nation's elite by their control of the news and editorials on serious topics.  The new press they reached vastly larger audiences by emphasis on sports, crime, sensationalism, and gossip about famous personalities. Detailed accounts of major speeches and complex international events were not printed. [[Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe]] was the chief innovator.&lt;ref&gt;R.C.K. Ensor, England, 1870-1914 (1936) pp 309-16.&lt;/ref&gt;  He used his ''[[Daily Mail]]'' and ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' to transform the media along the American model of "[[Yellow Journalism]]".  [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]] said he was "the greatest figure who ever strode down Fleet Street".&lt;ref&gt;Lord Beaverbrook, ''Politicians and the War, 1914–1916'' (1928) 1:93.&lt;/ref&gt;  Harmsworth made a great deal of money, but during the [[First World War]] he also wanted political power.  For that he purchased the highest prestige newspaper, ''[[The Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;J. Lee Thompson, "Fleet Street Colossus: The Rise and Fall of Northcliffe, 1896–1922."

==The arts==
[[File:Peter Pan (2733740964).jpg|thumb|[[Peter Pan statue]], [[Kensington Gardens]]]]
The Edwardian era corresponds to the French ''[[Belle Époque]]''. Despite its brief pre-eminence, the period is characterised by its own unique architectural style, fashion, and lifestyle. [[Art Nouveau]] had a particularly strong influence. Artists were influenced by the development of the automobile and electricity, and a greater awareness of human rights.

In November 1910, [[Roger Fry]] organised the exhibition ''Manet and the Post-Impressionists'' at the [[Grafton Galleries]], London. This exhibition was the first to prominently feature [[Gauguin]], [[Manet]], [[Matisse]], and [[Van Gogh]] in England and brought their art to the public. He followed it up with the ''Second Post-Impressionist Exhibition'' in 1912.

[[George Frampton]]'s [[statue of Peter Pan]], "erected in Hyde Park in 1912 ... immediately became a source of contention, sparking debate about the role of public statuary and its role in spaces of recreation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/1121 Linkof, Ryan. review of ''The Edwardian Sense: Art, Design, and Performance in Britain, 1901–1910'', (review no. 1121), Institute of Historical Research]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
In fiction, some of the best-known names are [[J. M. Barrie]], [[Arnold Bennett]], [[G. K. Chesterton]], [[Joseph Conrad]], [[E. M. Forster]], [[John Galsworthy]], [[Kenneth Grahame]], [[M. R. James]], [[Rudyard Kipling]], [[James Joyce]], [[A.A. Milne]], [[D. H. Lawrence]], [[Edith Nesbit]], [[Beatrix Potter]], [[Saki]], [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[H. G. Wells]],  and [[P. G. Wodehouse]]. Apart from these famous writers, this was a period when a great number of novels and short stories were being published, and a significant distinction between "[[highbrow]]" literature and [[popular fiction]] emerged. Among the most famous works of literary criticism was [[A. C. Bradley]]'s ''Shakespearean Tragedy'' (1904).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Priestley |first=J. B. |authorlink = J. B. Priestley|year=1970 |title=The Edwardians |pages=176–178 |location=London |publisher=Heinemann |isbn=0-434-60332-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
Live performances, both amateur and professional, were popular. [[Henry Wood]], [[Edward Elgar]], [[Gustav Holst]], [[Arnold Bax]], [[George Butterworth]], [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], and [[Thomas Beecham]] were all active. Military and brass bands often played outside in parks during the summer.&lt;ref&gt;J. B. Priestley ''The Edwardians'' (1970), pp. 132–139.&lt;/ref&gt;  The new technology of [[wax cylinders]] played on [[phonograph]]s, made live performances permanently available for repetition at any time.

===Performing arts===
Cinema was primitive and audiences preferred live performances to picture shows. [[Music hall]] was very popular and widespread; influential performers included male impersonator [[Vesta Tilley]] and comic [[Little Tich]].&lt;ref&gt;J. B. Priestley ''The Edwardians'' (1970), pp. 172–176.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most successful playwright of the era was [[W. Somerset Maugham]]. In 1908, he had four plays running simultaneously in London, and ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' published a cartoon of Shakespeare biting his fingernails nervously as he looked at the billboards. Maugham's plays, like his novels, usually had a conventional plot structure, but the decade also saw the rise of the so-called New Drama, represented in plays by [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[Harley Granville Barker]], and Continental imports by [[Henrik Ibsen]] and [[Gerhardt Hauptmann]]. The actor/manager system, as managed by [[Sir Henry Irving]], [[George Alexander (actor)|Sir George Alexander]], and [[Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree]], was in decline.

===Architecture===
{{see also|Edwardian architecture}}
Notable architects included [[Edwin Lutyens]], [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]], and [[Giles Gilbert Scott]]. In spite of the popularity of [[Art Nouveau]] in Europe, the [[Edwardian Baroque architecture|Edwardian Baroque]] style of architecture was widely favoured for public structures and was a revival of [[Christopher Wren]]–inspired designs of the late 17th and early 18th centuries. The change or reversal in taste from the Victorian eclectic styles corresponded with the historical revivals of the period, most prominently earlier [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] and [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] styles of the late 18th and early 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;A.S. Gray, ''Edwardian Architecture: A Biographical Dictionary'' (1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[White City Stadium]] for the [[1908 Summer Olympics]] was the first Olympic Stadium in the UK. Built on the site of the [[Franco-British Exhibition]], it had a seating capacity of 68,000 was opened by King Edward VII on 27 April 1908. It was the largest structure of its type in the world, and was designed to be  awesome and enhance the love of large-scale spectacle that characterised Edwardian London.&lt;ref&gt;David Littlefield,  "White City: The Art of Erasure and Forgetting the Olympic Games." ''Architectural Design'' 82#1 (2012): 70–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
Filmmakers [[Mitchell and Kenyon]] documented many scenes from Britain and Ireland from 1900–1907, sports, parades, factory exits, parks, city streets, boating and the like. Their films have survived in very good quality restored from the original negatives.&lt;ref&gt;Vanessa Toulmin and Simon Popple, eds., ''The Lost World of Mitchell and Kenyon: Edwardian Britain on Film'' (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see for example [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNVthr44XqU "The Lost World Of Mitchell And Kenyon – Episode 1 – 4/6"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science and technology==
The period featured many innovations. [[Ernest Rutherford]] published his studies on [[radioactivity]]. The first transatlantic wireless signals were sent by [[Guglielmo Marconi]], and the [[Wright brothers]] flew for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;A. R. Ubbelohde, "Edwardian Science and Technology: Their Interactions", ''British Journal for the History of Science'' (1963) 1#3 pp. 217–226 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4024921 in JSTOR]
&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the era, [[Louis Blériot]] had crossed the [[English Channel]] by air; the largest ship in the world, [[RMS Olympic|RMS ''Olympic'']], had sailed on its maiden voyage and her larger sister [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] was under construction; automobiles were common; and the [[South Pole]] was reached for the first time by [[Roald Amundsen]]'s and then [[Robert Falcon Scott]]'s teams.

==Sport==
[[File:London 1908 Steeplechasea.jpg|thumb|right|200px|1908 Summer Olympics in London: The water jump in the [[Steeplechase (athletics)|steeplechase]]]]
The [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908 Summer Olympic Games]] were held in London. Popularity of sports tended to conform to class divisions, with tennis and yachting popular among the very wealthy and [[Association football|football]] favoured by the working class.&lt;ref&gt;James Anthony Mangan, ed. ''A sport-loving society: Victorian and Edwardian middle-class England at play'' (Routledge, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Football ===
[[Aston Villa]] maintained their position as the pre-eminent football team of the era, winning the [[FA Cup]] for the fourth time in 1904–05 and their sixth League title in 1909–10. The club colours of claret and sky blue were adopted by [[Burnley FC|Burnley]] as a tribute to their success in 1910. Sunderland achieved their fourth league title in 1901–02. The era also saw [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] (1900–01, 1905–06), [[Newcastle United]] (1904–05, 1906–07, 1908–09) and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] (1907–08) winning their first league titles.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Mason, "'Our Stephen and our Harold': Edwardian footballers as local heroes." ''The International Journal of the History of Sport'' 13#1 (1996): 71–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European Heritage Label''' is a recognition awarded by the [[European Union]] to buildings, documents, museums, archives, monuments or events which are seen as milestones in the creation of today's Europe. The program is managed by the [[European Commission]].

==History==

===Intergovernmental initiative===
[[File:Patrimoineeuropeen.png|thumb|Logo for the former intergovernmental scheme]]
The European Heritage Label started as an intergovernmental initiative between 17 individual EU member states during a meeting in [[Granada]], [[Spain]] on 28 April 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thenewfederalist.eu/The-New-European-Heritage-Label-is-Here,05718 | publisher=The New Federalist | title=The New European Heritage Label is Here! | first=Ferghane | last=Azihari | date=27 April 2013 | accessdate=23 April 2016 | archiveurl= | archivedate=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motivations for creating the initiative included the 2005 referenda in France and the Netherlands, which resulted in the two countries not ratifying a constitution for Europe. The initiative's main aim was to identify and designate sites which have played a key role in building a united Europe and to see those sites through a European, rather than national, viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.academia.edu/17343457/Transnational_Heritage_in_the_Making._Strategies_for_Narrating_Cultural_Heritage_as_European_in_the_Intergovernmental_Initiative_of_the_European_Heritage_Label._Ethnologica_Europaea_44_1_75_93_2014._Final_Draft_]"&lt;/ref&gt;

The intergovernmental initiative connected both EU member states and non-member states such as Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://euobserver.com/news/29647]"&lt;/ref&gt; The participating countries’ heritage agencies awarded the Label to sites with cross-border or pan-European character.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32011D1194&amp;from=EN]"&lt;/ref&gt; The countries chose their own cultural assets, whether physical sites or more abstract traditions, meaning that the criteria for the Label varied per country. By 2010, 64 sites in 18 different participating countries had been awarded the intergovernmental label.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-10-250_en.htm]"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transformation into an EU initiative ===

On 20 November 2008, the Council adopted conclusions aimed at transforming the intergovernmental initiative into a Union action by inviting the Commission to submit to it a proposal for the creation by the Union of a European Heritage Label and to specify the practical procedures for the implementation of the project.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32011D1194&amp;from=EN]"&lt;/ref&gt; Public hearings and impact assessments were carried out, confirming the added value of EU involvement. In 2010, the European Commission announced the plans for the EU-wide scheme known as the European Heritage Label&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-15755426]"&lt;/ref&gt; and it was officially established on 16 November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32011D1194&amp;from=EN]"&lt;/ref&gt;

==European Heritage Label from 2013==

Under the new Label, the first four sites were designated in 2013, with sixteen more designations following in 2014.

Candidate sites for the label must have a symbolic European value and must have played a significant role in the history and culture of Europe and/or the building of the Union. They must therefore demonstrate one or more of the following:

# their cross-border or pan-European nature: how their past and present influence and attraction go beyond the national borders of a Member State;
# their place and role in European history and European integration, and their links with key European events, personalities or movements;
# their place and role in the development and promotion of the common values that underpin European integration.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32011D1194&amp;from=EN]"&lt;/ref&gt;

During the pre-selection stage, EU countries may choose up to two sites biennially, following which, at selection stage, a panel of 13 independent experts select and monitor the sites. The panel examines the applications and recommends to the European Commission which sites should be awarded the label on the basis of an established set of criteria. Candidate sites must also submit a work plan.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://one-europe.info/initiative/the-european-heritage-label]"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Europeanheritagelabel.png|thumb|New European Heritage Label Logo]]

The logo of the new European Heritage Label was selected following a competition held in 2012.

The Label itself is awarded as a large plaque bearing an inscription in the national language and in English and a small plaque with just the logo. All of the large plaques contain the common element: "It features on the European Union’s list of European Heritage sites because of the significant role it has played in the history and culture of Europe."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7363">A '''family history society''' or '''genealogical society''' is a [[society]], often [[Charitable organization|charitable]] or [[not-for-profit]], that allows member [[genealogist]]s and [[family history|family historian]]s to profit from shared knowledge.  Large societies often own libraries, sponsor research seminars and foreign trips, and publish journals. Some societies concentrate on a specific niche, such as the family history of a particular geographical area, [[ethnicity]], [[nationality]], or [[religion]].  Lineage societies are societies that limit their membership to descendants of a particular person or group of people of historical importance.

'''''Historia regum Britanniae''''' (''The History of the Kings of Britain''), originally called '''''De gestis Britonum''''' (''On the Deeds of the Britons''), is a [[pseudohistory|pseudohistorical]] account of British history, written around 1136 by [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]. It chronicles the lives of the [[List of legendary kings of Britain|kings of the Britons]] over the course of two thousand years, beginning with the [[Troy|Trojans]] founding the [[Britons (historical)|British]] nation and continuing until the [[Anglo-Saxons]] assumed control of much of Britain around the 7th century. It is one of the central pieces of the [[Matter of Britain]].

Although taken as historical well into the 16th century,&lt;ref&gt;[[Polydore Vergil]]'s skeptical reading of Geoffrey of Monmouth provoked at first a reaction of denial in England, "yet the seeds of doubt once sown" eventually replaced Geoffrey's romances with a new Renaissance historical approach, according to Hans Baron, "Fifteenth-century civilization and the Renaissance", in ''The New Cambridge Modern history'', vol. 1 1957:56.&lt;/ref&gt; it is now considered to have no value as history. When events described, such as [[Julius Caesar]]'s [[Caesar's invasions of Britain|invasions of Britain]], can be corroborated from contemporary histories, Geoffrey's account can be seen to be wildly inaccurate. It remains, however, a valuable piece of medieval literature, which contains the earliest known version of the story of [[Leir of Britain|King Lear]] and his three daughters, and helped popularise the legend of [[King Arthur]].

==Contents==
===Dedication===
Geoffrey starts the book with a statement of his purpose in writing the history: "I have not been able to discover anything at all on the kings who lived here before the Incarnation of Christ, or indeed about Arthur and all the others who followed on after the Incarnation. Yet the deeds of these men were such that they deserve to be praised for all time." He claims that he was given a source for this period by [[Walter of Oxford|Archdeacon Walter]] of Oxford, who presented him with a "certain very ancient book written in the British language" from which he has translated his history. He also cites [[Gildas]] and [[Bede]] as sources. Then follows a dedication to [[Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester|Robert, earl of Gloucester]] and [[Waleran de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Worcester|Waleran, count of Meulan]], whom he enjoins to use their knowledge and wisdom to improve his tale.&lt;ref name="Thorpe1966"&gt;{{cite book|last=Thorpe|first=Lewis G. M.|authorlink=Lewis Thorpe|title=The history of the Kings of Britain|year=1966|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York|isbn=0-14-044170-0|pages=51–52|chapter=Dedication}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Book One===
The ''Historia'' itself begins with the [[Troy|Trojan]] [[Aeneas]], who according to Roman legend settled in Italy after the [[Trojan War]]. His great-grandson [[Brutus of Troy|Brutus]] is banished, and, after a period of wandering, is directed by the goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] to settle on an island in the western ocean. Brutus lands at [[Totnes]] and names the island, then called [[Albion]], "Britain" after himself. Brutus defeats the giants who are the only inhabitants of the island, and establishes his capital, Troia Nova, on the banks of the Thames; after his time it is renamed [[London]].

===Book Two===
When Brutus dies, his three sons, Locrinus, Kamber and Albanactus, divide the county between themselves; the three kingdoms are named Loegria (England), Kambria (Wales) and Albany (Scotland). The story then progresses rapidly through the reigns of the descendants of Locrinus, including [[Bladud]], who uses magic and even tries to fly, but dies in the process.

Bladud's son [[Leir of Britain|Leir]] reigns for sixty years. He has no sons, so upon reaching old age he decides to divide his kingdom among his three daughters, Goneril, Regan and Cordelia. To decide who should get the largest share, he asks his daughters how much they love him. Goneril and Regan give extravagant answers, but Cordelia answers simply and sincerely; angered, he gives Cordelia no land. Goneril and Regan are to share half the island with their husbands, the Dukes of Albany and Cornwall. Cordelia marries Aganippus, King of the Franks, and departs for Gaul. Soon Goneril and Regan and their husbands rebel and take the whole kingdom. After Leir has had all his attendants taken from him, he begins to regret his actions towards Cordelia and travels to Gaul. Cordelia receives him compassionately and restores his royal robes and retinue. Aganippus raises a Gaulish army for Leir, who returns to Britain, defeats his sons-in-law and regains the kingdom. Leir rules for three years and then dies; Cordelia inherits the throne and rules for five years before Marganus and Cunedagius, her sisters' sons, rebel against her. They imprison Cordelia; grief-stricken, she kills herself. Marganus and Cunedagius divide the kingdom between themselves, but soon quarrel and go to war with each other. Cunedagius eventually kills Marganus in Wales and retains the whole kingdom, ruling for thirty-three years. He is succeeded by his son Rivallo.

A later descendant of Cunedagius, King Gorboduc, has two sons called Ferreux and Porrex. They quarrel and both are eventually killed, sparking a civil war. This leads to Britain being ruled by five kings, who keep attacking each other. [[Dunvallo Molmutius]], the son of Cloten, the King of Cornwall, becomes pre-eminent. He eventually defeats the other kings and establishes his rule over the whole island. He is said to have "established the so-called [[Molmutine Laws]] which are still famous today among the English".

===Book Three===
Dunvallo's sons, [[Belinus]] and [[Brennius]], fight a civil war before being reconciled by their mother, and proceed to sack [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]. Victorious, Brennius remains in Italy, while Belinus returns to rule Britain.

Numerous brief accounts of successive kings follow. These include [[Lud son of Heli|Lud]], who renames [[Trinovantum]] "[[Caer|Kaer]]lud" after himself; this later becomes corrupted to Lon[[Dun|don]]. Lud is succeeded by his brother, [[Cassivellaunus|Cassibelanus]], as Lud's sons [[Mandubracius|Androgeus]] and [[Tasciovanus|Tenvantius]] are not yet of age. In recompense, Androgeus is made Duke of [[Kent]] and [[Trinovantum]] ([[London]]), and Tenvantius is made Duke of [[Cornwall]].

===Book Four===
After his conquest of Gaul, [[Julius Caesar]] looks over the sea and resolves to order Britain to swear obedience and pay tribute to Rome. His commands are answered by a letter of refusal from Cassivellaunus. Caesar sails a fleet to Britain, but he is overwhelmed by Cassivellaunus's army and forced to retreat to Gaul. Two years later he makes another attempt, but is again pushed back. Then Cassivellaunus quarrels with one of his dukes, Androgeus, who sends a letter to Caesar asking him to help avenge the duke's honour. Caesar invades once more and besieges Cassivellaunus on a hill. After several days Cassivellaunus offers to make peace with Caesar, and Androgeus, filled with remorse, goes to Caesar to plead with him for mercy. Cassivellaunus pays tribute and makes peace with Caesar, who then returns to Gaul.

Cassivelaunus dies and is succeeded by his nephew Tenvantius, as Androgeus has gone to Rome. Tenvantius is succeeded in turn by his son [[Cunobelinus|Kymbelinus]], and then Kymbelinus's son [[Guiderius]]. Guiderius refuses to pay tribute to emperor [[Claudius]], who then invades Britain. After [[Guiderius]] is killed in battle with the Romans, his brother [[Arvirargus]] continues the defence, but eventually agrees to submit to Rome, and is given the hand of Claudius's daughter Genvissa in marriage. Claudius returns to Rome, leaving the province under Arviragus's governorship.

The line of British kings continues under Roman rule, and includes [[Lucius of Britain|Lucius]], Britain's first [[Christianity|Christian]] king, and several Roman figures, including the emperor [[Constantine I]], the usurper [[Allectus]] and the military commander [[Asclepiodotus of Heraclea|Asclepiodotus]]. When Octavius passes the crown to his son-in-law Maximianus, his nephew Conan Meriadoc is given rule of Brittany to compensate him for not succeeding. After a long period of Roman rule, the Romans decide they no longer wish to defend the island and depart. The Britons are immediately besieged by attacks from Picts, Scots and Danes, especially as their numbers have been depleted due to Conan colonizing Brittany and Maximianus using British troops for his campaigns. In desperation the Britons send letters to the general of the Roman forces, asking for help, but receive no reply (this passage borrows heavily from the corresponding section in Gildas' ''[[De Excidio Britanniae]]'').

===Books Five and Six===
After the Romans leave, the Britons ask the King of Brittany (Armorica), Aldroenus, descended from Conan, to rule them. However Aldroenus instead sends his brother Constantine to rule the Britons. After Constantine's death [[Vortigern]] assists their eldest son Constans in succeeding, before enabling their murder and coming to power. Constantine's remaining sons [[Ambrosius Aurelianus|Aurelius Ambrosius]] and [[Uther Pendragon|Uther]] are too young to rule and are taken to safety in Amorica. Vortigern invites the [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxons]] under [[Hengest|Hengist]] and [[Horsa]] to fight for him as mercenaries, but they rise against him. He loses control of much of his land and encounters [[Merlin (wizard)|Merlin]].

===Book Seven: The Prophecies of Merlin===
At this point Geoffrey abruptly pauses his narrative by inserting a series of prophecies attributed to [[Merlin]]. Some of the prophecies act as an [[epitome]] of upcoming chapters of the ''Historia'', while others are veiled allusions to historical people and events of the [[Norman people|Norman]] world in the 11th-12th centuries. The remainder are obscure.

===Book Eight===
After Aurelius Ambrosius defeats and kills Vortigern, becoming king, Britain remains in a state of war under him and his brother Uther. They are both assisted by the wizard Merlin. At one point during the continuous string of battles, Ambrosius takes ill and Uther must lead the army for him. This allows an enemy assassin to pose as a physician and poison Ambrosius. When the king dies, a comet taking the form of a dragon's head ([[pendragon]]) appears in the night sky, which Merlin interprets as a sign that Ambrosius is dead and that Uther will be victorious and succeed him. So after defeating his latest enemies, Uther adds "Pendragon" to his name and is crowned king.

But another enemy strikes, forcing Uther to make war again. This time he is temporarily defeated, gaining final victory only with the help of [[Gorlois|Duke Gorlois of Cornwall]]. But while celebrating this victory with Gorlois, he falls in love with the duke's wife, [[Igraine|Igerna]]. This leads to war between Uther Pendragon and Gorlois of Cornwall, during which Uther clandestinely lies with Igerna through the magic of Merlin. [[King Arthur|Arthur]] is conceived that night. Then Gorlois is killed and Uther marries Igerna. But he must war against the Saxons again. Although Uther ultimately triumphs, he dies after drinking water from a spring the Saxons had poisoned.

===Books Nine and Ten===
Uther's son [[King Arthur|Arthur]] assumes the throne and defeats the Saxons so severely that they cease to be a threat until after his death. In the meantime, Arthur conquers most of northern Europe and ushers in a period of peace and prosperity that lasts until the Romans, led by [[Lucius Hiberius]], demands that Britain once again pay tribute to Rome. Arthur defeats Lucius in Gaul, intending to become Emperor, but in his absence, his nephew [[Mordred]] seduces and marries [[Guinevere]] and seizes the throne.

===Books Eleven and Twelve===
Arthur returns and kills Mordred at the [[Battle of Camlann]], but, mortally wounded, he is carried off to the isle of [[Avalon]], and hands the kingdom to his cousin [[Constantine III of Britain|Constantine]], son of [[Cador]] and Duke of Cornwall.

The Saxons returned after Arthur's death, but would not end the line of British kings until the death of [[Cadwaladr|Cadwallader]]. Cadwallader is forced to flee Britain and requests the aid of King Alan of the Amoricans. However an angel's voice tells him the Britons will no longer rule and he should go to Rome. Cadwallader does so, dying there, though leaves his son and nephew to rule the remaining Britons. The remaining Britons are driven into Wales and the Saxon Athelstan becomes King of Loegria.

Geoffrey claimed to have translated the ''Historia'' into Latin from "a very ancient book in the British tongue", given to him by [[Walter, Archdeacon of Oxford]].&lt;ref name="Thorpeintro"&gt;Thorpe (1966: 14–19)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wright|first=Neil|title=The Historia Regum Britannie of Geoffrey of Monmouth|year=1984|publisher=Boydell and Brewer|location=Woodbridge, England|isbn=978-0-85991-641-7|page=xvii}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lang|first=Andrew|authorlink=Andrew Lang|title=History Of English Literature - From  Beowulf to Swinburne|publisher=Vincent Press|page=45|quote=He says that he has had the advantage of using a book in the Breton tongue which Walter, Archdeacon of Oxford, brought out of Brittany; this book he translates into Latin.|oclc=220536211}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, no modern scholars take this claim seriously.&lt;ref name="Thorpeintro"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wright&gt;{{cite book|last=Wright|first=Neil|title=The Historia Regum Britannie of Geoffrey of Monmouth|year=1984|publisher=Boydell and Brewer|location=Woodbridge, England|isbn=978-0-85991-641-7|pages=xvii–xviii|quote=This fusion of heterogeneous sources, which is apparent almost everywhere in the ''Historia'', completely dispels the fiction that the work is no more than a translation of a single Breton (or Welsh) book}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"...the ''Historia'' does not bear scrutiny as an authentic history and no scholar today would regard it as such.": Wright (1984: xxviii)&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the work appears to be derived from [[Gildas]]'s 6th-century polemic ''[[The Ruin of Britain]]'', [[Bede]]'s 8th-century ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum|Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'', the 9th-century ''[[Historia Britonum|History of the Britons]]'' ascribed to [[Nennius]], the 10th-century ''[[Annales Cambriae|Welsh Annals]]'', medieval Welsh genealogies (such as the [[Harleian Genealogies]]) and king-lists, the poems of [[Taliesin]], the Welsh tale ''[[Culhwch and Olwen]]'', and some of the medieval Welsh saints' lives,&lt;ref name="Thorpeintro" /&gt; expanded and turned into a continuous narrative by Geoffrey's own imagination.

==Influence==
In an exchange of manuscript material for their own histories, [[Robert of Torigny]] gave [[Henry of Huntington]] a copy of ''Historia Regum Britanniae'', which both Robert and Henry used uncritically as authentic history and subsequently used in their own works,&lt;ref&gt;[[C. Warren Hollister]], ''Henry I'' (Yale English Monarchs), 2001:11 note44.&lt;/ref&gt; by which means some of Geoffrey's fictions became embedded in popular history. The history of Geoffrey forms the basis for much [[Great Britain|British]] lore and literature as well as being a rich source of material for [[Welsh language|Welsh]] [[bard]]s. It became tremendously popular during the [[High Middle Ages]], revolutionising views of British history before and during the Anglo-Saxon period despite the criticism of such writers as [[William of Newburgh]] and [[Giraldus Cambrensis|Gerald of Wales]].{{cn|date=November 2017}} The prophecies of Merlin in particular were often drawn on in later periods, for instance by both sides in the issue of [[History of England|English]] influence over [[History of Scotland|Scotland]] under [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] and his successors.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

The ''Historia'' was quickly translated into [[Norman language|Norman]] verse by [[Wace]] (the ''[[Roman de Brut]]'') in 1155.  Wace's version was in turn translated into [[Middle English]] verse by [[Layamon]] (the ''[[Brut (Layamon)|Brut]]'') in the early 13th century.  In the second quarter of the 13th century, a version in Latin verse, the ''[[Gesta Regum Britanniae]]'', was produced by [[William of Rennes]].  Material from Geoffrey was incorporated into a large variety of [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] and [[Middle English]] prose compilations of historical material from the 13th century onward.

Geoffrey was translated into a number of different Welsh prose versions by the end of the 13th century,&lt;ref&gt;A. O. H. Jarman, ''Geoffrey of Monmouth'', University of Wales Press, 1965, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; collectively known as ''[[Brut y Brenhinedd]]''. One variant of the ''Brut y Brenhinedd'', the so-called ''Brut Tysilio'', was proposed in 1917 by the [[archaeology|archaeologist]] [[William Matthew Flinders Petrie|William Flinders Petrie]] to be the ancient British book that Geoffrey translated,&lt;ref&gt;[[William Matthew Flinders Petrie|Sir William Flinders Petrie]], ''[[s:Neglected British History|Neglected British History]]'', 1917&lt;/ref&gt; although the ''Brut'' itself claims to have been translated from Latin by Walter of Oxford, based on his own earlier translation from Welsh to Latin.&lt;ref&gt;William R. Cooper, ''[http://www.annomundi.com/history/chronicle_of_the_early_britons.pdf Chronicle of the Early Britons]'' (pdf), 2002, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; Geoffrey's work is greatly important because it brought the Welsh culture into British society and made it acceptable. It is also the first record we have of the great figure King Lear, and the beginning of the mythical King Arthur figure. 

For many centuries, the ''Historia'' was accepted at face value, and much of its material was incorporated into [[Raphael Holinshed|Holinshed]]'s 16th-century ''Chronicles''.

Modern historians have regarded the ''Historia'' as a work of fiction with some factual information contained within. [[John Morris (historian)|John Morris]] in ''The Age of Arthur'' calls it a "deliberate spoof", although this is based on misidentifying Walter, archdeacon of Oxford, as [[Walter Map]], a satirical writer who lived a century later.&lt;ref&gt;John Morris. ''The Age of Arthur: A History of the British Isles from 350 to 650''. Barnes &amp; Noble Books: New York. 1996 (originally 1973). {{ISBN|0-7607-0243-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It continues to have an influence on popular culture, e.g. [[Mary Stewart's Merlin Trilogy|Mary Stewart's ''Merlin Trilogy'']] and the TV miniseries ''[[Merlin (miniseries)|Merlin]]'' both contain large elements taken from the ''Historia''.

==Manuscript tradition and textual history==
Two hundred and fifteen medieval manuscripts of the ''Historia'' survive, dozens of them copied before the end of the 12th century. Even among the earliest manuscripts a large number of [[Textual criticism|textual]] variants, such as the so-called "First Variant", can be discerned. These are reflected in the three possible prefaces to the work and in the presence or absence of certain episodes and phrases. Certain variants may be due to "authorial" additions to different early copies, but most probably reflect early attempts to alter, add to or edit the text. Unfortunately, the task of disentangling these variants and establishing Geoffrey's original text is long and complex, and the extent of the difficulties surrounding the text has been established only recently.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

The variant title ''Historia regum Britaniae'' was introduced in the Middle Ages, and this became the most common form in the modern period. A critical edition of the work published in 2007, however, demonstrated that the most accurate manuscripts refer to the work as ''De gestis Britonum'', and that this was the title Geoffrey himself used to refer to the work.{{sfn|Reeve|2007|p=lix}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39377">{{for|the denial and distortion of the historical record|Historical negationism}}
In [[historiography]], the term '''historical revisionism''' identifies the re-interpretation of the historical record. It usually means challenging the [[wikt:orthodox|orthodox]] (established, accepted or traditional) views held by professional scholars about a historical event, introducing contrary evidence, or reinterpreting the motivations and decisions of the people involved. The revision of the [[historical record]] can reflect new discoveries of fact, evidence, and interpretation, which then provokes a revised history.  In dramatic cases, revisionism involves a reversal of older moral judgments.

At a basic level, legitimate historical revisionism is a common and not especially controversial process of developing and refining the writing of history. Much more controversial  is the reversal of moral findings, in which what had been considered to be positive forces are depicted as being negative. This revisionism is then challenged by the supporters of the previous view, often in heated terms, and becomes an illegitimate form of historical revisionism known as [[historical negationism]] if it involves inappropriate methods such as the use of forged documents or implausible distrust of genuine documents, attributing false conclusions to books and sources, manipulating statistical data and deliberately mis-translating texts. This type of historical revisionism presents a re-interpretation of the moral meaning of the historical record.&lt;ref name="Evans-145"&gt;''Lying About Hitler: History, Holocaust, and the David Irving Trial'', by [[Richard J. Evans]], 2001, {{ISBN|0-465-02153-0}}. p. 145. The author is a professor of Modern History, at the [[University of Cambridge]], and was a major expert-witness in the ''Irving v. Lipstadt'' trial; the book presents his perspective of the trial, and the expert-witness report, including his research about the Dresden death count.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term "revisionism" is used pejoratively by those who claim that revisionists are distorting the historical record.  This is especially the case when it is applied to [[Holocaust denial]].

==Historical scholarship==
{{Globalize/US|date=August 2018}}
Historical revisionism is the means by which the [[historical record]] — the history of a society, as understood in their [[collective memory]] — continually integrates new facts and interpretations of the events commonly understood as [[history]]; about which the historian and [[American Historical Association]] member [[James M. McPherson]], said:

{{Quote|The fourteen-thousand members of this [[American Historical Association|association]], however, know that revision is the lifeblood of historical scholarship. History is a continuing [[Discourse|dialogue]], between the present and the past. Interpretations of the past are subject to change in response to new evidence, new questions asked of the evidence, new perspectives gained by the passage of time. There is no single, eternal, and immutable “[[truth]]” about past events and their meaning.

The unending quest of historians for understanding the past — that is, ''revisionism'' — is what makes history vital and meaningful. Without revisionism, we might be stuck with the images of [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] [1865–77] after the [[American Civil War]] [1861–65] that were conveyed by [[D. W. Griffith]]’s ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' [1915] and [[Claude Bowers]]’s ''The Tragic Era'' [1929]. Were the [[Gilded Age]] [1870s–1900] entrepreneurs “[[Captain of industry|Captains of Industry]]” or “[[Robber baron (industrialist)|Robber Barons]]”?

Without  revisionist historians, who have done research in new sources and asked new and nuanced questions, we would remain mired in one or another of these stereotypes. Supreme Court decisions often reflect a “revisionist” interpretation of history, as well as of the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historians.org/perspectives/issues/2003/0309/0309pre1.cfm Revisionist Historians]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the field of [[historiography]], the [[historian]] who works within the existing [[The Establishment|establishment]] of society, and who has produced a body of [[history books]], from which he or she can claim [[Authority (sociology)|authority]], usually benefits from the ''[[status quo]]''. As such, the professional-historian [[paradigm]] is manifested as a [[Reflex reaction|denunciative stance]] towards any form of historical revisionism — either of fact or interpretation, or both. In contrast to the single-paradigm form of writing history, the philosopher of science, [[Thomas Kuhn]], said, in contrast to the quantifiable [[hard sciences]], characterized by a single paradigm, the [[social sciences]] are characterized by several paradigms that derive from a “tradition of claims, counterclaims, and debates over [the] fundamentals” of [[research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kuhn|first= Thomas N.|authorlink=Thomas Kuhn|editor1-last=Lakatos|editor1-first=Imre|editor2-last=Musgrave|editor2-first=Alan|editor1-link=Imre Lakatos|editor2-link= Alan Musgrave|title=Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge|edition= second|origyear= 1970|year=1972|publisher=Cambridge University Press |location= Cambridge |isbn= 0-521-09623-5 |page= 6|chapter=Logic of Discovery or Psychology of Research }}&lt;/ref&gt; About resistance against the works of revised history that present a [[Postcolonialism|culturally comprehensive]] historical narrative of the U.S. — the perspectives of [[black people]], [[feminism|women]], and the [[labour movement]] — the historian David Williams said:

{{Quote|These, and other, scholarly voices, called for a more comprehensive treatment of American history, stressing that the mass of Americans, not simply the power élites, made history. Yet, it was mainly white males of the power élite who had the means to attend college, become professional historians, and shape a view of history that served their own [[Social class|class]], race, and gender interests at the expense of those not so fortunate — and, quite literally, to paper over aspects of history they found uncomfortable. “One is astonished in the study of history”, wrote [[W. E. B. Du Bois|Du Bois]] in 1935, “at the recurrence of the idea that evil must be forgotten, distorted, skimmed over. . . . The difficulty, of course, with this philosophy is that history loses its value, as an incentive and [as] an example; it paints perfect men and noble nations, but it does not tell the truth”.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, David. ''A People's History of the Civil War: Struggles for the Meaning of Freedom.''(2005) pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After the Second World War, the study and production of history in the U.S. was expanded by the [[G.I. Bill]], which funding allowed “a new and more broadly-based generation of scholars” with perspectives and interpretations drawn from the [[feminist movement]], the [[civil rights movement]], and the [[American Indian Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; That expansion and deepening of the pool of historians voided the existence of a definitive and universally accepted history, therefore, the revisionist historian presents the national public with a history that has been corrected and augmented with new facts, evidence, and interpretations of the historical record. In ''The Cycles of American History'' (1986), in contrasting and comparing the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. during the [[Cold War|Russo–American Cold War]] (1945–91), the historian [[Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.]] said:

{{Quote|. . . but others, especially in the United States . . . represent what American historians call ''revisionism'' — that is a readiness to challenge official explanations. No one should be surprised by this phenomenon. Every war in American history has been followed, in due course, by skeptical reassessments of supposedly sacred assumptions . . .  for [historical] revisionism is an essential part of the process, by which history, through the posing of new problems and the investigation of new possibilities, enlarges its perspectives and enriches its insights.&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger, Arthur M. Jr. ''The Cycles of American History.''(1986) p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Revisionist historians contest the mainstream or traditional view of historical events, they raise views at odds with traditionalists, which must be freshly judged. Revisionist history is often practiced by those who are in the minority, such as feminist historians, ethnic minority historians, those working outside of mainstream academia in smaller and less known universities, or the youngest scholars, essentially historians who have the most to gain and the least to lose in challenging the status quo. In the friction between the mainstream of accepted beliefs and the new perspectives of historical revisionism, received historical ideas are either changed, solidified, or clarified. If over a period of time the revisionist ideas become the new establishment ''status quo'' a [[paradigm shift]] is said to have occurred. Historian [[Forrest McDonald]] is often critical of the turn that revisionism has taken, but he nevertheless admits that the turmoil of the 1960s in the United States changed the way history was written:

{{Quote|The result, as far as the study of history was concerned, was an awakened interest in subjects that historians had previously slighted. Indian history, black history, women’s history, family history, and a host of specializations arose. These expanded horizons enriched our understanding of the American past, but they also resulted in works of special pleading, trivialization, and downright falsification.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, Forest. ''Recovering the Past: A Historian's Memoir.'' (2004) p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Historians are influenced by the ''[[zeitgeist]]'' (spirit of the time), and the usually progressive changes to society, politics, and culture, which occurred after the [[Second World War]] (1939–45); in ''The Future of the Past'' (1989), the historian [[C. Vann Woodward]] said:

{{Quote|These events have come with a concentration and violence for which the term ''revolution'' is usually reserved. It is a revolution, or perhaps a set of revolutions for which we have not yet found a name. My thesis is that these developments will and should raise new questions about the past, and affect our reading of large areas of history, and my belief is that future revisions may be extensive enough to justify calling the coming age of historiography an “Age of Reinterpretation”. The first illustration [the absence from U.S. history of external threats, because of geography] happens to come mainly from American history, but this should not obscure the broader scope of the revolution, which has no national limitations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Woodward |first=C. Vann |title=The Future of the Past |year=1989 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0195057447 |page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Developments in the academy, culture, and politics shaped the contemporary model of writing history — the accepted paradigm of [[historiography]]; the philosopher [[Karl Popper]] said: "each generation has its own troubles and problems, and, therefore, its own interests and its own point of view", and that:

{{Quote|sign=|source=|it follows that each generation has a right to look upon and re-interpret history in [their] own way. . . . After all, we study history because we are interested in it, and perhaps because we wish to learn something about our [contemporary] problems. But history can serve neither of these two purposes if, under the influence of an inapplicable idea of objectivity, we hesitate to present historical problems from our point of view. And we should not think that our point of view, if consciously and critically applied to the problem, will be inferior to that of a writer who naïvely believes . . . that he has reached a level of objectivity permitting him to present "the events of the past as they actually did happen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Novick |first=Peter |title=That Noble Dream: The Objectivity Question and the American Historical Profession |year=1988 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0521357456 |page=395}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As the social, political, and cultural influences change a society, most historians revise and update their explanation of historical events. The old consensus, based upon limited evidence, might no longer be considered historically valid in explaining the particulars — of cause and effect, of motivation and self-interest — that tell ''How?'' and ''Why?'' the past occurred as it occurred; therefore, the historical revisionism of the factual record is revised to concord with the contemporary understanding of history. As such, in 1986, the historian John Hope Franklin described four stages in the historiography of the African experience of life in the U.S., which were based upon different models of historical consensus.&lt;ref&gt;African-American History: Origins, Development, and Current State of the Field | Joe W. Trotter | [[Organization of American Historians]] Magazine of History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Negationism and denial==
{{main|Historical negationism}}

The historian [[Deborah Lipstadt]] (''[[Denying the Holocaust|Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory]]'', 1993), and the historians [[Michael Shermer]] and [[Alex Grobman]] (''[[Denying History|Denying History: Who Says the Holocaust Never Happened and Why Do They Say It?]]'', 2002), distinguish between historical revisionism and historical negationism, the latter of which is a form of [[denialism]]. Lipstadt said that [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust deniers]], such as [[Harry Elmer Barnes]], disingenuously self-identify as "historical revisionists" in order to [[Obscurantism|obscure]] their denialism as academic revision of the historical record.

As such, Lipstadt, Shermer, and Grobman said that legitimate historical revisionism entails the refinement of existing knowledge about a historical event, not a denial of the event, itself; that such refinement of history emerges from the examination of new, empirical evidence, and a re-examination, and consequent re-interpretation of the existing documentary evidence. That legitimate historical revisionism acknowledges the existence of a "certain body of irrefutable evidence" and the existence of a "convergence of evidence", which suggest that an event — such as the [[Black Death]], [[Slavery in the United States|American slavery]], and [[the Holocaust]] — did occur; whereas the denialism of history rejects the entire foundation of historical evidence, which is a form of historical negationism.&lt;ref&gt;Lipstadt 1993:21; Shermer &amp; Grobman 200:34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ronald J. Berger. ''Fathoming the Holocaust: A Social Problems Approach'', Aldine Transaction, 2002, {{ISBN|0-202-30670-4}}, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2015}}
Some of the influences on historians, which may change over time are:

*'''Access to new data:''' Much historical data has been lost. Even [[archives]] have to make decisions based on space and interest on what original material to obtain or keep. At times documents are discovered or publicized that give new views of well established events. Archived material may be sealed by Governments for many years, either to hide political scandals, or to protect information vital for national security. When these archives are opened, they can alter the historical perspective on an event. For example, with the release of the [[Ultra (cryptography)|ULTRA]] archives in the 1970s under the British 30 years rule, a lot of the Allied high command tactical decision making process was re-evaluated, particularly the [[Battle of the Atlantic]]. &lt;!-- Before the release of the ULTRA archives, there was much debate over whether Field Marshal [[Bernard Montgomery]] could have known that [[Arnhem]] was heavily garrisoned. With the release of the archives, which indicated that they were, the balance of the evidence swung in the direction of his detractors.--&gt; The release of the ULTRA archives also forced a re-evaluation of the [[History of computing hardware|history of the electronic computer]].&lt;ref&gt;In 1972, before the release of official documents about ULTRA, [[Herman Goldstine]] wrote in ''The Computer from Pascal to von Neumann'' page 321 that: "Britain had such vitality that it could immediately after the war embark on so many well-conceived and well-executed projects in the computer field." In 1976 after the archive were opened [[Brian Randell]] wrote in ''The COLOSSUS'' on page 87 that: "the COLOSSUS project was an important source of this vitality, one that has been largely unappreciated, as has the significance of its places in the chronology of the invention of the digital computer."&lt;/ref&gt; 
** '''New sources in other languages:''' As more sources in other languages become available historians may review their theories in light of the new sources. The revision of the meaning of the [[#The Dark Ages|Dark Ages]] are an example of this.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}
* '''Developments in other fields of science:''' [[DNA]] analysis has had an impact in various areas of history either confirming established historical theories or presenting new evidence that undermines the current established historical explanation. Professor [[Andrew Sherratt]], a British prehistorian, was responsible for introducing the work of anthropological writings on the consumption of currently legal and illegal drugs and how to use these papers to explain certain aspects of prehistoric societies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.independent.co.uk/people/obituaries/article349471.ece Obituary of Andrew Sherratt] in ''[[The Independent]]'' 6 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carbon dating]], the examination of [[ice core]]s and [[tree rings]], [[palynology]], [[Scanning electron microscope|SEM analysis]] of early metal samples, and measuring [[oxygen isotopes]] in bones, have all provided new data in the last few decades with which to argue new hypotheses. Extracting [[ancient DNA]] allows scientists to argue whether or not humans are partly descended from [[Neanderthals]].
* '''Nationalism:''' For example, when reading schoolbook history in Europe, it is possible to read about an event from completely different perspectives. In the [[Battle of Waterloo]] most British, French, Dutch and German schoolbooks slant the battle to emphasise the importance of the contribution of their nations. Sometimes the name of an event is used to convey political or a national perspective. For example, the same conflict between two English-speaking countries is known by two different names: the "[[American War of Independence]]" and the "[[American Revolutionary War]]". As perceptions of nationalism change so do those areas of history that are driven by such ideas.
* '''Culture:''' For example, as regionalism has become more prominent in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] some historians have been suggesting that the [[English Civil War]] is too Anglo-centric and that to understand the war, events that had previously been dismissed as on the periphery should be given greater prominence; to emphasise this, revisionist historians have suggested that the English Civil War becomes just one of a number of interlocking conflicts known as [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]. Furthermore, as cultures develop, it may become strategically advantageous for some revision-minded groups to revise their public historical narrative in such a way so as to either discover, or in rarer cases manufacture, a precedent which contemporary members of the given subcultures can use as a basis or rationale for reform or change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shindler|first1=Michael|title=A Discussion On The Purpose of Cultural Identity|journal=The Apollonian Revolt|date=2014|url=http://theapollonianrevolt.com/structure-purpose-cultural-identity/|accessdate=10 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419090905/http://theapollonianrevolt.com/structure-purpose-cultural-identity/|archivedate=19 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Ideology:''' For example, during the 1940s it became fashionable to see the English Civil War from a Marxist school of thought. In the words of [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]], "the Civil War was a class war." In the post [[World War II]] years the influence of Marxist interpretation waned in British academia and by the 1970s this view came under attack by a new school of revisionists and it has been largely overturned as a major mainstream explanation of the middle 17th century conflict in [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]].
*'''Historical causation:''' Issues of [[causality|causation]] in history are often revised with new research: for example by the middle of the twentieth century the status quo was to see the [[French Revolution]] as the result of the triumphant rise of a new [[middle class]]. Research in the 1960s prompted by revisionist historians like [[Alfred Cobban]] and [[François Furet]] revealed the social situation as much more complex and the question of what caused the Revolution is now a closely debated one.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==Revised versions==

===The Dark Ages===
As non-[[Latin]] texts, such as [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Gaelic languages|Gaelic]] and the [[Old Norse|Norse]] [[saga]]s have been analysed and added to the canon of knowledge about the period and a much more [[archaeological]] evidence has come to light, the period known as the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] has narrowed to the point where many historians no longer believe that such a term is useful. Moreover, the term "dark" implies less of a void of culture and law, but more a lack of many [[source text]]s in mainland [[Europe]]. Many modern scholars who study the era tend to avoid the term altogether for its [[negative connotation]]s, finding it misleading and inaccurate for any part of the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Snyder|first=Christopher A.|author-link=Christopher Snyder|year=1998|contribution=|contribution-url=|title=An Age of Tyrants: Britain and the Britons A.D. 400&amp;ndash;600|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press|publication-date=1998|publication-place=University Park|pages=xiii&amp;ndash;xiv|isbn=0-271-01780-5|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}, for example. This work contains over 100 pages of footnoted citations to source material and bibliographic references (pp. 263&amp;ndash;387). In explaining his approach to writing the work, he refers to the "so-called Dark Ages", noting that "Historians and archaeologists have never liked the label Dark Ages ... there are numerous indicators that these centuries were neither "dark" nor "barbarous" in comparison with other eras."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dmas&gt;[[William Chester Jordan|Jordan, Chester William]] (2004). ''[[Dictionary of the Middle Ages]]'', Supplement 1. Verdun, Kathleen, "Medievalism" pp. 389–397. Sections 'Victorian Medievalism', 'Nineteenth-Century Europe', 'Medievalism in America 1500–1900', 'The 20th Century'. Same volume, [[Paul Freedman|Freedman, Paul]], "Medieval Studies", pp. 383–389.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feudalism===
The concept of [[feudalism]] has been questioned. Revisionist scholars led by historian [[Elizabeth A. R. Brown]] have [[Feudalism#Challenges to the feudal model|rejected the term]].

===Agincourt===
For centuries, historians thought the [[Battle of Agincourt]] was an engagement in which the English army, though overwhelmingly outnumbered four to one by the [[France|French]] army, pulled off a stunning victory—a version especially popularised by [[Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]''. However, recent research by Professor [[Anne Curry]], using the original enrollment records, has brought into question this interpretation. Though her research is not finished,&lt;ref&gt;Page 288. Matthew Strickland ''The Great Warbow''. Pub Sutton, 2005, {{ISBN|0-7509-3167-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; she has published her initial findings,&lt;ref&gt;[[Anne Curry]]. ''Agincourt: A New History'', Pub Tempus, 2005, {{ISBN|0-7524-2828-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the French only outnumbered the English and Welsh 12,000 to 8,000. If true, the numbers may have been exaggerated for patriotic reasons by the English.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Brooks ''[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/printFriendly/0,,1-523-1632547,00.html Henry V's payroll cuts Agincourt myth down to size]'' May 29, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===New World discovery===
In recounting the [[European colonization of the Americas]], some history books of the past paid little attention to the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]], usually mentioning them only in passing and making no attempt to understand the events from their point of view. This was reflected in the description of [[Christopher Columbus]] having discovered America. The portrayal of these events has since been revised, avoiding the word "discovery."&lt;ref&gt;Kay Larson, and Edith Newhall, "It's a Map, Map, Map World" [https://books.google.com/books?id=i-MCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA97 ''New York Magazine'' Nov 1992 25#43 pp 97+  online]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1990 revisionist book, ''The Conquest of Paradise: Christopher Columbus and the Columbian Legacy'', [[Kirkpatrick Sale]] argued that [[Christopher Columbus]] was an imperialist bent on conquest from his first voyage. In a ''New York Times'' book review, historian and member of the Christopher Columbus Quincentenary Jubilee Committee [[William Hardy McNeill]] wrote about Sale: 
:he has set out to destroy the heroic image that earlier writers have transmitted to us. Mr. Sale makes Columbus out to be cruel, greedy and incompetent (even as a sailor), and a man who was perversely intent on abusing the natural paradise on which he intruded."&lt;ref&gt;William H. McNeill, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE5DD1739F934A35753C1A966958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all Review of Kirkpatrick Sale's ''The Conquest of Paradise''], ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 7, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

McNeill declares Sale's work to be "unhistorical, in the sense that [it] selects from the often cloudy record of Columbus's actual motives and deeds what suits the researcher's 20th-century purposes."  McNeill states that detractors and advocates of Columbus present a "sort of history [that] caricatures the complexity of human reality by turning Columbus into either a bloody ogre or a plaster saint, as the case may be."&lt;ref&gt;McNeill, October 7, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

===French attack formations in the Napoleonic wars===
The military historian [[James R. Arnold]] argues that:
{{quote|The writings of Sir [[Charles Oman]] and Sir [[John William Fortescue|John Fortescue]] dominated subsequent English-language Napoleonic history. Their views [that the French infantry used heavy columns to attack lines of infantry] became very much the received wisdom.... By 1998 a new paradigm seemed to have set in with the publication of two books devoted to Napoleonic battle tactics. Both claimed that the French fought in line at Maida and both fully explored French tactical variety. The 2002 publication of ''The Battle of Maida 1806: Fifteen Minutes of Glory'', appeared to have brought the issue of column versus line to a satisfactory conclusion: "The contemporary sources are ... the best evidence and their conclusion is clear: General [[Louis Fursy Henri Compère|Compère's]] brigade formed into line to attack [[James Kempt|Kempt's]] Light Battalion." The decisive [[action at Maida]] took place in less than fifteen minutes. It had taken 72 years to rectify a great historian's error about what transpired during those minutes.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, James R. ''[http://www.napoleon-series.org/military/organization/maida/c_maida.html A Reappraisal of Column Versus Line in the Peninsular War Oman and Historiography]'', [[The Napoleon Series]], August 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James R. Arnold, "A Reappraisal of Column Versus Line in the Napoleonic Wars" ''[[Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research]]'' LX no. 244 (Winter 1982): pp. 196–208.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===World War I===
 {{see also|Causes of World War I}}

====German guilt====
In reaction to the orthodox interpretation enshrined in the [[Versailles Treaty]] (which declared that Germany was guilty of starting World War I), the self-described "revisionist" historians of the 1920s rejected the orthodox view and presented a complex causation in which several other countries were equally guilty. Intense debate continues among scholars.&lt;ref&gt;See Selig Adler, "The War-Guilt Question and American Disillusionment, 1918–1928", ''Journal of Modern History,'' Vol. 23, No. 1 (Mar., 1951), pp. 1–28 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1871365 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Poor British and French military leadership====
The military leadership of the [[British Army]] during [[World War I]] was frequently condemned as poor by historians and politicians for decades after the war ended. Common charges were that the generals commanding the army were blind to the realities of [[trench warfare]], ignorant of the conditions of their men and were unable to learn from their mistakes, thus causing enormous numbers of casualties ("[[lions led by donkeys]]").&lt;ref&gt;Lions Led By Donkeys
*Thompson, P.A. ''[http://www.churchillbooks.com/detail.cfm?item_num=38200&amp;is_mil_book=1 ''Lions Led By Donkeys: Showing How Victory In The Great War Was Achieved By Those Who Made the Fewest Mistakes''] T. Werner Laurie, Ltd. 1st English Edition. 1927
*Bournes, John. [http://www.firstworldwar.bham.ac.uk/donkey/index.htm "Lions Led By Donkeys"], Centre for First World War Studies, [[University of Birmingham]].&lt;/ref&gt; However, during the 1960s, historians such as [[John Terraine]] began to challenge this interpretation. In recent years, as new documents have come forth and the passage of time has allowed for more objective analysis, historians such as [[Gary D. Sheffield]] and [[Richard Holmes (military historian)|Richard Holmes]] observe that the military leadership of the British Army on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] had to cope with many problems that they could not control, such as a lack of adequate military [[communication]]s, which was not known before. Furthermore, military leadership improved throughout the war, culminating in the [[Hundred Days Offensive]] advance to victory in 1918. Some historians, even revisionists, still criticise the British High Command severely, but they are less inclined to portray the war in a simplistic manner with brave troops being led by foolish officers.

There has been a similar movement regarding the French Army during the war with contributions by historians such as [[Anthony Clayton]]. Revisionists are far more likely to view commanders such as French General [[Ferdinand Foch]], British General [[Douglas Haig]] and other figures, such as American [[John J. Pershing|General Pershing]], in a sympathetic light.

===Reconstruction in U.S.===
Revisionist historians of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction after the U.S. Civil War]] rejected the dominant [[Dunning School]] that stated the blacks were used by [[carpetbaggers]], and instead has stressed economic greed on the part of northern businessmen.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Weisberger, "The Dark and Bloody Ground of Reconstruction Historiography", ''The Journal of Southern History,'' Vol. 25, No. 4 (Nov., 1959), pp. 427–447 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2954450 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, in recent years a "[[neoabolitionist]]" revisionism has become standard, that uses the moral standards of racial equality of the 19th century abolitionists to criticize racial policies. "Foner's book represents the mature and settled Revisionist perspective," historian Michael Perman has concluded regarding [[Eric Foner]]'s ''Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863–1877'' (1988)&lt;ref&gt;Michael Perman, "Review: Eric Foner's Reconstruction: A Finished Revolution", ''Reviews in American History'', Vol. 17, No. 1 (Mar., 1989), pp. 73–78 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2703129 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guilt for causing World War II===
{{Main|Causes of World War II}}
The orthodox interpretation blamed Hitler and Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan for causing the war. Revisionist historians of World War II, notably [[Charles A. Beard]], said the U.S. was partly to blame because it pressed the Japanese too hard in 1940–41 and rejected compromises.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Flagg Bemis, "First Gun of a Revisionist Historiography for the Second World War", ''Journal of Modern History,'' Vol. 19, No. 1 (Mar., 1947), pp. 55–59 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1875652 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable contributions to this discussion include Charles Tansill, ''Back Door To War'' (Chicago, 1952); Frederic Sanborn, ''Design For War'' (New York, 1951); and David Hoggan, ''The Forced War'' (Costa Mesa, 1989).  British historian [[A. J. P. Taylor]] ignited a firestorm when he argued Hitler was a rather ordinary diplomat and did not deliberately set out to cause a war.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Martel, ed. ''The Origins of the Second World War Reconsidered: A.J.P. Taylor and the Historians.'' (2nd ed. 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Patrick Buchanan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Patrick J. Buchanan |authorlink=Pat Buchanan |title=Churchill, Hitler and the Unnecessary War: How Britain Lost Its Empire and the West Lost the World |year=2009 |publisher=Three Rivers Press |isbn=978-0307405166}}{{page needed|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; an American conservative [[pundit]], argued the Anglo–French guarantee to Poland in 1939 encouraged Poland not to seek a compromise over Danzig, though Britain and France were in no position to come to Poland's aid, and Hitler was offering the Poles an alliance in return. He argues that they thereby turned a minor border dispute into a catastrophic world conflict, and handed East Europe, including Poland, to Stalin. Buchanan further argued the British pact with Poland ensured the country would be invaded, as Stalin knew the British Empire would not be able to declare war on Germany and the Soviet Union in 1939.

===American business and the "Robber Barons"===
The role of American business and the alleged [[Robber baron (industrialist)|"robber barons"]] began to be revised in the 1930s. Termed "business revisionism" by [[Gabriel Kolko]], historians such as [[Allan Nevins]], and, later, [[Alfred D. Chandler]] emphasized the positive contributions of individuals who were previously pictured as villains.&lt;ref&gt;Kolko, Gabriel. "The Premises of Business Revisionism" in ''The Business History Review'', Vol. 33, No. 3 (Autumn, 1959), p. 334&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Novick writes, "The argument that whatever the moral delinquencies of the robber barons, these were far outweighed by their decisive contributions to American military [and industrial] prowess, was frequently invoked by Allan Nevins."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Novick |first=Peter |title=That Noble Dream: The Objectivity Question and the American Historical profession |year=1988 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0521357456 |page=343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cold War===
In the [[historiography of the Cold War]] a debate exists between historians advocating an "orthodox" and "revisionist" interpretation of [[Soviet history]] and other aspects of the [[Cold War]] such as the [[Vietnam War]].{{cn|date=August 2018}}

====Vietnam War====
''[[America in Vietnam]]'' (1978), by [[Guenter Lewy]], is an example of historical revisionism that differs much from the popular view of the role of the U.S. in the [[Vietnam War]] (1955–75), for which the author was criticised and supported for belonging to the revisionist school on the history of the Vietnam War.&lt;ref name="tri"/&gt;&lt;ref name="reverse"&gt;{{cite journal| first = Robert A.| last = Divine| authorlink =| coauthors =|date=September 1979| title = Review: Revisionism in Reverse| journal = [[Reviews in American History]]| volume = 7| issue = 3| pages = 433–438| id =| doi = 10.2307/2701181| last2 = Lewy| first2 = Guenter| last3 = Millett| first3 = Allan R. | author3link =Allan R. Millett| jstor=2701181}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewy's reinterpretation was the first book of a body of work by historians of the revisionist school about the [[Geopolitics|geopolitical]] role and the military behavior of the United States in the country of Vietnam.

In the Introduction to ''America in Vietnam'', Lewy said:

{{Quote|It is the reasoned conclusion of this study . . . that the sense of guilt created by the Vietnam war in the minds of many Americans is not warranted and that the charges of ''officially, condoned'' illegal and grossly immoral conduct are without substance. Indeed, detailed examination of battlefield practices reveals that the loss of civilian life in Vietnam was less great than in [[World War II]] [1939–45] and [[Korean War|Korea]] [1950–53] and that concern with minimizing the ravages of the war was strong. To measure and compare the devastation and loss of human life caused by different war will be objectionable to those who repudiate all resort to military force as an instrument of foreign policy and may be construed as callousness. Yet as long as wars do take place at all it remains a moral duty to seek to reduce the agony caused by war, and the fulfillment of this obligation should not be disdained.|''America in Vietnam'' (1979), p. vii.&lt;ref&gt;Guenter Lewy, ''America in Vietnam'', p. VII.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Other reinterpretations of the historical record of the [[U.S. war in Vietnam]], which offer alternative explanations for American behavior, include ''Why We Are in Vietnam'' (1982), by [[Norman Podhoretz]],&lt;ref name="tri"&gt;{{cite journal| first = Ian| last = Horwood| authorlink =| coauthors =| year =| month =| title = Book review: Triumph Forsaken: The Vietnam War, 1954–1965| journal = [[Institute of Historical Research]]| volume =| issue =| pages =| id =| url = http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/paper/horwood.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Triumph Forsaken: The Vietnam War, 1954–1965'' (2006), by [[Mark Moyar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mark Moyar |title=Triumph Forsaken: The Vietnam War, 1954–1965 |year=2006 |isbn=0-521-86911-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Vietnam: The Necessary War''  (1999), by [[Michael Lind]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Michael Lind |title=Vietnam: The Necessary War |year=1999 |publisher=Free Press |isbn=978-0684842547}}{{page needed|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institut Nova Història''' (INH) is a [[Catalonia|Catalan]] cultural [[Foundation (nonprofit)|foundation]] with headquarters in [[Barcelona]]. Its members, of which the most prominent is the Catalan nationalist writer [[Jordi Bilbeny]], hold that history has been systematically manipulated by the Spanish (or "Castilian") state since the 15th century to eliminate the Catalan contribution to world history. They claim that major historical figures, including [[Christopher Columbus]], [[Erasmus]], [[Miguel de Cervantes]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Teresa of Ávila|Saint Teresa of Ávila]] and others were Catalan. The institute's work has been criticised as [[pseudohistory]].

The institute promotes research, study and dissemination of ideas about Catalan influence on history through publications, conferences and symposia, in particular the annual "Symposium on the Catalan Discovery of America" in [[Arenys de Munt]]. It is funded by the [[Generalitat de Catalunya|Catalan autonomous government]], and has received support from [[Catalan nationalism|Catalan nationalist]] politicians.

The INH considers that the history of Catalonia has been manipulated and distorted since the end of the 15th century to favour the construct of a centralised Spanish ("Castilian") state. By minimising the role of Catalonia—or the [[Crown of Aragon]]—in Spanish collective history through falsification, concealment and censorship or "appropriation" of certain historical episodes, the prevalence of Castilian ideology is established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pere Forès i Malleu|first=Pere|title = Esborrant la traça catalana|magazine=Presència|location=Barcelona|number=2021|date=19 November 2010|pages=28–31|id= GI-143-1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among its claims are:

A history rewritten by the Castilians'', noting that the books published by the INH "are very convincing", while in 2014, the former vice-president of the Generalitat de Catalunya, [[Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira]], participated at the reissue of Bilbeny's ''Brief account of the destruction of history'', where he spoke in praise of the book.&lt;ref name=EC140804&gt;{{cite news|last=Fernández|first=A.|title=Jordi Pujol y Carod se suman a la teoría de que Colón y los Pinzón eran catalanes|url=http://www.elconfidencial.com/espana/cataluna/2014-07-03/jordi-pujol-y-carod-se-suman-a-la-teoria-de-que-colon-y-los-pinzon-eran-catalanes_155815/|work=El Confidencial|date=3 July 2014|language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2015 INH symposium in [[Arenys de Munt]], under the title "The Catalan Discovery of America", was financed by the councils of Arenys de Munt and [[Arenys de Mar]], together with associations such as the {{lang|ca|Ateneu Independentista}} of Arenys de Munt.

==Criticism==
The INH has been described by one academic as "a group of Catalan self-styled scholars trying to prove and promote the idea that, throughout History, a massive conspiracy by the Crown of Castille, the Inquisition, and any institution that may be related to Castille, has been orchestrated against the nation of Catalonia to deprive it of its History and cultural identity in order to promote Castile".&lt;ref name=Rodríguez&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rodríguez López-Abadía |first=Arturo |date=2014 |title=The origins of Christopher Columbus, a never-ending controversy |url=https://www.academia.edu/9952462/The_origins_of_Christopher_Columbus_a_never-ending_controversy |journal=Revista Internacional Digilec|volume=Vol. 1|number=1|pages=1 to 10 |issn=2386-6691|access-date=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was criticised in the Catalan parliament by the opposition party [[Citizens (Spanish political party)|Ciudadanos]] spokeswoman, Carina Mejías, who described its theories as "ridiculous".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sallés|first=Quico|title = C's: «És ridícul dir que Cristòfol Colom és català»|url=http://www.naciodigital.cat/noticia/67614/es/ridicul/dir/cristofol/colom/catala|work= NacióDigital.cat|date =22 April 2014|language=Catalan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Javier Barraycoa, vice-chancellor of the [[Abat Oliba CEU University]], former secretary of the {{ill|Carlist Traditionalist Communion|ca|Comunió Tradicionalista Carlista}} in Catalonia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Directorio General de la Comunión Tradicionalista Carlista|url=http://www.carlistas.es/descargas/organigrama.pdf|website=Comunión Tradicionalista Carlista| language=Spanish|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and member of the anti-Catalanist organisation [[Somatemps]], said that the INH "has absolutely no recognition in the academic world" and that its members "have not been invited to any serious congress because it is impossible for them to defend these things."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Moreno|first=Rosalina|title=Barraycoa: ‘Cataluña vive un delirio colectivo’|url=http://www.gaceta.es/noticias/cataluna-vive-delirio-colectivo-10072014-1128|work=La Gaceta |date=10 July 2014|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joan Kent Dillon''' (30 April 1925 – 18 January 2009) was a teacher, a nationally known [[historic preservation]] activist and an author.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Joan Kent was born 30 April 1925 in Lafayette, Indiana, to Gladys and Richard Kent of Tuxedo Park, New York.&lt;ref name="GlobeObit"&gt;{{cite news |last=Negri |first=Gloria |date=16 March 2009 |title=Joan Kent Dillon, at 83; Was Theater Preservation Activist |url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/obituaries/articles/2009/03/16/joan_kent_dillon_at_83_was_theater_preservation_activist/ |newspaper=Boston Globe |location=Boston, Mass. |publisher=Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC |accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CCTObit"&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Obituaries: Joan Kent Dillon, 83 |url=http://www.capecodonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090129/OBITS02/901290337 |newspaper=Cape Cod Times |location=Hyannis, Mass. |publisher=Local Media Group, Inc. |date=29 January 2009 |accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She grew up in St. Louis, Missouri, spending summers at the family's summer home in Whalewalk Farm, [[Orleans, Massachusetts]]. She attended [[Wheeler School]] in Providence, Rhode Island but graduated from [[Mary Institute and St. Louis Country Day School|Mary Institute]] in St. Louis in 1943.  Dillon earned a Bachelor of Arts from [[Smith College]] in 1947. Her husband-to-be, George Chaffee Dillon of Liberty, Missouri, had served in the Navy during the Second World War, rising to the rank of Lt. Commander, then receiving an MBA from Harvard Business School. They met in Cambridge and married on 11 September 1948. That same year the couple moved to Kansas City, Missouri where George went to work first for J. Bruening &amp; Co. then Butler Manufacturing in 1949, eventually becoming president and chairman of the board.&lt;ref name="GeorgeObit"&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Obituary: George C.

Joan Dillon went on to complete a Masters Degree in Medieval History at the [[University of Missouri]] in 1969 with a thesis on Medieval architecture.&lt;ref name="GlobeObit" /&gt; From 1962 to 1971 she taught Ancient and Medieval History at Sunset Hill School (now [[The Pembroke Hill School]]).

===The Folly Theater===
[[File:Folly Theater burlesk.jpg|thumb|280p|right|The [[Folly Theater]] in 1973 as a burlesque house, 300 W. 12th St., Kansas City, Missouri, as documented by the [[Heritage Documentation Programs|Historic American Buildings Survey]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://loc.gov/pictures/item/mo0438/ |title=Standard Theatre, 300 West Twelfth Street, Kansas City, Jackson County, MO |date= |series=Historic American Buildings Survey |publisher=Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division, Washington, D.C. |accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[Folly Theater]] is a historic theater in Kansas City, Missouri. It originally opened as the Standard Theater on 23 September 1900 and featured on the burlesque and vaudeville circuit.  Business started declining in 1928 and the theater was closed between 1932 and 1941. The theater began showing adult movies in 1969 but continued to physically decline. The balcony had been closed by the fire marshall in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021028192142/http://www.follytheater.com/history_restoration.html |archive-date= 28 October 2002 |url=http://www.follytheater.org/history_restoration.html |deadurl=yes |title=Folly Theater History: Restoration / Renovation (1974-November 1981) |author= |website=Folly Theater |accessdate=22 August 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The theater again closed in January 1974.  The theater's then owners, Annbar Associates and Elk Realty of New York, announced that if a buyer could not be identified by the end of the year, the theater would be demolished to make way for a parking lot.&lt;ref name="APReprieve"&gt;{{cite news |last=Associated Press |date=February 15, 1975 |title=Historic Showhouse Gets Reprieve |newspaper=The Evening Standard |location=Uniontown, Penn. |publisher=Uniontown Newspapers, Inc. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of local historic preservation activists, including Dillon and [[William N. Deramus III]], formed the nonprofit Performing Arts Foundation, to raise the money to purchase and restore the theater. The theater was offered for sale for $950,000. The Performing Arts Foundation raised $350,000 in contributions and through negotiation convinced Annbar Associates to offer the remaining $600,000 of the purchase price as a donation.&lt;ref name="APReprieve" /&gt;

Folly Theater was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Jackson County, Missouri: Downtown Kansas City|National Register of Historic Places]] in 1974.

But preventing the building from being demolished was just the beginning. The building was in a considerable state of disrepair. Most of the windows were broken. A chandelier had fallen onto the balcony. Pornographic magazines rotted in closets. Nineteen tones of pigeon dung would be removed from the building. Between 1974 and 1987 Dillon and the Performing Arts Foundation raised $5 million for the restoration of the theater, including a $1 million grant from the Department of Housing and Urban Development.  The theater was reopened in 1981. A plaque was mounted on the stage recognizing Joan Dillon's work in saving the Folly Theater. A pair of plaster pigeons installed above the box office by architect Bob Berkebile are named Joan and George after the Dillons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/1439 |title=Folly Theater |last1=Francis |first1=Donna |website=Cinema Treasures |accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A national role===
Her work saving and restoring the Folly Theater made Dillon a nationally known historic preservation advocate. She became a board member of the [[The Broadway League|League of Historic American Theaters]] from 1978-1981 and 1992-1998, the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] from 1980-1990, President Reagan's [[President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities|Committee on the Arts and Humanities]] from 1982-1990 and the Smithsonian National Board from 1989-1995.&lt;ref name="StarObit"&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Obituary: Joan Dillon |newspaper=Kansas City Star |location=Hyannis, Mass. |publisher=Local Media Group, Inc. |date=28 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her board and committee work required frequent travel to Washington, D.C.

===''American Theaters''===
For a number of years Dillon had been thinking about a book documenting America's nineteenth century historic theaters.  Through her work on historic preservation, Dillon met architectural historian [[David Arthur Naylor (architectural historian)|David Naylor]]. Naylor had already produced two books on movie theaters, ''American Picture Palaces: The Architecture of Fantasy'' (1981) and ''Great American Movie Theaters'' (1987),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sah.org/about-sah/sah-news/2013/03/01/obituary-david-naylor |title=Obituary: David Naylor |last1=Maddex |first1=Diane |date=1 March 2013 |website=Society of Architectural Historians |accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and during the years 1994-1996 the two worked together on Dillon's idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hdl.handle.net/1903.1/1344 |title=Joan Dillon papers, |last1=Curtis |first1=Peter |last2=Archer |first2=Joanne |date=October 2003 |publisher=University of Maryland Libraries |accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They began by contacting one thousand five hundred theaters by telephone and postcard. They then sent a follow-up questionnaire to more than a thousand from the first list. The two then traveled extensively with one or both Dillon and Naylor eventual visiting two hundred and fifty theaters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dillon |first=Joan |last2=Naylor |first2=David |date=1997 |title=American Theaters: Performance Halls of the Nineteenth Century |location=New York |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |isbn=0-471-14393-6 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the two arrived upon a list of forty theaters, arranged into seven broad categories, they deemed representative of the breadth of American nineteenth century theaters (see [[Joan Dillon (historic preservation activist)#American Theaters 2|next section]] for detail on their list and categories). The record of their survey, ''American Theaters: Performance Halls of the Nineteenth Century'', was published in 1997.

===Later life===
Throughout her life Dillon continued to spend summers in Cape Cod. In 1976 she bought a home in North Chatham, Massachusetts. Dillon continued her historic preservation activities in the Cape Cod region. She worked in Acquisitions for the [[Cape Cod Museum of Art]] from 2007-2009.&lt;ref name="StarObit" /&gt; In 2007 she published ''Barns of Cape Cod'' with her son, Kent C. Dillon and photographer Blandon Belushin.&lt;ref name="barns"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dillon |first=Joan |last2=Dillon |first2=Kent C. |last3=Belushin |first3=Blandon |date=2007 |title=Barns of Cape Cod |location=Atglen, Penn. |publisher=Schiffer Publishing, Ltd. |isbn=9780764325649}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the last ten years of her life she lived in Cape Cod permanently&lt;ref name="CCTObit" /&gt; and it was in her home there that Joan Dillon died at the age of 83 of leukemia and cardiac arrest on 18 January 2009.

==American Theaters==
After a brief historical essay, the bulk of the book consists of the section, "A Revue of Nineteenth Century American Theaters." From the thousands of initially identified theaters, the forty that Dillon and Naylor selected as exemplary of nineteenth century theaters are the following.

'''Julian day''' is the continuous count of days since the beginning of the Julian Period and is used primarily by [[Astronomy|astronomers]], and in [[software]] for easily calculating elapsed days between two events (e.g. food production date and sell by date)&lt;ref&gt;"Julian date" n.d.&lt;/ref&gt;.

The '''Julian Day Number '''('''JDN''') is the integer assigned to a whole solar day in the Julian day count starting from noon [[Universal time]], with Julian day number 0 assigned to the day starting at noon on Monday, January 1, [[4713 BC|4713&amp;nbsp;BC]], [[proleptic Julian calendar]] (November 24, 4714&amp;nbsp;BC, in the [[proleptic Gregorian calendar]]),&lt;ref&gt;Dershowitz &amp; Reingold 2008, 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seidelman 2013, 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Astronomical Almanac Online" 2016, Glossary, s.v. Julian date. Various timescales may be used with Julian date, such as [[Terrestrial Time]] (TT) or Universal Time (UT); in precise work the timescale should be specified.&lt;/ref&gt;  a date at which three multi-year cycles started (which are: [[Indiction]], [[Solar cycle (calendar)|Solar]], and [[Metonic cycle|Lunar]] cycles) and which preceded any dates in recorded history.&lt;ref&gt;Both of these dates are years of the Christian or [[Common Era]] (which has no year 0 between 1 BC and AD 1). Astronomical calculations generally include a year 0, so these dates should be adjusted accordingly (i.e. the year 4713 BC becomes [[Astronomical year numbering|astronomical year number]] &amp;minus;4712, etc.). In this article, dates before October 15, 1582 are in the (possibly proleptic) Julian calendar and dates on or after October 15, 1582 are in the Gregorian calendar, unless otherwise labelled.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Julian day number for the day starting at 12:00 [[Universal Time|UT]] on January 1, 2000, was 2&amp;nbsp;451&amp;nbsp;545.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy &amp; Guinot 2013, 91–2&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Julian date''' ('''JD''') of any instant is the Julian day number plus the fraction of a day since the preceding noon in Universal Time. Julian dates are expressed as a Julian day number with a decimal fraction added.&lt;ref name="IAU"&gt;"Resolution B1" 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Julian Date for 00:30:00.0 UT January 1, 2013, is 2&amp;nbsp;456&amp;nbsp;293.520&amp;nbsp;833.&lt;ref&gt;US Naval Observatory 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Julian Period''' is a [[Chronology|chronological]] interval of 7980 years; year 1 of the Julian Period was 4713&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;''Astronomical Almanac for the year 2017'' p. B4, which states 2017 is year 6730 of the Julian Period.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been used by [[History|historians]] since its introduction in 1583 to convert between different [[calendar]]s. The Julian calendar year {{CURRENTYEAR}} is year {{#expr: {{CURRENTYEAR}} + 4713 }} of the  current Julian Period. The next Julian Period begins in the year AD&amp;nbsp;3268.

== Terminology ==
The term ''Julian date'' may also refer, outside of astronomy, to the day-of-year number (more properly, the [[ordinal date]]) in the [[Gregorian calendar]], especially in computer programming, the military and the food industry,&lt;ref name="usda"&gt;USDA c. 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; or it may refer to dates in the [[Julian calendar]]. For example, if a given "Julian date" is "October 5, 1582", this means that date in the Julian calendar (which was October 15, 1582, in the Gregorian calendar—the date it was first established).  Without an astronomical or historical context, a "Julian date" given as "36" most likely means the 36th day of a given Gregorian year, namely February 5.  Other possible meanings of a "Julian date" of "36" include an astronomical Julian Day Number, or the year AD&amp;nbsp;36 in the Julian calendar, or a duration of 36&amp;nbsp;astronomical [[Julian year (astronomy)|Julian years]]).  This is why the terms "ordinal date" or "day-of-year" are preferred.  In contexts where a "Julian date" means simply an ordinal date, calendars of a Gregorian year with formatting for ordinal dates are often called ''"Julian calendars"'',&lt;ref name="usda"/&gt; but this could also mean that the calendars are of years in the Julian calendar system.

Historical Julian dates were recorded relative to GMT or [[Ephemeris Time]], but the [[International Astronomical Union]] now recommends that Julian dates be specified in [[Terrestrial Time]], and that when necessary to specify Julian dates using a different time scale, that the time scale used be indicated when required, such as JD(UT1). The fraction of the day is found by converting the number of hours, minutes, and seconds after noon into the equivalent decimal fraction.  Time intervals calculated from differences of Julian Dates specified in non-uniform time scales, such as [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC), may need to be corrected for changes in time scales (e.g. [[leap second]]s).&lt;ref name="IAU" /&gt;

== Variants ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Epoch (reference date)]] --&gt;
Because the starting point or [[Epoch (reference date)|reference epoch]] is so long ago, numbers in the Julian day can be quite large and cumbersome. A more recent starting point is sometimes used, for instance by dropping the leading digits, in order to fit into limited computer memory with an adequate amount of precision. In the following table, times are given in 24-hour notation.

In the table below, ''Epoch'' refers to the point in time used to set the origin (usually zero, but (1) where explicitly indicated) of the alternative convention being discussed in that row. The date given is a Gregorian calendar date if it is October 15, 1582, or later, but a Julian calendar date if it is earlier.  JD stands for Julian Date. 0h is 00:00 midnight, 12h is 12:00 noon, UT unless otherwise specified. Current value is as of {{CURRENTDATE}} and may be cached.

* The '''Modified Julian Date''' (MJD) was introduced by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in 1957 to record the orbit of [[Sputnik 1|Sputnik]] via an [[IBM 704]] (36-bit machine) and using only 18 bits until August 7, 2576. MJD is the epoch of VAX/VMS and its successor [[OpenVMS#Timekeeping|OpenVMS]], using 63-bit date/time, which allows times to be stored up to July 31, 31086, 02:48:05.47.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vms.tuwien.ac.at/info/humour/vms-base-time-origin.txt|title=Wayback Machine|date=June 6, 2007|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070606064704/http://vms.tuwien.ac.at/info/humour/vms-base-time-origin.txt|archivedate=June 6, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MJD has a starting point of midnight on November 17, 1858 and is computed by MJD = JD - 2400000.5 &lt;ref&gt;Winkler n. d.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''Truncated Julian Day''' (TJD) was introduced by [[NASA]]/[[Goddard Space Flight Center|Goddard]] in 1979 as part of a parallel grouped binary time code (PB-5) "designed specifically, although not exclusively, for spacecraft applications." TJD was a 4-digit day count from MJD 40000, which was May 24, 1968, represented as a 14-bit binary number.  Since this code was limited to four digits, TJD recycled to zero on MJD 50000, or October 10, 1995, "which gives a long ambiguity period of 27.4 years". (NASA codes PB-1—PB-4 used a 3-digit day-of-year count.) Only whole days are represented.  Time of day is expressed by a count of seconds of a day, plus optional milliseconds, microseconds and nanoseconds in separate fields.  Later PB-5J was introduced which increased the TJD field to 16 bits, allowing values up to 65535, which will occur in the year 2147.  There are five digits recorded after TJD 9999.&lt;ref&gt;Chi 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;SPD Toolkit Time Notes 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''Dublin Julian Date''' (DJD) is the number of days that has elapsed since the epoch of the solar and lunar [[ephemerides]] used from 1900 through 1983, [[Newcomb's Tables of the Sun]] and [[Ernest W. Brown]]'s ''Tables of the Motion of the Moon'' (1919). This epoch was noon UT on [[:January 0]], 1900, which is the same as noon UT on December 31, 1899. The DJD was defined by the International Astronomical Union at their meeting in [[Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;Ransom c. 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

The original paper defining it makes no mention of the time zone, and no mention of time-of-day.&lt;ref&gt;Ohms 1986&lt;/ref&gt; It was named for [[Aloysius Lilius]], the principal author of the Gregorian calendar.&lt;ref&gt;IBM 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some implementations or options use [[Universal Time]], others use local time. Day 1 is January 1, 1, that is, the first day of the [[Christian Era|Christian]] or [[Common Era]] in the [[proleptic Gregorian calendar]].&lt;ref&gt;Dershowitz &amp; Reingold 2008, 10, 351, 353, Appendix B.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Heliocentric Julian Day]] (HJD) is the same as the Julian day, but adjusted to the frame of reference of the [[Sun]], and thus can differ from the Julian day by as much as 8.3 minutes (498 seconds), that being the time it takes the Sun's light to reach [[Earth]].

To illustrate the ambiguity that could arise, consider the two separate astronomical measurements of an astronomical object from the earth: Assume that three objects—the Earth, the Sun, and the astronomical object targeted, that is whose distance is to be measured—happen to be in a straight line for both measures. However, for the first measurement, the Earth is between the Sun and the targeted object, and for the second, the Earth is on the opposite side of the Sun from that object. Then, the two measurements would differ by about 1000 light-seconds: For the first measurement, the Earth is roughly 500 light seconds closer to the target than the Sun, and roughly 500 light seconds further from the target astronomical object than the Sun for the second measure.

An error of about 1000 light-seconds is over 1% of a light-day, which can be a significant error when measuring temporal phenomena for short period astronomical objects over long time intervals. To clarify this issue, the ordinary Julian day is sometimes referred to as the '''Geocentric Julian Day''' (GJD) in order to distinguish it from HJD.

== History ==
The ''Julian day number'' is based on the ''Julian Period'' proposed by [[Joseph Justus Scaliger|Joseph Scaliger]], a classical scholar, in 1583, at the time of the Gregorian calendar reform, as it is the [[least common multiple]] of three calendar cycles used with the Julian calendar:

: 15 ([[indiction|indiction cycle]]) × 19 ([[Metonic cycle]]) × 28 ([[Solar cycle (calendar)|Solar cycle]]) = 7980 years

Its epoch falls at the last time when all three cycles (if they are continued backward far enough) were in their first year together &amp;mdash; Scaliger chose this because it preceded all historical dates. Years of the Julian Period are counted from this year, 4713 BC, which was chosen to be before any historical record.&lt;ref&gt;Richards 2013, pp. 591-592.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Since it is now certain that every possible combination of the three cyclic numbers finds its place in the Julian Period, it is evident that the first year of the Christian era, which was the 10th year of a Solar Cycle, the 2nd of a Lunar Cycle, and the 4th of a Cycle of Indiction, finds its place within this artificial era, and must answer to that particular year of the period which is characterized by the same cyclic numbers.   Hence, to refer the Christian era to the Julian Period is the same thing as to find out what year of that period it is which, when divided by 28 will leave a remainder 10, divided by 19 will leave a remainder 2, and divided by 15 will leave a remainder 4.   The solution of this problem belongs to the higher mathematics, by which it is found that the year required is the 4714th of the period in question.   Hence Jul. Per. 4714=A.D.1, and consequently Julian Period 4713=B.C.1.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Smith &amp; ben Uziel 1853, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In point of fact, finding the year is a very straightforward arithmetical  procedure.   See "Calculation" below.

Although many references say that the ''Julian'' in "Julian Period" refers to Scaliger's father, [[Julius Caesar Scaliger|Julius Scaliger]], in the introduction to Book V of his ''{{lang|la|Opus de Emendatione Temporum}}'' ("Work on the Emendation of Time") he states, "''{{lang|la|Iulianam vocauimus: quia ad annum Iulianum dumtaxat accomodata est}}''", which translates more or less as "We have called it Julian merely because it is accommodated to the Julian year." Thus ''Julian'' refers to [[Julius Caesar]], who introduced the Julian calendar in 46 BC.

Originally the Julian Period was used only to count years, and the Julian calendar was used to express historical dates within years.  In his book ''Outlines of Astronomy'', first published in 1849, the astronomer [[John Herschel]] added the counting of days elapsed from the beginning of the Julian Period:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The period thus arising of 7980 Julian years, is called the Julian period, and it has been found so useful, that the most competent authorities have not hesitated to declare that, through its employment, light and order were first introduced into chronology.&lt;ref&gt;Ideler 1825, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;   We owe its invention or revival to Joseph Scaliger, who is said to have received it from the Greeks of Constantinople. The first year of the current Julian period, or that of which the number in each of the three subordinate cycles is 1, was the year 4713 BC, and the noon of the 1st of January of that year, for the meridian of Alexandria, is the chronological epoch, to which all historical eras are most readily and intelligibly referred, by computing the number of integer days intervening between that epoch and the noon (for Alexandria) of the day, which is reckoned to be the first of the particular era in question. The meridian of Alexandria is chosen as that to which Ptolemy refers the commencement of the era of Nabonassar, the basis of all his calculations.&lt;ref&gt;Herschel 1858, p. 678&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Astronomer]]s adopted Herschel's "days of the Julian period" in the late nineteenth century, but used the meridian of Greenwich instead of Alexandria, after the former was adopted as the [[Prime Meridian]] after the [[International Meridian Conference]] in Washington in 1884. This has now become the standard system of Julian days numbers.

The French mathematician and astronomer [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] first expressed the time of day as a decimal fraction added to calendar dates in his book, ''{{lang|fr|Traité de Mécanique Céleste}}'', in 1799.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QjEVAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA348 Laplace] 1799, p.349&lt;/ref&gt; Other astronomers added fractions of the day to the Julian day number to create Julian Dates, which are typically used by astronomers to date [[astronomy|astronomical]] observations, thus eliminating the complications resulting from using standard calendar periods like eras, years, or months. They were first introduced into [[variable star]] work by [[Edward Charles Pickering]], of the [[Harvard College Observatory]], in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5jQJAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=toc#PPA206,M1 Furness] 1988, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

Julian days begin at noon because when Herschel recommended them, the [[astronomical day]] began at noon. The astronomical day had begun at noon ever since [[Ptolemy]] chose to begin the days in his astronomical periods at noon. He chose noon because the transit of the Sun across the observer's meridian occurs at the same apparent time every day of the year, unlike sunrise or sunset, which vary by several hours. Midnight was not even considered because it could not be accurately determined using [[water clock]]s. Nevertheless, he double-dated most nighttime observations with both [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] days beginning at sunrise and [[Babylonia]]n days beginning at sunset. This would seem to imply that his choice of noon was ''not'', as is sometimes stated, made in order to allow all observations from a given night to be recorded with the same date. When this practice ended in 1925, it was decided to keep Julian days continuous with previous practice.

== Julian day number calculation ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Gregorian calendar]] --&gt;
The Julian day number can be calculated using the following formulas ('''[[integer division]] is used exclusively''', that is, the remainders of all divisions are '''dropped'''):

''The months January to December are numbered 1 to 12. For the year, [[astronomical year numbering]] is used, thus 1 BC is 0, 2 BC is −1, and 4713 BC is −4712. ''JDN'' is the Julian Day Number. Use the previous day of the month if trying to find the JDN of an instant before midday UT.''

===Converting Gregorian calendar date to Julian Day Number===
The algorithm&lt;ref&gt;L. E. Doggett, Ch. 12, "Calendars", p. 604, in Seidelmann 1992&lt;/ref&gt; is valid for all (possibly [[Proleptic Gregorian calendar|proleptic]]) Gregorian calendar dates after November 23, &amp;minus;4713.

JDN = (1461 × (Y + 4800 + (M − 14)/12))/4 +(367 × (M − 2 − 12 × ((M − 14)/12)))/12 − (3 × ((Y + 4900 + (M - 14)/12)/100))/4 + D − 32075

===Converting Julian calendar date to Julian Day Number===
The algorithm&lt;ref&gt;L. E. Doggett, Ch. 12, "Calendars", p. 606, in Seidelmann 1992&lt;/ref&gt; is valid for all (possibly [[Proleptic Julian calendar|proleptic]]) Julian calendar years ≥ −4712, that is, for all JDN ≥ 0.

JDN = 367 × Y − (7 × (Y + 5001 + (M − 9)/7))/4 + (275 × M)/9 + D + 1729777

=== Finding Julian date given Julian day number and time of day ===
For the full Julian Date of a moment after 12:00 UT one can use the following (divisions are real numbers):

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}J\!D &amp; = &amp; J\!D\!N + \frac{\text{hour} - 12}{24} + \frac{\text{minute}}{1440} + \frac{\text{second}}{86400}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

So, for example, January 1, 2000, at 18:00:00 UT corresponds to ''JD'' = 2451545.25

For a point in time in a given Julian day after midnight UT and before 12:00 UT, add 1 or use the JDN of the next afternoon.

=== Finding day of week given Julian day number ===
The US day of the [[week]] '''W1''' (for an afternoon or evening UT) can be determined from the Julian Day Number '''J''' with the expression:
: '''W1''' = [[Modular arithmetic|mod]](''J'' + 1, 7)&lt;ref&gt;Richards 2013, pp. 592, 618.&lt;/ref&gt;

{|border="1" class="wikitable"
|-style="text-align:center;"
!'''W1'''
| 0 || 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6
|-
!'''Day of the week'''
|Sun||Mon||Tue||Wed||Thu||Fri||Sat
|}

If the moment in time is after midnight UT (and before 12:00 UT), then one is already in the next day of the week.

The ISO day of the week '''W0''' can be determined from the Julian Day Number '''J''' with the expression:
: '''W0''' = mod (''J'', 7) + 1

{|border="1" class="wikitable"

|Mon||Tue||Wed||Thu||Fri||Sat||Sun
|}

=== Julian or Gregorian calendar from Julian day number ===
This is an algorithm by Richards to convert a Julian Day Number, '''J''',  to a date in the Gregorian calendar (proleptic, when applicable). Richards states the algorithm is valid for Julian day numbers greater than or equal to 0.&lt;ref&gt;Richards 2013, 617–9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richards 1998, 316&lt;/ref&gt; All variables are integer values, and the notation "''a''&amp;nbsp;div&amp;nbsp;''b''" indicates [[integer division]], and "mod(''a'',''b'')" denotes the [[Modular arithmetic|modulus operator]].

For Julian calendar:
:1. ''f'' =  '''J''' + ''j''
For Gregorian calendar:
:1. ''f'' =  '''J''' + ''j'' + (((4 × '''J''' + ''B'') div 146097) × 3) div 4 + ''C''
For Julian or Gregorian, continue:
:2. ''e'' = ''r'' × ''f'' + ''v''
:3. ''g'' = mod(''e'', ''p'') div ''r''
:4. ''h'' = ''u'' × ''g'' + ''w''
:5. '''D''' = (mod(''h, s'')) div ''u'' + 1
:6. '''M''' = mod(''h'' div ''s'' + ''m'', ''n'') + 1
:7. '''Y''' = (''e'' div ''p'') - ''y'' + (''n'' + ''m'' - '''M''') div ''n''

'''D''', '''M''', and '''Y''' are the numbers of the day, month, and year respectively for the afternoon at the beginning of the given Julian day.

=== Julian Period from indiction, Metonic and solar cycles ===

Let Y be the year BC or AD and i, m and s respectively its positions in the indiction, Metonic and solar cycles.
Divide 6916i + 4200m + 4845s by 7980 and call the remainder r.
:If r&gt;4713, Y = (r − 4713) and is a year AD.
:If r&lt;4714, Y = (4714 − r) and is a year BC.

'''Example'''

i = 8, m = 2, s = 8.   What is the year?

:(6916 × 8) = 55328; (4200 × 2) = 8400: (4845 × 8) = 38760.   55328 + 8400 + 38760 = 102488.
:102488/7980 = 12 remainder 6728.
:Y = (6728 − 4713) = AD 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Heath 1760, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Julian date calculation==
As stated above, the Julian date (JD) of any instant is the Julian day number for the preceding noon in Universal Time plus the fraction of the day since that instant. Ordinarily calculating the fractional portion of the JD is straightforward; the number of seconds that have elapsed in the day divided by the number of seconds in a day, 86,400. But if the UTC timescale is being used, a day containing a positive leap second contains 86,401 seconds (or in the unlikely event of a negative leap second, 86,399 seconds). One authoritative source, the [[SOFA (astronomy)|Standards of Fundamental Astronomy]] (SOFA), deals with this issue by treating days containing a leap second as having a different length (86,401 or 86,399 seconds, as required). SOFA refers to the result of such a calculation as "quasi-JD".&lt;ref&gt;"SOFA Time Scale and Calendar Tools" 2016, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Life of Sethos, Taken from Private Memoirs of the Ancient Egyptians''''' ({{lang-fr|Séthos, histoire, ou Vie tirée des monumens, anecdotes de l'ancienne Égypte, traduite d'un manuscrit grec}}) is an influential [[fantasy novel]] originally published in six volumes at Paris in 1731 by the French ''[[abbé]]'' [[Jean Terrasson]]. An English translation by [[Thomas Lediard]] published at London by J. Walthoe appeared in 1732.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Lediard, Thomas|volume=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to classicist [[Mary Lefkowitz]], Sethos:
{{quotation|''purports to be a translation of an ancient manuscript found in the library of an unnamed foreign nation that is "extremely jealous of this sort of treasure." The author is said to have been an anonymous Greek in the second century A.D. Here Terrasson is following the conventions of ancient writers of historical fictions, such as the author of the Hermetica, who pretend that their works are translations of ancient writings that no one but themselves has seen. But Terrasson is careful not to deceive his readers completely: he assures them that the work he has "translated" for them is a fiction; .... He assures them that although fictional, the story keeps close to ancient sources, which, for the reader's convenience, he cites throughout the text. But he also says that "it is natural to suppose" that his author had access to original sources (now lost), such as memoirs available in the sacred archives of Egypt, written by unknown priests who accompanied Sethos on his travels. The sophisticated reader would be amused by the notion that the anonymous author had consulted these otherwise unknown documents, but Terrasson gives no warning to less well-educated readers that there is in fact no reason to "suppose" that these documents ever existed.''&lt;ref&gt;Lefkowitz, Mary, ''Not Out of Africa: How Afrocentrist Became an Excuse to Teach Myth as History,'' New York, BasicBooks, 1996, pp. 111-12&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This eighteenth century work of fiction is a primary source of [[Afrocentrism]] and of the kind of black history found in such popular books as [[Martin Bernal]]'s ''[[Black Athena|Black Athena: The Afroasiatic Roots of Classical Civilization]]''&lt;ref&gt;Mary R. Lefkowitz, Guy MacLean Rogers (eds.), ''Black Athena Revisited'', UNC Press Books, 1996, p. 358.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[George James (writer)|George James]]'s ''Stolen Legacy: Greek Philosophy Is Stolen Egyptian Philosophy''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,984143,00.html?iid=digg_share BOOKS ATTACKING AFROCENTRISM], [[John Elson]], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', Feb. 19, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also a key source of a popular web of conspiracy theories positing a secret pagan subculture of [[Freemasons]], devotees of Satan, and environmentalists dedicated to the overthrow of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/3122/ Great Awful Books], Charles Paul Freund,  Oct. 17, 1996, Slate&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Greek historian [[Herodotus]] in his ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' (book II, chapter 141) writes of a [[High Priest of Ptah]] named Sethos ({{lang-grc-gre|Σεθῶν}} ''Sethon'') who became pharaoh and defeated the Assyrians with divine intervention. This name is probably a corruption of [[Shebitku]] (or Shabataka), the actual pharaoh at the time, who was a [[Kushite]] of the [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert B. Strassler (ed.), ''The Landmark Herodotus: The Histories'' (Anchor, 2007), p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alan B. Lloyd, Commentary on Book II, in ''A Commentary on Herodotus, Books I–IV'' (Oxford University Press, 2007), p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Herodotus:
{{quotation|''After him there came to the throne the priest of [[Hephaistos]], whose name was Sethos. This man, they said, neglected and held in no regard the warrior class of the Egyptians, considering that he would have no need of them; and besides other slights which he put upon them, he also took from them the yokes of corn-land 125 which had been given to them as a special gift in the reigns of the former kings, twelve yokes to each man. After this, Sanacharib king of the Arabians and of the Assyrians marched a great host against Egypt. Then the warriors of the Egyptians refused to come to the rescue, and the priest, being driven into a strait, entered into the sanctuary of the temple 126 and bewailed to the image of the god the danger which was impending over him; and as he was thus lamenting, sleep came upon him, and it seemed to him in his vision that the god came and stood by him and encouraged him, saying that he should suffer no evil if he went forth to meet the army of the Arabians; for he himself would send him helpers. Trusting in these things seen in sleep, he took with him, they said, those of the Egyptians who were willing to follow him, and encamped in Pelusion, for by this way the invasion came: and not one of the warrior class followed him, but shop-keepers and artisans and men of the market. Then after they came, there swarmed by night upon their enemies mice of the fields, and ate up their quivers and their bows, and moreover the handles of their shields, so that on the next day they fled, and being without defence of arms great numbers fell. And at the present time this king stands in the temple of Hephaistos in stone, holding upon his hand a mouse, and by letters inscribed he says these words: "Let him who looks upon me learn to fear the gods".''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2707/2707-8.txt ''The Histories of Herodotus], II:141 (Euterpe) by Herodotus (1890)&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37223">This '''list of preserved historic blast furnaces''' contains decommissioned [[blast furnace]]s, of which substantial remains survive. The furnaces are preserved in a [[park]] or museum, or as a site otherwise open to visitors, or intended to become such.

While pre-20th-century blast furnaces already have a long history of monument preservation, the perception of 20th century mass production blast furnace installations as [[industrial heritage]] is a comparably new trend. For a long time, it has been normal procedure for such a blast furnace to be demolished after being decommissioned and either be replaced with a newer, improved one, or to have the entire site demolished to make room for follow-up use of the area. It has only been in recent years{{When|date=January 2011}} that numerous countries have realized the value of blast furnaces as a part of their [[industrial history]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Historically, the first such blast furnace not to be demolished stands in [[Starachowice]], [[Poland]] (decommissioned in 1968), followed by the last blast furnace of Yahata Steel Works in [[Yahatahigashi-ku, Kitakyūshū]], [[Japan]] (decommissioned in 1972) and the "Carrie Furnaces" in [[Homestead, Pennsylvania|Homestead]], [[Pennsylvania]] in the [[United States]] (decommissioned in 1978). One of the two blast furnaces in [[Neunkirchen, Saarland|Neunkirchen]] in [[Germany]] (decommissioned in 1982) was the first blast furnace worldwide to be not just preserved, but actively refurbished for the purpose of preservation.

For 20th-century mass production blast furnaces, the degree of accurate preservation versus integration into new structures, or even re-purposing, differs between the various sites. Colorful illumination installations at night are common.

==List of preserved industrial mass production blast furnaces around the world==
These installations all date from the 20th century. They are supported by outer frames made of metal, were supplied with pre-heated blast air from external Cowper stoves, were typically part of large industrial compounds where, at one point, multiple blast furnaces were typically standing and operating side by side for efficiency reasons, raw materials were delivered by external elevating mechanisms, and the entire site was accessible by [[Freight rail transport|freight trains]] which delivered the raw materials and carried off the freshly smelted [[pig iron]] in [[Ladle (metallurgy)|ladles]].

In many cases, the preserved sites have been deliberately stripped down to minimize maintenance costs; namely, some blast furnaces and related installations have been demolished. The goal was to only retain one or two blast furnaces including the relevant related installations (such as Cowper stoves, cast house, winch house etc.), which are considered sufficient to explain the blast furnace process and all related functions to visitors.

The first such decommissioned blast furnace that wasn't demolished and has been preserved to this very day stands in [[Starachowice]], [[Poland]], and has ceased operation as early as 1968.

{{Human history}}
'''Modernity''', a topic in the humanities and social sciences, is both a historical period (the [[modern era]]), as well as the ensemble of particular socio-cultural [[norm (social)|norms]], attitudes and practices that arose in the wake of the [[Renaissance]]{{mdash}}in the "[[Age of Reason]]" of 17th-century thought and the 18th-century "[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]". Some commentators consider the era of modernity to have ended by 1930, with [[World War II]] in 1945, or the 1980s or 1990s; the following era is called [[postmodernity]]. The term "[[contemporary history]]" is also used to refer to the post-1945 timeframe, without assigning it to either the modern or postmodern era.  (Thus "modern" may be used as a name of a particular era in the past, as opposed to meaning "the current era".)

Depending on the field, "modernity" may refer to different time periods or qualities.  In historiography, the 17th and 18th centuries are usually described as [[early modern]], while the [[long 19th century]] corresponds to "[[modern history]]" proper. While it includes a wide range of interrelated historical processes and cultural phenomena (from [[fashion]] to [[modern warfare]]), it can also refer to the subjective or existential experience of the conditions they produce, and their ongoing impact on human culture, institutions, and politics {{harv|Berman|2010|loc=15–36}}.

As an analytical concept and [[norm (philosophy)|normative]] ideal, modernity is closely linked to the [[ethos]] of philosophical and aesthetic [[modernism]]; political and intellectual currents that intersect with the Enlightenment; and subsequent developments such as [[existentialism]], [[modern art]], the formal establishment of [[social science]], and contemporaneous antithetical developments such as [[Marxism]].  It also encompasses the social relations associated with the rise of capitalism, and shifts in attitudes associated with secularisation and post-industrial [[Personal life|life]] {{harv|Berman|2010|loc=15–36}}.

In the view of [[Michel Foucault|Michel]] {{harvtxt|Foucault|1975}} (classified as a proponent of [[postmodernism]] though he himself rejected the "postmodernism" label, considering his work as a "a critical history of modernity"{{mdash}}see, e.g., {{harvnb|Call|2002|loc=65}}), "modernity" as a historical category is marked by developments such as a questioning or rejection of [[tradition]]; the prioritization of [[individualism]], [[political freedom|freedom]] and [[equality before the law|formal equality]]; faith in inevitable social, scientific and technological [[progress (history)|progress]], [[Rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]] and [[professionalization]], a movement from [[feudalism]] (or [[agrarianism]]) toward [[capitalism]] and the [[market economy]], [[industrialization]], [[urbanization]] and [[secularization]], the development of the [[nation-state]], [[representative democracy]], [[public education]] (etc.) {{harv|Foucault|1977|loc=170–77&lt;!--wrong for the Penguin edition, at any rate--&gt;}}.

In the context of [[art history]], "modernity" (''modernité'') has a more limited sense, "[[modern art]]" covering the period of c. 1860–1970. Use of the term in this sense is  attributed to [[Charles Baudelaire]], who in his 1864 essay "The Painter of Modern Life", designated the "fleeting, ephemeral experience of life in an urban metropolis", and the responsibility art has to capture that experience. In this sense, the term refers to "a particular relationship to time, one characterized by intense historical discontinuity or rupture, openness to the novelty of the future, and a heightened sensitivity to what is unique about the present" {{harv|Kompridis|2006|loc=32–59}}.

==Etymology==
The [[Late Latin]] adjective ''[[:wikt:modernus#Latin|modernus]]'', a derivation from the adverb ''[[:wikt:modo#Latin|modo]]'' "presently, just now", is attested from the 5th century, at first in the context of distinguishing the [[Ancient Roman Christianity|Christian era]] from the [[Decline of Greco-Roman paganism|pagan era]]. 
In the 6th century, [[Cassiodorus]] appears to have been the first writer to use ''modernus'' "modern" regularly to refer to his own age {{harv|O'Donnell|1979|loc=235 n9}}. 
The terms ''antiquus'' and ''modernus'' were used in a chronological sense in the [[Carolingian era]]. For example, a ''magister modernus'' referred to a contemporary scholar, as opposed to old authorities such as [[Benedict of Nursia]]. In early medieval usage, ''modernus'' referred to authorities younger than pagan antiquity and the early church fathers, but not necessarily to the present day, and could include authors several centuries old, from about the time of [[Beda]], i.e. referring to the time after the foundation of the [[Order of Saint Benedict]] and/or the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]] {{harv|Hartmann|1974|loc=passim}}.

The Latin adjective was adopted in  [[Middle French]], as ''moderne'', by the 15th century, and hence, in the early [[Tudor period]], into [[Early Modern English]].
The early modern word meant "now existing", or "pertaining to the present times", not necessarily with a positive connotation.
[[Shakespeare]] uses ''modern'' in the sense of "every-day, ordinary, commonplace".

The word entered wide usage in the context of the  late 17th-century [[quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns]] within the [[Académie française]], debating the question of "Is Modern culture superior to Classical (Græco–Roman) culture?"
In the context of this debate, the "ancients" (''anciens'') and "moderns" (''modernes'') were proponents of opposing views, the former believing that contemporary writers could do no better than imitate the genius of classical antiquity, while the latter, 
first with [[Charles Perrault]] (1687), proposed that more than a mere "[[Renaissance]]" of ancient achievements, the "[[17th-century philosophy|Age of Reason]]" had gone beyond what had been possible in the classical period. 
The term [[:wikt:modernity|modernity]], first coined in the 1620s, in this context assumed the implication of a historical epoch following the Renaissance, in which the achievements of antiquity were surpassed {{harv|Delanty| 2007}}.

==Phases&lt;!--'Phases of modernity' redirects here; section linked from 'Contemporary history'--&gt;==
Modernity has been associated with cultural and [[intellectual]] movements of 1436–1789 and extending to the 1970s or later {{harv|Toulmin|1992|loc=3–5}}.

According to [[Marshall Berman|Marshall]] {{harvtxt|Berman|1982|loc=16–17}}, modernity is periodized into three conventional phases (dubbed "Early," "Classical," and "Late," respectively, by Peter {{harvtxt|Osborne|1992|loc=25}}):

* [[Early modern period|Early modernity]]: 1500–1789 (or 1453–1789 in traditional historiography)
* Classical modernity: 1789–1900 (corresponding to the [[long 19th century]] (1789–1914) in [[Eric Hobsbawm|Hobsbawm]]'s scheme)
* Late modernity: 1900–1989

In the second phase Berman draws upon the growth of modern technologies such as the newspaper, telegraph and other forms of mass media. There was a great shift into modernization in the name of industrial capitalism. Finally in the third phase, modernist arts and individual creativity marked the beginning of a new modernist age  as it combats oppressive politics, economics as well as other social forces including mass media {{harv|Laughey|2007|loc=30}}.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}&lt;!--Citations are needed to the relevant writings of Berman, not just to a tertiary source (namely Laughey 2007).--&gt;

Some authors, such as [[Jean-François Lyotard|Lyotard]] and [[Jean Baudrillard|Baudrillard]],{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} believe that modernity ended in the mid- or late 20th century and thus have defined a period subsequent to modernity, namely [[Postmodernity]] (1930s/1950s/1990s–present). Other theorists, however, regard the period from the late 20th century to the present as merely another phase of modernity; [[Zygmunt Bauman|Zygmunt]] {{harvtxt|Bauman|1989}}{{Page needed|date=September 2014}}&lt;!--Or is this in Bauman 2000, or both?--&gt; calls this phase [[Liquid modernity|"liquid" modernity]], {{harvtxt|Giddens|1998}}{{Page needed|date=September 2014}} labels it "high" modernity (see [[High modernism]]).

==Definition==

===Political===
Politically, modernity's earliest phase starts with [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]'s works which openly rejected the medieval and Aristotelian style of analyzing politics by comparison with ideas about how things should be, in favour of realistic analysis of how things really are. He also proposed that an aim of politics is to control one's own chance or fortune, and that relying upon providence actually leads to evil. Machiavelli argued, for example, that violent divisions within political communities are unavoidable, but can also be a source of strength which lawmakers and leaders should account for and even encourage in some ways {{harv|Strauss|1987}}.

Machiavelli's recommendations were sometimes influential upon kings and princes, but eventually came to be seen as favoring free republics over monarchies {{harv|Rahe|2006|loc=1}}. Machiavelli in turn influenced [[Francis Bacon]] {{harv|Kennington|2004|loc=chapt. 4{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with specific page citation.--&gt;}}, [[Marchamont Needham]] {{harv|Rahe|2006|loc=chapt. 1{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with specific page citation.--&gt;}}, [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]] ({{harvnb|Rahe|2006|loc=chapt. 1{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with specific page citation.--&gt;}}), [[John Milton]] {{harv|Bock, Skinner, and Viroli|1990|loc=chapt. 11{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with specific page citation.--&gt;}}, [[David Hume]] {{harv|Rahe|2006|loc=chapt. 4{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with specific page citation.--&gt;}}, and many others {{harv|Strauss|1958}}.

Important modern political doctrines which stem from the new Machiavellian realism include [[Bernard Mandeville|Mandeville]]'s influential proposal that "''Private Vices by the dextrous Management of a skilful Politician may be turned into Publick Benefits''" (the last sentence of his ''[[Fable of the Bees]]''), and also the doctrine of a constitutional "[[separation of powers]]" in government, first clearly proposed by [[Montesquieu]]. Both these principles are enshrined within the [[constitution]]s of most [[modern democracy|modern democracies]]. It has been observed that while Machiavelli's realism saw a value to war and political violence, his lasting influence has been "tamed" so that useful conflict was deliberately converted as much as possible to formalized political struggles and the economic "conflict" encouraged between free, private enterprises ({{harvnb|Rahe|2006|loc=chapt. 5{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with specific page citation.--&gt;}}; {{harvnb|Mansfield|1989}}).

Starting with [[Thomas Hobbes]], attempts were made to use the methods of the new modern physical sciences, as proposed by [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]] and [[Descartes]], applied to humanity and politics {{harv|Berns|1987}}. Notable attempts to improve upon the methodological approach of Hobbes include those of [[John Locke]] {{harv|Goldwin|1987}}, [[Spinoza]] {{harv|Rosen|1987}}, [[Giambattista Vico|Giambattista]] {{harvtxt|Vico|1984|loc=xli}}, and {{harvtxt|Rousseau|1997|loc=part 1}}. [[David Hume]] made what he considered to be the first proper attempt at trying to apply Bacon's scientific method to political subjects {{harv|Hume|1896 [1739]|loc=''intro.''}}, rejecting some aspects of the approach of Hobbes.

Modernist republicanism openly influenced the foundation of republics during the [[Dutch Revolt]] (1568–1609) {{harv|Bock, Skinner, and Viroli|1990|loc=chapt. 10,12{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with inclusive pages.--&gt;}}, [[English Civil War]] (1642–1651) {{harv|Rahe|2006|loc=chapt. 1{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with inclusive page numbers.--&gt;}}, [[American Revolution]] (1775–1783) {{harv|Rahe|2006|loc=chapt. 6–11{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with inclusive page numbers.--&gt;}}, the [[French Revolution]] (1789–1799), and the Haitian revolution (1791–1804). {{harv|Orwin and Tarcov|1997|loc=chapt. 8{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with inclusive page numbers.--&gt;}}.

A second phase of modernist political thinking begins with Rousseau, who questioned the natural rationality and sociality of humanity and proposed that [[human nature]] was much more malleable than had been previously thought. By this logic, what makes a good political system or a good man is completely dependent upon the chance path a whole people has taken over history. This thought influenced the political (and aesthetic) thinking of [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Edmund Burke]] and others and led to a critical review of modernist politics. On the conservative side, Burke argued that this understanding encouraged caution and avoidance of radical change. However more ambitious movements also developed from this insight into human [[culture]], initially [[Romanticism]] and [[Historicism]], and eventually both the [[Communism]] of [[Karl Marx]], and the modern forms of [[nationalism]] inspired by the [[French Revolution]], including, in one extreme, the German [[Nazi]] movement {{harv|Orwin and Tarcov|1997|loc=chapt. 4{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with specific page citation.--&gt;}}.

On the other hand, the notion of modernity has been contested also due to its Euro-centric underpinnings. This is further aggravated by the re-emergence of non-Western powers. Yet, the contestations about modernity are also linked with Western notions of democracy, social discipline, and development {{harv|Regilme|2012|loc=96}}.

===Sociological===
[[File:Die protestantische Ethik und der 'Geist' des Kapitalismus original cover.jpg|thumb|upright|Cover of the original German edition of [[Max Weber]]'s ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'']]
In [[sociology]], a discipline that arose in direct response to the social problems of "modernity" {{harv|Harriss|2000|loc=325}}, the term most generally refers to the social conditions, processes, and discourses consequent to the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. In the most basic terms, [[Anthony Giddens]] describes modernity as

&lt;blockquote&gt;
...a shorthand term for modern society, or industrial civilization. Portrayed in more detail, it is associated with (1) a certain set of attitudes towards the world, the idea of the world as open to transformation, by human intervention; (2) a complex of economic institutions, especially industrial production and a market economy; (3) a certain range of political institutions, including the nation-state and mass democracy. Largely as a result of these characteristics, modernity is vastly more dynamic than any previous type of social order. It is a society—more technically, a complex of [[institution]]s—which, unlike any preceding culture, lives in the future, rather than the past {{harv|Giddens|1998|loc=94}}.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other writers have criticized such definitions as just being a listing of factors. They argue that modernity, contingently understood as marked by an ontological formation in dominance, needs to be defined much more fundamentally in terms of different ways of being. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The modern is thus defined by the way in which prior valences of social life ... are reconstituted through a constructivist reframing of social practices in relation to basic categories of existence common to all humans: time, space, embodiment, performance and knowledge. The word 'reconstituted' here explicitly does not mean replaced. {{harv|James|2015|loc= 51–52}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This means that modernity overlays earlier formations of traditional and customary life without necessarily replacing them.

===Cultural and philosophical===
The era of modernity is characterised socially by industrialisation and the division of labour and philosophically by "the loss of certainty, and the realization that certainty can never be established, once and for all" {{harv|Delanty|2007}}. With new social and philosophical conditions arose fundamental new challenges. Various 19th-century intellectuals, from [[Auguste Comte]] to [[Karl Marx]] to [[Sigmund Freud]], attempted to offer scientific and/or political ideologies in the wake of secularisation. Modernity may be described as the "age of ideology." {{harv|Calinescu|1987|loc=2006}}.

{{Quote|For Marx, what was the basis of modernity was the emergence of capitalism and the revolutionary bourgeoisie, which led to an unprecedented expansion of productive forces and to the creation of the world market. [[Durkheim]] tackled modernity from a different angle by following the ideas of Saint-Simon about the industrial system. Although the starting point is the same as Marx, feudal society, Durkheim emphasizes far less the rising of the bourgeoisie as a new revolutionary class and very seldom refers to capitalism as the new mode of production implemented by it. The fundamental impulse to modernity is rather industrialism accompanied by the new scientific forces. In the work of [[Max Weber]], modernity is closely associated with the processes of rationalization and disenchantment of the world. {{harv|Larraín|2000|loc=13}}}}

[[Critical theory|Critical theorists]] such as [[Theodor Adorno]] and [[Zygmunt Bauman]] propose that modernity or industrialization represents a departure from the central tenets of the Enlightenment and towards nefarious processes of [[social alienation|alienation]], such as [[commodity fetishism]] and the [[Holocaust]] ({{harvnb|Adorno|1973}}, {{Page needed|date=September 2014}}; {{harvnb|Bauman|1989}}). Contemporary sociological [[critical theory]] presents the concept of "[[rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]]" in even more negative terms than those Weber originally defined. Processes of rationalization—as progress for the sake of progress—may in many cases have what critical theory says is a negative and dehumanising effect on modern society. ({{harvnb|Adorno|1973}}, {{Page needed|date=September 2014}}; {{harvnb|Bauman|2000}})

{{Quote|Enlightenment, understood in the widest sense as the advance of thought, has always aimed at liberating human beings from fear and installing them as masters. Yet the wholly enlightened earth radiates under the sign of disaster triumphant. ({{harvnb|Adorno|1973|loc=210}})}}

{{Quote|What prompts so many commentators to speak of the 'end of history', of post-modernity, 'second modernity' and 'surmodernity', or otherwise to articulate the intuition of a radical change in the arrangement of human cohabitation and in social conditions under which life-politics is nowadays conducted, is the fact that the long effort to accelerate the speed of movement has presently reached its 'natural limit'. Power can move with the speed of the electronic signal – and so the time required for the movement of its essential ingredients has been reduced to instantaneity. For all practical purposes, power has become truly exterritorial, no longer bound, or even slowed down, by the resistance of space (the advent of cellular telephones may well serve as a symbolic 'last blow' delivered to the dependency on space: even the access to a telephone market is unnecessary for a command to be given and seen through to its effect. {{harv|Bauman|2000|loc=10}}}}

Consequent to debate about [[economic globalization]], the comparative analysis of civilizations, and the post-colonial perspective of "alternative modernities," [[Shmuel Eisenstadt]] introduced the concept of "multiple modernities" ({{harvnb|Eisenstadt|2003}}; see also {{harvnb|Delanty|2007}}). Modernity as a "plural condition" is the central concept of this sociologic approach and perspective, which broadens the definition of "modernity" from exclusively denoting Western European culture to a [[cultural relativism|culturally relativistic]] definition, thereby: "Modernity is not Westernization, and its key processes and dynamics can be found in all societies" {{harv|Delanty|2007}}.

===Secularization===
Modernity, or the Modern Age, is typically defined as a post-[[traditional]],{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} and post-[[medieval]] historical period ({{harvnb|Heidegger|1938|loc=66–67}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=QImd2ARqQPMC&amp;pg=PA66 66–67]). Central to modernity is emancipation from [[religion]], specifically the hegemony of [[Christianity]], and the consequent secularization. Modern thought repudiates the [[Judeo-Christian]] belief in the Biblical God as a mere relic of superstitious ages ({{harvnb|Fackenheim|1957|loc=272-73}}; {{harvnb|Husserl|1931}}, {{Page needed|date=February 2012}}).&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Quotation from {{harvnb|Fackenheim|1967|loc=272–73}}: {{quotation|But there does seem to be a necessary conflict between modern thought and the Biblical belief in revelation. All claims of revelation, modern science and philosophy seem agreed, must be repudiated, as mere relics of superstitious ages. ... [to a modern phylosopher] The Biblical God...was a mere myth of bygone ages.}} Quotation from {{harvnb|Husserl|1931}},{{Page needed|date=February 2012}}: {{quotation|When, with the beginning of modern times, religious belief was becoming more and more externalized as a lifeless convention, men of intellect were lifted by a new belief, their great belief in an autonomous philosophy and science.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It all started with Descartes' revolutionary [[methodic doubt]], which transformed the concept of truth in the concept of certainty, whose only guarantor is no longer God or the Church, but Man's subjective judgement ({{harvnb|Alexander|1931|loc=484-85}}; {{harvnb|Heidegger|1938}}, {{Page needed|date=September 2014}}).&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Quotation from Heidegger 1938{{Page needed|date=February 2012}}&lt;!--If this English version is taken from one of the two mentioned published translations, then that edition should be cited instead of the German one; otherwise the grammatical and spelling mistakes cannot be verified.--&gt;: {{quotation|The essence of modernity can be seen in humanity's freeing itself from the bonds of Middle Ages... Certainly the modern age has, as a consequence of the liberation of humanity, introduced subjectivism and indivisualism. ... For up to Descartes... The claim [of a self-supported, unshakable foundation of truth, in the sense of certainty] originates in that emancipation of man in which he frees himself from obligation to Christian revelational truth and Church doctrine to a legislating for himself that takes its stand upon itself.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theologians have tried to cope with their worry that Western modernism has brought the world to no longer being well-disposed towards Christianity ({{harvnb|Kilby|2004|loc=262}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=G26xfiuhCmIC&amp;pg=PA262 262]; {{harvnb|Davies|2004|loc=133}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=G26xfiuhCmIC&amp;pg=PA133 133]; {{harvnb|Cassirer|1944|loc=13–14}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=x46qiaccZLYC&amp;pg=PA14 13–14]).&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Quotation from {{harvnb|Kilby|2004|loc=262}}: {{quotation|... a cluster of issues surrounding the assessment of modernity and of the apologetic task of theology in modernity. Both men [Rahner and Balthasar] were deeply concerned with apologetics, with the question of how to present Christianity in a world which is no longer well-disposed towards it. ... both thought that modernity raised particular problems for being a believing Christian, and therefore for apologetics.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modernity aimed towards "a progressive force promising to liberate humankind from ignorance and irrationality" {{harv|Rosenau|1992|loc=5}}.

===Scientific===
{{Main|Modern science}}
In the 16th and 17th centuries, [[Copernicus]], [[Kepler]], [[Galileo]] and others developed a new approach to physics and astronomy which changed the way people came to think about many things. Copernicus presented new models of the [[solar system]] which no longer placed humanity's home, on [[Earth]], in the centre. Kepler used mathematics to discuss physics and described regularities of nature this way. Galileo actually made his famous proof of uniform acceleration in [[freefall]] using mathematics ({{harvnb|Kennington|2004|loc=chapt. 1,4{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with inclusive page numbers.--&gt;}}).

[[Francis Bacon]], especially in his ''[[Novum Organum]]'', argued for a new experimental based approach to science, which sought no knowledge of [[four causes|formal or final causes]], and was therefore [[materialism|materialist]], like the ancient philosophy of [[Democritus]] and [[Epicurus]]. But he also added a theme that science should seek to control nature for the sake of humanity, and not seek to understand it just for the sake of understanding. In both these things he was influenced by Machiavelli's earlier criticism of medieval [[Scholasticism]], and his proposal that leaders should aim to control their own fortune ({{harvnb|Kennington|2004|loc=chapt. 1,4{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with inclusive page numbers.--&gt;}}).

Influenced both by Galileo's new physics and Bacon, [[René Descartes]] argued soon afterward that [[mathematics]] and [[geometry]] provided a model of how scientific knowledge could be built up in small steps. He also argued openly that human beings themselves could be understood as complex machines ({{harvnb|Kennington|2004|loc=chapt. 6{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with inclusive page numbers.--&gt;}}).

[[Isaac Newton]], influenced by Descartes, but also, like Bacon, a proponent of experimentation, provided the archetypal example of how both [[Cartesianism|Cartesian]] [[mathematics]], [[geometry]] and [[theory|theoretical]] [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]] on the one hand, and [[Baconian method|Baconian]] [[scientific method|experimental observation]] and [[Inductive reasoning|induction]] on the other hand, together could lead to great advances in the practical understanding of regularities in [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]] ({{harvnb|d'Alembert|2009 [1751]}}; {{harvnb|Henry|2004}}).

===Artistic===
{{Main|Modern art}}

After modernist political thinking had already become widely known in France, [[Rousseau]]'s re-examination of human nature led to a new criticism of the value of [[reason]]ing itself which in turn led to a new understanding of less rationalistic human activities, especially the arts. The initial influence was upon the movements known as [[German Idealism]] and [[Romanticism]] in the 18th and 19th century. Modern art therefore belongs only to the later phases of modernity {{harv|Orwinand Tarcov|1997|loc=chapt. 2,4{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with specific page citation.--&gt;}}.

For this reason [[art history]] keeps the term "modernity" distinct from the terms [[Modern History|Modern Age]] and [[Modernism]] – as a discrete "term applied to the cultural condition in which the seemingly absolute necessity of [[innovation]] becomes a primary fact of life, work, and thought". And modernity in art "is more than merely the state of being modern, or the opposition between old and new" {{harv|Smith|2009}}.

In the [[essay]] "The Painter of Modern Life" (1864)&lt;!--NB: Baudelaire died in 1867, do not confuse this date of original composition with the year of publication of the English edition of Baudelaire's writings.--&gt;, Charles Baudelaire gives a literary definition: "By modernity I mean the transitory, the fugitive, the contingent" {{harv|Baudelaire|1964|loc=13}}.

Advancing technological innovation, affecting artistic technique and the means of manufacture, changed rapidly the possibilities of art and its status in a rapidly changing society.  Photography challenged the place of the painter and painting.  Architecture was transformed by the availability of steel for structures.

===Theological===
From theologian [[Thomas C. Oden]]'s perspective, "modernity" is marked by "four fundamental values" {{harv|Hall|1990}}: 
* "Moral relativism (which says that what is right is dictated by culture, social location, and situation)"
* "Autonomous individualism (which assumes that moral authority comes essentially from within)"
* "Narcissistic hedonism (which focuses on egocentric personal pleasure)"
* "Reductive naturalism (which reduces what is reliably known to what one can see, hear, and empirically investigate)"
Modernity rejects anything "old" and makes "novelty ... a criterion for truth." This results in a great "phobic response to anything antiquarian." In contrast, "classical Christian consciousness" resisted "novelty" {{harv|Hall|1990}}.

Pope Pius IX and Pope Pius X of the Roman Catholic Church claim that [[Modernism in the Catholic Church|Modernism]] (in a particular definition of the Catholic Church) is a danger to the Christian faith. Pope Pius IX compiled a [[Syllabus of Errors]] published on December 8, 1864 to describe his objections to Modernism {{harv|Pius IX|1864}}. Pope Pius X further elaborated on the characteristics and consequences of Modernism, from his perspective, in an encyclical entitled "[[Pascendi dominici gregis]]" (Feeding the Lord's Flock) on September 8, 1907 {{harv|Pius X|1907}}. Pascendi Dominici Gregis states that the principles of Modernism, taken to a logical conclusion, lead to atheism. The Roman Catholic Church was serious enough about the threat of Modernism that it required all Roman Catholic clergy, pastors, confessors, preachers, religious superiors and seminary professors to swear an [[Oath against modernism|Oath Against Modernism]]  {{harv|Pius X|1910}} from 1910 until this directive was rescinded in 1967.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;!--The 1910 source does not (and cannot) confirm the directive was rescinded in 1967.--&gt;

==Defined==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Don Quixote]] --&gt;
Of the available conceptual definitions in [[sociology]], modernity is "marked and defined by an obsession with '[[evidence]]'," [[visual culture]], and personal visibility {{harv|Leppert|2004|loc=19}}. Generally, the large-scale social integration constituting modernity, involves{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} the:
* increased movement of goods, [[Capital (economics)|capital]], people, and information among formerly discrete populations, and consequent influence beyond the local area
* increased formal social organization of mobile populaces, development of "circuits" on which they and their influence travel, and societal standardization conducive to socio-economic mobility
* increased specialization of the segments of society, i.e., [[division of labor]], and area inter-dependency
* increased level of excessive stratification in terms of social life of a modern man 
* Increased state of dehumanisation, dehumanity, unionisation, as man became embittered about the negative turn of events which sprouted a growing fear. 
* man became a victim of the underlying circumstances presented by the modern world 
* Increased competitiveness amongst people in the society (survival of the fittest) as the jungle rule sets in.

The '''Napoleonic era''' is a period in the [[history of France]] and [[history of Europe|Europe]]. It is generally classified as including the fourth and final stage of the [[French Revolution]], the first being the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]], the second being the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]], and the third being the [[French Directory|Directory]]. The Napoleonic era begins roughly with [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s ''[[18 Brumaire|coup d'état]]'', overthrowing the Directory, establishing the [[French Consulate]], and ends during the [[Hundred Days]] and his defeat at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] (9 November 1799&amp;nbsp;– 28 June 1815). The [[Congress of Vienna]] soon set out to restore Europe to pre-French Revolution days. Napoleon brought political stability to a land torn by revolution and war. He made peace with the Roman Catholic Church and reversed the most radical religious policies of the Convention. In 1804 Napoleon promulgated the [[Civil Code]], a revised body of civil law, which also helped stabilize French society. The Civil Code affirmed the political and legal equality of all adult men and established a merit-based society in which individuals advanced in education and employment because of talent rather than birth or social standing. The Civil Code confirmed many of the moderate revolutionary policies of the National Assembly but retracted measures passed by the more radical Convention. The code restored patriarchal authority in the family, for example, by making women and children subservient to male heads of households.

Whilst working to stabilise France, Napoleon also sought to extend his authority throughout Europe. Napoleon's armies conquered the Iberian and Italian peninsulas, occupied lands, and he forced Austria, Prussia, and Russia to ally with him and respect French hegemony in Europe. The United Kingdom refused to recognise French hegemony and continued the war throughout.

The [[First French Empire]] began to unravel in 1812, when he decided to [[French invasion of Russia|invade Russia]]. Napoleon underestimated the difficulties his army would have to face whilst occupying Russia. Convinced that the Tsar was conspiring with his British enemies, Napoleon led an army of 600,000 soldiers to Moscow. He defeated the Russian army at Borodino before capturing Moscow, but the Tsar withdrew and Moscow was set ablaze, leaving Napoleon's vast army without adequate shelter or supplies. Napoleon ordered a retreat, but the bitter [[Russian winter]]  and repeated Russian attacks whittled down his army, and only a battered remnant of 30,000 soldiers managed to limp back to French territory. The allies then continued a united effort against Napoleon until they had seized Paris forcing his abdication in 1814. His return to power the next year was resisted by all the allies and his army was defeated by an Anglo-Allied force at Waterloo.

The '''Oral History Society''' promotes the collection, preservation and use of recorded memories of the past.

As well as offering practical advice and support, the Society aims to raise standards in [[oral history]] practices across a range of activities and disciplines.

Through an annual conference, other meetings, a web site and the ''Oral History'' journal the Society encourages individuals to share ideas, experience and good practice.

The Society also provides a voice for oral historians advising and collaborating with national organisations and research councils on oral history

==Origins and history==
The British-based organisation was founded in 1973, with its origins in an informal day conference at the British Institute of Recorded Sound (BIRS) in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;George Ewart Evans, Thea Thompson, Tony Green, Theo Barker and Patrick Saul, ‘The Leicester Conference on the problems of Oral History',  ''Oral History'', Vol. 1, No. 3 (1972), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early years support for the Society was drawn from amongst labour and social historians as well as archivists, folklorists, ethnographers and researchers in oral tradition (including the [[School of Scottish Studies]]). By the second half of the 1970s the Society also included feminist historians and others interested in women's history. The ''Oral History'' journal, founded by [[Paul Thompson (oral historian)|Paul Thompson]], has echoed these interests and many more in the articles it has published. Often featuring oral histories of individuals or groups who have been under-represented in historical accounts, from the first edition ''Oral History'' has also provided a forum for oral historians to discuss the methods and challenges involved in the collection, interpretation and dissemination of oral testimonies.

The journal has long maintained a news section that includes reports from community projects as well as a reviews section. This reflects the Society's policy of representing oral historians no matter where they work whether it is in education, community organisations or the media.

==Current activities==
Current activities include providing more than 300 training places each year; supporting over 40 experienced oral historians as locally based Regional Networkers - a point of contact for anyone interested in oral history; offering technical, legal and ethical advice; providing information on the funding of oral history work; and publishing two editions of ''Oral History'' each year. Members also receive a free e-newsletter several times a year with briefings and news items.

==Governance and structures==
A Committee of Trustees meets four times a year. Trustees are responsible for the governance of the Society and are elected at the Society's Annual General Meeting which is held at the Society's annual conference. Officers' positions of the Society include a Chair, Vice-Chair, Secretary and Treasurer who are also elected annually.

A key structure of the Society is the Regional Network consisting of oral historians who offer a first point of contact in localities throughout Britain and Northern Ireland. The Trustees' sub-committees reflect the priority areas and include a Nominations Committee, Higher Education Group, Trainers Group and an Archives Sub-Committee. The journal has its own Editorial Committee.

== Social origins in nature ==

=== Origin of social groups ===
==== Hobbes ====
[[Image:Leviathan_by_Thomas_Hobbes.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Frontispiece of "Leviathan," by [[Abraham Bosse]], with input from Hobbes]]
Arguably the most influential theory of human social origins is that of [[Thomas Hobbes]], who in his ''Leviathan''&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hobbes. Leviathan: Or the Matter, Forme, and Power of a Common-Wealth Ecclesiasticall and Civill, ed. by Ian Shapiro (Yale University Press; 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; argued that without strong government, society would collapse into ''[[Bellum omnium contra omnes]]'' — "the war of all against all":
{{quotation|In such condition, there is no place for industry; because the fruit thereof is uncertain: and consequently no culture of the earth; no navigation, nor use of the commodities that may be imported by sea; no commodious building; no instruments of moving, and removing, such things as require much force; no knowledge of the face of the earth; no account of time; no arts; no letters; no society; and which is worst of all, continual fear, and danger of violent death; and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.|{{Citation|title=Leviathan|chapter=Chapter XIII: Of the Natural Condition of Mankind As Concerning Their Felicity, and Misery.}}}} Hobbes' innovation was to attribute the establishment of society to a founding '[[social contract]]', in which the Crown's subjects surrender some part of their freedom in return for security.

If Hobbes' idea is accepted, it follows that society could not have emerged prior to the state. This school of thought has remained influential to this day.&lt;ref&gt;W. G. Runciman (ed.), ''The Origin of Human Social Institutions.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent in this respect is British archaeologist [[Colin Renfrew]] (Baron Renfrew of Kaimsthorn), who points out that the state did not emerge until long after the evolution of ''Homo sapiens''. The earliest representatives of our species, according to Renfrew, may well have been ''anatomically'' modern, but they were not yet ''cognitively'' or ''behaviourally'' modern. For example, they lacked political leadership, large-scale cooperation, food production, organised religion, law or symbolic artefacts. Humans were simply hunter-gatherers, who — much like extant apes — ate whatever food they could find in the vicinity. Renfrew controversially suggests that hunter-gatherers to this day think and socialise along lines not radically different from those of their nonhuman primate counterparts. In particular, he says that they do not "ascribe symbolic meaning to material objects" and for that reason "lack fully developed 'mind.'"{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

However, hunter-gatherer ethnographers emphasise that extant foraging peoples certainly do have social institutions — notably institutionalised rights and duties codified in formal systems of kinship.&lt;ref&gt;Lévi Strauss, C. 1969. ''The Elementary Structures of Kinship''. London: Eyre and Spottiswoode.&lt;/ref&gt; Elaborate rituals such as initiation ceremonies serve to cement contracts and commitments, quite independently of the state.&lt;ref&gt;Van Gennep, A. 1960 [1909] ''The Rites of Passage.'' London: Routledge and Kegan Paul.&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars would add that insofar as we can speak of "human revolutions" — "major transitions" in human evolution&lt;ref&gt;Maynard Smith, J. and E. Szathmáry 1995. ''The Major Transitions in Evolution.'' Oxford: W. H. Freeman.&lt;/ref&gt; — the first was not the Neolithic Revolution but the rise of symbolic culture that occurred toward the end of the Middle Stone Age.&lt;ref&gt;Mellars, P. A., K. Boyle, O. Bar-Yosef and C. Stringer (eds), 2007. ''Rethinking the Human Revolution: new behavioural and biological perspectives on the origin and dispersal of modern humans.'' Cambridge: McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Knight, C., C. Power and I. Watts 1995. The human symbolic revolution: A Darwinian account. ''Cambridge Archaeological Journal.'' 5(1): 75–114.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguing the exact opposite of Hobbes's position, anarchist anthropologist [[Pierre Clastres]] views the state and society as mutually incompatible: genuine society is always struggling to survive ''against'' the state.&lt;ref&gt;Clastres, P. 1977. ''[[Society Against the State]].'' Trans. R. Hurley in collaboration with A. Stein. Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Jean-Jacques Rousseau ====
[[File:Jean-Jacques Rousseau (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|Rousseau in 1753]]
Like Hobbes, [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] argued that society was born in a social contract. In Rousseau's case, however, sovereignty is vested in the entire populace, who enter into the contract directly with one another. "The problem", he explained, "is to find a form of association which will defend and protect with the whole common force the person and goods of each associate, and in which each, while uniting himself with all, may still obey himself alone, and remain as free as before." This is the fundamental problem of which the Social Contract provides the solution. The contract's clauses, Rousseau continued, may be reduced to one — "the total alienation of each associate, together with all his rights, to the whole community. Each man, in giving himself to all, gives himself to nobody; and as there is no associate over whom he does not acquire the same right as he yields others over himself, he gains an equivalent for everything he loses, and an increase of force for the preservation of what he has". In other words: "Each of us puts his person and all his power in common under the supreme direction of the general will, and, in our corporate capacity, we receive each member as an indivisible part of the whole." At once, in place of the individual personality of each contracting party, this act of association creates a moral and collective body, composed of as many members as the assembly contains votes, and receiving from this act its unity, its common identity, its life and its will.&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, J.-J. 1973 [1762]. The social contract. In Jean-Jacques Rousseau, ''The Social Contract and Discourses.'' ''Trans. G. D. H. Cole. New edition. London &amp; Melbourne: Dent. Book I, Ch. 6.''&lt;/ref&gt; By this means, each member of the community acquires not only the capacities of the whole but also, for the first time, rational mentality:

{{quotation|The passage from the state of nature to the civil state produces a very remarkable change in man, by substituting justice for instinct in his conduct, and giving his actions the morality they had formerly lacked. Then only, when the voice of duty takes the place of physical impulses and right of appetite, does man, who so far had considered only himself, find that he is forced to act on different principles, and to consult his reason before listening to his inclinations.|{{Citation|title= ''Jean-Jacques Rousseau,'' The Social Contract and Discourses. ''Trans. G. D. H. Cole. New edition. London &amp; Melbourne: Dent. Book I Ch. 8.''}}}}

====Sir Henry Sumner Maine====
In his influential book, ''Ancient Law'' (1861), Maine argued that in early times, the basic unit of human social organisation was the patriarchal family:

[[Image:Maine by Dickinson.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Sir Henry James Sumner Maine]]{{quotation|The effect of the evidence derived from comparative jurisprudence is to establish the view of the primeval condition of the human race which is known as the Patriarchal Theory.|{{Citation|title= ''Maine, H. S. 1861. ''Ancient Law.'' London: John Murray. p. 122.''}}}}

Hostile to French revolutionary and other radical social ideas, Maine's motives were partly political. He sought to undermine the legacy of Rousseau and other advocates of man’s natural rights by asserting that originally, no one had any rights at all – ‘every man, living during the greater part of his life under the patriarchal despotism, was practically controlled in all his actions by a regimen not of law but of caprice’.&lt;ref&gt;Maine, H. S. 1861. ''Ancient Law.'' London: John Murray. p.8.&lt;/ref&gt; Not only were the patriarch’s children subject to what Maine calls his ‘despotism’: his wife and his slaves were equally affected. The very notion of kinship, according to Maine, was simply a way of categorizing those who were forcibly subjected to the despot’s arbitrary rule. Maine later added a Darwinian strand to this argument. In his ''The Descent of Man,'' Darwin had cited reports that a wild-living male gorilla would monopolise for itself as large a harem of females as it could violently defend. Maine endorsed Darwin’s speculation that ‘primeval man’ probably 'lived in small communities, each with as many wives as he could support and obtain, whom he would have jealously guarded against all other men’.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C. 1871. ''The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex,'' 2 vols. London: Murray. Vol. 2, p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt; Under pressure to spell out exactly what he meant by the term 'patriarchy', Maine clarified that ‘sexual jealousy, indulged through power, might serve as a definition of the Patriarchal Family’.&lt;ref&gt;Maine, H. S. 1883. ''Early Law and Custom.'' London: John Murray, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Lewis Henry Morgan ====
[[File:Lewishenrymorgan.jpg|200px|thumb|Lewis H. Morgan]]
In his influential book, ''Ancient Society'' (1877), its title echoing Maine's ''Ancient Law,'' [[Lewis Henry Morgan]] proposed a very different theory. Morgan insisted that throughout the earlier periods of human history, neither the state nor the family existed.

{{quotation| It may be here premised that all forms of government are reducible to two general plans, using the word plan in its scientific sense. In their bases the two are fundamentally distinct. The first, in the order of time, is founded upon persons, and upon relations purely personal, and may be distinguished as a society ''(societas)''. The gens is the unit of this organization; giving as the successive stages of integration, in the archaic period, the gens, the phratry, the tribe, and the confederacy of tribes, which constituted a people or nation (''populus''). At a later period a coalescence of tribes in the same area into a nation took the place of a confederacy of tribes occupying independent areas. Such, through prolonged ages, after the gens appeared, was the substantially universal organization of ancient society; and it remained among the Greeks and Romans after civilization supervened. The second is founded upon territory and upon property, and may be distinguished as a state ''(civitas).''|{{Citation|title= ''Morgan, L. H. 1877.'' Ancient Society. ''Chicago: Charles H. Kerr, p. 6.''}}}} In place of both family and state, according to Morgan, was the ''gens'' — nowadays termed the 'clan' — based initially on matrilocal residence and matrilineal descent. This aspect of Morgan's theory, later endorsed by Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, is nowadays widely considered discredited (but for a critical survey of the current consensus, see Knight 2008, 'Early Human Kinship Was Matrilineal'&lt;ref&gt;Knight, C. 2008. [http://www.radicalanthropologygroup.org/old/class_text_105.pdf Early human kinship was matrilineal]. In N. J. Allen, H. Callan, R. Dunbar and W. James (eds.), ''Early Human Kinship''. Oxford: Blackwell, pp. 61–82.&lt;/ref&gt;).

==== Frederick Engels ====
[[File:Engels.jpg|thumb|200px|Frederick Engels]]

[[Frederick Engels]] built on Morgan's ideas in his 1884 essay, ''The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State in the light of the researches of Lewis Henry Morgan.'' His primary interest was the position of women in early society, and — in particular — Morgan's insistence that the matrilineal clan preceded the family as society's fundamental unit. 'The mother-right gens', wrote Engels in his survey of contemporary historical materialist scholarship, 'has become the pivot around which the entire science turns...' Engels argued that the matrilineal clan represented a principle of self-organization so vibrant and effective that it allowed no room for patriarchal dominance or the territorial state.{{quotation|The first class antagonism which appears in human history coincides with the development of the antagonism between man and woman in monogamian marriage, and the first class oppression with that of the female sex by the male.|{{Citation|title= ''Engels, F. 1940 [1884]'' The origin of the family, private property and the state. ''London: Lawrence and Wishart.''}}}}

====Emile Durkheim====
{{Infobox scientist
|name = Émile Durkheim
|image = Emile_Durkheim.jpg
|image_size = 200px}}

[[Emile Durkheim]] considered that in order to exist, any human social system must counteract the natural tendency for the sexes to promiscuously conjoin. He argued that social order presupposes sexual morality, which is expressed in prohibitions against sex with certain people or during certain periods — in traditional societies particularly during menstruation.

{{quotation|One first fact is certain: that is, that the entire system of prohibitions must strictly conform to the ideas that primitive man had about menstruation and about menstrual blood. For all these taboos start only with the onset of puberty: and it is only when the first signs of blood appear that they reach their maximum rigour.|{{Citation|title= ''Durkheim, E. 1963 [1898]. La prohibition de l'inceste et ses origines.'' L'Année Sociologique ''1: 1–70. Reprinted as'' Incest. The nature and origin of the taboo, ''trans. E. Sagarin. New York: Stuart, p. 81.''}}}}

The incest taboo, wrote Durkheim in 1898, is no more than a particular example of something more basic and universal - the ritualistic setting apart of 'the sacred' from 'the profane'. This begins as the segregation of the sexes, each of which - at least on important occasions - is 'sacred' or 'set apart' from the other. 'The two sexes', as Durkheim explains, 'must avoid each other with the same care as the profane flees from the sacred and the sacred from the profane.' Women as sisters act out the role of 'sacred' beings invested 'with an isolating power of some sort, a power which holds the masculine population at a distance.' Their menstrual blood in particular sets them in a category apart, exercising a 'type of repulsing action which keeps the other sex far from them'. In this way, the earliest ritual structure emerges — establishing morally regulated 'society' for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, E. 1963. [1898] La prohibition de l’inceste et ses origines. ''L’Année Sociologique'' 1: 1–70. Reprinted as ''Incest. The nature and origin of the taboo,'' trans. E. Sagarin. New York: Stuart.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sigmund Freud====
[[Charles Darwin]] pictured early human society as resembling that of apes, with one or more dominant males jealously guarding a harem of females.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C. 1871. ''The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex,'' 2 vols. London: Murray. Vol. 2, p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt; In his myth of the 'Primal Horde', [[Sigmund Freud]] later took all this as his starting point but then postulated an insurrection mounted by the tyrant's own sons:{{quotation|All that we find there is a violent and jealous father who keeps all the females for himself and drives away his sons as they grow up…. One day the brothers who had been driven out came together, killed and devoured their father and so made an end of the patriarchal horde.|{{Citation|title= ''Freud, S. 1965 [1913].'' Totem and Taboo. ''London: Routledge, p. 141.''}}}} Following this, the band of brothers were about to take sexual possession of their mothers and sisters when suddenly they were overcome with remorse. In their contradictory emotional state, their dead father now became stronger than the living one had been. In memory of him, the brothers revoked their deed by forbidding the killing and eating of the 'totem' (as their father had now become) and renouncing their claim to the women who had just been set free. In this way, the two fundamental taboos of primitive society – not to eat the totem and not to marry one's sisters – were established for the first time.

====Marshall Sahlins====
A related but less dramatic version of Freud's 'sexual revolution' idea was proposed in 1960 by American social anthropologist [[Marshall Sahlins]].&lt;ref&gt;Sahlins, M. D. 1960. The origin of society. ''Scientific American'' 203(3): 76–87.&lt;/ref&gt; Somehow, he writes, the world of primate brute competition and sexual dominance was turned upside-down: {{quotation|The decisive battle between early culture and human nature must have been waged on the field of [[primate sexuality]]….  Among subhuman primates sex had organized society; the customs of hunters and gatherers testify eloquently that now society was to organize sex…. In selective adaptation to the perils of the Stone Age, human society overcame or subordinated such primate propensities as selfishness, indiscriminate sexuality, dominance and brute competition. It substituted kinship and co-operation for conflict, placed solidarity over sex, morality over might. In its earliest days it accomplished the greatest reform in history, the overthrow of human primate nature, and thereby secured the evolutionary future of the species.|{{Citation|title= ''Sahlins, M. D. 1960 The origin of society.'' Scientific American ''203(3): 76–87.''}}}}

==== Christopher Boehm ====
{{quotation| Once a prehistoric hunting band institutionalized a successful and decisive rebellion, and did away with the alpha-male role permanently... it is easy to see how this institution would have spread.|{{Citation|title=''Boehm, C. 2000.'' ''Journal of Consciousness Studies 7, 1–2 pp. 79–101; p. 97.''}}}}
If we accept Rousseau's line of reasoning, no single dominant individual is needed to embody society, to guarantee security or to enforce social contracts. The people themselves can do these things, combining to enforce the general will. A modern origins theory along these lines is that of evolutionary anthropologist [[Christopher Boehm]]. Boehm argues that ape social organisation tends to be despotic, typically with one or more dominant males monopolising access to the locally available females. But wherever there is dominance, we can also expect resistance. In the human case, resistance to being personally dominated intensified as humans used their social intelligence to form coalitions. Eventually, a point was reached when the costs of attempting to impose dominance became so high that the strategy was no longer evolutionarily stable, whereupon social life tipped over into 'reverse dominance' — defined as a situation in which only the entire community, on guard against primate-style individual dominance, is permitted to use force to suppress deviant behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Boehm, C. 2001. ''Hierarchy in the Forest. The evolution of egalitarian behavior.'' Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ernest Gellner ====
Human beings, writes social anthropologist Ernest Gellner, are not genetically programmed to be members of this or that social order. You can take a human infant and place it into any kind of social order and it will function acceptably. What makes human society so distinctive is the fabulous range of quite different forms it takes across the world. Yet in any given society, the range of permitted behaviours is quite narrowly constrained. This is not owing to the existence of any externally imposed system of rewards and punishments. The constraints come from within — from certain compulsive moral concepts which members of the social order have internalised. The society installs these concepts in each individual's psyche in the manner first identified by Emile Durkheim, namely, by means of collective rituals such as initiation rites. Therefore, the problem of the origins of society boils down to the problem of the origins of collective ritual.

{{quotation|How is a  society established, and a series of societies diversified, whilst each of them is restrained from chaotically exploiting that wide diversity of possible human behaviour? A theory is available concerning how this may be done and it is one of the basic theories of social anthropology. The way in which you restrain people from doing a wide variety of things, not compatible with the social order of which they are members, is that you subject them to ritual. The process is simple: you make them dance around a totem pole until they are wild with excitement, and become jellies in the hysteria of collective frenzy; you enhance their emotional state by any device, by all the locally available audio-visual aids, drugs, music and so on; and once they are really high, you stamp upon their minds the type of concept or notion to which they subsequently become enslaved.|{{Citation|title=''Gellner, E. 1988. Origins of Society. In A. C. Fabian (ed.),'' Origins. The Darwin College Lectures. ''Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp.128–140; p. 130.''}}}}

===Gender and origins===
Feminist scholars — among them palaeoanthropologists Leslie Aiello and Camilla Power — take similar arguments a step further, arguing that any reform or revolution which overthrew male dominance must surely have been led by women. Evolving human females, Power and Aiello suggest, actively separated themselves from males on a periodic basis, using their own blood (and/or pigments such as red ochre) to mark themselves as fertile and defiant: {{quotation|The sexual division of labor entails differentiation of roles in food procurement, with logistic hunting of large game by males, co-operation and exchange of products. Our hypothesis is that symbolism arose in this context. To minimize energetic costs of travel, coalitions of women began to invest in home bases. To secure this strategy, women would have to use their attractive, collective signal of impending fertility in a wholly new way: by signalling refusal of sexual access except to males who returned "home" with provisions.

==Sociobiological theories==
=== Robert Trivers ===

{{quotation|I consider Trivers one of the great thinkers in the history of Western thought. It would not be too much of an exaggeration to say that he has provided a scientific explanation for the human condition: the intricately complicated and endlessly fascinating relationships that bind us to one another.|[https://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/trivers04/trivers04_index.html ''Steven Pinker on Robert Trivers'']}}

In his 1985 book, ''Social Evolution'',&lt;ref&gt;Trivers, R. L. 1985. ''Social Evolution''. Menlo Park, CA: Benjamin/Cummings.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Trivers]] outlines the theoretical framework used today by most evolutionary biologists to understand how and why societies are established. Trivers sets out from the fundamental fact that genes survive beyond the death of the bodies they inhabit, because copies of the same gene may be replicated in multiple different bodies. From this, it follows that a creature should behave altruistically to the extent that those benefiting carry the same genes — 'inclusive fitness', as this source of cooperation in nature is termed.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, W. D. 1964. The genetical evolution of social behaviour. I, II. ''Journal of Theoretical Biology'' 7: 1–52.&lt;/ref&gt; Where animals are unrelated, cooperation should be limited to 'reciprocal altruism' or 'tit-for-tat'.&lt;ref&gt;Trivers, R. L. 1971. The Evolution of Reciprocal Altruism. ''The Quarterly Review of Biology'' 46 (1): 35–57.&lt;/ref&gt;
Where previously, biologists took parent-offspring cooperation for granted, Trivers predicted on theoretical grounds both cooperation and conflict — as when a mother needs to wean an existing baby (even against its will) in order to make way for another.&lt;ref&gt;Trivers, R. L. 1974. Parent-Offspring Conflict. ''American Zoologist'' 14 (1): 249–264.&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, biologists had interpreted male infanticidal behaviour as aberrant and inexplicable or, alternatively, as a necessary strategy for culling excess population.&lt;ref&gt;Wynne-Edwards, V.C. 1962. ''Animal dispersion in relation to social behaviour.'' Edinburgh: Oliver &amp; Boyd.&lt;/ref&gt; Trivers was able to show that such behaviour was a logical strategy by males to enhance their own reproductive success at the expense of conspecifics including rival males. Ape or monkey females whose babies are threatened have directly opposed interests, often forming coalitions to defend themselves and their offspring against infanticidal males.&lt;ref&gt;Trivers, R. L. 1985. ''Social Evolution.'' Menlo Park, CA: Benjamin/Cummings, pp 79–85.&lt;/ref&gt;
Human society, according to Trivers, is unusual in that it involves the male of the species investing parental care in his own offspring — a rare pattern for a primate. Where such cooperation occurs, it's not enough to take it for granted: in Trivers' view we need to ''explain'' it using an overarching theoretical framework applicable to humans and nonhumans alike.&lt;ref&gt;Trivers, R. L. 1972. Parental investment and sexual selection. In B. Campbell (ed.) ''Sexual selection and the descent of man, 1871–1971''. Chicago, Aldine, pp. 136–179.&lt;/ref&gt;{{quotation|Everybody has a social life. All living creatures reproduce and reproduction is a social event, since at its bare minimum it involves the genetic and material construction of one individual by another. In turn, differences between individuals in the number of their surviving offspring (natural selection) is the driving force behind organic evolution. Life is intrinsically social and it evolves through a process of natural selection which is itself social. For these reasons social evolution refers not only to the evolution of social relationships between individuals but also to deeper themes of biological organization stretching from gene to community.|{{Citation|title=''Robert Trivers, 1985.''

=== Robin Dunbar ===

[[Image: Robin Dunbar (6293027302).jpg |thumb|right|200px|Robin Dunbar]][[Robin Dunbar]] originally studied gelada baboons in the wild in Ethiopia, and has done much to synthesise modern primatological knowledge with Darwinian theory into a comprehensive overall picture. The components of primate social systems 'are essentially alliances of a political nature aimed at enabling the animals concerned to achieve more effective solutions to particular problems of survival and reproduction'.&lt;ref&gt;Dunbar. 1988. ''Primate Social Systems.'' Chapman Hall and Yale University Press, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Primate societies are in essence 'multi-layered sets of coalitions'.&lt;ref&gt;Dunbar. 1988. ''Primate Social Systems.'' Chapman Hall and Yale University Press, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; Although physical fights are ultimately decisive, the social mobilisation of allies usually decides matters and requires skills that go beyond mere fighting ability. The manipulation and use of coalitions demands sophisticated social — more precisely ''political'' — intelligence.
Usually but not always, males exercise dominance over females. Even where male despotism prevails, females typically gang up with one another to pursue agendas of their own. When a male gelada baboon attacks a previously dominant rival so as to take over his harem, the females concerned may insist on their own say in the outcome. At various stages during the fighting, the females may 'vote' among themselves on whether to accept the provisional outcome. Rejection is signalled by refusing to groom the challenger; acceptance is signalled by going up to him and grooming him. According to Dunbar, the ultimate outcome of an inter-male 'sexual fight' always depends on the female 'vote'.&lt;ref&gt;Dunbar. 1988. ''Primate Social Systems.'' Chapman Hall and Yale University Press, pp. 166, 167, 243.&lt;/ref&gt;
Dunbar points out that in a primate social system, lower-ranking females will typically suffer the most intense harassment. Consequently, they will be the first to form coalitions in self-defence. But maintaining commitment from coalition allies involves much time-consuming manual grooming, putting pressure on time-budgets. In the case of evolving humans, who were living in increasingly large groups, the costs would soon have outweighed the benefits — unless some more efficient way of maintaining relationships could be found. Dunbar argues that 'vocal grooming' — using the voice to signal commitment — was the time-saving solution adopted, and that this led eventually to speech. Dunbar goes on to suggest (citing evolutionary anthropologist Chris Knight&lt;ref&gt;Knight, C. 2011 [1989]. [http://www.radicalanthropologygroup.org/old/pub_origins_hs.pdf ''The origins of society.''] London: Radical Anthropology Group.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Knight, C. 1991. ''Blood Relations. Menstruation and the origins of culture.'' New Haven and London: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;) that ''distinctively human'' society may have been evolved under pressure from female ritual and 'gossiping' coalitions established to dissuade males from fighting one another and instead cooperate in hunting for the benefit of the whole camp: {{quotation| If females formed the core of these early groups, and language evolved to bond these groups, it naturally follows that the early human females were the first to speak. This reinforces the suggestion that language was first used to create a sense of emotional solidarity between allies. Chris Knight has argued a passionate case for the idea that language first evolved to allow the females in these early groups to band together to force males to invest in them and their offspring, principally by hunting for meat. This would be consistent with the fact that, among modern humans, women are generally better at verbal skills than men, as well as being more skilful in the social domain. |{{Citation|title=''Dunbar, R. I. M. 1996.'' Grooming, Gossip and the Evolution of Language. ''London: Faber and Faber, p. 149.''}}}} Dunbar stresses that this is currently a minority theory among specialists in human origins — most still support the 'bison-down-at-the-lake' theory attributing early language and cooperation to the imperatives of men's activities such as hunting. Despite this, he argues that 'female bonding may have been a more powerful force in human evolution than is sometimes supposed'.&lt;ref&gt;Dunbar, R. I. M. 1996. ''Grooming, Gossip and the Evolution of Language.'' London: Faber and Faber, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; Although still controversial, the idea that female coalitions may have played a decisive role has subsequently received strong support from a number of anthropologists including Sarah Hrdy,&lt;ref&gt;Hrdy,  S. B. 2009. ''Mothers and others. The evolutionary origins of mutual understanding.'' London and Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Camilla Power,&lt;ref&gt;Power, C. 1998. Old wives’ tales: the gossip hypothesis and the reliability of cheap signals. In J. R. Hurford, M. Studdert Kennedy and C. Knight (eds), ''Approaches to the Evolution of Language: Social and Cognitive Bases.''

A '''political midlife crisis''' is a turning point or watershed moment in the fortunes of a governance entity such as an empire, nation, faction, political party, or international alliance. The concept was first advanced by Arab thinker [[Ibn Khaldun]] (1332–1406), who compared an individual's decline after reaching the age of forty, with the sedentary decline that occurs in a dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Khaldun]], ''[[Muqaddimah]]'', Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1978, p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, political scientist [[Joshua S Goldstein]] has used the concept in his 1988 book, ''Long Cycles: Prosperity and War in the Modern Age''.

A political midlife crisis occurs following a prolonged [[Golden age (metaphor)|golden age]] of optimism, economic progress, conquest, or other success, and typically features attacks on, or threats toward, a rival power. The attacks are vigorously opposed, ending in stalemate or defeat.

The term "political midlife crisis" adverts to the concept of "[[midlife crisis]]", which describes a supposed crisis in a middle-aged person's identity and self-confidence, caused by events that highlight the person's aging, mortality, and any perceived deficiencies in life attainments.  The concept of political midlife crisis applies the concept of midlife crisis to the concepts of "[[social organism]]" and "[[body politic]]", which view an entire human [[society]] as a kind of single super-organism.

==History of the concept==
[[Ibn Khaldun]], in the ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' (1377), set out a general theory of the rise and fall of regimes.  A ruthless conqueror with a 
"[[desert]] attitude" establishes a new dynasty.  Over some years, royal authority and ''asabiyyah'' ([[social cohesion]]) enable "expansion to the limit". Then, as in the life of an individual, a turning point is reached.  According to Ibn Khaldun, when a man reaches forty he naturally stops growing, then begins to decline.  The same is the case with a sedentary civilization's culture.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Khaldun]], ''[[Muqaddimah]]'', Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1978, p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt;  The dynasty's new sedentary culture fosters a love of luxury and pomp.  The people become over-taxed and acquire a "habit of subservience".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Khaldun]], ''[[Muqaddimah]]'', Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1978, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;  Their rulers subvert property rights and become weak, dishonest, and divided.  Finally, after three generations—equivalent to a human lifespan—the dynasty becomes "senile and coercive".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Khaldun]], ''[[Muqaddimah]]'', Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1978, pp. 245, 255.&lt;/ref&gt;  There may follow a final "brightly burning show of power",&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Khaldun]], ''[[Muqaddimah]]'', Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1978, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt; but collapse of the dynasty is inevitable.  A new dynasty takes over, and the cycle continues.  Ibn Khaldun says:  "This senility is a chronic disease that cannot be cured, because it is something natural."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Khaldun]], ''[[Muqaddimah]]'', Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1978, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988 [[Joshua S Goldstein]] advanced the concept of the political midlife crisis in his book on "[[Long Cycle Theory|long cycle theory]]", ''Long Cycles:  Prosperity and War in the Modern Age'',&lt;ref name=goldstein&gt;{{citation |first=Joshua |last= Goldstein |authorlink=Joshua S Goldstein |title=Long Cycles:  Prosperity and War in the Modern Age |url=http://www.joshuagoldstein.com/jgcycle.htm |publisher= Yale University Press |year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{pn|date=October 2017}} which offers four examples of the process:

*The [[British Empire]] and the [[Crimean War]] (1853–1856): A century after Britain's successful launch of the [[Industrial Revolution]], and following the subsequent British railway boom of 1815–1853, Britain, in the [[Crimean War]], attacked the [[Russian Empire]], which was perceived as a threat to [[Company rule in India|British India]] and to eastern Mediterranean trade routes to India. The Crimean War highlighted the poor state of the [[British Army]], and Britain took no further part in European wars until the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914.
*The [[German Empire]] (Second Reich) and [[World War I]] (1914–1918): Under Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]], Germany had been unified between 1864 and 1871, and then had seen 40 years' rapid industrial, military, and colonial expansion. In 1914 the [[Schlieffen Plan]] for conquering [[French Third Republic|France]] in eight weeks was to have been followed by the subjugation of the [[Russian Empire]], leaving Germany the master of ''[[Mitteleuropa]]'' ([[Central Europe]]).  In the event, France, [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], Russia, and the [[United States]] fought Germany to a standstill, to defeat, and to a humiliating peace settlement at [[Versailles Treaty|Versailles]] (1919) and the establishment of Germany's unstable [[Weimar Republic]] (1919–33), in a prelude to [[World War II]].
*The [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] (1962): The Soviet Union had industrialised rapidly under [[Joseph Stalin]] and, following World War II, had become a rival nuclear [[superpower]] to the [[United States]]. In 1962 Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]], intent on securing strategic parity with the United States, covertly, with the support of [[Fidel Castro]], shipped nuclear missiles to Castro's [[Cuba under Fidel Castro|Cuba]], 70 miles from the US state of [[Florida]]. US President [[John F. Kennedy]] blockaded ("quarantined") the island of Cuba and negotiated the Soviet missiles' removal from Cuba (in exchange for the subsequent removal of US missiles from Turkey).{{vague|date=December 2017}}
*The [[United States]] and the [[Vietnam War]] (1955–1975): During World War II and the ensuing postwar period, the United States had greatly expanded its military capacities and [[military-industrial complex|industries]]. After France, supported financially by the US, had been defeated in Vietnam in 1954 and that country had been temporarily split into [[North Vietnam|North]] and [[South Vietnam]] under the 1954 [[1954 Geneva Conference|Geneva Accords]]; and when war had broken out between the North and South following South Vietnam President [[Ngo Dinh Diem]]'s refusal to permit all-Vietnam elections in 1956 as stipulated in the Geneva Accords, the ideologically [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] United States supported South Vietnam with materiel in a [[Cold War]] [[proxy war]] and by degrees allowed itself to be drawn into South Vietnam's losing struggle against communist North Vietnam and the [[Viet Cong]] acting in South Vietnam. Ultimately, following the defeat of South Vietnam and the United States, the US's governing belief that South Vietnam's defeat would result in all of remaining [[Indochina]] "going communist" (as proclaimed by the US's "[[domino theory]]"), proved erroneous.&lt;ref name=goldstein/&gt;{{pn|date=October 2017}}

Following [[Al Qaeda]]'s [[September 11 attacks| attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001]], and the United States' subsequent inconclusive wars in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan (2001–present)]] and [[Iraq War|Iraq (2003–2011)]], initiated by US President [[George W. Bush]], Professor [[Gary Weaver]] and his co-author [[Adam Mendelson]], writing in 2008, cited a survey of 109 historians, 99% of whom rated Bush a "failure" as president, two-thirds rating him the "worst ever". Weaver and Mendelson wrote that the United States had been in its "childhood" before 1898; in its "adolescence", 1898–1945; in "young adulthood", 1945–1991; in "adulthood", 1991–2001. Weaver and Mendelson, from their 2008 perspective, anticipated that the traumas of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6425">{{New Imperialism}}
The '''Porter–MacKenzie debate''' refers to a [[historiography|historiographical disagreement]] in the field of [[Historiography of the United Kingdom|Modern British]] and [[Historiography of the British Empire|Imperial history]]. It focuses on the extent to which [[colonialism]] was an important influence within [[British culture]] during the 19th and 20th centuries. The debate was characterised by disagreement between the academic historians [[Bernard Porter]] and [[John M. MacKenzie|John MacKenzie]]. Porter argued that British imperial expansion during the era of [[New Imperialism]] had little effect on ordinary people in the United Kingdom, while MacKenzie argued that colonialism dominated British popular culture for much of the period.

==Debate==
The debate began when Porter's book ''The Absent-Minded Imperialists'' appeared in print in 2004. The book argued that Empire had very little influence on [[United Kingdom|British]] [[popular culture]] in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, arguing that this was the only explanation for the absence during a period of [[New Imperialism|rapid imperial expansion]]. Porter argued that ordinary British people between 1800 and 1940 were largely indifferent to empire:

{{quote|there can be no ''presumption'' that Britain [...] was an essentially 'imperialist' nation in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Of course she was, in the sense of acquiring and ruling an empire; but that empire [...] might not have been as burdensome as it appeared. Consequently, it did not need to have had deep roots in British society — in its culture, for example — or to have affected it greatly in its turn.{{sfn|Porter|2004|p=24}} }}

''Absent-Minded Imperialists'' argued against the conclusions of previous academic studies which had stressed the extent to which imperialism had shaped European culture, following [[Edward Said]]'s ''[[Culture and Imperialism]]'' (1993).{{sfn|The Telegraph|2004}}{{sfn|Porter|2008|p=101}} Porter also attacked the conclusions of other works, like MacKenzie's 1984 ''Propaganda and Empire'' which looked at the influence of imperialist propaganda in British culture. Porter was critical of this "MacKenzie school" who argued that the influence of imperialist propaganda "must have been overwhelming if there was so much of it". According to Porter, "an alternative reading, however, might be that it could not have been all that persuasive, if the propagandists felt they needed to propagandize so hard."{{sfn|Porter|2004|p=6}} Additionally, he critiqued the source base of MacKenzie's study, suggesting that MacKenzie had selected his texts arbitrarily.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Absent-Minded Imperialists: Empire, Society and Culture in Britain|last=Porter|first=Bernard|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book received mixed reviews, with the American historian [[Antoinette Burton]] rejecting it as not "worth arguing either with or about".{{sfn|Porter|2008|p=101}} Some academics argued that the book, which was received well in the popular press, would appeal to [[British nationalism|British nationalists]] as absolving them of responsibility for empire; a claim which Porter rejected.{{sfn|Porter|2008|pp=104-5}} In a 2008 article, MacKenzie accused Porter of sidestepping inconvenient evidence by refusing to address it directly, especially when it would affect his argument:{{sfn|MacKenzie|2008|p=662}}

{{quote|In ''Absent-Minded Imperialists'', Porter uses an [[archaeology|archaeological]] metaphor to suggest that all historians have found have been 'shards' of little structural significance. As it happens, I was trained as an archaeologist and very nearly became one. I have found a lot of shards and, to the archaeologist, an assemblage of such shards in their deposits implies the existence of a culture, not its absence.{{sfn|MacKenzie|2008|p=665}} }}

Historians who are considered to support the MacKenzie position are [[Catherine Hall]], [[Antoinette Burton]] and [[Jeffrey Richards]]. [[Andrew Thompson (historian)|Andrew Thompson]] notably supported Porter. Thompson argues that there was no one ‘imperial culture’ in the nineteenth century and that empire had a complicated position in British culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Empire Strikes Back?: The Impact of Imperialism on Britain from the Mid-Nineteenth Century|last=Thompson|first=Andrew|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|isbn=|location=Oxon|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7060">The '''pseudo-Council of Sinuessa''' was a purported gathering of bishops in 303 at [[Sinuessa]],&lt;ref name="CE"/&gt; Italy, the purpose being a [[trial]] of [[Pope Marcellinus|Marcellinus]] on charges of [[apostasy]]. It is generally accepted&lt;ref name="CE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Finch303"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jewel340"/&gt; that the gathering never took place and that the purported council documents were [[forgery|forged]] for political purposes in the [[6th century]] during the schism between [[Pope Symmachus]] and [[Antipope Laurentius]]. The collection of forgeries, including the ''Council of Sinuessa'', is collectively known as the [[Symmachian forgeries]].

The ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' describes
{{cquote|an alleged synod of 300 bishops, which took place in 303 at Sinuessa (between [[Rome]] and [[Capua]]) in order to inquire into the accusation against [[Pope Marcellinus|Marcellinus]] that he had sacrificed at [[Diocletian]]'s order. On the first two days Marcellinus had denied everything, but on the third day he admitted his lapse and repented; however the synod passed no sentence on him "quia prima sedes non judicatur a quoquam." When Diocletian learnt of the occurrence, he had the pope and several bishops of this synod executed ([[Karl Josef von Hefele|Hefele]], "Konziliengeschichte", I, [[wikt:auflage|2 Aufl.]] 143–145). The spuriousness of those acts is almost certain.&lt;ref name="CE"/&gt;}}

The Latin phrase "quia prima sedes non judicatur a quoquam" means roughly "for the occupant of the highest [[episcopal see|see]] cannot be judged by anyone",&lt;ref name="Hefele128"/&gt; and the anecdote was produced in later centuries as evidence for the doctrine of [[papal supremacy]].&lt;ref name="Finch298"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hefele128"/&gt;

==Forged account==
A primary Latin account of the pseudo-Council of Sinuessa was collected by [[Giovanni Domenico Mansi]] in 1759.&lt;ref name="Mansi1249"/&gt;
[[Ignaz von Döllinger|Döllinger]] summarizes the commonly-received account:

{{cquote|Marcellinus is conducted to the temple of [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]], and there offers sacrifices, in the presence of a crowd of Christian spectators, to [[Hercules]], [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], and [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]]. At the news of this three hundred bishops leave their sees, and gather together to hold a council, first in a cavern near Sinuessa, but, as this would not hold more than fifty, afterwards in the town itself. Along with them were thirty Roman priests. Several priests and deacons are deposed, merely because they had gone away when they saw the pope enter the temple. Marcellinus, on the other hand, neither may nor can be judged, being supreme head of the church,— this conviction pervades the whole synod,— the pope can only be judged by himself. At first he attempts to palliate his act; but seventy-two witnesses make accusation against him. Thereupon he acknowledges his guilt, and himself [[papal renunciation|pronounces his own deposition]] on the 23rd of August, 303. After this the bishops remain quietly together in Sinuessa, until [[Diocletian]], upon receiving intelligence of this synod [[Roman–Persian Wars|in Persia]], sends an order for the execution of many of the three hundred, and this is carried into effect.&lt;ref name="Dollinger81"/&gt;}}

Döllinger dates the forgery to the reign of Symmachus, when Symmachus himself was being forced to answer to a synod convened by [[Theodoric]], and himself was being threatened with deposition.&lt;ref name="Dollinger85"/&gt;

==Later uses and criticism==

The story of Marcellinus and the Council of Sinuessa has been cited by later writers in support of papal supremacy.&lt;ref name="Finch298"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hefele128"/&gt;

Vice versa, one scholar writes that during the reign of [[Antipope Alexander V]], [[Jean Gerson]] used the story&lt;ref name="Gerson"/&gt; "to prove the legitimacy of a council assembled without the authority of the pope."&lt;ref name="Townsend"/&gt;

'''Social cycle theories''' are among the earliest [[social theories]] in [[sociology]]. Unlike the theory of [[social evolutionism]], which views the [[evolution of society]] and [[human history]] as progressing in some new, unique direction(s), sociological cycle theory argues that events and stages of society and history are generally repeating themselves in cycles. Such a theory does not necessarily imply that there cannot be any [[social progress]]. In the early theory of [[Sima Qian]] and the more recent theories of long-term ("secular") political-demographic cycles&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [[Korotayev]], A., Malkov, A., &amp; Khaltourina, D. (2006) [http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=299&amp;Itemid=1 ''Introduction to Social Macrodynamics: Secular Cycles and Millennial Trends.''] Moscow: URSS. {{ISBN|5-484-00559-0}}. [http://escholarship.org/uc/item/9c96x0p1 Chapter 4].&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in the [[Law of Social Cycle|Varnic theory]] of [[P.R. Sarkar]] an explicit accounting is made of social progress.

==Historical forerunners==
Interpretation of [[history]] as repeating cycles of Dark and Golden Ages was a common belief among ancient cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Social Theory: Its Origins, History, and Contemporary Relevance By Daniel W. Rossides. [https://books.google.com/books?id=TTYAGD7aKBkC&amp;lpg=PA69 Pg. 69]&lt;/ref&gt;

The more limited cyclical view of history defined as repeating cycles of events was put forward in the academic world in the 19th century in [[historiosophy]] (a branch of [[historiography]]) and is a concept that falls under the category of [[sociology]]. However, [[Polybius]], [[Ibn Khaldun]] (see [[Asabiyyah]]), and [[Giambattista Vico]] can be seen as precursors of this analysis. The [[Saeculum]] was identified in Roman times. In recent times, P. R. Sarkar in his [[Social cycle theory (Sarkar)|Social Cycle Theory]] has used this idea to elaborate his interpretation of history.

==19th and 20th century theories==
Among the prominent historiosophers&lt;!--(?) (removed the question mark from the article, "historiosopher" yields a bunch of results on google, for whatever it's worth. if the term is correct feel free to remove this comment)--&gt;, [[Russia]]n philosopher [[Nikolai Danilewski]] (1822–1885) is important. In ''Rossiia i Evropa'' (1869) he differentiated between various smaller [[civilization]]s (Egyptian, Chinese, Persian, Greek, Roman, German, and Slav, among others). He wrote that each civilization has a life cycle, and by the end of the 19th century the Roman-German civilization was in decline, while the Slav civilization was approaching its [[Golden Age]]. A similar theory was put forward by [[Oswald Spengler]] (1880–1936) who in his ''[[The Decline of the West|Der Untergang des Abendlandes]]'' (1918) also argued that the [[western world|Western civilization]] had entered its final phase of development and its decline was inevitable.

The first social cycle theory in sociology was created by [[Italy|Italian]] sociologist and economist [[Vilfredo Pareto]] (1848–1923) in his ''Trattato di Sociologia Generale'' (1916). He centered his theory on the concept of an [[elite]] [[social class]], which he divided into cunning 'foxes' and violent 'lions'. In his view of society, the [[power (sociology)|power]] constantly passes from the 'foxes' to the 'lions' and vice versa.

Sociological cycle theory was also developed by [[Pitirim A. Sorokin]] (1889–1968) in his ''Social and Cultural Dynamics'' (1937, 1943). He classified societies according to their 'cultural mentality', which can be ideational (reality is spiritual), sensate (reality is material), or idealistic (a synthesis of the two). He interpreted the contemporary West as a sensate civilization dedicated to [[technological progress]] and prophesied its fall into decadence and the emergence of a new ideational or idealistic era.

[[Alexandre Deulofeu]] (1903–1978) developed a mathematical model of social cycles that he claimed fit historical facts. He argued that civilizations and empires go through cycles in his book  ''Mathematics of History'' (in [[Catalan language|Catalan]], published in 1951). He claims that each civilization passes through a minimum of three 1700-year cycles. As part of civilizations, empires have an average lifespan of 550 years. He also stated that by knowing the nature of these cycles, it could be possible to modify the cycles in such a way that change could be peaceful instead of leading to war. Deulofeu believed he had found the origin of [[Romanesque art]], during the 9th century, in an area between [[Empordà]] and [[Roussillon]], which he argued was the cradle of the second cycle of western European civilization.

One of the most important recent findings in the study of the long-term dynamic social processes was the discovery of the political-demographic cycles as a basic feature of the dynamics of complex [[agrarian system]]s.

The presence of political-demographic cycles in the pre-modern history of [[Europe]] and [[China]], and in [[chiefdom]] level societies worldwide has been known for quite a long time,&lt;ref&gt;E.g., [[Michael Postan|Postan]] 1950, 1973; [[Marshall Sahlins|Sahlins]] 1963; Abel 1974, 1980; [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie|Ladurie]] 1974; Hodder 1978; [[Fernand Braudel|Braudel]] 1973; Chao 1986; H. T. Wright 1984; Cameron 1989; [[Jack Goldstone|Goldstone]] 1991; Kul'pin 1990; [[David G. Anderson|Anderson]] 1994; Mugruzin 1986, 1994, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; and already in the 1980s more or less developed [[mathematical models]] of demographic cycles started to be produced (first of all for Chinese "[[dynastic cycle]]s") (Usher 1989). At the moment we have a considerable number of such models (Chu and Lee 1994; Nefedov 1999, 2002, 2003, 2004; S. Malkov, Kovalev, and A. Malkov 2000; S. Malkov and A. Malkov 2000; Malkov and Sergeev 2002, 2004a, 2004b; Malkov et al. 2002; Malkov 2002, 2003, 2004; [[Peter Turchin|Turchin]] 2003, 2005a; [[Andrey Korotayev|Korotayev]] et al. 2006).

Recently the most important contributions to the development of the [[mathematical]] models of long-term ("secular") sociodemographic cycles have been made by Sergey Nefedov, [[Peter Turchin]], [[Andrey Korotayev]], and Sergey Malkov.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., [[Peter Turchin|Turchin, P.]] (2003) ''Historical Dynamics: Why States Rise and Fall''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Turchin P., Korotayev A. [http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=281&amp;Itemid=1 Population Dynamics and Internal Warfare: A Reconsideration]. ''[[Social Evolution &amp; History]]'' 5/2 (2006): 112–147; [[Korotayev]], A., Malkov, A., &amp; Khaltourina, D. (2006) [http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=172&amp;Itemid=70 ''Introduction to Social Macrodynamics: Secular Cycles and Millennial Trends.''] Moscow: URSS. {{ISBN|5-484-00559-0}}. [http://escholarship.org/uc/item/9c96x0p1 Chapter 4].&lt;/ref&gt; What is important is that on the basis of their models Nefedov, Turchin and Malkov have managed to demonstrate that sociodemographic cycles were a basic feature of complex agrarian systems (and not a specifically Chinese or European phenomenon).

The basic logic of these models is as follows:
* After the population reaches the ceiling of the [[carrying capacity]] of land, its growth rate declines toward near-zero values.
* The system experiences significant stress with decline in the living standards of the common population, increasing the severity of [[famine]]s, growing rebellions etc.
* As has been shown by Nefedov, most complex agrarian systems had considerable reserves for stability, however, within 50–150 years these reserves were usually exhausted and the [[system]] experienced a [[demographic]] collapse (a [[Malthusian catastrophe]]), when increasingly severe famines, [[epidemics]], increasing internal [[war]]fare and other disasters led to a considerable decline of [[population]].
* As a result of this collapse, free resources became available, per capita production and consumption considerably increased, the [[population growth]] resumed and a new sociodemographic cycle started.
It has become possible to model these dynamics mathematically in a rather effective way. Note that the modern theories of political-demographic cycles do not deny the presence of trend dynamics and attempt at the study of the interaction between cyclical and trend components of historical dynamics.

In [[historic preservation]], '''sustainable preservation''' is the idea that preservation has tangible ecological benefits, on the basis that the most sustainable building is one that is already built. Historic buildings can have advantages over new construction with their often central location, historic building materials, and unique characteristics of craftsmanship. Arguing for these connections is at least partially an outgrowth of the green building movement with its emphasis on new construction. Sustainable preservation borrows many of the same principles of [[sustainable architecture]], though is unique by focusing on older buildings versus new construction.  The term "sustainable preservation" is also utilized to refer to the preservation of global heritage, archaeological and historic sites through the creation of economically sustainable businesses which support such preservation, such as the   [[Sustainable Preservation Initiative]] and the [[Global Heritage Fund]].

== History ==
The [[U.S. Green Building Council]] (USGBC) has popularized sustainability initiatives since their founding in 1993. Their LEED certification allowed professionals to develop expertise in the field of green building. The LEED Green Building Rating System with benchmarks was established in 2000.

The [[Association for Preservation Technology International]] formed a "Sustainable Preservation Committee" in 2004 to provide an arena for discussion, and educate on the relationship between historic preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apti.org/about/technical.cfm#A5A|date=2009-05-31|title=Technical Committees|work=Association for Preservation Technology International}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among early discussions were a workshop in Halfax, held in 2005. This was followed a workshop on "Greenbuild &amp; LEED for Historic Building" in November 2006. The APTI annual conference in Montreal from October 22–26, 2008, also included a symposium on sustainable heritage conservation. 

The National Trust for Historic Preservation also included Sustainability among several issues the Trust works on. The Trust's position statement on sustainability is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.preservationnation.org/issues/sustainability/|date=2009-05-31|title=Historic Preservation &amp; Sustainability|work=National Trust for Historic Preservation}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Historic preservation can – and should – be an important component of any effort to promote sustainable development. The conservation and improvement of our existing built resources, including re-use of historic and older buildings, greening the existing building stock, and reinvestment in older and historic communities, is crucial to combating [[climate change]].

National Trust President Richard Moe, addressed the USGBC on November 20, 2008. His speech laid out several principles in an effort to find common ground:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.preservationnation.org/issues/sustainability/sustainability-preservation-1.html|date=2009-05-31|title=Sustainability Speeches|work=National Trust for Historic Preservation}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Promote a culture of reuse
# Reinvest at a Community Scale
# Value the Lessons of Heritage Buildings and Communities 
# Make Use of the Economic Advantages of Reuse, Reinvestment and Retrofits
# Re-imagine Historic Preservation Policies and Practices as They Relate to Sustainability
# Take Immediate and Decisive Action

[[The Kresge Foundation]] led a Green Building Initiative from 2003 to May 29, 2009. The initiative provided planning grants for nonprofit organizations that went on to build green buildings. The foundation also demonstrated their commitment to sustainability initiatives through construction of a green headquarters in Troy, Michigan. This building incorporated a historic building on the site with new construction. These facilities were completed in 2006, and in 2008 received the Platinum-level rating from the USGBC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kresge.org/index.php/headquarters/index/|date=2009-05-31|title=Our Green Headquarters|work=The Kresge Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Sirius Mystery''''' is a non-fiction book by [[Robert K. G. Temple]] first published by [[St. Martin's Press]] in 1976. Its second, 1998, edition is called '''''The Sirius Mystery: New Scientific Evidence of Alien Contact 5,000 Years Ago'''''.

==Overview==
The book presents the [[hypothesis]] that the [[Dogon people]] of [[Mali]], in west Africa, preserve a tradition of contact with intelligent extraterrestrial beings from the [[Sirius]] star system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news
  | last = Sheppard
  | first = R.Z.

  | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These beings, who are hypothesized to have taught the arts of civilization to humans, are claimed in the book to have originated the systems of the [[Pharaoh]]s of [[Egypt]], the [[Greek mythology|mythology of Greek civilization]], and the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]], among other things. Temple's theory was heavily based on his interpretation of the work of [[ethnography|ethnographers]] [[Marcel Griaule]] and [[Germaine Dieterlen]]. A substantial bulk of ''The Sirius Mystery'' consists of comparative linguistic and mythological scholarship, pointing out resemblances among Dogon, Egyptian and [[Sumer]]ian beliefs and symbols. Greek and Arab myths and words are considered to a lesser extent.

The "mystery" that is central to the book is how the Dogon allegedly acquired knowledge of [[Sirius B]], the [[white dwarf]] companion star of [[Sirius A]], invisible to the naked eye. Temple did not argue that the only way that the Dogon could have obtained what he understood to be accurate information on Sirius B was by contact with an advanced civilization; he considered alternative possibilities, such as a very ancient, advanced, and lost civilization that was behind the sudden appearance of advanced civilization in both [[Egypt]] and [[Sumeria]]. He personally found the theory of alien contact more convincing, but he did not claim certainty about it. [[Noah Brosch]] explained in his book ''Sirius Matters'' that cultural transfer could have taken place between 19th century French astronomers and Dogon tribe members during the observations of the [[Solar eclipse of April 16, 1893|solar eclipse on 16 April 1893]]. The expedition, led by [[Henri Deslandres]], stayed in the field for five weeks and it is reasonable that during this time many contacts with the locals took place, and that relatively modern astronomical knowledge was then transferred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brosch|first1=Noah|title=Sirius Matters|date=2008|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-8319-8|pages=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some doubts have been raised about the reliability of Griaule and Dieterlein's work on which ''The Sirius Mystery'' is based,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.ramtops.co.uk/dogon.html| title = The Dogon Revisited| accessdate = 2007-10-13| author = Bernard R.

The claims about the Dogons' astronomical knowledge have been challenged. For instance, the anthropologist Walter Van Beek, who studied the Dogon after Griaule and Dieterlen, found no evidence that the Dogon considered Sirius to be a double star and/or that astronomy was particularly important in their belief system.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zc3zw-YgOPkC&amp;pg=PA172&amp;dq=Sirians+Sagan&amp;ei=22u2SfPZKJi8M6LflfEL&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA180,M1 Holberg, Jay B. ''Sirius''] Springer 2007 {{ISBN|978-0-387-48941-4}} p176&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as Marcel Griaule's daughter [[Geneviève Calame-Griaule]] and an anthropologist, Luc de Heusch, came to criticize Van Beek's dismissal as "political" and riddled with "unchecked speculation", demonstrating a general ignorance of Dogon esoteric tradition.&lt;ref&gt;

==Reviews of claims==

===Ian Ridpath===
In 1978, Astronomer [[Ian Ridpath]] observed, in an article in the ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'', "The whole Dogon legend of Sirius and its companions is riddled with ambiguities, contradictions, and downright errors, at least if we try to interpret it literally."&lt;ref&gt;Ian Ridpath, {{cite web |url=http://www.csicop.org/si/7809/sirius.html |title=''Skeptical Inquirer'' |accessdate=2013-02-15 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030217073018/http://www.csicop.org/si/7809/sirius.html |archivedate=February 17, 2003 |df= }}, Fall 1978&lt;/ref&gt; Ridpath stated that while the information that the Dogon probably gained from Europeans to some extent resembles the facts about Sirius, the presumed original Dogon knowledge on the star is very far from the facts. Ridpath concluded that the information that resembles the facts about Sirius was probably ascertained by way of cultural contamination. More recent research suggests that the contaminator was Griaule himself.&lt;ref name="coppens"/&gt;

===Carl Sagan===
Astronomer [[Carl Sagan]] touched upon the issue in his book ''[[Broca's Brain]]'' (1979), seeing problems in Temple's hypothesis. As an example, Sagan believes that because the Dogon seem to have no knowledge of another planet beyond [[Saturn]] which has rings, that their knowledge is therefore more likely to have come from European, and not extraterrestrial, sources.&lt;ref name = cs-bb-1979&gt;{{Cite book

===James Oberg===
Journalist and skeptic [[James Oberg]] collected claims that have appeared concerning Dogon mythology in his 1982 book.&lt;ref&gt;James Oberg, "[http://www.debunker.com/texts/dogon.html Chapter 6, The Sirius Mystery]", in ''UFOs and Outer Space Mysteries'', (1982) Donning Press&lt;/ref&gt; According to Oberg, the Dogons' astronomical information resembles the knowledge and speculations of European astronomical knowledge of the late 1920s. The Dogon may have acquired their astronomical knowledge, including the information on Sirius, from European visitors before their mythology was recorded in the 1930s. Oberg also points out that the Dogon were not an isolated tribe, and thus it was not even necessary for outsiders to inform the Dogon about Sirius B. They could very well have acquired such knowledge abroad, passing it on to their tribe later. Sirius B was first observed in 1862, and had been predicted in 1844 on dynamic grounds. However, Oberg does concede that such assumptions of recent acquisition are "entirely circumstantial" and have no foundation in documented evidence.

===Jason Colavito===
The skeptic [[Jason Colavito]] counts ''The Sirius Mystery'' among the body of works in a tradition of ancient astronaut ideas that was ultimately inspired by [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s [[Cthulhu Mythos]] in his 2005 book ''[[The Cult of Alien Gods|The Cult of Alien Gods: H. P. Lovecraft and Extraterrestrial Pop Culture]]''.

==Unproven claims==
One unproven aspect of the reported Dogon knowledge of the Sirius system is the assertion that the Dogon knew of another star in the Sirius system, Emme Ya, or "larger than Sirius B but lighter and dim in magnitude." A dynamical study published in 1995, based on anomalous perturbations of Sirius B (suggestive of the star being gravitationally influenced by another body) concluded that the presence of a third star orbiting Sirius could not be ruled out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1995A&amp;A...299..621B |title=Is Sirius a triple star? |journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics  |volume=299 |pages=621–628}}&lt;/ref&gt; An apparent "third star" observed in the 1920s is now confirmed as a background object,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

{{Blockquote|Benest and Duvent found that stable orbits with a period of up to six years exist around Sirius A. There are no stable orbits around the less massive Sirius B which exceed three years. Therefore, if Sirius C exists, it must orbit Sirius A. It is also possible to conclude that such a star could in no way be responsible for the flurry of sightings from the 1920s, it would be too faint and too close to Sirius A to have ever been seen by visual observers.&lt;ref&gt;J.B. Holberg: "Sirius: brightest diamond in the night sky". 2007. pp168&lt;/ref&gt;|J.B. Holberg}}

The former study also concluded that while a triple system for Sirius could not be fully eliminated, the probability was low.

Temple's book and the debates that followed its release publicized the existence of the Dogon tribe among many [[New Age]] followers and proponents of [[ancient astronaut]] theories. Speculation about the Dogon on numerous websites is now mingled with fact, leading to wide misunderstanding among the public about Dogon mythology. Temple, however, has stated in the reprint of ''The Sirius Mystery'' (1999) that he in no way supports what he refers to as "sinister cults" that have been inspired by his book.&lt;ref name = rkgt-tsm-1976&gt;{{Cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2417">'''Transnational history''' is a field of [[history]] that looks at how developments within the history of one [[country]] have been shaped by developments outside of this country, e.g. how [[History of the British Isles|British history]] has been shaped by developments coming from [[France]], [[Germany]] or [[the US]]. The idea of transnationalism can be traced back to 1991, when [[Ian Tyrrell]] pioneered this approach but it was in the field of [[American Studies]], in the late 1990s, that the concept really was developed. Since then the term has been adopted by the field of history. 

As the concept is still relatively new with the field of history, a consensus has not emerged on how to define the term precisely. However, [[Denmark|Danish]] [[historian]] Nils Arne Sørensen emphasizes that an important feature of transnational history is to reject the [[nation state]] as the "natural" frame for historical analysis. This redirection of historical studies can be seen as countermove to the fact that the field of history was founded in the 19th century while the [[nationalism|nationalist]] movement was on the rise in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Nils Arne Sørensen (2009) "[https://tidsskrift.dk/historisktidsskrift/article/view/56424/76630 Den transnationale vending?]"i ''[[Historisk Tidsskrift (Denmark)|Historisk Tidsskrift]]'' Volume 109, Issue 2: 459-472.&lt;/ref&gt; Akira Iriye and Pierre-Yves Saunier define transnational history as having to do with the "connections and circulations" between societies in the [[modern age]].&lt;ref&gt;Akira Iriye and Pierre-Yves Saunier (2009) ''Palgrave Dictionary of Transnational History''. Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; Ian Tyrrell argues that transnational history is related to the [[Annales school]].&lt;ref&gt;Ian Tyrrell (2008) [https://iantyrrell.wordpress.com/what-is-transnational-history/ "What is transnational history?"] ''Ian Tyrell'' (blog)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Annals of the World page 1.jpg|thumb|''Annals of the World'' page 1 (English)]]

The '''Ussher chronology''' is a 17th-century [[chronology]] of the [[history]] of the world [[Biblical literalist chronology|formulated from a literal reading]] of the [[Old Testament]] by [[James Ussher]], the [[Archbishop of Armagh (Church of Ireland)|Archbishop of Armagh]] and [[Primate of All Ireland]]. The chronology is sometimes associated with [[young Earth creationism]], which holds that the Universe was created only a few millennia ago by God as described in the first two chapters of the [[Books of the Bible|biblical book]] of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]].  Ussher fell into disrepute in the 19th century.

Published in 1650, the full title of Ussher's work in Latin is ''Annales Veteris Testamenti, a prima mundi origine deducti, una cum rerum Asiaticarum et Aegyptiacarum chronico, a temporis historici principio usque ad Maccabaicorum initia producto'' ("Annals of the Old Testament, deduced from the first origins of the world, the chronicle of Asiatic and Egyptian matters together produced from the beginning of historical time up to the beginnings of [[Maccabees]]").

Ussher's work was his contribution to the long-running theological debate on the age of the [[Earth]]. This was a major concern of many [[Christian]] scholars over the centuries.

The chronology is sometimes called the Ussher{{endash}}Lightfoot chronology because [[John Lightfoot]] published a similar chronology in 1642–1644. This, however, is a misnomer, as the chronology is based on Ussher's work alone and not that of Lightfoot. Ussher deduced that the first day of [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]] fell upon, October 23, 4004&amp;nbsp;BC, in the [[proleptic Julian calendar]], near the [[autumnal equinox]]. Lightfoot similarly deduced that Creation began at nightfall near the autumnal equinox, but in the year 3929 BC.

Ussher's proposed date of [[4004 BC]] differed little from [[Dating Creation#Date of Creation according to the Pentateuch|other Biblically-based estimates]], such as those of [[Jose ben Halafta]] (3761 BC), [[Bede]] (3952 BC), Ussher's near-contemporary [[Joseph Justus Scaliger|Scaliger]] (3949 BC), [[Johannes Kepler]] (3992 BC) or [[Sir Isaac Newton]] (c. 4000 BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William W. Hay|title=Experimenting on a Small Planet: A Scholarly Entertainment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=teJYlWH9vg4C&amp;pg=PA63|accessdate=November 17, 2013|year=2012|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783642285608|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Dubious|date=October 2017}} Ussher was influenced by the same account as the [[apocrypha]]l [[Book of Jasher (biblical references)|Book of Jasher]], dating the worldwide flood to 2349 BC and the birth of [[Terah]] in 2127 BC. The date of 4000 BC as the creation of [[Adam]] was at least partially influenced by the widely held belief that the Earth was approximately 5600 years old (2000 to Abraham, 2000 from Abraham to the birth of [[Christ (title)|Christ]], and 1600 years from Christ to Ussher), corresponding to the six days of Creation, on the grounds that "one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day" ({{bibleverse|2|Peter|3:8|KJV}}). This tradition was believed to indicate that Jesus would return in 2000 AD,&lt;ref name="Newport2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kenneth G. C. Newport|title=Apocalypse and millennium: studies in biblical eisegesis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f3Cm9ALJbe0C&amp;pg=PA104|accessdate=23 March 2011|date=28 August 2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-77334-8|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RowlandBarton2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christopher Rowland|author2=John Barton|title=Apocalyptic in history and tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CrcoAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=23 March 2011|year=2002|publisher=Sheffield Academic Press|isbn=978-0-8264-6208-4|pages=233–252}}&lt;/ref&gt; more than six thousand years after 4004 BC. Modern proponents of this interpretation hold that the creation date 4004 BC could be inaccurate.

==Ussher's methods==
The chronologies of Ussher and other biblical scholars corresponded so closely because they used much the same methodology to calculate key events recorded in the [[Bible]]. Establishing the chronologies is complicated by the fact that the Bible was compiled by different authors over several centuries with lengthy chronological gaps, making it difficult to do a simple totaling of Biblical ages and dates. In his article on Ussher's calendar, James Barr has identified three distinct periods that Ussher and others had to tackle:&lt;ref&gt;James Barr, 1984-85. "[https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publicationPid=uk-ac-man-scw:1m1647&amp;datastreamId=POST-PEER-REVIEW-PUBLISHERS-DOCUMENT.PDF Why the World Was Created in 4004 BC: Archbishop Ussher and Biblical Chronology]", ''Bulletin of the John Rylands University Library of Manchester'' '''67:'''603–607.&lt;/ref&gt;

# "''Creation to Abraham's migration.''" This section is fairly easy to calculate, using the chronological data in Genesis 5 and 11, which gives an unbroken male lineage, with dates, from the creation to Abraham being called out of Ur of the Chaldeans. Ussher uses the chronology found in the Masoretic text instead of the alternative chronologies found in the Septuagint and Samaritan Pentateuch. Ussher fixed this period as 2082 years, from 4004 to 1922 BC.
# ''"Abraham's migration to Solomon's temple."'' Ussher wrote the time from Abram leaving Haran to the Exodus was 430 years (400 years of persecution, 30 years after left Haran) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/AnnalsOfTheWorld/Annals#page/n23/mode/2up|title=Annals of the World|last=Ussher|first=James|publisher=|year=1650|isbn=|location=|pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{bibleverse||1 Kings|6|KJV}} gives 480 years from the Exodus to the beginning of Solomon's temple in the fourth year of Solomon's reign. These 910 years span from 1922 to 1012 BC.
# ''"Period of the temple laid to the Babylonian captivity."'' This period is the most difficult to calculate, due to repeated difficulties in correlating the regnal years of the kingdoms of Judah and Israel. The simple addition of the reigns of Judah's kings gives 430 years, but by positing a few overlapping reigns, Ussher shortens this to 424 years: 1012 to 588 BC.

After reckoning the years from creation to the last kings of Judah, Ussher used {{bibleverse|2 Kings|25:27}} to establish the length of time from the creation to the accession of Babylonian king Amel-Marduk (also known as Evil-Merodach).&lt;ref name="barr-marduk"&gt;James Barr, 1984-85. "[https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publicationPid=uk-ac-man-scw:1m1647&amp;datastreamId=POST-PEER-REVIEW-PUBLISHERS-DOCUMENT.PDF Why the World Was Created in 4004 BC: Archbishop Ussher and Biblical Chronology]", ''Bulletin of the John Rylands University Library of Manchester'' '''67:''' 579-580.&lt;/ref&gt; He then used information from Babylonian, Greek, and Roman sources to fix the date of Amel-Marduk's enthronment at 562 BC (after Nebuchadnezzar's death), from which he was able to deduce a creation in 4004 BC.&lt;ref name="barr-marduk" /&gt;

In fixing the date of Jesus' birth, Ussher took account of an error perpetrated by [[Dionysius Exiguus]], the founder of the [[Anno Domini]] numbering system. Ussher chose 5 BC as Christ's birth year&lt;ref name=Epistle/&gt; because [[Josephus]] indicated that the death of [[Herod the Great]] occurred in 4 BC.&lt;ref&gt;John P. Pratt, [http://www.johnpratt.com/items/docs/herod/herod.html "Yet another eclipse for Herod"], ''The Planetarian'', vol. 19, no. 4, Dec. 1990, pp. 8–14.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, for the Gospel of Matthew to be correct, Jesus could not have been born after that date.

The season in which Creation occurred was the subject of considerable [[theology|theological]] debate in Ussher's time. Many scholars proposed it had taken place in the spring, the start of the Babylonian, Chaldean and other cultures' chronologies. Others, including Ussher, thought it more likely that it had occurred in the [[autumn]], largely because that season marked the beginning of the Jewish year.

Ussher further narrowed down the date by using the [[Hebrew calendar|Jewish calendar]] to establish the "first day" of creation as falling on a Sunday near the autumnal equinox.&lt;ref&gt;James Barr, 1984-85. "[https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publicationPid=uk-ac-man-scw:1m1647&amp;datastreamId=POST-PEER-REVIEW-PUBLISHERS-DOCUMENT.PDF Why the World Was Created in 4004 BC: Archbishop Ussher and Biblical Chronology]", ''Bulletin of the John Rylands University Library of Manchester'' '''67:''' 591.&lt;/ref&gt; The day of the week was a backward calculation from the six days of creation with God resting on the seventh, which in the Jewish calendar is Saturday—hence, Creation began on a Sunday. The astronomical tables that Ussher probably used were [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]]'s ''Tabulae Rudolphinae'' (''[[Rudolphine Tables]]'', 1627). Using them, he would have concluded that the equinox occurred on Tuesday, October 25, only one day earlier than the traditional day of its creation, on the fourth day of Creation week, Wednesday, along with the Sun, Moon, and stars {{bibleverse||Genesis|1:16|KJV}}. Modern equations place the autumnal equinox of 4004 BC on Sunday, October 23 (by the Julian calendar).&lt;ref&gt;[http://emr.cs.iit.edu/home/reingold/calendar-book/Calendrica.html Calendrica] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050216102054/http://emr.cs.iit.edu/home/reingold/calendar-book/Calendrica.html |date=2005-02-16 }} The position of the Sun at the autumnal equinox is 180°, where 0° is its position at the vernal equinox.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ussher's understanding of creation placed the "first day" referred to in {{bibleverse||Genesis|1:5|KJV}} on October 23, but with a "pre-creation" event, which he identified as the "beginning of time" occurring the previous night.&lt;ref&gt;James Barr, 1984-85. "[https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publicationPid=uk-ac-man-scw:1m1647&amp;datastreamId=POST-PEER-REVIEW-PUBLISHERS-DOCUMENT.PDF Why the World Was Created in 4004 BC: Archbishop Ussher and Biblical Chronology]", ''Bulletin of the John Rylands University Library of Manchester'' '''67:''' 592.&lt;/ref&gt; Ussher referred to his dating of creation on the first page of ''Annales'' in Latin and on the first page of its English translation ''Annals of the World'' (1658). In the following extract from the English translation, the phrase "in the year of the Julian Calendar" refers to the Julian Period, of which year 1 is 4713 BC, and therefore year 710 is 4004 BC.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. Ge. 1:1 This beginning of time, according to our chronology, happened at the start of the evening preceding the 23rd day of October in the year of the Julian Calendar, 710.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ussher provides a slightly different time in his "Epistle to the Reader" in his Latin and English works:&lt;ref name=Epistle&gt;James Ussher, [https://books.google.com/books?id=VrHER1jYzhIC&amp;pg=PA9 "Epistle to the Reader"], ''Annals of the World'' (2003) page 9.&lt;/ref&gt; "I deduce that the time from the creation until midnight, January 1, 1 AD was 4003 years, seventy days and six hours." Six hours before midnight would be 6 pm.

==Ussher's chronology today==
{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2017}}&lt;!--first two paragraphs have no citations--&gt;

By the middle of the 19th century, Ussher's chronology came under increasing attack from supporters of [[Uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]], who argued that Ussher's "young Earth" was incompatible with the increasingly accepted view of an Earth much more ancient than Ussher's.  It became generally accepted that the Earth was tens, perhaps even hundreds of millions of years old. Ussher fell into disrepute among [[theology|theologian]]s as well; in 1890, Princeton professor [[William Henry Green]] wrote a highly influential article in ''[[Bibliotheca Sacra]]'' entitled "Primeval Chronology" in which he strongly criticised Ussher. He concluded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We conclude that the Scriptures furnish no data for a chronological computation prior to the life of Abraham; and that the Mosaic records do not fix and were not intended to fix the precise date either of the Flood or of the creation of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genevaninstitute.org/syllabus/unit-two-theology-proper/lesson-5-the-decree-of-creation/primeval-chronology-by-dr-william-henry-green/ Primeval Chronology]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The similarly conservative theologian [[B. B. Warfield]] reached the same conclusion in "On The Antiquity and Unity of the Human Race",&lt;ref&gt;''Princeton Theological Review'', 1911&lt;/ref&gt; commenting that "it is precarious in the highest degree to draw chronological inferences from genealogical tables".

Nevertheless, Professor [[James Barr (biblical scholar)|James Barr]] (then Oriel Professor of the interpretation of the Holy Scripture, Oxford University) wrote in 1984:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
…probably, so far as I know, there is no professor of Hebrew or Old Testament at any world-class university who does not believe that the writer(s) of Genesis 1–11 intended to convey to their readers the ideas that… the figures contained in the Genesis genealogies provided by simple addition a chronology from the beginning of the world up to later stages in the biblical story…&lt;ref&gt;James Barr, Oriel professor of the interpretation of the Holy Scripture, Oxford University, England, in a letter to David C. C. Watson, April 23, 1984. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Archbishop Ussher's chronology has in recent years been subject to artistic criticism, including in the play ''[[Inherit the Wind (play)|Inherit the Wind]]'' (based on the [[Scopes Monkey Trial]]) and the [[fantasy]] novel ''[[Good Omens]]'' which alleges that "he is off by a quarter of an hour". A different viewpoint comes from [[Stephen Jay Gould]], who, while totally disagreeing with Ussher's chronology, nevertheless wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url = http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_house-ussher.html | title = Fall in the House of Ussher | author = [[Stephen Jay Gould]] | journal = Natural History | volume = 100 |date = November 1991 | pages = 12–21 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120303202324/http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_house-ussher.html | archivedate = March 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I shall be defending Ussher's chronology as an honorable effort for its time and arguing that our usual ridicule only records a lamentable small-mindedness based on mistaken use of present criteria to judge a distant and different past
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Ussher represented the best of scholarship in his time. He was part of a substantial research tradition, a large community of intellectuals working toward a common goal under an accepted methodology…
